  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, October 1, 1897. 
Str: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of this 
office for the year ending June 30, 1897: 
Total enrollment in schools and colleges.—There were enrolled in the 
schools and colleges, both public and private, during the school year 
1896-97, 16,255,093 pupils, being an increase of 257,896 over the pre- 
ceding year. Of this total 1,513,016 pupils were in private institu- 
tions and 14,742,077 in public institutions. Comparing these figures 
with those of the previous year it will be seen that the increase of 
pupils is confined to the public institutions. In fact there appears to 
have been aslight decrease in the total number attending private insti- 
tutions, namely, about 14 per cent. This is doubtless due to the long 
continuance of what is called ‘‘hard times.” When manufacturing 
and commercial enterprise is checked, capital becomes timid and the 
surplus of labor which has hitherto been engaged in the two classes 
of employment represented in the manufacture and exchange of 
goods is obliged to fall back upon agriculture. The large proportion 
of the laborers engaged in these two employments has originally come 
from the farm population, and turning from farming to manufactur- 
ing and commerce the population consumes the products of agricul- 
ture and creates a better market for the farm, while on the other hand 
it cheapens the products of manufacture and lessens the cost of the 
exchange of goods, so that the farmer gains in three ways, first by 
having fewer farmers to compete with, second by having a market 
near at hand, and third by having the cost of transportation of all 
the goods which he receives from a distance or sends to a distance 
reduced. With these facts in mind it is very easy to understand how 
a check in commerce and manufactures affects disastrously the 
wealth of the nation. The shrinking of fortunes and incomes affects 
the private school. 
Besides these pupils enrolled in public and private institutions 
classed as elementary schools, secondary schools, and higher educa- 
tional institutions, there are pupils enrolled in various special schools 
not included in the above figures. These items are as follows:

The miscellaneous in the above table includes such institutions as 
schools of music, oratory, elocution, schools of various arts, such as 
cooking, ete. This gives 16,648,287 as the grand total. 
THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
The expression ‘‘common schools” is used in this office to include 
public schools of elementary (first eight years’ course of study) and 
secondary grades (ninth to twelfth year’s course of study), no insti- 
tutions of higher education being included, although the State uni- 
versities are supported from public funds. Nearly allof the common 
schools throughout the United States are supported entirely by publie 
taxation and the proceeds of the school funds. In a few instances 
these public funds are eked out by small tuition fees paid by the 
parents. 
The first of the following tables gives a condensed summary of the 
common school statistics compiled from the data furnished this office 
by the State superintendents. The increase in pupils over last year 
is 273,414. The table shows the comparative items for nearly three 
decades. In 27 years the enrollment in the common schools has 
increased from about seven and one-half millions to fourteen and 
two-thirds millions. The proportion of the population enrolled in 
the common schools has also increased from 19 per cent to over 204 
per cent. This fact is to be accounted for by the increase in the 
growth of cities. An urban population provides more generously for 
the schooling of its people. But the effect of the urban growth is 
seen more fully in the increase of the average length of the school 
term in days. While in 1870 it was 132 days for the entire United 
States, in 1897 it had increased to 140.4 days, and while there was an 
average of 49 days for each person of school age (5 to 18 years) in 
1870, in 1897 the average had risen to 67 days. 
In the second table, showing general financial statistics, it is seen 
that the public schools, including elementary schools and high schools, 
received for their support during the year 1896-97 the sum of $188,- 
641,243. This is an increase of a little more than $7,000,000 over the 
previous year. But it will be seen that while the expenses in 1870 
amounted to $1.75 per day, in 1896-97 the amount was $2.62 on the aver- 
age for each inhabitant, and this for the pupils who actually attended 
school amounted to $18.57 in the year 1896-97, while it amounted to 
$15.20 in the year 1870-71. This addition to the cost of tuition is 
partly due to the increased number of days in which the pupils actually 
attend school, and partly due to the increased amount paid for salaries 
of teachers, improved school buildings and apparatus. Each pupil

  enrolled attended seventeen more days in the year 1896-97 than in the 
year 1870-71, being an increase of over 20 per cent in the amount of 
schooling received. Allowing 20 per cent for this increase of the 
school term, about 30 per cent increase in expense must be allowed 
for better salaries, the cost of supervision, school buildings and 
apparatus.

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
  As shown above, the enrollment in the State common schools for 
1896-97 was 14,652,492. This includes the enrollment in the public 
schools of the 578 cities of 8,000 population and over. In these cities 
the number of pupils enrolled was 3,590,875, or 24.50 per cent of the 
common-school enrollment for the United States. There was an 
increase of 106,620, or 3.06 per cent, in the enrollment in the public 
schools of cities in 1896-97 over the previous year, while there was a 
decrease of 24,151, or 2.85 per cent, in the estimated enrollment in 
private and parochial schools. The enrollment in these private 
schools in cities, as reported to the office by city superintendents, was 
824,609. 
The average daily attendance in the city public schools was 2,687,758, 
an increase of about 5 per cent over the preceding year. The number 
of supervising officers in the city systems was 3,859 and the number 
of teachers 74,117, an increase of 5.39 per cent in the number of 
teachers. The number of buildings used for school purposes was 
8,604, while the number of sittings was 3,397,275, an increase of less 
than 1 percent over the previous year. The expenditure for teaching 
and supervision aggregated $48,772,485, an increase of 4.33 per cent, 
while the total expenditure was $84,866,092, an increase of $4,823,974, 
or 6.03 per cent, over the amount expended in 1895-96. 
The urban population in 1870 was almost 21 per cent of the whole, 
but in 1890 it had risen to nearly 30 per cent. 
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING PER INHABITANT. 
In reply to the question, How much schooling is each inhabitant 
receiving on the basis of the present attendance? I drew up two tables 
some years ago which I have reprinted with additions from time to 
time. If the conditions existing in the year 1896-97 were continued 
indefinitely, what would be the average amount of schooling per indi- 
vidual, counting it in school years of two hundred days each? I find 
that if we include public and private schools and higher education as 
well as elementary and secondary, the amount that each inhabitant 
would receive is 4.94 years. Table V shows that the divisions ofsthe 
United States differ very much, the lowest average being 2.83 years, 
and the highest average being 6.50 years. The results are shown in 
comparative form beginning with 1870. In Table VI the average 
amount of schooling in the public schools alone is shown, omitting 
the private schools.

Education in Great Britain and Lreland.—The statistics of educa- 
tion in Great Britain presented in Chapter I show a vast develop- 
ment of the system of elementary schools. Since the passage of the 
education law of 1870, which applied to England and Wales, the 
school enrollment in this division of the Kingdom has increased by 
226 per cent, while the increase in population has been only 39 per 
cent. The improved condition of the schools is illustrated by the 
relative increase in average attendance; in 1874 it was 67 per cent 
of the enrollment; in 1896 it had risen to 81 per cent. The change 
in the composition of the teaching force is an additional sign of 
improvement. (Pupil teachers, who formed the majority of the teach- 
ing force in 1874, were but 29 per cent of the total in 1896) 
In Scotland, whose schools are administered under the law of 1872, 
there was much less room for improvement, as education had long 
been a general interest. In that country, however, the law, by giving 
formal organization and Government support to the work, facilitated 
its growth. The statistical survey of Scotland carried back over a 
period of sixteen years shows an increase of 33 per cent in enroll- 
ment as against an increase of 13 per cent in the population. The 
average attendance, which in 1880 was 78 per cent of the enrollment, 
had risen in 1896 to 81 per cent. @he decrease in the number of 
pupil teachers during the same time has also been marked) From 44 
per cent of the total in 1880 they fell to 26 per cent in 1896. 
The withdrawal of the English education bill of 1896, whose scope
-P-A-G-E-16
      
      XVI 
  REPORT     OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
and fate were considered in my previous report, proved to be final, 
and no further attempt has been made to reorganize the system as a 
whole. <A new bill for the relief of voluntary schools (private schools, 
chiefly denominational) was presented upon the reassembling of Par- 
liament in 1897 and was passed. It places an additional grant from 
the public treasury, amounting for the current year to $3,000,000, at 
the disposal of parochial schools without any provision for public 
control, and also relieves their property from taxation. The bill was 
opposed by the Liberals and regarded with disfavor by many Con- 
servatives as establishing a dangerous precedent with respect to the 
application of public money, and further, as introducing the principle 
of special legislation into the school system. Immediately a second 
bill was introduced and passed for the relief of board schools in poor 
districts. It proposed an appropriation ($553,000) for this object, and 
is chiefly noteworthy as continuing the policy of special legislation. 
The law for the relief of parochial schools provides for the federa- 
tion of schools and the allotment of the due proportion of the relief 
grant to the governing body of the federation. The provision, it was 
felt, would greatly increase the ecclesiastical influence in school mat- 
ters, and such appears to be its outcome. 
The text of the law, the grounds on which it is supported, and the 
opposition it has excited are considered fully in Chapter I. Its bear- 
ing is shown more clearly by a review of the successive laws and offi- 
cial regulations by which the present system has been developed. On 
the whole, it would appear that the recent legislation has increased 
rather than allayed the causes of friction in the school system. 
The survey of elementary education in London which completes 
the chapter gives emphasis to the action of local authority in the Eng- 
lish system. The London school board has vast powers as well as 
onerous duties. It deals with a population of 4,500,000. In 1870 the 
only school accommodation was in parochial and other private schools 
and sufficed for about half the school population. The London board, 
created under the law of 1870, had not only to make up the deficiency, 
but to keep pace with the ever-growing child population, which has 
increased by 45 per cent since that date. This task has been accom- _ 
plished. Gn London, as in most of the English cities, the board 
schools have outstripped the parochial in number and efficiency, pro- 
viding for 66 per cent of the school population as against a ratio of 
48 per cent for the board schools of the country at large) Certain of 
the private elementary schools, however, rank very high and offer 
important suggestions as to the means of meeting the wants of the 
poorest class. This is particularly true of the Jews’ free school. In 
all the board schools, tuition, school books, and other appliances are 
free. The expenditure amounted to $11,700,000 in 1896, or a gross 
cost per capita of average attendance of $19.54. The rate, which is 
regarded as enormous by critics of the schools, is below the average 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. XVIT 
  per capita in cities of the United States. The return of a progress- 
ive board at the late election assures the continuance of a generous 
policy. 
The provision for dealing with truant children and the development 
of evening schools are important features of the policy of the board. 
In the provision of higher-grade board schools London has done 
less than Manchester, Sheffield, and several other cities. There are, 
however, many private and corporate agencies in the metropolis 
engaged in providing secondary and technical instruction for the 
people. Their nature and work are briefly treated in the chapter 
considered. 
Education in France.—The principal event in the current history 
of education in France presented in Chapter II is the transforma- 
tion of the State faculties into autonomous universities by a law of 
1896. The law is the culmination of a series of measures dating back 
to 1885. The universities are not thereby freed entirely from the con- 
trol of the Government. This is still maintained in respect to the 
appointment of professors and the requirements for degrees, which 
are in fact State titles, carrying professional and official privileges. 
Nor are the universities deprived of State appropriations, from which 
in fact their income is chiefly derived. The university councils will, 
however, have control of the fees, excepting those incurred in respect 
to degrees, of the university property and the adjustment of the 
internal affairs. It is certain that local effort will be greatly stimu- 
lated by the new relations. 
The universities that have their seats in the great centers of com- 
merce and industry naturally enter upon the new order with great 
confidence; for the smaller universities, the hope is expressed that 
they will specialize according to the wants or interests of the region— 
technical, historical, or philological, as the case may be—and thus 
become strong by force of important specialties. 
The increase of attendance in church schools of ‘‘secondary” grade 
excites interest in view of the fact that the enrollment in the State 
lyeées and local publie colleges has remained stationary for several 
years. The ‘‘secondary” schools include lyeées and communal col- 
‘ leges and correspond, not to our high schools, but to the gymnasia of 
Germany. Their course covers two years of our college work. They 
are the schools of liberal culture and their graduates exercise an 
immense influence, hence the State desires to maintain its ascend- 
ancy in this department. (it appears that, while in respect to attend- 
ance the status of the national schools is not entirely satisfactory, 
they contribute a much larger proportion of students to the special 
schools of high order than the rival institutions) This is an important 
matter, as the graduates of the special schools enter into the most 
influential posts in the public service. 
The law of 1893 respecting the salaries of primary teachers, which 
ED 97——IL 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
XVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  went into effect the present year, improves somewhat the average 
condition of the teachers. 
The superior primary schools of France, corresponding to high 
schools in this country, have had remarkable growth under the com- 
bined efforts of the Government and local authorities, and offer very 
important lessons in the organization and varying adaptations of 
schools of this class. Their scope and work are set forth very fully 
in this chapter.) The continued and successful efforts for adult edu- 
cation are also noted. A paper translated from M. Boutmy on the 
reform of the baccalaureate, and the address of M. Bréal before the 
“* Association for the Encouragement of Greek Studies” on the genius 
of the Greek language, complete the survey of education in France. 
Education in Norway and Denmark.—The general trend of educa- 
tion in Norway and Denmark, as well as in Sweden, is toward the 
adoption of urban improvements in the schools. Villages are grow- 
ing into cities, and new villages are beginning in the rural sections. 
The ambulatory school (in which the teacher taught from house to 
house), formerly a necessity in the thinly settled regions of these 
countries, is being replaced by the village and city school, with its 
centralization of effort. 
The youth of the rural section gravitates to the city, where he can 
find better advantages not only in the school, but in the shop of the 
manufacturer or the merchant. For new inventions in the way of 
machinery are making it possible to produce the raw material of food 
and clothing by means of fewer laborers; hence the rural regions, 
where the raw material is produced, are relatively decreasing in popu- 
lation, the surplus of laborers set free by machinery removing to vil- 
lages and engaging in manufactures, commerce, and transportation. 
Fewer people being needed for the production of raw material, more 
people are available for finishing goods and for the production of 
articles of luxury and creature comfort. More people are available, 
too, for the higher occupations, that deal with the protection of man 
and provide for his culture. (‘The census from decade to decade shows 
in civilized countries an increase of people engaged in the collection 
and diffusion of information; engaged in scientific discovery, in 
the work of teaching, and in™beneyolent and religious enterprises) 
The protective employments, ineluding first those engaged for the 
protection of the health of the community, increase, and we have 
more physicians, more experts in various kinds of diseases, and more 
persons engaged in the scientific investigation of the causes and pre- 
vention of pestilent epidemics, and also chronic diseases that arise 
from malaria; more persons are engaged in the protection of property, 
not only the class of lawyers, but insurance agents of many kinds. 
t is the most comforting reflection that comes to us in this age of 
progress, namely, that nature is being subdued for the uses of man 
and man himself stimulated to fit himself for a higher range of employ-
-P-A-G-E-19
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. xIx 
ments than those which deal with the collecting of raw material and 
the first rude appliances of manufacturing. The financial statistics 
of civilized countries show a rapid increase in productive power. 
While some, mostly rural countries, such as Russia, Austria, and 
Italy, produce from 11 to 20 cents a day for each inhabitant, countries 
in which the urban industries are very prominent, as in France, Bel- 
gium, England, and the United States, produce from 40 to 50 cents a 
day for each inhabitant. Hence it happens that in England three 
families out of ten receive an annual income of $1,000 and upwards. 
The population of France does equally well; and, as in Great Britain 
and France productive industry finds its highest realization, articles 
of human comfort, protection, and culture are cheapest there and 
within the means of the laboring classes. 
In the Scandinavian countries the influence of this struggle to con- 
quer nature by machinery and elevate the employments of men is 
beginning to be felt. Denmark leads and Sweden follows. Norway 
follows at a greater distance, but with an assured progress. The edu- 
cational statistics from year to year from these countries prove that 
more attention is paid to the development of mechanical skill among 
the people. At first the sloyd and ather industrial schools did not 
show the marked influence of esthetic studies. Later, however, the 
examples of France and Belgium have had their influence, and more 
attention is being paid to the cultivation of taste as the chief factor 
in enhancing the value of productions. 
In Chapters III and IV of this report many details are given show- 
ing the progress in those countries in the establishment of manual 
training and in the coeducation of men and women in the universities; 
the improved facilities for the professional education of teachers; the 
inerease of pupils in the technical studies and in modern languages, 
and in general the larger appropriations for the support of schools. 
Education in central Europe.—Chapter V of the report contains a 
translation of Mr. H. Scherer’s review of educational currents of 
thought in Europe in 1895. His article indicates the increased atten- 
tion that is paid to psychology, and more especially to sociology. Up 
to within a few years the principle of individualism as enounced 
by Rousseau prevailed, and the social whole was considered an acci- 
dent of human nature rather than its substance. It is likely that the 
reaction which is now bringing more and more theoretical emphasis 
upon social organization will go too far, and that it will lay too much 
stress upon the institutional life of the human being, but this danger 
does not threaten us at present. There is so much ground to be cov- 
ered before the dangerous individualism of Rousseau is corrected 
that we are not likely to see the triumph of the principles of socialism 
and communism in the present generation. (Mr. Scherer has well 
indicated the importance of studying education from the standpoint 
of the civilization of the time.) What Germans call Kultur-Geschichte
-P-A-G-E-20
    xXx REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  is the basis of intelligent study of all institutions of society, and espe- 
cially of the system of education. One of the first fruits of this study 
of education from the standpoiit of social science is the attention 
given to the weaklings in society, whether the weaklings in intellect, 
or in thrift, or in morals. The paupers, criminals, and insane are 
recruited from these classes. \Statesmanship now gives more atten- 
tion to the causes of crime and to its cure, while formerly it paid 
\attention only to its punishment. Special schools for children of 
limited mental capacity is the second topic in the fifth chapter. It 
discusses a report based upon statistics published by the Prussian 
minister of education, which offers a comparison between the condi- 
tion of these schools in 1892 and their condition in 1896. Ct is now 
fseen clearly that there should be a medical examination of school 
‘children in all schools, and that the diagnosis of the child should in 
\many cases furnish hints for the school programme to which he is as- 
signed. The increase of secondary schools in Prussia is noteworthy, 
but still more noteworthy is the instruction now given in Germany 
with reference to the trades and arts. Germany, before all other 
nations, strives to govern its national housekeeping by the systematic 
results of intelligence. The Government, for instance, discovers that 
its people do not consume as much sugar per inhabitant as more 
favored commercial countries, such as England and France, and yet, 
having a northern climate, it should have the benefit of the more carbon 
which the sugar furnishes. It finds that the world is depending on 
the inhabitants of the tropics for the production of this article. Why 
should not some method be adopted by which people in the temperate 
zone, people living in Saxony and Prussia, for example, can produce 
their own sugar? A commission appointed on this subject discovers 
that the most available plant for this purpose is the beet. The Govy- 
ernment at once stimulates beet-root raising by offering bounties on 
' the sugar that is exported from the country. To the astonishment of 
the world, in a few years the beet-root sugar of the world exceeds the 
eane sugar in the ratio of 9 to 7; 4,500,000 tons of beet-root sugar, 
3,500,000 tons of cane sugar. The old motto, ‘‘ Perseverance con- 
quers all things,” shall read, ‘“‘ Rational insight conquers all things.” 
Again, Germany sees that its own national quota from.productive 
industry is not much more than one-half as much per inhabitant as 
the production of Great Britain and France. To be the strongest 
nation it is requisite to be the richest nation. The production of raw 
material in great amounts does not suffice to make a rich people. The 
greatest agricultural countries, namely, southern Russia, the South 
American States, the prairies of the Mississippi Valley, do not produce 
wealth like the cities of England and France and the Atlantic coast 
of the United States. Nor are the countries which have only man- 
ufactures besides agriculture the richest peoples; it is also requisite 
to have a certain quota of the people engaged in commerce. Since

  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. XXI 
1875 Germany has been the theater of the most wonderful transfor- 
mation in this matter of manufactures and commerce that the 
world has ever seen. Its progress is felt by all rival nations. It 
would seem that Germany is the pedagogic nation, the educator of 
the world, not only in schools, but in the organization of armies, the 
conduct of wars, also in the development of manufactures, the divi- 
sion of labor among its people, and in the building up of a commerce. 
Other nations finding out what Germany is doing will adopt the same 
methods, and a progress initiated throughout the civilized world will 
produce rapid changes for the better. At the rates of progress going 
on during the thirty years from 1850 to 1880 the United States might 
produce a dollar a day for each man, woman, and child by Anno 
Domini 1950, but the progress in the decade from 1880 to 1890 was 
much more rapid than this. The tendency of the introduction of 
machinery to aid the hand laborer is to increase by the geometrical 
ratio rather than arithmetical ratio. 
In the fifth chapter, also, there is a discussion relating to the propor- 
tion of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews in the secondary schools of 
Germany. The data are given and interesting deductions drawn by 
Professor Von Mayr. The American teacher will be greatly inter- 
ested to read the judicious remarks of Dr. Ernst Schlee on the recent 
movements of education in the United States; also the views of Dr. 
Otto W. Beyer on the report of the English Royal Commission on 
secondary education. 
Commercial education.—In Chapter VI a brief oie, comprehensive 
statement of what is done for commercial education in a large num- 
ber of European countries is given. The German movement, already 
alluded to, has probably stimulated the effort which is going on in 
many countries in the way of improving the quality of commercial 
education. These schools not only teach penmanship, bookkeeping 
and arithmetic, typewriting, telegraphy, and banking, but they take up 
commercial law, and the manners and customs of foreign commercial 
agencies, the method of preparing goods for foreign markets, the 
history and social status of foreign countries. In the report of this 
Bureau for 1895-96 a remarkable article on commercial schools in 
Europe, prepared by Prof. E. J. James for the American Bankers’ 
Association, is given in Chapter XV, pp. 721-837. That report shows 
how the students of the commercial school are set to work studying 
the raw materials of industry in a comparative manner, learning the 
good and bad features of those productions in each quarter of the 
world, learning how they are produced and prepared for market. 
Further studies are prescribed in which the entire process of manu- 
facture is entered upon, and also the method of preparing for market, 
transportation, and final distribution to the consumer. Such schools 
as these produce commercial directive power. It must be admitted, 
however, that the methods which the Germans have originated and 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
XXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  put into application have not yet been intelligently reported upon for 
the benefit of foreign nations. 
The study of civics.—In Chapter VII an account of the methods 
adopted in Switzerland and France to teach the youth of those two 
Republics the duties of citizenship is given. It seems that while the 
Swiss reserve this study for pupils of supplementary or continuation 
schools—that is to say, pupils in the seventh to the fourteenth years 
of the course of study—on the other hand the French attempt to intro- 
duce this material as a regular study into the elementary schools. 
The great fertility of the French mind in inventing devices for instrue- 
tion appears in the text-books and programmes of this course of civie 
study. Above all peoples the French understand how to make things 
talk. They can make objects instruct the youth automatically. 
They know best how to reduce the material of education to what I 
haye called a ‘‘pedagogic form.” Having settled upon the subject- 
matter which the pupil should learn, it is necessary to arrange this in 
such an order that the simplest comes first and that the earlier steps 
assist in the mastery of the later steps. It is very important, too, in 
obtaining the pedagogical form to insist on the arrangement of the 
matter in such a way that the first steps are valuable in and for them- 
selves if not followed by any later steps. It is a badly arranged 
course of study if some branches derive their entire usefulness from 
what is to succeed them. For the pupil in this case wastes all his time 
spent on these branches if he leaves school before arriving at the later 
steps which give value to the early steps. The teaching of mathe- 
matics and language has been so long in the course of development 
that its branches in the course of study have attained a nearly perfect 
pedagogical form. This is not yet the case in natural science and 
still less is it the case in the branches of industrial training. / But the 
wise teacher will do well to study carefully the methods enone in 
_ a the French schools in order to find the best yet attained in pedagog- 
. ieal form.} 
| Education in Greece.—In Chapter VIII a valuable paper is sub- 
mitted on education in Greece. <A brief sketch is given of the ¢iv- 
ilization of the Greeks, particularly of the Ionian branch. Greece 
continues to be of interest to the world because of the fact that it has 
furnished one of the three great contributions to civilization. The 
scientific turn of mind and the forms of art and literature all come 
from Greece, while the forms of law which enumerate the rights of 
person and property come from Rome. The view. of the world which | 
forms the deepest and most influential element in our civilization 
comes from Judea. The study of Greek art and literature looks for 
its illustrations to the ancient Grecian home in the present age even 
more than it has done in preceding centuries. One investigator, 
Schliemann, has wrought a considerable change in the method of 
classic study. The results of archeology, as pursued in Germany 
from the time of Winckelmann to the present, have wrought as great
-P-A-G-E-23

  a change in another part of classical study. The modern Greek, 
whether a lineal descendant or a descendant by adoption from the 
ancient Greek, can not choose but share in the warm interest of all 
western peoples who participate in the heritage of culture which 
comes to them from ancient Greece. 
Sunday schools.—In Chapter IX is to be found an elaborate article 
on the subject of the Sunday school. While the education of the 
American people supported by taxes and public funds is becoming 
more and more rigidly secular in character and the lines drawn more 
closely which separate it from ecclesiastical and religious instruction, 
yet the true importance of religious instruction is coming to be better 
understood among scientific and philosophical thinkers. The secular 
institutions of man are organized as the family, civil society and 
the state. These provide for education, the procurement of the neces- 
sities of life, and the establishment of justice. But all of these pre- 
suppose a deeper ground in the ideal of the origin and destiny of 
man and nature. They involve a world view, and religion furnishes 
and must furnish a world view. Hence all people, whether connected 
with one or another denomination of Christians, or whether holding a 
religion other than Christian or holding no conscious religion at all, 
must admit the importance of the religious instruction of the commu- 
nity. More than anything else the Sunday school has contributed to 
the sustenance of the church. 
With the spectacle of the systematic organization of the secular 
schools and the improvement of methods of teaching before them, 
the leaders in the church have endeavored to perfect the methods of 
the religious instruction of youth. They have met the following 
dangers which lay in their path, namely: First, the danger of adopting 
methods of instruction in religion which were fit and proper only for 
secular instruction; secondly, the selection of religious matter for 
the course of study which did not lead in a most direct manner 
toward vital religion, although it would readily take on a pedagogic 
form. 
The secular school gives positive instruction. It teaches mathe- 
matics, natural science, history, and language. Knowledge of the 
facts can be precise and accurate, and a similar knowledge of the 
principles ean be arrived at. The self-activity of the pupil is before 
all things demanded by the teacher of the secular school. The pupil 
must not take things on authority, but must test and verify what he 
has been told by his own activity. He must trace out the mathemati- 
cal demonstrations and see their necessity. He must learn the method 
of investigating facts in the several provinces of science and history. 
The spirit of the secular school therefore comes to be an enlightening 
one, although not of the highest order. But its enlightenment tends 
to make trust in authority more and more difficult for the young 
mind. 
On the other hand religion, which gives the net result of the wisdom
-P-A-G-E-24
XXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  of the race in the form of authority, omits and must omit the long 
lines of proof which have established it. The experience of thou- 
sands of years shrinks to a mere point, and is stated in the dogmas 
which seem to be immediate spiritual facts resting on external 
authority, the substructures of thousands of years being almost 
entirely concealed. Not only are these long periods of experience 
kept out of sight, but also the vast labors of religious thinkers who- 
have grappled with psychology and philosophy and assisted in mak- 
ing the religious results systematic and without contradiction. Reli- 
gious education, it is obvious, in giving the highest results of thought 
and life to the young, must cling to the form of authority, and not 
attempt to borrow the methods of mathematics, science, and history 
from the secular school. Such borrowing will result only in giving 
the young people an overweening confidence in the finality of their 
own immature judgments. They will become conceited and shallow- 
minded. It is well that the child should trust his own intellect in 
dealing with the multiplication table and the rule of three. It is well 
that he should learn the rules and all the exceptions in Latin syntax 
and verify them in the classic authors, but he must not be permitted 
to summon before him the dogmas of religion and form pert conclu- 
sions regarding their rationality. 
Against this danger of sapping or undermining all authority in reli- 
gion by the introduction of the methods of the secular school which 
lay all stress on the self-activity of the child, the Sunday school has 
not been sufficiently protected in the more recent years of its history. 
Large numbers of religious teachers, most intelligent and zealous in 
their piety, seek a more and more perfect adoption of the secular 
school methods. 
On the other hand, the topics of religious instruction have been 
determined largely by the necessities of the secular school method. 
That method is not adapted to teach mystic truth. It seeks every- 
where definite and especially mathematical results. But these 
results, although they are found everywhere in science and mathe- 
matics, are the farthest possible from being like the subject-matter of 
religion. Hence it has happened that in improving the methods of 
the Sunday school greater and greater attention has been paid to the 
history and geography of the Old Testament and less and less to the 
doctrinal matters of the New Testament. In Chapter IX the spe- 
cialist has brought together a great amount of material relating to 
the statisties of the Sunday schools and also to the methods of 
instruction. The statistics given, although not of the precise char- 
acter which can be obtained regarding secular instruction, are yet 
nearly enough accurate for all purposes. 
Land-grant colleges.—Chapter X is practically a symposium upon 
the important question, ‘‘ What shall the land-grant colleges teach?” 
In November, 1894, a committee of the Association of American

preparation such colleges should demand from applicants for admis- 
sion. The committee, while urging the necessity of establishing a 
standard that each college should maintain in order to protect the 
value of the degrees the land-grant colleges confer, recognized that 
some colleges are not in a position to do more than make a beginning 
toward attaining to the standard which the committee deemed desir- 
able should be eventually established. The papers by Presidents 
Stubbs, White, and Murkland, and by Director Jordan form an inter- 
esting and valuable discussion of the matters which should be taught 
in the land-grant colleges, and the pedagogical spirit which should 
animate those who are conducting them. 
Colleges and universities—Entrance examinations.—The require- 
ments for admission to the freshman class of the various courses of 
study in 475 universities, colleges, and schools of technology are given 
in Chapter XI. An examination of the requirements of the several 
institutions and of the summarized statements preceding the detailed 
table will show that there is at present a great diversity in such 
requirements, ranging from a knowledge of reading, writing, spelling, 
arithmetic, geography,and history up tothe requirements demanded by 
Harvard University. Various organizations throughout the country 
are at present engaged in a movement for the adoption of uniform 
entrance requirements. Short accounts of some of these organiza- 
tions and what has been accomplished by them in this direction are 
also given in this chapter. Attention is especially directed to the 
work of the Commission of Colleges in New England on Admission 
Examinations, which has been engaged on this subject since 1886. 
~~ The right of the State to educate.—In Chapter XII will be found a 
number of decisions by the higher courts of the several States con- 
firming the right of society to educate the citizens of the next gener- 
ation. It would appear that the courts of law have maintained that 
it is the right and duty of the legislature to care for the public intel- 
ligence as well as for the public health and security, and have fur- 
ther regarded itas a constitutional requirement to refuse to recognize 
any efforts which tend to establishing two or more antagonistic socie- 
ties within the same State. 
Educational psychology.—Chapter XIII continues the survey of 
psychological movements maintained in previous reports. The sub- 
ject is considered in its relation to education and especially as fos- 
tered in this country by school officials and teachers. 
Under the impulse imparted by Professor Royce, of Harvard, and 
Professor Baldwin, of Princeton, imitation has oceupied the atten- 
tion of many groups of investigators. A summary of opinions and 
of data relating to this topic is presented in the chapter followed by 
a report on the ‘‘Imitative functions in childhood as related to the 
process of learning” from the committee on psychological inquiry of

Gen. Francis A. Walker.—The educational profession in the 
United States has lost one of its most distinguished members in the 
person of Gen. Francis A. Walker. His public services to the nation 
as soldier and as head of the Federal Census Bureau, his labors in 
the International Statistical Society, over which he presided at its 
meeting in Chicago in 1893, his many writings upon those topics in 
education that deal with its pathology—these labors had made him 
known throughout the world of seience and education. To the 
pathology of education he had contributed most thoughtful sugges- 
tions regarding the influence of manual training, and studies upon 
the methods of curing arrested development in peculiar cases of 
backward pupils, or pupils who had gained the reputation for dull- 
ness or obtusity in mind. Extracts from some of these papers giving 
his point of view as to the relation of manual training to certain 
mental defects, the place of college athletics, the extension of tech- 
nical training, are found at the close of Chapter XIV. 
It is hoped that these and other similar papers of General Walker 
will be collected in a volume by themselves, inasmuch as such a vol- 
ume would take its place at once in the most select list of educational 
classics. 
Report of the Committee of Twelve on rural schools.—During the past 
five years three remarkable committees have been appointed through 
the agency of the National Educational Association and a considera-, 
ble sum of money placed at the disposal of each to conduct investiga- 
tions and provide for conference meetings of the committee. First, 
there was the Report of the Committee of Ten, under the chairman- 
ship of President Eliot, of Harvard College, which discussed the ques- 
tion of the course of study in preparatory schools, laying down certain 
programmes for secondary schools engaged in the work of fitting stu- 
dents for the college or the school of technology. This report was 
enriched by the contributions from nine subcommittees, representing 
the labors of ninety experts. The second national committee, known 
by the name of the Committee of Fifteen, discussed methods of organ- 
ization and supervision of city school systems, the normal school prep- 
aration of teachers for the elementary schools, and the course of study 
at present existing in the elementary schools, together with suggestions 
for its modification. 
The third national committee, called the Committee of Twelve on 
Rural Schools, published the results of its two years’ labors in June, 
1897. To this report there were nineteen valuable appendices. The 
entire report without appendices is to be found in Chapter XVII.

Engineering schools, entrance examinations to engineering colleges. — 
In Chapter XI the entrance examinations to the academic departments 
of the several colleges and universities of the United States are given. 
In Chapter XVIII are found the entrance requirements to engineering 
colleges. 
Early history of the kindergarten in St. Lowis, Mo.—Chapter XIX 
contains a reprint from the Annual Report of the St. Louis Public 
Schools, 1878-79, of a discussion of the philosophy of the kinder- 
garten, and also a history of the adoption and growth of the kinder- 
garten system in that city, together with quotations from the lectures 
of Miss Susan E. Blow on ‘‘The gifts and occupations of Froebel.” 
Contributions to the curriculum of the land-grant colleges.—The 
remarkable discoveries in biology which have characterized the last 
half of this century have completely revolutionized the ideas con- 
cerning vegetable nutrition and instinct. In Chapter XX certain 
facts which illustrate the discussions in the higher classes of colleges 
of agriculture are collated, especially with the view of showing the 
source of fertility in agricultural work and the economic value of 
cooperation in agricultural communities. The chapter also contains 
much data regarding the progress recently made in metallurgy and 
in mining operations. 
Tennessee Centennial Haxposition.—The agent in charge of the 
exhibit of the Bureau of Education at the Tennessee Centennial 
Exposition, held at Nashville in the summer of 1897, makes a report 
on the Exposition, and, in view of the educational importance of the 
Exposition, and especially of one of its features, the reproduction of 
the Parthenon! of the Acropolis at Athens, in the full dimensions of 
the original, devotes considerable space to the history and significance 
of this work of art. At present more and more attention is being 
given in the schools of civilized peoples to the training of pupils in 
esthetic taste. Those nations, other things being equal, are the 
richest that give their goods a beautiful finish and that introduce 
tasteful ornamentation. This accounts largely for the first rank held 
by France and Great Britain in the markets of the world. 
Nothing else has been found so important in training the taste of 
youth as a study of the motives and composition of the Greek works 
of art. Greek art has made the presentation of gracefulness its chief 
aim. Gracefulness is the summit of the beautiful. Romantic or 
Christian art is rather a transition from art to a higher province, 
namely, that of religion, but its products are for this reason less emi- 
nent as works of art. 
The Greek religion made beauty the essential feature of the idea of

  XXVUI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  the divine, and hence the art of Greece is intended as.an act of worship 
of the beautiful. It represents the supreme attainment of the world 
in pure beauty, because it is pure beauty and nothing beyond. 
Christianity reaches beyond beauty to holiness. Other heathen reli- 
gions fall short of the Greek ideal and lack an essential element 
which the Greek religion possessed. The Greeks believed that the 
divine is at the same time human, and human not in the sense that 
the essence of man, his purified intellect and will, is divine, but 
human in the corporeal sense. The gods of Olympus possess appe- 
tites and passions like men; they have bodies and live in a special 
place. They form a society or large patriarchal family. The mani- 
festation of the divine is celestial beauty. Moreover, the human 
being may by becoming beautiful become divine. Hence the Greek 
religion centers about gymnastic games. These are the Olympian, 
the Isthmian, the Nemean, and the Pythian games. Exercises that 
shall give the soul sovereignty over the body and develop it into 
beauty are religious in this sense. Every village had its games for 
physicaldevelopment. These were attended by the people, who became 
in time judges of perfection in human form, just as a community that 
attends frequent horse races produces men that know critically the 
good points of a horse. It was known who was the best man at wres- 
tling, boxing, throwing the discus, the spear, or javelin; at running, 
at leaping, or at the chariot or horseback races. Then at less fre- 
_ quent intervals there was the contest at games between neighboring 
villages. The successful hero carried off the crown of wild olive 
branches. Nearly every year there was a great national assembly of 
Greeks, and a contest open toall. The Olympian festival at Olympia 
and the Isthmian festival near Corinth were held the same summer; 
then at Argolis, in the winter of the second year afterwards, was the 
Nemean festival; then the Pythian festival near Delphi, and a second 
Isthmian festival occurred in the spring of the third year; and again 
there was a second Nemean festival in the summer of the fourth year 
of the Olympiad. The entire people, composed of independent states, 
united by ties of religion, assembled to celebrate this faith in the 
beautiful and honor their successful youth. The results carried the 
national taste for the beautiful as seen in the human body to the 
highest degree. 
The next step after the development of the personal work of art in 
the shape of beautiful youth, by means of the national games and 
the cultivation of the taste of the entire people through the spectacle 
of these games, was the art of sculpture, by which these forms of 
beauty, realized in the athletes and existing in the minds of the 
people as ideals of correct taste, were fixed in stone and set up in the 
temples for worship. Thus Greek art was born. The statues at first 
were of gods and demigods exclusively. Those which have come 
down to us cause our unbounded astonishment at their perfection of
-P-A-G-E-29
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION, XXIX 
form. It is not their resemblance to living bodies, not their anatomi- 
eal exactness, that interests us, not their so-called ‘‘truth to nature,” 
but their gracefulness and serenity—their ‘‘ classic repose.” Whether 
the statues represent gods and heroes in action or in sitting and 
reclining postures, there is this ‘‘repose,” which means indwelling 
vital activity, and not mere rest as opposed to movement. In the 
greatest activity there is considerate purpose and perfect self-control 
manifested. The repose is of the soul, and not a physical repose. 
Even sitting and reclining figures—for example, the Theseus from the 
Parthenon, the torso of the Belvedere—are filled with activity, so 
that the repose is one of voluntary self-restraint and not the repose 
of the absence of vital energy. They are gracefulness itself. 
The bearing of exhibits of Greek art on American industrial edu- 
cation is obvious. 
One will concede at the start that tool work is valuable as indus- 
trial training, and that especially is this the case with the course of 
study and work in the manual-training school, because it teaches how 
to manufacture tools and machines of all kinds, and thereby gives the 
laborer that command over the instruments of industry which assists 
him very much in his struggle for excellence in the fields of labor. 
Still more valuable must we regard the study of natural science, 
and especially of applied mathematics, in the laws of matter and 
motion. It furnishes the theory of all machinery and of all produc- 
tion of supplies from nature. 
Besides this, we may claim that general education is of the utmost 
importance, opening as it does the powers of thought and observation, 
giving each laborer an insight into human nature and fitting him for 
logical thinking on all subjects; fitting him alike to lead others and 
combine them in extensive undertakings, and likewise to serve faith- 
fully and intelligently other leaders when the case requires. This 
general education is indeed indispensable to the citizen and to the best 
quality of industrial laborers. 
But esthetic education—the cultivation of taste, the acquirement 
of knowledge on the subject’of the origin of the idea of beauty (both 
its historic origin and the philosophical account of its source in human 
nature), the practice of producing the outlines of the beautiful by 
the arts of drawing, painting, and modeling, the criticism of works 
of art with a view to discover readily the causes of failure or of suc- 
cess in esthetic effects—all these things, we must claim, form the 
true foundation of the highest success in the industries of any modern 
nation. The dynamic side is needed; but invention of the useful 
does not succeed in controlling the markets of the world. A nation 
with its laborers all educated in their taste for beautiful forms will 
give graceful shapes to their productions, and command higher prices 
forthem. The graceful shape and the proper ornamentation charm 
the purchaser, and he willingly pays a higher price for the article of

usefulness if it is made by an artist than if it is made by a mere 
artisan. 
Sweden is the leader in the manual-training movement, but her 
educators did not at first see the importance of developing correct 
taste among her laborers as a condition of industrial success. Accord- 
ingly, while ingenuity was increasing to some extent in that country, 
there was no improvement in the artistic finish and ornamentation of 
their goods. Other nations did not want ugly shapes in sight, and did 
not buy them. -To have ugly utensils perpetually in view gradually 
works degeneration in one’s taste. The figures of the commercial 
reports of that early day showed that we imported raw materials from 
Sweden, but did not buy their manufactures. In the official report 
of commerce and navigation of the United States for 1881 the imports 
from Sweden and Norway are reported as pig iron, $111,176; bar iron, 
$517,959; old and scrap iron, $114,883; total, $744,018. But of manu- 
factures of iron and steel only $111,749 were reported. It is surpris- 
ing to note that at that time we imported wood manufactures from 
them only to the small amount of $137, while we imported rags for 
paper manufacture to the amount of $39,090—but no manufactured 
clothing to speak of. The same year Belgium sent us wood manufac- 
tures to the value of $118,146, or nearly one thousand times the value 
of the same item from Sweden and Norway. 
In 1851, at the World’s Exposition in London, it became evident 
that English industries were not of such a character as to compete 
with those of France and Belgium. Prince Albert, always wise 
and thoughtful, set about a deep-reaching system of education that 
should correct the national defect and recover the prestige of British 
arts and manufactures. The South Kensington Museum was estab- 
lished, and day and evening art schools set up in all manufacturing 
centers. The museum placed at its foundation a collection of works 
showing the history of art, its beginnings, its high-water marks, 
and its fluctuations. On this basis instruction was given in those 
forms of ornamentation that the world has pronounced beautiful. 
There began from this time a gradual rise in the taste of the English 
workman; from being an artisan pure and simple he began to be an 
artist. England has gone forward rapidly in the direction of producing 
works of taste, and her useful manufactures, heretofore made without 
much reference to beauty, have steadily improved in tastefulness of 
design and execution. 
The establishment of a great national art gallery, the Louvre, and 
the studies of French savants in the canons of good taste, had long 
before revolutionized French manufactures, and given France the 
supremacy in the world-market for goods that command high prices 
and ready sale. 
Taking hint from England, we have had in this country something 
of a fever for education in art, especially in the lines of industrial 
drawing. Remarkable as has been our progress in the matter, yet

FEDERAL AID TO EDUCATION. XXXI 
there is a prevalent lack of insight into the true direction and sig- 
nificance of this branch. 
Federal. aid to education.—The Federal Government, the several 
State governments, the churches, private beneficence, and business 
enterprise have all furnished important agencies in founding the 
several parts of the educational system of the country. Some years 
since this Bureau published a Cireular of Information presenting 
the history of Federal and State aid to higher education in the United 
States.! 
This cireular of Dr. Blackmar has been out of print for some 
time. In view of the demand for information as to State and national 
aid to education, Chapter XXTII in the present report has been com- 
piled, giving, in a condensed form, the amount of Federal and State 
aid for the establishment of higher education. This chapter requires 
to be supplemented by another, in which an attempt should be made 
to analyze the amounts reported to this Bureau since 1870 in such a 
way as to admit of a compilation showing the amount actually fur- 
nished from the State treasury for maintaining institutions for higher 
education considered apart from the income derived from the amounts 
given by the Federal and State governments for establishing higher 
education in the United States. 
From the first grant to Tennessee, on its admission in 1796, up to 
the admission of the Dakotas, Montana, and Washington, Congress 
had granted about 20,000 square miles of lands to the several States 
specifically for the purpose of universities, or, as it was sometimes 
said, ‘‘seminaries of learning.” Since 1889 not quite 3,260 square 
miles have been granted and the price fixed at $6,400 a square mile. 
The grants of land made previously to 1889 were either given by or 
followed as a precedent one of two acts, the first of which was an 
appendage to the ordinance of 1787 and the other the act of March 2, 
1862. By the first of these acts, that of 1787, and its successor, about 
20,000 square miles had been given and had been sold up to 1889 
for $2,600 a square mile, on the average, in the aggregate amounting 
to $5,000,000. By the act of 1862 the States received 15,000 square 
miles, which they sold, on the average, for $704 a square mile—that is 
to say, they realized about $10,500,000. The matter may be stated in 
the following form:

  XXXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
It is not possible at this date to state with the same general accuracy 
the amount that has been given by the States to establish higher edu- 
cation. But if we take what the institutions, aided by them, have 
accumulated in the way of value of buildings and apparatus it will 
give some idea of the aid afforded. The buildings and apparatus of 
these institutions (colleges and universities) amounted to $41,000,000 
in 1896, about the same as Professor Blackmar gives for all the colleges 
and universities (345) in the United States ten years ago. The endow- 
ment of these institutions (‘“‘productive funds”) is $51,673;000, but 
$30,000,000 of this belongs to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell. 
In the chapter referred to above an itemized statement is given for 
each State. Professor Blackmar gives the endowment of all the col- 
leges and universities in the United States in 1886 as $49,700,000. 
Governmental control of learned professions.—The present year is 
noteworthy in the history of the medical and allied professions for the 
concerted action of European and some American governments in 
fixing standards for practice in the professions of dental and other 
surgery, and also in medicine in general. In Chapter XXV important 
data are brought together showing the progress made in the United 
States in this matter. 
Eskimo vocabulary.—Chapter XXVII, Volume 2, is a reprint of 
“English-Eskimo and Eskimo-English Vocabularies,” originally pre- 
pared by Mr. John W. Kelly, in charge of the whaling station at Point 
Barrow, and published by this office as a Circular of Information 
in 1890, now out of print. These vocabularies are probably the most 
complete that have been compiled, and are of especial value at the 
present time owing to the extraordinary impetus given to immigra- 
tion into Alaska by the gold discoveries in that section. 
Early education in North Carolina.—The beginning of the common 
school system in the South is traced in Chapter XXIX. To North 
Carolina belongs the honor of having been first of the fourteen South- 
ern States east of the Mississippi to evolve a working system of com- 
mon schools. This State is also conspicuous for the advanced position 
it occupied in matters of education in the constitution adopted in 
1776, in the early chartering and opening of its State University, in 
the breadth of the educational thought shown by Archibald D. Mur- 
phey, the father of her common schools, and in the administrative 
ability of Rev. Calvin H. Wiley, her first general superintendent. 
This State, too, was alone among the Confederate States in keeping 
open her schools during the war. The gradual growth and develop- 
ment of her public system from its beginning in the report of Judge 
Murphey in 1817 and in the formation of the Literary Fund of 1825, 
are traced up to and through the war. As the success of this system 
was due very largely to the work of one man, the study has taken to 
a certain extent the form of a biography. 
Geographical instruction in central Hwrope.—The report of this
-P-A-G-E-33
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. XXXII 
office for 1892-93 (Volume 1, pp. 279-321) includes a chapter on the 
teaching of geography in Central Europe. 
The subject is continued in Chapter XX XV, Volume 2 of the pres- 
ent report with special reference to Great Britain and France. For 
purposes of comparison, the matter is introduced by a brief epitome 
of a report on the subject by Dr. J. Scott Keltie, made to the council 
of the Royal Geographical Society in 1885. 
Since that date, and partly as a result of the report, the study has 
received marked development in the countries considered, but their 
relative position in respect to it is practically the same. Germany 
still leads in the matter, although in respect to teaching appliances 
and to the development of the higher phases of geographical instruc- 
tion, France is second to no country. Advance is noted in Great 
Britain, but not sufficient to bring her schools to the level of the con- 
tinental schools in this respect. 
Following the consideration of Dr. Keltie’s report is an epitome of 
a recent report by M. Levasseur, the eminent statistician of France, 
upon the treatment of geography in the elementary and secondary 
schools and the universities of his own country. Reference is also 
made to the development of the subject in the Australian provinces 
and especially to the efforts of Mr. J. P. Thomson, of Brisbane, Queens- 
land, to promote the study of geography, and by his researches and 
publications to increase the knowledge of the subject. 
Consular reports on education.—Through the courtesy of the hon- 
orable the Secretary of State this Bureau has received many consular 
reports containing valuable information regarding education in for- 
eign countries. Some extracts from these reports are collected in 
Chapter XX XI. 
Education in Hawati.—In Chapter XXXII the most recent infor- 
mation concerning education in Hawaii is furnished by General Eaton, 
former Commissioner of this Bureau. 
Anthropology in child study.—Chapter XXXIV, Volume 2, con- 
tains an account of the growth of Toronto children, prepared by Rrof. 
Franz Boas, of the American Museum of Natural History in New 
York. This paper represents the results of minute investigations on 
the school children of the city of Toronto, Canada, and the scientific 
treatment of the results obtained. Previously similar investigations 
at other places aimed at finding the influence of sex, occupation of 
parents, and descent; Professor Boas selected the influence of the 
order of birth, i. e., the question if first-born children have a develop- 
ment different from that of later-born children. The method of 
treating the results of such observations has largely been a compar- 
ison of averages and of the frequency of occurrence of averages 
between certain limits. The professor’s account will be welcomed by 
anthropologists as a contribution to their special science. 
Higher education.—The school year 1896-97 witnessed the suspen-

sion of twelve universities and colleges and the discontinuance of 
college work by three other institutions. This is recorded in Chapter 
XXXVI. The number of students pursuing liberal studies, that is, 
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate departments, was 
97,122, a decrease of 255 from the number reported in the preceding 
year. The number of such students reported by public institutions 
shows an increase of 1,358, thus proving that the decrease was in 
institutions not controlled by the States. The number of graduate 
students in attendance at our higher institutions is constantly increas- 
ing, the number of such students in 1896-97 having been 4,919, of 
which 1,413 were women. The total amount of money invested in 
universities, colleges, and schools of technology is $295,816,887. Of 
this amount $128,191,974 consists of endowment funds invested at an 
average rate of 4.8 per cent per annum. The benefactions to these 
institutions during the year amounted to $8,390,938. 
Professional schools.—In the 157 theological schools mentioned in 
Chapter XX XVIII, there were 8,173 students, an increase of 156 over 
the number the previous year. 
In the 77 law schools there were 10,449 students, of whom 3,106 
were graduated during the year. As the number of law students in 
1890 was 4,518, we see that the number was more than doubled in 
seven years, while the number of theological students increased by 
about one-eighth only in that period of time. 
Medical students numbered 24,377, of whom 21,438 were enrolled 
in the regular schools of medicine, 2,038 in homeopathic schools, 
789 in eclectic, and 112 in physiomedical. The number of students 
graduating in medicine during the year was 5,564. By comparing 
the ratio of graduates in medicine to the whole number of medical 
students with the ratio of graduates in law, it will be seen that much 
less time is required for completion of a course in law than in 
medicine. 
The 48 dental schools had an attendance of 6,460 students, and the 
number of graduates was 1,640. Students of pharmacy numbered 
3,426, a slight decrease from the previous year. 
Normal schools.—For the school year 1896-97 there were in the 
various institutions reporting to this office 89,934 normal students, or 
students pursuing courses designed for the professional training of 
teachers, as shown in Chapter XXXIX. This was an increase of 
5,534 over the previous year. These normal students were distributed 
as follows: In public normal schools, 43,199; in private normal 
schools, 24,181; in universities and colleges, 6,489; in public high 
schools, 9,001; in private high schools and academies, 7,064. The 
students here included are those who were actually pursuing teachers’ 
training courses in these various institutions. Students in public and 
private normal schools pursuing other courses of study are accounted 
for in the chapter on Normal Schools, Volume 2. The 89,934 normal
-P-A-G-E-35

students were distributed among 1,487 institutions; 164 public normal 
schools, 198 private normal schools, 196 institutions of collegiate 
grade, 507 public high schools, and 422 private high schools and acad- 
emies. The public normal schools had more than 48 per cent of the 
normal students, or an average of 263 students to the institution. 
The average number of normal students to the private normal school 
was 122. The 196 colleges and universities reporting had an average 
of 33 normal students to the institution. The public and private 
high schools reporting had an average of 18 and 17 normal students, 
respectively. It is gratifying to note a steady growth in the State 
appropriations for the support of public normal schools. The aggre- 
gate amount appropriated by States, cities, and counties for the sup- 
port of public normal schools was $2,426,185, an increase of $238,310 
over the previous year. This aggregate of nearly two and a half 
millions was a sum larger than ever before received by the public nor- 
malschools for the running expenses of one year. It does not include 
$743,333 appropriated for buildings and improvements. 
Secondary schools.—For the scholastic year 1896-97 there were, as 
shown in Chapter XL, 5,109 publie high schools reporting to this 
office, a gain of 135 over the previous year. The total number of 
secondary students in these high schools was 409,433, a gain of 28,940. 
The male students numbered 173,445, a gain of 15,503, and the female 
students 235,988, a gain of 13,437 over the year before. The number 
of graduates was 50,042, a gain of 4,178. The students in the grad- 
uating class who had completed a college preparatory course and who 
had expressed their intention of going to college numbered 14,641, a 
gain of 1,213 over the previous year. 
The number of private high schools, academies and other institu- 
tions of secondary grade reporting for the year 1896-97 was 2,100, 
only 6 less than the previous year. The number of secondary stu- 
dents reported was 107,633, a gain of 979. There were 53,218 male 
students, a loss of 273, and 54,415 female students, a gain of 1,252 
over the previous year. The number of graduates was 11,772, a gain 
of 483. The number of graduates prepared for college was 5,511, a 
gain of 256. 
Combining the statistics of public and private secondary schools it 
is found that there were 7,209 schools of this grade in operation in 
the United States for the school year 1896-97. It is believed that 
nearly all the institutions which can be properly classed as secondary 
schools are now on the lists of this Bureau. The number of teachers 
in these public and private secondary schools engaged in instructing 
secondary students was 26,383, a gain of 1,931 over the previous year. 
The number of secondary students was 517,066, a gain of 29,919. 
There were 61,814 graduates, a gain of 4,661. The number of grad- 
uates prepared for college was 20,152, a gain of 1,469 over the pre- 
vious year.

  XXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
If there be added to the 517,066 secondary students in publie and 
private high schools and academies, the 51,690 secondary students in 
the preparatory departments of institutions of collegiate grade, the 
12,730 secondary students in public and private normal schools, not 
normal students, and the 3,418 secondary students in manual-training 
schools, the grand total of secondary students in the United States 
reported to this Bureau is 584,904. It is a well known fact that there 
are in the elementary schools of nearly all the States many students 
pursuing secondary studies because high schools are not accessible. 
Could these scattering students be enumerated it is not improbable 
that the aggregate of secondary students would reach a figure con- 
siderably above 600,000. 
Education in Alaska.—During the past two years by reason of the 
numerous discoveries of gold in Alaska that Territory has become an 
object of great interest. A school established at Circle City, on the 
upper Yukon, near the boundary between United States and British 
America, had a successful session during its first year, but on account 
of the removal of the inhabitants from Circle City to the region of the 
Klondike has lost nearly all of its pupils and has been closed for the 
present year. Large numbers of immigrants collected with their fami- 
lies at Dyea and Skagway seemed to demand accommodations for their 
children in school, but the present state of rapid change, not only of 
routes but of mining localities at the ends of those routes, makes it 
uncertain whether a school established for the children of the families 
of miners could have a longer term of existence than the one at Circle 
City, which seemed two years ago likely to become a permanent cen- 
ter for mining operations. 
The missionaries representing the great bodies of Christian faith 
have thus far selected what may be called the strategical points for 
influence upon the native population of Alaska. 
From the beginning, in 1885-86 on to 1893-94, it had been the policy 
of the Bureau of Education to subsidize mission schools in all places 
where it was not possible to establish Government day schools. The 
population of Indian villages is more or less nomadic, summering in 
camps on the seas and rivers at good fishing places, and wintering in 
their villages, located in more sheltered situations. The arrival of 
white immigrants has given a fixed character to these villages, in the 
southeast part of Alaska especially. In the southeastern region, in 
the presence of a larger or smaller contingent of white population, it 
has been found possible to establish Government schools and organize 
local school committees to supervise them. But in northern and west- 
ern Alaska, villages with a nucleus of white population are not to 
be found, except at the ports of Unalaska and St. Michael; and in 
order to reach the natives successfully, it is necessary to avail one’s 
self of the mission stations, 3 of which are located on the Arctic 
Ocean, 9 on the Bering Sea, and 7 in the river valley of the Yukon,
-P-A-G-E-37
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. XXXVII 
making a total of 19 missions with 61 missionaries. These mission 
stations have been located, in the light of a great deal of experience, 
at such places as furnish natural centers for the native population 
and at the saine time afford the best facilities for communication with 
the United States in the short summer season. For the long winter 
season of eight to nine months no communication has been possible 
hitherto with northwestern Alaska. 
In subsidizing the mission schools a certain minimum of school 
enrollment has been required, and a certain sum per pupil allowed, 
not to exceed in the aggregate a fixed sum agreed upon. The example 
of the Indian Bureau has been closely followed in this matter, except 
that where the Indian Bureau has allowed subsidies of $167 per annum 
this Bureau has allowed from $90 to $150 per pupil, boarded, clothed, 
and instructed, and $30 for day pupils. The maximum amount paid 
to contract schools appears in the year 1889-90, when the sum of 
$31,174.12 was paid. The largest item of that year was paid for indus- 
trial instruction and apparatus necessary to facilitate the same. In 
the year 1892-93 the action of Congress with regard to the Indian 
Bureau in the matter of contract schools was taken as indicating a 
policy to withdraw appropriations from contract schools, and for that 
reason the amount paid to contract schools in that year was reduced 
from $28,980 to $17,040—almost 40 per cent, and in 1893-94 it was 
further reduced to $8,000. In the year 1894-95 the subsidizing of 
contract schools was entirely discontinued, but in a few cases Govern- 
ment teachers were assigned to the mission stations. 
The mission stations not only have the advantage of being located 
in important centers of the native population in the north and west, 
but they bring with them certain other advantages which the Govern- 
ment may use for its purposes of instructing the natives in the English 
language and in the arts of civilized life. In the first place, the mis- 
sion station is a very effective center for the spread of the use of the 
English language among the natives, educating not only the children 
who come to its schools, but also the adult population attending its 
religious services or coming into any business relation with it what-, 
ever. I have already mentioned that there are 19 missionary centers 
and a corps of 61 missionaries in northwestern and central Alaska 
extending daily this educational influence to entire communities of 
Indians or Eskimos. 
In 1885 General Eaton, as Commissioner of Education, secured the 
services of Dr. Sheldon Jackson as general agent for education in 
Alaska, which had recently been placed under the charge of the Sec- 
retary of the Interior. Dr. Jackson had been appointed superintend- 
ent of home missions for several States and Territories in the North- 
west as early as 1869, and had distinguished himself by the vigor 
with which he extended the work in the far west. In 1870 he took 
charge of the work of home missions in the vast region from Mexico  
-P-A-G-E-38

  to Canada and from Nevada to Nebraska. In the early days before 
railroads had penetrated those regions he traveled on foot or used 
ox earts or mustang ponies. In the prosecution of his work he 
traveled in thirteen years 345,027 miles, or an average of 26,540 miles 
ayear. He established and for ten years conducted the ‘‘Rocky Moun- 
tain Presbyterian.” In 1877 he visited Alaska as the first ordained 
missionary from the United States, and in the next eight years he rap- 
idly established schools and churches in the archipelago, and com- 
menced the process of civilization which has gone on in Alaska ever 
since. In 1880 he built the church and founded the Industrial Train- 
ing School for native children at Sitka. 
After his appointment as United States agent his trips to the north- 
west were undertaken for the most part in the Bear, a revenue cut- 
ter sent out annually by the Secretary of the Treasury. Its captain 
(M. A. Healy) interested himself warmly in the cause represented by 
Dr. Jackson in this region, and to him is due in a measure the suc- 
cess in establishing schools in northwest Alaska. And to him and 
Dr. Jackson is due the original suggestion of the plan of stocking 
the enormous moss fields of Alaska with herds of reindeer and the 
training of the natives into skilled herdsmen and teamsters. 
Ti had been obvious, from the beginning of the Government sub- 
sidies in 1885-86, that there should be not only education in elemen- 
tary English branches, but also a training in the employments of 
civilized life. From the first, at all the missions there was instruction 
in cooking, housekeeping, and clothes making. Then followed more 
careful education in the trades of carpentering, blacksmithing, and 
shoemaking, subsidizing for this instruction the Presbyterian Indus- 
trial School at Sitka. As early as 1891 the matter of the introduction 
of reindeer into Alaska had been brought to my attention by Dr. 
Sheldon Jackson and Captain Healy, of the United States revenue 
cutter Bear. Upon learning that tame reindeer could be obtained 
from points in Siberia opposite to Alaska, and that all of Alaska 
(excepting the river valleys and places on the coast covered with 
_ forests) bore large quantities of the kind of moss that furnishes the 
best food for the reindeer, I became so much interested in the project 
of introducing the reindeer into northwestern Alaska that I urged 
Dr. Jackson to appeal to the friends of missionary education for a 
preliminary sum to begin the experiment at once. From the sum of 
$2,156 thus procured a first purchase of 16 deer was made in the 
summer of 1891, and a herd of 171 in the summer of 1892. The 
Government appropriation of $6,000 became available for the sup- 
port of reindeer in the summer of 1893, and a further purchase of 124 
deer was made, and for the summer of 1894 a still further pur- 
chase of 123 was made out of an appropriation of $7,500, making a 
total of 538 deer purchased in Siberia and placed in a Government 
herd near Port.Clarence. The 16 deer purchased in 1891 have been
-P-A-G-E-39
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. XXXIX 
allowed to run wild on one of the eastern Aleutian Islands, and since 
then have in a measure stocked that island with reindeer. From this 
original herd of 538 reindeer a total number of 1,323 fawns have been 
born, making an aggregate of 1,861, of which 395 have been lost, 
injured, or killed in various ways during the five years, leaving 1,466 
reindeer in the herds August, 1897. 
A plan has been gradually matured for the use of these reindeer in 
the scheme of education. Two objects are to be secured: (1) The 
training of the natives as herders and as teamsters. This implies 
that the natives must be interested in the project; they must take the 
long step from nomadic fishermen and hunters to dwellers in villages, 
with permanent employments that will support them and also ren- 
der them useful to a white population which will eventually come 
to central and northwestern Alaska. (2) The other important object 
to be gained is the education of these natives in thrift, so that they 
will preserve and accumulate the reindeer intrusted to them. 
At each mission station there is constantly going on a process of 
selecting the trustworthy natives—those ambitious to learn the civili- 
zation of the white men, those ambitious to hold and increase prop- 
erty. Reindeer intrusted to the ordinary individual savage would 
disappear within twelve months after the gift. 
At the reindeer station a number of apprentices have been selected 
and rewards for intelligent and persevering industry offered. They 
were to receive two reindeer for the first year’s apprenticeship; at 
the end of the second year five more, in such a way as to gradually 
develop the sense of individual ownership of property—a sense which 
has never been developed in the tribal relation.

UnitED STATES REVENUE-MARINE STEAMER BEAR,

Simm: * * * The herders are tobe fed and clothed and housed, also furnished 
with tobacco or its equivalent, at Government expense. The Siberian herders and 
the experienced Eskimo, each one will receive, in addition to the above, $50 worth 
of barter goods at the end of the year and the inexperienced ones $30 worth. If 
they prefer it they can be paid a portion of the above from time to time as they 
may need it, only that at the end of the year the amount received shall not exceed 
the total amount allowed. 
When food is plenty and cheap you will purchase with the supplies at the station 
such oil, meat, dried fish, skins, etc., as are needed at the station. You are also 
authorized to purchase wood from the natives. 
In addition to the paid herders, it is desired that you take into the station a 
number of wide-awake young men to learn the management of deer. They will 
be fed, clothed, and housed at Government expense. If they have been faithful 
to their duties and have shown aptitude in learning for one full year at the station 
you are authorized to allow them two deer, which can be marked with their brand, 
but must be continued in the general herd. At the end of the second year you 
can givethem fivemore. I think it will be well to encourage them toremain with

XL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the herd for three or four years, when they will have sufficient deer, so that two 
or three of the herders, by combining their holdings, can start a new herd. 
If, after a fair trial of a few months, a young man is lazy, indifferent, or dull, 
you had better send him away from the station and give his place to a more prom- 
ising one. There is a constant sifting process going on among white men, and the 
same process is equally needful among the natives. 
I would like the first herders especially to be picked penetiiie ablest and best 
among their people—as that class willalone secure the best results from the intro- 
duction of the deer. 
  Under the regulations established 9 apprentices have received rein- 
deer—from 2 to 7 each. The total number of reindeer originally 
assigned to them being 52, the same had increased last August by the 
birth of fawns to 133. 
From the beginning, schoolbooks and apparatus have been fur- 
nished for the schools in Alaska. Reindeer are the schoolbooks and 
apparatus necessary for the education of the western and northern 
natives. To secure the chief object aimed at in the importation of 
reindeer from Siberia, it is evident that the reindeer must eventually 
come into the hands of thrifty persons among the natives, who will 
preserve the herds, increase them, break them to harness, and make 
them available, under the management of trained teamsters, for the 
use of white immigrants who settle in Alaska. The missionary sta- 
tions furnish the only safe centers for the location of herds and the 
establishment of schools of instruction in the rearing of the reindeer 
and in the training of them to harness. 
As already mentioned, the missions ascertain the capable and 
teachable youth among the natives. They are able at any time to 
furnish a list of the natives in their vicinities noted for good charac- 
ter. At each of these stations 20 or 30 youth, selected from a village 
population of 300 or more, can be put in training as herdsmen and 
teamsters. No matter how large the Government appropriation 
should be, therefore, it would be necessary to connect the reindeer 
instruction and the establishment of permanent herds in northwest 
Alaska with these missionary stations. 
The small herds loaned to each missionary station as a Govern- 
ment aid are in the nature of an outfit of industrial apparatus. The 
report of the Indian Bureau shows that the United States Govern- 
ment furnished 10,000 head of stock for the period of 1890-96 for one 
Indian agency (the Blackfeet), and that seeds, implements, stock, 
wagons, harness, in large amounts, have been furnished to other 
agencies. These donations are certainly more justifiable than dona- 
tions made to prevent the savage peoples from starving, for they are 
given in the form of apparatus for the instruction of these peoples 
in the industrial arts and in the practice of thrift. All these things 
prevent starvation. Just as in the agricultural colleges of the sev- 
eral States the Government money is used to pay for the stock of the 
model farm, which is used as the apparatus for the instruction of the
-P-A-G-E-41

pupils, so the reindeer herd is used as apparatus loaned to the mis- 
sionary stations for the purpose of instruction of the natives. But 
from three to five years’ apprenticeship is needed for the full training 
of apprentices in the management of reindeer. 
Persons who have been brought up to the care of neat cattle and 
horses, or sheep only, have not thereby acquired the art of managing 
reindeer, for this requires special apprenticeship. With the first 
herd (that of 1892) Siberian herdsmen were procured to give instruc- 
tion in these arts, but the degree of success was so small that in 1894 
five families of Laplanders were obtained to take their place. The 
Laplanders, being a civilized people and devoid of the superstitions 
which embarrass the Siberian natives, have attained a higher degree 
of skill in the management of this animal, and also show greater 
ability in teaching others what they know. After obtaining the rein- 
deer, therefore, the next important matter is the procurement of 
skilled herdsmen and teamsters from Norway and Sweden. It is 
of little use to give a herd of reindeer to a missionary station unless 
a skilled teacher goes with it. 
The furnishing of the properly trained Laplander is one of the 
chief items of expense in the introduction of reindeer into northwest- 
ern Alaska. A salary of $200 to $500 a year is necessary for each, and 
the distribution of the herd at the different points on the seacoast and 
in the interior is possible only in so far as the Government is able to 
send these experienced herdsmen and teamsters. In the course of 
eight or ten years there will grow up a supply of thoroughly educated. 
natives who will render it unnecessary to depend any longer upon 
Lapland and Finland for teachers. But it is hoped in the meanwhile 
that there will be some migration from Scandinavia of families of 
herdsmen and teamsters. 
Thus far the original plan of distributing exsell herds to the mission- 
ary stations and furnishing teachers to care for the herds has been 
put into operation in only four instances. To the missionary station 
at Cape Prince of Wales, nearest to the Teller Station at Port Clar- 
ence, 118 deer were furnished in August, 1894, and Mr. Lopp, who had 
mastered the art of caring for the reindeer, having been with our herd 
from the beginning, was made the Government teacher and paid a 
salary. 
The following year 112 deer were loaned to the most promising 
apprentice, Anti-sarlook (called Charlie), stationed at Cape Nome. 
In 1896 two other herds of 50 each were loaned, respectively, to the 
Swedish Evangelical Mission on Golovin Bay and the Episcopal Mis- 
sion at Fort Adams, on the middle Yukon, near the mouth of the 
Tanana River. These herds have been loaned on the condition that 
they are used as apparatus for the instruction of natives in the art of 
herding deer and training them to harness, and on condition that after 
three years the Government may take from the herd a number of
-P-A-G-E-42

  deer in good condition equal to the original number furnished, the 
stations retaining the increase. And, pursuing this policy, negotia- 
tions have been for some time in progress to loan herds on the same 
conditions to the Catholic stations at Nulato and Koserefski (impor- 
tant places on the Yukon) and also to the stations at Point Hope 
(Episcopal) and Point Barrow (Presbyterian) on the Arctic Sea; also 
to the Moravian stations at Bethel, on the Kuskokwim River, and 
Carmel, on Bristol Bay, at the entrance to the Bering Sea on the south. 
In providing education for Alaska it is important that the centers 
of industrial education shall coincide with the points that have to be 
held in hand by the Government for the purposes of relief expeditions, 
and also with those points from which the mining and other industrial 
interests of Alaska can be governed. To illustrate this I mention the 
fact that if the herds which it is proposed to establish at Point Bar- 
row and Point Hope, on the Arctic Ocean, can by any means be 
increased to the number of 5,000 deer, a number not wnusual in Lap- 
land as the possession of a single herdsman, the annual increase of 
such a herd would amount to nearly 2,000 fawns. It is obvious that 
with such resources at two points on the Arctic there never need be 
any further fear of starvation on the part of the crews of whaling ves- 
sels detained by ice in that region. A saving of at least $50,000 to 
the Government would have been effected during the year 1897-98 
had those herds been in position. Again, had herds of 5,000 each 
been at the important strategical points of Nulato, on the great bend 
of the Yukon, at Fort Adams, in the middle Yukon, at the mouth of 
Tanana River, or at Circle City, on the upper Yukon, the danger to 
starving miners would have been very much reduced, if not entirely 
removed. 
Communication with Alaska.—The difficulty met with by all those 
who would visit Alaska is the impossibility of traversing its vast 
distances in the winter. This is the great obstacle to the miner 
who wishes to have access to the gold-bearing regions and to carry 
with him all the conveniences for procuring comfort in the long are- 
tic night. He wishes also to be in constant communication with the 
friends he has left behind him in the States. This is also the great 
obstacle to the missionary who wishes to reach the tribes of native 
population, convert them to Christianity and lead them to adopt 
the arts of civilized life. 
Looking at the map of Alaska, one sees that the great Yukon River 
penetrates the interior from the west, forming a sort of backbone to 
the country. Not realizing the climatic conditions, one would suppose 
that steamboats could keep up fora large portion of the year a com- 
munication with the upper branches of that river situated in British 
America and in the eastern part of Alaska. When he comes to learn, 
however, that the Yukon River is closed by ice for three-fourths of 
the year, he looks southward for other avenues to the interior and 
first notices the inlets of the Northern Pacific between Sitka and
-P-A-G-E-43
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. XL 
Unalaska, namely, Prince William Sound, Cooks Inlet, and Copper 
River. But he finds first high mountains and then a vast table-land 
extending to the north of these places and separating by a distance 
of from 500 to 700 miles the mining regions of the upper Yukon from 
the shipping ports on the ocean. These table-lands can not be trav- 
ersed in the winter by horses or oxen and seareely even by the hardy 
species of dogs that are used for transportation in this region. When 
one considers the difficulties of a journey of 500 to 700 miles through 
a region without settlements and without stores of provisions, one 
looks for another approach to the region, namely, to that from the 
southeast. Bays, or rivers flowing into the archipelago, at the south- 
east will bring the traveler to the foot of the mountains; then if a 
good pass may be found that can be used winter and summer, or if its 
difficulties can be overcome by means of railroads or some method of 
rapid transportation, the visitor to the interior may find himself at 
the head waters of the Yukon. In the future of this Territory it is 
evident that settlements will be formed at distances from 100 to 
300 miles apart from the head waters to the mouth of the river. 
The natural entrance, therefore, into this region in the winter time 
would appear to be the gateways at the southeast, at the northern 
extremities of Lynn Sound, or perhaps at Yakutat Bay. This ques- 
tion of communication with Alaska is so important that it deserves a 
fuller discussion. 
I. The approach to Alaska by way of Bering Sea inadequate for 
purposes of the Government.—V essels that pass into Bering Sea stop 
at the island of Unalaska, where a village of about 300 people is situ- 
ated, which contains a Russian church and a Methodist mission. On 
an island in this harbor, too, the first reindeer, 16 in number, obtained 
in 1891 for the purpose of introducing the reindeer culture into the 
schools of northwest Alaska, were turned loose and have increased to 
' a considerable herd, but are running wild on the island. 
It has not been possible in ordinary winters to continue the voyage 
beyond Unalaska (which is the eastern link of the chain known as 
the Aleutian Islands) into the Bering Sea beyond the Pribyloff Islands 
in winter. On one occasion, however, St. Matthews Island, 400 miles 
north of the Pribyloff and about 200 miles south by west of St. Law- 
rence Island and 400 miles from Bering Strait, was reached, but no 
vessels have ever been able to land at St. Michael or approach the 
mouth of the Yukon or any of the bays north or south of this region 
within a radius of from 50 to 100 miles from the mainland on account 
of the ice. The ice closes in these ports as early as November 1, and 
they are not open again until the 15th of June and occasionally (as 
in 1896) not until the middle of July. These northwestern ports are 
therefore closed to the Government and to commerce from seven and 
one-half to eight and one-half months in the year, leaving from three 
and one-half to four and one-half months for the entire season’s work 
in the northwest.

XLIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  IT. The approach to the interior of Alaska by way of the inlets of the 
ocean between Sitka and Unalaska..—The management of interior 
Alaska could not be conducted by Bering Sea. But it might be con- 
ducted either from some one of the ports on Prince William Sound, or 
Copper River, which empties next to it on the east, or from Cooks Inlet 
to the west of it. Some of the streams flowing into these inlets rise 
near the headwaters of the Tanana, the Forty-Mile Creek, and the 
White River—the Tanana flowing into the middle Yukon, the Forty- 
Mile Creek flowing into the Yukon near the place where the Yukon 
crosses the boundary line that separates Alaska from the British pos- 
sessions, and the White River flowing into the Yukon some 40 miles 
above Dawson in British territory. Should a transportation com- 
pany build a railroad over this route it would furnish a short and 
ready communication from the south immediately into the river val- 
leys that are rich in gold, and large villages would grow up very soon 
at the harbor which formed the starting point of the railroad and at 
its junction and termini. This route would have the advantage of 
being wholly within the boundaries of Alaska. On this line, at the 
headwaters of the four rivers mentioned, one branch could go down 
the Tanana River to Minook on the middle Yukon, and the other 
branch might approach the upper Yukon with a terminus at or about 
Circle City or some point farther south, nearer the British boundary 
and the gold mines of the Klondike. Should this railroad not be 
built by private parties, an express and mail route could be estab- 
lished by reindeer with relay houses built on the entire route at inter- 
vals of from 10 to 20 miles, stocked with provisions and each guarded 
by one or two soldiers. But the reindeer route could not follow the 
canyons of the rivers nor extend into the wooded regions near the 
ocean, because of the lack of moss. The general rule is that where 
trees grow the moss is not to be found. The moss feeds directly on 
the rocks until a humus or soil is formed, and then trees begin to grow. 
Where there is plenty of moisture, as in the river valleys and the 
coast region, the moss has already given place to trees. 
The distance from the southern harbor to the head waters is about 
250 miles, and thence to Minook, at the junction of the Tanana and 
Yukon rivers, is about 300 miles, and about the same distance to the 
Yukon on the east. Over a good trail in the moss-covered district 
the reindeer team with the mail could travel at the rate of 100 to 200 
miles in the twenty-four hours if relays are furnished once in 50 
miles. For in the arctic night one part of the twenty-four hours is 
as good as another for making a journey. Consequently the mail 
from the upper Yukon, and all points down to the middle Yukon, 
could reach, as before asserted, the ocean steamer at Prince William 
Sound in six days from Minook, and in eight days more would reach 
Seattle, making communication from all the upper parts of the Yukon 
two weeks old on reaching Seattle. 
Another point of importance is that all of northwest Alaska can be
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. XLV 
reached by reindeer express from Minook, near the mouth of the 
Tanana on the middle Yukon. The distance from Minook to St. 
Michael is about 600 miles, and from Minook to Cape Prince of 
Wales about 800 miles. It is evident that with reindeer all the way, 
or with a railroad for a part of the way from Prince William Sound, 
all parts of Alaska can be reached by reindeer transportation at any 
time in the winter, and with 50-mile relays the reindeer could bring 
mail from St. Michael to Minook in six days, and in eight days all the 
way from Cape Prince of Wales to Minook, or even from Point Bar- 
row, which is the same distance from Minook as the Cape Prince of 
Wales. Commercial companies could then hear from their whaling 
fleets, getting news not more than a month old on arrival at Seattle. 
III. The approach to the interior of Alaska by Chilkat on the south- 
east.—Southeastern Alaska, including the Alexander Archipelago, in 
which Sitka and the neighboring islands are situated, is accessible at 
all times of the year. A bimonthly steamer has for years sailed from 
Seattle to the northernmost inlet which opens beyond Juneau and 
extends to Dyea. Since the gold excitement trips are more frequent. 
Of the harbors in the north of this inlet up Lynn Sound, those at 
Chilkat and Haines, are deep; that of Dyea is shallow. 
Inasmuch as the matter of opening up a railroad communication 
from Prince William Sound or from Cooks Inlet is a mere project, and 
inasmuch as it would not be feasible to make a reindeer route to or 
from either of these places until oceanic steamship lines, or an exten- 
sion of the steamship line from Sitka has made terminal points of these 
places, the only alternative for the present action is to complete com- 
munication from Chilkat or Haines in the northern inlets of the head- 
waters of the channel with the upper Yukon by White Pass (from 
Skagway), Chilkoot Pass (from Dyea), or by Chilkat Pass at the head- 
waters of the Chilkat River to Lake Arkell, or farther to the west on 
a route sometimes called the ‘‘ Dalton trail,” a Mr. Dalton having the 
past season driven some 500 head of cattle and 6,000 sheep over this 
route to the gold regions. If a railroad should be constructed from 
Dyea to the navigable waters that descend into the Yukon, there 
would still be occasion for reindeer transportation 400 or 500 miles 
beyond to the gold regions for seven or eights months in the year. 
The winter climate of Alaska.—It is very difficult to realize the con- 
ditions prevalent in Alaska in the winter time. In places where the 
wind from the southwest comes laden with moisture from the ocean, 
the snow sometimes falls in the course of the winter to a depth of 12 
feet. Where the high mountains cause the south winds to lose a large 
portion of their moisture the snow fall is much less. The temperature 
in some months of the year will average many degrees below zero, fre- 
quently dipping as low as 50, 60, or even 70 degrees “below zero, Fah- 
renheit. Other months of the same winter will have a temperature, for 
the entire month, of from zero to freezing point, comparatively comfort- 
able weather. The meteorological records kept in this region show 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
XLVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  that tne coldest month may be December, January, or February. 
There is great variation from one year to another. Sometimes there 
is a month in which a storm occurs on an average twice a week for a 
whole month together. In order to imagine the terrors of a storm in 
Alaska, one must conceive a perpetual night varying from twilight 
at midday to the blackest darkness for three-fourths of the day, and 
in this night he must conceive a Minnesota blizzard in which the 
thermometer instead of varying from zero to 30 degrees below, as in 
Minnesota, varies from 30 to 60 degrees below. The impossibility of 
combating such a storm is obvious. 
Communication over the surface of the snow.—For eight months of 
the year central and northern Alaska may be conceived as a vast snow - 
field; it is not the more difficult to penetrate on that account, how- 
ever. The snow covers the region like a vast white asphalt pavement. 
It fills up the small crevices and the deep gulches and makes one 
smooth surface undulating with the hills and valleys. On the surface 
of the snow is a hard crust which will bear up men and animals and 
especially the reindeer with his broad foot. While the winter time 
ean not be used at all for transportation on the Arctic Ocean or Bering 
Sea or on the rivers of Alaska, the long winter is capable of being used 
by the reindeer for communication throughout the interior. Ona 
snow surface, with not too steep hills or too deep valleys, the reindeer 
can travel his 50, 70, or even 90 miles a day, getting his food at meal 
times by thrusting his tough lips through the snow to the moss. 
The supply of reindeer moss for food.—Conceive all Alaska as one 
vast rock. The forces of nature—the sun, the rains, the frosts, the 
vital power of the seeds of the moss and of hardy trees—all these 
elements work on the rock to subdue it for vegetation. On the coast 
near the ocean where the winds are laden with moisture as well as on 
the river valleys the first beginnings of vegetation appeared. The 
rock was eaten into by the moss plant. After the moss had flourished 
for untold ages it had created a humus or soil in which the seeds of 
other plants could take root. The moss epoch then was followed by 
the tree epoch. When the trees grew in the river valleys and on the 
coast regions the moss could not any longer flourish. But by this 
time the moss had conquered the rock regions far up the mountain 
sides and over all the hills in Alaska even up to the Arctic Ocean. 
This gives at one glance the actual view of the situation in Alaska. 
Around the southern coasts and in the river valleys trees flourish and 
moss is not found. Back on the hills and for a mile up the high 
mountains reindeer moss is to be found in immense quantities. A 
careful estimate finds sufficient food for ten millions of reindeer, 
basing the estimate on the present capacity of Finland and Lapland 
for the support of the reindeer. 
But the routes for reindeer travel must not be laid out in river val- 
leys nor along the coast of the ocean. The reindeer would starve on 
account of lack of moss. This was theactual experience in the journey 
/

made by Mr. Kjellmann in the winter of 1897, from Port Clarence south 
to Bristol Bay. He accomplished the cther parts of his journey, even 
the scaling of high mountain passes without difficulty, but in attempt- 
ing to conduct a portion of his return journey through the forest 
between the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers he could not find moss 
enough to subsist his reindeer except by cutting down trees and using 
an inferior quality of moss. As it was, a half dozen of his deer per- 
ished. These reindeer journeys can be accomplished only on trails 
leading over the hills above the river valleys. . 
The introduction of reindeer from Siberia into Alaska.—The impor- 
tation of reindeer from Siberia has settled favorably all the questions 
of the Alaska problem except the facility of obtaining a‘supply and 
the possibility of obtaining it at any time of the year. 
The following table shows at a glance the number imported each 
year already mentioned above:

  The 16 reindeer obtained in 1891 were turned loose on Amaknak 
Island, Unalaska, and have increased, but the exact number is not 
now known. ‘The other 538 deer have been herded carefully and their 
present number is 1,466, of which 466 was the increase in fawns in the 
spring of 1897. 
It will be seen by the above table that 538 reindeer purchased dur- 
ing the four years, 1892 to 1895, an average of 134 per annum, have 
increased to 1,466 deer. It is said that the deer born on the Ameri- 
ean side are heavier than the average deer imported from Siberia. 
If the Government herd amounted to 5,000 deer the annual increase 
would be between 2,000 and 3,000, a sufficient number to stock all the 
mission stations in Alaska. 
The following table shows the location of these deer on June 30,

  Herds numbered 2 and 5 have been ordered to Point Barrow to

  Carried forward _.   
The herdsmen first imported from Siberia were members of the 
Indian tribes, superstitious and uncivilized in their habits. Their 
method of caring for the deer during the time of fawning was not 
good. 
Since obtaining five families (seventeen persons in all) from Lap- 
land in 1894 the training of the reindeer has proceeded more satis- 
factorily. The Eskimo apprentices, some twenty-five in number, 
have learned enough to make them good assistant herdsmen and two 
of them are excellent teamsters; but it would seem that five years’ 
apprenticeship is required to make intelligent people well acquainted 
with all the methods needed in training the reindeer to harness, in 
caring for the young, and with the various other arts which are in 
possession of the herdsmen’s families in Finland and Lapland. 
The great difficulty, however, in the experiment in northwestern 
Alaska is the obtaining of efficient herdsmen. Three of the families 
of Lapps, after remaining the three years agreed upon, have returned 
to Lapland. While two skilled Lapp herders, with their boys and with 
Eskimo apprentices, can handle a large herd of 1,000 or 2,000 reindeer, 
it requires one Laplander to each ten reindeer trained to the harness 
as teamsters. 
The one link necessary for this satisfactory solution of Alaskan 
problems is the supply of a sufficient number of reindeer trained to 
the harness and herders and teamsters from Lapland and Finland 
skilled in the business. While the deer are large and strong the 
herdsmen and teamsters obtained from Siberia are of little avail. 
The methods of the Laplanders, which have been tried during the 
past three years, have proved to be far better than those of the Sibe- 
rians. They are superior to the Siberians in the management of the 
reindeer in the harness, in kindness to them, in civilized habits of 
living (the Laplanders being a Christian people, the Siberians hav- 
ing a low form of fetichism), and in the use of a language that is 
known to Europeans.

EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 
  Of transportation by dogs, Dr. Jackson says: 
The dog in the Arctic seems to be a middle-sized one, with much of the appear- 
ance and habits of the wolf. They are a hardy animal, suited to their environ- 
ment. From five to eight make a good team. They are frequently hitched up 
tandem. When traveling an attendant usually runs in front, while a second 
guidesthe sled. They willmake as many miles ina day as the attendant running in 
front can lead them, and will carry on the sled about 125 pounds to the dog. When 
traveling they are fed from 1 to 14 pounds of dry fish per day. Whenat home they 
are allowed to forage for themselves. If a sled load of freight is drawn by dogs 
a second sled load is necessary for carrying provisions for the two teams of dogs, 
if the journey is along one. Consequently it is impossible to utilize dogs on jour- 
neys very distant from sources of supply of dog food. Since the rapid increase of 
the white population in Alaska, and the development of the mines, dog transpor- 
tation has proved entirely inadequate, although the necessity has been so great 
that the price of dogs has run up to $100 and $200 apiece. A year ago this fall the 
steamer Bella was frozen in at Fort Yukon, 80 miles distant from Circle City. 
An effort was made to forward the provisions from the steamer by dog teams on 
the ice to Circle City and Dawson, but the effort failed. It was found impossible 
to move the food in sufficient quantities and with sufficient speed to supply the 
miners of the Yukon, and by spring flour had advanced at Dawson City from 
$50 to $125 per hundred pounds, 
The Bureau of Education has been charged with the care of edu- 
eation in Alaska. The object proposed from the beginning by the 
Commissioners preceding me, General Eaton and Colonel Dawson, has 
been to provide such education as to prepare the natives to take up 
the industries and modes of life established in the States by our white 
population, and by all means not try to continue the tribal life after the 
manner of the Indians in the western States and Territories. If the 
natives of Alaska could be taught the English language, be brought 
under Christian influences by the missionaries and trained into the 
forms of industry suitable for the Territory, it seems to follow as a 
necessary result that the white population of Alaska, composed of 
immigrants from the States, would be able to employ them in their 
pursuits, using their labor to assist in mining, transportation, and 
in the production of food. A population of 40,000 natives engaged 
in reindeer herding and transportation would furnish the contingent 
needed to complement or make possible the mining industry. After 
cautious experiments in 1891, 1892, and 1893, and especially after the 
arrival of the Lapland families as herdsmen in 1894, it has become 
certain that the experiment will prove a success. A herd of from 100 
to 500 reindeer should be placed at each mission station together with 
a Lapland herdsman who can instruct twenty or thirty apprentices 
in the management of the deer. The wages for work done in behalf 
of the mission station, as has been shown, can be paid by the trans- 
fer of reindeer to these apprentices, so that after sufficient skill has 
been acquired the apprentices will have with them the nucleus of 
a herd of reindeer to commence their career with. They and their 
sons will by-and by take the reindeer trained for harness and find a 
profitable employment with transportation companies. At home a

large herd will accumulate, furnishing food in the form of reindeer 
milk and reindeer meat.

With herds of from 1,000 to 5,000 at each of these stations as already 
intimated, there need never be the slightest fear regarding the whalers 
who are caught in the ice before reaching Bering Strait. If they can 
not bring their vessels to the protected harbors near by the missionary 
stations they can at least escape over the ice and obtain sure subsist- 
ence untilspring time. They can load their vessels, in fact, with sup- 
plies from one of these stations and on the breaking up of the ice in 
the spring continue their whaling voyages.

It has been shown that stations like those on the Arctic Ocean can 
all be placed in sufficient communication in the winter months with 
the States through reindeer expresses sent with the mail to and from 
Minook, on the middle Yukon, the most distant station being only 
four days out by the swiftest mail, established by relays, or only six- 
teen days by the slowest form of reindeer express.

tance for transportation in the winter time, and besides the mission- 
ary stations there wiil doubtless spring up many camps of miners from 
the middle Yukon on to its highest sources and also along all of the 
tributaries on which gold may be found. Itis too much to expect that 
miners will raise herds of reindeer, or indeed that reindeer can possi- 
bly be raised in the immediate vicinity of a mining camp, but the 
missionary stations removed at a safe distance from these villages can 
produce hundreds and thousands of reindeer, together with skilled 
natives who have learned to speak the English language and have 
acquired the manners and customs of our people. These will become 
herdsmen and teamsters for the mines. 
4. The Aleutian Islands. On one of these (20) Unalaska has a 
missionary establishment, Methodist, with two missionaries and one 
Government teacher. 
The Aleutian Islands are all said to be moss-bearing, and they 
should all have herds of reindeer. If not tame, at least a few should 
be placed on each island to run wild and stock the pastures. 
5. The missionary stations along the northern Pacific Coast between 
Sitka and Unalaska are:

The voyage from Sitka to Unalaska, almost directly west, is 1,200 
miles. Along this coast the above missionary stations are established. 
Transportation with the interior of Alaska from these stations will be 
made possible by the possession of reindeer herds.

    LI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
These stations can not at present be used for education in the art 
of managing the reindeer for the lack of moss fields. It is therefore 
deemed very important that a large herd of reindeer should be placed. 
as near as possible to this region, namely, at some point northwest of 
the Lynn Canal, as near as possible to Chilkat. To this place could 
be sent enterprising and promising young men from the mission 
schools in the Sitka Archipelago to be trained for teamsters and 
herdsmen, for it is at this point, as has already been pointed out, that 
the problem of winter communication with Alaska, so necessary to 
its Government management, must be solved. 
The reindeer transportation must move out from the north of the 
Lynn Canal at Chilkat or Dyea. There should be an appropriation 
of $25,000 per annum for the expense of the camp of a reindeer sta- 
tion at this place—that is, as near as possible to the Lynn Canal— 
although probably the place selected on Alaskan territory for this 
purpose must be between the headwaters of the Tanana and White 
rivers, and 300 miles northwest of Chilkat. This herd should be 
increased from year to year until it amounts to 5,000, in order to 
hurry forward the works of developing the resources of Alaska by 
reindeer culture. 
The Government may ultimately be able from time to time to dines 
of a sufficient number of these reindeer to reimburse the Treasury for 
the expense incurred. It is desirable, of course, as soon as possible 
after a demonstration has been made of the practicability of the 
scheme and its best methods have been discovered, that private enter- 
prise shall take up and carry on the industry, but it is all important 
that at least one part of the reindeer industry should be kept along 
its present lines until the natives of Alaska have been elevated from 
the status of a hunting and fishing civilization to that of farming and 
grazing. But if the reindeer enterprise gets entirely into the control 
of private business parties before this is accomplished its benefits 
may be turned away from the native people. It is therefore very 
important that the missionary stations shall be supplied with reindeer 
herds after the plan already inaugurated by this Bureau. 
All of which is respectfully submitted. *

Commissioner.

  STATE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEMS. LX 
Observations on Table 8.—The *‘ aggregatenumber of days’ schooling given” to all 
pupils (see column 6), which is the same thing as the aggregate number of days 
attended by ail the pupils, has been computed for those States which do not make 
an explicit report of this item by multiplying the average daily attendance of 
pupils by the average length of school term in days. 
Conversely, the average length of school term (column 5) for the United States 
as a whole and for each of its geographical divisions has been obtained by dividing 
the aggregate number of days attended by the average daily attendance. 
By this method the school term of each State, in computing the average term 
for a number of States, is in fact given a weight proportioned to the school 
attendance of the State, as should be done under a correct interpretation of the 
expression ‘‘Average length of school term.” The result might more properly be 
called ‘‘Average length of attendance,” which is essentially what it is desired to 
know. 
A method which has been in use in some States for finding the average school 
' term, of a county, for instance, is to weight the different school terms of the towns 
or districts the county is composed of by the number of schools in each. In other 
words, the total number of days (or months) all the schools of a county were kept 
is divided by the total number of schools to get the average time each one was 
kept. So, in finding the average term for the State, the school is taken as the unit 
instead of the pupil. When the schools differ much in size (number of pupils), 
as they do in all mixed urban and rural systems, varying from some half a dozen 
to 500 or more pupils each, the average term obtained by this method varies con- 
siderably from that obtained by the Bureau’s method. The long terms of the 
large city schools not being given their proper weight, the resulting average is 
too small. The same objection applies still more forcibly to weighting the school 
terms of the different counties or towns by the number of school districts in each. 
Still another method is to add together the school terms of the different counties 
or towns and divide by the number of such counties or towns; i. e., the simple 
arithmetical mean is taken. An example of this occurs in a school report, where 
it is stated that 14,193 pupils attended 185 days and 856 other pupils attended 160 
days, while the average time the whole 15,049 pupils attended is computed at 1724 
days, although nearly all (16 out of every 17) attended 185 days. This method, if 
it can be so called, gives altogether too short an average term, and nothing can be 
said in defense of it. It is as if, wishing to get the population per square mile of 
Minnesota and Dakota combined, we said, Minnesota, 9.86; Dakota, 0.92; average 
number of persons per square mile in the combined territory (0.92+-9.86) —2=5.39, 
instead of dividing the total population of the two States by the combined area in 
square miles. 
The ‘‘ aggregate number of days’ attendance ” is a statistical item of the utmost 
simplicity and of great value, about the meaning of which there can be little or 
no difference of opinion. Every teacher’s register that records the number of 
pupils present each day in any school, as they all presumably do, contains the data 
for ascertaining it for that school for the school year by the simple process of 
addition or summing up.

Average salaries.—In computing (for Table 12) the average monthly wages of 
all the male (or female) teachers in a group of States, the average wages of each 
of the States in question is multiplied by the corresponding number of teachers. 
The sum of the resulting products is then divided by the sum of the teachers, and 
the quotient is the average wages of all. Each rate of wages thus receives its due 
weight.

      LXVIII_ REPORT OF 
  THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
   To illustrate the principle: If 48 teachers receive an average of $72.20 per month, 
they all receive in a month $3,466; if 473 other teachers receive an average of 
$48.60 per month, these together receive in a month $22,988; all the 521 teachers 
combined therefore receive per month $26,454, or an average of $50.77. 
Attention is called to this matter for the reason that the practice of taking the 
arithmetical mean of a number of rates of wages (the mean is $60.40 in the above 
case) in order to get the average of all is so common as to vitiate, to a considerable 
extent, the published statistics of average wages. -

4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
TOPICAL OUTLINE.—Brief conspectus of the educational system of England— 
Educational statistics—Legislation of 1897 and survey of antecedent laws— 
Education in London. 
  Brief conspectus of the English system.—Elementary education alone has been 
organized into a system which is maintained by the combined effort of State and 
local authorities. 
The action of the State is limited to securing through local agencies adequate 
provision for the instruction of all children. An annual grant is made by Parlia- 
ment, $21,174,735 in 1896, which is distributed to the managers of schools, public 
and private, that fulfill specified conditions. These pertain to the equipment and 
staffing of the school, the duration of the annual session, the course of study, and 
the results of instruction. A grant in lieu of fees is also made for schools remit- 
ting the same, amounting in 1896 to $10,689,638. This sum with the grant above 
named makes a total of $31,864,403, or 64 per cent of the entire school expenditure 
from the public treasury. 
A committee of council (education department) is charged with the distribution 
of the grant and maintains a force of inspectors, who must make an inspection of 
every school twice a year and report as to its efficiency, equipment, etc. The 
report of the inspector determines the amount of the grant to which the school is 
entitled. 
The local school authorities are elective school boards or private managers, and 
the schools are characterized as board or voluntary, according to the management. 
Board schoo's are maintained in part by local taxes, yielding $10,627,422 in 1896. 
Private schools have no claim upon these, but draw a portion of their support 
from endowments and subscriptions. Fees may be charged in either class of 
schools, but have been generally remitted since the passage of the law of 1890, 
providing for the additional grant. Board schools must be nonsectarian, and 
private schools, even if parochial, are restrained by a ‘‘conscience clause” in the 
education law of 1870 from forcing religious instruction upon pupils. 
School districts must enact compulsory by-laws applicable to all children between 
the ages of 5 and 14 unless they have obtained the educational certificate which 
alone entitles them to exemption. The age for exemption can not be less than 11 
years, and under the by-laws of many districts exceeds that limit. 
The teaching staff of a school comprises certificated teachers, assistants on pro- 
bation, and pupil teachers. The last named are regarded as teachers in training, 
and an additional.grant is made to the school on their account. 
Teachers’ training colleges established by private managers also receive appro- 
priations from the State. 
The system of education in Scotland, based upon the law of 1872, presents sub- 
stantially the saine features as that of England; i. e., it is a State-aided system in 
which local authorities have large liberty of action. 
The Irish system, although differing materially from those of England and Scot- 
land in respect to the nature and the relations of the central and local authorities, 
is maintained also by the combined action of the two.    
The current statistics of education in the United Kingdom are here 
presented, followed by a comparative view of the principal statistics 
of elementary education for England and Scotland.

  6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
LEGISLATION OF 1897. 
The Commissioner’s report for 1895-96 contained a full account of 
the English education bill introduced into the House of Commons 
by Sir John Gorst, vice-president of the education department, April, 
1896. The bill was intended to provide additional support from 
public funds for elementary schools and to reorganize the local 
administration of the schools. The measure was the outcome of 
promises of additional aid to parochial (voluntary) schools made dur- 
ing the campaign of 1895 by the leaders of the Conservative party, 
but, although supported at the outset by an immense majority, it col- 
lapsed in the second week of the committee debate on the proposals 
respecting local administration. In withdrawing the bill Mr. Balfour, 
the leader of the House of Commons, intimated that its consideration 
would be resumed in January, 1897. It was, however, generally under- 
stood that this particular measure was abandoned, and such proved to 
be the case. Since the promises that had been made to the mana- 
gers of parochial schools could not be ignored, a new bill was pre- 
sented by Mr. Balfour in February, 1897, the scope of which is set 
forth in the following resolution: 
That it is expedient (a) to authorize the payment out of moneys to be provided 
by Parliament of an aid grant to voluntary schools not exceeding 5 shillings per 
scholar for the whole number of scholars in those schools; (b) to repeal, as regards 
day schools, so much of section 19 of the elementary education act, 1876, as 
imposes a limit on the Parliamentary grant to elementary schools in England and 
Wales, and (c) to make provision for the exemption from rates of voluntary 
schools, 
Introduced as a money bill, precedence was given to this measure 
over other matters, and it was pushed rapidly through the three read- 
ings in the House of Commons and the committee stage, and was 
finally passed by both Houses April 5 and received royal sanction a 
few days later. 
The text of the law is as follows: 
AID GRANT TO VOLUNTARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
1. (1) For aiding voluntary schools there shall be annually paid, out of moneys 
provided by Parliament, an aid grant not exceeding in the aggregate 5 shillings 
per scholar for the whole number of scholars in those schools. 
(2) The aid grant shall be distributed by the education department to such 
voluntary schools and in such manner and amounts as the department think best 
for the purpose of helping necessitous schools and increasing their efficiency, due 
regard being had to the maintenance of voluntary subscriptions. 
(8) If associations of schools are constituted in such manner, in such areas, and 
with such governing bodies representative of the managers as are approved by 
the education department, there shall be allotted to each association while so 
approved— 
(a) A share of the aid grant to be computed according to the number of schol- 
ars in th> schools of the association at the rate of 5 shillings per scholar, or, if the
-P-A-G-E-87
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 7 
department fix different rates for town and country schools, respectively (which 
they are hereby empowered to do), then at those rates; and 
(b) A corresponding share of any sum which may be available out of the aid 
grant after distribution has been made to unassociated schools. 
(4) The share so allotted to each such association shall be distributed as afore- 
said by the education department, after consulting the governing body of the asso- 
ciation, and in accordance with any scheme prepared by that body which the 
department for the time being approve. 
(5) The education department may exclude a school from any share of the aid 
grant which it might otherwise receive if, in the opinion of the department, it 
unreasonably refuses or fails to join such an association, but the refusal or failure 
shall not be deemed unreasonable if the majority of the schools in the association 
belong to a religious denomination to which the school in question does not itself 
belong. 
(6) The education department may require, as a condition of a school receiving 
a share of the aid grant, that the accounts of the receipts and expenditures of 
the school shall be annually audited, in accordance with the regulations of the 
department. 
(7) The decision of the education department upon any question relating to the 
distribution or allotment of the aid grant, including the question whether an asso- 
ciation is or is not in conformity with this act, and whether a school is a town or 
a country school, shall be final. 
REPEAL OF 17s. 6D. LIMIT RESPECTING DAY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 
2. After the last day of March, 1897, the following words in section 19 of the 
elementary education act, 1876, namely, ‘‘Such grant shall not in any year be 
reduced by reason of its excess above the income of the school, if the grant do not 
exceed the amount of 17s. 6d. per child in average attendance at the school during 
that year, but shall not exceed that amount per child, except by the same sum by 
which the income of the school derived from voluntary contributions, rates, school 
fees, endowments, or any source whatever other than the Parliamentary grant, 
exceeds the same amount per child, and” shall be repealed so far as they apply to 
day schools in England and Wales. 
EXEMPTION FROM RATES OF VOLUNTARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
8. No person shall be assessed or rated to or for any local rate in respect of any 
land or buildings used exclusively or mainly for the purposes of the schoolrooms, 
offices, or playground of a voluntary ‘school except to the extent of any profit 
derived by the managers of the school from the letting thereof. 
DEFINITIONS. 
4, In this act, unless the context otherwise requires— 
The expression ‘‘ voluntary school” means a public elementary day school not 
provided by a school board. 
Any reference to the number of scholars in schools means the number of scholars 
in average attendance, as computed by the education department. 
The expression ‘local rate” means a rate the proceeds of which are applicable 
to public local purposes and which is leviable on the basis of an assessment in 
respect of the yearly value of property and includes any sum which, though 
obtained in the first instance by a precept, certificate, or other instrument requir- 
ing payment from some authority or officer, is or can be ultimately raised out of 
a local rate, as before defined. 
Other expressions have the same meaning as in the elementary education acts, 
1837 to 1893.

    8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
EXTENT OF ACT AND SHORT TITLE. 
5. (1) This act shall not extend to Scotland or Ireland. 
(2) This act may be cited as the ‘voluntary schools act, 1897.” 
The sum placed at the disposal of parochial schools by this law 
amounts for the current year to $3,050,000. The measure was opposed 
by the Liberal party on the ground principally that it provided for 
sectarian endowment. It was further urged that the relief it offered 
was entirely inadequate to the needs it was intended to meet. More- 
over, the new administrative agency created by clause 3, section 1, 
providing for the federation of schools, was regarded as especially 
obnoxious. The Liberals were not alone in their objections to these 
features, which were criticized by many Conservative members who, 
however, voted for the measures. 
The following citations from speeches made in Parliament or on the 
public platform during the debate emphasize these points. 
Upon the inadequacy of the relief provided, Mr. Yoxall, who repre- 
sents the interests of elementary education in Parliament, spoke as 
follows: 
With the State aid grant, according to the vice-president, the committee of 
council are to bring about certain reforms in the management of schools. He 
hoped the vice-president would be able to do all he proposed to do, but the ideas 
of the right honorable gentleman were not embodied in the bill. Unless they were 
so embodied there was no security whatever that those admirable ideas would be 
carried out. But even if they were placed in the bill in the shape of specific 
amendments, and if it were determined to spend the money upon the purposes 
indicated, the money was entirely inadequate. To take the first thing referred 
to by the vice-president, the single-handed schools alone would require some 
£300,000 out of the £600,000. One-half of the money would go on that provision 
alone. Next they were told that the money was to be used in giving better 
salaries to the wretchedly paid teachers in the voluntary schools. The whole 
grant would not suffice to do that. The Government were going to give as 
a whole 5 shillings per child, but the deficiency between the board school 
and the voluntary school was 12 shillings per child, and of that 9 shillings per 
child came out of the pockets of the voluntary school teachers. How, therefore, 
the purposes of the vice-president were going to be defrayed out of a grant of 5 
shillings per child he entirely failed to see. There was nothing in the bill or in 
the speech of the vice-president which would prevent the money from being spent 
more and more upon rates, taxes, fuel, lighting, and cleaning. The only way to 
prevent the leakage of the money voted by Parliament to noneducational purposes 
was to give some direct popular representation of the management of the schools. 
That need not interfere with the denominational character of the schools. It 
was also the only way to prevent the dismissal of teachers for all sorts of reasons 
other than legitimate reasons. As to these associations, he feared that unless 
express provisions were inserted in the bill to prevent it, alarge part of the money 
voted would go to defray the organizing expenses of the associations. : 
In reply to Mr. Balfour’s exclamation that this was quite impossible 
under the bill, Mr. Yoxall continued: 
Last year the London diocesan board distributed £2,265 ($11,325) among poor 
schools, but the expenses, including the inspection of the schools’in religious 
knowledge, were £1,384 ($6,920). He hoped that safeguarding clauses would be 
inserted in committee.
-P-A-G-E-89
  
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 9 
As to the association of schools provided for in clause 3, Mr. Jebb, 
who favored the bill, gave the following indorsement: 
The cardinal feature [he said] of the machinery of the bill was, of course, the 
principle of association for the voluntary schools. It appeared to him it was not 
adequately recognized by honorable gentlemen opposite that some such grouping 
of voluntary schools was a matter of necessity for the purpose of distributing the 
grant. There were in England and Wales upward of 14,000 voluntary schools, 
and the grant was to be distributed according to the needs of the schools. It 
would be impossible for the education department, dealing individually with 
upward of 14,000 schools, to discriminate between their relative needs. 
For the purpose of comparison and discrimination the area of the whole country 
was too vast. It was evident there must be some limit to the areas. On the other 
hand, it was clearly right that the department should have a veto on the area, 
because if the area adopted were too small it would not fairly represent the aver- 
age of the needs. In the case of the Church of England the obvious area was the 
diocese. It must not be overlooked that the education department had the con- 
trol of the constitution of the governing body on the councilof an association. 
For example, the department might insist that on the council of every diocesan 
association, or any other association of voluntary schools, there should be a certain 
representation of laymen, and he thought it was highly probable that the depart- 
ment would insist upon such representation. Honorable members had maintained 
that there should be representative popular control, but the bill did not touch the 
management of the individua! schools; that was altogether beyond its scope. The 
pill took the existing managing bodies of voluntary schools and invited them to 
nominate representatives on the council of each association, and the definite pub- 
lic guarantee for the proper constitution of the council was the control exercised 
and the veto possessed by the education department. In his opinion the bill 
afforded a most effective guarantee against any misapplication of the money 
granted, and the associations themselves would necessarily be of great educational 
value in the districts to which they belonged, for they would bring together the 
managers of voluntary schools in common council and common action. By doing 
so they would necessarily stimulate a local interest in educational work. They 
would probably tend to keep up an average of local efficiency. (School Board 
Chronicle, February 20, 1897.) 
This favorable view of the principle of federation was not gener- 
ally held by the Liberals. The abuses and confusion to which it might 
give rise were emphasized by the Liberal leader, Sir William Har- 
court, both in and out of the House. 
In a speech opposing the bill he maintained that, so far from having 
a common object, the members of these associations would each have 
the sole object of getting as much of the money for himself as pos- 
sible and allowing as little as possible to go to anyone else. 
As to the revisory power reposed in the vice-president of the edu- 
cation department, he said: 
To have an absolute power to remold this scheme is to encounter the ecclesias- 
tics from a population of a million and to rejudge their acts, to redress their 
injustice, and to give to those who have not received what they ought to have had 
and to take away from those who have got what they ought not to have had. 
I would really ask, Is this a practical question?

  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  Applying to it ordinary intelligence and some experience of the questions, and 
the districts, and the habits of the people who will haye to deal with this question, 
unless some very different explanation can be given than any yet offered, I must 
pronounce it to be the most preposterous and absurd scheme that was ever sub- 
mitted to the judgment of the House of Commons. 
The discriminating character of a special grant of this kind was 
emphasized by concrete illustrations in a speech by Sir William Har- 
court before a public meeting which, as it throws many side lights on 
the peculiar complications of the ‘‘dual school” system, and also on 
the tactics employed in carrying the measure, is here cited in extenso. 
Under this bill [said Mr. Harcourt] in Lancashire they will get about £114,000 
($570,000). What do you think London, which has about the same number of schol- 
ars, is to have? They are to get £42,000 ($210,000), just about one-third, because 
the money is to be given to voluntary schools. There are more voluntary schools 
in Lancashire, and few in London, and therefore Lancashire is to get £114,000 
($570,000) and London £42,000 ($210,000). I will tell you what London is entitled 
to for the board schools, as nearly as possible—£100,000 ($500,000). But do you 
think you are going to get it? All I can say is that if you do, your faith must be 
like a grain of mustard seed. Let us examine this bill. Take Lancashire, for 
instance. Lancashire is a very rich county, but the real truth is that in Lanca- 
shire more than anywhere else there is great difficulty in getting subscriptions to 
the voluntary schools. There is much less sacrifice made there than in many 
parts of the country—much less sacrifice than is made in the southern counties 
that are so much poorer, and where board schools are supported by the rates— 
and yet you are going to assist the one and not assist the other. Let me 
say this more about the bill. You can hardly call this a bill at all. When 
you come to look at it, nothing is defined. No conditions are laid down in any 
proper or adequate way as to the security of dealing with this money. Instead 
of calling it a bill I should call it a head for a bill for sectarian endowments. 
Now, that is the first principle that we contend for, namely, equality of treat- 
ment for the board schools and the voluntary schools. That is refused. We hear 
much about the intolerable strain upon voluntary schools. Is there no intoler- 
able strain on the rate payers? They say that voluntary schools are about to 
be starved out of existence. But voluntary schools have gone on growing and 
growing. What their friends are jealous of and can not bear is that the national 
popular schools—the board schools—grow also. When the board schools were 
established—and I had the satisfaction of taking a principal part in establishing 
the principle of board schools—they were introduced to make up the deficiencies 
of voluntary effort; but so great were the deficiencies of voluntary effort that the 
board schools have been compelled to fill up nearly half of the vacuum, and they 
are therefore entitled to at least as much consideration to fair treatment as the vol- 
untary schools. Now, let me go to the next principle for which we contend. We 
have never denied that aid should be given to the voluntary schools, because our 
object is to get good education, and in many of the voluntary schools, and in some of 
the board schools, too, the education is not as good as it ought to be, because they 
can not afford adequate teaching staffs. 
Therefore, so long as you deal fairly toward both classes of schools, we are not 
opposed to giving assistance to voluntary schools as well as to board schools. 
That must be clearly understood. What we say is this: If you are going to give 
this vast sum of money, let it be given on fair conditions in the application of that 
money, whether it is to board schools or to voluntary schools. In this country 
there are a number of schools that have no voluntary contributions at all. What 
an abuse of terms that is to claim special privileges for them when there is no 
voluntary contribution and they are entirely sustained by public moncy or by the
-P-A-G-E-91
    
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. ae geet 
fees they exact from the children. There is another very important thing. There 
are 8,000 schools in this country where nonconformists have no access except to 
denominational schools. Now, what ought to be the case if you are going to give 
still larger sums of money to these voluntary schools? What we have asked and 
what we have contended for is that, as a complement to this new grant, there 
shall be popular representation. That is the next fundamental principle for which 
we contend. Is thatasound principle? Iwill read you a passage which expresses 
my view on that subject: 
‘““The existence of sectarian schools supported by a State grant is, no doubt, a 
very serious question, and one which some day or another ought to receive 
consideration. 
“Well, that day has arrived. 
«* Whenever the time comes for this discussion, I for one shall not hesitate to 
express my opinion that contributions of Government money, whether great or 
small, ought in all cases to be accompanied by some form of representative control. 
To my mind the spectacle of a so-called national school turned into a private pre- 
serve for a clerical minority and used for exclusive purposes of politics or religion 
is one which ought not to be tolerated.” 
That is a doctrine admirably expressed.. It is from Mr. Chamberlain, one of 
the responsible authors of this present bill. 
That was the important principle for which we were contending. We wereonly 
allowed one night’s debate upon it, but it was a very remarkable debate, because 
in that debate man after man rose from the Government side of the House and 
implored the Government to act upon this principle to admit popular represen- 
tation—not an overwhelming representation, which would have destroyed the 
denominational character of the schools. It was a most deplorable scene. I have 
had a pretty long Parliamentary experience, but I have never yet seen a great 
Government with a great majority obliged, in the very earliest stages of the prin- 
cipal bill of their session, to coerce their own followers by a threat of resignation. 
(School Board Chronicle, March 13, 1897.)    
The progress of federation as provided for in the third clause of the 
law has been rapid, and the character of the governing bodies already 
formed seems to justify the demand that the law should provide 
explicitly for a certain proportion of professional experts in each of the 
governing bodies, to avoid the dangers of the extreme clerical tend- 
ency. The Church of England schools are being formed into asso- 
ciations, generally on the basis of the diocese all over the country, 
but very few teachers are admitted to the management. The Wes- 
leyans alone seem inclined to give fair representation to those directly 
engaged in the work of the schools. 
Immediately upon the passage of the bill in aid of denominational 
schools, Sir John Gorst moved a resolution for bringing in a bill in 
the interest of board schools in poor districts. The bill, which was 
admitted and passed without delay, increases slightly the grant to the 
class of schools named, appropriating for this purpose the small 
amount of $553,010. The discrepancy between the two measures of 
relief was tersely summed up by Mr. Acland, as follows: 
The voluntary schools, educating indifferently two and a half millions of chil- 
dren, receive under the first law over £600,000 ($3,000,000). The board schools, 
educating more efficiently some two millions, are under the second measure to 
have only £110,000 ($550,000).
-P-A-G-E-92
    12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
These two laws establish a precedent for special legislation which 
has heretofore been excluded from the system of elementary education. 
A brief summary of previous legislation may serve to show more 
clearly the general bearing of these recent measures. The law of 
1870, the foundation of the system, was also the first by which legal 
provision was made for the education of the whole people. Hitherto 
the elementary schools had been purely private ventures of the most 
desultory sort or the creations of religious societies. The Govern- 
ment had, however, manifested interest in the cause as early as 1833 
by the grant of $100,000, to be distributed through the British and 
Foreign School Society and the National Society. In 1839 a committee 
of council on education was appointed to superintend the distribution, 
and the annual appropriation was increased to $150,000. The develop- 
ment of the system is signally illustrated by the fact that the Educa- 
tion Department distributed above $30,000,000 the present year. 
The principal features of the law of 1870 were (1) the obligation 
assumed by the Government to secure school provision for all chil- 
dren of ages 5 to 14; (2) the recognition or creation of local agencies 
(private or church managers or elected boards) for the execution of 
this purpose; (3) provision for securing efficient instruction by 
means of an annual grant from the treasury to be distributed to the 
local managers upon the results of examination and inspection by 
Government inspectors; (4) the creation of a central agency to carry 
out the provisions on the part of the Government and of new local 
agencies, school boards, which every school district must elect except 
upon satisfactory evidence taat schools efficient and adequate to the 
needs of the district were otherwise providec; (5) the admission of 
private and public elementary schools to a share in the Government 
grant upon the same conditions; (6) the requirements that board 
schools should be strictly nonsectarian and the children of private 
schools protected from enforced sectarian instruction by a conscience 
clause. 
Under the provisions of this law 5,467 board schools have been 
created since 1870, with accommodation for 2,455,289 pupils, and the 
number of private (voluntary) schools increased from 8,798 to 14,479, 
with accommodation for 3,643,380 pupils. 
In 1871, the year after the passage of the education law, the educa- 
tion department issued a code or body of regulations stating precisely 
the conditions upon which a school might share in the Government 
grant; a similar code has been since issued yearly. As these codes 
must be approved by Parliament, they have the binding force of law, 
and may therefore be included in this review. 
The law of 1876 provided additional means for securing school 
attendance. ‘To this end it established school attendance committees 
in districts having no school boards, forbade the employment of chil- 
dren under 14 years of age without proof of certain attainments, and    
   
-P-A-G-E-93
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 13 
  made it the legal obligation of parents to secure the instruction of 
their children in the elementary subjects. In 1896 the population 
under school attendance committees was 9,127,566, and under school 
boards, 19,874,959. 
The law of 1880 went still further in the direction of compulsory 
education. By this, local educational authorities were required to 
make by-laws compelling parents to send their children to school. 
The law of 1891, providing an extra grant in lieu of fees for all schools 
remitting the same, completed the measures for securing universal 
school attendance. In 1893 the age at which a child may obtain total 
or partial exemption from school attendance, provided he has secured 
the educational certificate required by the local by-laws, was raised 
to 11 years. These direet efforts for enforcing and prolonging school 
attendance have been accompanied by changes in the code designed 
to increase both the attractiveness and the efficiency of the schools. 
The codes of 1875 and 1880 greatly extended the list of optional sub- 
jects for which grants could be claimed, and thus laid the foundations 
for the higher grade schools, which have become such an important 
factor in the progress of the larger cities and towns of England. The 
code of 1882 made the first break in the system of payment upon 
results. Individual examination in the elementary subjects was still 
maintained. For these alone a teacher could secure from the grant 
rates varying from 13 to 16 shillings per capita of the children who 
passed. Liberal grants were offered also for attainments in the higher 
subjects. The most important feature introduced by the new regula- 
tions was the “‘merit grant.” This was to be awarded at rates vary- 
ing from 1 to 3 shillings per capita of average attendance, according 
to the report of the inspector as to the general conditions of the 
school—i. e., whether excellent, good, or fair. Inspectors were 
instructed, in making up the report, to consider the special difficulties 
of the teachers, the general intelligence of the district, ete. 
In 1895 the system of annual examinations was radically changed. 
Heretofore the inspectors had made a rigid annual examination of 
every school on the Government list. From this ordeal schools that 
had reached a certain standard were now excused. In place of the 
formal examination there were substituted two annual visits from the 
inspector, the visits to be made without notice. The inspector is to 
test the instruction and the general condition of the school, and from 
the notes taken at the time to make up his report of the school. If 
the report is satisfactory, the school will be entitled to the full grant. 
If further evidence be wanting of the advance in the ideal of popular 
education, it is found in the improved regulations respecting evening 
schools. In 1890 it was first determined that these schools should no 
longer be purely or chiefly elementary in their scope, and in 1893 their 
character as ‘‘evening continuation schools” was distinctly outlined. 
The code of that year offered a wide choice of subjects adapted to the
-P-A-G-E-94
14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  various needs of scholars and districts, and enabled managers to com- 
bine instruction in subjects for which grants are paid by the State 
with instruction in other subjects for which no such grants are paid, 
but which it may be for special reasons desirable to include in the 
curriculum. It suggested, further, a variety of courses of instruction; 
recognized the attendance of persons over 21 years,of age; sanctioned 
the payment of grants for the instruction of the school as a whole 
instead of for the attainments of individual scholars, and made other 
important changes in the methods of awarding the Government grants 
to these schools. 
The effect of this policy may be inferred from the increased attend- 
ance. In 1889 less than 65,000 students availed themselves of the 
provision; in 1896 the number was 298,724. In 1892, the year before 
payments were first allowed for students above 21 years of age, only 
6,617 above that limit were enrolled; in four years the number has 
risen to 35,815. 
This brief survey justifies the belief that the law of 1897, for the 
relief of voluntary schools, and the law increasing grants to the 
poorer school boards were primarily intended to increase the efficiency 
of schools that form an important part of the general system. The 
need of such improvement was recognized alike by Liberals and Con- 
servatives, but as to the proper means of its accomplishment there 
were, as we have seen, grave and bitter differences. 
The system here considered pertains to England and Wales only. 
Scotland secured a general education law in 1872, which conserved 
the best features of the famous parish school system and differed 
from the English law in particulars that show the prevalence in Scot- 
land in the early seventies of a higher ideal of popular education and 
a general preference for public schools. The Scotch law distinctly 
recognized higher grade schools and made the election of school boards 
mandatory for every district. The matter of religious instruction 
was left to the boards, excepting that no child could be constrained 
to attend upon religious instruction. 4 
A Parliamentary grant was allowed as in England, and its provision 
intrusted to a committee of council (education department, Scotland) 
upon like conditions as in England, and under a similar system of 
inspection. The reciprocal action of the two systems has been advan- 
tageous to both. The growth in the English ideal has undoubtedly 
been stimulated by that of Seotland. On the other hand, the neces- 
sity of securing every step by legislative action in the southern 
division of the Kingdom has increased in Scotland activity in the 
same direction. The gap between elementary schools and higher 
institutions, which forms at this moment a serious obstacle to the best 
development of the English system, has never existed in Scotland. 
On the contrary, technical education is more liberally fostered and 
better organized in England than in Scotland.

ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN LONDON. 
Population and school provision.—The magnitude of the educa- 
tional work of London is indicated by the population, which in 1896 
numbered 6,177,913, exceeding that of any one of the United States, 
New York alone excepted. If inner or registration London only be 
included, the population was 4,421,492, which is exceeded by two of 
the United States, viz, New York and Pennsylvania. This vast aggre- 
gate of people represented a school population of 832,966, comprising 
the children between 3 and 13 years of age. The estimate is made on 
the basis of six-sevenths of the total population, one-seventh being 
excluded as the class whose children will not be sent to the elementary 
schools. School accommodation is provided for 754,614 children in 
schools recognized as ‘‘efficient;” that is, entitled to Government aid. 
These are either voluntary (chiefly parochial schools), which provide 
34 per cent of the total number of places, or board schools, that supply 
66 per cent. Since the election of the first school board in 1870, 
immediately after the passage of the elementary school law, the 
school population has increased by 45 per cent. At that time there 
were places in voluntary schools for 261,158, less than one-half the 
population of school age. 
The relative status of the two classes of schools with respect to 
accommodation and attendance in 1896 and the growth from 1870 to 
that year are shown in the following tabulation:

  Of the total enrollment for 1896, 703,371 children were between the 
ages of 3 and 13 and 40,336 were above 13. The sex of children in 
infant schools (number, 261,326) is not reported. Of the older chil- 
dren, 239,274 were boys and 238,330 were girls. 
The foregoing statistics indicate in a measure the work achieved by 
the school board in twenty-six years in the mere matter of providing  
-P-A-G-E-96
16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  schools. At the end of 1896 the board had 402 schools open and 153 
in process of construction. The selection and purchase of sites has 
been one of the most difficult tasks imposed upon the board and 
explains in part the charges of extravagance by which it is hampered. 
Although immense progress has been made in overcoming the school 
deficiency that existed in 1870, the supply of school places is still 
nearly 80,000 below the number of school children. As, however, will 
appear from further statements, a part of this deficiency is counter- 
balanced by the children unable to attend school. 
General character of voluntary schools.—The voluntary schools are 
chiefly parochial, but some few are under private management, as, 
for instance, the Jews’ free school, probably the largest school in the 
world, maintained by Baron de Rothschild. This school, situated in 
the midst of the district where the poorer Jewish immigrants congre- 
gate, has accommodation for 2,250 boys and 1,250 girls. It is one of 
the most efficient schools in London, as shown by the large annual 
grant which it secures upon the results of the Government examina- 
tion. Besides tuition, breakfasts are provided every morning and 
each child is given a suit of clothes and two pairs of shoes yearly. A _ 
savings bank is connected with the school which pays. the pupils 10 
per cent on small deposits. 
Beyond the statistics already given, official information respecting 
the voluntary schools is seldom attainable. The further statements 
in this chapter relate to the schools under the school board. 
Constitution and powers of the school board.—This body is elected 
by all the rate payers (women included) for a term of three years. It 
comprises 55 members, organized in ten or eleven standing commit- 
tees, and employing a permanent staff of about 450 officers and clerks. 
Besides the salaried officers, there are local managers, to whom the 
board delegates certain supervisory functions. These local managers, 
numbering about 2,000, are appointed upon the nomination of the 
divisional committees. They usually retain office, if they will, as 
long as they make a minimum number of visits to the schools. Asa 
rule, three schools are placed under one group of managers. The 
local managers nominate the assistant teachers, and also take part in 
the selection and nomination of the head teachers. 
Within the restrictions of the education law (1870, and subsequent 
amendments), which limits the powers of the school boards simply in 
respect to the conditions as to equipment, attendance, and efficiency 
required for participation in the parliamentary grant, the board has 
absolute authority with respect to the schools. It chooses and pur- 
chases sites, appoints teachers, and determines their qualifications and 
salaries, and may claim or levy taxes (rates on the taxable property) 
to meet the current expenses in excess of the amount derived from 
the annual grants or other sources of permanent income. 
The responsibility of the board is not limited simply to the care of the
-P-A-G-E-97
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 17 
children upon the schoolrolls. Itrests with them to ascertain the status 
of the entire school population and to deal with all cases of truant and 
neglected children. To facilitate their general supervision of the 
children of school age, the city is divided into 11 divisions, for whose 
inspection the board employs 10 divisional superintendents (city and 
Westminister counting as one division for the enforcement of by- 
laws), 11 assistants to superintendents, 289 district visitors, 11 street 
visitors, and a special visitor for Italian children for three days in the 
week to serve in the Finsbury division. A staff of clerks keeps up 
the office work entailed by the supervision. 
Children not on school rolls.—In 1896 the number of children between 
the ages of 3 and 13 who were not upon the rolls of efficient schools 
was 124,971. These children were accounted for in detail, as follows: 
Three thousand four hundred and forty-one under instruction in some 
other way, viz, 1,213 receiving efficient instruction at home and 2,228 
attending schools not recognized as efficient. Of those who were not 
receiving instruction at all 96,628 were under 5 years of age, and con- 
sequently could not be compelled to attend school. The remaining 
children, numbering 24,902, comprised those exempt from attendance, 
those permanently disabled, absent in the country, children ill or 
delicate, exposed at home to infectious diseases, those kept from 
school through insufficient accommodation, under surveillance by the 
provincial committees, and a few others not classified. 
Tt is the duty of street visitors to look up the whereabouts of every 
child of school age not found at school, and the causes of absence are 
thoroughly investigated. The report of children absent from school 
during the single week ending September 4, 1896, was as follows:

Nore.—In 1895 the total and grand total were 52,015 and 67,364, respectively. 
  During the year 301 children were given into custody by the visitors. 
Of these, 184 were sent to an industrial school (these correspond to our 
reform schools), 82 were discharged, in 11 cases the parents were bound 
over, 3 children were sent to the workhouse, 11 were referred back to 
the board, 1 was found to be physically unfit for admission to an 
industrial school, and the remainder were otherwise dealt with. 
Schools for vagrant and truant children.—The board has two indus- 
trial schools where children found begging, or destitute, or keeping

company with thieves are sent—one at Brentford, for 100 boys, and 
the other, the Shaftesbury industrial training ship, for 500 boys. 
There are also two truant schools and a day industrial school. A 
house has recently been acquired for a girls’ industrial school. 
The board has also secured 1,005 places (870 for boys and 135 for 
girls) in voluntary industrial schools, of which there are 36, with 
accommodation for 8,333 children. There are also voluntary truant 
schools, with provision for 165 pupils. Altogether there are 9,638 
places in industrial and truant schools for the special care of vicious 
or incorrigible children. The expenditure for these schools in 1896 
reached $235,000. 
Causes of a a attendance.—Complaint is made that the efforts 
of the board to secure regular attendance are not adequately seconded 
by the magistrates, and in general that the means of dealing with 
truant children are unsatisfactory. 
Under ordinary circumstances complete exemption from school 
attendance may not be granted for any child under 13 years of age, 
and in the case of children over 13 complete exemption can not be 
granted unless it is proved that the child has made 350 attendances 
annually during five of the six years immediately preceding. With 
all the efforts that are put forth itis admitted that ‘‘the degree of regu- 
larity of attendances at which the board aims has not yet been reached.” 
Many causes in the metropolis militate against the attainment of a 
high percentage of average attendance. Of these the following are 
cited: The poverty of large masses of the population; the migratory 
character of the population; the stringency of the board’s regulations 
with regard to infectious diseases; the lack of sufficient and proper 
facilities for prosecutions for nonattendance at school. 
Classification of pupils by grade.—With respect to studies the clas- 
sification of pupils in the board schools was as follows in 1896: 
  
| Percent- age of 
children 
in each 
grade ex- clusive of 
“below

Total (inclusive of those below grade 1)     The obligatory studies and the standards of each grade are fixed by 
the education department, and are applicable to all schools under Gov- 
ernment inspection. The obligatory subjects are reading, writing,

and arithmetic, with drawing for boys and needlework for girls; also 
object lessons in the three lower grades. In addition to these subjects 
the programmes include class subjects, one of which must be taken by 
the older pupils, and specific subjects. The latter would be counted 
high-school studies in this country. The reports do not give the 
precise number of pupils taking either the class or specific subjects, 
but the tabulated results of the examinations here presented indicate 
the number approximately.

Lixtent of gratuitous provision.—The board has remitted all fees in 
the day schools and supplies school books, apparatus, and stationery 
free of charge to the pupils. Pianos are provided in the halls of 57 
schools, to assist in the music drills given to children. There are 
scholars’ lending libraries at every permanent school. Suitable books 
for children are lent free, to encourage a love of reading. Thrift is 
fostered by the establishment of penny banks at the schools. 
The teaching corps.—The teaching staff of the board schools in the 
year under review had reached a total of 10,695, classified as follows:   Adult teachers. Pupil teachers.

Evening schools.—Evening schools, opened first by the board in 
1882, have been greatly developed under the new regulations issued 
by the education department in 1893. 
In accordance with the new programmes the name is changed to 
evening continuation schools, which indicates the wider and freer 
scope of their work. Particulars of these schools and of other special 
departments of the board’s work are included in the statement of the 
chairman of the finance committee quoted below. 
Finances.—The expenditure by the board in 1896 reached the sum 
of $11,722,360, of which amount about 75 per cent was derived from 
the local tax. The adjustment of this tax is the most difficult of all 
the responsibilities resting upon the board, and is the point against 
which the advocates of parochial schools direct their criticism with 
most telling effect. During the year under review the cries of extray- 
agance were specially pronounced, and had much to do in bringing 
about the clause in the defeated education bill providing for a veto 
on school-board expenditure by some external authority. 
It is admitted even by those thoroughly in sympathy with the work 
of the board that the annual increase of expenditure calls for special 
attention. 
The chairman of the finance committee in presenting estimates for 
the current year submitted an exhaustive analysis of the conditions 
of the problem, and while recognizing that items of new expenditure 
must continually arise, urged that the board should exercise greater 
control over the action of its standing committees. The statement as 
a whole is of importance only to the rate payers of London, but many 
particulars have a general interest because they disclose the workings 
of one of the chief school systems of the world. 
The chairman stated that— 
The estimates passed by the various committees, and approved by the board, 
for the year ended March 25, 1896, amounted to $11,364,810; the approximate 
expenditure amounted to $11,722,360, or an excess of expenditure over estimate of 
$357,550. With the accounts of so large a work as thatof this board, items of new 
expenditure must of necessity arise from time to time. New work arises in vari- 
ous ways. Firstly, it is imposed upon the board by Parliament (this was the case 
when the board had to take over from the poor-law boards the care and the main- 
tenance of the deaf and blind children; work such as this has to be undertaken 
whether the board like it or no). Secondly, the board itself occasionally seek new 
powers, as in the case of manual training and laundry classes, but in all cases 
that come under these two heads the liability on the board’s finance can be fore- 
seen and provided for. Thirdly, there is work arising from an outbreak of an
-P-A-G-E-101
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 21 
epidemic,'etc., or a defect or failure in the sanitary arrangements. This class is 
practically the only one that entails work that must be proceeded with so soon as 
the necessity is demonstrated, and yet which could not have been foreseen. 
Fourthly, there is another class of new expenditure which is almost invariably 
extensive and costly in character; i.e., the alteration of internal fittings to schools, 
the supply of a more elaborate apparatus, and new methods of organizing the 
schools. This class of expenditure, however, is completely under the control of the 
committees in charge of the work, and should never be commenced until the board 
have had an opportunity of providing the necessary funds. When I come to 
examine into the cause of this overexpenditure of $357,550, I find that no excess 
upon estimate has arisen under the first three heads, but that the excess is mainly 
due to the last class of expenditure; i. e., expenditure over which the committees 
have full power of control, both as regards time of execution and amount of work 
to be executed. 
The gross cost per capita of average attendance for the successive 
years 1893 to 1896 was shown to be as follows:

1893 $18.60 1894 19.54 
      
These rates are below the average of our own cities, in which the 
per capita ranges generally from $20 to $35.

years and the steady increase during the period: :

The yearly increase in expenditure brings an increased levy on the 
local taxes, which, for the year ending March 25, 1897, it was estimated 
must furnish £1,800,926 ($9,004,630), equivalent to a tax of 12.31 pence 
in the pound! (equivalent to 5 cents ona dollar). This was an increase 
of 0.82 pence over the rate of the previous year, and is the highest 
assessment yet reached. 
  
1 The London rate, which, as shown above, is about a shilling in the pound, exceeds 
the average rate for the country by about three half pence in the pound. Froma 
statement in the Schoolmaster for September 4, 1897, it appears that in 20 per cent 
of the English boroughs, in 17 per cent of the English parishes, in 8.7 per cent of 
the Welsh boroughs, and in 23.4 per cent of the Welsh parishes the school board 
rate amounts to a shilling or above, the actual number of boards falling into the 
list being 440. Out of the 56 county boroughs 2 reach the London rate, viz, 
Coventry and York, and 18 exceed it. Among the latter are included Birming- 
ham, Leeds, Leicester, Norwich, Nottingham, and Sheffield. Nineteen municipal 
boroughs also exceed the London rate.

In his estimates for the year 1896-97 the chairman shows an increase 
of $325,000 for teachers’ salaries, which includes $100,000 for teachers 
in new schools, $25,000 for unattached teachers and special teachers 
for French, and ‘‘hand and eye” training in higher grade schools. 
Other special items are thus explained by the chairman: 
The training of the indusirial faculties of students, including deaf and dumb, 
during the past year cost the board £62,546 ($312,730). As this work is increas- 
ing, the estimate of £58,700 ($293,500) of last year has been increased to £76,000 
($380,000) for the current financial year. This amount is undoubtedly getting 
very large, but I venture to think there is no expenditure of the board that will 
be more willingly borne by the rate payers than this burden which, as much as 
any other portion of the board’s work, tends to increase the usefulness and value 
of the future citizens. I find that cookery instruction cost £19,000 ($95,000); that 
the laundry work cost £6,700 ($88,500), and that manual training cost £19,500 
($97,500). The cost of the schools for the special instruction of mentally defective 
children was £4,900 ($24,500). The instruction of the deaf, including the sum of 
£2,496 ($12,480) for maintenance of children taken over from the poor-law authori- 
ties, was £7,717 ($38,585); and the instruction of the blind, including the sum of 
£2,209 ($11,045) for boarding out 76 children, cost the rates £3,106 ($15,530). The 
cost of the maintenance of these children amounted to £4,705 ($23,525), and the 
contributions received from the parents toward the cost of maintenance of the 
children has amounted to £301 ($1,505). 
I must again ask the board to bestow more than usual care upon the working of 
the act relating to these poor children, for, although the advantages to.society, by 
enabling these otherwise helpless members of society to become helpful and useful 
members, must be very great and the money spent upon this object well laid out, 
the feeling of the perpetual responsibility for the proper care and maintenance of 
their offspring should be lessened as little as possible, and every care should be 
taken that, while not making the act unduly oppressive, contributions in accord- 
ance with the means of the parents should be insisted upon. The evening con- 
tinuation schools have been making good progress during the past year, the
-P-A-G-E-103
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 23 
average attendance having increased from 13,976 to 15,761. This, however, must 
not be taken as indicating the number of students attending these classes, as a 
large number only attend on one evening in the week, which, consequently, only 
counts as one-third in average attendance. The books have not been fully made 
up, but when they are the number of students who have, for longer or shorter 
periods, made attendances at these classes will be found to be very little less than 
50,000. The cost of these classes for the current financial year is estimated at 
£45,650 ($228,250), which will allow for a large increase in the average attendance. 
As to the work of building necessary to keep pace with the ever- 
growing population the chairman says: 
The additions in the shape of increased space now required, enlarged apparatus, 
and greater conveniences for each scholar over what was formerly the case must 
largely add to the cost per head. During the year tenders have been accepted for 
erecting 11 new schools and enlarging 17 others, and finished plans have been pro- 
vided for 8 new schools and 9 other enlargements, besides a large number of cook- 
ery, laundry, manual training, housewifery centers, and schools for special instruc- 
tions and the teaching of upper standards. I am glad, however, to see that the 
erection of iron buildings for temporary schools is on the decrease, as this is one 
of the most expensive items in connection with day schools. 
It should be observed that the funds for the purchase of sites and 
the erection of buildings are borrowed by the board from the public 
works loan commissioners, in accordance with the provisions of the 
education law. During the year 1895-96 the sum of $3,000,000 was 
borrowed for this purpose, and the outstanding balance of the debt 
owed by the board on this account March 25, 1896, was $43,144,378. 
PROVISION FOR SECONDARY AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The foregoing statement, which relates wholly to elementary schools, 
conveys no idea of the provision that exists in London for continuing 
the education of the people into secondary and higher courses, except- 
ing as these are represented in the class and specific subjects of the 
elementary programme. There are, however, numerous agencies, 
public and private, devoted to this purpose. 
The most important of the public agencies is the technical educa- 
tion board. Under the technical education laws of 1889 and 1890 a 
local authority, such as the London County Council, may support 
manual instruction in schools and other institutions which are within 
its districts or in outside districts accessible to its students. The aid 
must not be given to schools conducted for private profit or for pupils 
in the elementary grade, hence its work is essentially public and of 
secondary or higher grade. The London County Council has dele- 
gated its powers in these respects to the technical education board. 
The funds at the disposal of the board are applied in two ways: 
First, in providing scholarships; second, directly to institutions for 
laboratories, equipment, and special departments, or to meet the sal- 
aries of teachers of science, art, manual training, domestic economy, 
and commercial subjects in various schools.

The system of scholarships established by the board comprises the 
following: 
(a) Junior county scholarships.—Commencing with children leaving public ele- 
mentary schools after passing the sixth standard, the board has established a num- 
ber of junior county scholarships, of which 600 are awarded every year. These 
scholarships include free education at certain secondary or higher-grade schools 
approved by the board, together with money payments in lieu of the wages which 
might otherwise be earned by the scholars, amounting during the first year to $40 
and during the second year to $60, the scholarships being ordinarily tenable for 
two years. y 
* * * * * * * 
Candidates must be under 13 years of age on the first day of the month in which 
the examination is held. They must have lived in London for at least one year 
previously to the award of the scholarship, and their parents or guardians must 
be in receipt of not more than $750 per annum, or, in the case of weekly wages, 
not more than $15 per week from all sources. 
In 1895, the total number of candidates competing for the junior scholarships 
was 3,794 (2,337 boys, 1,457 girls) ; 1,829 passed, and 612 scholarships were awarded. 
The candidates came from 407 schools, of which 280 were board schools, 107 volun- 
tary schools, and 20 secondary schools. 
(6) The intermediate county scholarships established by the board are open to 
boys and girls under 16, who come from any school, secondary or upper standard. 
They give free education till the scholar is between 18 and 19, together with money 
paymentsrising from $100 to $175 a year, andare limited to candidates whose parents 
are.in receipt of an income of not more than $2,000. They are tenable at public 
secondary schools or places of higher learning, and nearly all the leading schools 
of London, besides University College and Bedford College, have now some of the 
board’s intermediate scholars in attendance. The board awarded 50 of these 
scholarships in 1894 and 70 in 1895. 
(c) The senior county scholarships are intended to provide for a few specially 
promising students a training of university rank. Open as a rule only to persons 
under 19 years of age, they give free tuition ata college or technical institute, 
together with money payments of $300 a year, tenable for three years. The income 
limit for the parents is the same as for the intermediate county scholarships, viz, 
$2,000 a year. The board has hitherto awarded five of these scholarships a year, 
put in 1895 it awarded in addition seven “‘exhibitions” of varying values to candi- 
dates who were not successful in obtaining scholarships. 
The board also offers each year a certain number of scholarships 
and prize funds in science and art to older candidates who have 
already entered into some industrial career as apprentices or skilled 
artisans. These include 20 scholarships of the annual value of $100 
each, together with payment of tuition fees, tenable for two years. 
These scholarships are intended for students who will study in day 
schools of art. > 
Twenty artisan art scholarships, of the annual value of $100 each, 
together with payment of tuition fees, tenable for two years in the 
first instance but renewable fora third year. 'These scholarships are 
confined to those who are actually engaged in some trade requiring 
artistic handicraft. 
One hundred prizes (exhibitions), of the value of $25 each, tenable 
fortwo years. These are intended to pay the traveling and incidental
-P-A-G-E-105
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 25 
  expenses of students who wish to carry on their art studies in the 
evenings; also an equal number of prize funds of the same value, ten- 
able in evening schools of science and technology. 
In addition to the above scholarships, in 1895 the board awarded 814 
scholarships in domestic economy, enabling girls to go through a five- 
months’ course of training in cookery, dressmaking, and laundry 
work at the schools of domestic economy started by the board at 
several polytechnics and other centers. There are also awarded 12 
training scholarships in domestic economy, tenable at the Battersea 
Polytechnic School of Domestic Economy for training teachers, and 
two horticultural scholarships, of the value of $300 a year for two 
years, tenable at the Swanley Horticultural College, Kent—one for 
men and one for women. 
From the fourth annual report of the work covering the year 
1895-96, it appears that the technical education board continues its 
policy of seeking to coordinate existing institutions and to increase 
their provision for technical education. 
There are now no fewer than 98 separate institutions in Londén to 
a greater or less extent supported by the board and inspected by its 
officers. 
Special attention has been paid to developing instruction for appren- 
tices, improyers, and journeymen in the principal London industries. 
More than 200 well-equipped and efficient centers of practical instruc- 
tion in various trades are now under the supervision of the board. 
The character of the instruction given differs slightly, but, on the 
whole, it is of a kind that will assist industrial progress. As to 
instruction in electrical engineering, it is stated as a noteworthy fact 
that from 16 to 18 students from the Royal College of Science have 
been attending the evening classes for electrical engineers at the 
Southwest London Polytechnic Institute. This may be taken as good 
evidence of the polytechnic’s efficiency. 
London now has: 11 polytechnic institutions, which have on their 
rolls probably not fewer than 40,000 separate members or students. 
Nearly all the polytechnics provide instruction in science, art, tech- 
nology, commercial subjects, literary subjects, and domestic economy; 
and during the session 1895-96, before the Northampton Institute and 
the Northern Polytechnic were opened, the students registered at the 
London polytechnics, including the People’s Palace and the Gold- 
smiths’ Institute, in the several departments, were: 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The 11 polytechnic institutes, according to the official report, may 
be estimated for the current session 1896-97 to be spending in all 
their departments a total of about $640,000 per annum, of which, 
roughly speaking, $145,000 will probably be provided by the city 
parochial trustees, $125,000 by the technical education board, $110,000 
from city companies, $60,000 from private subscriptions and other 
endowments, $45,000 from Government grants, and $150,000 from 
students’ fees, etc. The total capital expenditure can only be roughly 
guessed at, but it will certainly have exceeded $2,500,000. They may 
be expected to have in 1897-98 a total of about 45,000 separate students 
in all subjects, as compared with a corresponding total for 1892-93 of 
not more than 20,000. 
The development of the higher departments at several of the poly- 
technics has during the last two or three years greatly increased the 
provision of higher instruction, especially in engineering, chemistry, 
and physics. In the new and well-equipped laboratories now pro- 
vided at these institutions by means of the board’s equipment grants, 
facilities are given for the student to pursue his work without a break 
from the elements of the subject up to the highest branches, and to 
undertake, in conjunction with his teacher, original investigation and 
research. A considerable addition has thus been made to the instruc- 
tion of distinctly university rank now accessible to the London 
student, and it is estimated that, in addition to a large number pre- 
paring for matriculation, there are now over 100 matriculated stu- 
dents in the polytechnics who are definitely studying for London 
University degrees in science. This number constitutes no small 
proportion of the total of matriculated students for science degrees, 
other than those in the medical schools, who are studying in organized 
educational institutes in London. 
This great development of instruction of university rank in new 
institutions has increased the importance of bringing about a more 
systematic coordination of university education in London. The board 
has accordingly continued to press for the early establishment of the 
promised new teaching university for London, toward the technical 
departments of which it is proposed the board should contribute. As 
ameans of coordinating the different institutions providing university 
instruction in technical subjects, arrangements are in progress for 
courses of intercollegiate lectures, mainly in post-graduate and spe- 
cialist subjects, which will be open to all students of the various 
institutions concerned. 
Commenting upon the report, the London Globe says: 
A special difficulty in the building trades is the indisposition of London employ- 
ers to take boys into their service, either as apprentices or without any arrange- 
ments for their instruction. The inquiry made by the board in 1895 showed that 
41 typical firms in various branches of the building trades, having 12,000 employees, 
had only 80 apprentices and 143 “learners,” instead of 1,600, which would have 
been about the normal proportion. The London building trades are, in fact,
-P-A-G-E-107
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 27 
mainly recruited from the country. The result is not only that great difficulty is 
experienced by boys in obtaining situations where they can learn any branch of 
the building trade, but also that in the absence of the normal proportion of boys 
and young men the establishment of successful trade classes has been a specially 
onerous task. But the difficulties are now being overcome. The present session 
has seen a large increase in the number of students in building-trade subjects, 
there being over a thousand entries in building construction at the polytechnics 
alone, mainly by carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, masons, architects’ assistants, 
and builders’ clerks. The number of artisans attending classes in practical plane 
and solid geometry also shows an increase. There are now classes in building 
construction, architectural drawing, quantity surveying, and workshop drawing 
at 87 centers; in practical geometry and geometrical drawing at 40 centers, and 
in technical mensuration at 6 centers. 
  The infiuence of the board in promoting a high order of scientific 
training is shown particularly in the work of the polytechnics. 
According to a statement in Nature of June 10— 
These institutions aremoving toward a higher educational status than they occu- 
pied a few yearsago. The courses of study are systematized, and they are super- 
vised by teachers who have had laboratory experience, and hence they educate the 
mind as well as train the hand. An announcement that in the next session 
(1897-98) Principal Tomlinson, F. R. S., of the Southwest London Polytechnic, 
will establish a class for training in research affords an instance of the higher tend- 
ency of polytechnic instruction. This research training will form part of the cur- 
riculum of the second-year day electrical engineering students of the institute, 
but will be open to a limited number of other students, provided they can show a 
fair knowledge of the elementary principles of physics and mathematics. The 
method of conducting any research will be as follows: The principal will first 
select some subject for investigation suitable for electrical engineering students. 
He will then fully explain to the class the various reasons which have induced 
him to make the selection and will give a brief history of what has been previ- 
ously done round and about the subject and full reference thereto. He will also 
propound a mode or modes of attacking the research and invite criticisms from 
the class. When the best mode of attack has been decided on, the class will be 
expected not only to take part in the experiments, but to help in preparing the 
required apparatus. Should the results obtained be of sufficient importance, they 
will be offered in the form of a paper to such societies as the Royal Society, the 
Physical Society, or the Institution of Electrical Engineers. From time to time 
during the investigations the principal will give demonstrations or lectures on 
those particular branches of magnetism and electricity which bear directly on the 
investigation and will illustrate them by the results obtained. The subject selected 
for the first research is ‘‘The effect of repeated heating on the magnetic perme- 
ability and electrical conductivity of iron and steel.”

CONSPECTUS OF THE STATE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION, OR UNIVERSITY 
OF FRANCE. 
  France has a highly centralized system of education under a cabinet 
officer, the minister of public instruction and fine arts.’ Itis organized 
in three departments (superior, secondary, and primary), each under its 
own director. The minister is assisted by the superior council of public 
instruction, composed of eminent representatives of the three orders of 
instruction, 60 in number, one-fourth appointed by the President of 
the Republic and the remainder chosen by their peers. This council 
is the deliberative head of the university system. In certain cases of 
discipline affecting professors and teachers its decisions are final. The 
administration of the system is facilitated by its division into acade- 
mies, 17 in number, each of which comprises, under the general 
direction of a rector (appointed by the minister), all the public insti- 
tutions, i. e., primary schools, lycées, colleges, and universities of the 
respective districts. The rector must be a university man, holding 
the doctor’s degree. By recent decrees and the law of July 10, 1896, 
the former State faculties have been transformed into universities. 
The State continues to appoint all professors and university officials, 
to prescribe requirements for admission and for degree examinations, 
to regulate fees, and to confer diplomas. The authority of the uni- 
versity, exercised through a council consisting of the academic rector, 
the deans of the several faculties, and two professors elected from 
each faculty, extends only to the adjustment of programmes, the con- 
trol of students, of the income from tuition fees, and of the university 
property. Fifteen universities have been constituted under the law. 
To the department of superior instruction belong also special schools; 
one of these, the superior normal school, is designed to prepare pro- 
fessors for the service of higher education. 
The department of secondary instruction comprises the lyeées or 
State classical colleges (in number 109) and communal colleges (227) 
maintained by the combined aid of the State and local authorities. 
The professors in both classes of schools are appointed by the minis- 
ter from candidates possessed of the university diplomas. Their 
salaries are paid by the State. 
The scholastic and domestic affairs of the lyeées (they are both board- 
ing and day schools) are controlled by the minister and superior coun- 
cil. They have a double course, classical and modern, the former 
leading to the bachelors’ degree. The studies of the local colleges are 
conformed as far as possible to the lycée programme. The State main- 
tains also lyecées and colleges for girls and a special normal school 
(Sévres) to prepare professors for the same. The 86 civil departments 
of France (90 if Algiers, be included) form also districts of educa- 
tional administration within the academies. In the chief city of each   
‘Present minister, M. Rambaud, who succeeded M. Combes April 29, 1896.
-P-A-G-E-111
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 31 
  resides an official (inspecteur d’académie), charged under the orders 
of the rector with the supervision of secondary instruction. 
The department of primary instruction includes maternal schools, 
elementary primary and superior primary schools, and departmental 
normal schools. 
The law of 1833 laid the foundation of the system by imposing upon 
communes the obligation to establish public schools. Under the 
Republic the system has been developed through legislation, an effi- 
cient central supervision, and substantial appropriations from the 
Government. 
By law of June 16, 1881, primary instruction is gratuitous, and 
teachers must be provided with State diplomas: (brevets de capacité). 
By law of March 28, 1882, primary education is compulsory (attend- 
ance upon private schools or home instruction meets the requirement), 
and public primary schools purely secular. By law of October 30, 
1886, the studies and organization of the several classes of schools are 
determined and only lay teachers admitted to the service. By laws of 
June 19, 1889, and July 25, 1893, the State assumes the payment of 
the legal salaries. Communes provide residences for teachers and 
supplement the salaries. The teachers are appointed by the depart- 
mental prefect from lists of candidates offered by the departmental 
councils. These councils are composed of members of the superior 
council and directors of primary schools. They exercise advisory, 
and in certain cases judicial, functions in respect to primary schools. 
For the service of primary instruction there is a graded series of 
State inspectors appointed by the minister, comprising (1) general 
inspectors, assigned each to a particular section, inspectors of special 
branches, inspectresses of maternal schools; (2) the ‘‘inspecteurs 
@académie,” who conduct the examinations for teachers’ diplomas 
and have the general direction of primary schools; (3) primary in- 
spectors, about 450 in number, one for every 150 schools; (4) medical 
inspectors. 
The communal authorities have the chief voice in the choice of 
sites, buildings, etc., the mayors of communes have free access to the 
schools at all times, and local committees are appointed to keep 
watch over the schools. The communes must provide a fund (caisse 
des écoles) for the aid of indigent pupils. Every department must 
maintain a primary normal school for men and one for women, unless 
authorized to combine the two. Among the special schools comprised 
in the department of superior instruction the State maintains two 
normal schools (Saint Cloud for men, Fontenay-aux-Roses for women) 
to prepare teachers for the departmental normals. 
The authority of the minister of public instruction extends, in a 
measure, also to private institutions of all grades. He grants the 
privilege of conducting private schools, which must conform to offi- 
cial requirements in respect to sanitary and hygienic conditions.

DEPARTMENT OF SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
  The universities.—The system of public instruction in France, which 
has maintained to the present time the chief features of the organi- 
zation created by Napoleon, shows a continuance of the decentralizing 
movements that have been noticed in the Commissioner’s previous 
reports. These movements are most marked in the department of 
superior instruction, comprising the universities and the speciat 
schools that are under the control of the minister of public instruction. 
Prior to the revolution France possessed 22 universities, several of 
which, and notably Toulouse and Montpellier, were only less celebrated 
than the University of Paris. The suppression of these institutions 
was one of the most extraordinary acts of the revolutionary govern- 
ment, both in itsimmediate and remote effects. From that time higher 
education in France took a new direction; general culture gave way to 
specialization. This tendency suited well with the policy of Napoleon, 
who fostered military, polytechnic, and other special schools that pre- 
pared men for his immediate service, but jealously repressed alt 
agencies favorable to freedom of thought and action. The faculties 
that he created had no independent life. They were simply parts of 
the ‘‘ university,” whose function it was to examine and to confer the 
State diplomas upon aspirants from the lycées and special schools. 
It is true that almost immediately after the suppression of the univer- 
sities, medical instruction was found essential, and schools of health 
(écoles de santé) were established the year following that act (1794). 
ED 97-—3  
-P-A-G-E-114
34 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  These schools were included by Napoleon among faculties in the decree 
of 1808, organizing the university. The same necessity gave rise to 
schools of medicine. These, created by physicians or municipalities, 
were in time brought under the imperial control, and became equiva- 
lent to, or appendages of, the faculties of medicine. Even in the Paris 
faculties, which never lost entirely their esprit de corps, teaching 
functions were not revived until 1823, when the medical faculty was 
reorganized and increased by the addition of 36 special professors 
(agrégés), whose duty it was toimpart systematic instruction to medi- 
cal students. In 1838 the faculty of law declared that every professor 
in that body ought to give at least three lessons a week. In 1840 
an effort was made, at the instigation of Cousin, to create a teaching 
service in the faculties of letters and of science. 
The importance of the teaching service has been fully recognized 
under the Republic, but its development in the faculties of letters 
and of science has been slow, and until a very recent date has bene- 
fited only candidates for the licentiate or for the examination for the 
title of agrégé (agrégation), essential, one or the other, for appoint- 
ment as a professor in the lycées or secondary schools. Between 
1875 and 1887-88 the number of students in the faculties increased 
from 9,963 to 17,630. In commenting on this fact, M. Falliéres, min- 
ister of public instruction at the latter.date, said: “‘In this increase 
there figure two entirely new categories of students—the student of 
science and the student of letters. No further back than 1876 these 
were so few, that they were not mentioned. At present our 2,358 
students of letters and our 1,335 students of sciences are real stu- 
dents—permanent pupils of the faculties.” The 27,035 students 
enrolled in 1896 included 6,507 in the faculties specified (letters 3,457, 
sciences 3,050). 
Parallel with this movement, and in some degree an outcome from 
it, has been that for transforming the several faculties into organic 
bodies having a measure of independence and free initiative. 
The culmination of the successive measures looking to this result is 
the law of last year (July 10, 1896), conferring the title of university 
upon the faculties. Each university is to have a council, consisting 
of the rector, the deans of the faculties, and two delegates from each 
faculty elected triennially by the professors. This council, subject 
in certain cases to the approval of the superior council of public 
instruction, will have control over the teaching, discipline, and prop- 
erty of the university. Since, however, the State will continue to 
appoint all professors and to pay their salaries, the ecuncil will have 
merely advisory power with respect to appointments and the creation, 
abolition, or modification of professorships, and with respect also to 
the income of the university. The maintenance of buildings will be 
the care of the university and must be defrayed from fees or endow- 
ments. The State will take the fees for examinations and State

  diplomas, but all other fees will go to the university treasury. In 
accordance with the law, fifteen universities have been constituted in 
France. These must now depend largely upon the fees of students 
and the local resources which they can command, in which respects 
they present very unequal conditions. The annual receipts of Paris 
. University are estimated at about $120,000; of Lyons, at $26,000. 
Besangon has not more than $140 and Clermont $160. Evidently, 
unless the smaller universities secure subsidies from the departments 
or municipalities, they will not be able to support the character which 
the law has imposed upon them. That this is clearly recognized is 
indicated by the addresses at the inaugural ceremonies which occurred 
at the opening of the winter semester. 
At Paris the occasion was not marked by unusual festivities, for 
indeed the Paris faculties are not so deeply affected by the new law 
as those outside of the capital. The title which the law confers has 
never been entirely lost to this group, and the powers which it sane- 
tions had been already conferred by a series of decrees dating back to 
1885. [Decrees of July 25 and of December 28, 1885, empowering 
the faculties to hold and manage property, and constituting councils 
with powers similar to those conferred upon the university councils; 
decree of February 21, 1890, conferring the control of their resources 
and the management of their internal affairs, and law of April 28, 
1893, conferring civil personality upon the faculties, and subsequent 
decrees, August 9 and 10, determining their financial and adminis- 
trative powers. | 
In his report for the year 1896, M. Gréard, president of the Paris 
council, reviews the history of the decade, showing the development 
inspired by the recent measures. The material equipment of the 
university has been greatly improved by the erection of new build- 
ings and the reconstruction of the old. The new Sorbonne is the 
home of the faculties of letters and science. The faculty of law has 
its building remodeled. The faculty of medicine has new quarters 
and its laboratory facilities have been greatly increased. 
Many new chairs have been created—2 in the faculty of Protestant 
theology, 7 in that of law, 2 in the faculty of sciences, 4 in letters, 1 
in pharmacy, and the scope of the faculty of medicine has been 
enlarged by four complete courses. Besides these professorships 
there have been added many supplementary courses and lectures. 
The municipality has contributed liberally to this increase of mate- 
rial and scholastic resources. It is noticeable also that private bene- 
factors have borne some part in the enrichment of this university. 
The Count de Chambrun has provided funds for a course in sociology; 
the city has endowed a chair of the history of the French revolution 
in the faculty of letters and in the faculty of sciences a chair of the 
evolution of organized beings. Besides these foundations about thirty 
private legacies and donations have been received for the creation of    
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
prizes and scholarships. The belief is expressed that henceforth the 
generosity of individuals, by which the ‘‘institute” has long been 
favored, will find its way also to the university. 
The additions to the university library have increased also year by 
year. In 1885-86 the number of volumes secured by purchase or gift 
was 5,430; in 1894-95 it was 13,604. The use of the library has 
increased proportionately. For 75,000 volumes consulted or borrowed 
in 1885 there were more than 100,000 in 1895. 
Parallel with this growth has been that in the number of students, 
which rose from 10,679 in 1885 to 14,000 in 1895. In the latter num- 
ber were included about 1,500 foreigners from Russia, Roumania, 
Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and the United States. The report 
dwells also upon the several measures that have been adopted by the 
Government, upon advice with the faculties, intended to make instruc- 
tion more thorough, to cultivate in the students more and more the 
habit and the passion for the scientific method, and in general to 
raise the standard of scholarship and to provide for the more com- 
plete mastery of special subjects. 
In several universities of the provinces the opening ceremonies 
were brilliant and impressive. 
This was particularly the case at Lyons, which ranks next to Paris, 
and of which the rector, Dr. Compayré, said in the inaugural address, 
“Tf Paris is without a peer, Lyons, with its 2,200 students, is without 
a companion.” 
Lyons has indeed contributed greatly to the restoration of the 
university name and state. The campaign inaugurated in 1889 by 
the ‘Société des Amis de Université” was nowhere more vigorously 
pressed than at this university seat. The efforts were not confined 
to the professors. The cause was ardently espoused by the press and 
the people, who elected councilors pledged to its support. The spirit 
spread throughout the region and was active in the smaller towns, 
notably at Bourg and at Puy. The chambers of commerce, industrial 
associations, and learned societies were all united in the endeavor. 
As the first fruits of the law so ardently desired, Dr. Compayré noted 
the gift of $20,000 from a benefactor of the restored university. The 
students’ association, which took its impulse from the spirit excited 
by the celebration of the new Sorbonne in 1889, contributed greatly 
to the brilliancy of the Lyons festivities. 
At the universities of Lille, Nancy, and Poitiers the ceremonies were 
marked by equal enthusiasm. The rector of the University of Lille 
expressed the utmost confidence in the continued liberality of the 
city, which has already by its efforts advanced its university to the 
first rank. The faculty of medicine announced the gift of $20,000 
from a private source. The name of Pasteur was recalled with pride 
as the first dean of the faculty of sciences of this university.
-P-A-G-E-117
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 37 
  The University of Aix-Marseille has great possibilities, which are 
somewhat clouded for the time by the jealousy of the two rival cen- 
ters, Aix being the seat of the faculties of law and of letters and 
Marseille that of the faculties of sciences and of medicine and phar- 
macy. The endeavor to allay local jealousies by conferring the double 
name upon the university has been only partially successful. While 
the universities which have their seats in the great centers of com- 
merce and industry enter upon the new order with great confidence, 
a different spirit is evinced in the smaller universities. The burden 
imposed upon the latter was freely admitted at Caen, which sees its 
ablest students irresistibly attracted to Paris to finish their studies, 
and which can not hope for municipal subsidies comparable with those 
of Bordeaux, of Lyons, of Lille, and Marseille. There remains simply 
the hope that in such cases the university may draw support from the 
entire academic region. Thus Caen would become the “‘ University 
of Normandie,” adapting itself to the special interests of the region— 
agricultural, commercial, or industrial—giving large place to the study 
of local history, the old Norman tongue, Norman laws and monu- 
ments, and drawing thereby the sympathies of those who are descended. 
from Norman ancestry and identified with the region and the history 
of which the university will become the exponent. | 
The opinion seems to be general that France will not be able to 
maintain fifteen universities of first rank, and that several of those 
now constituted will eventually be eliminated, or possibly transformed 
into special schools. 
A new university doctorate open to foreigners.—The superior coun- 
cil of public instruction has decided that French universities may 
create a doctorate which will be purely scientific, and for which the 
French diplomas of. ‘‘bachelier” and ‘‘licencié” are not necessarily 
required. The degree is open alike to natives and foreigners, and it 
is not required that candidates should have effected the whole of 
their studies in France. 
The following is the text of the decree to this effect, passed July 9 
of the present year: 
Besides the degrees established by the State the universities are empowered to 
institute titles of a nature purely scientific. These titles shall confer none of the 
rights and privileges attached by law and regulation to the degrees, and shall in 
no case be declared a substitute. 
The studies and examinations which shall attend their distribution shall be sup- 
ject to regulations deliberated by the council of the university and approved by 
the standing committee of the superior council of public instruction. The diplo- 
mas shall be delivered in the name of the university, by the president of the 
council, in forms different from the forms of those delivered by the Government. 
Up to the present time all diplomas in France have been granted 
by the State, not by the universities. These diplomas carried pro- 
fessional priviliges and other rights of importance chiefly to French

citizens, and were guarded by necessary formalities with which 
foreigners, and Americans in particular, found it almost impossible 
to comply. 
DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
Scope of secondary schools.—Secondary instruction is a term of 
somewhat different application in France from that which it has in 
the United States. The typical secondary schools are the lycées or 
State classical colleges, long the central feature of the university sys- 
tem, and the church schools (6tablissements congréganistes) of similar 
grade. Pupils enter these institutions (either as boarders or day 
pupils) at about 8 years of age, having already mastered the elements 
of reading and writing, and remain until their general education is 
complete. The great end in view is the bachelor’s degree, which is the 
prerequisite to official and professional careers and to social recogni- 
tion. Ifa student is able to maintain the maximum of effort, the final 
examination may be passed and the coveted prize secured at 18 years 
of age. As a rule, however, pupils do not complete the ten years’ 
course without duplicating one or two years’ study. It will be under- 
stood from the statement that the secondary school of France is nota 
grade between elementary and superior institutions, as in this coun- 
try, but is a school for the complete education of the higher social 
classes. 
Altogether there are for boys five classes of secondary establish- 
ments, between which in 1895 the entire enrollment of secondary 
pupils, 180,791, was distributed as follows:

dents.

Public lyeées and communal colleges - 47.3   
   Church schools .-.-.--.--- 32.10 
Small seminaries (clerical) - 13.92 
Private institutions 6.61 
  
As all degrees are conferred by the State, the examinations being 
conducted by professors specially detailed for that service, it follows 
that the course of study prescribed for the lyeées (State classical col- 
leges) determines that of all the other secondary schools. The lycée 
has both a classical and modern course, but since the former leads to 
the bachelor’s degree, it embodies the present ideal of secondary 
instruction. The programme now in force has been given in full in 
recent reports of this office,t but some repetition of it is desirable for 
an understanding of the present situation. To premise, the lycée is 
organized in three sections—elementary (years 8 to 11), grammar 
(years 11 to 14), superior (14 to 18). 
Promotion from one section to the other is secured by examination. 
  
1See in particular the report for 1890-91, vol. 1, pp. 120-124,
-P-A-G-E-119
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 39 
  The studies of the higher section may suffice to indicate the prepara- 
tion required for the bachelor’s degree. They comprise in the third 
or lowest class of the section, the second class, and class of rhetoric 
the following: French grammar, literature, and composition; German 
or English; history of Europe, and of France in particular; geography, 
mathematics, drawing, Latin, and Greek, and in the second class also, 
the history of literature (Greek, Latin, and French). The full pro- 
gramme in mathematics, Latin, and Greek for the class of rhetoric 
(age, 16 years) is as follows: 
Mathematies.—One and a half hours per week. Arithmetic: Review through 
square root. Algebra: Review and continuation through equations of the second 
degree. Geometry and cosmography: Solid geometry finished—through the 
sphere; the celestial sphere; earth, sun, time, moon, eclipses, planets, stars, 
universal gravitation, tides. 
Latin.—Four hours a week. Portions of Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, 
Livy, and Tacitus. 
Greek.—Four hours a week. Portions of Homer, Sophocles, Plato, and 
Demosthenes. 
After rhetoric comes the first examination for the bachelor’s diploma; 
then follows the class of philosophy, which offers a choice between 
letters and science; from this class the student passes to the final 
examination. It will be seen that this programme is comparable to 
that of an American preparatory school, with two years of college 
added. 
The communal colleges, which are established by local authorities 
with the aid of the State, offer, so far as practicable, the same course 
as the lyeées. Few of them, however, are able to cover the complete 
programme. 
Rivalry between State and church secondary schools.—Since the 
secondary establishments are in reality the colleges or schools of lib- 
eral culture, exercising through their graduates an immense influence 
upon society, the State has every motive for seeking to draw students 
to its own secondary schools; hence it views with alarm the growing 
ascendency of the clerical establishments. By reference to the table 
given below it will be seen that while the number of pupils in the 
public secondary schools has remained nearly stationary for the four 
years compared, the-attendance in the two classes of church schools 
has greatly increased, rising from 75,035 in 1892 to 82,657.

AO EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  The causes of the movement indicated by the above statistics have 
been set forth in an official statement, which does not, however, pre- 
tend to be exhaustive. They are, as enumerated, increase in tuition 
fees and living expenses; the cost of books and apparatus; too fre- 
quent changes in the courses of study; uncertainties respecting the 
position of the répétiteurs or tutors, who sustain close relations to 
the pupils; the want of united interest and sympathies on the part of 
the officers and professors; the excessive officialism and consequent 
diminution of the personal influence of professors, and the want of 
relations between the State secondary and primary schools. It is also 
recognized that the development of the superior primary schools 
(public high schools) has had some effect in reducing the attendance 
upon public secondary schools. From details furnished in the report 
it appears that the day pupils (externes) are at a peculiar disadvan- 
tage, as they must buy the text-books, at a cost of about $10 a year, 
or $100 for the complete course, whereas these are furnished gratui- 
tously to boarders (internes), save that the parents must pay a small 
charge (about $2.40 a year) for the wear of the books. This is 
regarded as an unjustifiable discrimination that should be corrected. 
Already a revision of the fees for tuition is in progress, with a view 
to reduction, but this can not be accomplished at once, as it necessi- 
tates changes in the appropriation. The other causes that are 
believed to prevent the growth of the State schools are inherent in 
the system and can be reached only through a transformation, which 
seems to be gradually taking place. 
While the status of the State schools with respect to attendance is 
not wholly satisfactory, it is noted in the official report that they con- 
tribute a much larger proportion of students to the special schools of 
the highest order, than the rival institutions. This is an important 
matter, as these graduates enter eventually into the most influential 
public services. The following table is presented to show the com- 
parative standing of the several classes of schools in this particular:

It is an interesting fact that while clerical influence seems just now 
to threaten the ascendency of the lycées, the State secondary schools 
and classes for girls established’ under the law of 1880 appear to be

overcoming the prejudices which they at first encountered. At least 
such is the inference from the growth in enrollment shown in the 
following statistics: 
Public lycées, colleges, and secondary courses for girls.

The administration and studies of these institutions are managed 
with special reference to the aptitudes, needs, and probable careers 
of young women. Pupils enter at 12 years of age. The course is 
divided into two periods of three and of two years, respectively, thus 
allowing five years for the full period. A sixth year may be added 
for students who desire to prepare for admission to superior institu- 
tions or for special vocations. 
State appropriations.—For buildings and equipments alone the 
State has contributed to secondary institutions since 1878 the sum of 
$22,173,333, of which a little above $2,000,000 went to the secondary 
schools for girls. The annual appropriations for the current expenses 
of the lyeées and communal colleges (for boys) and the public sec- 
ondary schools for girls have been as follows for the years named: 
1894, $4,038,248; 1895, $4,073,165; 1896, $4,096,447.20. 
The distribution of the appropriation for 1896 was as follows:

  The receipts from the lycées are turned into the State treasury. 
About one-third of the lycées contribute to the treasury more than 
they receive from it. The remainder do not cover their own expenses. 
However, the totalannual receipts are in general in excess of the cur- 
rent expenditures, the balance accruing to the State being $18,633 in 
1896. 
The number of State scholarships accorded in 1896 was 3,315 in the 
lycées and 1,636 in the communal colleges. These are secured by 
competitive examination. Remission of fees is made in favor of the 
sons and grandsons of teachers and professors in public schools—that 
is, in the university service. Complaint is made that the number of 
scholarships and gratuities has become excessive. It is urged, on the 
other hand, that the church makes liberal provision, the exact extent 
of which is unknown, for poor but promising youths and that the 
State can not at this time afford to diminish the inducements it holds 
out to students entering upon secondary instruction. 
Proposed changes.—The difficulties in the way of desirable changes 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  in the system of State secondary education are very great, as shown 
by the efforts of half a century. The most important measure now 
under consideration relates to the baccalaureate. This diploma has 
been the subject of proposed reforms for the last decade. Successive 
ministers of public instruction have embodied their ideas in projects 
of law, which have been submitted, provoked discussion, and then 
abandoned. The latest project emanates from the present minister, 
M. Rambaud, who, without attempting radical changes, would greatly 
reduce the element of chance in the conditions upon which the diploma 
is secured. To this end he proposes to give greater weight to the 
student’s record, as shown in his report book (livret scolaire), and to 
reconstitute the examining bodies so as to include therein “‘agrégés” 
or assistant professors who actually teach in the secondary schools. 
As the project will probably suffer the fate of its predecessors, its 
details need not be rehearsed. American readers will be more inter- 
ested in the discussion of the scholastic and social bearings of the 
diploma called forth by these projects. These are graphically pre- 
sented in recent articles by M. E. Boutmy, the distiguished writer on 
moral and political sciences and director of the Paris School of 
Political Science. 
The immediate occasion of M. Boutmy’s articles was a project of 
law offered by the minister preceding M. Rambaud and differing sub- 
stantially from his own. As this project failed, it will suffice to say 
here that it proposed to reduce the obligatory part of the baccalau- 
reate examination and to increase the electives, and, further, that the 
diploma should indicate precisely the subjects in which the candidate 
had achieved success. The project was favored by M. Boutmy as a 
means of eliminating the caste tendencies of the diploma and also 
of freeing the courses of secondary instruction from a paralyzing 
dependence upon the State examinations. 
Extended citations from these articles are presented in an appendix 
to this chapter. | 
As regards the programme of studies for the lycées, these have 
remained unchangéd since 1890. Slight modifications have been 
attempted, one, the introduction of Latin a year earlier than that 
assigned in the programme, namely, in the seventh or highest class of 
the preparatory section. 
The experiment has, however, been abandoned, as has also that of 
using the modern pronunciation in Greek classes, which was given 
up after four months’ trial. 
The remoyal of Greek from the class of obligatory subjects has 
been seriously urged from time to time, but the proposition serves 
only as an occasion for arguments pro and con. The prevalence of 
the same discussion in our own country gives interest to a recent 
address of M. Michel Bréal on the importance of Greek, which is 
included among the appended papers.

DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
The latest official report of the department of primary instruction 
is for the year 1894-95, a résumé of which was presented in the Com- 
missioner’s last report (1895-96). The principal statistics are also 
repeated in this report (tables, p. 32). 
New law respecting teachers’ salaries.—The law with respect to the 
classification and salaries of teachers passed July, 1893, goes into 
effect the present year. The chief modification which it introduces 
is in the classification of teachers of the elementary primary schools. 
The teaching force consists of probationers (stagiaires) and full 
teachers (titulaires). The former, under the new law, comprise 15 
per cent of the total number in place of 20 per cent, as under the pre- 
vious law, and the annual salary is raised from $160 to $180. 
The ‘‘titulaires” are divided into five classes. The proportion that 
each class bears to the total force under the two laws, and the sala- 
ries which remain unchanged under the new law, are as follows:

total number in each class. Annual salaries.

Observation.—An additional sum of $40 is allowed principals in charge of a 
school of three or four classes, and of $80 for a school of more than four classes. 
Communes may and often do supplement these salaries. Moreover, every com- 
mune must provide its teachers with free residence or with a money indemnity 
for the same at fixed rates. 
It will be seen that the increase of the proportion of teachers in the 
third, second, and first classes increases the advantages that the sery- 
ice offers, and at the same time ealls for larger appropriations from 
the State, which pays the salaries. 
The principle of a fixed proportion of teachers in each class met 
with decided opposition in the Chamber of Deputies, and the abolition 
of these “‘percentages” in the classification of the teachers of the 
superior primary (high) schools and in the primary normal schools is 
regarded as an important triumph. :

a Increase of $20 over the former salaries, 
  The State is responsible only for the legal salary of the primary 
teachers (elementary and superior), and as a rule these are increased 
by the communes. Thus in Paris the directors of the higher pri- 
maries receive as a minimum salary $1,400; maximum, $1,800; full 
professors from $760 to $1,000. 
Scope and progress of superior primary schools.—Superior primary 
(high) schools are nonclassical high schools which carry the instruc- 
tion of pupils for two, three, or four years beyond the elementary 
primaries. They were authorized by Guizot’s law of 1833, which also 
prescribed a programme comprising an extension of the subjects of 
the lower primaries, with the addition of linear geometry with its use- 
ful applications, surveying, elements of the physical sciences, and 
natural history, with their practical applications. It was further pro- 
vided that the courses should be specially developed in subjects 
required by local conditions. The establishment of schools of this 
grade was made obligatory for communes of more than 6,000 inhab- 
itants. The execution of the law was long delayed by political vicis- 
situdes, and, outside of a few cities which established high schools of 
the general character indicated without aid from the State, they had 
no existence until a comparatively recent date. The municipal high 
schools soon became noted for the excellence of their scientific courses 
and the artistic and technical skill manifested by their graduates.

  In 1878 the General Government indicated its purpose of fostering 
, higher primary schools by a credit of $22,000 to aid communes in their 
establishment. This appropriation has been augmented year by year, 
and has proved a great stimulus to local effort. 
Peculiar complications arose from the endeavor to class in the same 
category schools for general instruction and a class of schools indus- 
trial or commercial in their character (écoles professionelles) that had 
been established in a few cities. The development of both classes of 
schools was retarded until the school law of 1886 prescribed explicitly 
the scope, studies, and general management of all schools classed as 
primary. 
It soon became evident that high schools with a purely literary 
curriculum were likely to crowd out those having a technical charac- 
ter, and as this was regarded as a national misfortune measures were 
taken to increase the provision of the latter class. Accordingly, in. 
1892 a department of technical instruction was created in the minis- 
try of commerce and industry, and appropriations covering salaries 
and many other expenses were offered through this ministry for 
schools giving instruction in commerce and industry to pupils from 
the elementary schools. Such schools were also transferred to the 
jurisdiction of the ministry of commerce and industry, and are known 
as practical schools of commerce and industry. By this arrangement 
the minister of education was left free to develop higher primary 
schools of a more educative character. 
The purpose, however, was not to increase the literary influence of 
higher primaries, and the regulations issued since 1892, especially 
the official programmes of 1893 and also the actual course which these 
schools have taken, show a strict adherence to the purpose of making 
them schools for practical training. 
Under the regulations of 1893 every higher primary school may 
have, in addition to its general course, special sections—industrial, 
commercial, or agriculturai. Schools in which these technical depart- 
ments are distinctly developed come under the direction of the min- 
ister of commerce and industry with respect to the same, but as 
regards teachers and general programmes remain under the minister 
of public instruction. The various measures indicate the double 
purpose of fostering manual skill and technical knowledge among 
the more promising youth of the laboring classes and at the same 
time extending the scope of their general education. 
The initial stage of the higher primary school is often an advanced 
course (cours complémentaire) annexed to the lower primary and 
under the same director. These higher primary schools are supported 
by the combined efforts of the State and the communes. The State 
assumes the legal salaries of the regular staff, which amounts to 
about five-sevenths of the total salaries required to maintain the full 
complement of teachers. The municipality (commune) must pay the
-P-A-G-E-126
46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-97. 
salaries of teachers in charge of the workshop and also of the per- 
sons employed as technical and industrial teachers. 
The expense for buildings, furniture, apparatus, etc., must also be 
met by the commune. 
The State assists in bringing the provision within the reach of poor 
but promising youth by a system of scholarships. These are of three 
classes: 
(a) ‘‘D’internat,” to cover or partially cover the expenses of pupils 
in boarding schools, not to exceed $100 per annum. 
(b) ‘‘Familiales,” to pay for boarding out the scholar in a private 
family when his home is at a long distance from the school and the 
latter has no boarding house; value, $100. 
(c) “‘D’entretien,” to pay the parents for the scholar’s food, clothes, 
traveling expenses, etc., and to help toward making good the sacrifice 
_of his wages while he is kept at school (varying from $20 to $80). 
Candidates must not be less than 12 or more than 15 years of age. 
The scholarships are tenable for three years, with possible extension 
to a fourth year. 
These scholarships are secured by strict competitive examination 
and only by successful candidates who can prove that they would be 
unable without the assistance to continue their studies. The num- 
ber of State scholarships awarded in 1892 was: To boys, 674; to girls, 
436, or atotal of 1,110. The departments and communes also provide 
scholarships. 
Under the admission requirements prescribed by the minister for all 
pupils, no child can enter the higher primaries unless he has obtained 
the ‘‘ certificate of primary instruction” and has passed a year in the 
highest standards of the elementary schools, or if educated privately 
can prove equivalent attainments. 
The recent increase in the number of these establishments is indi- 
cated by the following statistics: 
In 1878 they numbered only 40. In 1887 there were 255, besides 
431 complementary courses. At this date 47 private schools of the 
same grade were reported. The total enrollment, public and private 
schools, was 38,441. In 1892 the situation was as follows:

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. AT 
The increase in enrollment in five years, it will be seen, was 7,158 
pupils. 
Among the public schools are included 47 which are essentially 
technical, and as such under the joint control of the two ministers, as 
already specified. 
The following additional particulars with respect to this feature of 
the primary-school system of France are from a very exhaustive report 
on the subject by Mr. R. L. Morant, assistant director of the recently 
ereated department of special inquiries and reports in the English 
department.! 
Organization.—One very important point should here be noted; 
both the ‘‘cours complémentaires” and the higher primary schools 
are, in intention, ‘‘écoles régionales;” that is to say, though their 
creation and maintenance is decided upon and paid for by one com- 
mune or town, most of them serve the needs, not only of the town 
itself, but of all the surrounding districts. Many of them draw pupils 
from aradius of several leagues, and, though the town itself has borne all 
the expense of establishing and maintaing the schools, no restrictions 
are as arule placed upon the district from which scholars are admitted. 
As a result of being “‘écoles régionales,” a large number both of the 
higher primary schools and of the “‘cours complémentaires” have 
boarding houses. These are built by the town at the same time as 
the rest of the school.” 
Sometimes they are managed by the town under asalaried ‘‘économe” 
or burser and bring in actual profits to the town budget; but in the 
vast majority of cases, in the provinces at least, they are left to the 
charge (and profit) of the director of the school. Half the boys’ 
higher primary schools and two-thirds of those for girls have ‘‘inter- 
nats,” i. e., are at least partly boarding schools. This is the case also 
with half the boys’ ‘“‘cours complémentaires” and nearly one-third of 
those for girls. There is thus in France practically a widespread 
system of municipal boarding schools, with the staff supplied at the 
expense of the State. 
The fees for the boarding houses vary from $80 to $150 per annum, the greater 
number ranging about $125. For the externes or day boys there is also in most 
schools a system of “études surveillées ;” that is to say, pupils may stay at the school 
beyond the fixed school hours (usually 8 a. m. to 11a, m., and1p. m. to4p. m.), 
under the supervision of the school staff, from 5 to 7 p.m. A charge is made for 
this in most schools, but not in all, amounting to $10 or $15 a year. In Paris great 
discussion has arisen upon this point, the progressive members on the council 
insisting that these charges are contrary to the spirit of the free-education act, 
and tend to place hindrances in the way of the spread of higher primary instruc-

290-336.

taken over ata valuation by the municipality, the original director and staff being 
often retained.

  tion among the working classes. The outlay for books and other requirements 
varies considerably. In the larger towns this is generally provided by the munic- 
ipal funds free. No fees may be charged for ‘‘instruction,” for the higher pri- 
mary schools and the ‘‘cours complémentaires” are held to be included under the 
term ‘‘public establishments for primary instruction,” in which ‘gratuité” was 
enforced by the free-education act of 1881. 
The higher primary school is open to all comers without distinction who come 
up to the prescribed standard of knowledge. Children who, having been educated 
privately, do not possess the elementary certificate are submitted to an examina- 
tion equivalent to it in the subjects of the upper standards of the elementary school. 
But, as a matter of fact, about 90 per cent of these schools are recruited entirely 
from the public elementary schools, and it is only in those country districts where 
no means of obtaining any form of secondary education exist -vithin any reasonable 
distance that the contrary is the case. 
As regards the standard of admission to the school, the central authority has 
attempted to raise the general level by various means, and to confine the admission 
more strictly to the élite of the elementary schools, by requiring that no pupil be 
admitted unless, besides holding the elementary certificate, he has passed a year 
in the highest standard of the elementary school. In many places thereis also an 
entrance examination, the standard of which is practically decided upon by the 
local authority, and sometimes considerably raises the standard of the school. 
And in a few of the largest towns, where the number of candidates is greater than 
the number of vacancies, this examination comes to bea competitive examination. 
In Paris there is one simultaneous public examination for all the higher primary 
schools. Thesuccessful candidates, i.e., those who passacertain standard of marks, 
are ranged in order of merit, and are then called upon (in this order) to choose the 
school to which they prefer to go, according to the number of vacancies that are 
available in each. There is also an examination at the end of each quarter, of 
which the results are sent to the parents. These examinations area great stimulus 
to hard work, and assist also in pointing out the pupils who would be unable to 
profit by a continued stay at the school. These are invariably ‘‘advised” to leave. 
It is very generally understood, and is carried into practice, that one of the most 
important duties of the director is to advise parents for and against the continu- 
ance of the children’s attendance at the school, as also in the matter of choosing the 
particular section (commercial, industrial, etc.) which he shall enter. The 
director’s opinion is invariably (and, indeed, statutorily) decisive on the former 
point, besides being very generally paramount as to the latter. 
The school is divided into ‘‘ years” of study, and promotions into each division 
or ‘“‘year’’ take place only once in twelve months. For this purpose there is an 
annual examination of a very searching nature, called ‘‘examen du passage;” and 
it is only upon passing this examination that a pupil is moved into the next “‘ year.” 
Anyone failing to pass has either to leave or to “redoubler,” i. e., to stay another 
year in the division in which he has already been working. This occurs in a 
great number of cases, especially at the end of the first ‘‘ year.” 
This annual examination and its consequences is one of the most striking fea- 
tures of the system, and admirably prevents any waste of public funds and of 
teacher's energy in vain attempts to educate children who are not capable enough 
to profit by their opportunities. 
Mention must also be made of the important part played in the actual manage- 
ment of each school by its ‘‘comité de patronage.” The composition of each com- 
mittee of managers is fixed by the education department on the nomination of its 
localrepresentative. The director or directress of the school is an ex officio mem- 
ber, as also is the primary inspector of the district and the chief inspector of the 
province. In the case of girls’ schools there must be a certain number of ladies 
on the committee. The committee nominates its own president and secretary. It
-P-A-G-E-129
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 49 
  meets at least twice in each year, at the summons of the president, and in spe- 
cial cases when convened by the president or by the provincial inspector. At its 
ordinary meetings it nominates a subcommittee to visit the school at least once 
a month and report to the committee at the next meeting. The committee is 
intrusted with the general supervision of the schools and of all that pertains to 
its efficiency and the interests of the pupils. It takes the latter under its patronage 
and endeavors to settle them in suitable occupations at the end of their school 
course. The pupils holding State scholarships are especially under the care of the 
committee.! It further deals with all matters of school requisites and furniture 
and decides on the measures to be taken to adapt the special instruction to the 
local requirements, industries, manufactures, agricultural or other occupations, 
For this purpose all prominent business men in the locality are nominated on these 
committees. 
Curriculum.—The first year’s course is the same for all pupils who enter the 
school, no specialization being permitted till the commencement of the second 
year. It isthen that the student decides, generally under the advice of the director, 
the particular section in which he will pursue his course. The particular charac- 
teristics of each of the sections (general, commercial, industrial, and agricultural) 
appear in the number of hours allotted to the different subjects in each section 
respectively. There are six subjects, however, which do not vary at all, being 
considered to represent the basis of all instruction, and to be, therefore, necessary 
toevery section alike. Thus morals, handwriting, history, civic instruction, gym- 
nastics, and singing are taught one hour a week each, both to boys and girls, in 
all three years and in all the sections, and boys have two hours and girls one 
hour for physics and chemistry in all three years in all sections. Elementary 
notions of common law and political economy are taught one hour a week in the 
third year of each section both to boys and girls. 
The other subjects of instruction vary considerably in the different sections. 
Thus, for modern languages, the general section has three hours a week in all 
three years both for girls and boys, while in the commercial section this is raised 
to four hours for both and in the industrial section it disappears entirely for boys, 
being replaced by additional mathematics, science, and manual work. The girls’ 
industrial section, however, retains three hours a week for modern languages and 
does not increase the mathematics. 
Similarly, drawing and modeling, both for boys and girls, is given four anda 
half hours a week in the industrial section, three hours in the general section, and 
only one and a half in the commercial section. Both the commercial and indus- 
trial sections make up for thei1 increase of special subjects by reducing their French 
language and literature. 
Each section, has of course, its own specialties. The chief characteristic of the 
general section is the amount of time given to French language and literature— 
from three to five hours a week for boys and girls alike. Itis from this section 
that the normal colleges are largely recruited, and “‘ general culture” is considered 
its main purpose. 
The industrial section is naturally characterized by more mathematics and tech- 
nical drawing, and also by its manual work, “ travaux manuels,” which take six 
hours a week, as contrasted with two hours in the commercial section. 
The characteristics of the commercial section are, as would be expected, book- 
keeping and languages, the former being represented by three hours a week, as 
compared with one hour in the other sections, and the latter by four Hees a week, 
There is also an additional hour for commercial geography. 
The agricultural section, in its turn, has no modern languages, very little draw-

  ing, and is stronger in the natural sciences and in manual occupations bearing 
upon soil culture. It is of more recent foundation than the others, and is destined 
to play a great part in the technical education of the French agriculturist, espe- 
cially while true “technical” classes in agriculture are stillsorare. * * * 
For girls the programme of subjects, as regards the detailed curriculum, differs 
but little from that of the boys. They are given one hour a week in the third year 
for domestic economy, and the practical side of this subject forms an important 
part of their “travaux manuels.” In the industrial, commercial, and agricultural 
sections the curriculum for girls is purposely left to be decided according to the 
needs of each locality. Thus the departmental instructions say: “It will be very 
necessary to take local needs into consideration for the determination of this sup- 
plementary programme and for fixing the extra hours of teaching, so that the 
entry of pupils into industrial or commercial schools of the district may be made 
as easy as possible.” 
But perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the most controversial, question 
in the curriculum of the higher primary schools is that of the “‘ travaux manuels.” 
There is no doubt that in the intention of the education department the higher 
primary schools are not to teach, or even to prepare for, any one particular trade. 
Thus M. Brunel, director of primary instruction for the northern departments, 
says: “‘The general character of the teaching which obtains in higher primary 
schools applies equally in the matter of the manual work, in spite of the varied 
occupations dealt with. The object of the manual work is, first, to educate the 
eye and hand. In applying this education there is a gradual tendency toward a 
more special object. But the special sections do not prepare either artisans, or 
commercial clerks, or agriculturists, but find out and develop in each student the 
aptitude to become some one of these. They give the students an inclination, so 
tospeak. They put them at the point of entrance into the calling in which they 
will have to pass their lives, having furnished them with a better provision for 
life’s journey.” 
When the “ travaux manuels” or any other pari of the school course give instruc- 
tion in the definite practice of any particular industry, the school ought, according 
to the statutes, to be classed as an ‘“‘école pratique d’industrie” and placed under 
the minister of technical instruction, and similarly also if it teaches the practice 
of any special commercial business. 
So that it is in the programme of the ‘‘travaux manuels” that the general char- 
acter of the instruction given in higher primary schools (properly so called) is 
perhaps most apparent. In carrying out the programme considerable variety 
of application is possible, and, in fact, exists; but there are a certain number of 
recognized models, both in woodwork and ironwork, which are practically in 
universal use and serve sufficiently to demonstrate the general course of the 
study adopted. Moreover, the fact that every section alike—general, commercial, 
and industrial—is put through the same course of ‘‘travaux manuels” conclusively 
shows that no specialization or trade apprenticeship is intended or attempted; 
and though the industrial section has six hours a week for travaux manuels, and 
the commercial section only two, and the general section four, the same curricu- 
lum is required in each, the special directions for the special sections being simply 
. as follows: ‘‘For the commercial section the programme is to be confined to the 
most usual and elementary exercises. For the industrial and agricultural sections 
the programme is to be the same as in the general section, but covering rather 
more ground.” 
By article 39 of the decree of December, 1893 (the latest regulations for the 
organization of theso schools), every higher primary school and every ‘‘ cours com- 
plémentaire” must have a workshop, and every pupil is put through the wood 
course as well as the iron course; and the object always to be held in view is to 
develop skillfulness of hand and eye and general acquaintance with the use of
-P-A-G-E-131
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 51 
tools and with the properties of wood and iron in every child before leaving the 
school, whatever his vocation in life may be. There is to be no attempt to simulate 
a genuine apprenticeship. 
The drawing and modeling courses are in general the same for each section. 
The industrial section only adds working models of simple machinery made from 
sketches and scale drawings, and in the commercial and agricultural sections 
some additional scale drawing is given, so that in this subject, too, the student is 
not intended to specialize. Thus M. Le Blanc says: ‘‘ The ‘école primaire supé- 
rieure,’ and even the ‘école professionnelle,’ does not prepare draftsmen, Indus- 
try provides herself with these by other means. It educates the prospective work- 
ingman so that he shall know both how to read and how to execute drawings 
of the kind generally used in workshops, but it does not turn out skilled drafts- 
men such as are produced in architects’ studios.” 
At the same time exceptions may be made for local requirements. Thus M. 
Brunel says: ‘‘The elasticity of the organization of higher primary education 
leaves room for innovations necessitated by local needs, Thus in one of our 
‘écoles supérieures’ for girls in the north we inaugurated a course of industrial 
drawing, intended to prepare artists whose talent would enable them to find 
assured employment in the manufacture of textile fabrics.” 
It should be added that there is an important note in the official programme of 
the ‘‘travaux manuels” which requires every exercise to be done after asketchand 
scale drawing, a point which is held of great importance in fixing the educative 
value of all woodwork training as apart from mere carpenter’s dexterity. 
Mention must also be made of the excellent foreign-travel scholarships—‘‘ bourses 
de séjour 4 l’étranger.” These date from 1883, and owe their origin, like so much 
of the best parts of French primary education, to M. Buisson. The first candi- 
dates were sent to Switzerland on an allowance of $20 a month, and were chiefly 
intended to enter the teaching profession on their return to France, The results 
achieved were so satisfactory that the system was rapidly extended. Various 
changes have occurred in the arrangements from time to time, and the whole his- 
tory of the movement is well worthy of study. This memorandum will, however, 
deal only with the present arrangements as applicable to students of the higher 
primary schools. 
In these schools the traveling scholarships are given upon a public competitive 
examination. The candidates must be between 16 and 19 years of age, and must 
prove that their parents are unable to send them abroad at their own expense, 
The scholarships set apart for pupils of higher primary schools are given solely to 
those who intend to follow a commercial or industrial career, the ‘‘ general” stu- 
dents (most of whom enter the teaching profession) being sufficiently provided 
for by the traveling scholarships set apart for members of the staff of normal col- 
leges. The scholarship holders enter as students in commercial schools or general 
schools in other countries to which they are sent, and sometimes as apprentices or 
clerks, without pay,in business houses. They are obliged to write monthly theses 
in the language of the country where they are residing. These are examined by 
the ‘‘comité de patronage,” who are responsible in France for the general arrange- 
ments of the scheme and for placing the scholars.' The scholarships are usually 
tenable for a year, with possibility of extension. They vary in amount for the 
different countries where they are held, those in England being much the highest. 
There are at present three in Germany (Bremen, Hamburg, and Munich) and nine 
in England (Clifton, Manchester, Birmingham, Exeter, London, Newcastle, and 
Liverpool). The experiment has been a great success. Thus M. Armagnac says: 
“If we glance through the correspondence of the scholarship holders from the 
  
1Some of the reports written by normal-college scholarship holders have been 
very valuable, and have been published in the Revue Pédagogique. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
écoles primaires supérieures, we find a sentiment which is expressed nearly every- 
where under an almost identical form: ‘I am treated like a child of the house;’ 
‘Tam here in the position of a son;’ ‘It seems just as if I were one of the family.’ 
And everywhere the intellectual and moral effects are on a par with the material 
comforts with which the scholar is surrounded. He is encouraged, upheld, and 
counseled. While he is allowed a great deal of liberty, the company he keeps is 
watched. He is put into communication with good comrades and respectable 
families. In fact, in every respect he is treated as a good father would treat him. 
These are services which can not be forgotten, and for which their authors can 
not be sufficiently thanked. And while learning the language of the country 
which receives them the scholars learn at the same time their manners and cus- 
toms.”! ‘Iam surprised at the earnestness of your young men,” writes the head 
of an English training college to a member of the committee, and a few days later 
one of these young men wrote in his turn: ‘‘I imagined the English to be the cold- 
est natured people in the world. They seem so at first, but how pleasant they are 
when the ice is broken. I am loaded with kind attentions and surrounded with 
friends.” 
It is intended in the future to send scholars also to Spain, Italy, the Nether- 
lands, and Russia. Already the municipalities have followed the example of the 
State, and many now set apart municipal funds every year for these traveling 
scholarships. In 1889 there were as many as 67 pupils of higher primary schools 
who had been sent to England and Germany by these means. 
Social class of the students.—Perhaps the next point of importance in gauging 
the work of the higher primary school system in France is to discover how far 
the schools are frequented by the class of children for whom they were intended. 
The answer to this question must vary toa certain extent with the locality. There 
are instances where the ‘‘ well-to-do” classes have made considerable use of the 
admirable instruction provided in the higher primary schools, but it seldom 
happens that they are numerous enough to keep out the most intelligent of those 
who in a pecuniary sense need it more; for wherever there is an insufficiency of 
places it is open competition that decides admission, so that the cleverer pupils 
always get in first; and the cleverer pupils of the elementary school have every 
chance of success, since the subjects and methods of the examination are strictly 
on the lines of the elementary school upper standard and certificate work. 
Moreover, the fact of ‘‘gratuité” has an immensely potent social influence in 
France. By the act of 1881 all “primary instruction” was made free, and by 
the act of 1886 higher primary schools and apprenticeship schools were specially 
pamed as being parts of primary instruction; hence fees may not be charged for 
the instruction given in them. And in France there is still sufficient ‘‘amour 
propre” of a peculiar kind to prevent any large use of free schools by any social 
class higher than the ‘petit bourgeois”—firstly, from a dread of ‘‘promiscuité” 
(i. e., the mixed character of the children who will be found there), and, secondly, 
from a feeling of social pride, which hesitates to make use of free schools provided 
out of public funds. 
Asa general rule, it may be safely said that in the larger towns the higher 
primary schools are frequented solely by children who enter them direct from the 
elementary schools, for there is sufficient provision both for preparatory and for 
higher education in the lycées and in private schools for those who dislike the ‘‘ pro- 
miscuité” of the free higher primary school. But in the provincial districts, where 
the higher primary school is sometimes the only available means that exists for 
any efficient higher education for many miles around, and especially where a well- 
managed “internat” removes the difficulty of distance, a higher social class have

France.”
-P-A-G-E-133
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 53 
  learned to avail themselves of the excellent instruction which is there provided 
without cost, so far as the actual teaching is Goncerned. 
Movement for adult education.—The higher primary schools do not 
reach the great mass of children whose education terminates as soon 
as the obligatory course of elementary instruction is completed. The 
movement for adult education, by means of Sunday and evening 
classes, lectures, ete., is intended to save such from moral and intel- 
lectural degeneracy. 
Sinee the publication of the Commissioner’s report for 1894—95,! 
which contained the synopsis of a special report on this movement, a 
second report has appeared. This shows a continuance of the enthu- 
siasm and of the efforts, public and private, by which the movement 
is supported. 
The creation of adult classes at local expense had been authorized 
as early as 1850, and State appropriations allowed for them from 1867. 
Owing to various causes, chiefly the complete provision of elementary 
schools, these classes had declined, but resting as they did upon a legal 
basis, their revival seemed to offer the best means of carrying on the 
work of adult instruction. This provision of systematic instruction is 
supplemented in the present movement by populuar lectures, pro- 
fusely illustrated by magic-lantern views, by public readings from 
standard works, and by the use of public libraries. In his second 
special report on the movement M. Petit sums up the results achieved 
in 1896-97 as follows: 24,578 courses of instruction for adults and 
adolescents in public evening and Sunday classes, 5,000 courses offered 
by societies, boards of trade, etc., 97,313 lectures, 110 school societies 
of mutual aid formed, 1,575 associations of former pupils constituted, 
648 school ‘“‘ patronages” (societies for the moral and industrial care 
of youth) formed, 1,200 societies of popular instruction in full opera- * 
tion, 33,000 teachers engaged in the work, and 417,421 youths in regular 
attendance upon the instruction. Many and ingenious efforts are used ° 
to attract the pupils in the first instance. Handbills are displayed; 
letters sent; visits are made by the teachers; in fact, a regular crusade 
is conducted. The young people are brought together in a prelimi- 
nary session. Eloquence and arguments are employed to excite their 
interest. Once secured, however, the pupils are retained by the impor- 
tance of the work and the attractive manner in which it is carried on. 
It is of interest to note the character of the instruction thus imparted. 
Here the experience of the older societies is suggestive. The constant 
increase in the number of their pupils shows the wisdom of combining 
general culture with industrial or technical training. These societies 
even go so far as to teach special industries. 
The same course is pursued in the classes maintained by chambers 
of commerce and boards of trade, even in the smaller municipalities. 
Following these precedents, the endeavor is made to give the public

  54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
classes for adults something of the same practical character, and thus 
they are rooted, as it were, in the life of the community. 
The contrast between the present programmes and those formerly 
offered in the adult classes is indeed striking. They are no longer 
limited to the three R’s or to a mechanical drill in the subjects of the 
elementary school. Dictation is employed as a spelling exercise, but 
the matter is selected for its educational value. Short compositions 
are required, but upon subjects drawn from the daily life. Short 
lessons are given in a conversational manner on temperance, thrift, 
civil obligations, business correspondence, ete. Arithmetical prob- 
lems are related to the local industries. Tor exercises of this kind no 
text-books are at hand. They are a perpetual drain upon the inge- 
nuity and intelligence of the teacher. Often the pupils are consulted 
as to the subjects in which they desire instruction, and their sugges- 
tions prove of the greatest interest. 
It is generally the case in cities that there is a section for illiterates. 
Thus M. Petit reports that at Bordeaux he saw masons, their fingers 
stiffened by the handling of the mattock, making strenuous efforts to 
manage the pen. Elsewhere he found soldiers who could neither 
read nor write, and who had been sent to the classes by their com- 
manding officers. “e 
The tendency to give a practical character to the instruction can 
be best shown by extracts from answers given to the question, What 
programme has been generally followed ? 
“Notions of surveying and study of the general plan of land regis- 
try (plan cadastral); practical notions of agriculture and of horti- 
culture” (department of Allier). ‘‘In the majority of the schools the 
effort is made to give a very practical character to the courses. 
* Boys are taught surveying and the general plan of land registration” 
(Basses-Alpes). ‘‘Land registry, agriculture, and common law in the 
ruralcommunes; drawing and the elements of the sciences applicable 
to industry in industrial centers” (Ardennes). ‘‘ Contracts, leases, 
conduct of sales, common law” (Aube). ‘‘(1) Notions of rural law, 
leases, registries, rentals; (2) business letters, claims; (3) surveying, 
accounts, bills of exchange; (4) fertilization and improvement of 
land and of stock; analysis of soils” (Indre et Loire). ‘‘To fix and 
extend the knowledge already acquired and to meet the individual 
needs of students, as specified in the class register” (Nord). Simi- 
lar citations could be indefinitely multiplied. There are also many 
examples of special courses, as at St. Nazaire, in the department of 
Loire-Inférieure, mechanical courses in naval construction, carpentry; 
at Brest, in Finistére, courses preparatory for the workshops of a mili- 
tary post, ete. 
M. Petit advises that, as additional inducements to attend the 
classes, prizes should be offered, such as medals, books, even agricul- 
tural implements, tools, drawing implements, and in the richer com-

munes savings banks certificates and certificates on the pension 
fund for the aged. Such awards have already been made in several 
places, notably at Reims and at Havre, the cost being borne by the 
municipalities or by private benefactors. The moral effect has 
proved excellent, and the experience of private societies confirms the 
value of these expedients. 
M. Petit favors also some form of certificate for those who complete 
regular courses, and believes that in time these would be of great use 
to their possessors in securing employment, and even special favors, 
with respect to the obligatory military service. The report states that, 
although the classes for young women have been less successful than 
those for young men, they also show increase, rising from 966 in 1894-95 
to 1,808 in 1895-96, and to 4,429 in 1896-97. Some departments have 
formed no classes for women; others very few. The departments 
which stand highest in this respect are Aisne, with 253 classes, and 
Seine-et-Oise, 153, in the northeast; Haute-Garonne, 191, in the south; 
and Vosges, 128,in the east. These seem to have nothing in common 
but a determined spirit for the initiative. On the contrary, the eon- 
ditions that interfere with classes for women, which, like those for 
men, must generally be held in the evening, are the same everyhere— 
household cares, reluctance to go out in the evening without protec- 
tion, and weariness after the toil of the day. Mixed classes, it should 
be said, are little in favor outside of Paris. As to the programmes in 
the classes for women: In addition to general instruction, which, by 
universal testimony, makes a deeper impression upon young women 
than upon young men, large space is given to subjeets of special value 
for women. These include domestic economy and hygiene, sewing, 
cutting and fitting, and housework. It is urged that instruction in 
cookery, in nursing, and in the legal status of married women would 
be of great value, but these subjects can be treated more success- 
fully in weekly reunions on Thursday and Saturday than in evening 
classes. 
The funds for maintaining this work in its various departments are 
derived from private donations, from fees, municipal appropriations, 
departmental subventions, and from the State. The private dona- 
tions do not go to the teachers, but are used in the purchase of mate- 
rial. From this source were derived $11,250 in 1895-96 and $38,000 
in 1896-97. Fees contributed in the pay courses were reported from 
73 departments in 1895-96 to the amount of $11,250; from 81 depart- 
ments in 1896-97 to the amount of $12,500. 
Although there is a gradual increase in pay courses, there is no 
prospect that they will supplant the free courses. The classes of the 
population most in need of moral and industrial guidance are those 
which can not possibly be reached in this way; hence M. Petit con- 
cludes that tuition fees do not promise the solution of the financial 
problem of adult instruction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The third and most important source of income for the work under 
consideration is municipal appropriation. From this source in 
1895-96 were derived $230,000; in the following year $264,450. In 
many departments—those, for example, which include no large cities 
and in which, as is frequently the case, the communes are burdened 
with debt—very little is realized from local appropriations. The 
department of the Seine inscribed in its budget for 1896-97 a total of 
$94,248, of which $50,248 went directly to the teaching force and 
$44,000 as subventions to societies engaged in the work. In con- 
trast with this liberality the Basses-Alpes allowed only $62; the 
Hautes-Alpes, $101; Lozere, $40. In addition to the municipal or 
communal appropriations the departmental councils (conseils géné- 
reux) also make grants for the work, which tend somewhat to equalize 
the resources of the different communes within their respective limits. 
The amount from this source in 1896-97 was $8,800. 
The contributions of the State for the work of adult instruction are 
made directly to the teachers, who devote themselves to it, and consist 
of payment in time, decorations, and prizes. The payment in time is 
made either by prolonging the vacation or reducing the number of 
hours per day. The latter course is taken only in exceptional cases. 
The honors most coveted are the academic palms and ribbons, 
‘“‘palmes d’officier Vacadémie”, of which 60 are offered each year; 
*palmes d’officier de instruction publique,” 20 each year. M. Petit 
urges that these numbers be increased. 
THE REFORM OF THE BACCALAUREATE, 
[Citations from articles by M. Boutmy; Revue Bleue, April 18 and 25, 1896.] 
The baccalaureate, a social institution; sources of its strength and 
tenacity.—The baccalaureate is violently attacked just now by an 
élite of bold spirits. It has pronounced enemies outside of the uni- 
versity. It has them also—and they are not less ardent—in the 
universities themselves. Whatever be the number and the authority 
of those who lead the assault, Ido not believe that the moment of 
capitulation is near. The baccalaureate has on its side the strongest 
claim and the greatest force in the world—possession and custom. 
It has become a veritable social institution. It is incorporated in our 
legislation. Innumerable regulations make mention of it, and to it 
are attributed rights and privileges. The imagination of the reformer 
is troubled, and his arms fall in view of the enormous work of tearing 
down and rebuilding the public acts of which the baccalaureate is an 
integral part. Our bourgeoisie would be struck with a sort of stupor 
if suddenly they no longer saw the beacon that guides them and by 
which they direct their sons. They would groan like animals after a 
sudden darkening of the heavens; they would complain bitterly from 
knowing no longer which way to go. 
Moreover, either from instinctive feeling or from reason, two classes
-P-A-G-E-137
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 57 
of persons usually arrayed against each other are united in support 
of the baccalaureate—representatives of free education and, at least 
in part, the theorists, desirous of ever-increasing interference and 
control on the part of the State. These, after all, are in possession. 
They do not care to dispossess themselves; there is too much of the 
unknown in the substitutes which are offered them; they fear to lose 
by change and think it safer to maintain existing conditions. 
Representatives of free education are attached to the baccalaureate 
for other reasons that may be summed up in one sentence. The sup- 
pression of that examination would restore the complete monopoly of 
the university (i. e., the monopoly of education by the State). 
The faculties of medicine and law, the public service, are the goal 
of bachelors. They absorb almost the total number produced. The 
baccalaureate suppressed, nothing will prevent these faculties from 
deciding voluntarily or upon compulsion that they will admit to their 
examinations, degrees, or employment only the young men furnished 
with diplomas from a State lycée. Deprived of their principal outlet, 
free establishments will be deserted and have nothing to do but shut 
their doors. The baccalaureate is their protector against such acts of 
intolerance. It procures for them two considerable advantages: first, 
a dignified jury whose impartiality is above all suspicion; second, a 
uniform title that serves as a shield between them and authorities 
whose enmity they might dread. The diploma of a bachelor, granted 
by the State on the proposal of‘a jury of the State, is sufficient and 
answers for all. There is no occasion to go beyond that and ask about 
anterior preparations. Thus the baccalaureate, an official test, has 
become the best safeguard of the liberty of secondary education, and 
for this reason the representatives of free secondary instruction are 
its most faithful and earnest defenders. If the monopoly of the uni- 
versity had continued, it is nearly certain that the baccalaureate 
would have disappeared long ago. The establishment of the princi- 
ple of common right is what has done most to conserve it; the impos- 
sibility of renouncing that régime is the best guaranty of the main- 
tenance and perpetuation of an institution decried or discredited 
among many good people. The baccalaureate is efficiently protected 
also by the complexity and the divergence of those interests and rights 
which must be conciliated by any system that should be substituted 
for it. It is as difficult to dispense with it as to supply its place. 
Thus projects of reform have remained for many years in the state of 
aspiration anddreams. Untila very recent date no competent author- 
ity has consented to take the risks of adopting any one. * * * 
Class distinctions fostered by the baccalawreate.—I here mention an 
important fact too often passed over by the most determined adver- 
saries of the baccalaureate. That examination is not merely the 
sanction of secondary studies; it is an institution of much social and 
political consequence, and the effect which it produces by this relation  
-P-A-G-E-138
  58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  greatly surpasses in extent and importance its pedagogical effects. 
A century ago we made a revolution to abolish castes and their privi- 
leges; now we are indifferent to the fact that the baccalaureate is 
reestablishing what we have overthrown. It divides the nation into 
two classes; one having ‘‘ parchments,” the other not having them; 
one having sole entrance into liberal careers, the other excluded and 
confined to the old plebeian avocations—commerce and industry. 
This division takes place about the eighteenth year. The separation 
is clear and positive. One either does or does not belong to the privi- 
leged class, and it is the baccalaureate that determines. The dis- 
tinction is definite and for life. At that age one does not recommence 
his entire education. The young man who has started on another 
line, who has passed, for example, through a school of commerce or 
one of agriculture, rarely will have the heart to return to his point of 
departure and consume in elementary studies time which he could 
more usefully and manfully employ. Without such return he is 
excluded; no equivalent of merit and of title is admitted. Such an 
organization is in manifest contradiction with two principles well 
established—one economical and social; the other juridical and polit- 
ical. The first of these principles is that talents of every order 
should be left as free as possible to change their places and remove to 
those for which they believe themselves best adapted or where they 
ean render best service. Only for the most grave and peremptory 
reasons should this free circulation be hindered. The juridical and 
political principle is that of the equal admissibility of all citizens to 
positions without other distinctions than those of virtue and ability. 
No derogation that can not be fully justified should be allowed from 
that standard of right, I would go so far as to say, of publie order. 
To found in reason and in justice the privilege of some and the 
exclusion of others there would be needed nothing less than a eri- 
terion of perfect justness, having the measure of all that makes up 
the value of a man; I mean his physical and moral as well as his 
intellectual attitudes. The baccalaureate should not be accepted as 
a means of social demarcation, of qualification or disqualification for 
the high liberal careers, unless its possessors were one and all, in the 
opinion of the world, the only, or almost the only, men fit for those 
superior positions. The world holds no such opinion. 
I will show in a moment that even from the point of view of learn- 
ing and culture the baccalaureate is a very imperfect test; but were it 
perfect, it would still be an unsatisfactory principle of social demar- 
eation, because it does not reach every man, nor even the best men. 
Indeed, I know not if the fact of belonging to a certain family would 
not form a criterion less fallible or a test of classification more sure 
than the baccalaureate; hereditary transmission of quality of body and 
intellect, fireside education and examples, and noble obligation to an 
illustrious name would guarantee an average of physical, moral, and
-P-A-G-E-139
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 59 
intellectual aptitudes more surely than that average of learning and 
ability which the best judge can discover in an examination of a few 
hours. 
We have created, without doubt, a privileged class, and, what is 
more grave, we have no assurance that the privilege of the new 
‘‘noblesse” will be much better qualified than that of the old and that 
society, country, state will really be benefited by the change. 
The baccalaureate thus conceived is a veritable social evil; it largely 
increases the number of the unclassed, and it is the cause of the multi- 
plication of positions without absorbing or satisfying the ever increas- 
ing crowd of candidates. * * * 
Tas the baccalaureate in effect the virtue of diminishing the crowd, 
the prospect of which terrifies the authorities who dispose of places? 
I believe not. I even suspect the contrary. We have seen that the 
baccalaureate effects a sharp division of the nation into two classes, 
analogous to the “‘populus” and the “‘ plebs” of the Roman Republic. 
Hence its importance, worthy of the full attention of a statesman. A 
young man seeks the baccalaureate not so much that he may be pre- 
pared for a career which he has in view as that he may obtain admis- 
sion into the higher class. Once admitted, the idea never comes to 
the candidate of engaging in any profession not comprised within 
those to which his degree gives him access. He would blame himself 
for having taken so much pains to obtain a title from which he gets 
no profit; he would believe that he had failed if he made no use of 
his ‘privileges; if he were, so to speak, to retrace his steps to one of 
those courses open to nonbachelors. On the whole, the baccalaureate 
tends to obscure in the mind this verity of good common sense that 
there is no unworthy employment except that which one unworthily 
pursues, no inferior profession except that in which one fails of the 
requirements. It implies between careers a division and a hierarchy, 
in great part artificial, which in most cases would be effaced if the 
baccalaureate did not exist or were it differently organized. 
We see, then, how the baccalaureate serves to augment the mass of 
candidates for public employment. If for every employment the 
number of postulants is multiplied, it is because, first of all, that 
the number of persons provided with general qualifications is multi- 
plied. The number of candidates, without doubt, would be fewer if 
their ranks were not increased by crowds of young men who have 
taken the baccalaureate only to advance themselves socially, and who 
afterwards find themselves bound by a sort of duty to themselves to 
choose one of those careers to which their degree admits them as a 
matter of privilege. Nobody more carefully avoids what is below his 
rank than he who has been recently raised to it. In short, the bac- 
ealaureate, serving as a means of social classification, tends to accen- 
tuate among careers an order of dignity in great part arbitrary and 
contestable, and thus to increase the number of aspirants to liberal 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  careers; in fine, to prevent the diminution of this number and the 
thinning of its ranks. I am right, therefore, in saying that it mul- 
tiplies the unclassed (déclassés). 
Description of the evil in respect to that which is most grave and 
characteristic indicates clearly where the remedy is to be sought. 
If the baccalaureate seems to divide the nation into two classes, it is, 
- in the full sense of that term, a grade—that is to say, a ‘unique 
degree.” One does or does not pass the stage, and upon this depends 
his qualification or disqualification. He is wholly one thing or the 
other. Everyone belongs either to the portion above or that below 
this single stage; he is reputed the equal or the fellow of all in the 
one or the other division. Here indeed is caste. One enters by effort 
and the chance of a day, even of an hour, by a sort of accident like 
that of birth. Beginning with that, all is said, all is done; classifi- 
cation by examination allows no other difference, no other alter- 
native. * * * 
Difficulties in the way of reform.—A first erroneous conception 
brings on a sequence of others, and all taken together form a circle 
from which there is no escape. The fact that the bachelor’s degree 
procures marked advancement in the social hierarchy inspires ambi- 
tion in multitudes of young men who otherwise would not care for it. 
Naturally, the more the number of candidates increases, the more 
decreases the average of capacities by which involuntarily the examin- 
ers regulate the average of requirements. The standard of examina- 
tions tends to become lower itself, and there is danger lest mediocrities 
pass it in crowds. To stop this surging wave no better means is 
imagined than to make examinations more difficult, and for this no 
better means can be found than to make them more varied. Many 
times and much, since the creation of the baccalaureate, has it been 
modified. It has been reduced and divided into series. Through all 
transformations its programme has changed only to be enriched. At 
all events the list of subjects has not been shortened. At present the 
classical baccalaureate comprehends thirteen tests, extending over 
ten or twelve subjects, including four languages and three literatures, 
history, geography, philosophy and history of philosophy, mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, and natural history. The programme of 
the ‘‘modern” baccalaureate is yet more exacting. The idea seems 
to be that the dignity and convincing force of examination are to be 
measured by the diversity of subjects and questionings. 
All such expediests have been vain. The standard of examination 
is not elevated, but the contrary, as, in truth, it was easy to foresee. 
There is a point on which one need not be deceived; we have obtained 
what we desired, an examination that apparently stands for large 
culture and has an air of being difficult. It would be so, indeed, if 
the tests were serious. But to possess and be able to present ata 
given moment that array of knowledge would suppose in the candi-
-P-A-G-E-141
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 61 
date an acuteness and versatility of intelligence or powers of applica- 
tion and labor infinitely beyond the capacity of even an able youth 
of 18 years. The requirements are more than enough to embarrass 
young men of the best endowments and make their success uncertain, 
even though little is required in the different subjects. It is not 
desirable to expose such to the risk of failure; that would serve to 
endanger the recruitment of higher liberal careers; therefore the 
examinations are really made very simple. Thus, the able are sure 
to pass, but many young men who, for the honor of the degree, 
should be eliminated, pass also. Incapacity, ignorance, or extreme 
laziness alone fail. The body of bachelors continues to be a caste, 
but it is a caste discredited through the feebleness of a king who 
bestows the honor too lightly. * * * Examiners are, besides, 
made distrustful of themselves by a sort of confusion that is produced, 
particularly in Paris, by the great number of examinations and the 
requirements in each. After they have seen pass before them hun- 
dreds of inanities, they lose or nearly lose the sense of the limit below 
which they ought not to descend. They know no longer how to judge 
nor whether they judge well or ill. Like the razor long used in cut- 
ting the feathers of the goose, they have lost the edge. It is not 
astonishing, in this state of doubt and obscurity, that the conscious- 
ness of authority fails them and they decide not to put an eliminatory 
note on the record of examinations. The evil, therefore, is apparently 
without remedy, unless the baccalaureate should undergo an impor- 
tant modification affecting not only its form, but its nature and 
spirit... * + > 
Furthermore—and this is the second truth that the present system 
fails to recognize—the intelligent, laborious candidate has no need 
of so many subjects to balance his bad chances with the good, as they 
say. Let him have five or six subjects, and if he must take more, let 
those be according to his own election. This would suffice for him to 
acquit himself with honor. The existing system appears to have been 
created in favor of mediocrities. At all events, it operates to their 
advantage. It is for their sake that studies are multiplied, because, 
haying nothing to expect save by hazard, they increase their chances 
at every additional throw of the dice. * * * 
The form of the diploma.—The form of the diploma is an additional 
cause of dissatisfaction. The parchment bestowed by the minister 
carries no other mention except that the candidate has satisfied the 
requirements at examination. All other information is omitted. The 
6,000 bachelors who go out every year from our faculties of letters 
pear the same title, and they can call and believe themselves equal 
to one another. That nominal equality is most contrary to reality 
and verity.. It is surprising that the State should make itself the 
ratifier and consent to admit evidence so empty and so false. In its 
context, as it is at present, the diploma shows only that a mean has
-P-A-G-E-142
62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  been attained; it indicates neither the elements of which that mean 
is composed, nor how it has been passed. Take one example only: A 
candidate in the first part of the classical baccalaureate, on condition 
of obtaining a mark not even above 15 in other studies, can be abso- 
lutely nothing in Greek, history and geography, mathematics, and 
physics, or know next to nothing of any living language. The 
diploma leaves the public in entire uncertainty on all those important 
points. I am mistaken; for since no note, no branch of studies, is 
inserted in the diploma, the public, as it were, is invited to refer to 
the programme of examination, and is led to suppose that all of the 
courses included within that programme have been studied and mas- 
tered by the bachelor. Nothing could be more easy than to speak the 
truth concerning him. It is among the files of examination papers. 
It is hidden therein with care, and it is with deliberate purpose that 
one is denied precise and significant information that would be of 
service. The differences between one bachelor and another as to 
scope and character of acquirements may be enormous; not less 
enormous, frequently, is the range of difference resulting from the 
indulgence or severity of juries at Paris and in the provinces, all of 
which disappears under the deceptive, absurd commonplace of a uni- 
form diploma. To this the State is resigned and is encouraged to be 
at once dupe and deceiver. 
The foregoing considerations place us in the presence of a perfectly 
clear alternative. Either the State should refrain from interference 
and leave to every one the charge of verifying capacities, or else it 
ought so to provide that the title bestowed by it be of signification 
strictly exact and minutely precise. The best way to acquit itself of 
its responsibility would be before all to attest to ascertained facts— 
that is to say, indicate explicitly the subjects really known by each 
bachelor. That condition would be complied with if it were the rule 
to include in the diploma the subjects on which the candidate has 
given satisfactory answers, and those subjects only. An examiner 
who easily suffers himself to raise the mark of a candidate so as to 
allow him to pass would hesitate to do this if such indulgence should 
have as a consequence certification upon the diploma bestowed that 
the bachelor had mastered a subject of which he was ignorant. The 
more of seriousness in examinations and sincerity in notation the more 
the convincing value of the diploma. There are two considerable 
gains, and enough to make the qualified baccalaureate which we pro- 
pose of greater signification and merit than that now in existence. 
Optional studies mentioned in the diploma would add further indica- 
tion. They would furnish a more precise and individual characteri- 
zation of the intellectual tastes of each candidate. As to the marks 
“good” and ‘‘very good,” they would serve to distinguish and make 
clear among the multitude of bachelors those who are leaders—a num- 
ber not very numerous, but constituting a veritable élite. Effective
-P-A-G-E-143
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 63 
division into two categories, if it were made, would have this result. 
It would not separate bachelors from nonbachelors, but capable bach- 
elors from the ordinary and mediocre. It would distinguish from the 
mass not all that pass, but only those who pass well. For the per- 
sons, the faculties, corporations, and administrations that have to 
pronounce upon the admission of bachelors to certain employments, 
studies, and examinations, the baccalaureate would cease to be a 
vain, commonplace, and well-nigh insignificant recommendation upon 
which no reliance can be placed. At present it is nothing else. It 
would become a means of information, a sort of ‘‘état deseriptif,” 
which might be made as explicit, as exact, and as complete-as possi- 
ble. It would give information to the proper authorities as to the 
general competency, qualification actually acquired, direction of intel- 
lectual tastes and voeations, and would thus facilitate a more judi- 
cious distribution and adaptation of candidates for different careers. 
The effect of the diploma upon the studies.—I promised myself not 
to touch upon the direct effect of the baccalaureate on studies, but 
without contradicting my purpose I may consider the action at a dis- 
tance that the prospect of examination exercises on the formation not 
enly of the intelligence, aptitudes, and tastes of the students, but of 
his charaeter—by which word I mean constitution of will, habitudes 
that serve as its point of support, springs from which it receives 
impulse. Of the two, character is assuredly the most important, for 
if it is energetic and its aims are elevated it furnishes to a man the 
force and the tenacity necessary to subsequent completion of insufii- 
cient education, and in case of need it alone will create for him beau- 
tiful ideals of a useful and honorable life. To make clear that cap- 
ital question, one must consider what constitutes the moral worth of 
aman. That worth results from and depends upon the habit, slowly 
and gradually contracted, of looking at life, its surface and its depths, 
and regarding it down to its close as a series of obstacles to be over- 
come, of duties to be assumed and performed. That habit can not be 
formed unless at the age when he was eapable of understanding them 
aman has had a prospect, direct, clear, and open, of the greatest, 
noblest realities in this world, if education, far from interposing any 
obstacle between them and himself, has not been devoted to bringing 
them freely and largely into view. Defense of country, its colonial 
expansion, development of a branch of human science, free exercise 
of creative intelligence in philosophy and art, active energy in a pro- 
fession, are all examples of these actualities. The highest aim of all 
pedagogy is to so dispose everything about a child that he can see 
these without effort, in a manner direct and more and more distinct. 
Upon this condition only will it become natural to him, and, as it were, 
spontaneous, to incorporate himself with those noble ideals, there to 
mingle and enlarge his own paltry personality, to feel within himself 
somewhat of their grandeur and follow their conserving law in prefer-  
-P-A-G-E-144

  ence to his own self-interests. To keep constantly before the eyes the 
vast horizons of life, peopled with collective existences greater than 
one’s own, to grow to admire and love them, to accustom ‘oneself if 
possible to accept as a blessing, to regard as a sovereign goal the sac- 
rifice that one may make of his personal satisfaction—this, in its last 
analysis, is the substance of all morality. 
These ‘‘optical” conditions, if I may so call them, of all moral 
education the baccalaureate suppresses. Between the child and that 
vast horizon that it is so important to open before him it raises a 
barrier that intercepts the view, a low door and an archway through 
which he must pass for a price before meeting the divergent routes 
of manful activity. Instead of disentangling him entirely and moy- 
ing him unconsciously by the life whose contemplation makes a 
young man a valiant soul, and by those abstracting, distant pros- 
pects which excite and exalt his imagination, and those grand crea- 
tions of reason—country, sciences, arts, dignity of manhood, duty of 
a citizen, professional honor-—sublime figures, veiled only by a dis- 
tance that the course of years gradually diminishes—his attention is 
claimed, lowered, and closely fixed upon an object purely arbitrary 
and artificial, which responds to nothing in life—an obstacle, a sort 
of steeplechase, or, as I have said, a tollgate or a turnstile—and 
upon compulsion he spends his time in collecting and getting ready 
his money. Then he loses all chance that he had of perceiving great 
impersonal objects, of interesting himself, of attaching himself to 
them, to make them enter into the perspectives of his future. Of 
commerce he receives a selfish ideal, which excites within none but 
egotistic thoughts and constantly occupies his mind with a calcula-- 
tion of chance or with petty recipes and practices of a nature to 
achieve success. In that order of ideas examinations and competi- 
tions for entrance into different careers, however narrow and positive 
they may appear, are not like the baccalaureate, demoralizers; they 
open at least, one way to a certain type of useful life, embracing a 
number of duties. For those young men destined to a military life— 
in the Navy, for example—thoughts and dreams of the future are rich 
enough in idealism to satisfy the most exacting moralist. In the 
baccalaureate the ideal and the real fail simultaneously; everything 
is arbitrary, factitious, commonplace, transient, without any con- 
nection with positive, substantial ideas that the young may form of 
the life awaiting them. That which is placed in perspective at the 
end of their studies is less an end than a barrier to be overleaped or 
to be turned by force or address, and this end, unceasingly recalled 
by the nervous anxiety of parents, is made yet more mischievous by 
their commentaries. * * * 
It is vain to say that most young men do not look so far before them; 
it is at least necessary to afford them the opportunity. They should 
get a glimpse of, sound, and divine the great realities which every
-P-A-G-E-145
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 65 
  year brings near to them. - That alone would be an inestimable’ bless- 
ing, and more than abundantly compensate for the sacrifice of an arti- 
ficial and injurious stimulant. The direct action of the baccalaureate 
on the moral and intellectual future of a youth appears not less 
harmful from another view. If there is one incontestable truth, it is 
that the benefit of secondary education is not measured by the acquire- 
ments which a youth may prove himself possessed of when he leaves 
college, but by all the acquirements which that instruction has put 
him in the condition and disposition to make in after life. The total 
result at 18 years, after eight or ten years at school, is necessarily 
inconsiderable, unstable, soon fading, and, one may say, of the least. 
value compared with the total that may be attained during thirty or. 
forty years correspondent to the period of full maturity. That which 
is important is the long after work and its results; that which ought 
to count in the first education is what prepares and disposes a youth 
to regard the cultivation of his understanding as a work only com- 
menced, and to pursue it as one of- the ends constantly proposed for’ 
his manful activity. At present, as conceived and organized, the 
examination tends more or less by its effect upon the imagination, 
against which it is impossible to guard, to subdue and destroy the 
natural curiosity of the mind, to dull the edge of stimulants that 
support and keep it renewed, and, in fine, to diminish the sum of 
general culture in the majority of individuals. * * * 
In conclusion I will limit myself to expressing the profound con- 
viction which conscientious study of the question has served only to 
strengthen. Secondary studies have no need of the baccalaureate; 
‘they have only to gain by being independent, by drawing from them- 
selves alone their force, their attraction, their credit. If the lycées 
on that account lose a portion of their clientele, that is precisely the 
portion which it is desirable to see turn from them. They lower the 
standard of education and the moral tone of youth. The bacealau- 
reate ‘‘ordinaire” being estimated at its true worth, would be very 
modest, and when opening no other door except for one who has 
passed very well, or who has added certain special matters that he 
has really mastered, would no longer be the only goal for ambition. 
It would then seek its natural course; it would turn alike to the 
higher primary or technical schools; better yet, it would push out 
into practical life, which, we often forget, is also a school.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
THE ASSOCIATION OF GREEK STUDIES.* 
[Address by Michel Bréal.] 
GENTLEMEN : In calling me to the honor of presiding over this great 
society you have desired to indicate your appreciation of one who has 
been among its friends from the beginning. There are no longer very 
many of our confréres who, one day in the year 1867, met at the house 
of M. Gustave d’Eichthal, in order to lay the foundation of our associ- 
ation. You may not know, perhaps, what was. the immediate cause 
of that meeting. It had been bruited abroad that Greek studies were 
menaced in our institutions of secondary education. At that news a 
certain anxiety was felt by the friends of Hellenism. Egger, Brunet 
de Presle, Beulé, d’Eichthal (I mention only those who have since 
deceased), resolved to protest. Fortunately, the rumor was ascer- 
tained to be false, and it could not have been otherwise with a minis- 
ter of publie instruction like M. Duruy, who, while improvising with 
keen sagacity new creations that had become indispensable, serupu- 
lously conserved all.that was best in the university patrimony. Be- 
sides, with the best grace possible, he gave proof of his favorable dis- 
position toward Greek, for he made haste to enter the association 
wherein his name figures as one of its founders. 
No less impulse was given also for another reason. As the cause 
of Greek studies was, on the whole, the cause of higher education, as 
it was dear to all cultivated minds, new members were not slow in 
coming. Men of the world enrolled themselves in great numbers, 
regarding their adhesion as a duty and an honor. At the end of the 
first year we were more than four hundred. These figures were doubled 
at the end of the second year. I know of few associations whose in- 
crease has been so rapid. Wemust conclude that this was a response 
to the aspirations of the best representatives of our French society. 
More than once, since Henri Estienne, has been pointed out the 
conformity of French with Greek genius in one and another respect. 
We are conscious of that relationship the more sensibly since the 
progress of studies has removed the veil of respect, somewhat super- 
stitious, by which epochs of imitation had obscured the image of 
primitive Greece. Thanks to the researches of history and arche- 
ology, thanks also to the increased facilities of travel, we are to-day 
nearer to that primitive Greece than we have ever been... It may be 
that students in our colleges are not more familiar with the Greek 
language than were their predecessors at the period of the Restora- 
tion and of Louis Philippe; but this is certain, this which impressed 
me more than once within these last years, that Hellenic genius has 
  
1The Association for the Encouragement of Greek Studies in France held on 
Thursday, June 8, their annual public session. On that occasion was heard the 
Second Hymn of Apollo, sung by an artist of great talent, Mlle. de Klin. We 
reproduce the discourse pronounced by our colleague, M. Michel Bréal, president 
of the association. (Revue Bleue, June 12, 1897.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 67 
  become more generally understood—has grown more popular. At 
classic matinées in our theaters I hear young girls giving their 
impressions of a drama of Alschylus or a tragedy of Euripides. 
Excavations from Delphos, from Delos, attract to the Louvre or to 
the School of Fine Arts crowds of the elegant and curious. Through 
the statuettes of Tanagra, Greek sculpture is taking its place in our 
salons. Even Greek music, as we may perceive in our own time, 
affords French men and French women artistic emotions of which 
our ancestors could have had no anticipations. This is not all. We 
have seen the Greek dance, with movements that have nothing of the 
academic, become a subject of discussion among professors at the 
Sorbonne. 
One fact summarizes this whole progress. This year, at news of the 
fétes which were to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the French 
school at Athens—fétes that unhappily events have prevented or 
delayed—such a concourse of visitors was announced that the event 
began to assume the proportions of a national commemoration. 
Thus to the Greece that was little admired and revered beyond its own 
borders has succeeded a Greece better known, with whose life, whose 
habits, and whose customs we have become familiar, and which we 
admire more since we know them more intimately. 
Since it has pleased you to place in the president’s chair a philologist, 
it will seem to you natural that he should not ignore the Greek lan- 
guage. You will not reproach me, I hope, if I conduct you for a few 
moments to the past, since the present moment for those who love 
Greece is not without sadness. We shall return to it presently, if 
you will, after we have been comforted by a view of all the wonderful 
things of that favored land, yet destined, I have no doubt, for a long 
and glorious future. 
The Greek language has undergone that sort of change which con- 
sists alike in bringing it nearer to ourselves and in stripping it of 
that which is extraordinary and unique. It no longer seems to us as 
a miracle; as a sort of divine word created by the genius of Homer 
and the Oracles. We know that it had, as it were, a cortége of sisters 
which, after a fashion more or less exact, recalls its traits. We 
know that many centuries before there was a Hellenic people that 
language was already in possession of a great portion of its riches; but 
since science has replaced it in the environment in which it grew, we 
see more distinctly all that it has added to its primitive foundation, and 
also all that it has had the good fortune to preserve. We see how it 
has fructified its part of the heritage, and how it has filled up from 
its own spirit the forms that otherwise would have remained useless 
or inanimate. 
Let me mention two special felicities which, in my opinion, are 
attached to the Greek language, and which have made it— 
“Ce langage sonore aux douceurs souveraines, 
Le plus beau qui soit né sur des lévres humaines.”
-P-A-G-E-148
£68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  - One of these felicities was to have an epic poetry, a lyric, a theater, 
-historians, orators, long before a grammarian was born. That is a 
‘tare felicity; for if-you turn youreyes to other languages, you will 
notethat nearly always grammar has been in advance of literature, 
or, at least, that the earliest writers had before their eyes and in their 
minds the writings of a former age, words and constructions of 
‘another language, that served them for guidance and rule. To the 
absence of all imitation, all constraint, is to be attributed that ease of 
movement, that grace which is not conscious of itself, whose charm it 
is more easy to find than to explain. We may say of it what Sainte- 
Beuve somewhere said of modern romance, that it had the good for- 
»tune to escape the rules of Aristotle, Horace, and Boileau. ‘‘It has 
‘mever been imprisoned, and has known no other discipline than that 
‘which is natural; one’'may say that it grew up in full liberty.” The 
same is true of the Greek language. It astonishes us constantly by 
- its unexpected turns, its liberty of syntax, by phrases which in other 
languages would seem impossible or inexcusable. But the legislators 
eame too late; its constructions have passed for authority, have 
reeeived learned names, and been proposed as exemplars. 
The second felicity of the Greek language is that, for a long time, 
no one dialect gained precedence over neighboring dialects and 
beeame the official language. On the contrary, with a liberality that 
has never since been seen, the Greeks of separate states, separate 
eommonwealths, were mutual borrowers; the Athenians employed in 
the lyrical strophes of their tragedies the Doric dialect; Herodotus, 
though a native Aolian, wrote his histories in the Ionic. We see 
how that free exchange enriched its language, multiplied the resources 
of its poetry, added to the number of those turns which carry with 
them, as it were, the perfume of the native land. A lesson this for 
modern peoples to consider and one which I would commend to the 
Hellenes of to-day, who, while fixing their language, as is proper, 
would be wrong to exclude what the popular speech of the several 
divisions may offer that is racy and expressive. 
I need not say that these two happy circumstances would. have 
-seryed little purpose without the genius of that wonderful people. 
Thanks to that genius in times the most ancient, the language is full 
of expressions which speak to the imagination and which, like the 
eyes in some portraits, seem to make luminous the objects around 
them. Solemn or familiar, the Greek language has all: tones; the 
instrument, without effort, is found always worthy of those who have 
touched its strings to musie. 
I might add that one can not love the ancient Greek without hay- 
ing some tenderness for the modern, which, whatever some may say 
»of it, has preserved many traits of resemblance to its ancestor.: Yet 
it has not had the same felicity.. When it lifted the stone from the 
tomb and began to take its place among the living, models were not

lacking. It found so many things. to guide it that its own origi- 
nality has-been impaired. But it is only just to leave it time to 
recover itself. It will find its way to lie between those who would 
force it to remain a simple patois and those who would too soon 
impose upon it the uniform of our old European tongues. “When we ~ 
recall the time and effort necessary for the formation of French, 
English, or German, it must necessarily be very unjust to taunt the 
neo-Hellenie idiom with its-first irresolute attempts. 
It-is characteristic of our association that since the first day of its 
existence it has united in the same spirit of union and concord 
admirers of ancient and the. most distinguished representatives of 
modern Greece. Other nations have done as much as France for the 
advancement of learning, but one will not readily find elsewhere that 
fraternity which has joined in one purpose the sons of the Hellas of 
to-day and: the disciples of ancient Greece. If you run over the list 
of our confréres you will notice their names mingled throughout its 
pages. Only last year we had for president. M. Démétrios Bikélas, 
-one of those men who by force of character, patriotism, and dignity 
of life do honor to the nations to which they belong. In the list of 
those who have died this year and whose loss we mourn will be found 
‘the same commingling. 
After noticing anumber of distinguished members who had deceased, 
M. Bréal thus proceeds: 
And now how shall I avoid speaking of that which is present in our 
minds, and which weighs upon our hearts and consciences? It is not 
for me to recur to the beginnings of a conflict which, without doubt, 
it would have been possible to prevent, a conflict whose issue in other 
‘times could not have turned to. the detriment of Greece. To him 
“who compares Europe of 1897-with the Europe of 1827 there is no 
place for pride nor felicitation at the new orientation imposed by the 
‘diplomacy of the great powers. Yet, whatever be the present exi- 
gencies, while making proper allowance for circumstances and without 
pretending to judge the situation, which in some points escapes our 
examination, we have the right to lift our thoughts higher, to put our- 
selves at a point of view more elevated, which will be also the point 
of view of history. 
The war which we are witnessing is an episode in the conflict of a 
‘eentury. The lot of the people of Greece, since the earliest times of 
their history, has been to confront the pressure and menaces of the 
East. Situate at the extremity of Europe, facing the continent of 
Asia, that small country—the memory is of yesterday—has been the 
advanced guard: and the savior of civilization. Nothing that we 
possess, nothing in our associations, nothing that contributes to the 
dignity and value of our life, nothing of all these would have existed 
if Greece had not, by an immortal heroism, confronted in bygone 
times’ an enemy twenty times superior in numbers. Nor is this all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  It proceeded afterwards to find within itself, not for the pleasure of 
finding, but for bringing forth, all the acquisitions and treasures of 
its genius. Can we then complain of Greece if she has recognized 
her destiny in that behoof, if she has always held herself ready to 
renew the same combat, and if, as was said long ago by the poet 
Aristophanes, she has not the habit of counting the numbers of her 
enemies? 
Destiny, for the time, isagainst her. She is vanquished; she has also 
the mortification of undergoing a concert of remonstrances. It would 
have been more generous to have spared her this humiliation. Eye- 
witnesses professing to be impartial affect to hold an equal balance 
between the two adversaries. Butit is not fitting now to compare the 
personal virtues of the Ottoman subject with those of the Hellenic 
citizen—a comparison always delicate, always difficult, and which 
easily becomes delusive in arbitrarily choosing types. For the pres- 
ent, let us regard the two nations side by side. Then what do we 
behold? On one side we have a small nation that within seventy 
years has created a town like Athens, open to all the sciences, all the 
arts, where one feels himself to be in a complete European capital; 
on the other hand a vast, somnolent empire, which in four hundred 
years has produced neither an artist nor a writer, and which never 
rouses from its lethargy but to appall the world by the cruelties of a 
former age. 
Between these two antagonists the ultimate choice of Europe can 
not be doubtful. Despite the anguishing trials of the present, the 
future is for civilization. The close of the nineteenth century will 
not witness the humiliating spectacle of a return of power conceded 
to Mussulman despotism in Europe. 
But, before we conclude, the friends of Greece may address to her 
one last word. Wedonot doubt her, and as we have confidence in 
her, we say to her that she should be ready with an ample provision 
of energy, for she must prepare for another struggle, more formida- 
ble in one sense than that of yesterday—a peaceful struggle, where 
the victory will be for the most intelligent, the most laborious, for the 
one that is most a master of itself. Close neighboring to the Hellenic 
peninsula are nations young, ambitious, aspiring to the patronage of 
the great powers. It is here that thoughtful Greeks of to-day should 
direct their attention. If they wish to keep for themselves the 
resources with which nature has endowed them, they should not hide 
them from their rivals. May they make more and more fruitful those 
gifts of activity and intelligence characteristic of the Hellenic race. 
It is often that on the morrow of catastrophes come periods of prog- 
ress and abundant development. We say, therefore, to the patriots 
of Greece, ‘‘Let not your hearts abide in sadness. Have faith in the 
future. Justice is there.” IHeveiv od ypn, véueors yap.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
Constitutional monarchy; area, 14,124 square miles; population, 2,185,335 in 
1890; capital, Copenhagen; population (without suburbs), 312,859; minister of 
ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction, V. de Bardenfleth; chief of the divi- 
sion of education, A. F. Asmussen; chief of the royal archives, A. F. D, Jérgen- 
sen; chief of the royal library, Dr. C. W. Brunn; chief of the Museum of Antiqui- 
ties, C. F. Herbst; director of the Academy of Fine Arts, F. Meddahl. 
The liberal constitution, based upon a charter of June 5, 1849, was modified and 
revised in 1855, 1863, and 1866. The executive power is vested in the King, with 
eight ministers as aids; acting in conjunction with the King in carrying out the 
laws is the Rigsdag (the Landsthing og Folkething), Denmark is divided into 
provinces, varying in size from 221 to 9,597 English square miles; there are 18 
counties (Amter), subdivided into 60 districts and numerous school districts—2,399 
in 1867; of these, 1,081 in the islands and 1,318 in Jutland. The seven provinces 
correspond to the church dioceses, and religious affairs are under the superintend- 
ence of bishops, although there is toleration of all creeds. 
The State religion is Evangelical-Lutheran, and 99 per cent of the population 
belong to that church, of which the King must bea member. The centers of pop- 
ulation, Copenhagen excepted, are the 66 cities (Kjgbsteeder). The principal cities 
are Odense, on the island of Fionia; Helsingfor, in Seeland; Aarhus, Aalborg, 
Randers, and Horsens in Jutland, and Viborg. In Denmark proper the town 
population increased from 515,758 in 1880 to 663,121 in 1890, or 28.7 per cent; the 
rural population increased from 1,453,281 in 1880 to 1,509,084 in 1890, or 3.77 per 
cent. With a population in 1890 of 2,185,157, the pupils enrolled in city and rural 
schools numbered 231,940, or about 10 per cent of the population. In 1881 the 
illiterates to 100 recruits numbered 0.36.

GENERAL FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM.! 
. The schools, an establishment of the State, with a required attend- 
ance of all children between 7 and 14 years of age, are divided into ele- 
mentary grades of two kinds in the larger cities, namely, pay schcols 
(Betalingsskolerne) and free schools (Friskolerne). Inthe country they 
include ambulatory schools and people’s higher and agricultural schools 
(Folkehsjskoler og Landbrugsskoler), the last mentioned being a con- 
tinuation of the common schools (Almueskoleveesenet) of rural dis- 
tricts. Then there is a connecting link—the burgher school in the 
‘cities—leading to the secondary grade (‘‘ Real” and ‘‘lerde” schools). 
The former prepare for practical life, the classical divisions for the uni-

versity. The normal schools (Seminarier) prepare teachers for desired 
positions. The special schools include polytechnic, veterinary, agri- 
cultural, and navigation schools. There are also schools for the defect- 
ive classes. 
As in the other Scandinavian countries, religious instruction is a 
main element in the schools and the clergy exercise parochial and gen- 
eral supervision over all educational institutions. 
At the head of the school system is the minister of eetlestnatitall 
affairs and public instruction,’ to whom the bishop of each diocese 
reports annually concerning educational affairs of this diocese. An 
inspector-general for the whole Kingdom in charge of music and an 
inspector for gymnastic training complete the list of higher school offi- 
cers, who, by means of the reports forwarded to them by local officers, 
are kept advised of educational affairs throughout the Kingdom. 
In each rural commune or parish and in each town the adminis- 
tration of public schools is in the charge of a school commission.* 
Outranking the school commission in each district or subdivision of 
the county is the school board.’ The school council (Skoleraad) of 
each county‘ and the county school board (Amts skoledirektion), which 
comprises the school boards of the district, have control of the finan- 
cial side of educational affairs.® 
In Copenhagen the school board includes the mayor, a member of 
the aldermanic council, and an ecclesiastical functionary designated 
by the minister of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction. 
A director, or inspector, who is a consulting member of the school 
board (composed of three members), is especially charged with all 
that concerns the administration of the schools. Each of the wards 
of the capital has a school committee of three members.® Each 
public school has an inspector, who is a teacher. He has fewer hours 
of recitation than his colleagues and receives higher pay. His special 
duty is to.look after absentees and to notify the parents of such neg- 
ligence. 
1In this ministry there are two sections—the one for supervision of ecclesiastical 
affairs, elementary and normal schools, blind and deaf-mute instruction; the 
other for the supervision of secondary and higher schools, libraries, museums, and 
academies. 
* Composed of the pastor, as presiding officer, and two members appointed for 
three years by the communal council. 
8 This includes the sheriff (Amtmand); the district provost, or first ecclesiastical 
dignitary; and a third member, designated by the county school council. It gener- 
ally appoints teachers and arranges the programme of studies, although teachers 
are allowed much freedom of action.

and of several members elected by the towns or cities.

74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The law of 1814, upon which the school system is based, makes it 
obligatory on all parents that children attend school or receive home 
instruction. Fines or imprisonment are imposed upon parents or 
guardians for non-enforcement of this law. The State requires each 
commune to be provided with suitable accommodation for all children 
of school age, gratuitous instruction being given to those who can not 
afford to pay tuition fees. The expenditure per inhabitant for ele- 
mentary instruction averages about $1.54 throughout the Kingdom. 
For the maintenance of schools there are various agencies. Finances, 
as they pertain to educational affairs, are subject to the control of the 
minister of public instruction. The main support of elementary 
schools depends upon county or district funds, with governmental 
subsidies for stated purposes. Normal schools are maintained by 
State funds. Secondary schools and the university have their own 
funds, and are independent of the annual amounts voted for the min- 
isterial budget by the Rigsdag. The necessary funds for construction 
and repairs, heating, purchase of school material, and for teachers’ 
salaries in the elementary schools are voted by the district or com- 
munal authorities. The annual increase in teachers’ salaries, their 
pensions and those for the widow and orphan, are paid from a county 
school fund, which also supports people’s high schools, drawing schools, 
ete. This fund, formed by an annual subsidy from the State and 
from revenues from taxation and contributions, is divided among the 
counties, and is under direct control of the county school board and 
the school council. The former meets annually to determine the 
required amounts for the ensuing year; the latter sanctions its deci- 
sions if favorable thereto. 
A statement in tabulated form of the expenditures for different 
years indicates the total amount in the schools of Copenhagen, in other 
cities, in county schools, and in parishes during the years 1880 through 
1889. The average for a five-year period, expressed in dollars, permits 
one to observe the increase in every class of expenditure except in 
extraordinary expenditures for parishes and commercial centers, but 
this may be explained by the tendency of the population toward cen- 
ters of civilization, like cities, where there are special objects of study 
in view.

SCHOOLS OF COPENHAGEN. 
The finely developed school system of Copenhagen forms a general 
model for all schools of Denmark. The free and pay schools (see 
table below) of elementary grades controlled by the school board had 
  
1The presentation for the schools of Copenhagen and for the whole of Denmark 
is taken from the ‘‘Statistiske Meddelelser om Skolevaesenet i Danmark, Kjg¢ben- 
hayn, 1895,” which was prepared for the seventh meeting of the General Teach- 
ers’ Association (of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), held in August, 1895, in 
Stockholm. This association meets every five years in one of the three capitals. 
The statistics for Denmark- are more complete than at any previous period, and 
hence are quite fully presented in this essay.

    16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
33,000 pupils in the year 1893 (16,778 boys and 16,222 girls); in: pri- 
vate schools, 7,276 (boys, 2,499; girls, 4,777). There are ‘separate 
classes for boys and girls, although in the free schools and in the 
three lower classes of pay schools the sexes are educated together, but 
they are again separated in the higher classes. Each class—from 30 
to 35 pupils—has its male or female teacher, each school its inspector 
or inspectress, or vice-inspector or vice-inspectress, whose duty it 
‘is to see that the school-board regulations are carried out. In 1893 
‘the programme of study comprised religion, Danish; mental exercises, 
German, history of Denmark and universal history, geography, nat- 
ural history and natural sciences, mathematics, reckoning, book- 
‘keeping, writing, drawing, singing, gymnastics, and manual training. 
A marked increase in pupils in the publie schools of Copenhagen is 
noticeable during the forty years (1850-1890), as compared with 
private schools (see Table 2). Reckoned in per cent of population 
there were in the various years:

Thus it will be seen that, as compared with population, there was a

increase in attendance upon the Copenhagen public schools. The

  The gradual inerease in students in these years was followed by an 
increase in teachers, especially in those who had received normal-school 
training. In 1860 there was 1 teacher to 47 pupils; in 1893, 1 to 36 stu- 
dents. Women teachers increased from 14 to 504; men teachers from 
111 to 425. 
General regulations appertaining to teachers are as follows: By law 
of July 25, 1867, a commission composed of eleven members, appointed 
by the Government, attends to the examination of persons who desire 
to obtain a teachev’s position. Such persons must present themselves 
for examination, whether they have received the diploma of anormal 
school or not. This commission meets annually in Copenhagen and 
in two other citiesof the Kingdom. The teachers are usually appointed. 
to the elementary grades by the school board of the district, accord- 
ing to the suggestion of the communal council and the bishop. The 
public elementary school-teachers in Copenhagen are reported in the 
different years according to the examinations which they have passed, 
and it is interesting to observe the growth of the normal-school idea

Given the number of pupils in the years 1860-1893 in the Copen- 
hagen schools, it is interesting to observe the salary given. The 
largest salary for women teachers is 1,600 crowns ($428); the highest 
salary for men is 3,900 crowns ($1,045). In the early years the greater 
proportion of teachers received 1,000 crowns ($268), while in 1893 the 
amount of $428 was paid to the greater number of both men and 
women.

RURAL SCHOOLS AND THOSE OF OTHER CITIES. 
   The different laws which have governed the schools throughout 
Denmark are referred to later under historical data, and were cited 
in the report of the Commissioner for 1889-90, pages 520-522. 
The foundation of the common school (Almueskole) was by law of 
1814, which gave children between 7 and 14 years of age the right to 
gratuitous instruction in the common schools. 
The gradual growth of the school system for Copenhagen and other 
cities was referred to in the above-mentioned report, but statistical 
information for rural districts, as well as for some cities, has been 
lacking, owing to the fact that the educational authorities had not for 
years collected such information. From the “‘Statistiske Meddelelser 
om Skoleveesenet i Danmark,” published in Copenhagen in 1895, the 
following detailed and comparative statistics are taken. The number 
of children of school age in rural districts (including commercial cen- 
ters or trading stations) were:

Thus it is seen that an increase of 16 per cent of the school popula- 
tion was instructed in public schools; in private schools it doubled; 
the number not under instruction was only about one-fifth as large as 
in 1867.

Here, again, public school instruction predominates, and has about 
doubled in the years under discussion. 
Grouped in accordance with the proportion to 100 of school popu-

Jutland; over 100 pupils in 17.7 per cent of the island rural schools 
and in 8.7 per cent of the rural schools of Jutland. In the Kjgb-

of pupils in school:

  According to the law of 1856, if there are more than 100 pupils to a 
teacher, then a second teacher shall be employed. There are in rural 
districts 1,247 schools with from 60 to 100 pupils, 624 with from 70 to 
100 pupils, and 221 with from 80 to 100 pupils, and these numbers 
are under charge of one teacher. But counting by classes, three- 
fourths of the classes in rural districts have less than 35 pupils to a 
class. In Kjobsteederne the per cent is even less in some cities; less 
than 30 pupils are under instruction in one class. 
PEOPLE’S HIGH SCHOOLS AND AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. 
The above-mentioned schools are of special interest in these north- 
ern countries, as they greatly aid in developing the hard-working popu- 
lation far from centers of civilization. The whole higher school move- 
ment has been, in a sense, independent of the State, yet connected 
with it through the subsidies which aid in maintaining its schools. 
The work of private initiative, these schools arranged their plans 
according to general methods found in State schools, if such methods 
were found by the directors to be available. By the law of 1892 the 
Government assumed direction of the people’s high schools and agri- 
cultural schools (Folkehgjskoler og Landbrugskoler). Each recog- 
nized school was allowed 300 crowns ($80.40) from the governmental 
budget, average 10 crowns ($2.68) to each pupil, until this amounted 
to one-third of the fund for teachers and apparatus; but no school is to 
receive more than 3,000 crowns ($800), nor is the whole State budget 
to be over 120,000 crowns ($32,160). To receive aid, the school must
-P-A-G-E-164
    84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
haye at 1east ten pupils, and no pupil is to be admitted under 16 years 
of age. The boys, however, are more satisfactory as pupils when 18 
yearsof age. For the maintenance of backward children the “‘recog- 
nized” schools receive a subsidy of 20 crowns ($5.36) monthly in pro- 
portion to the half of the pupils of the last financial year. The county 
school boards (Amtsskoleraadne) arrange for the amounts, so that the 
subsidy in toto does not reach over 180,000 crowns ($48,240). The 
minister of public instruction has the highest general superintendence 
of maintenance and plans of instruction. 
The first people’s high school was founded in Redding in 1844. In 
1892-93 there were in Denmark 77 high and agricultural schools receiy- 
ing aid from the State. Other schools had existed, but had been given 
up. The high schools were divided in 1892-93 as follows, according 
to their studies: Agricultural studies, 52 schcols; natural sciences, 
73; land surveying, 59; drawing, 72; arithmetic, 75; Danish, 75; his- 
tory, 72; geography, 71; constitution of the country, 33; gymnastics, 
58; singing, 50; religion, 27; Sléjd, 51; foreign languages, 15.

Total number of pupils in the fifty years was 110,000, namely, 75,000 
boys and 35,000 girls.* 
In 1892-93 there were connected with the 77 schools 75 directors, 
170 permanent teachers, and 140 teachers by the hour, 4 directresses, 
82 permanent women teachers, 58 women assistants and teachers by 
the hour. 
Of the women teachers 2 directresses, 3 permanent teachers, and 8 
by the hour (Timelrerinder) had passed the teacher’s examination; 
29 permanent and 13 assistant teachers had passed the high-school 
examination; the others were without special instruction. 
In the fifty years since the opening of the people’s high schools and 
the agricultural schools between 1,600 and 1,800 men and 500 and 600 
women teachers have been employed in instructing the students 
pursuing courses here.®

A writer in the London Times, describing these two classes of 
schools, gives some rather interesting details, which are here quoted: 
Last Saturday (September 8, 1894) in a hamlet in south Jutland, not far from 
the German frontier, more than twenty teachers and leaders from every part of 
Denmark and Norway, from Sweden and from Finland, met to celebrate a double 
event—the one hundred and eleventh anniversary of the birth of Bishop Grundt- 
vig, the founder of the Danish high schools, and the fiftieth anniversary of the 
first of these schools. 
These schools are peasants’ continuation schools, which have had a remarkable 
success in Denmark, more particularly since the war with Germany in 1864. 
These schools, amounting now to 67, besides 18 agricultural schools conducted 
on similar lines, have succeeded in awakening the poorest peasants, the plowmen,
-P-A-G-E-166
86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  the hedgers and ditchers, the cooks and dairymaids, the sailors and fishermen, 
from their intellectual torpor and in imparting to them a wider and more intelli- 
gent interest in men and things. 
Grundtvig’s pupils, young teachers and theological students, have gone through 
the length and breadth of the land preaching an intellectual crusade, and by the 
help of homely illustration and apt repartee have succeeded in awakening the 
keenest desire for knowledge for its own sake. 
Out of a working population of about a million and a half 6,000 young men and 
women, most of them between the ages of 18 and 25, flock every year to these 
schools and there live a common life under the same roof—the men for the five or 
six winter months and the women for the three summer months. 
To enable them to do this the expenses are reduced to a minimum—about $75 
for six months’instruction, board, and lodging, including all extras; and the poorer 
half of the students, on the recommendation of a clergyman or other authority, 
receive State bursaries that defray half the cost. * * * 
Scientific education is professional and can never become the possession of the 
multitude. Children, perhaps also grown-up people, can be trained to pick up the 
crumbs that fall from the table of science, but intelligence derived in that way 
will only be fractional, will only become a demicivilization, a ‘‘ boyish science,” 
as Grundtvig liked to call it, and has just as little to do with real science as with 
real education. It is well to dilate on the means whereby all this interest is main- 
tained from year toyear. Science isof course taught, but that is not the mainstay. 
What is most relied upon is the lively teaching by the voice rather than by text- 
books, of the ‘“‘ humanities” of history, language, and literature, particularly those 
of the native country, though not to the exclusion of the history and literature of 
other countries, both in ancient and modern times. * * * The Danish peas- 
ant, after a winter or two at the high school, may, as soon as his resources allow 
him, havea winter at the agricultural or technical schools. The 67 high schools 
and the 18 agricultural schools are closely related to one another, being united in 
one common association. * * Not only the most but the best of the pupils in 
the agricultural schools have first been pupils of the high schools; that between 
1870 and 1880, when Danishagriculture was on the brink of ruin and it became nec- 
essary to turn from corn growing todairy work, and again in 1880, when cooper- 
ative dairies dealing with the milk of a score or two of farms were required in order 
to produce the finer qualities of butter for the English market, it was the bright 
ready intelligence of the old high-school pupils that enabled the requisite changes 
to be made with rapidity and success. 
We in England recognize for our middie classes the necessity of grafting tech- 
nical training on the humanities, if the graft isnotto wither and die. Grundtvig’s 
merit as an educationist was his seeing so clearly that, mutatis mutandis, precisely 
the same method was alike necessary and feasible for the humblest peasant or 
artisan. And so, as he had also the courage of his convictions, he had the happi- 
ness before his death, in 1872, of seeing his vision already a reality. 
Very many thousands of young men and women have by this time passed through 
these schools of citizenship and patriotism, and it is easier.to imagine than to esti- 
mate exactly their influence on the prosperity of agriculture and trade, on the 
removal of social barriers, and on the growth of constitutional and religious 
freedom. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Convent and cathedral schools, dating from the introduction of 
Christianity in 965, were the predecessors of the famous Latin schools 
established in Viborg, Ribe, Odense, and Copenhagen for clericals 
and laymen of the higher classes. The establishment of two grades
-P-A-G-E-167
  EDUCATION IN DENMARK. 87 
of Latin schools under clerical supervision dates from the Reforma- 
tion period. They admitted students from both urban and rural 
districts to their three or four classes. A third class of schools—the 
schole vulgare (Skriveskoler) or writing schools—omitted Latin, and 
were under the supervision of municipal authorities. At the com- 
mencement of the sixteenth century city schools predominated; the 
country population had almost no instruction except in the catechism 
from the sacristan or degn of the parish, who gathered together the 
neighboring children of a rural domain or ‘‘Gaard.” 
As early as 1537 the number of classical schools (leerde Skoler) was 
89 (in Seeland, 15; in Jutland, 24).1_ During the centuries which fol- 
lowed this class of schools decreased and institutions developed 
which were more practical in instruction, or perhaps their funds were 
transferred to lower grade schools, wherein the Danish language, 
instead of Latin, became the medium of communication. In the mid- 
dle of this century the classical schools were as follows:? The Metro- 
politanskoler in Kjébenhavn, seven Katedralskoler in Roskilde, 
Odense, Nykjébing near Falster, Aarhus, Aalborg, Viborg, and Ribe, 
and the schools of Randers, Horsens, and Hilleréd (Frederiksborg 
lerde Skole) and the Sorg academic secondary school* (Sorg Aka- 
demisk lerde Skole). The ‘‘leerde Skoler” were, as late as 1805, under 
the same general supervision as that of the university, but in 1848 the 
minister of ecclesiastical affairs and publie instruction had charge. 
At the present time the laws governing these schools are those of 
1871, with additions and modifications in 1882 and in 1893. The 
““leerde Skoler” now have six classes, and the students enter at the close 
of the twelfth year, remaining to the close of the eighteenth year of 
their age.! 
The average number of students in these classical schools is as 
follows in various years:

The decrease in pupils between 1863-1870 and 1870-1875 was due to 
the outcome of the war of 184.

a strictly classical school since 1849,
-P-A-G-E-168
88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
From that period the tendency was more toward practical instrue- 
tion.1 The private ‘‘Latin skoler” (the one at Herlufsholm dates 
from 1605) numbered 5 in the middle of this century; in 1882 there 
were 18, of the number 11 in Copenhagen and 1 in Frederiksborg. 
Among these are included communal schools of Fredericia Kolding, 
Vejle, and Helsing#r, the pay schools of Herlufsholm and Birkergd, 
and latterly a pay school at Ordrup. The number of pupils of the 
private Latin schools reported for the years of 1849-1863 was 1,007; 
in later years the higher classes for the so-called students and real 
students (Studerende og Realister) had the following quota:

The secondary schools, as stated above, include classical and real 
divisions. The former are divided into the philologico-historical sec- 
tion, and the mathematico-natural science section. Between the sec- 
ondary and the elementary grades are burgher schools, with courses 
in Danish, French, German, and English languages, history, geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, geometry, natural history, penmanship, and draw- 
ing. These burgher schools are similar in character to the German 
Real schools, but not of as high grade as the Danish Real school. 
In the ‘‘laerde” and Real schools the course of study is similar for 
the lower classes. The Real school does not require Greek; but three 
modern languages are obligatory. The classical (laerde) school has 
French obligatory for six years, German through four years, and 
that or English in the two upper classes. The following statistics 
indicate the trend of study for various years, whether toward the 
university or toward practical life:

    A gradual progression is noticeable in the number of students of the 
mathematico-natural science section, although the numbers do not 
reach those of the philologico-historical section. The so-called ‘‘ Real- 
ister”! outnumber all other students in the universities, indicating, 
doubtless, that there, as elsewhere, the tendency of study is toward 
practical life. In the years 1875-1892 (inclusive), 5,727 students were 
prepared for the university. In the period 1875-1888 there was an 
average of 261 annually, or 159 in 1875 to 406 in 1888. Of the total, 
4,538 took the historico-philological examination, 1,189 the mathe- 
matico-natural science examination. 
Since 1875, women have been permitted to enter the university, and 
from 1875 to 1892 (inclusive) 85 women entered. The percentages of 
students in these secondary schools, reckoned according to age, were 
as follows:

In these schools the year of study begins on August 19 and its length 
is 250 days; that is, there are 250 lecture days (Laesedage). The 
number of teachers in the royal classical schools, Sore Academy 
excepted, was 144 in 1893 to 101 in 1848. Viewed according to the 
professions for which the teachers were preparing, it is observed that 
persons seeking philological and philosophical degrees increased from 
1848 to 1893, while there was a distinct decrease in persons seeking 
theological preparation. 
A new order pertaining to the pay of teachers of these classical 
schools was promulgated in 1892. The rectors were to receive, with 
free lodging, 4,200 crowns ($1,125), with an increase of 400 crowns 
($107) in five years until 5,000 crowns ($1,340) is reached. Salary of 
the head teachers was 3,000 crowns ($804), increasing 400 crowns 
($107) every five years until 4,200 crowns ($1,125) is reached. 
Assistant teachers receive 1,800 crowns ($482), with increase of 200 
crowns ($53) every three years until 2,400 crowns ($643) has been 
reached; thereafter 300 crowns ($80) extra every three years until 
3,000 crowns ($804) is reached. The principal teachers must not 
exceed the assistant teachers by more than one-third. Similar regu- 
lations govern Sorg Academy. 
The King appoints the rector, the principal teachers, and adjuncts, 
who receive pensions in accordance with the regulations governing 
teachers generally. The minister of public instruction appoints the 
teachers by the hour (Timelaerere), and no one of these can become 
an assistant teacher until after two years’ trial; then the “‘Timelae- 
rere” may receive an appointment from the King or he may be retired. 
Over 56 per cent of these ‘“‘Timelaerere” receive 1 crown (26.8 cents) 
or more an hour; 20 per cent receive from 0.80 to 0.90 dre; others 40,2

As for the economic side, the school fees in the State classical 
schools were, as a rule, from 120 to 144 crowns ($32 to $38), with 
rebate if there were two or three brothers attending during the four 
years. In the coeducational classes of the Copenhagen Latin schools 
‘the boys pay from 6 to 12 crowns ($1.60 to $3.20); in the six higher 
classes from 14 to 18 crowns ($3.75 to $4.82). The registration fees 
are 4 crowns ($1.07); fuel, 4 crowns; sléjd, 1 to 2 crowns a year, in 
United States currency, 26.8 to 53.6 cents. The income and expendi- 
tures in the different years for the classical schools and for Sorg 
Academy is presented below. There are many free places in these 
schools.

  Real schools.—There have been classical schools, with object of pre- 
paring for university study, under the care of the State for years; but 
it is only within a recent period that Real schools have been instituted. 
In the older laws at the beginning of the century the Real or practical 
side of training was associated with the elementary grades, the first 
beginnings being in the forties at Aarhus, Sor, and Renne. Royal 
resolutions of 1855 placed the Real school on a similar basis to that of 
State classical schools for acommon examination. In 18381! there was 
a preparatory examination at the unjversity for those who intended 
to take special courses. In 1859 it was found necessary to have an

examination—of a lower grade—as a maturity examination for the 
real schools, that is, in such schoolsas did not seem to come under the 
plan of 1855. Finally, in 1857, a preparatory examination of a higher 
grade in the university was decided upon as an outcome of the grad- 
uation examinations for the Real schools (‘‘ Real Afgangseksamen”) of 
1855. Again, in 1881, all these examinations were done away with 
and a common preparatory examination (almindelig Forberedelsesek- 
samen) was held before a commission appointed for such purpose, or in 
the schools. The differences in the examinations were shown some- 
what by the fact that some students took two or three foreign lan- 
guages, while others did not. English is obligatory in both cases. A 
decree of 1882 gave women the right to take this examination. 
In 1891 a burgher school examination was instituted, in part equiva- 
lent to the former lower grade examination of the Real schools. It 
permitted children of confirmation age to enter the practical train- 
ing schools. This gave no public rights, but only indicated an exten- 
sion of the communal school studies. Since 1886 the State has assumed. 
control over this practical side of education. The Real school! subsi- 
dies are given to the communal and private Real schools and to that 
subdivision of the classical school. The examinations are controlled 
by the State and there is a Real school inspector (Undervisnings- 
inspektor for Realskolerne). 
The following table indicates the status of Real school instruction 
to June1,1894. Itisheaded ‘‘ Meddelelser om Realundervisningen,” 
put seems to include all schools where practical training is given in 
accordance with Real school methods:

Of the total number of students (14,847) there were 6,454 in the Real

the boys numbered 4,838, girls 1,616; that is, 25 per cent were girls; 
or of the total number of students 28 per cent were girls. As for the

  96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
To more thoroughly understand the course of study in the Real and 
classical schools, it is here stated that in the four lower classes the 
courses are identical, with this exception: The Real schools have no 
Greek and the “‘laerde skoler” no geometrical drawing or science in 
these classes. Attendance is from the twelfth to the eighteenth year. 
In the classical schools French is obligatory for all six years; German 
through the fourth class, although the student may continue it or 
take English instead in the upperclasses. The Real schools have three 
modern languages obligatory. At the closing examination a written 
French exercise is required, and the pupils give oral demonstration of 
the German or English language. The Real-school students who wish 
to go to the polytechnic or the academy of forestry pass an examination 
in three languages; other students in English, with either German or 
French. 
THE UNIVERSITY AND SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
The university in Copenhagen (with its courses of study in law and 
political science, theology, medicine, philosophy, literature and phi- 
lology, and mathematical sciences) was so fully described on pages 
534-536 of the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1889-90 
that only slight mention will be made of it here. 
Founded in 1479, it has 40 professors and about 1,300 students; 
women have been admitted to its faculties (except theology) since 
1875, when a royal decree accorded them ‘‘le droit de cité acadé- 
mique.”? 
A college of pharmacy was founded in 1892; 7 teachers are engaged 
in instructing the pupils. In the same year a veterinary and agricul- 
tural college was founded in Copenhagen, which has 22 teachers. 
Twenty-one agricultural and horticultural schools haye a course of 
study leading to the college course. A royal academy of fine arts 
dates from 1754; connected with it are 7 teachers. 
Institutions for the blind, deaf-mutes, and idiots are fully described 
on pages 542-546 of the above report. These institutions are national 
or subsidized and are under control of the ministry of public 
instruction. 
THE TEACHER: PREPARATION FOR POSITION; ASSOCIATIONS. 
The new Danish normal school law of March 30, 1894,” seems to 
permit the training of both men and women for the position of teacher 
in the State normal schools, situated in Fionia, Jutland, and Seeland. 
Private normal schools are also reported for both sexes; and in the 
last decade these were the only schools to which women were admitted 
when desiring to fit themselves for a teacher’s position. 
The State schools have, as formerly, a three years’ course, to be 
admitted to which the individual must be fully 18 years of age.

  Practice schools are connected. with the normal departments, and 
there are examinations from class to class. The final examination, 
after the three years’ course, is held by a board of examiners, who 
determine what written proofs of knowledge shall be given, with the 
minister of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction as chairman. 
The diploma indicates whether the normal student has prepared him- 
self (or herself) for general teaching or for special branches. Pupils 
of ‘“‘recognized” private normal schools pass similar examinations to 
those of the State schools. The minister has also general oversight. 
Admission to the State normal schools is granted after an examina- 
tion is passed. The written theses for such examination include 
dictation, Danish composition, methods of recitation, the explanation 
of a proverb, moral teaching, writing, arithmetical computations, ete. 
The oral examination covers questions about grammar, grammatical 
analysis, arithmetical questions, Danish history, universal geography, 
religion, and sacred history. Normal school instruction is not gratui- 
tous. Formerly the charges varied at different schools. Now 40 
crowns ($10.72) is the fee, but there are free places, and children of 
teachers have free admission. The State and recognized private 
normal schools (anerkendte Privatseminarier). receive annual sub- 
sidies for aid to teachers, school material, ete. The amounts vary 
according to the designated purpose, from 1,200 to 5,000 crowns ($321 
to $1,340). 
A law of March 30, 1892, also established a State school for the 
training of women teachers to fill positions in preparatory schools 
(Forskolen), where the children are from 7 to 10 years of age, and the 
classes include 25 pupils. Instruction from one to one and a half 
years is considered sufficient for such teachers. 
As an additional preparation for the teacher’s position, there are 
opportunities for travel, with consequent broadening of the mind, 
conferences and associations for the discussion of pertinent eduea- 
tional topics. For instance, ‘‘ Danmarks Lererforening” is working 
for the increase of teachers’ salaries, which are considered inadequate 
in rural districts; and even in Copenhagen the amount contributed by 
the State is not considered to be ample enough to repay the teachers . 
for their educational efforts. In Copenhagen the discussions among 
the teachers and before the board of education cover the need of more 
remuneration for young teachers and. for women teachers who act as 
substitutes, or who give hours of instruction each week -beyond a 
certain limit. 
The Danish ministry for ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction- 
has decided that in case changes are to be made by the school com- 
mittee of rural districts, that teachers be allowed a voice in the mat- 
ter. Every teacher may not act as a member of the committee, but 
one may be duly appointed whose duty it will be to present the needs 
and requirements of the district, if there be changes of teachers, new

  school buildings-erected,-ete. The Danish teachers’ association desires 
to have one of the district teachers.as a member of the committee, and 
to have all teachers of the distriet meet with the committee annually. 
The ministry has also decided upon an annual subsidy at the 
expense of the commune for the purpose of purchasing beoks for 
teachers who may be in need of more advanced culture. The exact 
amount of subsidy is yet to be decided, and it rests with the school 
board to see that the plan is carried out. The teachers are to havea 
voice in the matter, however, and to signify what seems to them most 
needed.! g 
For the discussion of topics of general interest to all or many 
of their fraternity the teachers of Scandinavia gather together, in 
general assembly, every five years in one of these three northern 
eountries. The first meeting was held in 1870 in Goteborg, and 630 
teachers from Sweden, 250 from Norway, and 120 Danes took part. 
The sixth meeting was held in Copenhagen in 1890, with an attend- 
ance of 3,000 Danes, 1,100 Norwegians, 1,000 Swedes, and 160 Finns.! 
In 1895 the teachers met in Stockholm for discussion of sub- 
jects interesting to those engaged in educational work in all three 
countries. The oldest association of teachers, “Paedagogiske Sel- 
skab” of Denmark, held its seventy-fifth anniversary in 1895. Many 
noted educators were present, among them the minister of public 
instruction.? This association dates from 1820, and its members at 
ditferent periods have earnestly discussed scientific, pedagogical, and 
practical questions. At first there were65 members. By degrees the 
association decreased in numbers.and at last became simply a gath- 
ering for social enjoyment. In 1840 a new-era was entered upon, and 
the discussions became quite ‘practical in character. Again, toward 
the sixties, there came a period of retrogression. In 1890 women 
teachers were admitted to membership. This association is now ree- 
ognized as a power in matters pertaining to the school system of 
Denmark. A library of 2,000 pedagogical works and a fund of 60,000 
crowns ($16,080) for the aid of teachers in Copenhagen are due to 
its initiative. There are now 700 members. 
On October 13-15, 1895, the Association of Higher School Teachers 
of Denmark met in ‘Copenhagen. They discussed the need of more 
time for the study of English and less for Greek in the secondary 
schools; also the need of teaching the mother tongue, so that through 
the understanding of the history.and literature a nearer bond of union 
between the three countries—Norway, Denmark, and Sweden—would 
result.

EDUCATION IN DENMARK. 99 
The Association of Teachers of ‘Girls’ Schools met for the third time 
in October, 1895, and discussed the need of higher education for 
women teachers, the object being to prepare them to teach in higher- 
grade schools. The pensioning of private-school teachers was also 
considered desirable. 
HISTORICAL DATA.

1478-79. Founding of University at Copenhagen. 
1537 on. Latin schools (instructing in Latin, Greek, religion, singing, and writing) 
improved and increased in number, giving one to each city; educational 
facilities lacking in rural districts, except as the clergyman of the parish 
gathered the children together and taught the catechism. Soré Academy 
established in 1580; changed to a Knights’ Academy in 1749, It is a strictly 
classical school since 1849.

‘rural schools. 
  
1 At that period the nobility had their tenantry taught on their estates by the 
clergy or by some one designated for that purpose. 
2'These decrees, the principal features being still in force, established two-class 
elementary schools in rural districts (in localities rich enough to maintain them) 
and two schools in each of the larger villages. If feasible, burgher schools, 
higher-grade schools, and evening schools for adults were to be established, and 
obligatory attendance in elementary grades was recognized as a feature of the 
school system.

56 ‘‘Fogderier,” thelatter comprising 22 ports (Ladesteder) and 494 rural com- 
munes (Herreder), which are mostly parishes or wards. The ‘‘Herred” is gov- 
erned by acouncil and a body of representatives three times as large as the council. 
The councilors (Formzendene)—3 to 9 in number—are elected from the different 
wardsof thecommune. These bodies elect conjointly, every year, a chairman and 
deputy chairman from among their number. The chairman, the ‘“‘Amtmand,” and 
the ‘‘Fogderier” or sheriffs form the county diet (Amtsformandskab), which 
holds an annual meeting to arrange for the county budget. The towns and ports 
form 58 communes, governed by a council (4 to 12 members in Christiania) and 
by representatives, who outnumber the councilors threefold. The members of 
both local governing bodies are elected for the Storthing by voters in towns and 
ruralcommunes. The chief functionary of each county and the bishop of each dio- 
cese are members of a county board which looks after educational interests. The 
municipal council votes on the school budget, and some members belong to the 
district school board; a member of each local school committee is a clergyman.

the committee. In smaller towns either a man or woman may be elected 
to the position. 
GENERAL FEATURES OF ‘THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.’ 
The department of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction 
(Kirke og Undervisnings Departmentet) has general control of the 
educational system, and furnishes a report every three years to the 
King and Storthing. Norway is divided into 77 deaneries, whose 
ecclesiastical authorities are vested with the higher inspection of 
schools and the control of school committees. The six dioceses have 
each a diocesan director and board, to whom the deans report. This 
directive board (Stiftsdirektion) includes the bishop, the chief county 
executive officer, and the school inspector, who is appointed by the 
King and paid by the State. The department of education expects 
an annual report from these higher school beards. For local super- 
vision, each county has a council which acts .as.a county school board 
and meets annually; the chairmen of municipal councils are among 
its members. A school commission (Skolekommission) in each city 
or district, which includes as members the pastors and vicars of the 
parish, a member of the municipal council, and delegates of the com- 
munal council, has immediate supervision of schools. Each school 
district? is governed by dual authority, namely, by the school com-

- vol. 11; Beretningen om Skolevaesenets tilstand; Universitets og Skole annaler, etc. 
? The ordinary school district has limits similar to the municipal district.

  mittee, which includes women, and is purely administrative, and by 
the municipal council having charge of the school fund. Each rural 
district (Herred) is formed of one or more school communes! (Shole- 
kommuner) subdivided into circles (Skolekredse), the size of which 
is determined by the communal school commission (Skolekommission). 
Each circle is required to have an elementary school (Kredskole), 
or there are ambulatory schools (omgangsskoler) if the distances are 
too great for the children to come. Formerly there were many ambu- 
latory schools, but by degrees they have been united with the station- 
ary schools. 
The different grades of schools include the elementary, divided into 
stationary (faste skoler) and ambulatory (omgangsskoler) and a higher 
grade elementary (héiere almueskoler), maintained by several Kredse. 
Secondary schools established by the State include middie schools? 
(kommunale Middelskoler) and gymnasia, then there are subdivisions 
into Latin and real gymnasia (Latin og real skoler). Private schools 
of a secondary grade (privat borger og pigeskoler) are also reported, 
The *‘Seminaria,” or normal schools, are one for each diocese; all 
public school teachers (folkskolelaerere) are presumed to have passed 
the normal school examination. 
The University at Christiania (Kongelige norske Frederiks Univer- 
sitet); special schools for philological studies, physical.and mathemat- 
ical studies; mining and forestry schools; industrial (industriskoler) 
and commercial schools; agricultural schools in most counties; higher 
agricultural schools (héiere Landboiskole); navigation schools; mili- 
tary high schools; military and naval schools; the polytechnic, ete., 
complete the school system. 
The schools are maintained by district, county, and State funds, 
the elementary schools being supported by a district school fund 
derived from interest funds, voluntary gifts, and fines; there are also 
State subsidies. 
The twenty counties have each a school fund to pay the increase of 
salary to teachers, contributions to higher schools, and to work schools, 
to erect school houses and to purchase land for school teachers, to 
promote education in poor parishes, and to further compensate school 
teachers. City schools are supported by the municipal district; sec- 
ondary schools are maintained by the municipality or by funds which 
have accrued to the department of public instruction and ecclesias- 
tical affairs from the sale of church lands. 
Sometimes the Latin schools have funds of their own, but the major- 
ity depend upon State and municipality. Normal schools are estab- 
lished and maintained by the Government. The university is

°These intermediate grades serve as a preparatory division to the secondary 
schools, and correspond in a measure to our grammar schools. Their course is 
referred to in the following pages.

maintained by the State or by its own funds, the student having no 
fees to pay. The agricultural schools are supported by State and dis- 
trict funds. For a summarization of the laws prior to 1889, see the 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1889-90, pages 477-481. 
The modifications of former laws, apart from the local appointment 
of teachers and a possible reduction of school hours, were not of an 
extensive character. 
Teachers are generally trained in one of six State normal schools 
or in-a class of minor training schools (Laererskoler), attached to the 
higher elementary schools as a sort of practice course. Public school 
teachers are presumed to have passed an examination either in nor- 
inal schools or elsewhere. ‘The normal course comprises religion, the 
native tongue, arithmetic, music, geography, history, natural sciences, 
penmanship, drawing, and gymnastics; there are also practice schools. 
In city and rural schools, according to law of 1889, teachers can only 
-be employed permanently when 20 years of age at least, speaking the 
language of ‘the country, and members of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Chureh. If not engaged permanently they may be dismissed at the 
end of three months. 
The settlement of teachers’ pensions now depends on the local 
authorities, which pensions are voted as follows: 30 per cent of salary 
for ten years’ service, 40 per cent for twenty years’ service, 50 per cent 
for twenty-five years, 60 per cent for thirty years and upward.: The 
teachers are required to secure annuities of 10 per cent to their wid- 
ows and 20 per cent in case of an increase of 50 per cent of the teacher’s 
salary before his 45th year. 
STATISTICS FOR 1892 COMPARED WITH 1889.1 
There are two distinct school laws in vogue in Norway, for city and 
for rural schools. 
_ The context of these laws for 1889 was presented in the Report of 
the Commissioner for 1889-90, pages 481-486, and the reader is 
referred to that Report, although points of the law are found through- 
out this presentation. The statistics available when that essay was 
published were for 1888. That is the year prior to the promulgation 
of the law. 
Compare them with those of 1892 or the close of the three years’ 
period required for the adoption of that law by the city school authori- 
ties. In rural districts a five-year period was allowed. 
_ The results of that law are here presented statistically. It is 
-premised, however, that the effects were supposed to be felt more 
- especially among the teaching fraternity, whose appointments depend 
on local boards, and in the course of study that of the rural schools 
being made to subserve the interests of a school population less alert

than that of the city. The gradations of the rural elementary schools 
are in two divisions; those of the city in three divisions. 
The children of school age in 1889 numbered 318,585, or 16 per cent 
of the population (of 1880). In 1892 the school population was 356,114, 
or about 17 per cent of the population of 2,000,917 in 1891.

112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  OUTCOME OF LAW OF 1889 FROM THE STATISTICAL STANDPOINT. 
An inerease in enrollment in stationary schools in rural districts is 
noticed, with a decrease in the number of higher elementary schools, 
and in pupils attending schools in rural districts. 
There is an increase in attendance in city schools of both elementary 
and secondary grades, while a decrease in the number of and attend- 
ance upon communal and higher schools is reported, although the 
girls in attendance have increased by 473, and in the secondary grades 
by 834. : : 
Pupils in the lower-grade secondary schools increased and the ten- 
dency was toward instruction for practical life (Real schools) rather 
than to fulfill the requirements of the Latin gymnasia. The latter 
indicate decrease of 115; the former an increase of 60. 
In normal schools the increased attendance of pupils is in the cities. 
Of the teaching force, an increase of 222 women teachers having full 
position and of 90 men is indicated. 
Both rural and city districts received considerable subsidies from 
the State for carrying on the lower-grade schools. The increased 
amount in rural districts was $116,461 from State funds and $89,834 
in cities. 
Higher elementary schools in rural districts, county and evening 
schools decreased in number, or were possibly transformed into divi- 
sions of other schools, for there is decrease in expenditure. Com- 
munal middle schools and normal schools received an increase of 
funds from State and other sources. -Increase in the stipends for 
traveling expenses and training courses for teachers, also in teachers’ 
pensions is reported. 
Art and manual training classes received larger amounts, while in 
industrial schools for girls, and apprenticeship schools there is a de- 
creased endowment of $5,611. For military and gymnastic exercises 
the amount of increase is $1,608. University funds are also greatly 
augmented. 
Viewed in toto the increased expenditures in 1892 over 1889 were 
$689,663, of which $189,622 were from State subsidies. 
It is stated that ‘the number of children in public primary schools 
of Christiania at the end of the school year 1891-92 was 16,914, there 
being 547 in private schools of the same standard, of whom 539 were 
blind, deaf, or feeble-minded. There were 5,084 in private and public 
secondary schools; 242 received private tuition, and 126, of whom the 
majority were ill or mentally abnormal, received no instruction at all.” + 
Owing to the provisions of the new law for primary schools, the 
different school boards fixed the scale of payment for primary teachers. 
In many towns, especially in Christiania and Bergen, the salaries have 
been considerably raised. 
1Journal of Education (London), May, 1892.
-P-A-G-E-193
EDUCATION IN NORWAY. 113 
In Christiania the salaries of the so-called “‘second masters,” who 
rank immediately below the school director, and of whom there is 
one for each school, have been fixed at $938, in addition to free lodg- 
ing in the school. First-grade teachers receive $643 a year, female 
teachers only $388.60. Second-grade teachers, male and female, 
reach the same salary after fifteen years’ service, their salary being 
increased every three years. 
Another result of the new law is that a great many more master- 
ships have been created in primary schools, for which, up to the 
present, there has been no lack of applicants, there having been a 
considerable surplus of trained teachers for several years. 
The inference seems to be as follows: The Government is develop- 
ing great interest in perfecting the school system; the teachers, 
both men and women, are to be completely trained to the duties of 
their position; opportunity is to be given them to study other school 
systems; training of both mind and body is a prerequisite to modern 
life, athletic sports being given a prominent place; the rural school 
problem is slowly being brought into conditions similar to those of 
the stationary schools of cities; school courses are to be arranged so 
as to bring about a more natural gravitation from elementary to sec- 
ondary and higher courses, without too much strain upon the mental 
and physical development. 
COURSES AND METHODS OF sTUDY.! 
Presented in extenso in the Report of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion for 1889-1890, pages 500-510, the programme of study need not be 
repeated. 
According to law of June 26, 1889, the special branches in city ele- 
mentary schools are: Lowest division, religious instruction, Norwegian 
language, history, geography, arithmetic, writing, singing, gymnastic 
exercises, manual training for girls and boys; a continuation of the 
same in the second division, with manual training for both boys and 
girls, natural history, geometry, and drawing. In the highest (third) 
division, religious instruction, Norwegian language and history, with 
elementary studies concerning national institutions, natural history 
with elements of hygiene, arithmetic, and gymnastic exercises, also 
target practice. 
In rural schools—law of 1889—the course includes religious instruc- 
tion, Norwegian language, arithmetic, writing and singing, with oral 
instruction preparatory for the higher divisions. In the higher divi- 
sion the same studies; also geography, history, elements of instruction 
concerning national institutions, natural history, and the elements of 
hygiene, manual training, and physical exercises with target practice.

114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
As in the city schools, backward children and those of feeble health 
are exempted from the full course, if the parents request it, and chil- 
dren of dissenters may omit the religious exercises. Special courses 
may be arranged, if permitted by the communal authorities for chil- 
dren who are incapable of taking the full course, the expense to be 
defrayed by the parents or guardians. 
There may be optional courses in the higher division, but additional 
hours will be required and not more than six additional weeks a year 
are allowed. The studies are those of the elementary grades or similar 
ones. The duration of the continuation schools may be from one to 
six months. 
In Norway, between the people’s schools and gymnasia, there is an 
intermediate grade of school, the sixth-class middle school!, based on 
a law of June, 1869, which aims to prepare for the gymnasia, and also 
to give a general education for practical life. There is an entrance 
examination, which has only been permissible to children who are 
fully 9 years of age, but, if suggestions of the Royal Commission be 
adopted, a change to 11 years of age may be made. 
The secondary schools—Latin and real-gymnasia—endeayvored to 
give a broader phase of education to the students, two-thirds of whom 
were Latin gymnasiasts and one-third real-gymnasiasts. 
It is stated that— 
The Royal Commission for Reform Movements in Secondary Schools has sug- 
gested a scheme for their better organization. In conformity with the express 
wish of the Storthing, secondary schools are in future to be a continuation of the 
elementary grades, and children are to receive elementary instruction till their 
eleventh year. As at present, secondary schools are to be divided into two divi- 
sions—middle schools and gymnasia. But while the pupil now enters the middle 
school at the age of 9 and remains there for six years, the new curriculum is to 
cover four years (from the eleventh to the fifteenth), that of the gymnasium 
extending, as now, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth. The Real-gymnasium is 
to undergo many alterations, but the Latin gymnasium is to be divided into two 
parallel divisions, with and without Greek. The requirements in Latin and 
mathematics are to be considerably reduced, while the native language, modern

With Class IV comes a subdivision into English (or Real) and Latin courses. In Classes V and

and VI English is studied for five hours in the Real course, and Latin for seven hours in the 
Latin subdivision; in Class IV the Real-course drawing is studied two hours, and in Classes V 
and VI of the Latin course one hour each.

  languages, geography, physics, and drawing are to receive much greater attention, 
and sléjd is to be made compulsory throughout the course of the middle school. 
This scheme was sent to the University of Christiania and to all public secondary 
schools, with the request that the professors and teachers comment upon it before 
the end of the year (1891) to the department of public instruction. The commis- 
sion states that ancient languages take more time than necessary, that in middle 
schools there are too many subjects of instruction, and it requests a new gradation 
of studies.? 
The university courses are liberal in character. For admission as 
a student, it is necessary to have passed the examen artium. Most of 
the candidates come from gymnasia and Real-schools, and are sup- 
posed to have a certificate from middle schools. The examining 
board, consisting of university professors, distinguishes between the 
“classiske examen artium” and the ‘‘real-artium,” the latter being 
sufficient for those who intend following a course in mathematical, 
physical, and natural sciences; the former is required of those who 
enter the other faculties. There are five faculties; the faculty of 
philosophy has two divisions—that of historical and philosophical 
sciences and that of mathematical and natural sciences, the others 
being theology, law, and medicine. The length of course is six years 
in medicine, four in each of the other faculties. The courses of study 
in agricultural, military, technical, and industrial schools are not 
presented, but there are theoretical and practical courses aiming to 
produce a self-respecting and self-reliant people. 
The blind and deaf mutes receive elementary instruction, and also 
education in certain trades. Defective children are tenderly cared 
for and, when possible, educated, the powers of observation being 
trained; the esthetic side is cultivated through pictures, festivals, 
ete. They have practical gymnastic exercises. 
Methods of study and recitations are as follows: The law implies 
that fifty or at most fifty-five minutes is long enough for the first 
recitations, and forty-five or forty minutes for later recitations. 
Recesses are interspersed with gymnastic exercises and singing. 
The school is to be opened and closed with prayer, reading of 
Psalms or singing. The text-books are to contain nothing contrary 
to law, and no religious text-books can be employed other than those 
approved by the King. Instruction is to be given in the Norwegian 
language, although in the Tromsée district? text-books in the Lapp 
and Finnish tongues may be used with those in the Norwegian 
language. 
Promotion takes place from class to class and from grade to grade, 
after due examination, which occurs annually in the presence of the 
school committee, the parish clergyman, and other persons. All

children over 9 years of age are expected to take part whether they 
receive home instruction or attend public or private schools. 
Pupils usually decide when in the middle-grade schools whether 
they intend to enter the Real-school or to follow the gymnasial course 
which prepares for the university, although pupils from both real- 
school and gymnasia are admitted to university faculties. 
Saturday is a holiday; on other days not over six hours in school 
are allowable, and for fear of overpressure the commission studying 
this matter considers five hours enough for girls. 
Three recesses are usually taken, two of ten minutes each and one 
of twenty minutes. Holidays and vacations cover twelve weeks annu- 
ally, although they may be extended to sixteen weeks in cities, if the 
authorities so decide. 
  TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS.! 
In July, 1892, at a well-attended meeting at Trondhjem, there was 
formed the first union of Norwegian elementary teachers. In the 
same month representatives of secondary and higher schools met in 
Christiania and formed the League of Norwegian Philologists and 
Scientists, the object of which is to promote the economic and social 
interests of the masters. The managing committee consists of seven 
persons, three of whom are chosen from among teachers of provincial 
schools. Only graduates of philology and science are strictly entitled 
to membership, though the committee has the power of admitting 
such nongraduates as hold appointments in secondary schools. A 
meeting is to be held at least once in three years, and in the mean- 
time the committee informs the members by circular of matters of 
general interest: The league is to be the organ of teachers of second- 
ary schools, and has already on two occasions sent in a protest to the 
department of public instruction against the appointment of princi- 
pal teachers not possessing such qualifications as have previously 
been declared essential by the department itself. 
On the 15th of November the Pedagogical Society of Christiania 
held a Comenius festival, the day of his death having been selected 
instead of that of his birth, as the latter occurred during vacation. 
Among the numerous guests were the prime minister, the minister 
and ex-minister of public instruction, and other distinguished people. 
Mr. Anderson, principal of a private secondary school in Christiania, 
delivered the chief discourse. He gavea summary of Comenius’s life 
and work, declared it to be one of his chief merits to have placed 
higher instruction on a national basis, and pointed out how we, three 
centuries after, have not yet realized, far less distanced, his educa- 
tional ideals. In conclusion he said: 
There is scarcely a pedagogic truth or didatic rule of the present day upon which

Comenius has not expressed an opinion, so full of vitality were his ideas, and 
therefore so profitable. To press steadily forward, that alone is the way to honor 
his memory. : 
The Rev. Mr. Romer, of the United Brethren, next delivered a 
lecture on ‘“‘Comenius’s Ecclesiastical Career,” suggesting that his 
profession might possibly have had its share in making him the great 
pedagogue that he was. He then gave a very interesting elucidation 
of the growth of the United Brethren and of Comenius’s life as a 
teacher, clergyman, and bishop. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING IN NORWAY.! 
  The movement in favor of physical education, which has extended 
all over Europe, had special development in Norway. It commenced 
in the hospitals, in councils of revision, in statistical lectures on medi- 
eal subjects. The effort was made through scientific and hygienic 
investigation to train children physically. 
The physicians have undertaken the medical supervision of gener- 
ations to come. The Government intended to order the examination 
of all school children in Norway, but the gathering together of facts 
was commenced in the public and people’s schools. Papers were pre- 
pared for each school, so that the answers of each pupil to questions 
similar to the following could be compiled: 
What are the hours of recreation, of class recitation, for singing 
and gymnastics? How many hours a day must the pupil work at 
home in order to prepare the lessons indicated by the teacher? The 
size, weight, and height of pupil? Is he afflicted with nervous dis- 
eases, headaches, bleeding at the nose? Has he lung troubles, scrof- 
ula? Is he anemic? Has he curvature of the spine, ete.? 
The hygienic conditions of the school; the health of parents; the 
general appearance of the pupil; age of father and mother; what are 
the hygienic conditions of the home? Are the maladies with which 
the children are afflicted due to home or school surroundings? 
In August, 1892, some 2,000 children (one-third girls) had submitted 
to these investigations, each one having been before the board of 
inspection three times, so that fairly correct records could be kept. 
Many considered these examinations to be an encroachment upon indi- 
vidual liberty, and in most cases the requests were handed to the 
family physician. Sometimes the answers regarding the health of 
parents, etc., were omitted, but the answers were such that it was 
possible to obtain information concerning the effects of hereditary and 
school influences upon the young Norwegians. 
Deplorable hygienic conditions were found. The long winters, when 
windows were not open to admit the air, the conditions of drainage, 
the horrors of alcoholism, all were investigated.

    118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
It is stated that physical training in these northern countries has 
been of such a character that it fortified and hardened the child, so 
that, for instance, if he were stranded on a desert island he might be 
prepared for such emergency. 
Exercise with the ‘‘ski,” or snowshoe, is in vogue instead of skating, 
and frequently a hundred kilometers can be covered in twelve hours. 
Even the dance is not a mere desultory pleasurable movement, but 
becomes a violent exercise with the Norwegians. The whole training 
of the child is toward self-reliance. Some idea of this training may 
be obtained from the fact that a child of 8 and one of 4 years may be 
out driving; the vehicle is overturned; they unharness the pony, lift 
the cart, mend the break, and start off again. Such is the practical 
kind of training that is given even to the youngest members of the 
family circle. 
The present movement is to more thoroughly elucidate modern ideas 
of physical culture, which tend to form an athletic body of people, and 
this movement is watched with interest, as it is conceded that the 
Scandinavians have degenerated physically when compared with past 
periods of history, when, in point of corporal strength, they were rec- 
ognized as the masters of Europe (les maitres de l’Europe). 
One of the sources of this physical degeneration is said to be the 
-lack of properly prepared food, and the northern races have suffered 
from this cause. So neglected has this branch of domestic service 
become that of late years classes in cooking have been established in 
most of the schools. Each girl in the elementary grades is given a 
sum of money by the mistress to buy what would be required for a 
meal. In addition to a practical display of the instruction given, her 
accounts are rendered on the blackboard, and thus serve as an arith- 
metic lesson for the whole school. Through experience the girls learn 
where the little economies come in from day to day. , Girls of good 
families go into the cooking schools to be instructed in domestic 
economy. 
The practical good sense demonstrated by the parents in thus giv- 
ing their daughters, no matter what their class of society, an oppor- 
tunity to thoroughly train themselves in the art of cooking is indicated. 
It has been said that the taste for stimulants! has been greatly 
enhanced by the lack of nutritious food, hence this branch of teaching 
in elementary grades tends toward preparing a home table so tasteful 
in quality that even the need of going to a general ‘‘ Damp-Kjokken,” 
for sundry nutritious foods will be no longer felt, and little by little 
the cause of alcoholism will be pushed farther away until the people 
  
1Tn 1833 statistics assigned to each Norwegian (women and children included) 
16 quarts of brandy per capita per year, and this was simply an average. In 
1875 the figures had decreased to 6 quarts and a fraction, but the evil aggravated 
by heredity had taken deep root amongst the people of that coldclimate. (Revue 
Pédagogique, aoat 1895, p. 146.)

  again stand before the world as a hardy, strong race, with no indica- 
tions of the possible degeneration of physical force which some writers 
indicate to be their normal condition. 
COEDUCATION AND THE TRANSITION PERIOD. 
An interesting report on the coeducational movement was presented 
in 1895 to the minister of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction 
of Norway by Hulda Hansen. A condensation of that report is here 
presented, as it clearly indicates the trend of modern educational 
movements in Norway. 
The Norwegian school system is for the time being in a transition 
state. The people’s school is a communal school, the higher grade 
schools are in part communal, in part public,? and they embrace the 
following divisions: A preparatory division (three classes), a middle 
school (six classes), and a gymnasium (three classes), which has Real 
and Latin sections. As in the other Scandinavian lands, Norway 
arranged its schools, from the Reformation period on, upon the basis 
that boys were to be trained for citizenship while a girl’s life was cen- 
tered in the home and family. The schools for boys carried on their 
education from childhood to manhood, while, as a rule, the instruction 
of girls was limited to the most elementary branches. In course of 
time girls demanded a higher grade of education, or at least such as _ 
could be obtained in the grammar or ‘‘middelskole.” In 1877 the 
principal of a private school for girls presented a request to the 
department of education for the promulgation of a law permitting 
middle school examinations for girls. At that date it was considered 
by the authorities that such action would bring the education of girls 
outside the woman’s sphere. 
However, in 1884 the Storthing decided more advantageously for 
woman and the authorities of several communes requested a State 
subsidy to carry on a grammar (middelskole) school of a coeduca- 
tional character. From that date on the discussions in the Storthing 
and among the educational authorities being quite earnest in char- 
acter, it was decided not to put any hindrance in the way of coedu- 
cation in communal, middle, or State schools. The coeducational 
schools render a more complete class division possible and more 
extended instruction for both sexes. 
The local school officials have interested themselves in the matter. 
In the smallest towns, where economic conditions have to be consid- 
ered, the authorities have proven the value of each step, new methods 
have been tried and the authorities have cast aside whatever did not 
produce good results, and they have introduced as a part of the sys- 
tem whatever seemed most satisfactory. These experiments rendered 
it possible for Mr. Knudsen, the chief official of the Norwegian school

  system, to arrange that there should be no absolute uniformity in 
methods, but that the best be chosen. The central authorities have 
observed these different efforts and have adopted whatever seemed 
best for the whole school system. 
As an outcome of these investigations, coeducation was introduced 
into a private school in Christiania, into some of the public Latin 
schools, and into twenty communal schools; also in several private 
high-grade schools in Christiania, where young girls are studying for 
the gymnasia, and in the highest class of middle schools in places 
where for the time being there are no girls’ schools of this grade. 
Many educators have interested themselves in the last few years in 
reforms in higher and lower schools for girls, and it is thoroughly 
understood that the schools have claims which should receive atten- 
tion. Both boys and girls have a right to expect aid from the State 
in obtaining a classical education. In that respect there is unity of 
sentiment. Some individuals take the ground that it is preferable to 
have the education go on in the old way, others discussed economic 
and moral phases. 
As for the intellectual side, coeducation has shown very clearly that 
a girl’s intelligence is fully equal to that of a boy. Special aptitude 
for language has been noticed among girls in some schools but less 
- aptitude for physics and mathematics; in other schools the reverse is 
the case. To date, more girls are found in the Real gymnasia than in 
the Latin gymnasia, for as yet girls are apprehensive as to the out- 
come of the study of mathematics and natural sciences. While it is 
observed that they are especially studious, yet they have less confi- 
dence than boys. Their industry has a good effect, however, upon 
the boys, and, in studying together, more rational methods of study 
are noticeable. Of course there is a difference in individuals, but 
there is no hindrance to the giving an equally thorough education to 
both. 
There is said to be danger that girls will exert every faculty for 
little purpose, because they are outnumbered by the boys, but these 
proportions will equalize themselves gradually. 
The following figures are presented in various years at middle- 
school examinations:

EDUCATION IN NORWAY. 121 
  If, then, coeducation is permissible from the intellectual side, there 
is still another side—the moral—and teachers admit that there seems 
to be no bad influence in thus educating boys and girls together. A 
species of cameraderie is engendered by this mingling day by day in 
school; courtesy is as apparent in the school as elsewhere. The pres- 
ence of boys does not tend to produce coarseness among the girls, but 
their presence has a refining home influence upon the boys. 
In 1890 the department of education and ecclesiastical affairs re- 
quested a report from institutions which had tried coeducation, so as 
to determine upon the merits or demerits of the system. No school 
demanded its abolishment, but each school indicated that such form 
of education is more economical, and from the pedagogical standpoint 
is warrantable. 
The general complaint has been that teachers are not thoroughly 
trained to carry on coeducational establishments; but the school 
authorities are strenuously endeavoring to improve this condition of 
affairs. A drawback to the coeducational middle-grade schools has 
been the seven-year course for girls and the six-year course for boys. 
The health of the girls was found to be so excellent that it seemed 
desirable to do away with the upper class for girls and to allow the 
boys and girls to pursue their studies throughout the course together, 
and to arrange the middle-school examinations in accordance with 
this plan. 
The investigations concerning coeducational schools proved that 
girls suffered more than boys when the hygienic conditions were not 
satisfactory; that they have less power of resistance than boys when 
epidemics break out, and that overpressure of work has more lasting 
effect upon the organism of girls than upon boys. In the Latin and 
real coeducational schools of Frau Roque Mielsen the thirty hours of 
school work are similar for both boys and girls. There is a separate 
upper class for girls who desire to continue a course of study leading 
to the middle-school examination, or, if the girls prefer, they enter 
the sixth class with the boys. Domestic economy and feminine handi- 
work enter into the course for girls. In the middle-grade schools it 
is not considered advisable to limit the mathematical course or to sup- 
plant it with work of more interest to women. 
The number of hours per week is thirty (boys have thirty-four 
hours), and sléjd, gymnastics, and singing are included for all. 
According to Royal decree of February 23, 1889, two higher schools! 
for girls have a right to hold the middle-school examination. In 
some of the schools the examinations take place after the ninth year. 
In the tenth class the course of study is as follows: Norwegian, French, 
English, and German, two hours each; arithmetic, four hours; phys-

in Trondhjem.

    122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
ies, chemistry, dietetics, and domestic economy, six hours; history and 
manual training, two hours each; singing, one hour. 
The girls’ schools have good hygienic arrangements; the maximum 
in a class is 30; in the schools from 200 to 300 pupils; annual school 
fees from 50 to 200 or 240 crowns ($13.40 to $53.60 or $64.32), which 
is similar to the private higher schools for boys. In proof of the fact 
that higher-grade study is not detrimental to the health of girls, it is 
stated that in the higher-grade schools (coeducational or separate) of 
1,500 girls none had curvature of the spine in a degree which required 
support. Arrangements are made so that students can have warm 
milk or chocolate if they prefer for lunch at school rather than to 
return home. In the normal schools of Norway, four of which are city 
normals, coeducation is a pronounced success. In the Asker normal 
school, 2 miles from Christiania, there are 18 men and 32 women 
students. In gymnastics and manual training separate instruction is 
given. There are two years allowed for finishing the course, but the 
practice years bring the courses up to six years. 
In Norway women teachers have a significant place in school work; 
in schools for girls and coeducational schools they teach even in the 
highest classes, and their worth is especially noticeable in the people’s 
schools. The need of a higher normal school for women is greatly 
felt. In order to perfect women in special branches for the higher 
grade schools a private normal school was established by School 
Director Berg in Christiania. To be admitted to the first division of 
this school the passing of the middle school examination is requisite.’ 
In this lowest division there is freedom of choice in studies. To enter 
the second division the examen artium is necessary, or a successful 
course in the first division, or several years practice as teacher (which 
would indicate satisfactory knowledge). From this division one may 
select course A, B, or C.? 
The outcome of the interest in coeducation and the strong demo- 
cratic movements rise to modification of higher school work. 
In 1890 a royal commission was appointed to revise regulations 
governing the higher schools. 
The question of the organic connection between the people’s school 
and the higher school is emphasized by the commission, a completion

to the gymnasia or Real gymnasia. The course of instruction covers religion, 
mother tongue, history, geography, arithmetic, and writing; the second half year, 
German; one term later, natural sciences and drawing; a year later, geometry. 
With the fourth year the pupil chooses whether he will follow the Latin or Eng- 
lish course; the former leads to the gymnasia, the latter is equivalent in part to 
the courses leading to Real-schools, Real-gymnasia, etc. French begins with the 
fifth year, but it is optional.

  of the common-school course being recognized as necessary prepara- 
tion for the higher schools; the commission also stated that foreign 
languages could be put aside two years or more to some higher divi- 
sion. Certain members considered that the foreign languages should 
be transferred to the middle school course (from 11 years on), while 
the minority considered that such transfer would satisfy the great 
number of pupils who do not aim to enter the gymnasia. 
The commission considered eighteen hours to be sufficient for study 
of the mother tongue in four classes of the middle schools (that course 
has taken from twelve to thirteen hours in the three years’ gymna- 
sium). Of the foreign languages, the lowest class in the middle school 
has German only, and English or Latin may be taken up thereafter; 
the minority advanced good reasons for taking up English rather than 
German; forty hours is devoted to Latin, to Greek twelve (it was 
proposed, as an exception, to have a three years’ Greek course of 
twenty hours, the Christiania Cathedral school being the objective 
point of such suggestion). Different views were held in regard to 
Latin; School Director P. Voss said for sake of discipline there should 
be at least thirty hours of Latin reading in the gymnasia. 
The commission advocated the need of practical arithmetic, and in 
natural sciences, the need of more familiarity with the book of nature. 
Some believed that chemistry and physics come more aptly within the 
circle of a child’s knowledge; others place the principle of sanitation 
and health first. 
There are therefore no new problems respecting the advancement 
in physics, but the tendency is to reduce the number of daily lessons; 
to have a new division of the courses and of the examinations; to give 
more stress to athletic exercises, and to approximate sléjd and gym- 
nastic exercises. All suggestions lead to middle school examinations 
and the artium. . 
For girls’ higher schools, girls’ schools and coeducational institu- 
tions, the commission suggests distinct programmes of study. The 
minority decided for complete coeducation as a part of the State school 
system, and all considered that experience favored coeducation. The 
commission favored similar appointment for men and women in 
communal and public high schools. % 
The minority suggested the giving women teachers an examination 
of the second grade, which would prove their qualifications for a two 
or three years’ course in university studies.

REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL CURRENTS OF THOUGHT IN 1895 IN 
CENTRAL EUROPE. 
Since the death of Kehr in Halberstadt, Dittes in Vienna, and other 
educational leaders in central Europe, other men occupying command- 
ing positions have taken up their work, and in the German National 
Teachers’ Association and the educational press defend the idea of 
popular education, and particularly the plans and principles of Pes- 
talozzi. Mr. H. Scherer, school inspector in Worms, is now regarded 
as one of the prominent leaders of the German teachers, hence 
it would seem proper to quote him on the subject of educational cur- 
rents in Germany. The article which is here inserted in English 
translation is the leading article of Richter’s ‘‘ Pidagogischer Jahres- 
bericht” of 1895. It must be understood that there is much more 
scientific discussion on educational systems in Germany than is gen- 
erally known, chiefly caused by the prominence Herbart’s theories 
have attained. The outspoken defenders of Pestalozzi, as was seen 
in the article, “Is German pedagogy in a state of decomposition?” 
published in the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education of 
1893-94, are apprehensive of seeing Pestalozzi’s influence supplanted 
by that of Herbart. Scherer represents Pestalozzi and that school 
which was founded on his principles, while Rein, to whom he naturally 
turns first, defends and advocates the pedagogy of Herbart and his 
disciples. The article of Scherer is as follows: 
Test all, keep the good, and should anything better mature within you, add it 
in the spirit of loveand truth to what I have tried to give you in the same spirit; 
at least, do not cast aside all my life’s efforts as something that is done and needs 
no further test. Truly, my work is unfinished and needs serious examination, and 
not merely because I request it. 
With these words, the past master of German school pedagogy and 
German public education, Father Pestalozzi, closed his last work, his 
swan’s song. It is his last will, his pedagogical legacy to his suc- 
eessors; Harnisch and Diesterweg, Herbart and Beneke, Ziller and 
Dittes, Dérpfeld and Kehr, and many other learned men and teach- 
ers have worked at its fulfillment. Still their labor goes on, and yet 
the work is unfinished. The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary 
of the master’s birthday invites everyone who is working to carry out 
his will, in developing the theory and practice of education according 
to the sense and spirit of the master, to examine all that has been 
accomplished in the fulfillment of Pestalozzi’s pedagogical testament, 
and to see what task is set before the teachers of our time in regard 
to the further development of the science and art of pedagogy in the 
sense and spirit of Pestalozzi.
-P-A-G-E-207
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 127 
  Pestalozzi invites us to an earnest test of his principles, so that the 
transient may be separated from the lasting, the accidental from the 
essential, that the former may be set aside and the latter developed 
toward ultimate perfection. This test is necessary for a firm founda- 
tion of the science of education and art of teaching; for, despite his 
genial and tolerant nature, Pestalozzi was a man with human faults 
and weaknesses. As a product of his time, his development, the for- 
mation of his views of life and the world, and hence also his educa- 
tional opinions, were influenced by the spirit, science, art, and 
philsophy of his time. 
In studying the advancement of the science of education we must 
first of all learn to know the history of pedagogical development in its - 
connection with the development of culture and intellectual life, and 
understand the development itself in this sense; for, as intellectual 
movements that have once become powerful and influential never die 
out, but continue to affect future generations in some way, the thought 
and action of the present time is to be understood only by a study 
of the past. The formations of the present are determined by those of 
the past. 
If pedagogy is more than a systematically arranged body of rules 
for school education; if it is a science and an art which by conclusive 
tests gives us a theory of art founded firmly on science (by means of 
which an intentional and regular education of mankind, according to 
both nature and civilization, is made possible), it must be studied 
from this point of view. If education is more than an intentional 
and well-planned directive action, which makes the individual attain 
anatural and civilizing development; if education also strives to make 
the individual a member of the social body, it must be regarded as a 
science and history of development which stands in closest connection 
with that of social culture and national intellectual life—which life 
reacts upon education and influences the formation of educational 
systems. 
Twenty years have passed since the appearance of the last edition of 
Dr. Karl Schmidt’s Geschichte der Padagogik in weltgeschichtlicher 
Entwicklung und im organischen Zusammenhange mit dem Kultur- 
leben der Vélker. Since that time much has been contributed to 
this subject, and we do not think that Professor Rein is justified in 
saying in his introduction to his Eneyklopidisches Handbuch der 
Pidagogik that— 
In the province of historical pedagogy we are just at the beginning of scientific 
work. First the earliest references must be looked up and sifted, then written up 
in monographs in which the intellectual movements of the period in question are 
brought out, before a well-founded scientific condensation of facts can be effected. 
The same remarks apply to every scientific, especially to every his- 
toric, condensation of facts. In every case the condensation will be 
the more successful the more carefully and completely the sources of 
information have been examined. In the history of pedagogy, as 
applied to elementary education and to public-school systems, much 
has been done in the last twenty-five years, particularly in regard to 
research and the examination and revision of earlyreferences. Classic 
works of educators of the past have been published anew as original 
sources, the matters contained in them having been sifted and the 
essential and valuable separated from the accidental and worthless, 
and the authors’ place with reference to the social culture and intel- 
lectual life of their times has been defined by prefacing their works by 
fitting introductions. The publication of school regulations, statutes
-P-A-G-E-208
128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  and histories of separate States and cities, has finally furnished the 
material for an almost complete history of schools. 
There are still many deficiencies, it is true. Much work remains to 
be done, and many a valuable source of information must be made 
accessible. On the other hand, in some cases the mark has been over- 
reached and many worthless rocks have been dug up instead of ore, 
owing to the religious bias of the compilers. A careful separation of 
the valuable and essential from the worthless and accidental is posi- 
tively necessary. In this case scientific and not religious considera- 
tions must decide. 
With the aid of these early references of pedagogy and the history 
- of schools, in connection with the history of social culture and intel- 
lectual life, our time can produce a comprehensive work on the his- 
tory of educational development and school systems in which the 
causal connection between social culture, or intellectual life, and 
pedagogical theory and practice is clearly and definitely set forth. 
The history of civilization, therefore, becomes auxiliary to pedagogy. 
“Science and schools,” says Professor Faulmann, in his History of Sciences, 
‘have challenged each other; science gives to schools better matters and better 
teachers. Schools give to science better disciples. This examination of pedagogy 
brings us to a clear perception of the fact that educational development is a dis- 
tinct branch of the development in general of all social culture, and that it is 
intimately associated with the philosophical views of life and the universe. 
Parallel with these changes, ramifications, and the expansion of philosophical 
views during the course of centuries the problem of education has been differently 
understood during different periods, and different solutions have been advanced.”! 
Only when the history of pedagogy begins to deal with the facts 
underlying theory and practice in connection with the intellectual 
movements and currents that give direction to educational activity 
ean the historian of pedagogy give a true idea of its development; 
then alone can he judge individuals, thought, and separate facts from 
the standpoint of the civilization of the time; then alone can he judge 
the master, together with his disciples and antagonists, during and 
after his time; then, and then alone, can we understand the peda- 
gogical phenomena of the present and comprehend them in their 
origin and development; only then can pedagogical science render 
its best service to pedagogical practice, to the educator and teacher. 
‘““When it shows the teacher,” says Professor Ziegler in his History of Peda- 
gogy, ‘how deeply rooted are the regulations which he must carry out, and that 
they are most intimately connected with the culture of his nation, he will rever- 
eace them and interpret them correctly. He thus learns that they can not be set 
aside or changed at the option of any one individual, be he the mightiest in the 
land, and that their arbitrary violation or sudden change can not take place with- 
out great detriment to the whole system.” 
From such a presentation of the history of educational development 
we shall clearly recognize, on the one hand, that many a thought comes 
to light in the changes of theories and methods at present as alto- 
gether new, whereas they have been presented before and have not 
stood the practical test, because they were intrinsically wrong or, per- 
haps, the time was not ripe or not fully prepared for their comprehen- 
sion and practical application, or perhaps these ideas failed owing to 
the obstacles put in their way by the animosity and jealousy of favored 
cotemporaries, who either saw their position endangered by a new 
doctrine which they failed to understand or practically carry out, or 
because they feared to be aroused from a sweet, dreamy existence.

-P-A-G-E-209
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 129 
  On the other hand, we also recognize that every civilization is gov- 
med by an evolutionary development from the imperfect toward the 
erfect; that, therefore, all our views on education and teaching and 
chool systems are subject to constant change for the better. Itisa 
ign of a want of historical understanding to suppose that any man, 
e he Herbart or Pestalozzi, Ziller or Diesterweg, Dérpfeld or Dittes, 
has framed something totally new, the highest and best for all times, 
land beyond which there is no progress possible. 
The intellectual greatness of a man consists in his understanding more clearly 
than others the moving powers of the intellectual progress of his time and in col- 
ilecting these powers within himself, and being thereby enabled to define or change 
their direction by his own strength of mind in so far as it is possible within the 
line of the popular will. 
True pedagogy is progressive pedagogy, which advances with the 
development of social culture and intellectual life. 
Should we find that once again a period has become ‘‘old” and that a new one 
draws near, we can not in consequence conceal the fact that this new period will 
manifest other needs, will define other aims for their satisfaction, and will seek and 
devise other means for the attainment of these aims. However, this thought will 
not depress us. We shall try to understand it, and do our duty with a certain 
resignation during the unfavorable transition period. In the service of the old, 
but with knowledge of the direction that points out the new to be followed, let 
us resolve upon vindicating what exists, but not restrict ourselves to it because it 
has been tried and still exists; for, truly, all that is, is not within reason, and not 
all that is, deserves to be counted worthy to be. (Professor Ziegler.) 
Such a history of pedagogical development leads us up to present 
times, consequently acquaints us with the present currents, with 
present aspiration and actual work in the field of pedagogy and its 
auxiliary sciences. The farther we are away from the civilization 
and intellectual life of the past, or the looser its causal connection is 
with the civilization of the present, the less consideration will be 
given to its pedagogy and school systems. On the other hand, the 
nearer we approach the present, and the more organically civilization 
and intellectual life, including its pedagogy and school systems, are 
connected with the phenomena of our times, the more minutely must 
we observe these phenomena. Therefore the entire civilization and 
intellectual life of pedagogy and school of the present century, which 
begins with the appearance of Kant, Goethe, Schiller, and Pestalozzi, 
will receive the greater part of our attention. 
The present duty of pedagogy, as a science and an art, is to per- 
fect this history of educational development on every side to the 
present day, to frame a system of education based on this fundamen- 
tal work, and to molding the education and teaching of our times. 
In this work we are supported by all who are occupied with the con- 
struction and development of the fundamental and auxiliary sciences 
of pedagogy. To these belong all the sciences, for they all bear some 
relation to education. They acquaint us either with the object, end, 
and course, or with the conditions and means of a natural and scien- 
tific education and culture. The histories of philosophy and anthro- 
pology, dietetics, logic, and ethics belong to the fundamental sciences 
of pedagogy, which acquaint us with the object, end, and course of 
education and culture. 
Anthropology investigates the ground in which the foundation is 
laid; dietetics, logic, and ethics define the structure that is to be 
reared. The fundamental sciences have risen during the second half 
of the present century, and their rise must influence pedagogy even 
unto further future development. This rise is also traceable to the 
ED 97—_9

130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  rise of natural philosophy, brought about particularly by Darwin an 
his disciples, which influenced physiology and indirectly psychology} 
As man is a distinet form in the evolution of organic life, so body an 
soul are endowed with evolutionary powers which man has the abilit 
to understand. Furthermore, it can not be denied that, within cer 
tain limits, the soul-life of a child develops in an analogous manner t 
the soul-life of the animal, and that the only difference between th 
development of man and animals lies in the tempo and degree of late 
realizations of the acts of memory. 
In the beginning, and particularly by Moleschott and kindred 
writers, the results of investigation in natural philosophy and physi 
ology were made to subserve the materialism born of the meage 
idealism of Hegel’s philosophy; soon after, however, Lotze, Fechner, 
and others, quoted them in support of purely idealistic philosophy. 
Actually, scientific psychological investigation was begun by Herba: 
and Beneke by the establishment of a system of psychology in which 
the old theory of ‘‘faculties of the mind” found no place. Both hay 
shown the course which this science must pursue to be successful i 
further expansion. This course can not merely be a collection o: 
observations, but must frame laws by which psychological oceur. 
renees can be explained. But we must not forget that the psychology 
of Herbart, based as it is upon metaphysics and governed by law: 
founded only on mathematics, modified by the philosophy and science 
of his time, has a tendency to be one-sided and fragmentary, so that, 
to-day, it can no longer be accepted as the scientific psychology which] 
meets the demands of our time. ‘‘We can hardly consent now tol 
the proposition that psychology must rest on mathematics.” (Hein- 
rich, in ‘Die moderne physiologische Psychologie.”) 
On the other hand, psychological laws can not be developed from 
mental phenomena, purely as such. 
Efforts have proved that it is impossible to establish a system which from the’ 
very beginning developed from psychological principles alone and in conformity 
with psychological laws. There can be no laws which may be defined as unquali- 
fied psychological laws, or for which there can be any other foundation than the 
physiological action in the human nervous system. (Heinrich: ‘Die moderne 
physiologische Psychologie.”’) 
Natural science, and particularly physiology, must furnish the foun- 
dation for psychology. From them, and not from metaphysies and 
mathematies, as a basis, psychological laws must arise. Beneke 
already pursued this course in psychological investigation and thus 
constructed a psychology which meets the present demands of scien- 
tifie investigation much better than that of Herbart. However, in 
this ease also, owing to the prevailing philosophy and seience of his 
time, metaphysical speculations play an important rdle in Beneke’s 
psychology, and interfere with its advancement in conjunction with 
the progress of natural science and the philosophy of ourtimes. The 
all-powerful influence of the then prevailing philosophy, under which 
Beneke fought his battle for existence, prevented the development of 
his psychology, if it is possible for a finished system to develop. The 
rapid growth of natural science in late years, combined with the great 
impetus of discoveries of facts and methods has infused new life into 
philosophy and more especially into psychology and ethies. Thelabors 
in the field of physiology particularly exerted a direct influence on 
psychology. 
We have already mentioned Lotze as breaking the way for modern 
purely ideal philosophy, in which physiological investigation becomes
-P-A-G-E-211
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 131 
more and more independent of metaphysical speculation and brings 
new facts constantly to light and endeavors to approach nearer the 
first cause of psychological phenomena and laws with the help of 
physiology. Physiological psychology, which makes use of experi- 
ments in its investigations and looks up, establishes, and fixes its laws 
according to scientific methods, offers the firmest foundation possible. 
Wundt, Ziehen and Kilpe, after Lotze, have been actively engaged in 
the development of this psychology. They justify real and ideal 
demands, show the reciprocal action between the physical and psy- 
chieal, and at the same time observe the relative independence of 
each of the two sciences. They base their laws upon the results of 
experiments and not upon metaphysical speculation, and do not pre- 
vent the philosophical condensation of acquired cognition into a 
finished system. That which is to be desired has not been attained 
throughout. That many errors are interspersed, many omissions to 
be supplied, and many problems yet to be solved, no one will dispute. 
Neither can it be denied that in the zeal of scientific investigation, and 
under pressure of one-sided idealism, and its resultant one-sided 
realism, the normal mark was overreached and the structure in its 
foundatiow was suppesed to be complete. 
To completely displace and supplant the earlier method of self- 
observation by the experimental method is certainly an erroneous 
procedure. But this overvaluation has already been recognized, and 
the ‘‘subjective linguistie method,” dependent upon observation of 
self and others, has received due consideration in connection with the 
experimental ‘“‘ psycho-physical method,” so that it is reasonable to 
hope that a complete and true idea of the development of the human 
soul may yet be obtained. In this way we shall arrive at a psychol- 
ogy which derives its laws from material experimentally acquired 
without regard to metaphysical presuppositions, as these observations 
essentially refer to the same individual, and every report of an obser- 
vation is immediately controlled by many. The resulting laws are, 
in consequence, incontrovertible. The hypotheses, still necessary for 
the uninterrupted development of this psychology, do not directly 
affect the laws acquired ; they are of importance to the psychological 
investigator only, and not to the practical educator, for whom psy- 
chology is only an auxiliary science. 
Pedagogy has a large interest in the establishment of such a psy- 
ehology, so that it may receive a firm foundation and become a science 
in the true sense of the term, treating of the intellectual development 
of the child and of the art and manner of taking hold of his develop- 
ment with clearly understood purpose and well-defined regularity 
and directing it, mainly by instruction, toward its ethical end. But 
even at the present day empiric physiological psychology gives to 
pedagogy so many positive fixed laws, derived from facts gained by 
observation, that it may be very well satisfied with their realization. 
Empiric psychology teaches that thought and action primarily depend 
upon sensations or impressions through the senses; hence pedagog 
must give particular attention to a well-designed and systematic selee- 
tion and order of sense perceptions and their consequent conceptions. 
How instructive for the teacher is the fact, brought to light by experi- 
mental examination, that if the mind is fixed upon a particular impres- 
sion and, consequently, is in a state of attention and expectation, the 
process of clear perception is reduced to a minimal limit of time. 
How promising for the teacher are the experimental investigations 
of association and associative reproduction. If empiric psychology
-P-A-G-E-212
132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  teaches that there are no innate and independent emotions, but that 
emotions are connected with thought perceptions and are called into 
being together with them and that every idea receives its emotional 
strength from the impression which produced it, it becomes evident 
that a suitable selection of sensations must definitely influence the 
emotional life of the child, which fact the educator must consider. 
And if empiric psychology teaches that actions are governed by the 
laws of association and are determined by the selection and combina- 
tion of present and former sensations, pedagogy must give special 
attention to the selection and combination of sensations in order to 
control the actions of the child in the widest range. 
These few examples show how significant present empiric psychol- 
ogy, upon a physiological basis, is for the educator. Of course there 
can be no question of a thorough transformation of pedagogy upon 
the ground of physiological psychology; as it has given to earlier 
empiric psychology a firm basis, and developed it, so there will be 
only a further development of pedagogy. As it is in psychology, as 
in fact, in every other science, there are and will forever be deficien- 
cies and unsolved problems, so, in the future, there will be unsolved 
problems in pedagogy, concerning which one must be content with 
mere experience. The efforts of educators in behalf of psychology 
should tend to create works which, with original work of investiga- 
tors as references, will treat minutely those psychologic subjects 
which are of vital importance to the practical work of training and 
teaching. Other points, of relatively less value, may be passed over 
with a mere mention. 
The highest aim of philosophy is always the acquirement of a view 
of the world (Weltanschauung) which meets the want of the human 
mind according to the subordination of unities under comprehensive, 
theoretical, and practical points of view, says Professor Hochegger, 
whose recent death was most untimely for the science in question. 
This view of the world must culminate in a knowledge of the order 
of the moral world and must lead to moral actions. Intellectual phi- 
losophy—logic—points out the way for correct cognition of the world; 
moral philosophy—ethics—points out the road for moralaction. The 
development of logic and ethics is influenced by the development of 
psychology upon the firm basis of natural science, for both are chil- 
dren of psychology. While logic deals with the individual, who is 
the first object of the educator’s study, ethics acquaints us with man- 
kind and the laws of ethical development to which mankind in general 
gives expression. The former defines the course of individual, the 
latter the course of social education. Lotze and Wundt pursued a 
new course in logic. Other investigators, as Sigwart, Schuppe, and 
Dorner, also hold prominent places in the development of these 
sciences. The scientific method, which begins with induction and 
then proceeds to deduction, has proven to be beneficial to psychology 
also. The advancement of logic was, in this respect, furthered by the 
development of the separate sciences, which had in the meantime 
made great strides forward. 
The methods for the natural sciences, arranged conformably to wide experience 
and the results of numerous efforts, can, by careful generalization (omitting what 
pertains to the individuality of the separate branches), define principles applicable 
to every kind of investigation, and which, if properly modified, can enrich and 
clarify all the distinct branches of science. By a comparison of the methods of 
investigation established in the different fields of science a clear mind must 
surely arrive at clear and surprising results and certain fundamental principles, 
which prove that discoveries made from too slender premises are partial errors
-P-A-G-E-213
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 133 
or unnecessary time-wasting byways. The principles and methods thus newly, 
found must, moreover, apply to practical life and the schools, and be improve- 
ments upon the methods in vogue. (Ehrat: The importance of logic to science, 
school, and life.) . 
Logic, therefore, aims at the development of a view by which the 
world of phenomena can be actually understood and the truth found. 
It endeavors to prove that by proper perception, consideration, and 
comparative observation, by an arrangement and adjustment under 
definitions (consequently by critical judgment and conclusion), and 
by convincing argument and reliable development of a scientific 
system (by means of continued and strict induction, deduction, and 
classification) science originates, and a proper view of the world can 
be gained and made perceptible. 
Such a logic will show how the growing human being must be 
directed so that the physical and psychical germs of possibilities of a 
later development within him may grow toward perfection, and that 
his whole earthly existence may present the realization of ethical and 
esthetic ideals. It therefore points out the course to be pursued by 
individual training and outlines the duties of social education, which, 
in its ultimate aims, is more definitely defined by ethics. It is the 
duty of the teacher, therefore, to see that upon the foundation of 
the original work of the expounders of this science, a logic be pre- 
pared in which all useless ballast from formal logic (i. e., table of 
categories, division of judgments, according to the quantity of sub- 
ject, the quality of predicate, syllogisms, modes, etc.), is omitted, and 
a scientific methodology (induction, deduction, ete.), be founded on 
the basis of the qualities and laws of human thought which have 
been made objects of perception by psychology. Upon the basis of 
such a logic alone can pedagogy establish the laws of intellectual 
edueation and found a pedagogical methodology. 
Paulsen, Dorner, and others are associated with Lotze and Wundt 
in the development of ethics. On the one hand, the effort has been 
made to define the connection between ethics and psychology, meta- 
physies, and religious philosophy; on the other hand, the independ- 
ence of moral laws and their relative independence of these sciences 
have been maintained; and they have been applied to human action 
in the different vocations of life. The laws are to be abstracted from 
the facts of moral life; hence the process of defining the laws is 
empiric. The moral laws already in existence and tested by moral 
acts must be defined and established, and applied to the action of 
man individually and collectively. The view of the world, derived 
from scientific logic, shows that in the entire world a great, uniform, 
uninterrupted, progressive movement takes place, to which all phe- 
nomena, even those of intellectual life, are subordinate; and that it 
is the duty of mankind to promote the fuller development of culture 
toward perfection, so that the order of the moral world may be more 
and more clearly manifested in civilization. 
Students in ethics must not forget that all moral views, as are all 
facts in intellectual action, are subject to a future development so 
immense that we have no measure for it. However, from its past 
development we may estimate its future. Ethics teaches how moral 
individualism—the striving of the individual after moral perfection, 
and thereby after happiness—can and must be united with moral 
socialism—that is to say, the striving of mankind toward moral per- 
fection. Ethics is therefore occupied with the ethical ennoblement 
of man, individually and socially. But as the formation of moral  
-P-A-G-E-214
    134 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. _ 
character—the ennoblement of man in development to a moral per- 
sonality in the service of society—is the end of education, so ethics 
defines the direction of education and its attainment. 
The purpose of education is to help man and mankind as a whole 
in developing toward perfection, formally and materially. The start- 
ing point, course, and end of formal perfection are made known to us 
by the science of man, particularly physiology and psychology. The 
means, ways, and ends of material perfection in physical, mental, and 
moral regard are defined by dietetics, logic, and ethics. Conse- 
quently, they have always been, and ever will be, the fundamental 
sciences upon which pedagogy, the science of education, rests. 
General pedagogy must follow the course defined by these funda- 
mental sciences, and show how, in accordance with the given laws for 
the development of intellectual lifa and moral culture, the end of 
education is to be attained in the shortest and best natural and 
scientific way, and with the simplest and best natural and scientifie 
means. For education in the pedagogical sense is the designed and 
regular influence of the educator on the development of the child, 
so that it may most surely attain its end on the shortest and best road, 
with the simplest and best means. Everything which does not meet 
these demands is excluded from the science of pedagogy. 
Pedagogy must be primarily occupied with the object of edueation, 
i. e., the child and its development. In order to recognize the lawful 
course of this development and to what end natural growth tends—for 
natural growth is ever unchangeable, unaffected by changes of time 
or culture—it must investigate how this end is more minutely defined 
by the eulture, science, and art of the times, for education must 
enable the child to elevate himself in the shortest and best way con- 
formable to natural development, from the low stage of mentality in 
which he is born to the highest state of culture that up to this time 
has been attained by mankind, and especially by his own nation, and 
to take a successful part in the development of human culture in the 
sense of moral perfection. 
Finally, general pedagogy must investigate the means and ways 
and frame applicable rules by means of which the child ean attain the 
preposed end according to the established laws of development. It 
must, consequently, determine the means and ways by which the pupil 
acquires a sensible and intelligent view of life and the world, and . 
becomes capacitated for intelligent action. It must find the ways and 
means by which the development of the individual is so directed that 
he understands his natural and historical surroundings and is enabled 
to assert himself in them. 
This is the general education which everyone must possess without 
regard to his vocation, and general pedagogy must keep this in view. 
This educational aim culminates in the ideal aim of a moral person- 
ality—a moral character. It is the same for all time. General peda- 
gogy of the present day need only see to it that the end and the ways 
hereto, in progressive science, particularly anthropology, logic, and 
ethics, be more clearly recognized, and that the natural and scientific 
means for the attainment of this end be chosen with regard to the 
progress of education and science. 
If the educational aims of the time do not conform to the rules 
established by general pedagogy, if they be not natural nor in touch 
with the culture prevailing, a change of educational aims is necessary, 
in the sense that the forming of reasonable views of the world and a 
moral view of life is aimed at, by means of which the child is enabled
-P-A-G-E-215
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 135 
to develop into a moral personality which can successfully take part 
in the further development of education in the growth toward moral 
perfection. From this standpoint the selection of educational means 
and aims separately, their mutual relation and their reciprocal action 
(concentration), as well as the methods, must be kept in view, in order, 
if necessary, to exact a transformation according to the demands of 
the conditions of education and life of the times. 
An education which meets these demands also prepares for practical 
life, for it enables the pupil to participate successfully in the educa- 
tional work of the present. It places him on a high stage of adapta- 
bility, so that under all vicissitudes of fortune he can assert his 
position in life and become a useful member of society. The particu- 
lar preparation for a distinet vocation with which special pedagogy 
is oceupied is easily associated with it. 
Special pedagogy shows how the rules laid down by general peda- 
gogy apply to particular cases, i. e., to certain school conditions and 
branches of study, and how they must accordingly be supplemented 
and expanded. While general pedagogy has a more theoretical 
character, special pedagogy is more practical, without losing the 
scientific character and becoming absolutely practical, since it is the 
consequent construction of general pedagogy with regard to special 
conditions. The development of general pedagogy, therefore, aids 
the development and construction of special pedagogy, which is always 
under the influence of the education of the time. 
Test all, keep the good, and if anything better has matured within 
you, add it to this good, is the task set before scientific pedagogy, in 
connection with the study of pedagogy in its development within the 
social culture and intellectual life of the times, and from the stand- 
point of science, art,and philosophy. It is to be critical in its view of 
the pedagogy of the past, and systematically constructive in reference 
to the pedagogy of the present. This forms the conclusion of the his- 
tory of educational development, and contains the directions to be 
followed by the pedagogy of the future. Many a stone toward the 
erection of this systematic pedagogy, i. e., for a theory of scientific 
pedagogy, has been laid. A systematic adjustment to a relatively 
finished system is still lacking. In separate divisions attempts have 
been made to mold different studies, especially those of natural phi- 
losophy, according to modern points of view; but on the whole the 
systematic pedagogy of our time is of the past. 
Every educational system grows historically from the general status 
of science and the views of the world and life of a people and its age, 
consequently there is no system of education generally applicable to 
all ages. Be the system religious or philosophical; be it the system 
of a Pestalozzi, Harnisch, or Diesterweg, of a Herbart or Beneke, of 
a Ziller or Dittes, it is never applicable to all nor to successive ages. 
Scientific pedagogy of our time, which should direct the course of 
education and culture for youth in the present and future, must be 
rooted in the culture of science and philosophy, in the views of life 
and the world of our time, and derive its rules from them; and it 
must preserve the good that has been acquired by critical tests of 
the systems of the past, exclude what no longer meets the present 
demands of science and the prevailing views, and add the better, 
which has been found by experience and reflection, under the influ- 
ence of the progress of social culture and intellectual life—add it in 
the spirit of truth and love. ;
-P-A-G-E-216
  136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
A different task is set before practical educators; they must caleu- 
late with the given factors and endeavor to turn existing conditions 
that have a historic foundation gradually into the courses of a 
natural and scientific development conformable with the demands of 
scientific pedagogy. They must, therefore, consider even such con- 
ditions and factors as are no longer justified by the demands of 
present scientific pedagogy, but which they have not the power to 
set aside. They must give directions which, presupposing the peda- 
gogical tact acquired by experience, reflection, and practice, can be 
directly applied. Because of their direct use to him, practical peda- 
gogy is the chief study for the teacher. But he can never lose the 
connection with scientific pedagogy without descending to the plane 
of a mechanic and jeopardizing the necessary and beneficial recip- 
rocal action between theory and practice in the development of 
pedagogy. 
From the points of view proposed let us examine more closely the 
most important pedagogical writings of the year 1895. 
I. Pedagogy as a whole, in its historical development.—Recent 
prominent articles in educational journals and the subjects discussed 
in 1896 by the National German Teachers’ Association (for instance, 
“The transformation of educational aims according to present de- 
mands”), show plainly wherein scientific pedagogy is deficient, i. e., 
in knowledge of the history of educational development from ancient 
times to the present in its connection with social culture and intel- 
lectual life. If such a literary treasure had been available to ele- 
mentary school-teachers and its contents had been thoroughly studied 
by them, they would surely have known that the paramount question 
should not be put in the form in which it is presented. There can be 
no question of a ‘‘transformation of educational aims.” To effect 
such a change we must be familiar with the development of education 
in close connection with the social culture and intellectual life of the 
times and know what relation educational aims, as they are defined in 
our present school system, bear to the civilization of the times in which 
they were proposed, and whether they still meet the demands of pres- 
ent culture. If this can not be affirmed, we must investigate further 
and see what claims are made by the present social culture and intel- 
lJectual life and how the educational aims of elementary schools must 
be changed so that they may meet present demands. As these con- 
ditions have not been fulfilled, none of the discussions on this subject 
have had any satisfactory result. In consequence, the executive com- 
mittee of the National Teachers’ Association has changed the wording of 
the theme, restricting the general question to particulars: ‘‘ What 
studies are to be introduced into the curriculum of present elementary 
schools?” The difficulties inthe way of a general answer to this ques- 
tion have thus been only apparently removed, and a treatment of the 
subject, based upon principles and from the standpoint of scientific 
pedagogy, has been renounced. There is no other course left now 
than to answer the question from the standpoint of practical life and 
the experience of individual teachers. That the answer given will 
not be the right one, because the firm points of view based on prin- 
ciples are wanting, needs no further argument. The question will be 
differently answered according to the understanding of the demands 
of practical life and experience of the individual. 
The first question which confronts the educator is the aim of his occupation. 
To be able to answer this, and answer it in such way as to oppose all contradic- 
tion, it does not suffice to rely upon daily experience, or the opinions either of
-P-A-G-E-217
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 137 
  those by whom we are surrounded or a larger public. Counsel must be sought 
elsewhere, namely, in science. First in order is the history of education. The 
study of it is of greatest importance, in fact, indispensable. It must form the 
foundation and the starting point of all the theoretical schooling of the artist- 
educator. (Dr. Bergemann, The Foundations of Truly Scientific Pedagogy.) 
Anthropologic-ethieal pedagogy of itself, that is, without connec- 
tion with the social culture and intellectual life of the times, proposes 
a purely formal aim to education (moral personality, ete.). The more 
immediate purpose which directs general educational aims in their 
separate parts, and thus defines that which leads to the attainment of 
the end mentioned in the foregoing discussion (moral, intellectual, 
physical, and economical education), pedagogy derives from the social 
culture and intellectual life of the times. From this standpoint, then, 
the means that serve for the attainment of this end, consequently, the 
studies of the lower schools, must be selected. 
Whoever watches attentively the currents of social culture and the 
intellect of our times, understands that we are living in an age of 
great agitation, similar to the transition period from the Middle Ages 
to modern times, in which scholasticism struggled with free science 
and its outcome, free philosophy. We are undoubtedly approaching 
a new era of social culture and civilization, for which the foundations 
have been laid since the middle of this century, and of the develop- 
ment of which the century to come must take care. New civilization, 
upon the foundation of modern science, however, requires a new ped- 
agogy; new not in the sense that any thing old or rooted in the past 
must be cast aside and a totally new construction framed, but new in 
the sense that what has stood the test and still meets pr esent demands 
of social culture and intellectual life, themselves outgrowths of the 
past, be preserved and supplemented, expanded and intensified con- 
formably to educational and intellectual progress. In substance, 
scientific and practical pedagogy of our times rests upon the past. 
Occasionally we notice a few innovations, often without any well- 
founded relation to the whole, which attempt to justify the claims of 
present life. In last year’s report (Richter’s Padagogischer Jahres- 
bericht, 1894) we discussed different attempts to frame a new structure 
according to the demands of the social culture and intellectual life of 
our times. As we then demonstrated, biased views were followed, 
isolated as they were from the development of pedagogy, and, there- 
fore, not founded on the firm substructure of a history of educational 
growth. This must first be established before we can set the capstone 
inthe erection of a new structure. 
We exact nothing new in this respect. Karl Schmidt has, in four 
comprehensive volumes, already given us a ‘‘ History of Pedagogy, 
treated in historical development and in organic connection with the 
intellectual life of nations.” Independent of the mistakes and defi- 
ciencies that must attach to so comprehensive a work, which treats of 
the development of all educational efforts in their arrangement and 
various applications, uniformly and from every point of view, there is 
the further fault that in 1890 only the first volume appeared, revised 
with the aid of later investigations and discoveries. It is, however, 
the last of the four volumes, treating of the present time, from Pesta- 
lozzi to Dittes, which must be thoroughly revised to meet the present 
requirements of a history of education. The first volume of the work 
in its new edition, owing to its extensive plan, has attained such a 
dimension that it has found few purchasers among teachers. That 
may be the reason why the revision of the following volumes has not  
-P-A-G-E-218
  138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  yet been undertaken, and is not anticipated. The development of 
pedagogy before Pestalozzi is not so important to the teacher, for, in 
fact, actual pedagogy for elementary public schools exists only since 
Pestalozzi, since a knowledge of the science and art is not altogether 
indispensable, as the pedagogy of Pestalozzi is rooted in the time before 
Pestalozzi. A history of pedagogical development for teachers must 
eomprehensively treat of the times before Pestalozzi, and lay special 
stress upon the facts which are important and valuable for the public- 
schooleducation. (Karl Schmidt devotes three large volumes to these. ) 
The time since Pestalozzi requires a thorough treatment, so that the 
teacher may obtain a clear insight into the pedagogy for elementary 
public schools, and can distinetly recognize the claims of the present 
on the educational aims of schools designed for the masses. 
The writer has for years labored at such a work (Guide to the 
Further Education of Teachers), and its outlines have been finished. 
These outlines, like other similar books, may suffice for those teachers 
who confine themselves to the first and most important occupation of 
their profession, teaching and training, and take only a limited part 
in pedagogical advancement. For all other public-school teachers, 
and particularly for teachers in normal schools, a cursory presenta- 
tion of the subject does not suffice, especially if they wish to partici- 
pate actively in the development of scientific and practical pedagogy 
for publie schools. In ‘‘The pedagogy of Pestalozzi in its develop- 
ment, construction, and completion, and according to its influence 
upon the formation of school systems,” the writer has endeavored 
to give a comprehensive treatise on the period of the birth of peda- 
gogy for common schools, according to the quoted points of view. 
He intends to present in the same way in a volume of the same com- 
pass the development before, and in two more volumes the develop- 
ment after Pestalozzi, so that the last volume will be a treatise on the 
eurrents of pedagogy and its fundamental and auxiliary sciences in 
connection with the civilization of our times. 
The past year (1895) was not wanting in contributions and original 
references for such a work, both as regards the fundamental sciences 
and actual pedagogy. The more and the more thoroughly we inves- 
tigate and labor in this respect, namely, the more old school records 
and other official documents are utilized in the preparation of articles 
on the development of school systems of separate cities and States, the 
more reliable will be the presentation of the whole in which the essen- 
tial facts are united. Most of the smaller works on the history of 
education are conglomerations of all kinds of facts, some worth 
knowing, others worthless, but not a single work on history of educa- 
tional development in the sense in which we are to apply the term. 
Still, they meet the requirements of the customary instruction in 
normal schools of to-day; and for purposes of fitting students for 
professional examinations they do well enough. 
Il. The fundamental sciences of pedagogy have been essentially 
enriched during the past year. We note valuable new works on the 
history of philosophy and on the results of late investigations in psy- 
chology and logic, and authoritative works on ethics. Greater efforts 
are constantly being made to render the results of scientific investiga- 
tion accessible to the unlearned in a form that is easily understood. 
The authors are careful to separate the positive facts from mere 
hypotheses and theories not yet sufficiently tried. The examination 
of problems in psychology and ethics is discussed, and their solution 
attempted from present standpoints of these sciences. The efforts
-P-A-G-E-219
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 139 
in both directions are beneficial for pedagogy. On the one hand, 
teachers are enabled to acquaint themselves with the results of scien- 
tific investigation without the difficult and absorbing study of more 
eomprehensive works; and, on the other hand, they ean occupy them- 
selves with purely pedagogic questions, such as attention, distraction, 
and others of great importance to educational practice. Since Pesta- 
lozzi, all leading teachers have emphasized the fact that a successful 
education is possible only with a correct knowledge of man in his 
physical and intellectual character. Of course, we can not rest with 
this knowledge alone. The child must be studied from the acquired 
points of view, and the established psychological laws applied to the 
solution of special educational tasks. Even if we have no books 
which treat of psychology, logie, and ethics in the form above defined 
with respect to pedagogy, according to the present status of these sci- 
ences, the way has been opened for the publication of such works in 
the course of time. é 
Hil. . General pedagogy has been enriched this year by several valua- 
ble monographs (on interest, concentration), but there are no compre- 
hensive treatises on the basis of later psychology, logic, and ethies. 
Reforms, deserving of increased attention, are being prepared in gen- 
eral didacties, as we learn from several pamphlets at hand. The 
impulse has been given by ethics on the one hand and by special sei- 
ences on the other, and has already exerted a strong influence on the 
different branches of study of special methodology. 
IV. In special pedagogy we can only note monographs, few of 
which, however, deserve to be classed among the literature of special 
pedagogy. They refer mostly to subjects of methodology. They treat 
mainly of the valuation of matters submitted by special sciences for 
moral and economic training (in lessons on religion, in natural study, 
and other branches). In all branches of instruction there are noticed 
strenuous efforts to establish the causal connection between the vari- 
ous departments of science, to place things and phenomena according 
to the natural connection in which they actually exist, and to sift and 
supplement the subject-matter conformably to the results of the 
scientific investigation of the times and its value for religiously moral, 
intellectual, and economic education. 
If we compare with open eyes the demands of the times and of sci- 
ence with those of scientific and practical pedagogy, we are convinced 
that scientific pedagogy must consider more than heretofore the 
demands of the times and of science, and that special pedagogy must 
pay greater attention to the demands of general pedagogy. The 
teachers of public schools must fully understand this fact. Beyond 
question the public schools of to-day give better results than those of 
fifty years ago, but their progress has not kept pace with the immense 
changes in public life and the necessities occasioned thereby. The 
selection, arrangement, and treatment of studies must be repeatedly 
subjected to a minute investigation from the standpoint of natural 
and scientific pedagogy. Should the result be a transformation of 
official—i. e., practically applied-—-pedagogy in respect to well-defined 
educational aims, scientific pedagogy must endeavor to have these 
demands recognized and met with in practice. This is entirely in 
accordance with both nature and culture, for progress everywhere 
means the normal condition—health.. A standing stillis an abnormal 
condition—disease; and diseases in social bodies lead to revolutions. 
A harmonious development of man in body and soul into a noble 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  human character, in whom the sensual is subordinate to the intel- 
lectual and the intellectual to the moral, is to-day, as it was in Pesta- 
lozzi’s time, the highest formal aim of the education of the individual. 
But the claims of social pedagogy—i. e., to understand the individual 
as a member of his race, and particularly as a member of his nation, 
and develop him into a moral personality, capable of successfully 
taking part in the educational work of his time in the sense of educa- 
tional progress—are more prominent than ever. In this sense our 
times demand an increase in valuable matters of formal education of 
the individual, in view of the fact that every member of the State 
should attain the highest possible grade of physical, mental, and 
moral development, so that under all vicissitudes he can assert an 
independent position in life, understand his existence in a world of 
reality, be a useful member of society as a strong, moral individual, 
and firm, independent personality, and can intelligently take part in 
social progress toward perfection. 
Above all things, then, our times require a harmonious, natural, and 
scientific perfecting of physical, mental, moral, and economic devel- 
opment of the individual, especially in his mutual relations with 
others. They require the body to be strengthened, the intellect 
trained, and the will disciplined. It is therefore necessary to give 
closer attention to the care of juvenile and national games, to manual 
training, and to reforms in nature study, historical and ethical instruc- 
tion, and to the introduction of the studies of civies and national and 
domestic economy. All these branches must be examined, and the 
dividing line sharply drawn between what belongs to the general edu- 
eation of every pupil in the common schools and what toa special 
education, and confined to supplementary schools. A thorough sift- 
ing of matter in regard to these studies must take place, so that all 
matter foreign to moral, social, and economic education may be 
rejected. Close attention must be given to removing all useless bal- 
Jast from the curriculum of the schools, and to making the studies 
correspond to the present demands of science and the view of the 
world and life founded on it. In the acquiring of a harmonious and 
reasonable view of the world and life lies moral self-dependence for 
the individual or the nation, which guarantees the development of - 
mankind in the sense of moral perfection. This self-dependence 
results from a clear understanding of natural and civilized life, and 
from an emotional and intelligent comprehension of moral and reli- 
gious truths and their connection with the natural laws of life. Suc- 
cessful participation in the social life of communities and the State 
requires a clear knowledge of the history of the development, the con- 
ditions of existence, and the construction of these social organisms, as 
well as the ability to recognize and respect the rights and duties owing 
to them. The individual must therefore learn the history, the con- 
ditions of life, and the constitution of his nation and his State, must 
convince himself that he can only find his construction of life and 
earthly destiny in the social whole, and must arrive at an earnest 
determination to participate successfully in the civilizing work of his 
time and his nation. 
Finally, the individual can only participate in the economic work 
of the civilization of his times if he penetrates the laws of nature in 
so far as they affect his sphere of action, and reviews the economic 
organic connection of personal work with the general civilizing work 
of his nation. He can take an active part only if he can master and 
apply these laws, and is willing to enter their service. However, a
-P-A-G-E-221

  proper arrangement of the curriculum must establish such uniformity 
among the separate studies that they give reciprocal support, and 
make possible the formation of a uniform sphere of thought, the 
separate parts of which are most intimately joined. 
Of course, the treatment of the studies must follow the laws of 
pedagogic methods, which receive their direction from psychology and 
logic. Discipline, in obedience to ethical laws, must support the 
education of the intellect and assist in bringing the formation of 
ethical character nearer to perfection. It must associate with the 
view of the world and of life, acquired by means of the education of 
the intellect, and mold the energy produced by ethical ideas based on 
this foundation into a fixed purpose of the will which no obstacle can 
turn aside from making these ideas rule in any one life or in the social 
organism of a nation. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS OR SEPARATE CLASSES FOR CHILDREN OF LIMITED 
MENTAL CAPACITY. 
In November, 1892, the minister of public education in Berlin 
published an order referring to the fact that in several cities of the 
Kingdom of Prussia the local school authorities had arranged for 
separating from the majority of pupils children intellectually slow 
_and dull, but otherwise normal, and by no means to be confounded 
with idiots, by establishing either special schools for them or sepa- 
arate classes in large schoolhouses. He particularly emphasized the 
consideration that the pupils to be selected for this special instruc- 
tion should not be idiots—that is, children entirely helpless and only 
_ fit to be placed in asylums—for such individuals had no place ina 
public school; but he intimated that children should be selected who 
are a ‘“‘dead weight” in school, and fail to be promoted because they 
can not keep pace with average pupils. Such children might be 
benefited by methods specially adapted to their weakness, and the 
course of study might be altered and curtailed to suit their capacity. 
He furthermore insisted that every pupil assigned to these special 
schools or separate classes must be subjected to a careful physical 
examination by a physician to determine whether their intellectual 
weakness be not the result of defective senses, or other causes that 
_ may be removed. He closed his order by calling for a report of every 
school inspector in whose district such an establishment exists. 
The result of this inquiry in March, 1893, was published in tabu- 
lated form in June, 1894. The minister prefaced this brief table by 
saying that such institutions were in existence in eighteen cities of 
the Kingdom. While in previous years the special classes had been 
partly filled with children morally unsafe, these had lately been with- 
drawn, and now only children of dull intellect were thus treated 
separately. These were pupils who, during an attendance of two or 
three years in graded schools, had given evidence that they could be 
taught, but were unable to keep pace with normally endowed children.
-P-A-G-E-222
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Experience, he stated, had proved that such children could be found 
everywhere, and that both the poorly and the normally endowed were 
benefited by a separation. The authorities of several cities reported 
that these intellectually weak children were normal enough to educate 
to be useful members of society, if their training were carefully 
adapted to their needs. The minister repeated his injunetion, that 
no child be assigned to such a school, or special class, unless a physi- 
cian had given his consent, and stated that the retarded intellect was 
eaused by constitutional defects, or was an after effect of disease, and 
hence could not be accelerated by the usual school influences, but 
needed special treatment. The minister expressed his approval of 
the efforts of teachers in behalf of child-study, especially in gathering 
data concerning the history of mental development in weak-minded 
children. The consent of the physician, he remarked, was most desir- 
able, inasmuch as such authoritative action would be a safeguard 
against assigning to these separate classes any children who are nor- 
mally or excessively endowed by nature. 
The opinions called for had proved unaminously favorable, and in 
many cities both school and city authorities followed the enterprise 
with sympathy and deep interest. In consequenee of the decided 
suecess of the older institutions of this kind, other local authorities 
had been induced to grant the required appropriations, so that the 
number of pupils could be restricted to 25 in any one of these sepa- 
rate classes or schools. He gathered from the reports sent him that 
specially talented and skillful teachers had been employed, and that 
their salaries ranged considerably higher than the average. The 
name given to these separate classes in Prussia is ‘‘ Hilfsklassen fiir 
schwachbegabte Kinder” (supplementary elasses for weakly endowed 
children). 
In these special classes no lesson or exercise is allowed to exceed 
thirty minutes, and the amount to be learned in a year’s course is not 
as greatas in ordinary schools. The result, the minister thinks, might 
be considered quite satisfactory if the children, when ready to be dis- 
missed at 14 years of age, have reached the degree of proficiency 
usually attained by children of 11 or 12 years. A number of carefully 
itemized courses of study submitted to the minister (but not pub- 
lished) are approved. as exhibiting a laudable consideration of the 
particular aims of such institutions, with regard to both the amount 
and the selection of matter to bo taught. Subjects, for instance, 
which require exceptional mental effort are set aside in favor of others 
better adapted to develop physical energy and practical skill. Out- 
side of Berlin all the separate classes for intellectually dull children 
are maintained by municipal government, while in Berlin such chil- 
dren are placed under private eare.

  On the 28th of August, 1896, the minister of education published a 
second report, which revealed the facts that from the 18 cities which 
im 1894 had provided for separate classes for dull children there had 
been an increase to 27, and in the number of pupils from 700 to 
2,017. He expresses his satisfaction that the unexpected success of 
these institutions has resulted in removing obstacles arising from the 
opposition of parents against a separation of their children from the 
majority. He assures the local authorities that he will continue to 
watch with sympathy their efforts in behalf of these separate schools 
or classes, and will aid them as far as possible. The following is the 
result of the last statistical inquiry, dated January 13, 1896.

   146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
   
Remarks.—Kénigsberg reports that the pupils of 14 years, who are 
dismissed from the special classes, have all been able to earn a living. 
Charlottenburg and other cities report that nearly one-half of the 
time devoted to the mentally slow pupils is spent in giving manual 
training. Occasional reports state that about 40 per cent of these 
dull children are girls, and that in every case where a sufficient num- 
ber of girls are found they are taught by a woman, chiefly in woman’s 
handiwork. Many of the pupils are found to have defective senses, 
either of sight or hearing, and that when the defects are cured, they 
are allable to take up the work of the regular school and are sent there. 
There are occasional cases of children who prove entirely unable 
to learn arithmetic, reading, or writing. These are chiefly taught 
manual dexterity. In some cities, notably in Dortmund, Westphalia, 
the percentage of mentally slow pupils, fit only for separate classes, 
has been found to be two to three in a thousand. Naturally they are 
found in centers of population oftener than in the country. 
In connection with the foregoing governmental report it is instruc- 
tive to present a feature of the schools of Berlin which sheds light on 
the necessity of caring for children who do not quite come up to the 
average in intellectual attainments. The report of the Berlin school 
board of 1895 contains these statements: 4 
Of all the pupils in the first or primer classes in the city there were 
4 boys and 1 girl aged 14 years, 2 boys and 5 girls aged 13, 12 boys 
and 10 girls aged 12, 37 boys and 31 girls aged 11, 95 boys and 89 girls 
aged 10, 428 boys and 320 girls aged 9, who shouldbe treated like 
those considered as being but 6 years old, or at most 7. 
Of all the pupils in the second grade in the city there were 11 boys 
and 1 girl aged 14 years, 50 boys and 44 girls aged 13, 135 boys and 150 
girls aged 12, 421 boys and 370 girls aged 11, 1,040 boys and 1,048 girls 
aged 10, who should be treated like those considered as being but 7, 
or at most 8 years old. 
Of all the pupils in the third grade in the city there were 3 boys 
and 1 girl over 14 years, 56 boys and 48 girls aged 14, 889 boys and 438 
girls aged 13, 896 boys and 1,006 girls aged 12, 1,804 boys and 2,031 
girls aged 11, whose average age should be considered as being but 
9 or 10 years. 
Of all the pupils in the fourth grade in the city there were 2 boys 
over 14 years, 214 boys and 236 girls aged 14 years, 1,392 boys and 
1,457 girls aged 13, 2,346 boys and 2,710 girls aged 12, while the aver- 
age age of normally endowed children of this grade is between 10 and 
11 years. 
Of course the figures are to some extent explained by the enormous 
influx of population during the last twenty years, a period during 
which Berlin grew faster even than Chicago. They are also explained 
by the rapid shifting of the population which followed the demands 
of the labor market and the ever-shifting conditions in industry.

  But it is reasonable to suppose that among the great number of pupils 
reported as above the average age there are many who might be ben- 
efited by special care in separate classes. 
SEPARATE SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The idea of establishing separate classes or schools for pupils of 
limited natural endowment was first presented to American teachers 
by Prof. August Schneck, of Detroit, in a paper read before the 
German-American Teachers’ Association in 1878. It was taken up 
by Dr. Andrew J. Rickoff, superintendent of schools in Cleveland, 
Ohio. He established two such schools, but chiefly for morally 
unsound children—that is, boys and girls who had proved unsafe 
companions for others. Superintendent Frank Hall, of Waukegan, 
Ill., reeently followed this example and established such a school in 
his town.! It is not to be, in any sense, a limbo for the reception of 
mental and moral cripples, but will have careful plans of work, and 
will be just as ‘‘respectable” as any other school, as will be seen from 
the following announcement of Mr. Hall: 
Into this room pupils will be admitted from the following classes: 
1. Those who have not been in school for several years, and who now desire to 
avail themselves of school privileges, but do not seem to class well in any of the 
regular departments. 
2. Those who have completed the eighth-grade work, and for good and sufficient 
reasons do not desire to take the regular work of the high school, but who are 
anxious to become more proficient in the so-called common school branches. 
8. All pupils over 14 years of age and less than 21, whose education, in the judg- 
ment of the superintendent, can be better provided for in this department than in 
any other department of the school. 
The practical side of school work will receive especial emphasis. The arithme- 
tic of the farm, of the workshop, and of the store will be made prominent. We 
can not, with our limited facilities, compete with the commercial schools, but 
elementary bookkeeping will be taught, and the pupils will have frequent exercise 
in writing letters, receipts, duebills, notes, etc. 
In a small way we hope to introduce work in manual training—enough of this, 
at least, to assist the pupil in relating his school work to any legitimate manual 
occupation in which he may expect to engage. ‘That form of mind training 
called manual training” is desirable for all, but it is absolutely essential as a 
means of creating and maintaining interest on the part of those pupils who do not 
expect to become merchants or to engage in the learned professions. While we 
shall emphasize the so-called practical studies in this department, we shall, in 
addition to this, spare no pains to interest the pupils in good reading; to create a 
love for good books; to train them in thinking and in the expression of thought, 
and, in a word, to open to them some of the avenues that lead to higher intellec- 
tual culture and to the pleasures of the spirit. In all this we shall not lose sight 
of the fact that the aim of education is good character, and that good character 
implies useful occupation. 
Much that we shall attempt is, in some respects, experimental and tentative. 
All we can ask of any who may doubt the expediency of such a movement is that 
  
1Previous to this service at Waukegan, Mr. Hall was principal of the State 
Institution for the Blind, a position which he has resumed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. ~ 
they grant us the boon of what some one has called the greatest ‘discovery of the 
nineteenth century—suspended judgment. 
Though Mr. Hall will evidently pay particular attention to pupils 
of retarded development, he is benefiting his town by the establish- 
ment of aschoolresembling the German continuation or supplementary 
schools.! 
A valuable contribution to the discussion on separate schools for 
intellectually weak children is found in the proceedings of Philadel- 
phia Educational Club during its session on the 11th of January, 1897. 
The report of this session is contained in The Teacher, published in 
Philadelphia. Permission to reprint the article has been secured from 
the editor. As has been said before, American teachers do not restrict 
themselves to advocating separate schools for mentally weak children; 
they advocate also the admission of the morally unsound to these 
schools. This will be seen from the following discussion of the 
teachers in Philadelphia: 
The subject of the evening was ‘‘Special schools for individual children,” and 
the first speaker was Mrs. Rhoda A. Esten, of Providence, R. I., who said in part: 
The purpose of the special schools of Providence is to provide suitable instruc- 
tion and discipline for pupils for whom our present graded system of schools is 
not well adapted. The immediate occasion for the establishment of these schools 
was the abolition of corporal punishment in some grades and its very great restric- 
tion in others, combined with a strict enforcement of the ‘“‘truant law.” The 
change in the mode of enforcing discipline in our regular schools caused the 
teachers great trouble at first. Discipline became more difficult and some means 
of restraining those who seemed not to be amenable to reason were needed. At 
first the remedy against insubordination was suspension and sending home to 
parents. We found, as others have found, that the frequent and wholesale send- 
ing pupils home for misconduct brings the school into disrepute and the teacher 
intocontempt. The parent becomes exasperated and denounces the teacher in the 
presence of the child or punishes the child with too great severity. The strict 
enforcement of the truant law compelled the pupils, turned loose upon the street, 
to return to school, thus causing the attendance of a class of children who never 
relish the confinement of the school—the truants and children of the street. 
Provision for chronic truants.—The committee recognized that some provision 
must be made for these pupils, and met the issue by establishing special schools 
whose work in part was to provide for this class. Six of these schools were estab- 
lished during the school year 1893-94 and one in October, 1894. The schools were 
organized as annexes of our grammar schools, but were opened in detached build- 
ings. Five occupy evening schoolrooms, onea ward room, one a hired chapel, one 
an unused room ina primary school building. Of the pupils provided for in these 
schools, perhaps the most deserving are those who, by reason of poverty or lack 
of means, can attend school only eighty days of the year, and, in consequence of 
this loss of time in school, fail to keep up with their grade work. 
The boy who gets behind his fellows and has grown old in years and become 
maturer in powers, but deficient in his acquisitions, can not be well provided 
for in our graded schools. He enters school after a year’s absence, perhaps, and 
is classed with pupils younger and smaller than himself. This is galling to his 
pride. If he be a boy of good ability, to whom opportunity has been lacking, he

title, ‘‘Education in Central Europe.”

  can do much more than his classmates, but has no opportunity to go faster. If 
he be dull, staying at home has not increased his power of acquisition, though 
some development has come with years. In a manufacturing city like Providence 
the number of pupils of this class is large. 
Our superintendent and committee recognized the needs of this class early in 
the school year 1887-88 and urged the necessity of establishing ungraded schools 
with a course of study adapted to meet the needs of this class, who can only go to 
school for a few years. The committee concurred with the superintendent, but 
the council failed toact, These pupils are now provided for by our special schools. 
Other classes of children benefited.—There are other pupils who, from absence 
and lack of self-control, fail to do well and become a disturbing element in the 
regular schools, requiring so much of the teacher’s time to manage as to prevent 
her from doing justice to the large number of regular, obedient, and studious chil- 
dren under her charge. In these schools, under teachers strong in self-control, 
patient and tactful in management, these pupils are brought to a state of obedi- 
ence and self-respect. Pupils who for some cause are disaffected and out of 
harmony with their surroundings are much benefited by a short sojourn in these 
schools. Intelligent foreigners, who desire to obtain a knowledge of the English 
language and are too old to enter the grade in which their present acquisitions 
would place them, also become pupils in these schools. Perhaps the most difficult 
and least meritorious, and yet most needful of the pupils provided for in these 
schools, are the children forced into school—the unfortunate neglected ones who, 
from lack of sympathy or control at home, have become indifferent, unruly, and 
unwilling to attend school. With no disposition to work, it is impossible for these 
to take up the regular work of our graded schools, yet these pupils are compelled by 
law to attend school. These schools give to these pupils an opportunity to become 
educated, respectable citizens. There is no class of pupils that it will pay any 
State or city better to discipline and educate than this. In many instances these 
pupils have become industrious, ambitious, orderly, and respectful. 
The selection of teachers.—Great care, wisdom, and judgment were exercised on 
the part of the superintendent in the selection of teachers for theseschools. Strong- 
willed, self-reliant, self-possessed, cultured, kind, and sympathetic women are 
essential. Such teachers were selected from among the best in our schools. They 
rank as eighth grade teachers and receive a salary of $675 per annum. It ought 
to be $1,000 per annum. * 
The number of pupils to a teacher in these schools is limited to twenty or 
twenty-five, although better work is done withtwenty. Pupils sent for discipline 
are required to remain in these schools until, in the judgment of the teacher, they 
have acquired sufficient self-control and respect for lawful authority to enable them 
to enter the regular schools with a fair prospect of remaining. Some of these pupils 
are so peculiar in their dispositions that it is probable they may never go back to 
the regular schools. 
Discipline corrective, not punitive.—As the aim of these schools is mainly the 
character building, the discipline is corrective, not punitive. Great. pains are 
taken by the teachers to implant in the minds of these pupils a just conception of 
their duties to themselves and to those around them and a respect for lawful 
authority, thus including in the school training the training of the home in a 
marked degree. The teachers of these special schools receive these pupils kindly 
and show a personal interest in learning their attainments and preferences, and in 
pointing out to them what they cando. The past isignored and a new start taken. 
Teachers are allowed to use corporal punishment if they deem it useful in any case. 
They are not to endure disrespect and impertinence tamely in order to make a repu- 
tation for managing bad boys without punishment. At the same time, they are to 
avoid it if it arouses antagonism, and by all means, so far as possible, to have no 
altercation with a pupil in the presence of others.  
-P-A-G-E-230
150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  Selection of the pwpils.—Pupils who fail in respect for and obedience to the rules 
of schools and can not be brought to a proper state of control through the means 
at the command of the teacher are referred first to their parents, who are requested 
to call and cooperate with the teacher. This throws the responsibility on the 
parents, and gives them the opportunity to make the pupil obedient. Should the 
parent fail to appear within twenty-four hours, or appearing, and through lack 
of power or ability fail to bring the pupil to a proper state of obedience, the latter 
isthen sent to the office of the superintendent. Here he is dealt with in a firm, 
kind manner. If the pupil responds to his admonitions and expresses the desire 
to have another trial, unless the offense is a very grave one, he is given the oppor- 
tunity to return to his school again on trial. If he is again sent to the office, a 
transfer to the special schools is at once given. 
These schools are under the immediate charge of the ‘‘ supervisor of discipline,” 
who is expected to spend at least one hour a week in each school studying the 
pupils, noting the interest which they manifest in their work, and their progress— 
mainly, in two essentials, habit and disposition. These teachers meet weekly with 
the supervisor and discuss the best means of governing and disciplining their 
pupils, and of inculcating in them right motives of action, correct habits; also 
proper respect for lawful authority. These discussions are held at the round 
table for child study. 
Our superintendent, who was mainly instrumental in establishing these schools, 
and to whose reports I am indebted for many of the facts here presented, gives 
much thought and time to them, making valuable suggestions to both supervisor 
and teachers. The schools are also visited once a week by the “truant officer,” 
who inquires into the cases of absence and truancy. He has rendered valuable 
service to the supervisor in looking up these boys in their homes and impressing 
the parents with the majesty of law and cooperating fully with the teachers. Two 
records of each pupil are kept at the office of the superintendent of schools—first, 
his record in the school from which he came; and second, his record in the special 
school. Each child as he enters these schools is made an object of study by the 
teacher. His physical, mental, and moral defects are noted, and a written record 
is made of the same. Care is taken to note the effect of certain methods of dis- 
cipline and punishment. 
Effect of the special schools.—Our special schools help us to make good schools 
therule. They bring relief to the regular schools by freeing them from disturb- 
ing influences and relieving the regular teacher from the severer strain of disci- 
pline. Thus she is enabled to devote herself the more fully to the needs of the 
ordinary and more responsive pupils. By their aid we have successfully reclaimed 
and properly instructed and disciplined many persistently unruly pupils who could 
not be retained in our ordinary graded schools, with whom the only alternative 
was suspension, thus throwing upon the street the very class most needing instruc- 
tion and discipline. These schools are now placed upon a firm basis, and are a 
potent auxiliary in our school system. c 
The following statistics will show something of the work of these schools since 
their organization: 
From the organization of these schools to June 30, 1895, was a period varying 
in the several schools from nearly two years to a year and three months. During 
this period 372 different pupils were enrolled, and of these only 5 were sent to the 
Reform School and but 1 expelled. 
At the beginning of the school year 1895-96, 92 pupils remained in the disciplin- 
ary schools from the previous year. To these, 231 were added, making 323 cases 
treated; 16, however, were sent to these schools for reasons other than miscon- 
duct. Of these 823 pupils, 120 were returned to the regular schools, where 100 
maintained themselves in good standing, and 20, having failed to be satisfactory
-P-A-G-E-231

to the teachers, were returned to the disciplinary schools. Sixty-four left to go 
to work, 5 went to private and parochial schools, 11 moved from the city, 2 died, 
10 were sent to the Reform School, and 30 were reported at home—7 on account 
of sickness; 23 having attended the required eighty days were assisting their 
parents. One hundred and one remained members of the special schools at the 
beginning of the present year. 
The table that follows shows the grade of the pupils in these schools for the 
school year 1895-96:

As will be noticed, these pupils were of all grades but one below the high school, 
but the greater number were of the middle grades, those of the third to the seventh 
years. One grade, the 6 B, stands out conspicuous from its number. These were 
the boys just entering the grammar schools and coming into new combinations of 
pupils and under the control of men. In any community where there are pupils 
to be instructed in sufficient numbers to permit it they will be classified, and, 
should the number be large enough to furnish several classes of corresponding 
advancement, they will be graded. Grading produces both economy and effi- 
ciency in instruction. Theoretically, all pupils of a grade are able to do the same 
work and advance at the same speed; but practically it will be true that great 
differences of power will be found to exist—differences in mental acuteness, in 
mental grasp, in industry, ambition, health, steadiness of attendance, home advan- 
tages, environment, and other elements affecting progress. So, however well we 
may grade our pupils, their native differences will cause the distance between the 
better and the poorer scholars to increase every week. It would be a sin to try to 
keep a class together for a long time, because it could be done only by straining 
the weaker and suppressing the stronger. Practically, those below the average 
set the pace to which all others must conform, 
Special classes for bright pupils.—Again, some pupils do well in all subjects but 
one—usually arithmetic or grammar. To require such a pupil to review the sey- 
eral studies in which he does well for the sake of one or two in which he does 
poorly is not permitting him to use his time to the greatest profit; but this is 
nearly a necessity in a graded system. To remedy these difficulties, rooms for 
individual instruction have been opened in our large grammar schools in which 
the ambitious and capable pupils who wish to gain a grade are permitted to 
receive individual instruction, and by the aid of the special teachers accomplish 
the essential portions of work between the two grades and are promoted to the 
regular class in a higher grade, while those who have failed in one or two studies 
have the opportunity of entering, if sufficiently earnest, and devote special effort 
and extra time to the subject in which the deficiency appeared and so regain lost 
standing. 
The mentally deficient children.—Our latest idea is a special school for a class of 
pupils that appeal to our sympathies but injure our schools more than they gain 
good to themselves. These are the mentally deficient children, childrén of such 
low powers and aptitude that they gain very little from the ordinary graded 
i ge see

school. They require instruction in small groups, and need to be under the con- 
stant oversight of ateacher specially adapted for this work. This school was opened 
November 30, 1896, and has at present 12 girlsand boys, selected from our primary 
grades, whose ages range from 9 to 15 years. It is hoped by this arrangement to 
sift out in time the entire class of abnormal children from our regular schools, 
and by special instruction prepare the more hopeful cases to return to the regular 
school, 
To sum up, the essentials for the success of these schools are: 
(1) A limited number of pupils in each school. 
(2) Quarters away from regular school building. 
(3) Special methods of discipline. 
(4) Child study. 
(5) The very best teachers, teachers especially apt in teaching, governing, and 
disciplining children, 
Our schools—the regular schools, those for special instruction and discipline, 
rooms for individual work, special schools for backward or mentally deficient 
children—illustrate the fact that our public schools are increasing in complexity 
and adaptation to all classes of pupils. 
Relation between health and mental power.—Dr. Harrison Allen, the next speaker, 
called attention to the fact that, in the throat passage above the palate and back 
of the nose there is a space which is frequently so obstructed by the presence of a 
soft, tonsil-like mass as to prevent the normal passage of air from the nostril to 
the lung from taking place. No child is healthy who habitually breathes through 
the mouth. The respiratory movements, for the most part, are confined to the 
walls of the abdomen; hence the chest does not expand, the lower ribs fall together 
and the tips of the shoulder blades project. Dr. Allen directed attention to the 
injurious effect the throat mass may exert on mental functions. The physician 
sees many children who possess the throat growth and yet have normal brains, 
yet it is certainly as true that, as a rule, each afflicted child is mentally below the 
average. The temper is uncertain; the memory and power of attention imperfect. 
Not infrequently these peculiarities are so marked as to prevent the child from 
holding its own with a companion of its own age, and it is found in school with 
younger children, or at home under special care. Graver conditions are not tobe 
ignored. Occasionally the child is a mute orastammerer. The temper may be so 
excitable as to lead to phases of destructiveness, or the child may be quite intract- 
able. Even epileptic convulsions may ensue. Dr. Allen had no doubt that cases 
occur in every community of children who are classed as examples of ‘‘retarded 
development,” of ‘‘ juvenile depravity,” or of ‘‘ destructive mania,” where the real 
cause of the distress is not within the brain, but in the roof of the throat passage. 
He felt, therefore, that the attention of teachers and boards of management should 
be directed to these facts. Fortunately, the remedy is one easily and safely 
applied. It is to remove the throat mass by an operation. While not all phases 
of brain. arrest or perversion of mental function are to be connected with the 
growth, yet an enormous mass of unrelieved distress is to be associated with it. 
Dr. Allen was of the opinion that in all plans to educate the young systematic 
care of the throat passages should form a part, and particularly that every back- 
ward or defective child should be the subject of an expert medical examination 
before it is deprived of the privilege of education to which it is entitled. 
Character building in education.—Miss Mary C. Wister followed Dr. Allen and 
said: 
The side of the question to be treated by me is what kind of training is required 
by children who are unfitted for school life as it exists to-day; particularly the 
children disqualified by their own incapacity for mental effort, by what is known 
as incorrigibility, or by extreme poverty. No one would attempt to make students 
of such children. Some one should attempt to make of them honest, industrious 
ne Te

  men and women. A fraction of the appropriation now expended upon the depart- 
ment of charities and correction, if transferred to the establishment of special 
classes for such cases, would not be needed by that department in the future, and 
now much better spent! 
At present the children of well-ordered homes receive the additional benefit of 
fine mental training. The child without advantages of any kind gets none. To 
those unfamiliar with such conditions, the child obliged to obey nothing but the 
dictates of his own lawless wiil for twenty-four hours a day, is too unapproachable 
a problem to be considered. Even at this late day, with all the inventions of the 
modern mind to prevent all the things which should not be (in this most philan- 
thropic of cities), this child is allowed to roam our streets unmolested, except 
where private effort has reached him for a few hours a week, or one or two big 
societies have whisked him off to the country. Occasionally some one, who sends 
coal or clothes to his mother, remonstrates, and then the child is entered at a 
primary school, to stay—if it appeals to him at all—until suspended, in the course 
of which proceeding every one has assured him that he is a remarkably bad boy—a 
reputation that he not infrequently exemplifies later on. We all know such cases, 
and, fortunately, many of them by reason of a different environment, for a few 
hours each day, or the influence of some individual, turn the corner and start 
along the high road of hard work and self-respect. 
Children of the poor.—These children of the very poor do not deserve the hard 
names often used to describe them. They are not heartless. They are not stupid. 
They live up to their own standard of what is right, as well as many persons with 
better reasons for so doing. Their vices are surprisingly few, their surroundings 
considered. Their virtues, under the circumstances,aremany. Yetsuch children 
are likely to become a burden upon the State or unprofitable, unsatisfactory citizens 
at best, unless brought under some powerful influence for good. 
You say that these children need education. They do! They are in greater need 
of something, which—for want of a better name—I shall call civilization. Above 
everything else, these children lack two qualities most essential to the modern 
man, without which he is fitted only for a more primitive state of existence than 
the city of to-day. The qualities I speak of are application and self-control. "With- 
out self-control a child can not sit still on a chair. Without application he can 
not learn the A, B, C. And now we reach the point of how'the child—who can 
not study, work or even play consecutively—may be turned into a law-abiding 
citizen. Our subject, as we now view him, represents a point of view in which 
antagonism to everything and everybody is the leading feature. Not knowing 
how to control or apply himself, he does not enjoy any of the occupations that 
attract the disciplined minds of his neighbors who go to school, and he is in con- 
stant dread of having his freedom curtailed. Therefore, his youth is passed in 
keeping out of the way of every one, from the policeman up and down. There is 
one thing to be remembered before condemning this child as a hopeless case, which 
is, that any child will apply himself to study when he wants to learn. The whole 
trouble with this particular kind of child is that, while left in an untrained con- 
dition, he does not wish to learn. The remedy is simple. Change his point of 
view. And nothing will be gained by spending a moment upon training of any 
kind that does not lead to this result, z 
How the awakening comes.—There are, for example, three ways of treating a 
child’s dirty face. The first, to wash it for him; the second, tocompel him to wash 
it (in the majority of institutions this is done); the third, to make him wish to 
have his face clean. I do not claim that this is a quick method, but it is the only 
one that will give a child a clean face for life, and a clean face is followed by a 
clean character and a clean name more often than is commonly supposed. 
Perhaps a room in which a boy is not obliged to do anything is the best place for 
one who wishes to do nothing to take his first lesson; a place where, as long as he 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  
  154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
disturbs no one, no one disturbs him. He has taken the first step in the right 
direction when he has settled down in a quiet corner to do what thinking he is 
capable of and to observe for himself that other children are on the alert for teach- 
ers to talk or play with them. And, although he can not quite understand why, 
the other children, who don’t want the teachers to let them alone, seem to be hay- 
ing the best of it. Tho child sits and watches, and must be allowed to sit and 
watch until the awakening comes, as come it will. Sooner or later he comes for- 
ward to join the rest. The days of compulsion are past and he is ready to learn 
something of his own accord. At this stage, what he learns being altogether a 
secondary matter, the child is given as wide a choice of simple occupations as 
possible and character training begins. 
Without knowing the reason, the world he faces seems suddenly changed to a 
world of friends, for everyone is ready to help him in the accomplishment of his 
new ambition, and his heart is ready to take in the influences for good which are 
already making themselves felt. 
Training in self-control.—People seldom realize how easily the untrained mind, 
when turned in any direction, may be guided and controlled while being taught to 
guide and control itself, and to do this is the mission of the teacher. There area 
multitude of things for the child in question tolearn. Manners come first. Not 
to wear hats indoors; not to roll on the floor during a lesson; not to throw things 
at his teacher, and many demonstrations of a like nature which would make him 
an unwelcome addition to the well-managed schoolroom. Next come the princi- 
ples of right living, but these can not be taken up until our boy or girl has learned 
enough self-control to sit still and listen when spoken to. The sense of responsi- 
bility is, to my mind, the entering wedge by which right ideas and ideals may be 
taught. How can we impress the necessity for telling the truth upon the unde- 
veloped child? Only by obliging him to act it; by showing him that, keep his word 
and live up to it he can and must. Upon this standard of conduct does his future 
reputation depend, a standard within the possibility and comprehension of all; a 
standard by which all children are judged alike and alike are judged by all con- 
cerned in a character school. 
Then our boy must learn to work for his living instead of begging; to save his 
pennies for the day when his face will always be clean and he will wish to wear a 
collar. He must not tease deformed or little children; he must not expect more 
than his share of things, and be willing to give away part of that if necessary; he 
must at all times be ready to help others in whatever way he can, and remember 
to do such things without being told. 
And these are the lessons that teachers in character schools teach, while the 
child sings a song, plays a game, or listens to a story, unconscious that anything 
has happened, except that he has found someone who wants to see him all the 
time, who cares about what he does, and believes (he has absolute confidence in 
her word by this time) that he is going to make one of the best boys she has ever 
known. Such an experience as this brings many changes with it. In time it 
brings application and self-control, varying of course in degree with the child's 
capacity, fitting him for school life and that larger school—the world. If this city, 
in neighborhoods where such children abound, would open preliminary character- 
training classes, preparatory to the lower grades, we should hear less about chil- 
dren out of school, require less money to enforce the compulsory law, and be 
rewarded by upright, patriotic, self-respecting citizens. 
The recognition of the individual.—The next speaker, Dr. J. Madison Taylor, 
made a plea for the recognition of the individual in physical and mental treat- 
ment, and said that the first important thing in dealing with a child as an indi- 
vidual is to get some knowledge of his home atmosphere, particularly the mental 
and moral attitudes of the father and mother. The mother is the more important, 
because more constantly in association with her children. The father is not to be
-P-A-G-E-235
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 155 
  ignored, however, because of his great influence for good or evil, his boys and 
girls looking up to him as a sort of superior being, the representative of authority. 
The average mother, while not educated to be a mother, must be taken as she is 
found. Next to the parents, the social environment in which the children live 
_ must be considered. While truth is truth the world over, yet what passes cur- 
rent for truth among the humbler class is very different from what is truth among 
the upper classes, and so, indeed, is selfishness. Teachers must bear in mind that 
the average mental concepts of children are less high than would be supposed 
from the apparent intelligenco of their speech. . The child will use language glibly 
enough, and yet have a meager knowledge of the meaning of the words. Dr. Tay- 
lor then made some suggestions as to how to approach the average child. Long 
experience had taught the speaker that much the best method is to treat the child 
as an individual, much like one would treat one’s friends. To examine the men- 
tally deficient child one must be careful to avoid circumlocution. When thechild 
is suffering with physical defects or bodily ailments the mind reacts slowly, 
the apprehension is enfeebled, and the child appears to have a dull mind. The 
removal of the physical trouble will make a marked difference in the child’s men- 
tal products. 
The psychological and pedagogical problem of treating special classes of chil- 
dren.—Dr. Lightner Witmer, of the University of Pennsylvania, said: 
Are there children in the public schools that require more individual treatment 
than can be given by the teacher of graded classes? If so, what can the public- 
school system do to supply the treatment that is necessary? The psychological 
problem concerns itself with the discovery of such cases as reveal on examination 
deficiencies that the present teaching force, as now organized, can not cope with. 
The pedagogical problem calls for a determination of the most effective methods 
to be employed by the public-school system in meeting this demand. 
We teachers know that children differ greatly in mental and moral capacity. 
We try as far as possible to keep the members of a class together, and in doing 
this we grade according to age and examination average, and yet I believe that 
your experience is identical with mine, and confirms the opinion that a class of 
children, no matter how homogeneous the material may be, fails into three groups, 
or perhaps four. There. are always a very few exceedingly bright and able 
members of the class. This section, the teacher is frequently told, can get on well 
enough byitself. These able intellects and effective moral characters generally get 
a minimum from the school curriculum. Unfortunately they are neglected, and 
it is not to be wondered at if later in school life they drop down below their rela- 
tive level through the enervating effect of the daily dullness of the class room. 
Then there is another class at the opposite end, also not large in number, com- 
posed of the indifferent, lazy, or stupid boys, who drain the energies of the teacher, 
and by whom the teacher is unfortunately compelled to measure his efficiency. 
Lastly, there is the great middle section, composed of 50, perhaps of 60 or 75 per 
cent of the members, and divisible into two groups, one above and the other 
below an average. 
Perhaps the same thought has occured to you that impressed itself upon me 
when a teacher in a preparatory school in this city, that the greatest improve- 
ment in school work would come from separating a class into three groups. I 
should like to have taught separately the three groups into which I could divide 
my classes, and to have treated them by radically different methods. I always 
regretted that, owing to the class system, they were not obtaining the best that I 
could give them, nor were they doing the best that might be expected of them, 
because so many of them were compelled to adjust themselves to a class of stu- 
dents to which they did not belong. 
This rough estimation of individual differences within a class must be supple- 
mented by careful examination, if we are to determine with security those pupils
-P-A-G-E-236
156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97." 
  that depart most markedly from the average of the class, and if we are subse- 
quently to discover exactly wherein this departure is manifested, ascertain its 
causes, and finally suggest proper methods of treatment. Such an examination, 
if thoroughly made, should have due regard to hereditary tendencies, whether 
these be physical or mental, to the age and the condition in life of the pupil, to 
weight, height, lung capacity and muscular force, to hearing, to vision, to speech, 
to the rate of movement, to reaction time, to the time required in simple mental 
operations, to powers of attention, memory and imagination, to will power, and 
to moral characteristics. 
If such examinations be carefully conducted, it will be found that there are 
now in the public schools many cases that depart widely from the average. Their 
defects are such that they need careful treatment if they are not to fall still more 
below the level of their fellows in the progress of life. 
These children may be grouped into several classes. I have met with children 
in the Philadelphia schools who belong to each of these classes. The defects of 
some of them have been observed by their teachers; others have entirely escaped 
the teacher's observation. First, this class comprises those children who present 
moral characteristics that render their treatment in large classes impossible, no 
matter what the cause of moral deficiency may be. Second, those who are men- 
tally and physically much below the normal child of the same age. These two 
classes of children alone comprise at least one per cent of the present school pop- 
ulation. For their own benefit, as well as for the benefit of their teachers and 
fellow pupils, these classes of children should be instructed in special schools, 
equipped with a better-paid and more broadly educated teaching force than is 
needed for the average children found in the public schools Third, children 
who have defective hearing. I could cite case after case of children who have 
been called stupid, or inattentive, or lazy, or bad, merely because they could not 
hear what was said to them by their teachers. One child of the ninth B grade 
left school, and only discovered after he had tried to run an elevator that he was 
unable to hear a bell. He is now under treatment by a spécialist for a defect of 
hearing which should have been corrected long ago. If this had been discovered 
in time, he would have had the opportunity of enjoying the education that the 
city is supposed to extend to all its children, Fourth, children whose powers of 
vision are defective. This, again, is a very numerous class, and I could cite many 
instances, One case is that of a boy who for years has seen double and the page 
of whose reader was so blurred when he looked at it that only with the greatest 
difficulty could he distinguish one letter from another. He is in the tenth B grade 
and is 14 years of age, but reads about as well as a boy who is half way through 
the first reader. That he stands as well as he does is an evidence of unusual 
industry on his part. That his defect was not sooner discovered is an evidence of 
the immediate necessity of proper examination of all children for the discovery of 
possible eye defects. This boy’s eyes were treated by an oculist. He is now being 
taught to read and spell by one of his former teachers and by myself, because the 
school system makes no provision for such cases as his. The Penn Charter School, 
of this city, has taken a most advanced stand in this matter, requiring all boys in 
attendance to be thoroughly examined by specialists. Many defects of eyes and 
ears were found sufficiently serious to interfere with the school work. Fifth, 
children who have defects of speech. Proper articulation is not only necessary 
to convey ideas to other human beings; it is essential also for the harmonious 
development of the mind. A child with a defect of speech is liable to grow to be 
a mentally defective adult. 
The pedagogical remedy is to be found in the establishment of special or ungraded 
schools for those classes of children that may be called disciplinary cases and for 
those of generally deficient mental development, and, secondly, in some provision 
by the proper school agencies for the discovery of cases of defective powers of
-P-A-G-E-237
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 157 
hearing, sight, and speech, and for the pedagogical treatment of the backward 
mental development consequent upon such physical defects. 
Philadelphia’s need of special schools.—Dr. Edward Brooks, superintendent of 
public schools, concluded the discussion, as follows: 
There are several special schools under the control of the board of education 
but none belonging to the elementary grades, unless the James Forten School 
may be so regarded. We have children in our city of many different nationalities 
and of varying social and intellectual conditions, and it has been suggested that 
special schools be provided for them; but it does not seem to me to be necessary. 
A slight modification of the general curriculum, with an emphasis upon the indus- 
trial element of education, is desirable; but no new or different organization from 
that of our general elementary schools is needed to meet these conditions. The 
colored children, the Italians, Hungarians, and Russians ail need the same general 
training for intelligent and industrious citizenship. The methods of teaching 
should be varied to-suit their conditions, but no new organization into special 
schools is needed. 
If special schools are desirable in connection with the system of elementary 
education, they should probably embrace two classes of pupils; first, those of low 
power and aptitude of mind who can not advance as rapidly as the other children; 
and second, those who are confirmed in truancy and stubborn disobedience. In 
respect to defective children, there are not enough of them in our schools at present 
to collect them into a distinct class; and it might be considered a remedy of doubt- 
ful expediency to take the small number now in our schools and place them in 
classes by themselves. The association of the weak-minded with strong or nor- 
mally minded children is an advantage to the former, and so Iong as the number 
is small they are no special disadvantage to the normally minded pupils. Very 
serious cases of this kind should be placed in institutions similar to that of Elwyn, 
so long under the special care of Dr. Isaac Kerlin. 
Not many troublesome pupils.—So far as pupils guilty of truancy and stubborn 
disobedience are concerned, we have so few of them as not to call for any provi- 
sions for special schools. Under our present system we have butlittle knowledge 
of truancy, for, without any compulsion in the matter of attendance, the boy whose 
parents can not compel him to attend school is on the street without the knowledge 
of school authorities. That there are hundreds of such boys who ought to be in 
school can not be doubted; but teachers have no official knowledge of it. So also 
in respect to inveterate disobedience; the boy of this kind who enters school is 
borne with for awhile, until the patience of teachers and school board is exhausted, 
and at last dismissed from the school, graduating often, no doubt, into the peniten- 
tiary. 
Two years ago our State legislature passed a law providing for the compulsory 
education of the children of the Commonwealth. This law will probably be 
amended at the coming session of the legislature so that it can be put into execu- 
tion. Then will come anew state of affairs in our public schools that will demand 
new arangements to meet new conditions. When all the children are compelled 
to attend the public schools we shall meet with cases of inveterate truancy and 
stubborn disobedience beyond the control of teacher or parent. To turn these 
boys on the street will be a menace to-social order. It will, therefore, be the duty 
of the city to provide for their education, for the provision of a special school for 
the education of those boys is cheaper than the penitentiary for them when they 
become men. 
Several cities where the law of compulsory education has been in force for 
some time have found it their duty to provide for this class of children. The 
special schools of Providence, described by Mrs. Esten, are, as she has stated, ful- 
filling a very important mission in her city. I have been deeply interested in her
-P-A-G-E-238
158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  description of them, and I believe the system is worthy of the careful considera- 
tion of educators. With so large anumber of them in a comparatively small city 
it would seem that their schools are not restricted to incorrigible children unless 
the school population is unusually inclined to truancy and insubordination. Itis, 
of course, a question whether the association of these children, unless they are 
extremely vicious, with obedient and refined children might not be an advantage 
to the former without any special disadvantage to the well-behaved children, so 
long as the number of defective children is insignificant. From present informa- 
tion there seems to be but a sprinkling of these children in our schools, and not 
enough in any neighborhood to make a special class for them. I propose, how- 
ever, to make an early investigation to determine more accurately the number of 
such defective children in the schools, that I may be able to express a more defi- 
nite opinion in respect to the establishment of special classes. Whether there will 
arise a demand for special schools for this class of children in our city when an 
education becomes compulsory is a question for the future to determine. 
Provision for truant and disobedient pupils.—For a more confirmed class of tru- 
ant and disobedient children there is no doubt we shall be called upon to provide. 
Boston is just entering upon this experiment with an institution called a Parental 
School. The necessity of this school is emphasized in Superintendent Seaver’s 
report for 1895, in which, in referring to the school being ready to receive pupils, 
he remarks: ‘‘ This is a welcome announcement, for it must be said that the state 
of things that has existed in relation to truants the past few months could not be 
endured much longer without grave peril.” ‘Some truants,” he continues, “have 
already ripened into criminals and have been sent down to the House of Reforma- 
tion on criminal complaints; others—the greater number—have not been dealt 
with at all, because the Parental School was not ready to take care of them.” 
This experiment in Boston of a Parental School will be watched with great 
interest by the educators of the country. It was first:proposed to call it a truant 
school, but the name was changed to the more appropriate and suggestive one of 
Parental School, indicating, not the provision of penalties for disobedience, but 
rather that fatherly care and guidance that lead to virtuous habits and an 
upright life. 
Parental School of Boston.—The school is to be situated, as stated in the words 
of the law, ‘‘on the mainland, at some place removed from institutions occupied 
by criminal or vicious persons.” It is entirely distinct from the Home of Refor- 
mation, the two belonging respectively to great, but distinct, functions of the 
State, the one being penal and the other educational. The law provides that the 
educational authorities, in case of uncontrollable truancy and disobedience, shall 
apply to the courts in order to remove boys from the control of their natural 
parents and place them under control of the parental schools. Before the estab- 
lishment of this school incorrigible boys were sent to the reform school called the 
House of Reformation, where they were placed with the criminal classes, an 
institution in many cases which was a school of vice to them, The danger of 
this course caused the authorities to delay the coercive treatment of incorrigible 
boys until, as Superintendent Seaver remarks, ‘‘truancy ripened into positive 
criminality.” By earlier commitments to the Parental School the first steps in 
crime will be prevented, and many boys, it is believed, will be saved from being 
sent to the House of Reformation. 
The Parental School is to be in no sense a penal institution, designed to inflict 
penalties for truancy, but a school in which boys may be induced to remain by 
virtue of the attractive environments that may be thrown around them. The 
object is to make the school so attractive and surround the boys with such influ- 
ences—with a minimum of coercion—as to develop the spirit of self-respect and 
intelligent self-control. It is hoped that the school will create a spirit and atmos-
-P-A-G-E-239
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 159 
phere of its own that will exercise a reformative influence upon all who come 
within its walls. 
Incentives to good behavior.—As an incentive to good behavior it is proposed to 
apply to all who are committed to the Parental School the principle of the inde- 
terminate sentence, so that though a boy might be committed for two years, his 
term could be shortened through good behavior and the manifestation of the 
right disposition. A system of licenses has been prepared whereby boys appear- 
ing to have acquired habits of regularity, punctuality, and self-control after six 
months’ residence, shall be permitted to return to their homes on condition of 
attending the day schools regularly and behaving properly, which seems to be in 
accordance with the correct laws of reform. 
This institution is provided exclusively for boys, but Superintendent Seaver 
recommends that a similar institution be established for girls. ‘Evidence 
enough,” he says, ‘‘to convince the most skeptical of the need of such a school 
could be gathered from the principals of girls’ schools and from the truant offi- 
cers. Until this need is met,” he continues, ‘‘it can not be said that the educa- 
tional authorities of the city are doing their full duty by the wayward and 
morally exposed girls under their care.” 
We have not met this condition of affairs in our schools under the system of 
voluntary attendance. But if the law of compulsory education shall force all 
classes of girls into our schools we shall no doubt find cases of such abnormal 
moral conditions arising from heredity and vicious surroundings that a parental 
school for girls may become a necessity in our city. 
Ihave referred quite freely in this discussion to the experiment about to be 
made in Boston, because they have already been confronted with the problem and 
have been working toward its solution for several years. I close my paper with 
another extract from Superintendent Seaver’s report, which shows the relation of 
parental schools to the system of popular education and the necessity of their 
existence. ‘‘The State,” he says, ‘‘has undertaken for its own protection to make 
education universal. To make education universal it must be made free, and it 
must also be made compulsory. Therefore no system of public education is com- 
plete without schools for truants, wherein are used the last resorts of compulsory 
education. When these fail, and not until then, can children rightly be surren- 
dered by the educational to the criminal jurisdiction of the State.” 
In other words, it is only after the school has exhausted its power for reform 
that the prison shall be resorted to for punishment or protection. Only after the 
school shall have failed in its endeavor to train boys to virtuous citizenship 
should the penitentiary open its doors to protect society from the vicious and 
criminal classes. In another year it is probable that the law will by compulsion 
open the schools to many who are now growing up in ignorance and vice, and it 
is the hope of patriotic citizens that it may save many an unfortunate boy and 
girl from a life of vice and crime. Special schools of this kind will be found to be 
a necessity to society and the State. 
An editorial of the Wisconsin Journal of Education touching upon 
the question under discussion may find room here, since the writer 
urges the establishment of separate classes for still another reason: 
An ungraded depariment.—Among the improvements needed in many city 
schools is one of very great importance, if we look at the usefulness of the schools 
to the pupils and not merely to the perfection of the machine. An ungraded 
department, or in a very large city several such, could be made useful in these 
ways: 
1. Those children who are out of grade for any reason and who therefore are 
thrown back into the next lower grade, or who are carried along with difficulty in 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the grade for which they are only partly prepared, could have a much better 
opportunity for study in an ungraded department. It is true that efforts are 
frequently made to accommodate these children at the sacrifice of time and 
patience by the teachers. But the graded system is unfavorable to all who can 
not keep step with its regular march. Among those who are now out of grade 
and who need such an opportunity are those who have stayed out of school for sick 
ness, those who have stayed out to work at home or elsewhere, those who have 
-moved into the city from other places with a different course of study, and those 
idle or dull pupils who do not keep up with their grades. The mere enumeration 
of these classes shows that there must be many pupils who are out of grade for 
good reasons and whose needs ought to be carefully considered. Especially as 
pupils get into the upper grades of the ward schools are they apt to be needed by 
parents for work for irregular lengths of time. With an ungraded department 
such pupils could come back when not at work and at least finish the ward-school 
course. As it is, one or two attempts to keep up with their classes generally 
satisfies them that their education must close. It is very desirable that as many 
pupils as possible shall complete the ward-school course, which is the proper prepa- 
ration for life and for citizenship. All the arguments for free schools for all 
children are arguments for so shaping these schools that no unnecessary barriers 
shall stand between the child and a good common-school education. 
2. Another sort of children for whom an ungraded department is much needed 
are those whose deportment is so bad in the graded schools as to interfere with 
their own school work and that of others, and also those who frequently stay out 
of school without their parents’ consent. These children are likely to turn out 
badly if simply expelled from school or allowed to drift away from it. They 
ought to be saved. An ungraded school with a skillful and firm teacher will save 
many of them from the idleness and other bad influences of the street. It is bet: 
ter to reform these children at home if we can rather than in a State reform 
school. In many cases these children are not very bad, only they have no great 
love for study, and the teacher has not tact or time to attract them. A little per- 
sonal influence would save them, but that little is not given, for the reason that 
we can not get all the wisdom and patience and power of a great teacher for $30 
amonth. With cheap teachers we get cheap work. If this class of boys and girls 
are sent to the ungraded school, it will be necessary to have a man of special char- 
acter and power of government as well as tact in managing and making school 
attractive. He must be a born teacher, but he need not be a great scholar. 
Such an ungraded department ought to cost something. But it would pay, in 
relieving the regular schools of some hard problems and in saving the boys and 
girls. 
  SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
School savings banks, also called penny savings banks, have been 
established in nearly all European countries during the last thirty 
years. They are especially numerous in France, Belgium, England, 
and Scotland, but less popular in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, 
and Italy. In Germany there are provinces and States, such as the 
Kingdom of Saxony, the Prussian provinces of Silesia, Saxony, and 
Posen, the duchies of Meiningen and Brunswick, in which every vil- 
lage and town has a school savings bank. In the city of Breslau 
thirty of the public schools have each a bank, but the grand total of
-P-A-G-E-241
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 161 
depositors and deposits is not equal to that of France and a few other 
countries. The first school savings banks ever established are founé 
in Goslar (1820) and in Apolda (1833). Both towns are in Germany, 
Goslar near the Harz Mountains and Apolda in Thuringia. 
Germany in 1896 had 1,728 school savings banks, with 227,442 
depositors, which was an increase of 144 banks and 38,353 depositors 
over the previous year. The amount deposited in 1895 was 1,761,972 
marks, or $419,349.34, while in 1896 the total amount was 4,716,440 
marks, or $1,122,512.72, and the annual deposit was over a third of a 
million dollars. 
France (according to a newspaper item accepted as authentic by 
the author of ‘‘ XIII. Bericht des Vereins fiir Jugendsparkassen” in 
Breslau, Germany) had in 1893 more savings banks for school 
children than the German Empire had in 1896, to wit, 19,631, with 
438,967 depositors and deposits of over 13,000,000 franes (about 
$2,600,000). 
In England (according to the ‘Savings Bank,” 1895, No. 20) the 
so-called postage-stamp savings banks are chiefly used by young peo- 
ple. In 1894 there were given out 133,000 savings cards at 1 shilling 
each and 69,500 at 4 shillings each. This gives a total of 419,220 
shillings, or about $105,000. This manner of fostering thrift is intro- 
duced in 2,770 schools, or an increase of 279 schools over 1893. But 
there.are also penny banks in 155 schools. Deposits are called for at. 
stated periods by postal clerks and sent free of charge to the nearest 
general post-office. Two hundred and ninety-seven schools availed 
themselves of this generosity. The report of the department of pub- 
lic instruction for England and Wales for 1893-94 states that 8,548 
schools have made provision for saving, an increase of 2,165 schools 
over the previous year. In Scotland 150 schools and in Ireland 130 
schools have established banks during the year. These two states 
have altogether over 4,000 penny savings banks connected with 
schools. In 1894 there were distributed 275,000 bank-deposit books 
and 107,000 postal-savings cards. 
Belgium.—l’Etoile Belge states the number of school savings 
banks in the kingdom to have been 5,282 in 1893. The total number 
of schools is 8,040. Of the whole number of pupils, to wit, 964,354, as 
many as 195,441 have bank books. To this number should be added 
44,864 children whose savings amount to less than 1 frane in each 
ease, and who are, therefore, not yet entitled to a bank book. Hence 
the whole number of chiidren who save is 240,305, or an increase of 
about 20,000 over the previous year. The total amount of deposits 
was 5,165,228 frances, or $1,033,000; about one-half of this is to be 
deducted as having come from adults and pupils of secondary schools. 
The latest report shows an increase of 650,000 francs, or $130,000. The 
boys seem more inclined to save than the girls. In Germany and 
ED 97. 11    
-P-A-G-E-242
    162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. . won eh 
other countries the reverse is found. Belgium had 131,485 boys and 
only 108,820 girls who deposited their savings, while the enrollment 
showed that there were only 50 fewer girls than there were boys in 
school. The Independence Belge, however, states that the 16 girls’ 
schools in Antwerp had, in 1894, a larger deposit than the 18 — 
schools of that city. 
Switzerland.—Loeal reports gleaned from newspapers prove that 
the idea of school savings banks is making commendable progress, 
but the federal statistical bureau reports that in 1896 only 280 primary 
or elementary schools had savings banks; 24 are about to establish 
them, and in 23 schools the banks have been abandoned. The entire 
canton of Ziirich has only 20 such institutions. 
Jtaly.—The report for 1890 indicated a large inerease for the year 
1888, since then the number of juvenile depositors and their deposits 
have decreased. The following numbers show this. 
  
Year. Depositors. Deposits. 
  
496, 564 lire, or $99, 300 445, 555 lire, or 89, 100 408, 316 lire, or 81,600 395, 444 lire; or 79,000 
  Austria~-Hungary.—There are no recent reports concerning school 
savings banks in the Austrian Empire. : 
United States of America.—Mr. J.H. Thiry, in Long Island City, 
N. Y., reports that on March 16, 1895, there were 323 schools in the 
United States in which 1,579 class-room savings banks were in opera- 
tion. These schools are found in 83 cities. The number of deposi- 
tors was 30,921, and the deposits amounted to $402,020.90, and with- 
drawals to $244,856.74, which left $157,164.16 in the banks. This does 
not give a correct statement, inasmuch as in 14 schools the deposits 
are footed up since the establishment of the banks. The reports of 
20 schools were missing, and a previous statement was made in foot- 
ing up the totals. However, since 1890, when 209 schools with 1,110 
banks were reported, commendable progress is noticeable, for the 
number of schools having banks is (in 1896) 323, while the number of 
depositors has increased from 24,067 to 30,921. 
In the Journal of Education (Boston) Mr. Thiry published (July 
8,1897) a list of school savings banks in the United States, which is 
here reproduced.

Nore.—It is suggested that only in a small number of States is the savings-bank 
system on a basis justifying a teacher or school officer in taking the responsibility 
of advising depositing in a particular bank, while in European countries the Goy- 
ernment, through postal savings banks or otherwise, guarantees safety of the 
deposits. 
ATTENDANCE IN BOYS’ HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE KINGDOM OF PRUSSIA. 
Prussia, the largest of the 26 States of the Empire of Germany, has a 
little more than three-fifths of the population of the Empire, 31,849,795 
according to the census of 1895 (about one-half of the population of 
the United States according to the census of 1890). The population 
of the Empire of Germany was 52,246,589 in 1895. 
The following table shows the number of boys’ high schools of the 
six varieties in existence in Prussia, and the number of students 
attending them. These data are given for a number of years, dating 
back to 1830. The changes that have taken place within sixty-five 
years are very noticeable. While in 1830 the Kingdom had only 133 
classical high schools (gymnasia), in 1895 there were 274 classical, 91 
modern, and 86 mixed high schools, or 569 in all, with the incom- 
plete institutions. The number of students has risen from about 
35,000 in 1853 to 150,548 in 1895, or nearly 400 per cent within about 
forty years. 
To explain the shifting from classical to modern schools, it may be 
stated that the gymnasia and progymnasia teach Latin and Greek and 
one modern tongue in addition to mathematical and natural sciences, 
history, geography, drawing, music, ete. The real-schulen teach no 
ancient but two modern languages, while the real-gymnasia are mixed 
institutions, in which Latin and two modern tongues are taught, but 
no Greek. The headings of the different columns state for what pro- 
fessions the schools are preparatory institutions. With these facts 
before us, we see that the modern high schools have increased greatly, 
while the classical schools have barely kept up with the increase of
-P-A-G-E-245
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 165 
  the population, and have even decreased during the last eight years. 
This is explained by the overcrowding of the learned professions and 
the new demands which modern industry and commerce make. 
No special schools are included in the table, that is, no secondary, 
technical, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or trade schools. The 
table includes only schools belonging to the State system of general 
education, i. e., general culture schools preparing for higher study in 
universities and technological institutions. 
One reason for the increased attendance upon secondary schools in 
Prussia is that students of any secondary school (including normal 
schools), serve in the army only one year instead of three years, if they 
pass successfully through the first six grades. Another cause of the 
increase is found in the greater demands life makes upon trained 
intelligence, and the Prussian Government has ever been alive to 
these increased demands. 
The following ratios are obtained from the totals of the year 1895: 
Prussia had one classical high school for every 100,125 inhabitants, 
and 398 classical students to every 100,000 inhabitants. 
Prussia had one mixed high school to every 212,322 inhabitants, 
and 88 students of such schools to every 100,000 inhabitants. 
Prussia had one modern high school for every 349,997 inhabitants, 
and 93 students of such schools to every 100,000 inhabitants. 
Taking the schools together, we find that Prussia had in 1895 one 
high school of some kind for boys to every 55,975 inhabitants, and 
212 students in every 100,000 inhabitants. 
The table presented below includes only boys’ schools. There are 
not as many separate secondary schools for girls in Prussia, called 
‘‘héhere Madchenschulen,” nor are they of such high grade as the 
boys’ schools. Their course rarely goes beyond the eighteenth year 
of the pupil’s age, but they are high schools in the American sense of 
the word. Exact statements of attendance are lacking, for they are 
mostly private schools. The number of girls in secondary schools 
is estimated at not less than 100,000. 
This brings the number of students in secondary schools to 250,000. 
If we add to this the number of students in special schools, such as 
technical, industrial, trade, commercial, and agricultural, as well as 
normal schools, the total goes beyond 300,000, or 1 per cent of the 
population. Statistics have shown that one-fifth of the population 
in Germany, also in Prussia, is attending school. This raises the 
percentage of secondary students to 5 per cent of the population in 
school. It is doubtful whether the ratio can be found in any other 
country, unless it be in the United States, where many colleges might 
be classed among the secondary schools.

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 167 
PROPORTION OF CATHOLICS, PROTESTANTS, AND HEBREWS IN SECOND- 
ARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY. 
In an article in the Akademische Revue, published in Munich, on 
“<The proportion of Catholics, Protestants, and Hebrews in attendance 
upon secondary educational institutions of Germany,” the following 
table is reduced from Professor Rethwisch’s voluminous statisties in 
**Deutschland’s hoheres Unterrichtswesen im 19ten Jahrhundert.” 
There are in attendance upon secondary schools (i. e., preparatory 
schools for higher seats of learning): 
| of every | Of every | Of every | Of every | 10,000 in- | — 10,000" [10,000 Prot-| — 10,000 habitants. | Catholics.| estants. | Hebrews. 
In Bavaria. 42 67 
In Prussia, 3 50. 
in Saxony, In Wiirtemberg- In Baden - 
In Hesse... 
    
These 6 of the 26 States constituting the German Empire represent 
87 per cent of the total population of the Empire. 
According to the foregoing table fewer Catholics pursue a higher 
course of study than Protestants, and the Israelites far outnumber 
both. 
Furthermore, Protestants and Israelites are also more strongly rep- 
resented (proportionally) than Catholics in the so-called ‘‘real- 
schulen” (modern high schools) of every German State. In these 
modern high schools (so named in contradistinction to ‘‘gymnasia,” 
or classical high schools) comparison is less favorable to Catholics 
than in the more privileged classical schools, as the following state- 
ment proves: 
In Bavaria 20 of every 10,000 inhabitants attend modern high schools 
and 33 attend classical high schools; that is, 13 Catholics, 29 Protes- 
tants, and 208 Israelites are found in modern high schools, and in 
gymnasia 29 Catholics, 38 Protestants, and 162 Israelites of every 
10,000 of each of these creeds. 
According to these figures in Bavaria there are one and one-third 
more Protestants than Catholics in the classical schools and two and 
one-fourth times more in schools without Latin. The Israelites out- 
number the Christian creeds in the preparation of a business career, 
as well as in the preparatory education for professional service and 
the higher offices of public life.
-P-A-G-E-248

These proportions are analogous in the other parts of Germany, as 
is represented in the following table:

In all these States the same relations exist. Not only do Catholics 
attend the classical educational institutions less frequently, but they 
are not found in proportion to the other creeds in attendance at any 
kind of high school. Schools without Latin (for which modern lan- 
guages are substituted) and the mixed high schools (with Latin, but 
without Greek) show this discrepancy in greater proportion than the 
classical schools (named gymnasia). 
The paper quoted defines the main causes to be (a) the celibacy of 
the Catholic clergy, since the Protestant ministers’ families furnish a 
large contingent of students to the high schools; and (b) the distrust 
which Catholics generally entertain against all kinds of State schools. 
The numerical proof of quantitative retrogression of Catholics in 
regard to secondary and higher education indicates a qualitative dis- 
proportion in national intellectual life. The Catholics have no pri- 
vate institutions which could supply the apparent discrepancy. 
Details show an increase of the disproportion in Bavaria (as also in 
Prussia, Baden, and Saxony) during the period of 1863 to 1890. In 
1863 the attendance at secondary schools of Bavaria showed a pro-  
-P-A-G-E-249
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 169 
portion of 62.67 per cent Catholics, 34.27 per cent Protestants, and 
3.06 per cent Israelites, while in 1890 the proportion had changed to 
57.09 per cent Catholics, 36.09 per cent Protestants, and 6.82 per cent 
Israelites. 
The well-known statistician, Professor Georg von Mayr, generahizes 
the above-mentioned data as follows: 
In round numbers, out of every 10,000 inhabitants of the German 
Empire (excluding Oldenburg, which State does not publish statis- 
tical data of public education) 50 attend secondary schools, or 55 
students of every 10,000 Protestants; 32 students of every 10,000 
Catholics; 49 students of every 10,000 Dissenters; 333 students of 
every 10,000 Israelites; which gives an average of a fraction less than 
50 for the entire population. 
If a distinction be made among the different kinds of secondary 
schools, Wiirtemberg must be left out of consideration, because of 
the lack of appropriate data. The following result is then obtained:

Total population 
Consequently, the total population of Germany enjoys a secondary 
education to the extent of 50 out of 10,000 inhabitants, or 5 per 1,000; 
whereas, distinguishing the population by creeds, the proportion is: 
Thirty-two of every 10,000 Catholies, 55 of every 10,000 Protestant, 
and 333 of every 10,000 Israelites. 
Professor von Mayr states further, that proportionately the differ- 
ence is smallest in the classical schools. Not quite 28 of every 10,000 
Protestants pursue the classical courses; about 21 out of every 10,000 
Catholics. The Israelites alone show a strong diminution in this case 
as compared with the previously stated ratios, showing a proportion 
of nearly 174 to 10,000. The difference between Catholics and Prot- 
estants at other high schools of both kinds is relatively much greater. 
Combining the two kinds of schools, from 10 to 11 out of every 10,000 
Catholics, almost 26 out of every 10,000 Protestants, and more than 
158 out of every 10,000 Israelites pursue a high-school course of study 
without Greek or without either classical language. 
Professor von Mayr shows, with reference to the gymnasia in 
Bavaria, that since 1873 the attendance of Catholics contrasted with 
Protestants has only slightly decreased; the attendance at technical  
-P-A-G-E-250
170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
courses was small even at that time. He closes his article with these 
words: 
In the struggle for existence the Catholic population of Bavaria undoubtedly 
needs the equipment of knowledge and power to be acquired by attendance at sec- 
ondary and higher seats of learning; for by not attending secondary schools they 
exclude themselves from universities and professional schools. It is, therefore, 
the earnest duty of all concerned to investigate and establish the causes of the 
nonattendance of Catholics at such schools, whether the opportunity given be not 
accepted or whether the opportunity required be not offered by the State. 
  And he further says: 
I should like to warn my readers not to draw immediate conclusions from the 
relative proportion of the different confessions upon the talent or inclination of the 
students, or the confession to which they belong. There are other considerations 
that determine the real participation in any branch of education besides talents 
and inclination, and among these are the ease or difficulty of attending certain 
schools. These are dependent upon the habitation of the parents and the location 
of the schools. Doubtless the residents of any place or city furnish the compar- 
atively greatest contingent of students. Now, it must be considered that the Jew- 
ish population is nearly always found in large cities which have a variety of schools 
beyond the scope of the elementary schools. Hence, we find the Jewish children 
more frequently in secondary schools, while the Catholics are chiefly agriculturists, 
farmers, and the like, and live in hamlets, villages, and small towns, which do not 
offer such opportunities for secondary education as large cities do. Similar pro- 
portions are found where the members of one confession are preferably grouped in 
larger cities, as, for instance, the Protestants in upper Bavaria, where the partici- 
pation of Protestants in secondary schools is comparatively larger than in lower 
Bavaria, where they are found both in the cities and in rural districts. 
To the foregoing details another writer, Professor von Salvisberg, 
adds a few data taken from the Prussian educational statistics, which 
are of general interest. 
The attendance of the different creeds at secondary schools of Prus- 
sia from 1886 to 1890-91 averages the following proportions, expressed 
in percents?:

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 171 
  This showing should be completed by stating the proportion of the 
different creeds in the population, which is here given for Germany 
and for Prussia and Bavaria separately: 
In 1890 Germany had 49,428,470 inhabitants, of whom there were 
31,026,810 Protestants (62.8 en cent), 17,674,921 Catholics (35.8 per 
cent), and 567,884 Israelites (1.2 per cent). 
In 1890 Prussia alone had 29,952,675 inhabitants, of which there 
were 19,232,449 Protestants (64.2 per cent), 10,252,818 Catholics (34 
per cent), and 372,059 Israelites (1.2 per cent). 
In 1890 Bavaria alone had 5,484,475 inhabitants, of which there 
were 1,571,863 Protestants (28.6 per cent), 3,962.941 Catholics (70.2 
per cent), and 53,885 Israelites (1.2 per cent). 
According to the foregoing figures the Catholic attendance at sec- 
ondary schools falls short by more than one-third in comparison with 
the total population of the State of Prussia, and gives its share to the 
Protestant and Hebrew population. Israelites send almost eight 
times as many pupils to these institutions as would be expected from 
their proportion to the other creeds. If the creeds were distributed 
in attendance at school in proportion to the male population, there 
would be about 87 ,000 Protestant students, 47,000 Catholics, and 1,600 
Jews. 
The distribution of the different creeds among professional and 
business men is noticeable. If we take for granted that almost all 
who enter the higher State and municipal service are graduates of 
classical high schools and determine in what proportion the different 
ereeds graduate, the percentage of classical school graduates (for the 
period of five years above mentioned) will be found to average 68.5 
per cent for Protestants, 23.3 per cent for Catholics, and 8 per cent 
for Jews, or almost the same difference as is revealed in reviewing the 
attendance at gymnasia. 
Calculating from the statistics of Prussian universities for the years 
1886-1890, we find that among 100 students from German States 71.96 
were Protestants, 18.73 Catholics, and 8.98 Hebrews. The correct 
numbers for this calculation are given below. During the above men- 
tioned five years the universities of Prussia were attended by students 
from the German States as follows:

these alone and expressing the facts in per cents, we find among stu- 
dents from German States the following ratios:

  The participation of the Hebrews in higher education keeps pace 
with the advancement of the grade attained. The numberof Catho- 
lies who aim at a career which implies a university course in Bavaria 
is apposite to Prussia also. 
As stated above, the deeper reasons for this fact are not apparent 
and can not be statistically determined. The fact itself is defined 
in the following figures: During the period specified the number of 
Prussian students averaged 7,898 Protestants to 9,411,161 Protestant 
male inhabitants; 2,249 Catholics to 5,058,292 Catholic male inhab- 
itants; 1,044 Hebrews to 182,738 Hebrew male inhabitants; 33 
others to 49,960 other male inhabitants; a total of 11,224 students to 
14,702,151 male inhabitants. 
This goes to show that of every 10,000 male inhabitants of each 
ereed there averaged 8.37 Protestants, 4.45 Catholics, and 57.13 
Israelites; on the whole, 7.62 students. The great variations in uni- 
versity attendance among the different creeds permit a conclusion 
upon anomalous conditions. The Catholic population yields a little 
more than half as many students as the Protestant. The Hebrew, on 
the other hand, sends proportionately thirteen times as many students 
to universities as the Catholics and seven times as many as the 
Protestants. If we examine the conditions mentioned, even in a 
single province of the Kingdom, the freshmen from the Catholic 
population approach the average Protestant attendance only in West- 
phalia, Hanover, and East Prussia. In the other nine provinces the 
facts portrayed are repeated even with greater force. It appears, 
therefore, that a combination of manifold conditions, external and 
internal, economic and social, has developed permanent relations 
which in their effects upon the intellectual life of the nation must be 
far-reaching and powerful. 
EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS OF THE KINGDOM OF BAVARIA FOR 
THE YEAR 1893-94, 
The Zeitschrift des Bayerischen Statistischen Bureaus No. 4 of 
1895 contains the latest educational data of Bavaria. A summary of 
this official publication is here given in translation, in which the
-P-A-G-E-253
EDUCATION IN, CENTRAL EUROPE. 173 
schools and other institutions of training are grouped somewhat after 
our American nomenclature. 
A.—ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
I.—DAY SCHOOLS. 
  The number of elementary day schools in the Kingdom (population 
in 1895, 5,797,414) was 7,253, of which 346, or 4.8 per cent, are located 
in the cities (which term embraces the cities of the first rank on the 
right side of the Rhine and the eleven large cities of the Palatinate), 
and 6,907, or 95.2 per cent, in the rural districts and villages. In the 
previous year the numbers were 7,239 schools, of which 342, or 4.7 
per cent, were situated in cities, and 6,897, or 95.2 per cent, in the 
country. 
Classed according to the character of their administration, there 
were 7,203, or 99.3 per cent, public, and 50, or 0.7 per cent, private 
schools. There has been no change in this proportion since the pre- 
ceeding year. 
Classed according to their religious character, there were 5,114, or 
70.5 per cent, Catholic (1892-93, 5,103, or 70.5 per cent); 1,910, or 26.3 
per cent, Protestant (1892-93, 1,909, or 26.4 per cent); 141, or 2 per 
cent, mixed schools (1892-93, 139, or 1.9 per cent), and 88, or 1.2 per 
cent, Hebrew schools (1892-93, the same number). 
If we consider the sex of the pupils, we find that there are 6,280, or 
86.6 per cent, mixed schools in all classes—that is to say, schools in 
which the sexes are not separated. In the previous year this propor- 
tion was 86.8 per cent. Four hundred and twenty-seven, or 5.9 per 
cent (1892-93, 416, or 5.7 per cent), are exclusively girls’ schools; 425, 
or 5.8 per cent (1892-93, 417, or 5.8 per cent), boys’ schools, and 121, 
or 1.7 per cent (1892-93, 125, or 1.8 per cent), are mixed schools in 
some of the grades only. 
If we classify the schools according to the length of their daily ses- 
sions, we find that 6,978, or 96.2 per cent, are all-day schools; 238, or 
3.3 per cent, are half-day schools, and 37, or 0.5 per cent, have a partly 
whole and partly half day session. The proportions for the preceding 
year were as follows: 6,942, or 95.9 per cent, whole-day schools; 259, 
or 3.6 per cent, half-day schools, and 38, or 5 per cent, mixed schools. 
The number of classes in all the schools is 13,625 (in 1892-93, 13,524), 
of which 2,775, or 20.4 per cent (in 1892-93, 2,731, or 20.2 per cent), 
are found in cities, and 10,850, or 79.6 per cent (in 1892-93, 10,793, or 
79.8 per cent), in rural districts. Of the total numberof ciasses, 1,092, 
or 8 per cent, are parallel classes of which 941, or 86.1 per cent, are 
found in city schools, and 151, or 13.8 per cent, in country schools. 
The total number of teachers is 24,252 as against 24,101 in the pre- 
vious year; of these 13,714, or 56.5 per cent, are class teachers—i. e., 
teachers in charge of class rooms—(in 1892-93, 13,611) 6,124, or 25.3 
per cent, are teachers of religion, and 4,414, or 18.2 per cent, teachers
-P-A-G-E-254
174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  of gymnastics, drawing, and female handiwork, i. e., special teachers. 
Of the 13,714 regular class teachers, there are 11,707, or 85.4 per cent, 
men, and 2,007, or 14.6 per cent, women. Of the 4,414 specialists, 
only 122, or 2.8 per cent, are men, and 4,292, or 97.2 per cent, are 
women. The 6,124 religious teachers are all men. 
Classifying the 24,252 teachers according to religious denominations, 
we find that 17,942, or 73.9 per cent, are Catholics (1 2, or 50.9 per 
cent, men, 5,590, or 23 per cent, women); 6,126, or 25.26 per cent, 
Protestants (5,428, or 22.38 per cent, men, and 698, or 2.88, per cent, 
women); 179, or 0.74 per cent, Israelites (169, or 0.7 per cent, men, 10, 
or 0.4 per cent, women); 5, or 0.2 per cent, belong to other denomina- 
tions (4 men, 1 woman). 
There are 1,033, or 7.5 per cent, of the regular class teachers who 
belong to religious orders. Of these 28, or 0.2 per cent, are men; 
1,005, or 7.3 per cent, of the whole number are women. 
The total number of day-school pupils in the Kingdom was 819,565; 
of these 146,004, or 17.8 per cent, attended city schools; 673,561, or 
82.2 per cent, attended rural schools; 402,082, or 49.1 per cent, were 
boys; 417,483, or 50.9 per cent, were girls; 585,210, or 71.4 per cent, 
were Catholics; 227,896, or 27.81 per cent, were Protestants; 5,789, 
or 0.71 per cent, were Hebrews; 670, or 0.08 per cent, were of other 
creeds. 
For the previous year the corresponding numbers were 144,550, or 
17.7 per cent, attending city schools; 673,039, or 82.3 per cent, attend- 
ing rural schools; 400,379, or 49 per cent, were boys; 417,210, or 51 per 
cent, were girls; 581,908, or 71.17 per cent, were Catholics; 228,961, 
or 28.01 per cent, were Protestants; 6,050, or 0.74 per cent, were 
Hebrews; 670, or 0.08 per cent, were of other creeds. 
The foregoing numbers permit a comparison which reveals (1) that 
the city population in Bavaria increases, though not at the expense of 
the rural population; (2) that the number of Catholic school children 
increases, while that of Protestant children decreases. The differ- 
ences shown are small, but they are the result of only one year. 
In 1893-94 there were 2,907,940 separate cases of absence recorded, 
amounting to 5,333,398 days, which is an average of 6.4 days for each 
child. The amount of absence during the previous year was about 
6.5 days for each child. Of the 2,907,940 cases of absence, 446,247 
occurred in city schools (15.3 per cent), 2,461,693 (or 84.7 per cent) 
cases in country schools. Since 17.8 per cent of all pupils are attend- 
ing city schools, the difference is comparatively slight. 
Of the total number of cases of absence only 158,862, or 5.5 per 
cent, were not excused, and hence the law took effect, according to 
which the parents were fined. In 2,086,637 (or 71.7 per cent) cases, 
the excuse was illness, and in 662,441 (or 22.8 per cent) cases, other 
valid excuses were offered and accepted. 
Instruction was given in 7,538 buildings (in 1892-93, 7,511), of    
   
   
-P-A-G-E-255

  which 338, or 4.5 per cent, were located in cities; 7,200, or 95.5 per 
cent, in the country and villages. Furthermore, 7,102, or 94.2 per 
cent, were school buildings owned by the communities (in 1892-93, 
7,087); 436, or 5.8 per cent, were rented buildings (in 1892-93, 424). 
All these buildings numbered 13,909 schoolrooms, against 13,823 of 
the year preceding. 
_ Tuition fees were paid in 5,502 schools, or in 75.9 per cent of the 
total number of schools, amounting to 1,615,417 marks, or $384,469.25, 
The city children contributed only 4.5 per cent of this sum, which 
shows that the principle of gratuitous elementary instruction is also 
making progress in Bavaria. In Prussia and other States of Germany 
the principle is now rigidly carried out. The people in Germany are 
gradually adopting the American popular idea that compulsory ele- 
mentary education presupposes or necessitates gratuity. 
During the year 1893-94 there were 3,211 cases of death among 
school children (in 1892-93, 2,923); 514, or 16 per cent, occurred in 
cities, and 2,699, or 84 per cent, in the country; 1,488, or 46.3 per 
cent, cases were boys, and 1,723, or 53.7 per cent, cases were girls. The 
percentage of cases of death was 0.4 per cent of the whole number of 
school children. 
Il.—SUNDAY SECULAR SCHOOLS. 
The total number of pupils in Sunday secular schools (so-called 
supplementary or continuation schools) in 1893-94 amounted to 
297,245. Of these, 35,980, or 12.1 per cent, were in cities; 261,265, 
or 87.9 per cent, were in rural districts; 151,434, or 44.2 per cent, 
were boys; 165,811, or 55.8 per cent, were girls; 216,670, or 72.89 per 
eent, were Catholics; 79,115, or 26.62 per cent, were Protestants; 
1,287, or 0.43 per cent, were Hebrew; 173, or 0.06 per cent, were of 
other creeds. 
During the preceding year the total number was 304,227, hence a 
decrease of 6,982 in one year which the official reports do not attempt 
to explain. 
IIl.—DISMISSALS BEFORE COMPLETING THE COURSE, 
On account of peculiar conditions provided for in the Bavarian 
law of compulsory elementary education, the following number were 
dismissed by way of dispensation before completing the course: 762, 
or 0.093 per cent, day-school pupils; 109, or 0.036 per cent, Sunday- 
school pupils; 48, or 0.006 per cent, day-school pupils in the cities; 
714, or 0.087 per cent, day-school pupils in the country; 19, or 0.006 
per cent, Sunday-school pupils in the cities; 90, or 0,030 per cent, 
Sunday-school pupils in the country. 
IV.—EXPENDITURES FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
The total amount of expenditures for elementary schools, both day 
and Sunday schools, in so far as they include appropriations on the 
part of communities and the State in 1893-94, was 18,070,708 marks,
-P-A-G-E-256
176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
or $4,300,828, to which should be added the tuition fees mentioned 
before, to wit, $384,469; grand total, $4,685,297. Taking both day and 
Sunday school pupils together (namely, 1,016,810), we find the 
expense per capita of the school population to be $4.60. If the Sun- 
day-school pupils are excluded from this calculation, which may 
properly be done since they are taught by the teachers of the day 
schools, the per capita expense would be $5.95. The per capita 
expense of the population was a little less than $1. 
The salaries claimed 56.9 per cent of the total expenditure, while 
new buildings, heating and lighting, and other repairs claimed 43.1 
per cent. The expenditures other than for salaries are specified as 
follows: 44.2 per cent for new buildings, 13 per cent for repairs, 17.8 
per cent for heating and lighting, 2.3 per cent for furniture, 3.9 per 
cent for apparatus and devices for teaching, 18.8 per cent for other 
school purposes. 
V.—SALARIES OF TEACHERS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
  The total income of all elementary teachers in Bavaria in 1893-94 
was 18,354,719 marks, or $436,842. This amount was distributed as 
follows: 97.5 per cent to the regular teachers, to wit, 85.2 per cent to 
class teachers, 8.7 per cent to principals, 6.1 per cent to assistants, 
2.5 per cent to religious and special teachers, 2.5 per cent to inspectors. 
The official report from which these data are taken states, also, the 
sources of the teachers’ income, to wit, 54.1 per cent from municipal 
or district taxes and funds, 10.2 per cent from provincial funds, 25.1 
per cent from State funds, 5.6 per cent from the church for services 
performed as organist and sexton, 5 per cent for services as secretary 
of the town council or other services. 
The sources of income of religious teachers are: 95.7 per cent from 
municipal and district taxes, 4.3 per cent from provincial funds, while 
no State funds are used for this purpose. 
B,—ContTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
In Germany the term ‘‘continuation schools” is used for day 
schools, evening, and Sunday schools in which children over 14 years 
are taught for the purpose of securing the results of elementary school 
work and to prepare boys somewhat for future occupations; hence 
they are variously called simple continuation schools, industrial con- 
tinuation schools, and agricultural continuation schools. In some 
parts of the country the town authorities make attendance at such 
schools compulsory between the fourteenth and eighteenth year of life. 
Bavaria had, during the year 1893-94, as many as 257 industrial con- 
tinuation-schools (in 1892-93, 253). Of these schools, 208 were inde- 
pendent and 49 were connected with high schools without Latin. In 
169 schools of this kind the attendance was obligatory by municipal 
statute.
-P-A-G-E-257
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 177 
The number of pupils at industrial continuation schools amounted 
to 32,286 (in 1892-93, 31,321), of which 578, or 1.79 per cent, attend 
day courses, and 31,708, or 98.2 per cent, the night and Sunday courses. 
Of the pupils of the last-mentioned courses 23,597, or 68.26 per cent, 
are taught in the elementary division, and 10,971, or 31.74 per cent, in 
the industrial or special classes. It will be noticed that the two num- 
bers added together are greater than the sum total of pupils. This 
isowing to the fact that many pupils are in both elementary and special 
classes. 
The number of teachers in these industrial schools was 1,647 (in the 
previous year, 1,592); 64, or 3.89 per cent, of these were employed exclu- 
sively for elementary work. The total amount expended was 602,434 
marks, or $137,379, of which sum 75.84 per cent was used to pay 
teachers’ salaries. 
The number of agricultural continuation schools was 447, among 
which were 12, or 2.68 per cent, kept open only in winter. The num- 
ber of pupils in these schools was 8,280 (in 1892-93, 9,022). Of these, 
536, or 6.47 per cent, attended the winter schools. Seven hundred 
teachers were employed in agricultural continuation schools, of whom 
only 6 were not also engaged in teaching elementary schools. 
The total amount expended for agricultural continuation schools 
was 160,779 marks, or $38,265, of which sum 57 per cent was used to 
pay teachers’ salaries. 
There is still another kind of continuation schools in Bavaria, 
to wit, forestry schools. In 1893-94 Bavaria had 5 institutions of this 
kind, with 252 pupils and 24 teachers. Tuition and matriculation 
fees in these schools amounted to 5,119 marks, or $1,218, while the 
expenses were 32,198 marks, or $7,663. Ten of the teachers were expert 
foresters.

EXTRACTS FROM AN ESSAY ENTITLED “‘THE LATEST MOVEMENTS IN 
EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.” 
In a discussion in the ‘‘ Zeitschrift fiir auslindisches Unterrichts- 
wesen” on this subject Dr. Schlee, who was a member of the famous 
December conference in Berlin, called by Emperor William for the 
purpose of simplifying the courses of study in secondary schools, and 
who visited the United States during the Columbian Exposition, 
makes some pointed remarks concerning the reports of the committee 
of ten and the committee of fifteen appointed by the National Educa- 
tion Association. 
After a thorough review of the work of the committee of ten and 
its subcommittees, he closes with these words: 
The fundamental points which the committee of ten recognizes as 
fixed are (1) that the number of lessons per week be not increased, 
(2) that the conditions of admission to college be not increased, and 
(3) that the principle of unity upon which the common school rests be 
not disturbed. This last-mentioned point meets all demands for a 
differentiation or bifurcation previous to the eighth year of the course. 
In other words, that the pupils intending to enter college and those
-P-A-G-E-259
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. aD) 
  intending to devote themselves to business pursuits should have pre- 
cisely the same elementary instruction. Yet the committee declares 
it impossible to prepare a suitable programme for the secondary school 
haying a course of four years if it be built on the present course of 
the common school. Either instruction in foreign languages, mathe- 
matics, and natural sciences should begin in the elementary school or 
the secondary school should begin two years earlier, and leave only 
six years for the elementary school. It is claimed that elementary 
instruction, both with regard to matter and method, is continued too 
long. In all the sub or special committees the complaint was heard 
that the high school did not find sufficient preparatory knowledge in 
the pupils, and that it had to begin with all secondary branches at the 
same time. 
Of all claims for an earlier beginning of secondary branches none 
was more emphatic than that for foreign languages. The valuation 
of modern foreign languages is naturally different in America from 
the European, for the American does not recognize the need of them 
as languages of communication. Still, knowledge of foreign lan- 
guages is considered by him of great value for the training of the mind, j 
especially for a more thorough comprehension of the mother tongue, : 
although this is not attributed to the power of a special formative 
and logical training as it was formerly in relation to Latin grammar. 
On the other hand, the comprehension of the German language is 
acknowledged as a means to a recognition of German science. While 
the committee in its general discussion emphasized more the pedagog- 
ical gain arising from the study of foreign tongues, in the details of its 
plan of study it points to this more practical aim.. The report does 
not arrive at a complete equalization of these different aims. 
The committee goes farthest in its recommendations concerning 
modern Janguages, the chairman designating this as most novel and 
striking. They are, that German or French be introduced as a regu- 
lar study in the fifth school year, tenth year of age. The report adds 
that Latin would offer the same advantages, but living languages 
seemed more suitable for grammar schools, as the upper grades of the 
common schools are called. 
The subcommittee on Latin considers it desirable to increase the 
demands in that study and regrets the fact that the study of Latin is 
commenced at a much earlier date in England, France, and Germany 
as compared with America. Still the committee thinks it undesirable 
tomake a radical change, and is satisfied with the suggestion of begin- 
ning Latin one year earlier, devoting to it five hours per week. The 
committee on mathematics likewise advocates earlier occupation with 
geometry, and so, too, the committee on natural sciences claims sev- 
eral years for instruction in simple natural phenomena, in botany, 
zoology; and again, the committee on history calls for two years of 
study in history, American and universal history. 
The question arises whether all these proposals can be united within 
the limits of the common school system. Doubtless some changes 
might be introduced in the grammar school easily without doing vio- 
lence to its character as a common school. For instance, concrete 
geometry may be added to mathematics; that is, the introduction to 
the study of geometry by means of the senses and with the aid of 
drawing, measuring, without formal proof. Instruction in natural 
sciences may also be limited to a discussion of important phenomena, 
animals, and plants. But the unity of the system becomes question- 
able when instruction in modern tongues as an optional branch is 
introduced; still more by the introduction of Latin, ancient history, 
Sea eee
-P-A-G-E-260
   
   180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
    and algebra as optional branches. These subjects should become 
compulsory branches during the last year’s course of the elementary 
school. It is true ancient history does not seem as necessary for the 
Americans as it is for the Germans, because they have no history of 
the Middle Ages of their own, although their language and literature 
have borrowed much more from antiquity than we have. Consider 
the many antique proper names in America, as for instance, Athens, 
Sparta, Ithaca, Cincinnati, Capitol, ete. A connected history of classic 
antiquity is not related to the general culture of the people, and 
receives its value only in connection with higher education. And 
yet there is a proposition to teach Latin one or possibly two years in 
the elementary school. The subcommittee for instruction in Latin 
and the entire committee of ten leave this point somewhat unexplained 
and merely propose an earlier beginning, while at the same time 
offering suggestions tending to make the former nonactive. 
In contradistinction, the committee of fifteen takes up Latin, with 
five lessons per week during the last school year of the course of the 
elementary school, and at the same time definitely adheres to the prin- 
ciple that the instruction for boys and girls should be precisely the 
same to the fourteenth year of age. This committee expects much 
from these weak beginnings in Latin, which are not continued, as it 
also does of algebra. Quite contrary to the sometimes excessive 
demand, heard in Germany also, for a definite conclusion and finish 
of the elementary education, the committee is of the opinion that a 
brief instruction in secondary subjects, like Latin and algebra, has a 
higher value than any elementary branch that might be substituted 
for them. Especially a year’s instruction in Latin would place a 
pupil far above those who only studied English grammar, without 
Latin, for the beginning of any branch (discipline) lays special weight 
upon its fundamental ideas. During the first week of Latin lessons, 
the pupil is made acquainted with the remarkable phenomenon that 
a language can express by declensions and conjugations what his 
mother tongue does by means of prepositions and auxiliaries (English: 
to him, Latin: ei). He learns with astonishment that quite a dif- 
ferent order of the words in syntax is to be followed, and that root 
words have still a concrete meaning, while the same words or their 
derivations in the mother tongue are abstract. These observations 
are mental germs, which grow and result in a better mastering of the 
mother tongue. Similarly the result of studying the elements of alge- 
bra are judged. For a young philosopher this might be found true, 
but for the majority of elementary pupils they are imaginings devoid 
of substance. 
In this question we may see the pivotal point of the whole present 
educational movement in America. The weakness of secondary edu- 
cation is correctly recognized. The attempt ought to be made to 
begin earlier with foreign languages and mathematics, but any 
attempt to fit this plan for the entire common school, which naturally 
finds much opposition in America, must miscarry. Moreover, since 
the grammar school in the South and everywhere in rural districts 
closes with the sixth school year, America will have to follow the 
example of all other civilized countries and allow the high school and 
the elementary school to go side by side for a number of years. The 
propositions of the committee of fifteen, compared with those of the 
committee of ten, appear to us as a step backward. 
* * * * * * * 
With reference to the organic connection between the high school,  
-P-A-G-E-261
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 181 
  college, and university, the committee of ten entertains the opinion, 
based upon actual conditions, that the course of study should be 
arranged essentially for those boys and girls who do not intend to 
continue their studies in a higher seat of learning; that is to say, 
those who do not intend to enter the college, and that a preparation 
for higher education could only be a secondary object of the high 
school. But starting from the theoretic presupposition that the 
chief branches, if treated thoroughly, are, as regards their formative 
power, of equal value for admission to college, the committee con- 
siders it right that the colleges make special conditions regarding the 
extent and duration of school studies and require proofs as the com- 
mittee on English, for instance, does by demanding that no pupil be 
admitted to college who can not write good English. But on the whole 
the committee seems to favor the suggestion that a satisfactory grad- 
uation from a four years’ course be considered a suitable preparation 
for college or any other scientific institution. In other words, that 
the examination for graduation in the high school do away with an 
examination for admission to college; and the committee considers 
this profitable for the schools, colleges, and the entire country. 
The subcommittees of the committee of ten express themselves in 
detail concerning the method of instruction. Their reports show that 
pedagogical theory in the United States is everywhere abreast with 
the present status of science, and that it is very familiar with German 
pedagogy and psychology from Pestalozzi to Wundt. Although the 
statements do not bear the character of borrowed thought, but appear 
to have been thought out independently, still special portions bear a 
very familiar face; thus, for instance, when the committee on his- 
tory speaks of political economy (Volkswirtschaftslehre). There is 
not another question in which the persons consulted show a greater 
variety of opinion. Some distinguished superintendents and princi- 
pals wish to have this branch taught during the last year of the high 
school course; some even demand daily instruction for twelve weeks; 
other teachers declare that there is no place for that branch in the 
secondary school. Under the cireumstances the committee thought 
it wise not to recommend formal instruction in political economy, but 
that the most important principles be presented in connection with the 
history of the United States and commercial geography. The subject 
would therefore appear first in its most elementary features during 
the third year of the grammar school, and then again during the last 
two years of the high school. It would appear not as a special science, 
but as an explanation of conditions of the commonwealth and of 
political questions. 
Observe this passage concerning the mother tongue: ‘‘ Both with 
reference to the high school and the lower schools, the committees 
declare that every teacher, in whatever branch he may instruct, must 
consider himself responsible for the use of good English on the part of 
his pupils.” Similar to the committee on natural science, the com- 
mittee on history emphasizes the necessity of written accounts, narra- 
tions, and other compositions; and if the propositions of the nine 
committees become realities there would be at least one written com- 
position daily for every pupil, which, in the interest of good English, 
is important. 
In the face of the method of instruction in vogue in America it is 
particularly remarkable that all these committees consider the acqui- 
sition of mere knowledge not the aim of education, but the develop- 
ment of the mental powers and comprehension, exercises in observing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
    182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
developing thought and expression. For this reason the various 
committees intend to limit the use of the text-book method and 
recommend its exclusion from grammar schools in studies like gram- 
mar, mathematics, and natural sciences. This method may be 
explained as follows: The text-book or guide is first studied, i. e., 
memorized by the pupil, mostly in school in so-called study lessons, 
and then the teacher asks for the contents of the lesson during reci- 
tations. While this reciting is going on he explains, corrects, and 
enlarges the matter as occasion demands. The committee of fifteen 
(whose report on method of instruction, written by Dr. Harris, takes 
its stand more on the solid ground of existing circumstances, not merely 
from necessity, but also from appreciation of these circumstances) 
gives special instruction for the treatment of this method, and 
recommends, for instance, the dividing each class into two divisions, 
so that the one study (memorize) while the other recite. The com- 
mittee of ten, however, and especially its subcommittees, make oral 
lessons—that is, free instruction by the teacher—everywhere the prin- 
cipal thing. They wish that the teacher lead the child to observe 
and to start from observation and experience. In the interest of 
geography and natural sciences they recommend that one after- - 
noon per week be utilized for excursions into the open air, and they 
suggest the utilization of the free Saturdays for exercise in nat- 
ural-science laboratories. They further recommend more extensive 
equipment of the schools with means of instruction, more drawing 
wherever possible, and not merely means of demonstration for the 
teacher, but also means for the exercise of the pupils. Special sub- 
committees present a methodical order of experiments, 57 for the 
instruction in physics and 100 for chemistry. 
However, for all this teachers are necessary, and these are found 
in few schools. The committee of ten, and almost all its subcommit- 
tees, point to this great want and make recommendations for the prep- 
aration of suitable teachers. The committee on geography, which 
furnished the most extensive report, recommends a course very much 
in harmony with the new Herbartians (for instance, Frick), namely, 
to make geography a central branch and not to restrict it to a mere 
description of the surface of the earth, but include in it the elements 
of botany, zoology, astronomy, and meteorology, with all sorts of dis- 
cussions concerning commerce, politics, ethnology, etc., and this com- 
mission submits a course like the one treated with us only in its first 
beginnings (compare W. Zopf, ‘‘The sum total of instruction in nat- 
ural sciences for Prussian secondary schools of both kinds, Breslau, 
1887”). The committee of ten designates these propositions as revo- 
lutionary, although as an ideal course which it is impossible to carry 
out everywhere and immediately. 
We give about the same criticism to the reports concerning instruc- 
tion in the sciences, including history. Some of the propositions 
betray that they are put forward by academic professors whose judg- 
ment is not guided by pedagogical experience; for instance, when we 
see that for botanical instruction in the elementary school it is pro- 
posed to furnish every pupil with at least a microscope, alcohol, gly- 
cerin, and iodine to aid his investigations of plants; or when we see the 
pupils of the senior high school class instructed to judge the author- 
ity of sources, especially the difference between real sources and rep- 
resentations at second hand; or when it is seriously recommended to 
allow the pupils of the same class in history to use two, three, or four 
parallel text-books for the purpose of accustoming them to comparison 
and criticism.
-P-A-G-E-263
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 183 
  However, these little things do not detract from the value of the 
whole. The report of the committee of ten has for America the im- 
portance of an official pedagogy, scientifically progressive and profes- 
sional, which will exercise an important influence upon the American 
school for a number of years. 
And now to the committee of fifteen. For the purpose of continu- 
ing its reform propositions, the National Education Association in 
1894 appointed another commission, this time of fifteen men, who 
should solve the same problem for the elementary school, and sketch 
the principles of municipal school management, and make suggestions 
for professional preparation of teachers. To facilitate the work, this 
commission was divided into three sections, each of five members. 
Following the example of the committee of ten, they put themselves 
in communication with all parts of the country by submitting a num- 
ber of questions to many learned men and educators, and calling for 
expressions of opinion. 
It is not necessary to enter into the reports on the two subjects men- 
tioned last, however important they may be for America, since they 
are closely connected with public institutions differing from ours. It 
may be remarked though that the proposals for school management 
intend to serve reform by making the municipal school commissions 
independent of political influence by means of appointment instead 
of election. This will increase the independence and responsibility 
of the school superintendent. The last question, the one concerning 
preparation of teachers, is perhaps the most urgent one in the United 
States, but its solution finds the greatest difficulties in the prevailing 
social conditions, which will wreck the suggestions, however logical 
they may be. They are, that the general education of teachers, male 
and female, should be four years in advance of the course of the school 
in which they instruct; hence that elementary teachers should have 
graduated from the high school, and teachers of secondary schools 
have passed through college; besides, that both should have pursued 
a partly theoretical and partly practical course of pedagogy in a 
normal school. 
More important by far is the first of the three problems, and the 
report concerning it has all the more interest to us, inasmuch as it is 
eomposed- by Dr. Harris, the present Commissioner of Education. 
We have touched upon the report in previous pages. 
Its peculiar importance may be found in the fact that it has caused 
a commotion in the educational world of America such as has never 
been witnessed before. The department of school superintendence 
had proposed the subject, ‘‘Correlation of studies in elementary 
schools.” This term is of doubtful meaning—at any rate, its meaning 
is disputed in America—more so than with us the term ‘“‘concentra- 
tion in instruction,” a term that is used with more different interpre- 
tations by our new Herbartians (Ziller, Stoy, Kern, Dillmann, Frick) 
than by Herbart himself, who meant it to be a connection of the entire 
instruction for systematic training of the soul of the pupil. In the 
department of superintendence, however (as is seen from the meeting 
of the department at Cleveland, February 19 to 21, 1895), it seemed to 
have been the intention to call for a report upon the different kinds 
of concentration and a general application of Herbartian principles to 
courses of study and methods of instruction. One is all the more 
induced to think so since not only the committee of ten, but also the 
subcommittees on history, geography, and natural sciences had ex- 
pressed themselves quite in the sense of the new Herbartian school,
-P-A-G-E-264
  184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
and had especially suggested a combination of related branches in 
instruction. They had not only used the expression ‘‘ association,” 
which was plain enough, but had also used the word ‘“‘correlation.” 
We quote from page 16: ‘‘ While these nine conferences desire each 
their own subject to be brought into the course of elementary schools, 
they all agree that these different subjects should be correlated and 
associated one with another by the programme and by actual teach- 
ing; that every subject recommended for introduction into elementary 
and secondary schools should help every other, and that the teacher 
of each single subject should feel responsible for the advancement of 
the pupils in all subjects, and should distinctly contribute to this 
advancement.” The report was expected to solve the same problem 
which Frick had attempted to solve in the meeting of principals of the 
Province of Saxony in the year 1883. 
But Dr. Harris, on the whole, belongs to a conservative class of 
men. His scientific leaning is not so much toward the natural-scien- 
tific as it is toward the historic-philologic direction. The analysis of 
definitions forms with him the starting point of investigation, and in 
the development of his course for the elementary school he does not 
hesitate to go back to Charlemagne’s trivium and quadrivium. He 
can not be counted among the representatives of the grammatical 
specialists, since he knows how to value a correct realistic instruction 
and does not try to make grammar a favorite factor in the so-called 
formal training. Yet he stands on the philologie side of the question, 
and regards language as the center of instruction in elementary 
schools. He may have been induced to emphasize this more particu- 
larly, since in public education in America the interest in natural 
sciences predominates, which may be seen from the fact that the 
pedagogical influence of Preyer finds much applause. We may also 
add that Dr. Harris is a Hegelian and, particularly in psychology, 
an opponent of Herbart. Finally, a misunderstanding added to the 
agitation, for he did not use the term ‘‘correlation of studies” in the 
sense in which it was used in the questions submitted. In short, he 
did not, as was expected by a number of educators, furnish an essay 
eoncerning the proper relation of branches in the course of study. 
In his fine and well-weighed manner he enters upon the order in which 
the branches should enter the course in harmony with the develop- 
ment of the pupil. He then explains more particularly what Stoy 
designates as ‘‘staties of instruction;” that is to say, the selection 
and amount which would promote an all-sided harmonious develop- 
ment of the mental powers and interests, and how a course of study 
should be framed to introduce the pupil into the totality of human 
knowledge of the present day, and prepare him for the practical 
demands of the world in which he is to live. 
However well this may have been thought out, there is much abstract 
deduction without actuality in it. The kind of correlation of studies 
which many had thought of he merely touches by characterizing and 
rejecting the artificial combination of instruction in “‘Gesinnungs- und 
Kulturstufenstoff,” rejected by the American Herbartians, as is done 
by our modern Herbartians in Germany, and he did it in referring to 
Ziller’s example of Robinson Crusoe. To combat the perversity of 
artificial concentration was wise and proper, especially the mixing up 
of the branches of study, which is found in Germany here and there 
trumped up in model lessons in which essentials are torn apart and 
thrown aside in, order to make excursions into other fields. But Dr. 
Harris not only neglected to point out the correct method of associa-

    tion and concentration, but also failed to show the establishment of 
centers and unities within each branch of study by means of selection 
and grouping; nor did he touch upon the assistance of the various 
branches to one another by means of suitable reading matter and 
drawing; nor did he suggest a method of comprehensive relation of 
knowledge, but he provoked his opponents by placing his views, which 
are correct enough, to be sure, in direct contradistinction to the 
endeavors of the Herbartians. In place of concentration he advocated, 
especially for the beginning of instruction, the principle of analysis 
and isolation, so that everything individual and characteristic found 
in any branch of study should be clearly comprehended and become 
effective. While on the other side, in exaggeration of a correct idea, 
the study of the child’s soul is made the basis of the whole science of 
pedagogy, Harris emphasizes sharply that it is not the psychology and 
the physiology of brain cells which determine the kind and extent of 
the branches taught, but the demands of the civilization in which the 
child is born, so that it be enabled to perform its duties in the family, 
in civil society, in state, and church. The method of instruction is to 
him a secondary consideration, and for external matters each science 
will suggest its own directions. 
The consequence was that after the report was read in Cleveland 
February 19 to 21, 1895, the debate disclosed an almost universal 
and violent opposition. However, the study of educational questions, 
especially the Herbartian pedagogy in America, has received a stronger 
impetus than it would have received if the report had represented 
Herbart’s views. According to information received from an Ameri- 
can educator, there have never been such animated discussions in the 
educational world in America as at present. The United States, it is 
said, resembles a hotbed of pedagogical discussion, over which the 
gods must rejoice. 
A GERMAN VIEW OF THE REPORT OF THE ENGLISH ROYAL COMMIS- 
SION ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Education of 1894-95 
and 1895-96 contained full accounts of the report of the English Royal 
Commission on secondary education, and quoted numerous noted 
English writers in reference to its origin and effect. The document 
proved of sufficient importance to arouse the attention of educators 
in both hemispheres, and it is instructive to see how this result of a 
thorough investigation, both in England and its colonies, and on the 
European continent, as wellas in the United States, is reflected in the 
minds of German educators. The ‘‘ Deutsche Zeitschrift fiir Auslin- 
disches Unterrichtswesen” (a quarterly published in Leipzig and ed- 
ited by Dr. J. Wychgram) contained in the second number of 1897 
an authoritative German expression of opinion, which evidently views 
the English effort at reforming secondary education very impartially, 
yet critically. An English version of this article is offered here, with 
the hope that it may contribute to the comprehension of the report 
of the Royal Commission, and to gain an insight into the principles 
underlying governmental action in behalf of secondary schools in the

     two countries, Germany and England. In some parts of this article 
it may be useful to refer to previous publications in the Annual Reports 
of the Commissioner of Education. (See pp. 583 to 713 of vol. 1, 
1894-95.) 
Dr. Otto W. Beyer, in the article mentioned, treats the famous 
document of nine volumes as a whole, and dwells preferably upon 
the underlying principles. He writes as follows: 
The report of the commission on secondary education in England is 
undoubtedly one of the most, if not the most, important documents 
relative to school questions that have been published within the last 
decade of the development of secondary education in England. In 
eases of important issues it is a favorite mode of procedure of the 
English nation to appoint Parliamentary commissions for the inyesti- 
gation of far-reaching and particularly difficult subjects, and to 
endow them with unlimited power of requisition, so that the bare fact 
of presenting to the public a detailed report in nine volumes on sec- 
ondary education in England is significant of English conditions. 
Germany has nothing to offer in comparison. Without reflection, 
the report on the conference convoked by the Emperor in Berlin, 
December, 1890, might be suggested, but this publication can be only 
distantly compared to the English. From the outset the purpose 
defined was more limited and much less uninfluenced than that of 
the royal commission of England. The method of procedure and the 
membership were also entirely different; and in reality the German 
report lacks just those supplements which make the English report so 
valuable, to wit, the views in form of written opinions, and the 
stenographie accounts of testimony of every class of the public con- 
versant with the subject, and the critical judgment passed on these 
opinions by the commission. 
It is not our intention to offer a criticism on the value of the German 
report; we wish merely to state the fact that in Germany there exists 
no similar educational document. It is evident that Germans do not 
lay the same stress as the English do on public opinion, at least in 
matters pertaining to the learned professions. Whoever followed the 
important newspapers of England from the fall of 1895 till late in the 
following spring, during which time the battle of voluntary and board 
schools raged, will remember how contributions on this question 
poured in thick and fast, day by day, and will understand how the 
English Government would have ignored popular opinion had it over- 
looked the movements of public interest. In the discussion on the 
conditions of secondary education the Government may have felt the 
necessity of extra cireumspection because of the important questions 
of material welfare at stake, and at the same time because of the close 
connection of these questions with the sympathies and antipathies of 
great and influential classes and with the weal or woe of numerous 
honorable institutions. In the present case the opinion of all parties 
concerned was greatly to be desired. 
These facts were kept in view in forming the commission and when 
investing it with powers. The commission consisted of 17 members— 
learned professors, high ecclesiastics, Government officials, members 
of Parliament, representatives of university extension, and others, 
including three women, of whom two had received a doctor’s degree at 
English universities. Consequently, the best educated and thoroughly 
impartial laity were commissioned with the investigation. The powers
-P-A-G-E-267
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 187 
  granted by the Queen were unlimited. The commission was empow- 
ered to interview experts, examine books, documents, registers, reports, 
ete., and to adopt any other lawful means which it might deem service- 
able to obtain a view of the state of affairs. Its field of investigation 
was secondary education in the broadest sense of the term—all author- 
ities, central as well as local, occupied with education; all kinds of 
high schools, among them many on the border line between elemen- 
tary and secondary schools; all kinds of teachers of high schools and 
their conditions; all kinds of school buildings, and, finally, all kinds 
of resources and their application. The report was laid before Par- 
liament, which gave it the greatest possible publicity. The com- 
mission accomplished its work in 17 months, or 105 sessions. Many 
specialists were consulted, and when necessary auxiliary commissions, 
or subcommittees, were formed, consisting of both men and women. 
The first of the nine volumes gives an account of the issues; it formed 
the basis for the statement of contents of the whole work. Thesecond, 
third, and fourth volumes contain a verbatim report of the many 
opinions expressed on the different questions; the fifth volume con- 
tains notes of different specialists, as well as written answers to ques- 
tions directed to individuals or corporations. Information is also given 
on secondary education abroad, as in the English colonies of Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, in the United States of 
America, in Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Bavaria, Hessia, 
Prussia, Saxony, Saxe-Weimar, Wiirtemberg, Holland, Spain, Sweden, 
Norway, and Switzerland. The sixth and seventh volumes contain 
the reports of the auxiliary commissions on the systems of secondary 
education in America and on conditions in countries which were 
regarded by the commission as typical of the development of secondary 
education in England. The eighth volume contains the summary and 
index of all the opinions of specialists, while the ninth volume closes 
the work with a large number of statistical tables. 
Considering the report as a whole, we are at once confronted by the 
pleasing fact of the fund of common sense at the bottom. It is mani- 
festly a very carefully prepared extract from all experiences and 
desires accumulated during the course of generations in widely 
different places under the most diversified conditions and under the 
greatest variety of influences. Its reflections are founded upon a 
manifold reality showing much individual life attended with great 
irregularity. On this broad foundation it certainly attempts—proba- 
bly with too great care—to deduct generalities by a purely inductive 
method. Thus the report is also remarkable as being a typical 
evidence of the purely inductive English, we might say Baconian, 
mind resting firmly on a basis of a modest realism. 
The Germans incline more to being deductive; but though it is our 
original title to fame and our strength and our pride in science, it may 
be questioned whether this marked tendency toward deductive reason- 
ing may not have had too strong a theoretic influence on our school sys- 
tems. The feeling that such is the case is widely spread in Germany, 
and was experienced by the Emperor when he convoked the confer- 
ence in Berlin, December, 1890. As Brandi has rightly said in the 
Prussian Yearbooks (vol. 84, No. 2, p. 270), the first question with 
Germans is, ‘‘ What do we want?” With the Englishmenit is, ‘‘What 
can we do?” We define our aim by what seems best; the English 
define theirs by what is attainable. The question is whether we, in 
determining what ‘“‘seems” best, sufficiently consider the manifold 
and various conditions of practical life and their influence on school
-P-A-G-E-268
188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  education. The reserve of the English report gives us food for 
thought in this direction; the fact is repeatedly emphasized that few 
general rules should be laid down, as there is constant danger of treat- 
ing too theoretically different necessities and entirely different degrees 
of capacity. ‘“‘Uniformity” and ‘‘systems” of education the com- 
mission would abandon, displacing them under all circumstances by 
freedom, diversity, and expansiveness, advantages which have so 
often counterbalanced its deficiencies. For this reason the English 
are so patient with the multitudinous distinct forms of their educa- 
tional system which are at times so difficult for us to understand. 
Up to a certain point it is believed that whatever exists is justified. 
But the commission is not blind to the deficiencies of the English 
system of education. The chief evil of a lack of ‘‘ coherence” and 
“correlation” in administration is properly appreciated; it could 
hardly fail to exist among four central authorities. The report men- 
tions as a probable case that large sums of money may have been 
expended on buildings or other appurtenances which, if not altogether 
superfluous, have nevertheless not been sufficiently considered, or have 
been planned with respect to certain districts only, or to special pur- 
poses, whereas others should have received similar consideration. 
Besides, many plans generally conceded to be excellent could not be 
carried out, because of the uncertainty of receiving the money appro- 
priated for the purpose by the law of 1890. The report emphasizes 
the immediate necessity of bringing abouta change by means of legis- 
lation and the privy council. A special form of deficiency is the so- 
called overlapping of school districts, boundaries, and authorities. 
Further fault is found in the misappropriation of endowments. It 
is to be distinctly understood that the newly to be appointed local 
school authorities are to be empowered with the regulation of spend- 
ing endowment funds, and that their action is to be supported by the 
Government, even if old endowment statutes are violated in the inter- 
est of schools. As to what concerns the internal conditions of schools, 
it was found that pupils are kept in a state of dullnessand indolence; 
the consequence is that as adults they do not seek to satisfy their 
desire for pleasure in the noblest way. The senseless so-called cram- 
ming for examinations is also deplored, as well the frequency of exam- 
inations, and the evil that hitherto one examining board seldom 
acknowledged the merits of the work of another. The commission 
maintains that there should be uniform examinations for the whole 
country. It has been found to be cnly too true that many schools do 
not accomplish proper results, and that many teachers are poor educa- 
tors. The proposed means of reformation will be given later on. 
On the other hand the merits of the English educational system 
receive due recognition. First among these are the wealth and mul- 
tiplicity of individual forms of schools and the voluntary powers zeal- 
ously devoted to secondary education. To avoid future interference 
with the multiplicity of distinct forms the commission does not favor 
laying down general rules for the establishment of secondary schools. 
It thinks that it should remain or become the duty of local school 
authorities to provide such schools in every district, as in conformity 
with public opinion, best meet local needs. For the same reason there 
should be no specified curriculum of study for the different types of 
schools. 
The evidences of action among voluntary powers in behalf of sec- 
ondary education are found in the existence of a large number of 
societies, independent of the State, which make a point of founding
-P-A-G-E-269
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL. EUROPE. 189 
and supporting schools. It is a great act of self-reliance to exert per- 
sonal effort where there are no endowed schools. Some of these soci- 
eties are stock companies, institutions for educational purposes little 
known in Germany. The large, even imposing, endowment funds, so 
frequent in England, are signs of the great interest manifested in the 
education of youth beyond the elementary stage. Such endowments 
for educational purposes are much more numerous in England than in 
Germany, but we must not forget that we, suffering from the effects 
of the thirty years’ war, are not so rich a nation as the English, which 
was drawing in wealth from its colonies while our country was rent 
with the bloodiest and most disastrous war in the annals of history. 
The industrial development of England, moreover, began several gen- 
erations earlier than ours, and private assistance had more occasion 
to extend a helping hand, as the State did nothing for education. The 
social evils of large cities also attained a higher degree of threatening 
danger much sooner than with us, and better education was regarded 
as a reformacory means. Many facts goto prove that in England the 
spirit of self-reliance is much older than with us—a consequence of 
the extended local self-government which England has enjoyed for 
many centuries. England is preeminently the country of social 
customs. 
Further evidences of voluntary action are seen in university exten- 
sion which, supported by the influence of the two ancient and rich 
universities of Cambridge and Oxford, for a long time developed 
without any State assistance. Very recently the Government has 
allowed appropriations for this enterprise. The whole movement 
plays an important part in England. The memoranda of the com- 
mission contains various entries respecting it. Even the two! inde- 
pendent institutes which the movement called to life, i. e., the uni- 
- versity-extension colleges at Reading and Exeter, were called upon 
by the commission to furnish their data. 
Another result of independent action is the establishment of a sys- 
tem of examinations for secondary schools without intervention from 
the State. Universities arranged examinations for preparatory and 
other secondary schools, originally out of necessity, because they had 
suffered the unpleasant experience of a constantly deteriorating pre- 
paratory education. The result of these private efforts has been that 
advanced education is controlled by the universities, a condition 
generally appreciated. 
Compulsory attendance is not an immediate effect of State influ- 
ence. School boards received permission from the Government to 
require compulsory attendance in their districts as they saw fit. 
Neither is school inspection founded upon State laws; it was intro- 
duced solely by ordinance. 
As in weighing the merits and faults the commission showed a 
remarkable absence of prejudice, so a wise diplomacy is manifested 
in the measures they propose. Its uniform good will toward all sec- 
ondary education is a mark of wise policy. Its earnest aspiration is 
to liberate the latent intellectual powers of youth, and to remove as 
many as possible of the obstacles in the way of their development. 
Necessarily the notable fact must have had influence that the univer- 
sal competition threatening England in the field of industry, in which 
until recently it was the leader, makes a better appreciation of these 
powers a stern duty. i 
1More recently a third has been established.

      190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
   Extraordinary caution is displayed in all proposed reforms, and 
great care is taken not to infringe upon time-honored principles of 
local self-government. The State is advised not to interfere when 
State interference is not positively necessary. The opinion held by 
the commission is that this principle has made the English great as a 
nation, and should be preserved. At the same time it is justified in 
apprehending that a contrary attitude of the Government would excite 
the people to too great anextent. In point of fact, nowhere outside of 
England has the controversy over the claims of State opinion against 
the rights of the individual (in itself the problem of all political devel- 
opment) been carried on with such tenacity of purpose and such 
whole-souled participation on the part of the individual. For this 
reason the commission considers it of paramount importance to 
combine the greatest simplicity with the least possible disturbance of 
exciting conditions. Therefore, it maintains that interference of 
authorities in general is permissible only to preserve present privi- 
leges and in cases of appropriations of public money, and possibly, 
also, inspection of sanitary conditions. 
In pursuance of these opinions there is a given instance that where 
it is so desired private schools may refuse to submit to any State 
inspection except that of sanitary conditions. Even though the power 
of the State be unquestioned, a misuse of that power should be cau- 
tiously prevented. A highly estimable sense of justice is manifested 
in the report in the measures suggested against force employed to 
coerce minorities or individuals. The forbearance which the docu- 
ment recommends with inefficient private schools and poor teachers 
can be understood to proceed from a similar feeling. As a father does 
not willingly disown a wayward child, sothe State should not relinquish 
the hope that inferior schools and incompetent teachers may improve 
by the example of their betters. Again, the commission shrinks from 
an attack on personal liberty. The creation of a monopoly for public 
schools by suppressing private schools is considered a step that might 
retard the progress of education. The duty of the law to educate the 
people is considered of higher importance than the immediate lessen- 
ing of existing evils which, beyond a doubt, would vanish under 
stricter regulations against inefficient schools. 
The commission seems to have forgotten that the children suffer 
when the State countenances poor schools and inefficient teachers. 
A seeming good will toward adults thereby leads to an indisputable 
injustice to minors. But if wrong in that case, the commission is 
decidedly right in placing a high estimate on the duty of the Govern- 
ment to educate the people. This alone explains its desire to invest 
with great power the local authorities newly to be appointed. A sim- 
ilar experiment has already been tried in the educational system of 
England; the Government at least sanctioned the policy of investing 
great power in local authorities. The county councils established in 
1878, self-governing bodies originally vested with important judiciary 
power, but in nowise with special rights of school inspection, were 
allowed an annual appropriation of about $2,750,000 to be expended 
for the cause of technical education. The wide interpretation given 
by the law to the very term technical education enabled the councils 
to support not only technical education but a great part of secondary 
education in general. 
It is no wonder that a body whose members have been elected for 
entirely different purposes from the development of secondary educa- 
tion should, in the beginning, misspend money. In the end, the     
                                                                         
   
               
   
 
-P-A-G-E-271
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 191 
  experiment was rather a costly one; but so rich a country as England 
holds its own even under dearly bought experiences that always have 
something of an educational character. It is not unlikely that the 
increasing experience of the councils in matters of secondary educa- 
tion in the meantime made the investment pay. At least there pre- 
vails a constantly growing belief that county councils have rendered 
useful service in developing secondary education, and the measure 
proposed by the royal commission of allowing them to elect the new 
local boards substantiates this. Continuity of development, which 
this measure protects in a field that can least bear violent agitation, 
must be provided for by a wise and preeautionary government. It is 
not at ail impossible that these local boards which can look back 
upon experience gained under adverse conditions will one day be the 
pride of the English educational system. The commission has espe- 
cially prepared their berth with a tender love of preference. 
It is furthermore significant that local school boards have very 
extensive powers of supervision, but only mild means of compulsion. 
An educational aim is thereby kept in view; the judgment of a citi- 
zen is spurred on to a voluntary acceptance of such sacrifices as the 
law can exact. To excite a lively local interest local school boards 
are permitted to superintend all affairs relative to secondary edu- 
eation—teachers, pupils, resources, and conditions of the schools. 
Within the limits of the law they shall have sovereign control in 
their sphere of action; they shall found and organize schools, main- 
tain and supervise them; however, they must not directly oppose 
those to whom they owe their existence. They must act equally in 
contact with the central power and the people without any other 
intermediary whatever. The royal commission has intentionally left 
out of its recommendations the creation of an isolated provincial 
authority. Its opinion is that its functions should be divided between 
the central power and local authorities, and that a provincial authority 
would only occasion friction. 
This is a strictly decentralizing measure; in fact, the commission 
has made every effort possiblestoward decentralization, as it is of the 
opinion that the intervention of the state in secondary education 
should be very limited, much more so than with us in Germany. It 
is disinclined to place secondary education entirely under public con- 
trol, and considers the examinations and revisions prescribed for 
elementary education detrimental to secondary education. The com- 
mission is very skeptical respecting fixed courses of study; it looks 
for a remedy rather in the improvement of methods and a better 
preparation of teachers. In the present condition of normal schools, 
and with present methods of instruction in England, this is most apt 
to be the correct view. 
We have already seen with how much caution the commission pro- 
poses innovations. In all cases it endeavors to make the best use of 
existing conditions with the least possible disturbance, and retains 
whatever of present usage is to any degree justifiable. With a strong 
partiality for conservative methods, it recommends that no new taxes 
be imposed, but that present incomes be distributed in conformity 
with the English principle to make the best of a thing. It agrees 
with Matthew Arnold, that the resources of secondary schools in 
England are immense if judiciously divided and properly applied. 
Therefore it insists upon a revision of regulations for endowments; 
therefore it maintains that the statute governing any endowment 
fund should not become in force until forty years after its establish-
-P-A-G-E-272
| 
  192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
ment; therefore it proposes that statutes referring to the expenditures 
of endowments, the interest of which exceeds $500, should be sub- 
mitted to Parliament for approval; therefore it favors appropriate 
regulations for endowments in general. One of the main issues is 
that when any school has more income than it needs the tuition fee 
should not therefore be reduced for those students whose parents 
ean easily pay, but that the general plane of instruction be elevated 
by means of this surplus; the latter should be expended for appur- 
tenances, the usefulness of which is commonly acceded but for which 
parents are unwilling to pay extra charges. 
Our consideration of the political aspects of the report would be 
incomplete were we to omit, in conclusion, its efforts toward equali- 
zation of the various institutions and its recommendation of the 
weaker schools to the economic protection of the State. It maintains 
that endowment funds should go toward the support of poor but tal- 
ented students, recommends the employment of women in the field of 
secondary education as teachers, inspectresses, or members of local 
school boards, and upholds the rights of assistant teachers, especially 
by making an effort toward ameliorating their pecuniary position, 
which offers too great a contrast to that of the well-paid head teachers. 
A similar plan of action is adopted in its support of evening high 
schools. These should be supported wherever local needs demand it, 
and the tuition fee should be as low as possible. The commission is 
manifestly animated by the thought that any one who seeks evening 
instruction after a day’s labor should in every way be encouraged, 
the more so as one in such a position requires further education for 
his own professional suecess. Mention must be here made of the com- 
mission’s earnest, thoughtful care for rural districts. Fora long time 
life in the agricultural districts of England has not been easy, and the 
commission justly remarks that, in the present deplorable condition 
of the oldest and greatest English industry, husbandry, every means 
should be devised to elevate the rural population. Every measure 
appropriate to leveling social distinctions and interesting the separate 
classes of teachers in one another for their common benefit and prog- 
ress is considered beneficial to the profession and indirectly so to the 
State of which it forms a part. 
The same remarks apply to Germany,where the different classes of 
teachers are kept apart by almost insurmountable barriers. In Eng- 
land affairs are not quite so bad. Each teacher there may rise to the 
highest professional dignity. From being the assistant to a village 
teacher, the lowest grade of the profession, an ambitious teacher may 
become a university student, and all schools are open to graduates in 
universities. Similar conditions prevail in Saxony, and perhaps in 
some other of the German States. Prussia is still averse to allowing 
teachers the possibility of unrestricted promotion. In England, how- 
ever, not only teachers of elementary and secondary schools are in 
close contact, but the boundary lines between the schools themselves 
are not sharply drawn. It is a very characteristic fact that the com- 
mission does not advocate classifying of schools according to the kind 
of instruction or the amount of tuition fee charged. The view of the 
commission is that the true value of instruction, its vivifying influ- 
ence on the pupil’s mind, depends less upon the particular subjects 
taught than upon the inspiriting methods by which the mind is 
aroused. 
Reviewing these reflections, we may, in conclusion, deduce the fol- 
lowing results: The whole investigation of the condition of secondary 
education in England, which forms the subject of the report of the royal 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 193 
commission, is distinguished by a careful consideration of public opinion 
manifested by the constitution of the commission, the selection of the 
persons interviewed, the critical review of their expressed opinions 
by the commission, and the unreserved authenticated publication of 
the results of the investigation. The report is a conspicuous testi- 
mony of English common sense. It is impartial in uncovering the 
faults and bringing out the advantages of secondary education as 
at present conducted in England, and shows wise diplomacy in its 
attitude toward the great object which it represents. It manifests a 
uniform good will toward all efforts for the improvement of secondary 
education, sanctions and even encourages local self-government on 
this subject, attaches great importance to making use of what is 
established as well as of transitionary movements, places a high esti- 
mate on the educational character of the law, enters even into the 
details of expenditures for the benefit of youth, favors the protection 
of the poorer classes, and advocates an equalization of social distine- 
tions in reference to students as well as the teachers. 
The lawgivers to whom this report is submitted are to be congrat- 
ulated, and we may express the hope that, even after a first unfortu- 
nate attempt, a law for secondary education in England may in future 
be framed which will embody the spirit of the report of the royal com- 
mission. 
  MANUAL TRAINING IN GERMANY. 
In no ease has manual training been adopted by the authorities of 
any system of schools in Germany. Neither city nor provincial nor 
State authorities have recognized in manual training a study which 
deserves general introduction to the schools, except female handi- 
work, which is found everywhere as an integral part of the course of 
study for girls in elementary schools and in secondary schools for 
girls. Hence, wherever manual training is found in any school in 
Germany it is the result of private initiative. Private persons and 
societies, such as ‘‘societies for the promotion of practical educa- 
tion and handicraft,” have established independent schools for that 
purpose or prevailed upon the municipal or State authorities to make 
a manual training department an annex to some elementary or second- 
ary school of good repute. But while the officers of the regular 
school systems—elementary, secondary, and higher—refuse to intro- 
duce manual training, all the German educational authorities are 
engaged in promoting industrial, trade, and technical schools, both 
elementary and secondary. In the second part of last year’s report a 
statement of the industrial schools in Germany is given which shows 
that the number of such schools is comparatively large. 
The statistics here given are compiled from a recent German report. 
In the absence of later statements, the general results shown must 
suffice. The total number of schools for manual training of boys in

1892 was 328, of which 126 were independent schools, while the others, 
202, were connected with a variety of institutions, such as classical 
and modern high schools, normal schools, private elementary schools, 
orphan asylums, schools for the feeble-minded, deaf and dumb, and 
blind. 
The agencies that maintain manual training are («) special societies 
(50 sehoools and 72 annexes), (b) municipal authorities (70 schools), 
(c) State authorities (66 annexes). Expressed in percentages: Socie- 
ties maintain 38 per cent of these schools, municipal authorities 24 
per cent, States 21 per cent, while private persons maintain 10 per 
eent, church congregations 2 per cent, others 5 per cent.

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 197 
Hence it is seen that the total municipal and State aid for manual 
training (exclusive of tuition fees and expenditures defrayed by pri- 
vate persons and societies) amount to a little over $25,000. But it 
must be remembered that there are a great number of industrial, 
trade, and technical schools in Germany which teach handicrafts. 
These institutions are not counted in the foregoing statement. 
RECENT GERMAN EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE. 
The educational literature in Central Europe including only the German-speak- 
ing nations, the German Empire, Austria, and Switzerland, has been very copious 
in recent years. Treatises on the theory and history of education, text-books and 
guides, reprints of classical and modern writings on educational topics are counted 
by the thousands in one year. A few of these works, being of enduring value, are 
mentioned here, with a brief statement of their contents. No criticism is attempted 
or intended. The article of Mr. Scherer in this volume on the subject of ‘“Cur- 
rents in education” will supply the criticism. Mr. Scherer seems to be recognized 
in Germany as an educational authority, and in national conventions of teachers 
he is recognized as the man upon whose shoulders the mantle of Friedr. Dittes 
has fallen. zs 
(1) ‘Das gesamte Erziehungs- und Unterrichtswesen in den Léndern deutscher 
Zunge.” Im Auftrage der Gesellschaft fiir deutsche Erziehungs- und Schulge- 
schichte, herausgegeben von Karl Kehrbach. Berlin, 1895. 
This is a bibliographical list, with statement of contents of all books, essays, and 
governmental decrees or laws, issued monthly, concerning German education and 
pedagogical science. It contains also information of devices of teaching. The 
value of this new publication lies in the fact that it omits nothing of note. All 
the German educational journals are made to contribute to this work. 
(2) ‘Zeitschrift fiir Philosophie und Pidagogik,” herausgegeben von O, Fligel

with the twelfth century. The author produees undeniable evidences for his 
statements in form of documents from the city archives. He closes his narration 
with the close of the sixteenth century.

The author claims that no demands except those of the science of pedagogy

The common school as an organ of the social body must have an ethical ideal, in 
the service of which all instruction should be placed.

Professor Kiilpe says of this book: ‘‘ Psychology begins to descend from its lofty 
standpoint of exclusive scientific interest. A general desire for psychological 
information is noticeable. In the courtrooms psychological processes are becom- 
ing quite’numerous. In the literature of fiction a psychological tendency is seen, 
and in the State medical examination students in Germany have to undergo an 
ordeal in psychiatry. This proves the necessity of such a book as Wundt’s.”

This work describes the efforts on the part of the Prussian Government, 
prompted by Queen Louise, to regenerate the people through public education

(18) Die Willensfreiheit, von Dr. Paul Michaelis, Berlin. 
After an historical review over the most important attempt to solve the problem 
of freedom of the will, the author tries to show that the idea of ‘‘liberum arbi-

in the Kantian metaphysical sense anything like a freedom of the will.

In normal schools psychology should not be treated as an abstract science, but

psychical phenomena and their laws are derived.

Second edition. 
The author has revised and greatly enlarged his work in this edition, and lays

education of the civilized nations, giving due credit to the men who originated 
ideas. 
(24) Das dsthetische Erziehungs-System, von Dr. A. Wittstock, Leipzig. 
A book in which the esthetic side of education is emphasized, perhaps too 
urgently, but certainly with the best of intentions. The author defines esthetics

tem of teaching which will lead toward ennobling the human race. 
(25) Erziehungs und Unterrichtslehre fiir hihere Mddchenschulen, von Dr. B. 
Ritter, Weimar. 
The fact that the promoters of higher education of women in Germany claim a 
separate course of training for girls, one differing from that of boys in paying 
attention to the inevitable differences in sex, has led the author to write this hand- 
book of pedagogy for girls. The book has found both warm commendation and 
adverse criticism in Germany.

COMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF EDUCATION. 
INTRODUCTION. 
  To state the actual conditions of education of a country for a given year in an 
array of numbers and well-arranged tables is doubtless a meritorious under- 
taking, but for the purpose of gaining valuable knowledge such a presentation 
is insufficient. The most fruitful sources of information are comparison and con- 
trast. If, therefore, the absolute numbers are accompanied by ratios which allow 
a comparison of any separate item of information with others on a uniform scale, 
the presentation will be much better. Thus, for instance, it is well enough to 
know that a country has a certain number of teachers and pupils in attendance at 
school, but better it would be to accompany the actual number by a statement 
showing the ratio per hundred or thousand of the population. Or, if it were 
found that a State had a certain aggregate number of pupils in elementary and 
another in secondary schools, the statement would be greatly improved by show- 
ing that the first number amounts to 95 per cent, the second to 5 per cent, or 
whatever other ratio it would prove to be. 
Still better would be the statements if they were given for a number of years, 
which would allow the computation of a ratio of progress. This would offer an 
unfailing standard of measurement for the progress of that country. For the 
statistician, however, such material would still appear isolated, and he would 
want to place the information of uniform character into line and compare various 
countries by a uniform standard of measurement. 
There are very few items of educational statistics that can be subjected toa 
uniform standard of measurement. The educational institutions of different 
countries vary in scope and organization, so that uniformity in statistics can not 
be attained except, perhaps, in enrollment, attendance, and expenditures. These 
the annual reports of the Bureau of Education have published for several years. 
In the present article the final result of statistical surveys over a long period of 
years is presented. The greater part is the work of Prof. E. Mischler, of Strass- 
burg, Germany. At the outset it must be stated that the statistics he offers are 
not in every case the most recent, owing to the fact that he desires to place the 
various countries as nearly on a level as he can, to apply a uniform standard. 
The following summaries of the systems of education in the civilized world are 
intended to contain the most important data concerning institutions, teachers, 
and enrollment, derived from the statistics of a longer period than is commonly 
considered. These summaries are offered in the briefest possible form.
-P-A-G-E-281
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 201 
  It has not in any case been possible to present the entire system of education, 
especially not with reference to secondary and special schools. Great gaps in the 
statistical structure here presented are noticeable. However, the data covering 
elementary schools are given, and in most cases those of university education also. 
The statistical sources available are often very dissimilar, and they are not by 
any means the most copious and best where culture has reached the highest 
degree of development. It would seem as though the consciousness of success 
quenches the desire to review actual conditions. 
The sources used for the present review are stated under the heading of each 
section. M. E. Levasseur’s meritorious statistical work concerning elementary 
education (see Bulletin de l'Institut International de Statistique, tome VI, livr. 2, 
1892) has been consulted frequently, because his statements rest for the most 
part upon direct authentic information. 
These international comparative reviews are partly based on Levasseur’s work, 
partly on the author’s former compilations, and partly also on official sources. 
The translator substitutes later dates in a few instances when by so doing the 
author's object of placing the various nations on a level is not defeated. 
I,—ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
Of the various categories of educational institutions few permit statistical com- 
parison. They are chiefly those which agree in aims and objects to be attained, 
namely, the schools, variously called public, people's, primary, and elementary, and 
intended to give an elementary education to children of 6 or 7 to 12 or 14 years of 
age. In most countries advanced grades of elementary schools, such as grammar 
and burgher schools, are included in the generic term elementary schools. There 
are differences in the various countries in the method of teaching, and, to some 
extent, in the matter of instruction in these institutions, but for purposes of 
statistical comparision these internal differences may be left out of consideration, 
since they all serve the well-understood purpose of establishing an average meas- 
ure of intellectual culture, the minimum of education requisite for the fulfillment 
of the duties of citizenship.

schools, teachers, and pupils, with exclusion of all private institutions, except in a 
few cases.

If we deduce relative values from the foregoing absolute numbers and other 
available sources as shown in the following tables, it will be seen that the differ- 
ences between the countries mentioned is not very great, despite the divergences

in their school systems. Between 100 and 150 lies the average number of inhab- 
itants provided with one school. Where the number deviates from the average 
peculiar circumstances prevail, as, for instance,in Great Britain (222) and in 
Scandinavia (owing to its ambulatory schools). Rarely are less than 50 and never 
more than 100 children assigned to one teacher, and the quota of pupils to 
every 1,000 inhabitants is generally between 120 and 170. But these averages are 
dependent upon the ages represented in each community, as well as upon the 
frequent or infrequent attendance of other than public schools.

IL—NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The data collected in the two following tables on normal schools are made 
uniform as far as possible. Age of students and length of course are left outsof 
consideration. A special feature of the preparation of teachers is the proportion 
of female students. It must be borne in mind that in some countries women are 
employed as teachers chiefly for special branches (female handiwork, drawing, 
girls’ gymnastics), for which they receive no preparation in normal schools, hence 
the number of female normal school students does not show the same proportion  
-P-A-G-E-284
      
     204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
   
    
   with the number of female teachers employed. The following tables give the 
absolute numbers and the ratios:

               a These figures are not conclusive, since it must be remembered that many of the women 
teachers enumerated in column 3 teach special branches only and have no professional train- 
ing as teachers, while the men are teachers in name and fact. 
Statistics of secondary education must be omitted, since it is absolutely impos- 
sible to collect the numbers under uniform heads, the schools not being State 
institutions in many countries, and where they are so they are of such varieties 
that it would be manifestly unjust to classify them uniformly. 
Ill.—HIGHER EDUCATION, 
The various university calendars contain the number of students in the univer- 
sities and show slight variations between those attending in summer and those in 
winter. The statistics are invariably obtained by direct communication with the 
questor or the secretary of these institutions. Hence they may claim absolute 
accuracy. Moreover, the possibility is given to compare from year to year the 
attendance and show the ratio of progress or retrogression. The following tables 
are obtained from the fourth volume of Minerva, Yearbook of the Learned World, 
Strassburg, 1895. 
The efforts of the authorities in Italy to decrease the number of universities of 
that country have given rise to an animated discussion of attendance of universi-  
-P-A-G-E-285

ties and the cost of higher education. The minister of public instruction in Italy— 
Signor Martini—has added valuable material to this discussion.

  alf the 4 free universities are not counted, the ratio is 1,770,000. 
In the following comparison isolated faculties as they are found in Hungary are 
disregarded, while those of France are counted, in order to obtain numbers com- 
parable with those of other countries. The university college at Dundee, Scot- 
land, is not counted, while for Ireland 3 universities are counted. For Germany 
the academy at Minster is not counted; but on the other hand the legal faculties 
that constitute the universities of Macerata, Italy, and Oviedo, in Spain, are 
included. For France 15 universities are counted, according to more external 
considerations. 
(For statistics of higher education in the United States the reader is referred to 
special statistical tables found in this annual report.) 
The number of universities, it must be said, is not a good standard measure- 
ment for the extent of higher education. The number of students is indeed the
-P-A-G-E-286
206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
better measurement. In taking this latter number, however, it should be care- 
fully considered that in every case both the matriculated students and the hearers 
are included, because if that deduction were made in Germany, where the dis- 
tinction between matriculated students and hearers is sharply maintained, it 
would be an injustice to that country, because in other States the distinction is 
not made in the statistics of attendance, Again, it may be concluded that among 
the hearers there are many foreigners, and hence the differences may be equalized 
by counting in all the students. With these reservations and explanations the

  An article on ‘‘Industrial education in Germany” contained in 
last report of this Bureau (see p. 1215, Vol. 2, Annual Report of 
1895-96) shows what efforts Germany and other German-speaking 
nations are making in preparing young men and women for skilled 
labor, art, and technical pursuits, in order successfully to compete 
with other nations in building up a remunerative industry, and in 
gaining the markets of the world for their products. Naturally the 
commercial schools were mentioned incidentally. Statistics of such 
schools were given, without, however, attempting an exhaustive state- 
ment of their organization, courses of study, and management; nor 
ean this be done now without a description of some of the 247 commer- 
cial institutions of secondary or elementary character, owing to exist- 
ing diversity, an attempt which would be beyond the scope of this 
office. Teachers who are interested in this will find the desired 
information in a book written by Prof. Edmund J. James, entitled 
Education of Business Men in Europe,!and in a German publication 
entitled ‘“‘Kaufminnisches Fortbildungsschulwesen,” by Dr. Stege- 
mann, in Braunschweig. 
In the latter-named book, published in 1896, a description of each 
commercial school in Germany is given with a minute statement of 
the course of study and other details. The book is the result of an 
inquiry of the boards of trade of the most prominent commercial and 
industrial cities of the Empire. The editor regrets that few of these 
schools agree in their courses of study, but he seems to overlook the 
fact that each community has individual needs which, to a certain 
extent, determine the branches of study in both the industrial and 
the commercial institutions. 
Commercial education—that is, a special training for young men?

    who intend to devote themselves to commercial pursuits—has a com- 
paratively brief history, and the system, if we may speak of a system, 
has not reached that degree of perfection which is found in other 
departments of public education. It may be said to be still in its 
infaney. The Germans are quite aware of this, and, situated as they 
are in the center of Europe, they look about themselves to note what 
other nations have done and are doing. It is a characteristic feature 
of the Germans that for whatever they undertake they prepare a 
long way ahead. They are not impulsive reformers, but proceed 
systematically upon the basis of what exists, changing it as times 
and conditions of life demand. At present the various governments 
of the 26 States that constitute the German Empire are employed in 
improving and extending their agricultural, industrial, and commer- 
cial schools to enable the people to compete with their neighbors in 
the world’s market. 
An Englishman, Sir Philip Magnus, in a work on industrial educa- 
tion, expresses himself on this point with felicitous frankness. He 
says: 
The commissioners tell us that the increasing severity of the competition, both 
in our home and in neutral markets, is especially noticeable in the case of Ger- 
many, and in every quarter of the world the perseverance and enterprise of the 
Germans are making themselves felt. In the actual production of commodities 
we have few, if any, advantages over them, and in the knowledge of the markets 
of the world, the desire to accommodate all local tastes and idiosyncrasies, a deter- 
mination to obtain a footing wherever they can and the tenacity in retaining it, 
they appear to be gaining ground upon us. 
This advance of German trade does not appear to be owing to any falling off in 
the efficiency of the British workmen, but solely to the superior fitness of the Ger- 
mans, due exclusively to the more systematic training they receive for mercantile 
pursuits. The commissioners tell us that while in respect to certain classes of 
products the reputation of our workmanship does not stand as high as it formerly 
did, those who have had personal experience of the comparative efficiency of labor 
carried on under the conditions which prevail in England and foreign countries 
appear to incline to the view that the English workman, notwithstanding his 
shorter hours and higher wages, is to be preferred. They further state that in the 
matter of education we seem to be particularly deficient as compared with some 
of our foreign competitors, and this remark applies not only to what is called 
“technical education,” but to the ordinary commercial education which is required 
in mercantile houses, and especially the knowledge of foreign languages. 
The recommendation of the commissioners that Her Majesty’s consular and 
diplomatic officers should be instructed to report any information which appears 
to them of interest as soon as they obtain it, and that it should be as promptly 
published at home when received, has resulted in the publication of a series of 
reports which fully bear out the conclusion at which the commissioners have 
arrived in regard to the deficiencies of our commercial education; to the activity 
displayed by persons in the search of new markets, and the readiness of manufac- 
turers abroad to accommodate their products to local tastes and peculiarities. In 
several of these reports attention has been called to the importance of possessing 
an army of commercially trained agents, who are able to discover foreign mar- 
kets, to inform English manufacturers in regard to the requirements of these 
markets, and to follow the style of homemade goods.
-P-A-G-E-289
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 209 
In order to see how it is made possible for German merchants to 
“storm the foreign markets,” it may be well to look at a course of 
study designed for commercial training. It is a course in vogue in 
the higher mercantile institutions in Germany and Austria. The 
branches are those of a one year’s course: Foreign languages (Eng- 
lish, French, and Italian), political economy, commercial law, commer- 
cial geography and statistics, bookkeeping, commercial and political 
arithmetic, knowledge of international commerce, and knowledge of 
merchandise. The last two subjects bear particularly upon the ques- 
tion at issue between England and Germany, and because they are of 
more than passing interest to American readers they may here be 
stated in detail. 
Knowledge of international commerce.—The object of the lectures on this sub- 
ject is to give the student a concept of the world’s commerce, and to equip him 
with such knowledge as is necessary to successfully engage in international trade. 
In these lectures are treated: 
The origin of the produce exchange; its divisions and organization; the brokers 
and their position on the exchange; legitimate commercial transactions on the 
exchange, and exchange boards of arbitration. 
The legal regulation of a system of weights and measures; the metric, English, 
Russian, and Chinese systems of weights and measures with special regard to 
their position in the world’s commerce; the system of weights and measures of 
the Orient. 
The method used to determine quality in the international grain trade; method 
of determining quality of yarn and silk in international commerce (numbering 
yarn and silk titration); alcoholometry and number measuring (dozen, score, etc). 
The systems of money of those European countries through which balances with 
transmarine countries are mainly adjusted; in addition, the state of the money 
standards, bills, and currency quotations in North, Central, and South American 
markets; also the Eastern Asiatic and Australian markets, and, finally, the money 
standard in the Orient. 
The transportation of goods by railroads and rivers, considering the traffic 
rules; the railroad fares and freight rates; classification of freight in Austria- 
Hungary, Germany, and France; international tariff associations; international 
service, together with the necessary documents. 
Ocean transportation of freight, subdivided into registering, classifying, and 
measuring ocean vessels; the manifest; the book of cargo and the bill of lading; 
letter of conveyance; charter party; tonnage; fixing freight rates; the most 
important steamship companies, their lines and fares; marine freight insurance. 
The price quotations of the most important articles of commerce (grain, flour, 
spirits, petroleum, cotton, coffee, sugar) on the world’s market, together with the 
usages in vogue for cash and time sales. Explanation and computation of equiva- 
lent prices, and the construction of equivalent price tables. 
The explanation of the settlement of balances by exports and imports, to be illus- 
trated by a series of examples taken from actual transactions. (The basis of these 
lessons is a book by Dr. Sonndorfer, ‘Die Technik des Welthandels,” Handbuch 
der Internationalen Handelskunde. Vienna.) 
Knowledge of merchandise.—On the basis of the advanced preparatory study of 
the natural sciences, and after introductory remarks (system, methods of investi- 
gation, microscopy, polarimetry, structural arrangement of organic, vegetable, 
and animal substance) from the purely commercial standpoint, the products of the 
world’s market are considered according to their natural history and physical and 
ED 97. 14   
   
-P-A-G-E-290
    210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
chemical characteristics. After being classified their external and internal mark: 
of genuineness and their adulteration and substitutes are considered. After thi: 
preparation the entire animal, mineral, and vegetable products are separated int 
their organic branches and discussed; but certain home articles of export an 
import are given special attention (groceries, foods, luxuries, drugs, raw materials. 
manufactures of textile industries, and tanneries), besides inorganic products tech. 
nically applied (coal, petroleum, and metals). 
In addition special instruction:on the adulteration of food and its detection i 
given. 
Training in the use of the microscope.—Microscopical tests are thoroughly car- 
ried out for determining raw material and manufactures. The material for these] 
microscopical examinations is taken from the collection of products and from 
objects sent to the school by merchants. To aid in the demonstrations and prac- 
tical exercises, there are (a) a special laboratory for the study of merchandise, 
with a sample collection for direct use during the teaching, (b) a museum of mer- 
chandise, and (c) ‘a professional library. 
Insurance.—Insurance in general, insurance companies, mutual and stock com- 
panies, granting of charters to them, the State’s control of them, laws relating to 
insurance, and fees to the State; insurance against damage; transportation, fire, 
hail, and animal insurance, also reinsurance; life insurance, insurance payable 
at death or at certain age; mutual insurance against sickness or helplessness and 
accident; computing the premium, the reserve, redemption, loans, policies, and 
reductions; the insurance business in its practical workings, closing accounts, 
(profit, loss, and balance sheets). 
It is no wonder that commercial agents thus prepared can go into 
foreign countries and open up the markets for German goods. They 
speak to the people in their own tongues, adapt their consignments 
to the special wishes of the purchasers, with regard to both the qual- 
ity of the goods and the manner of their packing, and with tenacity 
keep open a market where they have once gained a foothold. ‘The 
foregoing abstract from a German course of study proves incontro- 
vertibly that preparation is the secret of success in commercial 
affairs as it is in art and industry. 
In searching for material which would demonstrate to the American 
reader what European nations are doing in commercial schools, a 
pamphlet on the subject was found of much service, written by Prof. 
Ludwig Fleischner in Budweis, Bohemia, Austria, who treats the 
subject in a way which will commend itself to the interested reader. 
He shows what the people in England, France, Austria, Italy, Belgium, 
and Switzerland are doing in the preparation of commercial men, and 
he incidentally offers comparisons which may prove helpful in this 
country. He says in introducing his survey here given entire with 
the exception of a few paragraphs: 
The immense progress the natural sciences, technology, and trans- 
portation have made in recent years has given to the commercial pro- 
fession an importance which could not be foreseen in former years. 
More than ever before has it become the merchant’s duty to act as 
middleman between producer and consumer. In ever-widening cir- 
cles he has to bring the products of agriculture and industry to their 
proper markets. By means of increased taxation which commercial 
enterprises are subject to they support ever more strongly the State

in the discharge of its civilizing efforts. Direct exchange between 
producer and consumer has almost wholly ceased, and the percentage 
of the population devoted to commercial pursuits has increased con- 
siderably in every civilized country. 
Moved by these considerations several European governments have 
of late years bestowed much attention upon commercial training of 
young men, and the results thus far obtained give assurance that the 
further development of schools for that purpose will be commensurate 
with the demands of the times. Hitherto other professions have been 
aided by the State, through the establishment and liberal support of 
institutions of all kinds, while the commercial branch, despite its 
importance for political economy and public welfare, had received no 
worthy representation in the educational system of the various 
European States. Hence it was resolved, as far as available means 
allowed, to subsidize communities, boards of trade, commercial socie- 
ties, and other interested bodies which contemplated establishing 
commercial schools or had done so already. 
AUSTRIA. 
A brief historic view of the development of the commercial-school 
system in Austria is not without interest in our country, where such 
institutions are struggling to rise to a higher plane of usefulness. 
The classical high schools in Austria, founded during the Middle 
Agesand also during the reign of Marie Theresa, did not offer proper 
instruction to young men intending to devote their lives to commercial 
pursuits, and, despite the praiseworthy efforts of the Queen in favor 
of secondary education, the merchants’ best preparation was found in 
the countinghouse and store magazines. In 1762 a few courses of lec- 
tures on commercial arithmetic, discount, bookkeeping, and science 
of government were opened in high schools, which courses were con- 
ducted by “‘piarists” (members of a religious order), and later by 
civil officers; and in 1763 a course of lectures on financial science was 
opened in the University of Vienna, with which Joseph von Sonnen- 
fels was intrusted. But these measures did not suffice for the wants 
of commercial men, since both the high schools and the university 
had the avowed purpose of preparing civil officers for financial and 
administrative offices. 
In the year 1769 purely commercial training began in consequence 
of a ‘‘manifesto” of the supreme commercial authority of the Empire, 
the Board of Trade of Vienna, which document pointed out frankly 
that the preparation of merchants had heretofore received inadequate 
attention. In 1770 a State institution for the preparation of merchants 
was opened under the name ‘‘Commercial Academy.” It received 
an annual subsidy of 3,000 florins (about $1,500). The institution 
had two grades of one year each, in which arithmetic, ethics, grammar 
(and rhetoric), geography, calligraphy, drawing, accounting, com- 
mercial science, geometry, natural science, double-entry bookkeeping, 
and French and Italian were taught. Financial difficulties prevented 
a vigorous development of the school, which, nevertheless, kept alive 
as a State institution for over thirty years. In 1804 the school was 
reorganized and classified among the newly established modern high 
schools (Real-Anstalten, socalled in contradistinction to classical 
schools), but in 1815 it again assumed a purely commercial character 
as a department of the new polytechnic institute, the foundation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
which had been suggested, if not demanded, by a sudden development 
of commerce and industry in Austria soon after the Napoleonic period. 
A further step is worthy of note. In 1852 a number of ‘‘Real- 
Anstalten” (modern high schools) were established by private enter- 
prise, and the one which had hitherto acted as preparatory school for 
the commercial academy severed its connection with the polytech- 
nicum. The academy thereafter admitted only graduates of ‘‘ Real- 
Anstalten,” whereby the attendance was greatly diminished. In 1865 
the institution had to be abandoned, being superseded by the Vienna 
City Commercial Academy, which had the identical purpose of the 
former State institution, while the polytechnicum was raised to the 
rank of a university, with whose aims, equipment, and methods a 
commercial course was not thought to be in harmony. But as early 
as 1840 a Johann Geyer had opened a private institution which was 
imitated in the principal cities of the country. Other commercial 
schools of lower order, partly founded by stock companies, partly by 
private enterprise, have since come into existence and proved to be 
an important factor in the Austrian educational system. 
Legislation also has frequently been attempted in the organization 
of commercial schools. An important legislative regulation is found 
in the law of November 20, 1868, for Lower Austria concerning the 
establishment and maintenance of industrial supplementary schools. 
According to this law the industrial and commercial schools are sub- 
ject to the legislature of the crownland, while in other parts of the 
Austrian Empire they are subject to regulations issued by the minister 
of public education. A ministerial order of May 14, 1870, refers to 
the examination of teachers in commercial schools. In February, 
1872, an inquiry into the organization of commercial schools was 
instituted, resulting in a conference which submitted material for a 
bill which became law February 23, 1873. This law divides all the 
secondary commercial schools of Austria into public and private, 
higher and lower schools. A ministerial order of May, 1884, changed. 
the regulations concerning the examination of teachers, and another, 
dated September 25, 1892, refers to teachers in the lower schools. 
According to these regulations two kinds of commercial schools, to 
wit, schools of two and of three year courses were recognized as lower 
and higher schools, the latter being called commercial academies. 
A special board for the examination of teachers in commercial schools 
and academies was appointed for Austria, which board has its seat in 
Vienna. 
By means of these regulations a sharply defined boundary line has 
been established between the schools of two-year courses and the 
academies of three-year courses. Special attention is bestowed by 
the Government upon these lower schools, they being much more 
numerous than the academies. It must be explained, though, that 
the difference of one year in the length of the course is not the only 
reason for calling the one kind of schools lower and the other higher 
institutions, but pupils of 13 or 14 years of age may enter a lower 
school with only elementary preparation, while admission to an acad- 
emy presupposes graduation from a secondary school; hence the entire 
course of the three-year institutions is of ahigher kind. The minister 
of education, in recommending the passage of the law of 1892, said: 
To bring about the establishment and extension of the system of schools with a 
two-years’ course is a necessity, since commercial clerks have not hitherto been 
prepared professionally to an extent commensurate with the needs of the com- 
mercial world, Hence, wherever communities, boards of trade, and commercial
-P-A-G-E-293

societies find suitable occasion for opening such schoo's, the State should do all in 
its power to aid them in their laudable efforts. 
The Austrian Government has done much in aiding the movement 
with both advice and material support. The best measure seems to 
have been the appointment of imperial inspectors for commercial 
schools, who watch over their pedagogic and didactic development. 
A normal plan of study has given this class of schools a firm founda- 
tion, because it was framed according to the needs of the great mass 
of people, with elasticity enough to meet local demands. This course 
lays especial stress upon instruction in the mother tongue and modern 
foreign languages. I'urthermore, in order to aid the founders of such 
schools in their work of organizing and to secure for them a material 
basis of funds, the minister of public instruction published an organi- 
zation statute, according to which all the commercial schools of recent 
origin have been established. The same authority undertook the 
publishing of a series of uniform text-books, and secured an annual 
appropriation of 68,000 florins ($34,000) from State funds for the 
support of commercial schools. 
It seems worthy of mention that at present the State is urged 
strongly by commercial men to establish more higher commercial 
schools and support them exclusively from State funds. Itis argued 
that the State provides higher industrial, agricultural, forestry, 
and mining academies for leaders.in industry, agriculture, forestry, and 
mining, while for the mercantile branch no State institution exists. 
The merchants feel that the education of their assistants is not of 
such a high order as that of the members of other callings, and they 
attribute it to the want of institutions of a high order. At present 
the commercial branch is entirely dependent for the best preparation 
of its members upon higher schools established by local authority or 
private enterprise—institutions which charge high tuition fees; hence 
are attended by wealthy youngmen only. This opinion found expres- 
sion in the legislature. During the debate on the educational budget 
March 8, 1894, Deputy Dr. Hallwich expressed regret that commer- 
cial training had as yet received no adequate State support. Of 
the merchant, he urged, much greater demands are made than for- 
merly, owing to freer commercial movement all over the civilized 
world, and it would therefore be wise if the State authorities paid 
more attention to proper preparation of men who might become leaders 
in commerce, as the State prepares leaders in every other field of 
human exertion. The speaker recommended this matter to the atten- 
tion and special care of the Government. 
The latest action in this matter was taken by the board of trade 
and industries in Vienna, and followed a suggestion made by the 
Vienna society for mercantile interests, to the effect that the Crown 
ministers be informed of the inadequacy of State support for commer- 
cial training. In order to bring about a relief of the overcrowded 
Vienna Commercial Academy, the board of trade recommended the 
establishment of several parallelinstitutionsin Vienna. Theseschools 
should be so located as to accommodate the students in other parts of 
the city; they should be granted the same privilege regarding the 
voluntary (one year’s) service in the army, and should be prohibited 
from charging higher tuition fees than other State secondary schools. 
The board of trade further expressed the opinion that besides these 
commercial academies in Vienna, the State should either establish or 
liberally subsidize a sufficient number of lower commercial schools (of 
two years’ course). Such schools had proved very serviceabie to pre-
-P-A-G-E-294
  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  pare well-trained merchants, and if more were established they might 
aid in relieving the overcrowded condition of the Vienna academy. 
The board expressed the hope that the State would establish at least 
one higher institution of the kind proposed, which might act as a 
model for the whole country. Lastly, the board proposed that a State 
organization be called into existence which would induce cooperative 
action by the many mercantile societies and boards of trade, an organ- 
ization whose advice should be solicited on all questions concerning 
the commercial schools of the State. 
In 1896 Austria (without Hungary) had— 
15 higher commercial institutions (called academies). 
20 secondary commercial schools. 
6 private commercial institutions, partly secondary and partly elementary. 
62 elementary commercial schools and 
18 commercial schools connected with other institutions. 
In the nature of the case the youngest institutions have still the 
frailty of infancy, but the tendency of the time and the immense exten- 
sion of commerce, both inland and international, will strengthen them. 
The question of technical preparation for commercial pursuits in Aus- 
tria has been in the hands of well-meaning experts, and it is to be 
hoped that the reorganization of the system and its adequate expan- 
sion will form another chapter of the educational system of which 
Austria has reason to be proud. A characteristic feature of the com- 
mercial institutions of learning in Austria is that they stand upon the 
solid basis of experience and attempt to meet the just demands of the 
time. In their organization, course of study, and training they are 
practical. They do not consider it a fault, but a virtue, in this period 
of the division of labor, to eliminate all matters not distinctly mercan- 
tile and to bestow their attention chiefly upon languages and commer- 
cial sciences; in short, upon subjects which are of importance to our 
present civilization and the calling for which these schools are designed. 
It will take time to offer for admission candidates with appropriate 
preparation, i. e., young people who early in life have been destined 
for commerce, and not those who land in the harbor of a commercial 
school after having failed in a classical high school. There are too 
many students yet who enter commercial schools because of insuffi- 
cient talent or diligence to master the studies prescribed as the prepa- 
ration for university work. The greater the interest which merchants 
show in these schools the better will be the students offered for 
admission. 
To complete the survey of Austria it may be stated that in Hungary 
also new regulations have been issued lately concerning high commer- 
cial schools. As in Austria, the authorities in Hungary insist upon 
graduation from a modern high school (Real-Anstalt) as a condition 
of admission to a commercial academy, and prescribe a three years’ 
course. The languages taught are Hungarian, German, French (or 
Italian or English). Aside from languages and common branches, the 
following studies are taught: Knowledge of merchandise, chemical 
technology, political and commercial arithmetic, counting-house prac- 
tice, bookkeeping, correspondence, political economy, and commercial 
law. The authorities which supervise these schools are the crown 
ministers of commerce and of public instruction. These authorities 
send deputies to the graduation examinations, and State inspectors 
appointed by the minister of public instruction visit these schools at 
intervals.

  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 215 
ENGLAND. 
England has for centuries enjoyed the glory of being the foremost 
commercial country in the world. It is astonishing, therefore, from 
the standpoint of continental Europe, to notice that for commercial 
training of young men the Government in England does less than in 
any other country. If private enterprise, corporations, and commer- 
cial clubs had not taken care of commercial education by establishing 
appropriate courses in a few secondary schools, primarily founded for 
other purposes, one would think England had no scholastic commer- 
cial training. In this respect Austria, France, and Germany do much 
more. 
A comparison of the English school system with those of the three 
countries just named will explain this singular deficiency. Before 
1850 the Government of Great Britain did not concern itself with 
public education. Since the Middle Ages the principle has prevailed 
in the British Isles that the State as such had no more right to inter- 
fere in the educational affairs of the people than the people had a 
duty to tolerate such interference. Even now, after several decades 
of State education, compulsory attendance is left to local option. In 
the classical land of self-help and self-dependence schools and other 
educational institutions of the most varied types originate in private 
initiative, and only within the last generation has legislation changed 
and the old principle been abandoned. 
At the head of those interested in the promotion of commercial 
training stands the London Chamber of Commerce, in consequence of 
whose urgent appeals there has been great activity in behalf of com- 
mercial education, and a uniform organization of schools for that pur- 
pose has resulted therefrom. A report of Sir John Lubbock proposed, 
in 1887, a uniform scheme of study for the various commercial courses 
existing in secondary schools. The London chamber adopted the 
essential features of Sir John Lubbock’s plan by issuing a uniform 
course of study, which, however, the Government was unable to adopt, 
owing to its want of jurisdiction in secondary schools; hence the 
course had to rely upon the initiative of the various chambers of com- 
merce in the large cities of the Kingdom. The support given to it is 
an indirect one. It consists in this: That the merchants belonging to 
the chambers of commerce agree to engage as assistants and clerks 
only those who have had the preparation prescribed in the course 
mentioned, or at least to give preference to applicants who can prove 
such a preparation. This course was framed by a committee of the 
London Chamber of Commerce and adopted by the chamber Decem- 
ber 14, 1887. It consists of a ‘‘ junior course,” designed for boys 10 to 
16 years old, and a ‘‘senior course,” for boys over 16. The instruction 
in the various branches prescribed is to be fashioned to suit the age 
of the pupil, and the whole time devoted to it must cover a period of 
six years. 
However, a cursory examination of this course of study plainly 
shows that the Englishmen have not arrived at the same estimate of 
a thorough commercial instruction prevailing in continental Europe, 
although the chamber had consulted French and German models in 
framing the course, to wit, the ‘‘plan d’études de lenseignement 
special” in vogue in France, and the programmes of the commercial 
schools in Munich and Leipzig. The English course contains subjects 
the especial profit and value of which for future merchants is not 
clearly seen, and, on the other hand, it does not contain studies which
-P-A-G-E-296
216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  seem indispensable for commercial pursuits. For instance, in the 
course for the second year (for boys of 11 to 13 years of age) we find 
drawing (two hours a week), free-hand, shaded construction of geo- 
metrical figures and simple objects of daily use, geometrical drawing 
according to measure, sketching, and india-ink shading. In the third 
year (for boys of 12 to 14 years) we find drawing (two hours a week), 
shade projection of cubes, spheres, leaves, and architectural frag- 
ments; elements of architectural drawing. These subjects seem out 
of place in a commercial school, says Professor Fleischner. On the 
other hand, we miss in the course such subjects as cambistry (science 
of exchange), political economy, as well as some essential features of 
bookkeeping and accounting, the importance of which is beyond 
question in commercial practice. Still, such deficiencies are met by 
an explanatory remark which accompanies the document, to wit: 
This course, together with the time-table attached, is to be regarded merely as 
a guide, a declaration of principles according to which the chamber would like to 
see commercial instruction conducted. The detail may be arranged for each year 
to suit the needs of each school. Full liberty is desirable in this. 
After the sixth school year the juniors must submit to an examination 
in the following obligatory studies, and in at least one optional study: 
(a) Obligatory studies: English and literature, French (eventually 
German, Spanish, Italian, or Portuguese), history of the commerce 
of Great Britain and her colonies, commercial geography, arithmetic, 
mathematics, bookkeeping, drawing. (b) Optional studies: Mechanics 
and hydrostatics, sound, light and heat, electricity and magnetism, 
organic chemistry, natural history, geometrical drawing, shorthand 
writing, and Latin. Having passed the examination, the pupil receives 
a “junior commercial certificate.” For pupils of only elementary 
preparation an examination is held at the close of the third year, which 
entitles them, if successful, to a ‘‘certificate of elementary commer- 
cial training.” 
For the senior course the following obligatory branches are proposed: 
Foreign languages, that is, two of the following, French, German, 
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Latin; mathematics, including higher 
commercial arithmetic and geometry; commercial geography; uni- 
versal and commercial history; political economy and banking; insur- 
ance; commercial and factory laws; drawing and photography; 
natural sciences, to wit, chemistry, physics, mechanics, mineralogy 
and petrography, metallurgy, botany, zoology, and the use of the 
microscope; practical exercises in the laboratory. For this senior 
course, also, an examination is provided, after which a “‘ higher com- 
mercial certificate” is granted. For this examination the following 
studies are obligatory: Two foreign languages, English and literature, 
mathematics, commercial history, and geography. 
Owing to the omission from this course of studies, of branches abso- 
lutely essential for thorough commercial preparation, the plan did not 
remain without serious opposition on the part of prominent experts. 
During the general meeting of members of chambers of commerce in 
1887, the representatives of the Bristol chamber said that not only 
prominent school men had denounced the plan of study, but very few 
chambers, despite their formal approval, had felt impelled to estab- 
lish commercial schools on the proposed basis. The chambers of 
Manchester and Edinburgh recently worked out kindred courses of 
study, which they fashioned after German and French models, with 
this essential difference, that the courses are intended for both boys 
and girls.
-P-A-G-E-297
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 217 
  General approval has been given by people interested in the sub- 
ject to the emphasis with which the importance for future English 
merchants of a facility in foreign languages was urged. It was said 
that English merchants, above all other things, need to learn foreign 
languages, and he who knows the peculiar conditions of English edu- 
cation will agree that the ignorance of foreign tongues in England is 
widespread.! In Austria and Germany foreign tongues have been 
the most prominent feature of commercial training. 
Of the London schools which adopted the scheme proposed by the 
chamber of commerce may be mentioned the famous King’s College. 
The institution arranged not only a ‘‘senior course” for boys over 15 
years of age in evening classes, but also a day-class department pre- 
paratory to the evening commercial course. Thisdepartment prepares 
merchants, clerks for civil service, and other occupations or profes- 
sions. In this department the chief attention is paid to the study of 
German and French. The prospectus of King’s College says: 
The special subjects of study in this division are French and German, whichare 
taught colloquially as well as grammatically, and include commercial correspond- 
ence. If desired, Spanish and Italian are taught as subjects of private tuition. 
The other branches taught in this department are: Commercial geog- 
raphy and history, arithmetic, bookkeeping, calligraphy, drawing, and 
shorthand writing. Lessons in religion are given to every student, 
unless the parents request that they be dispensed with. Another 
important London school, having its own commercial department, is 
the Royal Polytechnic Institute, which prepares its students for the 
acquisition of a ‘‘ chamber of commerce certificate,” and likewise acts 
as a normal school for commercial teachers. Special mention should 
be given the secondary school established in 1866 by the ‘‘ Corpora- 
tion for Middle Class Education.” This school is located in Cooper 
street, City Road. It has become one of the foremost public high 
schools of London under the skillful guidance of its principal, Dr. 
Wormell. According to the explicit order of its founders, the institu- 
tion has the chief purpose of giving young people who intend to enter 
upon commercial pursuits a preparation suitable for their future 
vocation. Itintends not only to give them suitable instruction, but 
also ‘‘ train them in those habits and views which will secure for them 
the best and most lasting success in their future positions.” The pro- 
       
1 Professor Fleischner, in stating the fact that few English merchants know for- 
eign tongues, seems to attribute it to the system of training in vogue in England. 
But that is not the real reason. It is the result of “a natural cause,” so to speak. 
English, of all the modern European tongues, is easiest to learn. It has scarcely 
any inflections and no difficult syntax. Compared with German and French it is 
almost grammarless. Speaking English is building a wall with unhewn stone, 
while speaking German means hewing each block to fit the place; the English- 
speaking person uses much mortar in form of prepositions to show the relation of 
words. Hence the acquisition of the English language in early youth does not 
give that linguistic training which children of other nations get, and which 
enables them to master foreign languages. Everyone whose mother tongue is 
difficult to learn and to use, on account of its wealth of forms of inflection and 
difficult syntactical rules will, of necessity, acquire a linguistic training in early 
youth which enables him to grasp other idioms with ease. The Germans learn 
foreign tongues quite readily. They even learn to speak Latin in secondary 
schools.» More talented in languages even than the Germans are the Russians, 
whose language is rigid in forms and finely inflected. But the easy, unruly 
English is bound to become the language of trade all over the world, and more- 
over it will remain the language that brings forth the greatest orators. It is like 
a handy tool toa workman. A jackknife may be used for a variety of purposes, 
while a finely mounted and adjusted instrument may be useful for a few purposes 
only.
-P-A-G-E-298
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
gramme of this school includes English and its literature, history and 
commercial geography, mathematics, calligraphy, bookkeeping, chem- 
istry, drawing, French, vocal music, and the elements of natural 
science. German is an optional study. * * * 
As has been stated before, the first step toward a systematic teach- 
ing of commercial branches was taken by the London Chamber of 
Commerce by proposing a model course which unfortunately proved 
inadequate. Butthis influential body intends to go further and estab- 
lish, on a large seale, a commercial college of six grades, in case its 
new proposition finds general approbation, and it is confidently 
expected that this institution will find many imitators and lead to 
other establishments all over England. Already the consciousness of 
inadequate commercial training among the English merchants has led 
to changing purely classical secondary schools into commercial col- 
leges. An example of this is the ‘‘City of London School.” This 
institution, founded by the city authorities as a kind of classical high 
school, did not find the desired support among the people, and it was 
soon found desirable to add a technical course in which foreign lan- 
guages, bookkeeping, political economy, and shorthand writing were 
prominent features. From the annual report of the principal, Mr. 
Pollard, it is seen that this technical course has constantly inereased 
the number of students, while the classical course has decreased to 
small dimensions. The trustees and faculty of the school are contem- 
plating a radical change by abandoning the classical and substituting 
acommercial department. Such facts as these indicate the drift of 
sentiment. 
SWITZERLAND. 
The third country in which commercial training has become an 
object of great solicitude is Switzerland. An animated discussion 
has been going on there for the purpose of elevating the commercial 
training of Swiss young men. During the proceedings of the conven- 
tion, called for a revision of the Federal constitution, which held its 
sesssions from 1871 till 1874, it was pointed out by prominent writers 
and speakers that professional commercial education should be made 
a Federal concern. An article was inserted in the constitution, accord- 
ing to which the Federal Government was granted the right ‘‘ to estab- 
lish higher institutions of learning and to subsidize those already in 
existence, except the universities, which shall remain exclusively can- 
tonal institutions.” However, since the adoption of the constitution 
this right has not been exercised for the benefit of the mercantile 
calling, though a Federal polytechnicum has been established in Zurich. 
Yet no calling needs Federal aid more than the commercial, for it has 
been acknowledged in most civilized States that mere routine work 
and tradition of countinghouses does not suffice, but that the mer- 
chant needs a special technical education in order to meet the ever 
growing competition with other countries. 
Whenever in Switzerland a school question comes up, several factors 
are to be considered—the Federal and Cantonal Governments, commu- 
nal authorities, chartered corporations, and private enterprise. All 
these elements had been set in motion to aid commercial education, 
but without any noticeable effect. On December 8, 1888, at last the 
support of commercial schools was discussed in the Federal Parlia- 
ment, and the discussion resulted in the adoption of a set of resolu- 
tions, the salient points of which may be quoted: 
The Federal Council (the executive Federal authority) is requested to investigate 
the question whether Federal aid can be applied under the constitution for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 219 
  purpose of establishing a higher commercial college and a commercial museum— 
that is to say, whether the law of June 27, 1884, according to which industrial and 
professional schools may be subsidized, can be so interpreted as to include the 
establishment of a commercial school with Federal funds. 
Meanwhile several private commercial schools had been opened, 
which were inadequate to meet the highest demands. The Federal 
Council, urged by numerous petitions of commercial clubs and schools, 
went further than it originally intended. It contemplated the estab- 
lishment of a central Federal commercial school on a grand scale. 
When, however, the plan was submitted to judicial authority it was 
decided that a school with such narrow professional aims would not 
be in harmony with the intentions of the framers of the constitution, 
but that the establishment of a central Federal schoool for ‘‘ Swiss 
law and science of government” might be within the constitutional 
limitations, since its purpose was general and benefited all classes of 
society. In such a school the merchants might find information on 
questions concerning them. 
The alumni of the Federal polytechnicum petitioned the Govern- 
ment to establish in that institution a commercial department, 
intended for the highest education of merchants, for it was argued 
that every industry had a commercial aspect which deserves prepara- 
tion, and commercial science and modern languages were especially 
mentioned as the branches for such a department. The Council, 
however, failed to act on the petition. 
The plan of establishing a central institution of the highest grade 
for merchants in Switzerland is therefore held in abeyance for the 
present, and the attention of men interested in the subject is con- 
centrated on the improvement of commercial schools subsidized by 
the Federal Government and of private institutions. The Federal 
Council, April 25, 1891, passed a resolution which regulates the rela- 
tion of the State to commercial institutions, the four articles of which 
read as follows: 
ARTICLE 1. To the institutions of learning which, according to the law of June 
27, 1884, are entitled to Federal aid are added the commercial schools, and hence 
the regulations concerning other schools will be applicable to them also. 
ARTICLE 2. The executive authority is,hereby empowered to grant subsidies to 
commercial clubs for maintaining schools, and to grant scholarships to students 
for meritorious work and excellent results.achieved in Swiss commercial schools, 
as well as to grant stipends to Swiss graduates of such schools for the purpose of 
attending foreign higher commercial institutions. 
ARTICLE 3. Minute regulations for carrying out this order are to be published 
by the executive, similar to those in force for other callings. 
ARTICLE 4. The sum of 60,000 francs ($12,000) is hereby appropriated for this 
purpose for the year 1891. 
After this brief historical review, it may be stated that the develop- 
ment of commercial education in Switzerland took essentially the 
same course which it took in England. About forty years ago com- 
mercial departments were added to cantonal, city, or private high and 
industrial schools. The typical form in which these secondary schools 
appear is that of a uniform course, which, after three or four years, 
is bifurcated into technical and mercantile divisions. Side by side 
with these general secondary schools a few independent commercial 
schools are found. These have a two years’ course. 
Since the organization of purely commercial schools and depart- 
ments of schools differs in the various Cantons (a peculiar feature of 
all educational institutions in Switzerland), it would seem proper to 
sketch a few schools which have become typical, i. e., those of Bern, 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  Basel, and Geneva. The commercial school of Bern is a department 
of the city high school. Although a city institution, it receives aid 
from the cantonal government. It is a classical high school, bifur- 
eated in the higher grades. The course is uniform for all students 
from the tenth to the fifteenth year of age; after that the commercial 
department continues for two years. The uniform course contains 
French and English, so that the students come into the commercial 
course with a good linguistic training. In the latter course the 
studies are as follows: Physics, chemistry, knowledge of merchandise, 
drawing, calligraphy, gymnastics, science of trade, history, geog- 
raphy, countinghouse work and bookkeeping, mathematics, commer- 
cial arithmetic, German, and religion. The total number of hours of 
instruction per week is thirty-seven in the first, thirty-six in the sec- 
ond year. The entire institution is governed by a board of trustees 
of nine members, of whom five are appointed by the Canton (or State), 
four by the city. The tuition fee is 60 francs ($12) per annum. For 
the second year a number of scholarships are granted. 
In Basel also the commercial school is not an independent institu- 
tion, but a department of the city high school. Upon a common basis 
rest the two sections, the technical and the commercial. The former 
has a course of three and a half years, the commercial one of three 
years. Both departments are under the same authority and super- 
vision. Tuition is gratuitous, as it is in all city schools of Basel. 
The course of the commercial department contains the same branches 
found in the Bern school. The number of hours per week is thirty- 
one in the first, thirty-two in the second, and thirty-three in the third 
ear. 
Until 1887 commercial training in Geneva was given in the commer- 
cial department of the cantonal high school, but in that year an inde- 
pendent high school for commercial branches was established by the 
city, the former institution was abandoned, and the high school 
reserved for university preparation. The new school requires the 
candidate for admission to be 15 years of age. He must have passed 
through five grades of a college or the second grade of a professional 
school. For students who can not comply with these requirements a 
preparatory department of two years is provided. The tuition fee is 
100 franes ($20) for Swiss students, but double that amount for 
foreigners. Nonresident students who come to study only a few 
branches pay 5 and 10 francs ($1 to $2) per week. The direction 
and supervision of this institution lie in the hands of an administra- 
tive board of twelve members, four of whom are appointed by the 
Canton (or State) and eight by the municipal council. The expenses 
for 1893 amounted to 32,800 franes ($6,456), of which the Canton of 
Geneva paid 6,725 francs, the city 20,155 francs; 6,000 franes were 
paid by the students. The course includes the following branches: 
French, German, English, Italian, Spanish (the last three languages 
are optional studies), calligraphy, drawing, bookkeeping, mathe- 
matics, geography, history, physics, chemistry, civil law, insurance 
and tariffs, knowledge of merchandise. At stated intervals excur- 
sions are made to mercantile establishments, after which the students 
report in class of what they have seen. This leads to discussions on 
questions of the day. The number of hours a week is thirty-three in 
the first and second, thirty-four in the third year. The language 
lessons per week are as follows: French, three; German, four; Eng- 
lish, four; Italian, four; Spanish, three. The most prominent branch
-P-A-G-E-301
      COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 221      
   
     is countinghouse practice, for which eight hours a week throughout 
the three years are reserved. 
Similar independent schools for commercial training are found in 
Neuenburg, Solothurn, Winterthur, and Chaux-de-Fonds. In addi- 
tion to these there are in Switzerland eleven commercial departments 
connected with classical and technical high schools. Commercial 
instruction of a lower order is offered also in ‘‘ continuation schools” 
for elementary pupils, and commercial clubs arrange evening courses 
for apprentices here and there. 
As a model of a commercial “continuation” school may be men- 
tioned the school in St. Gall, where French is taught three hours a 
week throughout a four years’ course; English, Italian, German, pen- 
manship, commercial arithmetic, discount, and civies are the other 
branches. In summer the school is held from 6 to 8 a. m., in the win- 
ter from 7 to 9 a. m., and from 6 to 9 p. m. in both summer and winter. 
All utensils and stationery used in the school are furnished by the 
teachers, for which in summer 1 franc, in winter 2 franes, are paid by 
the student. 
The educational activity of commercial clubs is chiefly directed 
toward the advancement of their own members in certain branches. 
Several such clubs recently formed a national union, which now con- 
sists of eighteen sections, of which the Swiss Mercantile Society of 
London, England, is one. Among these eighteen sections, that of 
Zurich is the most prominent. It maintains a commercial school of its 
own; it received in 1894 a federal subsidy of 5,000 franes ($1,000). 
The section club in Basel maintains courses in bookkeeping, short- 
hand, and commercial law, as well as several courses in languages. 
The bifurcation of the cantonal high schools in technical and com- 
mercial departments, spoken of before, has not been attended by 
felicitous results. It has been found that the commercial instruction 
based on a common course of preparation with that of other high 
school departments is lacking certain elements essential for success. 
This is the reason why the independent commercial schools are increas- 
ing in number and gaining in popularity. 
In 1893 the total Federal subsidy for commercial education in Switzer- 
land amounted to 87,490 franes ($17,498), of which 46,800 franes were 
spent for commercial schools; 38,640 franes were paid to commercial 
elubs, and 2,050franes for scholarships, of which one is used in Venice 
and two in Munich. In conclusion, it may be stated that the educa- 
tional authorities of the Canton (or State) of Zurich in 1893 petitioned 
the Federal Government for a subsidy for a girls’ commercial school. 
This petition was not granted, though, because the Federal executive 
interpreted the law of 1884 as giving no authority to extend commer- 
cial training to girls. Similar petitions have been sent to the Federal 
Government from Berne and Biel. There is, however, little doubt 
that these petitions will soon be granted, inasmuch as the commercial 
department of the technical school at Winterthur, which receives a 
Federal subsidy, admits girls. The local authorities of that city are 
highly in favor of the extension of the subsidy to schools for both 
sexes. 
Thus we see that the people of Switzerland are desirous of keeping 
up with other nationsin the commercial training of young men. From 
the willingness with which Federal, cantonal, and communal authori- 
ties contribute to that end, the future may be judged. For a long 
time Switzerland had not an institution for the special training of 
merchants, though they are the basis of wealth, aiding and directing

industry; but in late years great zeal is shown in raising the commer- 
cial branch of the nation’s activity to a higher level of culture. The 
fact that the nations surrounding the mountain Republic are eagerly 
increasing their connections with foreign and transmarine markets, 
and for that purpose prepare suitable agents, may have led the Swiss 
people to imitate. They certainly had a splendid example in Austria, 
as we haveseen in a foregoing chapter. 
FRANCE. 
In the year 1820 two French merchants, Messrs. Brodard and Legret, 
who were anxious about the future of French commerce, conceived 
the plan of establishing a school in France in which young men 
should receive instruction preparing them to be merchants. Relying 
on their own means, the yopened such a school in Rue de Grenelle, 
calling the institution “ Keole spéciale de commerce.” 
The fitness of such an undertaking would at present be self-evident 
at a time when the necessity for commercial training is recognized 
everywhere, but at the time when Messrs. Brodard and Legret opened. 
their school the enterprise was considered a very bold one. Few 
thought of the necessity or even of the possibility of such a technical 
instruction for which hitherto practical work in the countinghouse 
and store magazines had fully sufficed. Few believed that the com- 
mercial sciences as such could be made subjects of scholastic instruc- 
tion, owing to the great number of special branches of which these 
sciences are composed. The establishment of such an institution, 
for which there was no model in existence in France, met with the 
greatest obstacles. An attempt had to be made to combine the 
various commercial branches of knowledge into one science, to find 
or to prepare suitable teachers for that purpose. Other circumstances 
added to the difficulty. Frenchmen seemed to have no decided com- 
mercial sense or interest in commerce, although it was then flour- 
ishing. France, furthermore, was, after the Napoleonic wars, in a 
condition which prevented a far-sighted policy with regard to com- 
merce and industry. 
All these things combined to prevent young men from attending 
the school in Rue de Grenelle. They wished to be admitted to the 
bar, become physicians and authors rather than merchants. Entrance 
into the mercantile profession seemed a degradation for which no 
especial scholastic preparation was required. Hence the new school 
could not expect a flourishing growth. The trustees were well-experi- 
enced men, who attempted to frame a study plan suitable for the 
requirement of commerce. Men like Casimir-Périer, J. B. Say, Ch. 
Dupuy, J. Lafitte, and others framed a plan for this new school, 
whose course was one of three years. At first some students entered 
the institution, partly resident Parisians, partly from other parts of 
France, but after ten years of wrestling with new problems the insti- 
tution was closed. Several times it had changed directors. 
In 1830 Adolph Blanqui undertook to revive the school. He first 
changed the name of the institution to ‘Ecole supérieure de com- 
merce,” which name it has retained to this day. Blanqui may justly 
be called the organizer of commercial education in France, for to him 
are due its principles. For twenty-five years he stood at the head of 
this school, whose reputation spread all over Europe,! but the num- 
  
‘Tt is interesting to learn that in Austria this French school has been taken as 
Eimodel; for instance, i in the establishment of the Commercial Academy in Prague, 
oO" 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 223 
ber of its students remained small. After Blanqui’s death the insti- 
tution met many kinds of obstacles, until, in 1869, the Paris Chamber 
of Commerce took possession of it. Meanwhile several other schools 
were established in France, mostly in imitation of Blanqui’s insti- 
tution. 
The commercial schools of France may be divided into two groups. 
The first comprises seven higher institutions, of which two are in 
Paris, five in the provinces. The second group contains four second- 
ary schools, of which three are situated in Paris. Beside these insti- 
tutions there exist numerous schools of an elementary character for 
adults of both sexes. Hence there are really only eleven distinetly 
commercial schoolsin France. The Superior School of Commerce, the 
School of Commerce, and the School of Higher Commercial Studies are 
all under the direction of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris, which 
undertook the management of the first in 1869, the second in 1872, 
and the third in 1882. The commercial schools in Lyons, Marseilles, 
and Havre, as well as the Commercial Institute in Paris, are main- 
tained by private corporations. The school in Rouen is connected 
with the school of science and letters of that city; the school in Bor- 
deaux is connected with an industrial school, while the school at 
Rheims is under the direct supervision of the minister of public 
instruction. This city has, besides, a school of commercial practice 
under private management. Most commercial schools in France are 
managed by a board of trustees called comité, usually chosen from 
among the prominent merchants of the city in which they are situ- 
ated. In Paris the chamber of commerce elects the trustees from 
among its members. In the board of trustees of the school of Mar- 
seilles two teachers act as expert counselors, while the higher school 
of commerce in Paris has a supplementary council of 25 members, 
the French minister of commerce being the chairman. 
The State subsidies paid for commercial education are quite large, 
as will be seen from the following statements: A ministerial decree of 
February 1, 1849, granted sixteen scholarships of 500 franes ($100) each. 
This sum was afterwards greatly increased, and taken from the funds 
at the disposal of the minister of commerce for the promotion of com- 
merce and industry. In the year 1875, for the first time, a definite 
amount (equivalent to $6,000), was appropriated for that purpose, and 
this amount was increased (to $8,000) in 1883. The State budget of 
commerce in 1884 contained $5,000 for the improvement of a building 
occupied by commercial schools. This appropriation was increased. 
to $8,400 in 1886. Annual appropriations were also made for travel- 
ing expenses paid to graduates of higher schools of commeree. In 
1886 $3,600 was used for that purpose. This action of the House of 
Deputies found general approval, since the importance of traveling 
was recognized for these students; partly, also, because it was shown 
that other countries had set the example in this policy. A special set 
of regulations was adopted for the manner of granting these stipends. 
The minister of commerce is the final judge in the matter. 
The courses of study in most French commercial schoolsare arranged. 
for three years, that of the school in Lyons for four years, while in 
Bordeaux and Havre only atwo years’ attendance isrequired. Foreign 
students are required to pass through a preparatory department, in 
which they are expected to familiarize themselves with the French 
language. Theage at which students are admitted is 15 years; schools 
which have a preparatory department admit to that at 14 years. 
The following branches are generally found in the French commer- 
cial schools: French, algebra, arithmetic, geometry, bookkeeping,
-P-A-G-E-304
224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
commercial law, physics, chemistry, history, commercial geography, 
drawing, shorthand writing, and two foreign languages. These 
branches are taught in thirty-one weekly hours. The number of pro- 
fessors varies between 9 (in Havre) and 32 (in Paris). The teachers’ 
salaries are arranged according to the number of lessons they give per 
week and the importance of their subjects. A peculiar feature of this 
is that the professor of law is paid six times the amount which the 
professor of bookkeeping receives. 
In all French commercial schools weekly excursions are arranged 
to factories and large mercantile establishments, museums, and exhi- 
bitions. Since it is impossible to take a large number of students to 
one place, small groups are conducted by their teachers to various 
points on the same day. In France the numerous museums, art col- 
lections, monuments, and exhibitions are much more frequently 
utilized as agencies of education than in other countries. Elementary 
classes are taken by their teachers, on days when school is not in 
session, to museums and collections, to monuments and statues of 
noted men, where appropriate instruction is given. It is noteworthy, 
also, that the French commercial institutions of learning have many 
foreign students. In the superior school at Paris one-third of all the 
students are foreigners; the school at Marseilles has about 30, that 
of Havre about 50, foreign students. Diplomas are awarded to suc- 
cessful candidates who pass the final examination; in some of the 
institutions silver and gold medals are given for meritorious work. 
The diplomas of the Superior Commercial School, and those of the 
School for Higher Commercial Studies are signed by the minister of 
commerce. 
A few details about the ‘‘Eeole Supérieure de Commerce” in Paris 
may conclude the review of French commercial education. This 
institution was founded in 1820 and transferred to the Chamber of 
Commerce in 1869. It is now situated at No. 102 Rue Amelot. The 
prospectus for 1895 says: The course is one of three years, but well- 
prepared students have the right to enter the second grade at once. 
The age of admission is 15 years. The students of the third year are 
guided by their professors to factories of Paris and vicinity, and 
report in writing what they have observed. The same students under- 
take a journey annually into the northern part of France or into Bel- 
gium in order to study the coal mines, means of transportation, and 
other things interesting to merchants. The students’ reports of this 
excursion are submitted for competition; the best composition is 
awarded a traveling scholarship of 1,000 frances ($200). Examinations 
are held every three months, reports of which are sent to the parents. 
At the close of the course, medals are distributed which are provided 
by the Chamber of Commerce, the Society for the Promotion of Com- 
mercial Geography, and the Society of Alumni. The students who 
pass the final examination have the right to limit their service in the 
army to only one year, and the aid of the school is offered to them to 
secure acceptable positions in the commercial world. The State 
grants 12 scholarships to worthy students. Like most French schools 
of this kind, the superior commercial school has dormitories connected 
with the institution; in this school tuition, room, and board cost $400 
a year, payable in three installments. 
  BELGIUM. 
At the head of the commercial institutions of learning in Belgium 
stands the ‘‘Institut de Commerce” at Antwerp. The establishment
-P-A-G-E-305

of this noted institution is due to the former minister of state, M. A. 
Dechamps, who submitted the plan for such a school to the city coun- 
eilof Antwerp and to the provincial governmentin 1847. At thesame 
time a merchant, H. Mathysseus, published a pamphlet: ‘‘ Proposi- 
tions for the establishment of a Belgian university for commerce and 
industry.” However, public opinion and the existing universities in 
Belgium opposed this plan, claiming that the science of commerce 
was not equal in importance to the university studies; hence the min- 
ister’s plan was finally adopted and the institute of commerce opened 
with 51 students on October 22, 1853. The city council undertook its 
maintenance and management, and the State guaranteed to pay one- 
third of the expenses. This school has educated over 4,000 students. 
The institute of commerce has an organization similar to the uni- 
versities of Belgium, but unlike other schools of that country, it has 
no dormitories; the students live in private houses. The course is 
one of two years. Anexaminationis required for admission; exempt 
from this examination are graduates of the Belgian Athenzeum, or 
any institution of Belgium ranking with this high school. All candi- 
dates for admission must prove that they have sufficient familiarity 
with French, English, and German. For the purpose of obtaining 
well-prepared students, a preparatory department has been added, 
in which only those branches are taught which fit the student for 
admission to the institute. The lowest age at which admission is 
allowed is 164 years. The branches in which the candidates for 
admission are examined are French, English, German, bookkeeping, 
geography, mathematics, chemistry, physics, history, commercial law, 
and political economy. 
The most important place in the course for the first year of the 
institute is the practical work in the model countinghouse. Here the 
more theoretical branches have their focus. Here is utilized that 
which is taught in the scholastic branches. In the countinghouse the 
mercantile practice is imitated in its smallest details and widest bear- 
ings. Regular business transactions take place, and every student 
in turn is made to participate in all kinds of transactions and occu- 
pations. Business correspondence is first carried on in French, then 
in the other languages taught. Every month stock is taken anda 
balance sheet furnished. During the first year business is done only 
with European countries; in the second year the business is extended 
to transmarine countries. All the bearings of trade are taught, so 
that the students gain a clear view of commerce and its ramifications 
all over the world. 
The lessons are distributed in hours per week, as follows:

  Besides these regular lessons and leetures, occasional talks-are give 
by prominent merchants, manufacturers, engineers, and other experts 
on subjects closely connected with mercantile pursuits.. Onde 
the school is: not in: session, visits to commercial and industrial estab- 
lishments are made by the classes,. conducted by their teachers; but,. 
unlike the commercial schools in Paris, this institution does not 
arrange for discussions on the part of the students. Lately it has 
been urgently advocated to add aithird year to the course. This third 
year should be devoted chiefly to the legal aspect of commerce, and 
should serve as.a special preparation for consuls, since in Belgiunr 
the consular service is chiefly recruited from among the merchants. 
Every regular student is. examined at the close of the first.and of 
the second year. Having passed the final examination, the: student 
reeeives a diploma: entitling him: to the degree of ‘““Lieencié dans: les 
études de commerce.” The examining board consists.of seven mem- 
bers:appointed by the minister of commerce from among: the leading 
merchants and the professors of the institution.. The Government is 
represented at this examination: by the imspector-general of com- 
meree. Graduates receive, upon application, traveling stipends, 
which are paid by the State. The legislature or parliament appro- 
priates 45,000 franes,. or $9,000; annually for that purpose, and the 
stipends vary between $1,000 and $1,200 per annum, according to 
the country to which the students go. They: must agree to stay three 
years in that country. During recent years the: graduates. receiving 
stipends have sojourned in transmarine countries, Argentina, Brazil, 
China, Japan, India, Australia, and New Zealand.. They have estab- 
lished Belgian agencies for commercial firms in these countries, and. 
have opened new channels of trade for Belgian products of industry. 
Some: of these graduates: have’ been appointed Belgian consuls: in 
foreign: countries. 
Despite the undeniable advantages derived from the: Antwerp: com- 
mercial institution, it can not besaid thatit has found general approval 
in public opinion. In Belgium a certain prejudice; entertained even 
by educated people, against the commercial calling seems: to: react 
against the State’s subsidy for scholastic preparatiom of merchants. 
The idea.isstill prevalent that practice alone canserve:as proper prepa- 
ration for a.merchant, and that all theoretic instruction issuperfiuous. 
It is not considered: that theoretic instruction is the: basis of continu- 
ous: self-culture, and that in this century of science, discovery, and, 
invention neither the merchant norone in.any other profession: or call- 
ing can be properly prepared without thorough scientific work; and 
furthermore, that without familiarity with foreign languages no mer- 
chant can enter into competition with the merchants of other countries 
in the world’s markets. Other countries have found that the money 
spent in educating and training commercial students is by no means 
squandered, but yields large interest. 
For sixteen years the institute in Antwerp struggled for existence, 
and in 1869 it had only 67 students, of whom 35 wereforeigners., Since 
then the attendance has increased, partly owing to a reduction in the 
tuition fees, partly owing to the stipends paid to graduates by the 
State. Belgium, with a population of over five and a half millions, 
among whom the industrial and commercial people are very numer- 
ous, would seem to need more than 80 graduates per annum from the 
only higher commercial institution the country possesses. TheBelgian 
“ Atheneums” or high schools give also commercial instruction to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-307

limited degree, but their graduates rarely devote themselves to com- 
mercial pursuits. 
In conclusion, a society may be mentioned which owes its origin to 
the Antwerp higher commercial institution. It is the ‘Société des 
anciens éléves de l'Institut de commerce” (society of alumni), which 
has the purpose to acquaint the commercial world with all the new 
ideas that intimately concern Belgian commerce. The members are 
earnest supporters of their alma mater. The society arranges public 
lectures on political economy and participates in international ecom- 
mercial congresses representing Belgium. It grants scholarships to 
students of the institute and publishes a periodical in the interest of 
Belgian commerce. 
ITALY. 
The beginnings of commercial training in Italy do not date back 
many years. The law which organized public instruction was passed 
im 1859, and in this law an article referring to commercial education 
determines that those who intend to devote themselves to commercial 
“as well as any other technical” pursuits, should attend the ‘‘Instituti 
tecnici,” so ealled in contradistinction to classical high schools. 
These institutions have a section for agriculture and technology, and 
another for commercial studies (sezione commercio e ragioneria). 
Graduation from these institutions enables the students not only to 
gain good positions in mercantile houses, but entitles them also to 
certain State offices. 
The commercial “sections” or departments in technical high schools 
offer instruction in bookkeeping, correspondence, knowledge of mer- 
chandise, banking and commercial law, and French, while German is 
an optional study. There are aboutsixty of such institutions in Italy. 
They are subsidized by the State, but, according to the verdict of the 
mereantile world, they are not sufficient to meet the ever growing 
demands of the time. A higher institution was needed such as nearly 
every profession and ealling had. The universities prepared for the 
learned professions; the engineering school at Milan prepared thor- 
ough technologists and engineers; the school of shipbuilding at Turin 
thoroughly prepared shipbuilders; artists had several schools, and 
the school of design at Genoa prepared young men for industrial arts. 
Only the merchants had to rely on secondary schools. At last, in 1867, 
a beginning was made to supply the want. 
It was in Venice, the city which had been famous for many cen- 
turies for her extensive commerce and successful industry, where 
higher instruction for commercial men was begun. In July, 1867, the 
- directors of the “‘Stabilimento tecnico” petitioned the eity council 
for an appropriation with which to establish a higher commercial 
school. The city council, and other bodies addressed for the same 
purpose, declared their willingness to aid the institution, since the 
need of better preparation for merchants was aeutely felt. After an 
executive committee had been appointed, the Royal Government was 
also asked for a subsidy. This Government was willing to contribute 
annually to the maintenance of such a school if the founders would 
consent to devote it to three purposes: (1) To offer higher instrue- 
tion for mercantile pursuits; (2) to give mstruetion in law for the 
professional preparation of consuls, and (3) to aet as a normal school 
for teachers of commercial schools, and for that purpose lay especial 
stress upon the teaching of foreign languages. The Government  
-P-A-G-E-308
  228 .. EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  provided further that the board of trustees of the institution should 
have one member proposed by the Government. 
In 1871 the institution was opened under the most favorable aus- 
pices. The number of students was considerable, and it has since 
steadily grown. The school is called ‘‘Regia Scuola Superiore di 
Commercio” (Royal Higher School of Commerce), and it has five 
yearly grades. At first a preparatory department was maintained, 
but that has been found unnecessary and has been abandoned. At 
present (in 1896) the institution is condueted by Senator Francisco 
Ferrara. The province of Venice pays a sum equivalent to $8,000, 
the city of Venice $2,000, the board of trade $2,000, and the Italian 
Government $6,000 per year for its maintenance. 
Tt has its seat in the palace Foscari, which has been given over to 
this purpose by the city council. The school takes regular and irreg- 
ular students. The latter prepare themselves for particular branches, 
such as the consular service. Candidates are required to submit to 
an examination for admission, except those who graduated from 
technical lyceums (modern high schools). This examination includes 
the Italian language and literature, geography, history, arithmetic, 
algebra, physics, natural history, French, and shorthand writing. It 
is possible for a candidate to enter the second year’s course if he is 
in possession of the required knowledge and has passed his seven- 
teenth year of life.. The tuition fee amounts to 50 florins (about $25) 
perannum. Extraordinary students pay 6 florins ($3) per annum for 
each branch of study they choose. The Royal Government, as well as 
the other agencies which support the school, grant scholarships; the 
same is done by the boards or chambers of commerce in other cities 
when they send students to this school in Venice. 
In accordance with the expressed desire of the Royal Government, 
the school consists of three departments: (1) The general department, 
which prepares students for commercial pursuits in a three years’ 
course; (2) the consular department, which has a course of five years, 
and (3) the commercial normal school, which prepares teachers for 
commercial schools in a course of four years. In this latter-named 
department the chief studies in the first year are political economy 
and. statistics; those of the second year are the common commer- 
cial branches; those of the third year are knowledge of merchandise 
and chemistry, and those of the fourth year are foreign languages. 
With this normal school department a practice school is combined, 
in which the students learn how to teach the commercial branches. 
The studies of the other two departments are, aside from the purely 
commercial studies,.commercial history and political history, English, 
French, Italian, German, and one oriental language, international - 
law, criminal law, constitutional law, court procedure, commercial 
and maritime law, and in the consular department certain additional 
branches are taught which are prescribed by the Government and 
refer to consular practice. 
. Graduates receive diplomas, and those of the normal school have 
the right to teach the commercial branches in any school in Italy. 
The discipline is very strict; punishment begins with simple censure 
and may end in expulsion. A board governs the school. To this 
board representatives are sent by the Venice Board of Trade, the city 
council, the province of Venice, and the Italian Government. The 
director or principal is assisted by two secretaries. Subsidies from 
State, province, city, and the board of trade, together with the tuition 
fees, suffice to defray the expenditures. The school has no fund.
-P-A-G-E-309
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 229 
The professors are paid between $600 and $1,500, and their appoint- 
ment, dismissal, or promotion has been reserved to the Government. 
At date of last report (1894) the institution has 18 professors and 2 
assistants. 
The school has the rank of a university, and graduation from it 
entitles the student to the same rights granted to graduates of State 
universities. This commercial State institution has rendered very 
valuable service to Italian commerce. It possesses an extensive 
museum of merchandise and a large library, for the maintenance and 
extension of which 1,000 florins ($500) are used annually. Besides 
these it has the entire equipment of a first-class commercial school. 
However, the Italian merchants persist in engaging German clerks 
in preference to Italian. Still, the school in Venice has found two 
imitators—one in Genoa and one at Bari. The future of these two 
institutions seems to have been secured, since, as the reports say, 
their instruction is purely technical and of a practical character. 
This is a feature which is generally appreciated by merchants who 
are not given to theoretical consideration of any question. Anything 
that.is not directly aiding the technical preparation of merchants 
is excluded from the course of study of these schools. 
In 1875 a committee was formed by the board of trustees of. the 
school in Venice, whose business it is to help the graduates of the 
school to secure lucrative positions. At the head of this committee 
stands the president of the chamber of commerce. The results of the 
committee’s labors are very satisfactory. Not a single graduate of 
the school has remained unemployed. 
The modern Kingdom of Italy has done much in the field of educa- 
tion and instruction. It has called into existence establishments 
which have become famous. In regard to commercial education it 
has not remained behind other countries. In Turin a commercial 
school of three grades was founded in 1856. Its founder was a gradu- 
ate of the Paris ‘‘ Ecole supérieure de commerce,” Jean Joseph Gar- 
nier. Other commercial schools in Italy are of later date. There is 
one in Florence, established in 1877; one in Genoa, founded in 1883. 
Other large cities in Italy—for instance, Rome and Naples, in which 
a certain industrial feature is prominent—have commercial schools 
supported by private persons, communities, boards of trade, or com- 
mercial societies. The school founded and maintained by the society 
of ‘‘Archimedes” in Turin occupies a peculiar position. It is now 
(1895) 14 years old, has 60 classes and 64 teachers. In 1894-95 it had 
1,675 students, male and female, and 1,300 graduated after one year’s 
study. The course of study includes Italian language, arithmetic, 
bookkeeping, penmanship, French language, drawing, electro-tech- 
nology, shorthand writing. The girls learn, besides most of the fore- 
going branches, sewing and embroidery. 
The right to attend a common commercial course is obtained by 
passing an examination before a government commissioner, but if the 
student wishes to study languages and geography he is obliged to pass 
an examination for admission to a university. In other words, these 
two branches, belonging to the university course, are classed among 
the branches of higher education. For ordinary commercial branches 
a diploma of graduation from a lyceum is sufficient. 
The foregoing statements concerning the commercial training in 
France, Belgium, and Italy plainly show that the authorities lay par- 
ticular emphasis upon the technical training in commercial schools, 
but they do not neglect the educational side which tends to general
-P-A-G-E-310
230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  eulture, moral and intellectual. It may be desirable to touch upon 
this point with reference to professional schools of all kinds. 
The development of the entire educational system, which has 
increased at a rapid rate and in a most satisfactory manner in recent 
decades, has resulted in a division of labor, owing to the ever- 
increasing amount of knowledge and skill to be gained, and this has 
caused the establishment of many kinds of professional and technical 
schools which lay more stress upon special and less stress upon general 
education. These schools, obedient to the urgent social demands of 
the time, have become a very important factor of the educational 
agencies of the modern nations. They are intended to give a special 
training which formerly was rarely offered in schools, and it is 
expected to be done in the shortest possible period, with the least 
expenditure of money, and upon a basis of a brief preparatory study. 
There is little doubt that these institutions meet the requirements 
in regard to special or technical training; for private persons, as well 
as municipal and State authorities, continue establishing schools of 
this kind, and their graduates are generally found to meet the require- 
ments of practical life. But quite another question is whether these 
schools are truly educating their students. 
It is a postulate of pedagogy that every kind of instruction—hence, 
special, technical, or professional instruction not exeepted—has an 
educational influence. Every school must have a twofold object, (1) 
to give technical knowledge and train the intellect, and (2) to ennoble 
the soul and establish character. In this latter sense all instruction 
may be educative if it be good and in accordance with the proper 
spirit, but it is nevertheless essential in special schools to keep in 
mind the distinction between mere instruction and educative instrue- 
tion. 
The demand for education or ethical training, and the endeavor to 
give it much room without infringing upon the purely technical train- 
ing, have become more important since the changed social conditions 
have laid upon the schools duties which the family and home used to 
perform—that is to say, ideas of morality and religion, good manners, 
and public spirit are expected to be ineuleated by school education. 
Under the pressure of business and in the haste with which everything 
is done, and must be done, the home has lost its influence upon the 
young generation, and the school is asked to supply that ethical train- 
ing which will make good men and women of our boys and girls. 
Hence every school must make it an object of its work to offer both 
teaching the intellect and training the will. 
It is plain that the commercial schools must not stand aside in this; 
that they, like all other educational institutions, must aim at an edu- 
eation which is following certain higher considerations than how best 
to enable their students to earn their living. They should aim at 
ethical perfection of their pupils, at ennobling and training of their 
characters, at the education of a generation filled with public spirit 
and patriotism, a sense of true humanity, justice, and regard for the 
law, faithfulness to principles and constancy in action. In fact these 
schools, certainly no less than other schools, should aim at all those 
virtues which make good men first before they think of becoming 
good merchants. 
There are a great number of educational momenta to be considered, 
not to speak of what these schools as such may demand of their stu- 
dents. Obedience to orders, attention, courtesy, truthfulness, reg-
-P-A-G-E-311

ularity—virtues which are conditions of every healthy school 
organization. 
At the first glance it would seem as though such ideas could only 
be taught in connection with religion and history, but the best ocea- 
sions after all are those which the teaching of the mother tongue offers. 
It is therefore very essential for commercial students to have a 
“reader” (text-book for reading), which contains suitable matter for 
ethical instruction. It has often been said that the reader in the 
class room is the center of instruction. This book is not superfluous 
for commercial schools. It may offer numerous occasions for ethical 
instruction, which without such a book might never be given. By 
means of analogy the interest of the students may he awakened in 
events outside of home and school. The various institutions of char- 
ity, which, following the humane spirit of the times, are established 
by State and community, may arouse the students to an early con- 
sideration of public affairs, so that the blighting egotism, so easily 
engendered by the study of commercial branches, may be counter- 
acted by influences which will aid in making good, public-spirited 
citizens of the young. The reader may give the starting point for 
lessons which bookkeeping, arithmetic, and similar technical branches 
ean not give. Yet even the purely technical branches should be 
pressed into service of the one supreme object of the school: To make 
good men and good citizens.

CHAPTER VIL 
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN SWITZERLAND, FRANCE, 
AND ENGLAND.    Attempts made in this country in behalf of teaching civies (the 
science of the State, its constitution and functions) make it desirable 
to see what is done in this direction in other countries. Naturally 
the reviewer's glance turns first to countries of a similar form of gov- 
ernment, to wit, republican government, which we find in France and 
Switzerland. There is not another country in the world that has a 
government more popular than Switzerland has, and it is gratifying 
to note that in that Republic civies is a regular branch in the advanced 
elementary schools (the so-called Fortbildungs-Schulen). In the fol- 
lowing pages a translation is presented of the little text-book used for 
the purpose of teaching civics (Staatskunde) in Switzerland. Its 
author is Dr. Albert Affolter, of Solothurn (Souleure). 
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN SWITZERLAND. 
I.—THE STATE IN GENERAL. 
A.—THE COMMONWEALTH. 
1. The Commonwealth.—Man has the desire not to live alone, but to join other 
men and associate with them. The simplest and most original association of 
human beings is found in the family. Several families unite together to form a 
tribe, a community, a province, a nation. The reason why human beings unite to 
form society lies in the feeling that only by means of a common, firmly established 
order of intercourse prosperity and protection against hostile attacks can be 
secured. Society thus formed, if settled, is called a community. 
The purposes of the community are preservation of peace and order in the interior 
and protection against common foes, as well as promotion of the common weal. 
These purposes give the community the qualities of a public alliance, or union, or 
society. This public community is distinguished by the purposes mentioned from 
all other unions which may be formed for economic, religious, social, and other 
purposes (business companies, cooperative societies, clubs, etc.). 
2. The State.—The highest community is the State. It is an association of 
human beings formed by means of firmly established organization, limited toa 
clearly defined country or territory. The human beings belonging to this associa- 
tion called State are the people; the established order or organization is the legal 
order, and the land occupied by these people is the territory of the State. Hence 
the State consists of land or territory, legal order, and the people. The order pre- 
vailing is the result of organization, and the State therefore appears as a being 
endowed with life, the state system, which has a will of its own, the will of the 
233
-P-A-G-E-314
234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
State, and active organs, the officers of the State. It is, so to speak, a person hay- 
ing tasks to perform and entering into communication with other States. 
3. Communities.—Even within the confines of the State there are public asso- 
ciations—the communities. They, too, have the object to maintain order and pro- 
mote public affairs. But the community does not haye the object to protect its 
members against attack from without; the State alone does that. Like the State, 
the community has a clearly defined territory, a population, and a firmly estab- 
lished order. According to their objects the communities are of different kinds. 
There are civil, church, and school communities. 
B.—Kinps oF SrarEs—ATTRIBUTES, 
  4. Sovereignty.—The term sovereignty is used with respect to States as well as 
persons. 
The sovereignty of the State means its independence of other States and its self- 
government in arranging its own affairs. <A State, therefore, is sovereign when it 
stands in no relation of dependence and has complete freedom of action in its 
interior. There is also a limited sovereignty. Itis even possible to speak of the 
sovereignty of a community, since the communities have for certain purposes full 
liberty of action, to regulate their own affairs, for instance. 
The sovereignty of persons means that they have the highest power in the State. 
Thus we designate rulers (emperors, kings, princes, etc.) with the term sover- 
eigns. Where the people themselves represent the highest power, we speak of 
the people’s sovereignty. 
5. Republic and monarchy.—According to the manner in which the State is 
organized we speak of its being a republic or a monarchy. 
In the republic the highest power remains with the people. Itis the sovereign. 
Its will determines every public question. To direct the State, only such men are 
called in whom the people have confidence, and they stay in office only so long as 
they please the people. At the head of the Stute, therefore, there are men who 
are elected, that is, chosen, either by the people or its representatives. The repub- 
lic rests on the people. If this will is expressed directly, so that the people decide 
all important questions and perform the chief elections (voting and electing orally 
in town council or by means of the ballot box), the republic is a purely demo- 
cratic one. If, however, the people designate by means of elections certain repre- 
sentatives who are to perform the business of the State in the people’s name, the 
republic is called a representative democracy. 
A monarchy is a State in which the sovereignty is not in the people, but ina cer- 
tain person, the monarch. He comes into power by inheritance belonging to the 
ruling family or dynasty (hereditary prince or monarch). In former times the 
monarch could also be elected in that he was an electoral prince or monarch. The 
sovereignty of a monarch has been circumscribed and limited in most cases by the 
will of the people’s representatives (parliament), to the end that he can not insti- 
tute an important measure without the consent of parliament. States in which 
the people’s representatives in parliament assembled take part in directing public 
affairs are said to be constitutional States. 
6. The State of law.—The association called State is made possible only by firmly 
established legal order. Every officer of the State is obliged to conform with this 
legal order, and no one is allowed to violate it. It must be possible to bring to 
the notice of an independent judicial court any arbitrary harmful action and all 
violations of the law on the part of public officers. A State in which the law is 
thus respected and the necessary institutions for its application are provided, so 
that no violation of law, even though it be that of the highest officer, remains 
unpunished, we call a perfect State of law. It is that State in which no one 
stands above the law and dares to defy it.
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 235 
1. Federation of States and union.—Small States frequently observe the neces- 
sity to join forces, in order the better to withstand attacks from without. This 
attachment of several States may be a loose or close one. A federation of States 
is called a group of States joined together so that each State loses some of its sov- 
ereignty toward the outside world, but notin the interior. In this case each State 
is left free in the management of its own affairs so long as they do not conflict 
with the common purposes of the federation. A union,on the other hand, is a 
firmly riveted combination of States,in which the latter lose a part of their sov- 
ereignty toward the exterior as well as the interior. The authority they lose is 
bestowed upon the central or union government, which has permanent offices. A 
union of States bears in itself the possibility of developing into a single State. 
The Swiss federation was loosely combined from its origin until the year 1798, 
and then again from 1803 until 1848. Between 1798 and 1803 it was a union, and 
since 1848 it has again assumed the character of a union. 
C.—DUTIES OF THE STATE. 
8. In general.—The State has duties to perform in the interior and in relation 
with other States. It tries to promote peaceful intercourse with other States, and 
if the necessity should arise, to repulse unjustified attacks with the aid of the 
army. In the interior it maintains order, cares for the common weal, and protects 
the liberty and rights of each citizen. In the performance of these duties the 
State, or rather its officers, must be very diligently active. Those who stand at 
the head of the State promote the relations with other States and represent it 
toward the outside world. In the interior the officers see to it that the functions 
of the State are performed without hindrance. The officers and their work are 
called collectively the government. Since the rules for the interior order and the 
rights of the citizens are not at all times the same, but are ever requiring 
improvement, it becomes necessary to change them from time to time. The 
activity of the organ that is intrusted with such changes is called legislation or 
lawgiving. The officers designated to perform such work are the legislators. In 
cases in which the law is violated, certain officers of the State see to it that the 
law is vindicated. This action is called the judicial duty of the State, and the 
officers charged with it the judiciary of the State. The State also sees to it that 
it has means at hand to secure and protect the possessions of the State, to promote 
general welfare, to improve the army and other means of defense; in short, to 
carry into effect all those measures which are for the general benefit and are 
provided for by legisiation. This extensive activity as a whole is called the 
administration, and the officers who are charged with its performance are the 
organs of administration, often called the authorities. Hence the work of the 
State is divided into three great divisions: (1) Legislative branch; (2) adminis- 
trative branch, and (3) judiciary branch. The first makes the laws, the second 
executes them, and the third defines and, if necessary, vindicates them. 
9. Separation of powers.—It is generally required in the modern State nowa- 
days that the officers of the different branches should be separated—that is to say, 
that those active as lawgivers should not at the same time be executors or vindca- 
tors of the law, but that there be separate officers for each branch. This separa- 
tion is carried out in nearly all constitutional States of the civilized world. 
10. Self-government.—The State’s officers do not perform all the work necessary 
to be done for the State, but they leave much of it to be done by parts of the State 
and by communities. In a federation, the separate States make, execute, and vin- 
dicate laws for their own territories, and the communities again as parts of the 
State do the same in affairs concerning themselves only. This free use of the right 
to act for the common weal given to communities is called self or local govern- 
ment, also local administration.
-P-A-G-E-316
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
D.—TERRITORY AND POPULATION OF A STATE. 
11. Territory.—The territory of a State is the extent of land within its bounds. 
All persons and possessions occupying the territory are subject to the law of the 
State. ‘ 
12. Population.—The population of a State is distinguished as citizens, inhab- 
itants, or residents. Citizens are those who enjoy the civil rights of a Stat=; col- 
lectively, they form a people or a nation. Civil rights embrace certain privileges, 
as the right of suffrage and eligibility to public office, which are denied to resident 
foreigners. A citizen living in a foreign country enjoys the protection of the State 
to which he belongs; this protection is guaranteed by means of ambassadors and 
consuls. Inhabitants, are those who reside permanently in the State; the term 
includes citizens and resident foreigners. Besides inhabitants, the term residents 
includes all sojourners (travelers, tourists, etc.). The law of a State applies to 
any person during his presence within the confines of its jurisdiction. 
E.—LEGAL ORDER OF THE STATE. 
  13. In general.—Law is the established order of a State. All organizations ofa 
State, its division, official power, and reciprocal relation of public officers, as well 
as the judicial relations of population, are fixed by law. Law makes a State of 
population and the territory which it occupies; the whole being of aState depends 
uponit. The term law defines not only order of a State, but the rights of the 
individual which pertain to him because of legal order. 
14. Division of the legal order.—The rules of order are contained in certain laws; 
sometimes custom determines action in cases for which there is no prescribed law. 
Laws and judicial customs are the sources of jurisprudence. 
The chief of all laws is the constitution, containing the principles of a State; it 
is the fundamental law of a country, and treats of the organization and division 
of a State and the relation of public officers to one another and the people. A 
series of minor laws refer to judiciary details relative to the administration of 
justice-and the rights and duties of individuals. The constitution and the laws 
of administration are known as public law. We distinguish others:—Laws of 
litigation apply to detailed proceedings in the administration of justice; penal 
laws define what actions and omissions deserve punishment and how severe the 
punishment may be; laws of private and civil rights apply to the private relationr 
of citizens, as the family, possessions, business, contracts, claims and debts, inher: 
itance, etc, We may define civics as the study of the law and working of a State. 
II.—SWITZERLAND IN GENERAL. 
A.—HIsToRY OF THE STATE SYSTEM OF SWITZERLAND, 
15. The old confederation.—The league of the three districts, Uri, Schwyz, 
and Unterwalden, in the thirteenth century was the germ of Switzerland. A 
Latin contract signed by these districts in 1291 is still extant. The league was 
formed for defense against attacks from without, and particularly against the 
rulers of Hapsburg-Austria. After the glorious battle of Morgarten, 1315, it was 
renewed at Brunnen. Soon afterwards neighboring cities and districts joined the 
alliance—Lucerne in 1332, Zurich in 1351, Glarus in 1352, Zug in 1852, and Berne 
in 1353. The league now comprised the so-called eight ancient cantons. In the 
year 1481 Fribourg and Soleure were admitted. Later on Basel (1501), Schaffhau- 
sen (1501), and Appenzell (1518) joined. From now on until 1798 Switzerland 
formed a league of thirteen cantons, to which several friendly and affiliated dis- 
tricts, as well as different houses and families, belonged. Common affairs were 
discussed and regulated by the diet, which consisted of delegates from the separate 
cantons.
-P-A-G-E-317
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS. IN EUROPE. 237 
  The old league was a confederation. It dissolved in 1798 because of the conse- 
quences of the French revolution. 
16. The Helvetic union.—Owing to the attitude of France, the necessity of acon- 
stitution was forced on Switzerland in 1798. The old league was thereby converted 
into a union under the name of the one indivisible Helvetic republic. The one 
undivided republic consisted of 19 cantons which were not States, but only admin- 
istrative districts without sovereignty. The conversion of the old confederation 
into a union was accomplished too suddeniy and occasioned great difficulties. 
17. Acts of adjustment.—As a union proved indefensible under existing condi- 
tions, the First Consul of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, framed a new constitution 
for Switzerland in 1803. It was called acts of adjustment or mediatory constitu- 
tion. Switzerland thus became a federation of 19 States, very nearly sovereign. 
The confederation, however, approached close to a union. The highest authority 
was vested in the diet, to which each canton sent one delegate. Only cantons with 
more than 100,000 inhabitants were allowed tosend two delegates. Six representa- 
tive cantons alternately directed affairs. The president of the diet received the 
title of landamman of Switzerland. In granting more rights to the people, this 
constitutional adjustment brought about a better state of affairs than existed prior 
to 1798. 
18. The federal agreement of 1815.—The fall of Napoleon nullified the constitu- 
tion forced upon Switzerland by him. With the cooperation of the great powers 
of Europe, a new constitution, the federal agreement of 1815, was brought into 
effect. Switzerland then became a federation of 22 sovereign cantons. At the 
Diet, in which each canton had one vote, the delegates of the cantons were obliged 
to speak and vote as they had been instructed by their governments. The number 
of representative cantons was limited to three and the office of landamman of 
Switzerland abolished. The adoption of the constitution of 1815 was a decided 
step backward; no rights were granted to the people, and the privileges of old, 
aristocratic families were not expressly withdrawn. Consequently, the same 
conditions that existed in 1798 prevailed again in several cantons. 
Dissatisfaction gradually spread, and democracy and acknowledgment of the 
people’s rights were set against aristocratic rule. This movement, not always 
subsiding without bloodshed (Putsche), led to progressive development in most of 
the cantons since 1830, and finally, in 1848, to a new constitution. 
19. The federal constitution of 1848 and 1874.—The federal constitution of 1848 
marks an epoch in the interior relations of Switzerland. This constitution made 
Switzerland a union after the model of the United States of America. The year 
1874 marked the adoption of a new federal constitution, which was more an enlarge- 
ment than a complete change of the one of 1848. Since 1874 several articles have 
been amended or supplemented. 
B.—FOouUNDATIONS OF THE LEGAL ORDER IN SWITZERLAND. 
20. In general.—The foundations of the legal order in Switzerland are partly 
national laws and partly cantonal laws and customs. 
The laws of the confederation are unconditionally paramount to the cantonal 
lawsand customs. A national law of itself neutralizes all contradictory cantonal 
laws and prescriptions. The constitution, the basis of political action, is one of 
the laws. Besides the laws there are important ordinances and regulations for 
carrying them out. The political treaties between Switzerland and foreign coun- 
tries, or among the cantons themselves, have the same force as laws. 
21. Foundations of national law.—The chief foundation of Swiss legal order is 
the federal constitution of 1874, with later amendments and additions. 
Only those laws are national which have gone into effect since 1848; provided 
they have not been annulled or replaced.
-P-A-G-E-318
238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The numerous political treaties between Switzerland and foreign countries have 
similar significance. 
22. The foundations of cantonal laws are the cantonal constitutions, laws, and 
ordinances since 1803, in so far as they have not been annulled or replaced. 
The political treaties among cantons (concordats) formerly in force for the better 
enactment of laws were, at one time, of importance; later federal laws have 
rendered them superfiuous. In some cantons legislation is not complete; old cus- 
toms hold good to the same extent as statutes in some fields of the law. 
Cantonal constitutions, laws, ordinances, and customs are valid only when they 
are not contradictory to the Federal constitution, national laws, resolutions, and 
ordinances, or a national political treaty. 
C.—NATURE OF THE Swiss STATE. 
1—CONFEDERATION AND CANTONS. 
  23, Relation of the confederation to the eantons.—The confederation is a State 
consisting of 22 or, reckoning half cantons, 25 separate States. The distinction 
between the confederation as a State and the cantons as parts of that State does 
not refer to territory and population. Both of these are common to the confeder- 
ation and the cantons. The distinction lies in legislation, administration, and 
jurisdiction. The confederation has its definite attributes, and where these main- 
tain cantons are subordinate. When cantons are not restricted by the confedera- 
tion, they are sovereign. Relations with foreign countries are determined by the 
confederation. It has the right to declare war and peace and negotiate contracts 
and political treaties, as well as customs and duties, acts and commercial treaties 
with foreign countries. It is only in exceptional cases that cantons, under super- 
vision of the confederation, can negotiate treaties with foreign powers on subjects 
of minor importance, as, for instance, fishing in boundary waters. 
24. Protection of the cantons by the confederation.—The confederation protects 
the cantons, their province, constitution, and officials. It also protects individual 
citizens against aggressions of cantonal officials. The confederation has a right 
to interpose when interior order and peace are disturbed (federal intervention). 
25. Guaranty of cantonal constitutions.—Cantons must submit their constitu- 
tions to the confederate convention for approval, which is given only when the 
constitution in question throughout supports federal rights; is republican, i. e., 
invests the people themselves or their representatives with the highest power, and 
may at any time be revised when an increase of citizens so demands, 
2.—CITIZENSHIP IN SWITZERLAND CANTONS AND TOWNS. 
26. In general.—Swiss citizenship is the state of being vested with the rights and 
privileges of a Swiss citizen. Every citizen of a canton isa citizen of Switzer- 
land. No one can be a citizen of Switzerland without enjoying the rights of can- 
tonal citizenship. The latter is combined with town citizenship. 
Swiss citizenship is not limited by time, no matter how long a Swiss may reside 
inaforeign country. Cantons have not the right to banish their citizens or deprive 
them of citizenship. 
27. Acquisition of Swiss citizenship.—Citizenship is hereditary. Children of 
Swiss citizens are citizens of Switzerland, even though they may have been born 
in a foreign country. Foreigners become citizens by naturalization. To be nat- 
uralized, an applicant must have lived at least two years in Switzerland, and be 
no longer subject to enlistment; the grant of naturalization must be obtained 
from the Administrative Federal Council; enfranchisement takes place when a 
canton bestows citizenship upon the applicant. This is done only after he has 
been assured of communal citizenship.
-P-A-G-E-319
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 239 
28. Forfeiture of citizenship.—The rights of a Swiss citizen, and thereby those of 
a Canton or town, are forfeited only by residence in a foreign country and by appli- 
cation for the naturalization of a citizen and his family elsewhere. At the death 
of the father, a family can apply for readmittance as citizens of Switzerland. 
29. Citizenship in. Cantons and towns.—Anyone can be invested with citizenship 
in another Canton, provided that he has been naturalized in a particular place of 
that Canton. In this case he can retain or renounce his rights. as a citizen of the 
Canton and town which he has left. It sometimes happens that a person desires 
naturalization merely in:a different town of his native Canton. In most Cantons 
communities are: obliged, under fine, to invest with citizenship cantonal citizens 
living within the community. 
3.—RESIDENCE, ABODE, SOJOURNMENT. 
30. A residence or domicile is the place where a person intends: to dwell perma- 
nently. A person can have but one place of residence. Temporary absence does 
not change his residence. A change.of location, with the intention of permanently 
dwelling elsewhere, removes residence from one place to another. Residence is 
of the greatest importance, as citizens are subject to the laws of residence, and are 
accordingly taxed and summoned before court (civil domicile). 
31. Abode and sojournment.—These terms apply to the place where certificates 
of citizenship are delivered. This place regulates the exercise of political rights 
(political domicile). Abode and residence, therefore, have different meanings 
under different circumstances. The distinction between abode and sojournment 
is not defined by federal, but by cantonal, law. As a rule, servants, journeymen, 
and students are considered merely sojourners. 
4.-RELATION OF THE CANTONS TO ONE ANOTHER. 
  82. In general.—Cantons can not form separate leagues among themselves, but 
can negotiate treaties on the subjects of legislation, jurisdiction, and adminis- 
tration. If one Canton has been wronged by another, it must withhold all self- 
redress and abide by the decision of the Federal court. 
33. Uniform treatment of citizens of other Cantons.—No Canton has the right 
to treat citizens of other Cantons more unfavorably than its own. 
The resident of any Canton, together with his family, is subject to its laws, and 
can not appeal to the legislation of his native Canton, excepting in cases of wills 
and improvement or maintenance of family possessions. Cantons can not tax a 
temporary resident who is a. Swiss citizen for what he already pays taxes on in 
a different Canton. Cantons must care for poor, sick strangers, as for their own 
citizens, and must provide decent burial in case of death. The courts of one 
Canton can not decide the claims of anyone who is a resident of another Canton. 
84. Extradition treaties.—Cantons are bound to mutual assistance in delivering 
fugitives from justice, or punishing them, by carrying into effect the sentences 
passed upon them in other Cantons. 
IIl.—ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE. 
A.—In GINERAL. 
85. Kinds of boards.—The State is so organized that boards are established for 
the direction and regulation of affairs. According to their chief duty, they are 
distinguished as boards of legislation, government, administration, and juris- 
diction. 
Several persons or one individual may constitute a board; in the first case it is 
a collegiate board; in the latter an individual board. The highest power of the 
Confederation, as well as of the Cantons, is vested in collegiate boards.
-P-A-G-E-320
240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Members of boards, in so far as they have a defined professional capacity, are 
called officials. Their assistants are placemen. 
36. Competence.—Every board has its definite duties and qualifications, known 
as its competence. The question may arise whether a case belongs to the compe- 
tence of this or that board. Such a state of affairs is known as disagreement in 
competence. 
87. Duties of boards.—It is the duty of members of boards and their subordi- 
nates to fulfill their obligations conscientiously, They generally swear the oath 
of office, or a vow. Officers and their subordinates are responsible for their 
administration. Those in power over them can depose or punish them for a vio- 
lation of duty. If they have wronged anyone, they must yield indemnity. Should 
they be guilty of a penal act, they are judged by the criminal court. 
38. The official language.—The three national languages—German, French, and 
Italian—are permitted in interviewing State officers. In the Cantons it depends 
upon which language is predominant; in some there are two official languages. 
39. Places where boards meet.—Boards meet within the territory under their 
control and where they act officially. The seat of Federal boards, with the excep- 
tion of the Federal court, is Berne. Lausanne is the seat of the Federal court. 
Cantonal boards meet in the chief towns of the Cantons; district boards in the 
chief towns of the districts. 
40. The official press.—The acts and laws of the above boards are made known 
to inferior boards and the people through the official press and official collections of 
* laws. The Confederation has several official organs—the Federalist (Bundesblatt), 
the Official Trade Journal (Handelsamtsblatt), the Army Record (Militirverord- 
nungsblatt), etc. 
B,—FEDERAL BOARDS AND OFFICERS. 
  1,—THE FEDERAL CONVENTION. 
A.—JIn general. 
41. The two-chamber system.—The Federal convention consists of two chambers, 
divisions, or councils—the National Council and the State Council. The National 
Council represents the people of Switzerland in general; the State Council repre- 
sents the Cantons. 
42. Procedure.—Each division of the Federal Convention manages affairs spe- 
cially, excepting in certain cases when both chambers unite. Both councils meet 
at the same time in Berne. Sessions open in regular order the first Monday in 
June. The convention may assemble any time during the year, as necessity 
demands; it always meets for a several weeks’ session during December. Neither 
council can adjourn or close its sessions unless the other does likewise. 
The Administrative Federal Council defines the subjects for discussion and 
calls the councils to session. The presidents of both councils agree as to which 
chamber shall have priority in first discussing a certain affair; this agreement is 
submitted to their councils for confirmation. After a subject has been discussed 
in one council, it is referred to the other. If both chambers agree on all points, 
the question is decided; should objection be raised, the question is again referred 
to the first council. This action continues until the question is either decided by 
the agreement of both chambers or falls to the ground. The members of both 
councils have a free vote. Majority decides in all cases, though at least half of 
the members must be present to constitute a quorum. 
The common session of both councils, with the president of the National Council 
as chairman, is called the Joint Federal Convention. It is called only to decide 
elections for the Federal Convention (the federal council, the federal court, the 
office of general), to exercise pardoning power, and to decide disagreements in 
competence between federal boards. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 241 
B.—The separate councils. 
43. The National Council.—The National Council is elected by the people. One 
delegate is elected from every 20,000 inhabitants; a fractional number greater 
than 10,000 is likewise entitled to a delegate. Every canton and every half can- 
ton can elect at least one delegate. Federal legislation divides the larger cantons 
into electoral districts. The term of office in the National Council is three years. 
An entire change of membership occurs every three years on the last Sunday in 
October. 
Every Swiss layman who has the right to vote is eligible to membership. The 
same person can not be a member of the National or State Councils and a federal 
officer at the same time. Members draw a salary of 20 francs per day; their tray- 
eling expenses are paid out of the public treasury. The president of the council 
can not hold office for more than one year. 
44, The State Council.—This council consists of delegates from the cantons, 44 
innumber. Every canton elects 2 delegates, every half canton 1 delegate. Can- 
tons are free to act in the manner of election. In some cantons members are 
elected by representatives of the people (cantonal council, great council); in 
others, by the people themselves. The cantons likewise decide upon the length of 
term and the salaries to be paid out of the public treasury. The president is 
elected for one year; the president of the ensuing year must be chosen from the 
delegates of another canton. 
2—THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEDERAL COUNCIL AND FEDERAL OFFICERS. 
45. The Administrative Federal Council._—The Administrative Federal Council 
is the board of government of Switzerland, and is the highest executive and 
administrative power. It consists of seven members chosen for three years from 
among the members of the Federal Convention. Election is confirmed by the 
Federal Convention after the entire change of membership in the National Council 
during the December session; the term of office begins with the first of the follow- 
ing January. Only one member can be elected from among the voting citizens of 
one canton. A president acts as chairman, he has the title of president of the 
confederation, but he is not the president of the Republic as in France or in the 
United States. The president has no greater competences than the other members, 
He is chosen by the Federal Convention for one year, and is not eligible to the 
presidency or vice-presidency during the ensuing year. Every member is at the 
head of an administrative or executive department. The different departments 
are those of exterior, interior, justice and police, army, finances and taxes, indus- 
try, agriculture and trade, mail and railroads. 
46. Federal court of chancery.—The Federal Council is assisted by the chancery, 
which attends to protocols and the carrying out of resolutions of the Federal 
Council and the Federal Convention, the keeping of the archives, the registry, 
and translation and publication of resolutions and laws; it is, in fact, charged 
with the superintendence of all affairs of chancery of the Federal Council and the 
Federal Convention. The head of this office bears the title of chancellor; he is 
elected for three years by the Federal Convention at the same time as the Federal 
Council. His occupation isto authenticate. He is assisted by two representatives 
(vice-chancellors) and the necessary officers and place men. 
47. Federal officers.—All federal officers, excepting the chancellor, the general 
members of the federal court, and its court of chancery, are elected by the National 
Council for a term of three years. Officers are distinguished as assistants and 
placemen. The Federal Council has the right to associate men of the learned pro- 
fessions.

    242 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
3.-THE FEDERAL COURT OF LAW. 
48. Constitution.—The federal court has been established for the exercise of 
judicial power as it pertains to the confederation. The number of members is 
determined by law, according to necessity ;-at present there are 16 members and 9 
substitutes. They are elected for six years by the Federal Convention. In their 
election the three national languages are taken intoconsideration. Every voting 
citizen is eligible to membership. The court chooses its clerks. As it would be 
impracticable for the entire federal court to meet for all cases, different divisions 
transact different classes of affairs. 
49. Confederate assizes.—There is also a confederate court of assizes. Every 
six years cantons elect their jurymen. When the court of assizes meets, the 
necessary number of jurymen are selected. The court of assizes is under the 
superintendence of the federal court. 
C.—Cantonal boards and officers. 
50. Representations of the people.—The highest cantonal power is vested in the 
cantonal council, also called great council or district council. It consists of dele- 
gates elected by the people, and transacts affairs of greater importance. Some 
cantons also have a communal council, of which any voting citizen may be a 
member, 
51. Governments.—Cantons are governed by what is called a Government or 
State council. It consists of several members elected either by the people or the 
cantonal council. 
52. Officers.—Officers are elected by the Government, the cantonal council, or 
the people. There are cantonal or district, town, and communal officers. 
53. Courts.—Cantons have a superior court—called also cantonal court or court 
of appeals—district courts, or courts of justice, and besides criminal courts, or 
courts of assizes. In some cantons commercial courts are established to settle 
disputes in trade. Here and there industrial courts of arbitration are established 
to settle disputes between manufacturers and their clerks, hands, and apprentices. 
Throughout many cantons, moreover, justices of the peace decide minor cases 
and settle disputes. 
D.—Political rights (people's rights). 
54. In general.—The people cooperate in the administration and regulation of 
affairs of State as well as in legislation and elections. The rights of the people to 
cooperate in administration are called people’s rights; the rights of individual 
citizens political rights, which consist of vote and eligibility to office. The State is 
divided into electoral districts, Elections are decided by majority or a relative or 
proportional vote, which latter method is affected by party numbers. 
55. Vote and eligibility to ofjice.—Every citizen above 20 years of age has a right 
to vote. Cantons can disenfranchise those under punishment of the law, bank- 
rupts, those whose goods are distrained, paupers, and those under guardianship. 
56. The confederate vote.—In confederate elections anyone can vote where he 
resides, and at once after he has delivered his certificate of citizenship. Registra- 
tions can not be closed earlier than three days before the time of election. No one 
can vote in two places at one election. 
57. Voting in the cantons.—Every citizen of Switzerland can take part in the 
affairs of the canton and community in which he is, providing he has been living 
there for three months. Cantons, however, have the right to object to the voting 
of a three-months’ resident, and can exact a longer time from mere sojourners 
(journeymen, servants, etc.). The right of vote in communities refers to political 
communities. In affairs purely civil and religious, only those can have a voice who 
belone to the civil or parochial district in question.

THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 
IV.—LEGISLATION. 
A.—LEGISLATION IN GENERAL. 
  58. The law.—The law is the order of the State, to which officers and citizens 
must conform to avoid unpleasant results. The most important law, also called 
the fundamental law, is the constitution. Prescriptions, orders, decisions, and 
regulations, as well as signed political treaties, have the same effect as laws. 
59. Legislation.—The constitution defines with exactness who, in every State, 
has the power to carry laws, decisions, and prescriptions into effect. Laws are 
first deliberated and then enacted. For the making of a law the decisions of several 
boards, or of one board and the people, are necessary. To be effective, laws must 
be made known to officers and the people. For this reason they are printed and 
published. 
B.—FEDERAL LEGISLATION, 
1—THE CONSTITUTION. 
60. Total revision.—A. total revision of the federal constitution implies that 
every article is deliberated and a new constitution framed. The Federal Council 
or any single member of the Federal Convention can make a motion for total 
revision. If both chambers agree to the proposition, the question is deliberated. 
If one chamber agrees and the other dissents, a national vote decides, If an 
application for total revision has 50,000 signatures, the Federal Council must call 
a national vote. If the people decide in favor of it, both councils are renewed, 
and the newly elected councils must deliberate a new constitution, which is sub- 
mitted to the people. 
The revision agreed upon by the Federal Convention is submitted to the people. 
The new constitution is accepted, if the majority of voters and the majority of 
cantons are agreed. 
61. Partial revision.—Partial revision implies the amendment of single articles 
of the federal constitution or the adoption of new articles only. The motion can 
be made by the Federal Council or by any member of the Federal Convention. 
If in this case only one council agrees, no national vote follows. The question 
simply falls to the ground. If both chambers agree upon partial revision, the 
new article is submitted to the vote of the people, and is accepted if the majority 
of voters and the majority of cantons are in favor. 
The people can demand a partial revision directly by initiative. Fifty thousand 
signatures to an application necessitates the calling of a national vote on a pro- 
posed article. The Federal Convention can at the same time submit a counter 
proposition to the vote of the people.    
2.—LAWS AND RESOLUTIONS. 
62. Kinds.—The federal constitution distinguishes between laws and resolu- 
tions. Laws are more permanent; resolutions are temporary.’ They are gener- 
ally or not generally binding, in so far as they apply to general or special conditions, 
Resolutions on the payments of money are not considered generally binding. 
68. Referendum.—Laws and resolutions are enacted by the Federal Convention. 
As a national vote must always take place for a total revision of the federal con- 
stitution, as well as for an amendment or adoption of articles, in case of laws and 
resolutions it is called only when 30,000 inhabitants or 8 cantons so demand (fac- 
ultative referendum). In voting on the constitution, a majority of voters and 
cantons is necessary for decision; on laws and resolutions a majority of voters 
suflices. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
A referendum can not be had in cases of resolutions declared urgent though 
not generally binding, no more than in cases of political treaties (treaties with 
other States) ratified by the Federal Convention. 
3.—PRESCRIPTIONS AND REGULATIONS. 
64, Significance.—Laws are sometimes limited to the establishment of funda- 
menial principles, and themselves provide to dispose details by means of prescrip- 
tions and regulations. These prescriptions and regulations must be definitely 
within the bounds of the law, of which they are but a closer application. 
65. Competence.—The Federal Council is empowered to enact prescriptions and 
regulations. The federal court has the right of jurisdiction over debt and 
bankruptcy. 
C.—CANTONAL LEGISLATION. 
66. Constitution.—The constitutions of cantons, as well as amendments, are 
generally discussed and decided by representatives of the people (cantonal 
council, great council, district council). In some cantons a special committee, 
the committee on constitution, is elected for the sole purpose of totally revising the 
constitution. All new constitutions and amendments must, in accordance with 
the federal constitution, be submitted to the people for acceptance. Revised 
constitutions must, moreover, receive the consent of the Federal Convention. In 
many cantons the same right prevails as in the confederacy, that a number of 
qualified voters may claim a revision or a change in a specified point (constitu- 
tional initiative). 
67. Laws.—In all cantons laws are primarily discussed and established by 
representatives of the people. In most cantons they are also submitted to popular 
vote (obligatory referendum). In some cantons a popular vote is called only when 
a certain number of qualified voters so demand (faculty referendum). In afew 
cantons the right obtains for a number of qualified voters to demand the enact- 
ment of a certain law or amendment (legal initiative). A few cantons have as 
yet no legal appeal (Freiburg, Wallis). 
68. Prescriptions.—Cantonal governments have the right to enact prescriptions 
for the carrying out of laws. 
V.—ADMINISTRATION. 
A.—GOVERNMENT. 
69, Federal government.—The Federal Council is the administrative head of 
Switzerland. It provides for the execution of the constitution and other laws, 
and gives the necessary directions. It prepares all the requisites for the Federal 
Convention. It protects the interests of the confederacy from without and guards 
interior security. The whole administration of the confederacy is in its hands. 
70. The governments of cantons likewise administer interior affairs, dispose the 
requisites for a proper execution of the constitution and other laws, maintain 
peace and order,and direct and superintend the whole administration of State. 
They have no direct intercourse with foreign governments, but must solicit the 
mediation of the Federal Council. 
B.—FINANCIAL SYSTEM, 
71. Federal financial administration.—As finances affect the well-being of the 
whole State, their proper management becomes the first duty of the State. Ex- 
penses and receipts are determined a year in advance by means of specifications. 
The budget is prepared by the Federal Council, and submitted to the approval of 
the Federal Convention. All demands of the Federal Council must be indorsed
-P-A-G-E-325
         THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 245 
  by the Federal Convention (additional credits). A member of the Federal Coun- 
cil is at the head of the department of finances. The chief receipts consistin duties. 
The postal and telegraph service also yield an income to the State. A direct tax 
is not levied by federal authority. The Federal Council turns in an annual 
account. This public account must be approved by the Federal Convention. The 
confederacy alone has the right to impose duties, arrange postal matters, and 
superintend the telegraph and telephone. Such rights are called monopolies or 
regalia. The production of alcohol is also a federal monopoly, from which, how- 
ever, cantons receive some benefit. 
72. Financial administration in the cantons.—In cantons, likewise, a yearly 
budget is laid before the representatives of the people for approval. The state- 
ment of public accounts likewise requires the approval of these authorities. Here 
and there a resolution of the people is necessary to incur greater expenses. The 
receipts of cantons are derived from dues which officers receive for functions 
(indirect taxes), or from direct taxation of property and income of the popula- 
tion. Frequently individuals are taxed without respect to possessions and profits 
(capital and household tax). As individuals of means can do more, even irre- 
spective of their possessions, than the poor, the more recent tax laws are nearly 
all based upon the principle of progression. Inheritances are also taxed; in many 
places there still exists a stamp tax. Cantons can not levy duties or exact toll. 
The profits of the alcohol monopoly are divided among the cantons with respect 
to population; 10 per cent must be spent on the temperance cause (alcohol tithe). 
Cantons likewise receive one-half of the military tax for nonenlistment. Most 
cantons have made a monopoly of the salt traffic—that is to say, the canton alone 
has the right to introduce salt and control the market. 
C.—THE. MILITARY SYSTEM. 
73. Nature of the Swiss military system.—The military system of Switzerland is 
based upon the militia system. There are no standing regular troops, but every 
citizen is required to engage in actual service when summoned. If he is prevented 
ty or any other cause, he must pay a military tax. The militia 
is a federal affair; cantons have hardly a voice in the matter. 
74. The Swiss army.—The Swiss army is composed of the marching division, the 
landwehr, and the landsturm. The younger reserves belong to the marching divi- 
sion; the older to the landwehr. Such citizens as have never performed military 
service also belong tothe landsturm. The Swiss army is locally divided into eight 
divisions. It has special laws for crimes and misdemeanors committed in service 
(military jurisprudence). In case of war the Federal Convention elects a com- 
mander-in-chief (general), whose powers are withdrawn at the close of the war. 
    D.—EDUCATION. 
75. In general.—Every State must fulfill the important duty of properly educat- 
ing its citizens, that they may maintain a position in the battle of life. Schools are 
divided into people’s schools, secondary and higher schools. Cantons are obliged 
by the federal constitution to provide adequate primary instruction, which is com- 
pulsory. Children of a certain age are obliged to receive instruction, which must 
be so arranged that all of whatever creed they may be may benefit by it. 
76. Federal action.—In accordance with the present constitution, the Federal 
Government pays little attention to educational matters. It supports the poly- 
technic school in Zurich, and has the right to found a confederate university, 
not yet begun. The Government allows appropriations for industrial, commer- 
cial, and agricultural schools and for schools of domestic economy. 
77. Activity in the. cantons.—Outside of what is done by the Federal Govern- 
ment, the cantons bear the whole burden of educational affairs. Single commu-            
   
-P-A-G-E-326
  246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
nities, or several smaller communities together, have one or more primary schools. 
Besides these there are general and technical continuation schools, district schools, 
classical and modern high schools, and universities. 
E.—THE PuBiic Goon, 
78. In general.—As it is the duty of a State to promote the welfare of its citizens 
in every respect, the care of the public good embraces the various subjects of 
advancement of political economy, protection of the laboring class, promotion of 
health, preservation of nature, and encouragement of art and science. 
79. Advancement of political economy.—The State is in duty bound to advance 
political economy; it should encourage production, trade, and commerce to the 
full extent of its power. For this reason, it endeavors to elevate the standing of 
the people by supporting expositions, by granting bounties for agriculture (sub- 
ventions), by facilitating trade by means of uniform coins and measures, by finan- 
cial aid in building dams, by encouraging industries through premiums, exposi- 
tions, and elevation of apprenticeship, etc. The mail, telegraph, and telephone 
service should be managed for public benefit only; the question is being agitated 
to bring railways under federal control and to manage them for public interest. 
For the promotion of industry, inventions are protected by patent rights; manu- 
factures are protected by trade-marks. 
The importance of the different divisions of political economy has led to a dis- 
tribution of administrative power among the departments of industry, agriculture, 
and trade, mail, telegraph, and railways. The same departments exist in the 
cantons. 
80. Protection of the laboring class.—The State lends its support to the laborer 
so that he is better able to earn a livelihood. The wage earner needs the State's 
protection. Legislation for the benefit of the laborer is called labor laws. These 
apply to superintendence of factories in respect to hygiene, limitation of time, 
particularly during the night and on Sundays and holidays, prohibition of child- 
labor, and indemnity in cases of accident. The motion has been made to institute 
State benefits for the sick, etc. 
81. Promotion of health.—lt is primarily the duty of the individual to care for 
his health, but the State must assist. 
The confederation takes precautionary measures against dangerous contagious 
diseases, so-called epidemics, as typhoid, cholera, smallpox, etc., and against epi- 
demics among animals. Cantons are required to promote the public health by 
educating physicians, erecting hospitals and insane asylums, by free medical 
attendance and nursing of the sick, by superintendence of food, and severe meas- 
ures against adulterations. 
The communities extend the amplest means for preserving health by furnishing 
proper attendance in cases of sickness and accidents, by caring for the sick poor 
without pay, by furnishing good drinking water and discharging all injurious 
matter, by a strict superintendence of food, ete. 
82. Preservation of nature.—It is well known how significant climate and soil 
are for the well-being of a population. Because of their important relations to 
weather, forests should be protected first in order; therefore, they and moun- 
tain waters are under the supervision of the confederation. Generally a special 
department in the cantons has charge of preserving forests. A special legislation 
and supervision obtains for the protection of fish, birds, and other game, as 
much for sparing the animals themselves as for the benefit which man derives 
from them. 
83. Encouragement of art and scienee.—Art and science should receive attention 
from a nation; therefore a State should do all in its power to encourage them by 
establishing public collections and libraries, by purchasing works of art, etc.
-P-A-G-E-327
  THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 247 
84. Expropriation.—The State recognizes the property of an individual from 
principle and protects it against unjust seizure. But when the public good 
demands it, as in the construction of public buildings, railways, canals, and reser- 
voirs, the individual must give up his property, even against his will (expro- 
priation, condemnation). : 
F.—OTHER BRANCHES OF ADMINISTRATION. 
85. Justice.—The department of justice prepares laws relating to penalty and 
private rights; it superintends all judiciary action, and proposes measures for 
improvements and remedying evils; it decides questions of complaints rendered, 
and supervises the civil and commercial register. The confederation and individ- 
ual cantons here:separate the departments of justice. 
86. Police.—The department of police protects individuals and possessions. The 
police must see that strangers threatening the security of the State from without 
or within quit the country, and that criminals are brought tolaw. The confed- 
eration and cantons have separate departments of police. Communities must 
provide a proper police force. The fire police is a community affair. 
87. Poor laws.—The maintenance of the poor is particularly a cantonal affair, 
which is transacted by communities. Different arrangements exist for the sup- 
port of the poor. In some cantons the needy are provided for by the canton in 
which they live (local support); in others their support is an affair of their native 
community. In cases of extreme necessity, however, the community in which 
they live must provide temporary relief, and burial in case of death. 
88. Guardianship.—The laws of guardianship are cantonal affairs, primarily 
administered by communities. In every canton there exist supervisory boards. 
89. Communities.—The supervision and administration of communities is under 
the cantonal governments, which have special departments for this purpose (the 
interior). 
VI.—RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF INDIVIDUALS. 
A.—INDIVIDUALS. 
90. Personality.—Every inhabitant, be he an adult or child, is capacitated for 
rights and duties; consequently, everyone is qualified to be under law; but rights 
and duties belong to a number of persons forming a collective unit under a special 
name, as, for instance, communities, societies, guilds, and unions. So we speak 
of them as individuals by law. 
91. Independent action.—Even though rights and duties belong to mankind in 
general, not everyone is able himself to acquire and establish them. The ability 
to do so, called independent action, begins at the close of the twentieth year of 
age, the time of legal maturity. Minors are bound to the consent of parents and 
guardians. When those of age are under guardianship, because of mental or 
physical incapacity, they are deprived of independent action. It is evident that 
the insane are incapable of acting legally. In some cantons minors above 18 years 
of age can execute wills. 
Political rights, the right to vote, and eligibility to public office begin with the 
completion of the twentieth year of age. 
92. Responsibility for injuries.—Anyone, in so far as he is accountable, is 
responsible for an intentional injury to others or one that results from negligence. 
Accountability is a question of age and intellectual ability. It may begin as early 
as the twelfth year of age; with undeveloped children it begins later. After con- 
sideration of all circumstances, the judge decides the question of accountability. 
The responsibility for forbidden acts is twofold. On the one hand damages are 
repaired by money, and on the other hand, if the act is forbidden by statute, the 
culprit is also punished.
-P-A-G-E-328
  248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  93. Representatives of individuals.—Incapacitated persons need a legal repre- 
sentative, who, when necessary, acts for them. <A father, or, if he be dead, amother 
or guardian, is a legal representative. Individuals by law likewise have their 
representatives (administrators, directors, etc.). A power of attorney gives one 
person the right to act in the place of another. Political rights alone are not 
transferable. 
94. Sea.—With rights and duties, no distinction is made between the sexes, 
Political rights form an exception. Women are not allowed to vote, and are not 
eligible to public office. 
95. Merchants.—A merchant is one who carries on, or controls the management 
of, a commercial or manufacturing business. Merchants must be enrolled in the 
commercial register. They are subject to bankrupt laws for debt. 
96. The civil register.—The relations of a person with respect to birth and name 
determine his civil position, which is recorded in the civil register. In recording 
births, the Christian name and surname, the names of parents, and place of birth 
must be mentioned. Deaths are similarly registered. Marriages are likewise 
recorded, 
97. The commercial register is kept for the purpose of acquainting the public 
with the formation and representation of mercantile firms, that they may have 
full confidence in the statements given. 
B.—PusLic RIGHTS AND DUTIES. 
98. Summary.—Public rights and duties are those of individual citizens with 
respect to State authority. They are defined principally by the federal constitu- 
tion; some are guaranteed by the cantonal constitutions. Public rights, also called 
individual rights or rights of liberty, are a claim to equality before the law, free 
residence, the liberty to engage in any industrial or commercial pursuit, the 
liberty of petition, the liberty of union, the liberty of the press, free worship, 
liberty of conscience, and the political rights already mentioned. Public duties 
are enlistment in military service and payment of taxes. 
99. Equality before the law.—All citizens are equal before the law; no distinc- 
tions can exist that wound republican feeling. Everyone has the right not to be 
treated arbitrarily and to have his cause heard by State authorities. 
100. Residence.—One of the most important liberties is the right of free settle- 
ment. Every citizen may live where he pleases, provided he have a certificate 
showing that he is a native of Switzerland. The right of residence can be refused 
or withdrawn only for bad conduct or dependence upon public charity. 
101. The liberty of industrial and commercial pursuits.—Fundamentally, every- 
one can engage in any industry according to pleasure. Formerly, in the time of 
guilds, things were different. The liquor traffic forms an exception. Thisindus- 
try is dependent upon a permission (license or concession) which is given only in 
necessity and upon the receipt of proofs for definite requirements. Other indus- 
tries are subject to certain restrictions, as pharmacy and the manufacture of 
inflammable and poisonous substances; just so the practice of certain professions, 
as those of lawyers, physicians, and teachers, are dependent upon certificates. 
102. Theliberty of petition, of union, of assembly, and of the press.—Every citizen 
is allowed to refer a proper cause to State officers (the liberty of petition). Citizens 
are likewise allowed to form unions, even political, which are forbidden in mon- 
archies (the liberty of union), and to call meetings at pleasure (the liberty of 
assembly). The liberty of the press consists in a free and candid expression of 
opinion, which, however, must incur no breach of honor, 
103. Free worship and liberty of conscience.—Free worship and liberty of con- 
science is one of the most beautiful and valuable principles. It consists in every- 
one’s being permitted to live up to his religious convictions without fear of perse- 
cution.

  THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 249 
C.—PrnaL Laws. 
104. In general.—Every State has laws the violation of which entails not only 
responsibility for the damage done but punishment also. According to their 
weight, punishable acts are crimes, offenses, or mere misdemeanors. Punishments 
are either losses of money or liberty. In some cantons, crimes exceptionally great, 
like murder, are punished by death. The severest forms of loss of liberty are the 
penitentiary or incarceration, the workhouse or imprisonment. The instigators 
and accomplices are punished as well as the perpetrators of a crime. Punishment 
naturally presupposes accountability. Whoever acts out of self-defense is exempt 
from punishment; the transgression, however, is punishable. Ifa guilty party 
has not been prosecuted during a certain length of time, the punishment of the 
offense is prescriptive. The penal prescriptions are contained in several of the 
federal laws, but principally in the cantonal penal-law books. The confederation 
has penal prescriptions for crimes against the confederation and confederate 
authorities, as well as for transgressions against federal decrees. Cantons define 
the prescriptions for other crimes, offenses, and transgressions. 
105. Crimes and offenses against the State and its officers.—High treason, namely, 
acts designed against the independence of the fatherland, is the greatest possible 
crime. Other crimes are unjust attacks on State authority, disobedience against 
official commands, ete. 
106. Crimes and offenses against life and health.—The greatest crime in this 
respect is murder, which is the deliberate and intentional killing of anyone. 
Manslaughter is the killing of a man, possibly voluntarily, but without delibera- 
tion, in the heat of excitement. If a man be wounded without intent to kill and 
death results, it is called a wound of fatal issue. Corporal injuries are called 
wounds, They are divided into severe and light wounds. Only a mild punishment 
is given in cases of death or wounds inadvertently caused. 
107. Crimes and offenses against property.—The most frequent crime against 
property is theft—the unjust appropriation of another’s belongings. The value 
of the goods and the manner of perpetrating the theft affect the culpability of the 
act. Housebreaking, entering premises, and the use of weapons aggravate the 
offense. If theft is committed by using force or threats, it is called robbery. 
Embezzlement is the appropriation to our own use of another's goods committed 
to us for safe-keeping. The acquisition of advantages by intentional deception is 
fraud. The gaining of advantages by threat is extortion. The destruction and 
injuring of goods (defacement) is likewise punished; its worst form is arson. 
Whoever buys or secretes goods which he knows or has reason to believe have 
been stolen is punished for the concealment of stolen goods. Counterfeiting 
money and falsifying titles are also crimes against property. 
108. Crimes and offenses against honor and morality.—Calumny is an inten- 
tional harm done to another’s honor or credit by false reports. Insults are expres- 
sions against anyone’s honor. Immoral actions are punished by law. 
109. Other offenses and transgressions.—Besides what have been mentioned, 
there are a number of prescriptions, the violation of which entails punishment. 
Various penal decrees relate to food, the chase, fishing, etc. There is hardly a 
law that does not contain some penal decree. 
D.—Civin Laws. 
110. Introduction.—Civil laws, also called common laws, include the relations 
of the citizen with respect to family and possessions and determine the rights and 
duties which proceed from the family and intercourse. Civil laws are divided 
into laws of family, laws of goods, laws of obligations, and laws of inheritance. 
Almost all but the laws of obligations are defined by cantonal legislation. The 
laws of obligations are included in a special federal law.
-P-A-G-E-330
    250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
111. The laws of family.—The family consists of parents and their issue. It is 
founded by the making of marriage vows. For a marriage to be legal the groom 
must be 18 years and the bride 16 years of age. Minors must have the consent of 
their legal representatives. Mental disease, an already existing marriage, close 
relationship, or affinity by marriage are obstructions. Before the marriage is 
confirmed it must be announced by the civil officer; afterwards the religious 
ceremony may take place. The marriage is annulled if hindrances exist—an 
existing marriage, relationship, etc. There can be a divorce on valid grounds. 
By marriage a woman enters upon a relation to her husband also with respect 
to her possessions; this is called the marital property relation. In most cantons 
the husband accordingly has the right to administer his wife’s possessions in so 
far as the wife has not reserved her right by contract. If the husband becomes 
bankrupt, his wife is a preferred creditor for the half of her possessions. 
Parents have the right, and it is their duty, to educate their children and pro- 
vide for them. It is the duty of children to care for their poor parents. In some 
cantons parents without children can adopt strange children. 
Guardians are appointed over orphans, as well as those of majority who need 
supervision on account of being spendthrifts or mentally or physically disabled. 
112. The laws of goods.—Goods are objects which belong to trade. They are 
movable or immovable; movable goods are called wares; immovable goods are 
grounds and buildings. Ownership implies the full legal right to goods. It is 
acquired by purchase, exchange, gift, inheritance, or long-continued possession 
(limitation). The right to use strange immovable goods, or render them sery- 
iceable in a definite direction, is called the right of service, as, for instance, the 
use of grounds, the right of roads, etc. If goods are held only as a security for a 
claim, the possessor is called a mortgagee. 
Whilst the exchange of movable goods is easily effected, the legal relations of 
fixed property are often defined with difficulty. For this reason the records 
(Grundbiicher) have been instituted, in which the titles of property are registered. 
118. Laws of obligations.—Obligations are responsibilities for debt. As a rule, 
they arise from contracts, as agreements for purchase, rent, lease, and service. 
They also arise from forbidden negotiations, whereby the one at fault becomes 
indebted for indemnification. Different forms of proofs for claims and debts, 
specially designed as evidence, are notes, bills of exchange, and checks. 
114. The laws of inheritance.—The possessions of anyone deceased fall to his 
relations; if there be no immediate family, they are divided among his brothers 
and sisters, or more distant relations. A man has the right to will his possessions 
at his own pleasure; his near relations, however, can not be totally ignored; they 
have the right to a certain legacy by law. If there areno near relations, and there 
is no will, the inheritance reverts to the communities or to the cantons. 
Vil.—THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM. 
A.—IN GENERAL. 
115. Duties of the judiciary department.—It does not suffice for State legislation 
to define rights; it must also provide for their maintenance and protection. This 
is done by the judiciary, whose power is primarily vested in the courts. The 
administrative power is also called upon to support rights in certain directions 
(administration of justice). 
116. Procedure.—The process in a lawsuit is a series of acts and investigations 
countenanced by the judiciary and superintended by a judge. The chief feature 
is the opportunity for expression given to both parties. The proceeding concludes 
with a decision or sentence. The sentence must then be carried out (execution). 
Accoréing to the rights to be protected, we distinguish the systems of public 
law, penal law, and civil law.
-P-A-G-E-331
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 251 
B,—TuE System or Pusiic Law. 
117. Disagreement in regard to public law.—Different State boards may differ in 
opinion on competences; or an individual citizen may feel that his public rights 
have been infringed upon. If boards have different views as regards their com- 
petences, we speak of disagreements in competences. If federal boards disagree, 
the Federal Convention decides; if the confederation and cantons, or the cantons 
themselves disagree, the federal court decides. The federal court or the Federal 
Council decide disagreements between citizens and federal boards. 
118. The right of appeal.—If a citizen believes that any public right granted 
to him by the federal or cantonal constitution has been infringed upon, he can 
hand in a writ of complaint against the offending board to the federal court (right 
of appeal). In cases of infringement on political rights and the liberties of com- 
merce and industry, the appeal must be made to the national council. 
C.—Sysrem or Prenat Law. 
119. The system of penal law in the Confederation.—The milder violations of 
penal decrees contained in federal laws are passed over to the cantonal courts of 
trial. Graver violations are tried by the federal court, which even acts in con- 
junction with the court of assizes for judging certain crimes, as high treason, 
rebellion, and violence against federal authority and political crimes and offenses 
that occasioned federal intervention. 
120. The system of penal law in the cantons.—The method of procedure in deter- 
mining crimes and offenses and judging the guilty is different in the different 
cantons. Milder cases are tried in the lower courts; graver cases, in the so-called 
criminal courts or courts of assizes. The charge is usually brought forward by 
the State’s attorney, a lawyer officially appointed, who founds the charge and 
decides upon a right of appeal to a higher court. The accused is allowed to have 
a defendant; in weighty cases he is provided with a defending attorney. 
121. System of military penal law.—A court-martial tries crimes and offenses 
committed in service, as has been already mentioned. Every division has a mili- 
tary court composed of officers and soldiers. 
D.—System or Civm Law, 
  122. System of civil law in the cantons.—Minor suits are usually settled by indi- 
vidual judges. Serious cases are taken before district courts (the first instance), 
and upon appeal of one party, to superior courts for sentence. The method of pro- 
cedure is not alike inallcantons. Insome cantons the parties deliver their charges 
and causes verbally; in others they must hand in writs of complaint and defense. 
123. The federal court in connection with civil law.—The federal court judges 
only certain cases of civil law. 
Certain suits can and must be brought directly before the federal court without 
consideration of cantonal courts. To this class belong civil suits between the con- 
federation and cantons or between cantons, independent of the worth of the cause; 
suits between private parties or corporations as plaintiffs and the confederation 
as accused, provided the cause of dispute is estimated at 3,000 francs at least, 
suits between a canton on the one hand and private parties or corporations on the 
other, provided the cause of dispute is valued at not less than 3,000 francs and 
one or the other party demands it; finally a series of suits affecting railways, 
so-called emission banks, patents of inventions, and telegraph and telephone lines. 
The federal court furthermore decides all cases that have been previously judged 
in cantonal courts from which an appeal has been made to the federal court. ‘An 
appeal can be granted only when the dispute is to be decided according to federal 
laws; therefore principally in cases of obligations and when the cause of dis- 
pute is valued at not less than 2,000 francs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
124, Prosecution for debt and bankruptcy.—If anyone has an indisputable claim; 
consequently a claim entitled to legal judgment or the proof of a debt, he can 
prosecute the one unwilling to pay for debt. If the debtor is mentioned in the 
commercial register, this action leads to bankruptcy; otherwise to distraint. In 
cases of distraint goods are taken and sold by auction until the sum of the claim 
has been realized. In bankruptcy, all the possessions of the debtor are sold at auc- 
tion, and all creditors invited to make good their claims. In distraint,as well as in 
bankruptcy, the most necessary articles must be left to the debtor. Prosecution 
for debt and bankruptcy are regulated by federal law. 
VIII.—PosiTION OF THE CONFEDERATION WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
  125. Summary.—The separate States or cantons can not act independently; it is 
a well-understood advantage for them and the population to foster their relations 
to one another. These relations can be of a political nature and be expressed in 
alliances with foreign States, or they can be directed to the friendly intercourse 
among the States by reciprocal ambassadors and consuls as well as by international 
treaties. 
126. Political situation of Switzerland.—Switzerland has always followed out 
the principle of not interfering with the political conditions of other States and 
strenuously maintaining a policy of neutrality- The neutral position of Switzer- 
land was defined by it, and the great powers of Europe, during the congress at 
Vienna in 1815, guaranteed it. In consequence of its strict neutrality, the confed- 
eration offers an asylum to all political fugitives, who are allowed to remain as 
long as they do not abuse the privilege. 
127. Ambassadors and consuls.—For the maintenance of the friendly relations 
existing between Switzerland and the larger States, as well as for the protection 
and assistance of Swiss residents, Switzerland sends ambassadors or ministers to 
Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and Washington. It sends consuls to all the impor- 
tant cities of the world. Their office is to transact business affairs and counsel and 
assist their fellow-citizens. On the other hand, foreign countries send ambassadors 
or ministers to Switzerland; in allits large cities foreign consuls reside. Ambassa- 
dors and their personnel enjoy the right of extraterritoriality—that is to say, their 
judicial relations are the same as in their own country (taxes, legal prosecutions, 
etc.). Consuls must be recognized by the Government of the country to which 
they are sent; this recognition is called “exequatur.” 
128. Treaties for residence and trade.—Treaties for residence exist between 
Switzerland and most other States. In accordance with these, Swiss citizens and 
the citizens of other States may reside in the respective countries and enjoy the 
protection of their laws. They can carry on business the same as native citizens, 
and can not be deprived of these rights without cause. 
129. Treaties on important matters of law.—It frequently happens that the legal 
prescriptions in one country might conflict with those of another. It is necessary 
to establish uniform legal prescriptions, especially for industry, trade intercourse, 
and legal proceedings, This is accomplished through the so-called international 
conventions. These have been held to decide upon postal, telegraph, railroad, 
freight, patent, and art and literary copyright laws. The States which have 
been represented at these conventions maintain special bureaus, so-called inter- 
national bureaus, located at Berne. 
130. Treaties referring to import duties.—States levy a duty on imported goods, 
partly for revenue and partly to raise the prices of such articles so that home 
industries may prosper (protective tariff), If the interests of every State were 
isolated, commerce would not only be prevented but be rendered practically 
impossible. Therefore, States endeavor to derive advantage from mutual conces- 
sions. Switzerland has signed treaties of this kind with all neighboring States.
-P-A-G-E-333
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 253 
131. Extradition treaties.—Criminals often try to evade justice by taking refuge 
in other countries. States have, therefore, negotiated treaties for the return of 
such fugitives. Political offenses are not included in these treaties; they are 
those which are not committed from motives of gain and the like, but to give 
expression to political views. Switzerland and most other countries do not return 
a citizen who has committed a crime in another country, but themselves inflict 
the punishment. 
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN FRANCE. 
  In the French elementary schools ‘‘ civil government” is a subject of 
study, and the topics to be treated are prescribed explicitly. The 
following outline is submitted as showing what isrequired. Children 
of the age of 7 to 9 years are made acquainted, by means of informal 
explanations in connection with reading, with words suggesting 
national ideas, as citizen, soldier, army, native country, community, 
department, nation, law, justice, public force. Children from 9 to 11 
years of age are given general notions of the organization of the State, 
the duties and rights of citizens, compulsory education, military sery- 
ice, taxation, universal suffrage, the community, the mayor and the 
municipal council, the department, the prefect and the general coun- 
cil, the State, legislative, executive, and judicial power. During the 
last two years of the course the teacher discusses more thoroughly 
the political, administrative, and judicial organization of France; 
the constitution; the President of the Republic; the Senate; the 
Chamber of Deputies; the law; departmental and communal admin- 
istration; the different authorities; civil and penal courts; the differ- 
ent degrees of instruction; public force; the army. 
In the superior elementary schools this course is extended to include 
elementary ideas of political economy: Elementary notions of civil 
law (the family and the civil state, the laws of property, inheritances, 
contracts) and of commercial law (merchants, commercial societies, 
bills of exchange, orders, checks); production of wealth; factors in 
production (material, labor, economy, capital, property); circulation 
and distribution of wealth (exchange, money, credit, wages, and inter- 
est); luxury; expenses of the State; taxes and the annual appropria- 
tions. 
In order to more clearly define the subject, particularly to show the 
terminology employed, an English version of a little text-book is here 
inserted which is used in the lower schools of France. Its author is 
M. 8. A. Nonus, inspector of elementary schools and officer of public 
instruction in France. 
I,—SocieTy—THE STATE, 
Man is a social being. The foundation of society is the family. 
Several families living in the same neighborhood form a commune; several 
communes, a canton; several cantons, an arrondissement, and several arrondisse- 
ments, a department—and the departments, collectively, form the State.
-P-A-G-E-334
254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
A State is a territory the inhabitants of which obey the same laws and recog- 
nize the same power, the same authorities—or, in a word, are under the same 
government. 
Il.—BrEneEFirs or Socizry. 
‘One man can do very little alone; uniting his efforts to those of others, he can 
accomplish great results.” 
We are indebted to society for— 
(1) Material advantages. We enjoy not only the fruit of our own labor, but 
also that of the labor of others. 
(2) Intellectual advantages. Were it not for society, man would remain in a 
state of ignorance, as upon each individual would be entailed the nearly impos- 
sible task of starting again at the very beginning of all that has been done. As 
it is, each profits by the efforts of all. Generations bequeath an intellectual 
inheritance to one another. This constitutes progress. 
(3) Moral advantages. Isolated from his fellow-creatures, man would become 
fierce, savage, and wicked. In contact with others, his manners soften and moral 
progress develops. 
III,—GovERNMENT—CONSTITUTION. 
Government is the collective powers that administer public authority. The 
constitution is the fundamental law of a State. It defines the form of govern- 
ment and the political rights of citizens. France is now ruled in accordance with 
the constitutional laws of 1875. 
The principal forms of government are monarchies and republics. In a mon- 
archy, be it a kingdom or an empire, the monarch exercises power as a personal 
right, transmitted by succession. When his authority is not limited by a consti- 
tution, the government is an absolute monarchy. When his authority is defined 
by a constitution, the government is said to be constitutional. 
The word republic means a public thing or affair—the government of all. A 
government is said to be democratic when the power resides ultimately in the 
whole people. 
Observation: France is a democratic Republic, one and indivisible. Switzer- 
land is a federative Republic, 
IV.—Monarcuy AND REPUBLIC—COMPARISON. 
A republic is the only form of government compatible with universal suffrage 
or national sovereignty. Itis preferable to a monarchy because the people con- 
duct their own affairs instead of submitting blindly to a man who is able to place 
his own interests and those of his dynasty above national interests. 
The heir of a good king may be incapable of governing; whereas the president 
of a republic is always elected from among the most able. 
Observation: In a republic men are free citizens, whilst in a monarchy they are 
but the very humble subjects of the king or emperor. 
  I,—Racr—NaTION—PEOPLE. 
A race is composed of the descendants of common ancestors, from whom they 
inherit certain moral, intellectual, and physical qualities. The Gallic race and 
the Germanic race, for instance, may be mentioned. 
A nation or a people is a body of inhabitants of the same country, speaking the 
same language, and having common interests and the same history. 
The words French nation, French people, mean all the inhabitants of France, 
without distinction of race.

IIl.—FRENCH CiTIZENSHIP. 
A French citizen is one who enjoys political rights in France. To enjoy these 
rights one must have attained to the age of 21 years, be French born, or have 
become naturalized. 
The following forfeit their political rights: 
(1) Those who have suffered penal retribution and ignominious punishment— 
or the latter only. 
(2) Those who have been deprived by law of their right to vote and election. 
Consult the table of those incapacitated to vote, published by the minister of the 
interior, July 12, 1874. Also, consult Municipal Life, by S. A. Nonus. 
_ Observation: Whoever does not love France, or commits wrong, should be struck 
off the list of French citizens. 
III.—How onE BECOMES AND CEASES TO BE A FRENCH CITIZEN, 
The following become French citizens: 
(1) The foreigner who marries a Frenchman. 
(2) Foreigners who have been naturalized. 
On request for naturalization, it is enacted by law, after proper inquiry. 
The following are no longer French citizens: 
(1) The Frenchman who becomes naturalized in a foreign country. 
(2) The Frenchman who, without authority from the Government, enters a 
foreign military service or accepts public office under a foreign government. 
Observation: Foreigners should not receive the title of French citizen unless 
they are truly deserving. 
IV.—RIGHTS GUARANTEED TO ALL CITIZENS. 
French citizens enjoy a certain number of rights, defined in the article on rights 
of man and of citizens. These rights may be divided into three categories: 
(1) Individual rights, guaranteed to all men, women, and children. 
(2) Civil rights, allowed to men and women of age. 
(8) Political rights, allowed only to men of age. 
Refer to the lesson on the Rights of Citizens. Notice that the rights to be 
discussed in the next lesson are the counterpart of the duties spoken of in the 
lessons on morals. 
Observation: Let us be proud of being French citizens and vigilantly guard our 
rights. 
First. The right of property: The right of property is the right to possess what 
one has acquired by work, inheritance, or donation. The owner may dispose of 
his effects as of his person. ‘‘ Property is an inviolable and sacred right, of which 
one can be deprived only when public necessity, legally defined, so requires, and 
then only under the condition of a just and previous indemnity.” This is called 
renunciation for the cause of public necessity. 
Reflection: Every citizen should respect the property of others. 
Second. The right of vote—Universal suffrage: Civic or political rights are the 
rights granted to citizens of age in their relations with the State; as, the right to 
serve as a witness; the right of oath; the right to vote. 
Universal suffrage is the right common to all French citizens to take part by 
vote in the election of those appointed to govern or represent the nation, depart- 
ment, arrondissement, or commune. To be able to vote, one must be 21 years 
of age and enjoy his civic rights. 
Refer to lesson 4. A tax must be voted by the representatives of the nation. 
A citizen need not pay even a centime unless the tax has been legally voted. 
Reflections: The right to yote imposes the duty of knowledge. Since all profit

by public expenditure, it is just that each should contribute to it according to his 
means. 
Third. National sovereignty: The principle of all sovereignty rests essentially in 
the nation. No individual nor body of men can exercise authority unless it has 
been so decreed. 
The French nation is free and is its own mistress. 
Sovereignty is exercised by the right of vote, that is to say, the right to nominate 
representatives or mandataries for the different elective officers, as deputies, sen- 
ators, and others. 
Reflection: All power is vested in the people; they alone are sovereigns,

Refer to the instruction on morals. Pupils should review this lesson.! 
II—THE OBLIGATION OF EDUCATION, 
Law of March 28, 1882. Primary instruction is compulsory for children of both 
sexes aged from 6 to13 years. Children should either attend primary or secondary 
educational institutions, public or private schools, or be taught at home, by the 
father of the family himself or some other competent person. In pursuance of the 
obligation, the law has established free primary schools. 
The father of the family is free to have his children instructed as he chooses, 
but the law will not permit them to grow up in ignorance. 
In each commune commissioners of education are appointed to superintend and 
encourage attendance at schools. Penalties are imposed upon negligent parents. 
Children instructed at home undergo an examination at the end and at the begin- 
ning of the scholastic year, 
Reflection: Parents have no more right to deprive their children of education 
than of bread. 
If].—ORGANIZATION OF PuBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
In France there are three degrees of public instruction. 
(1) Primary instruction: The classes of primary schools are infant schools for 
children 2 to 6 years of age, infant classes for children 4 to 7 years of age, ele- 
mentary primary schools, complementary classes, and superior primary or high 
schools. 
(2) Secondary instruction: The classes of secondary schools are lyceums and 
colleges, with secondary and secondary-modern courses. 
(8) Superior instruction: The classes of higher schools are the faculties of litera- 
ture, sciences, law, medicine, and pharmacy. They also comprise what are known 
as special schools, as the Military School of Saint-Cyr, the Polytechnic School, 
and the National University. 
Reflection: Owing to the beautiful institution of the scholarship funds, or 
bourses, a child of the poorest workman can, by intelligence and courage, pursue 
the highest courses of study. 
  IV.—FUNCTIONARIES OF PRIVATE INSTRUCTION. 
(a) Instruction: Infant schools are under directresses and assistant directresses; 
elementary primary schools, under instructors and instructresses, full titled, and 
those not yet graduated; high schools, under directors, professors, and assistants— 
male and female.

   (b) Superintendence and inspection: Superintendents of schools are as follows: 
Commissioners of cantons, commissioners of inspection, inspectresses of infant 
schools, primary inspectors, academy inspectors, the rector, inspectors-general, 
inspectresses-general for infant schools. 
The prefect, by advice of the academy inspector, appoints the full-titled teach- 
ers, male and female. He presides over the departmental counsel occupied with 
affairs relative to primary instruction in the departments. 
Reflection: The functionaries of primary instruction are well-instructed per- 
sons devoted to children, 
MILITARY SERVICE. 
I.—NECESSITY OF THIS SERVICE. 
   
    
          
           
    
         
    
    
   
    
     
    
    
         Though an evil, war is sometimes necessary. Should France be attacked, it 
must be defended; but we can not defend it efficaciously merely by taking a gun 
in hand and marching against the enemy. We must be prepared by military 
service. As military service has been constituted for the defense of our common 
mother, it is just that all Frenchmen should be obliged to serve. To serve one’s 
country is not only an obligation, but it is also an honor, and no individual pun- 
ished for any dishonorable act is allowed to serve in the French army. 
Reflections: For a successful defense of our country, we must be prepared by 
military service. A good pupil will certainly be a good citizen and a good soldier.     
II.—ENLISTMENT—BOARD OF INSPECTION, 
The following two principles govern the recruitment of the army: 
(1) The obligation of military service devolves upon all. 
(2) The full term is twenty-five years. 
At the beginning of every year the mayors of each commune take a census of 
the young men who completed the twentieth year of their age the year before. 
The enlistment takes place in the chief town of every canton at a public meeting 
presided over by the subprefect. 
The board of inspectors is presided over by the prefect or the secretary-general. 
It likewise meets in the chief town of the canton. 
Young men disqualified by any infirmity are exempted from military service. 
Dispensations are also granted to certain classes of conscripts, but only in time of 
peace. Those dispensed are obliged to pay a military tax. 
Reflection: It is an honor to serve our country. 
Iil.—Tue ActivE ArMY—RESERVES—THE TERRITORIAL ARMY—AUXILIARY 
AGENCIES—THE MARINE—MILITARY DECORATIONS. 
Every Frenchman enlisted serves successively in the active army for three years, 
the reserves of the active army for ten years, the territorial army for six years, 
and the reserves for the territorial army for six years. The term of service begins 
with the ist of November in the year of enlistment. 
The French army consists of (1) infantry, (2) cavalry, (3) artillery, (4) engineer 
corps; and the auxiliary service is attached to this main body, as (a) quartermas- 
ter’s department, (b) medical service and ambulances. 
The navy is recruited from the naval conscriptions, by volunteers, or from the 
first members of the contingent. 
The military decorations are (1) the military medal, (2) the Legion of Honor, 
(3) commemorative medals. 
Reflection: Formerly the nation had an army; now the whole nation is armed.

IV.—Miarary DiscipLInE—INFRACTORS. 
Discipline is immediate voluntary obedience to the orders of superiors, who 
command only what the laws and regulations prescribe, Discipline is one of the 
greatest forces of the army. 
Courts-martial are special tribunals held for the judgment of crimes and mis- 
demeanors committed by any member of the military organization. A court- 
martial consists of members of the army. It is composed of six officers and one 
subordinate officer. 
An infractor is one who evades the law of recruitment; a deserter is one who 
leaves his regiment without permission. Both are punished by law. 
Reflection: Military discipline is severe, but it is the duty of a soldier to submit 
to it for the love of his country. 
TAXES. 
I.—NEcEssITy oF TaxEs—DiIREcT AND INDIRECT TAXES. 
(Refer to the duties to our country, and the right to vote—taxes.) 
Taxes are the contributions of every citizen toward the expenses of State, 
department, or commune for public services. The army, the marine, public 
works, public institutions, and so on, are the public services for which the larger 
part of the taxes is spent. All these services are necessary, even indispensable, 
and they entail enormous expenditures; hence the necessity for taxes, 
There are two kinds of taxes, direct and indirect taxes. 
The taxes on land, personal property and chattels, the tax on doors and windows, 
the tax on patents, the military tax, the taxes on horses and carriages as articles 
of luxury, on wheels, billiards, etc., are direct taxes. 
The principal indirect taxes are those on drinks, sugar, coffee, etc. 
Monopoly is the right reserved by the State for manufacturing and selling cer- 
tain products, such as tobacco, timber, gunpowder, etc. 
There are also duties and city toll. 
Reflection: To support the public offices and defray the expenses of adminis- 
tration a common contribution is indispensable. (Consult On the Rightsof Man 
and Citizens. ) 
II.—Bupeets. 
The budget is a statement of the probable receipts. and expenses of a country, 
department, commune, or public administration. 
The budget of the State is examined and voted each year by the Chambers. The 
budget of receipts determines the different rates of taxes to beraised. The total 
direct taxes are divided among the departments and then among the communes. 
The budget of the departments is voted by the general council. The budget of 
communes is voted by the municipal council and approved by the prefect. 
Reflection: Colbert was the first to conceive the excellent idea of making out a 
budget, or yearly statement of receipts and expenses. - 
III.—FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION. 
A taxgatherer collects the direct taxes. 
In the chief town of every arrondissement a special collector takes charge of the 
amounts handed in by the taxgatherers. 
The special collectors pass their funds over to the general treasurer of the 
department. 
The financial board and the councils of prefecture verify the accounts of the 
administrations of State and commune. 
The minister of finances is at the head of the financial administration. 
Reflection: Order in finances is indispensable to the prosperity of a State.

ADMINISTRATION. 
I.—Commune—MonicieaL CounciL—BUDGET. 
A commune is the smallest political division of finance. Each commune is gov- 
erned by a mayor, aided by one or more assistants and a municipal council. 
Municipal councils, the number of which varies from 10 to 36 according to 
population, are elected by ballot for four years. They must be 25 years old. 
They meet in ordinary session four times a year; but extraordinary sessions may 
be convened. 
The municipal council nominates the mayor and assistants. It considers all 
affairs of interest to the commune and nominates one or more senators. It votes 
the budget of the commune. ‘The expenditures of the commune include prin- 
cipally the expenses of communal administration, the maintenance of roads, pub- 
lic buildings, and loans.” (Ch. Dupuy.) 
Reflection: The administration of the commune is not independent; itis under 
the authority of the prefects, agents of the central power. 
II.—Mayors aNnpD ASSISTANTS. 
The mayor is the first magistrate of the commune. In case of absence or hin- 
drance, his place is filled by the first assistant or any other. In large cities the 
mayor can delegate his authority to the assistants for the exercise of a number of 
municipal functions. 
The power of the mayor isextensive. Heisacivil officer and chief of the munici- 
pal police force. He is the agent of the executive power and executes the deci- 
sions of the municipal council. He proposes the budget and orders the expenses. 
He nominates acertain number of municipal officers, and represents the commune 
in its affairs of interest. He frames resolutions on subjects pertaining to his 
administration. 
Reflection: The mayor is at the same time an officer of the commune and a 
representative of the State. 
III. —ARRONDISSEMENT—DEPARTMENT—SUBPREFECT—PREFECT—COUNCIL OF 
PREFECTURE. 
An arrondissement is governed by a subprefect. 
The subprefect serves as intermediary between the prefect and mayors. He 
rules the administrative affairs of the arrondissement and presides at enlist- 
ments, etc. 
A department is governed by a prefect, who is at the same time the agent of the 
Government, the representative of the department, and the warden of the 
communes. 
As agent of the Government, he superintends the execution of the laws, nomi- 
nates certain officers, frames resolutions, etc. 
As administrator of the department, he executes the decisions of the general 
council, prepares the departmental budget, etc. 
As warden of the communes, he approves the budget, controls the expenses, 
examines contracts of purchases and sales, constructions, etc. 
The council of prefecture is an administrative tribunal. It examines the 
accounts of communes and charitable institutions, the income of which can not 
exceed 30,000 francs. It judges disagreements of communes, decides municipal 
elections, etc. 
Reflection: France has been divided into Geqack coca since 1790, The adminis- 
tration of departments is based on that of the State.

260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
IV.—Counci. oF THE ARRONDISSEMENT—GENERAL COUNCIL. 
The council of the arrondissement is composed of as many members as there are 
cantons in the arrondissement, though they must number atleast nine. It meets 
twice a year. It distributes among the communes the direct taxes imposed on the 
arrondissement by the general council, advises the creation of markets and market 
places, decides questions of local interest, etc. 
The general council is composed of as many members as there are cantons in 
the department. The councilors are elected for six years, though half are changed 
every three years. The general council considers all affairs concerning the depart- 
ment. It advises, by request, communal affairs and the councils of arrondisse- 
ment, and issues opinions on all questions of interest to the department. Members 
of the general council are senatorial electors. To represent it during sessions and 
to regulate current affairs, the general council elects from among its members a 
commission entitled ‘‘departmental commission,” which meets at least once a 
month. 
Reflection: The general council is, so to speak, the municipal council of the 
department. 
I.—THE CONSTITUTION—PUBLIC POWERS. 
The public powers are organized as follows: 
(1) The legislative power, vested in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. 
(2) The executive power, possessed by the President of the Republic and the 
ministers. 
(3) The judiciary power, whose sphere it is to punish violations of the laws and 
to decide controversies. This power is vested in the courts. 
These three great powers are distinct from one another and can not be in the 
hands of one person, This is what is known as the separation of the powers. 
Reflection: The separation of the powers is the guaranty of the liberty of 
citizens. 
Il.—LEGISLATIVE POWERS. 
  1. The Senate.—The Senate is composed of 800 members. No Frenchman can 
be a senator unless he is at least 40 years old and enjoys civil and political rights. 
Senators are elected by ballot and by universal or restricted suffrage. The 
senatorial electors are as follows: 
(1) The deputies of the departments. 
(2) Members of the general council and councils of arrondissements. 
(8) Delegates of municipal councils. 
The voting takes place in the chief town of the department under the president 
of the civil court as presiding officer. Senators are elected for nine years. One- 
third of this number is changed every three years. 
The Senate, together with the Chamber of Deputies, has the initiative of laws. 
Financial laws are always first proposed in the Chamber of Deputies. 
The Senate can constitute a supreme court to judge either the President or the 
ministers, or to condemn any attack against the security of the State. 
By advice of the Senate the President can adjourn the Chamber of Deputies. 
2. The Chamber of Deputies.—Deputies are elected by universal suffrage and 
individual ballot. 
To be a deputy one must be a French citizen, 25 years of age and enjoying civil 
and political rights. Deputies are elected for four years. Each arrondissement 
elects at least one deputy. The actual number is 580. 
From a legislative point of view, the Chamber of Deputies has the same rights 
as the Senate. It has even a priority with financial iaws.
-P-A-G-E-341
  THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 261 
The Chambers meet every year on the second Tuesday in January. They must 
be in session at least five months every year. 
Reflection: Deputies and senators are officers of the citizens. It is their duty 
to work in unison for the nation’s prosperity. 
IIl.—Tur Executive Power. 
The executive power is vested in the President and in the ministers. 
The President of the Republic is the head of the executive power—the first 
magistrate of France. 
The President is elected by the absolute majority of votes by the Senate and 
Chamber of Deputies united, at Versailles, in national assembly. He is nomi- 
nated for seven years, and can be reelected. 
The President can be impeached for high treason only. The Chamber of Depu- 
ties alone has the right to accuse, and the Senate the right to judge him. 
Reflection: M. Felix Faure has been President since January 17, 1895. 
IV.—DvTIES OF THE PRESIDENT. 
The President convenes the Chambers and closes their sessions. He communi- 
cates with them by message. 
The President promulgates the laws voted by the Chambers, and assures their 
execution. He has the right to make peace. Amnesties can not be granted but 
by alaw. He controls the armed force, but can not declare war without the pre- 
vious consent of both Chambers. He appoints all civil and military officers, and 
presides at all national solemnities. He represents France, and negotiates treaties 
with foreign powers, but under condition of submitting them to the considera- 
tion of the Chambers. Finally, he receives ambassadors. 
Reflections: The President personifies France; to be wanting in respect to him 
would be an insult to France itself. 
I.—THE EXECUTIVE POWER (CONTINUATION)—MINISTERS. 
The ministers are the heads of the great public departments of administration. 
They are chosen by the Presidents, ordinarily from among the members of both 
Chambers. They have aright to the floor of the Chambers, and should receive 
attention when they request a hearing. They are jointly and severally responsi- 
ble to the Chambers for the general policy of the Government, and individually 
for their personal acts. 
There are eleven ministers. 
MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR, 
The special duties of the minister of the interior are to superintend the interior 
administration of France, the police, elections, public assistance, communal 
administration, etc. Under him are the prefects, subprefects, mayors, etc. 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
The minister of foreign affairs has charge of the political and commercial rela- 
tions of France with foreign nations. Under him are ambassadors, ministers 
plenipotentiary, chargé d'affaires, consuls, etc. 
MINISTER OF FINANCE, 
The minister of finance superintends the collection of taxes, the total amount 
of which constitutes what is called the treasury, and regularly pays the expenses 
voted by the Chambers. He prepares and presents the state budget. (Refer to 
the lesson on financial administration.)  
-P-A-G-E-342
    262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
MINISTER OF WAR. 
The minister of war is the commander-in-chief of the army. Recruitment and 
military instruction of the different soldiers are committed to him. He directs all 
that relates to the defense of ourcountry, fortifications, distribution of troops, etc. 
MINISTER OF THE MARINE, 
The minister of the marine is at the head of the navy. He superintends the 
recruitment of the marine, the maintenance of arsenals, the construction of war 
vessels, the defense of coasts, ports, harbors, etc. 
MINISTER OF JUSTICE. 
The minister of justice, also called ‘‘ keeper of the seals,” is the head of judiciary 
power. All judicial officers are under his authority. 
MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND OF THE FINE ARTs. 
The minister of public instruction is at the head of all State educational insti- 
tutions. All the institutions and functionaries of this minister are comprehended 
in the term “university,” and he is also called “head master of the university.” 
The duties of the minister of public instruction pertain to what relates to the 
fine arts, museums, theaters, historic monuments, etc. 
MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS. 
The minister of public works superintends the building and maintenance of 
works of public interest, such as roads, canals, dikes, etc. Under him are 
engineers, keepers of bridges and causeways, overseers of roads, etc. 
MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. 
It is the duty of this minister to encourage and favor commerce and industry. 
He negotiates commercial treaties with other nations and superintends manufac- 
tures. The central school, the conservatory of arts and trades, art and trade 
schools, and commercial high schools are under his direction. 
The mail and telegraph services are attached to the province of this minister. 
MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. 
It is the duty of this minister to encourage and protect the interests of agricul- 
ture, one of the principal sources of a country’s wealth. The minister of agri- 
culture superintends the school of agriculture in Paris, national agricultural 
schools, farm schools, veterinary schools, forest culture. 
MINISTER OF COLONIES, 
This minister directs all colonial affairs—administration, production, ete. 
WORSHIP. 
The minister of worship is sometimes attached to the province of the minister 
of public instruction and sometimes to that of the minister of justice or of the 
interior. 
II.—JuDICIARY POWER. 
Judiciary power is vested in the courts. There are two principal kinds of 
courts—those administering civil justice and those administering penal or crimi- 
nal justice. 
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE. 
The justice of the peace is the first degree of judiciary power. There is a jus- 
_tice of the peace in the chief town of every canton. 
\ The justice of the peace conciliates. In civil matters he judges without appeal
-P-A-G-E-343
  
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 263 
in cases where the value does not exceed 100 francs. He alone, in penal matters, 
forms a simple police court; he can impose a fine of from 1 to 15 francs and 
imprisonment for two to five days. The justice of the peace is a movable office, 
TRIBUNAL OF THE FIRST INSTANCE. 
There is a court of the first instance in the chief town of every arrondissement. 
In civil matters it judges, by appeal, affairs judged by justices of the peace, and 
also those which are too important to be judged by that magistrate. 
As a court of correction, it judges misdemeanors punishable by more than a fine 
of 15 francs or five days’ imprisonment. 
COURT OF APPEALS. 
There are twenty-five courts of appeals. They judge civil and criminal cases 
already judged by courts of the first instance. 
COURT OF ASSIZES. 
There is one court of assizes in every department. They hold general sessions. 
In the court of assizes the judges do not decide whether the accused be guilty or 
not; this duty belongs to the jury composed of twelve citizens, called jurymen. 
The magistrates who, together with the jury, form the court of assizes pro- 
nounce acquittal or sentence after the verdict of the jury. Decisions of the court 
of assizes can be appealed only to the court of cassation, and only for an error of 
form. i 
COURT OF CASSATION. 
The court of cassation is the sapreme court to which decisions of the courts of 
appeals and the courts of assizes may be appealed. It meets in Paris. 
The court of cassation does not judge; it confirms or breaks decisions; that is 
to say, annuls those that have been rendered contrary to law or prescribed form. 
If a judgment is broken, the case is referred to another court of appeals, or 
another court of assizes, to be reinvestigated and judged anew. 
Ill.—Pusiic Mryistry. 
Attached to every court of the first instance is a procurator, with one or more 
substitutes. 
A procurator-general, attorneys-general, and substitutes of the procurator- 
general are connected with every court of appeals and the court of cassation. 
The procurators and their substitutes form what is called the parquet of a court 
of justice. 
The office filled by these magistrates is called public ministry. In the name of 
seciety the procurator traces the criminal, brings him before the court, and out 
of public interests demands his punishment. 
The members of the parquet change places, and are called the standing magis- 
tracy. The judges do notchange places, and constitute the sealed magistracy. 
Besides the courts mentioned, there are special tribunals, as commercial tribu- 
nals, seaport councils, councils of war, councils of prefecture, and State councils. 
Reflection: Judges have a delicate mission to fulfill. They should be inde- 
pendent and impartial. 
THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN ENGLAND. 
In the recent development of evening schools in England special 
stress has been laid upon instruction in citizenship. An elaborate 
course! upon the life and duties of the citizen has been included in 
  
1 The course will be found in full in the Commissioner’s Report for 1893-94, Vol. 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  the regulations for evening schools. Text-books on the subject have 
multiplied under the impetus thus given, and it has become a promi- 
nent theme of public discussion. One of the most valuable contri- 
butions to the literature of the subject is a pamphlet from the pen 
of Prof. Patrick Geddes, of Edinburgh, who not only attempts to 
awaken the civic sense in his countrymen, but sets them the example 
of earnest practical efforts for the development of municipal life. In 
a paper presented recently before the ‘‘ Cooperative Wholesale Socie- 
ties,” 1 Professor Geddes discusses the place of history and geography 
in education for economics and citizenship. The paper is extremely 
interesting and suggestive. The following extracts are pertinent to 
the subject. 
He first discusses the relations of geography and history to education 
for economics and citizenship, saying: 
To too many people, I fear, to speak of the study of geography is to recall those 
weary lists of towns and counties, those wretched enumerations of rivers and 
mountains, straits and gulfs, which they learned, or failed to learn, by rote at 
school, while similarly history may but stand for an even more dreary catalogue 
of names and dates. Even if we were somewhat better taught, we have done with 
school subjects and have no time to pore over those huge atlases of geography or 
read those innumerable volumes of history in our reference library. Economics 
is what now interests us; that deals with actual problems of capital and labor, of 
cooperation or socialism. Wecan not any longer, with the classical economists, 
shut off moral considerations as irrelevant, since it has now become more or less 
evident that the continued progress, perhaps even the continued existence, of our 
great modern industrial communities requires also some education in citizenship. 
But this education, when it gefs beyond mere vague aspiration and exhortation, 
seems restricted to the generalities of conduct common to all civilized communities. 
It is not yet related to economics as a science; for what after all can it really tell or 
advise to laborers and capitalists? Still less has it any definite relation to history 
and geography. Hence, while there is no doubt that an increasing proportion of 
minds desire and even profit by the often excellent lay preaching of the civic mor- 
alist, there is no small danger of his failing in direct result, much as ordinary 
preaching tends to do, and for the same reason—the insufficiently clear relation of 
its general ideals to the particular details of daily life and duty; and hence, excel- 
lent as may be Mr. Acland’s addition of a course upon the ‘‘ Life and duties of the 
citizen” to the new educational code for evening schools, it is still seriously to be 
doubted whether the extra schoolbook which he is thus adding to the multifarious 
confusion of that traveling library which our children take daily upon their 
shoulders is as yet adapted to mean much more to them than did the edifying 
compilation of older mold to which ioo many of us still look back as of such 
memorable wearisomeness. * * * 
Though thus so far from sharing the current optimism as to the new movement 
of civic education, I am not proposing to go back to the old state of things, but to 
go forward toward a better one. I do not propose to have any finished solution 
to the educational difficulty, even if there were ever very much demand for reme- 
dies to the body politic before it feels the disease, much less when it has not even 
recognized the possibility of one. * * * Evenif we can not reform the world 
from our existing school machinery, nor even reform the school from our ideals 
of a better world, we may help each forward a step here and a step there.

THE TEACHING OF CIVICS IN EUROPE. 265 
In another chapter of the pamphlet Professor Geddes discusses the 
question, What may be done by individuals in home life and how 
may they come in touch with the world of higher education. He says: 
The children are coming home from school to prepare their lessons—so much 
history, so much geography, and now also so much ‘‘citizenship.” We men have 
our newspapers, our cooperative annual, and what not, our economic and political 
interests generally. Our wives and sisters have their domestic cares, their keen 
personal interests, their wide and warm, if vague, sympathies. Can we not in 
some way bring all these divergent interests together? Each at present, must it 
not be frankly admitted, rather bores the other, however strong be the bond of 
natural affection. 
The men can not but weary of the women’s talk and the women of the men’s 
reading, while the children understand neither; and if either help the children 
with their lessons it is surely moreas a duty than a pleasure and with a keen sense 
of thankfulness that one has not one’s self to practice this rule or pass that examina- 
tion. Norealconnection of these different mental interests ever occurs to most peo- 
ple as possible, and so each of us goes on in his old way and returns to his own world 
of ideas and culture—for the child, the school; for the woman, perhaps the church; 
for the man, his club, committee, or reading room; and the home thus gradually 
dissolves until too often we reach the all but complete disintegration too common 
in the Parisian household. Here, however, at length comes in the essential point 
and thesis of the present paper—that all these apparently distinct studies and 
interests are but the scattered elements of what should bea well-knit unity, toward 
weaving which we may find at once a useful start and stimulus in this new course 
of education in citizenship. * * * 
No intelligent man but may at any rate now and then help his son over his 
difficulties with the text-book of citizenship and put more meaning into those 
general accounts of Parliament and ministry, of municipal cooperation or poor 
rate, of army or civil service, which the new subject requires, from his own expe- 
rience or reading. And having thus made a beginning as a teacher, he will soon 
begin to reap the reward of every true one—that of constantly finding out where 
his own knowledge is deficient and of every now and then awakening to see even 
the most familiar fact from some fresh point of view. 
The author then advises the use of appropriate storybooks, saying: 
I think it by no means irrelevant to this discussion of geography and history for 
economics and citizenship, but possibly reassuring to some parent, suggestive to 
some teacher, at any rate encouraging to some schoolboy here and there, to testify 
(as I dare say many others might also do), first, that I now see I got no such real 
glimpse either to the concrete realities of geography or of the elementary reali- 
ties of economics at school, nor even until I had wandered through a dozen uni- 
versities, as I got from these simple coral island and fur-trading stories of Ballan- 
tyne’s; secondly, that such public and civic feelings as I may now have to go upon 
were first awakened into life and action not by the abstract moralities nor the 
historical and statistical facts, of which I got my full share, but by Ballantyne’s 
Lifeboat and a boyish attempt to help the ‘‘National Lifeboat Association,” 
for which that book so strongly pleads; thirdly, after seven or eight years’ 
responsibilities in the organization of historical studies and a good deal of per- 
sonal work, particularly at the dry and unimaginative task of compiling all known 
dates, reigns, battles, and all the rest of it into an historical atlas, or rather chart, 
Ihave heard of no other introductory guide to history who can replace Sir Walter. 
Since public libraries were opened we have constantly had lamentations over 
the decline of serious reading, evidenced by the high proportion of “ fiction” to 
“substantial works,” of mere ‘‘novel reading” to ‘‘solid reading.” The obvious

  elements of truth in this criticism I need not insult anyone by pointing out, but 
there is more need to suggest that he may as profitably think out the fully as large 
element of error in it, the still larger elements of error in the remedies commonly 
proposed. Though personally areader of books whose solidity reaches what most 
of even these most serious people consider the most utter and intolerable dryness 
and a writer whose most imaginative flights have been confined within the limits 
of the Encyclopedia Britannica and its congeners, lam more and more convinced 
that we serious people have been wrong and that the growing predominance of 
the literature of imagination and feeling over the literature of pure intellect is 
perhaps the most hopeful sign of the times. But most of this fiction is rubbish, 
say you? No, not most of what people read most as distinguished from what 
they only look at, sample, dip into, and skim. The reviewer helps the educated 
classes, and, like the tea taster, does the sampling for us; but the general reader 
is only learning to use the often excellent reviewing of the leading newspapers, 
and it will not be until the halfpenny evening newspapers take up the same work 
and do it as regularly and as well, and until some other of the bits of social organ- 
ization half suggested above have come into full activity, that we can reasonably 
expect much improvement from the great body of younger and simpler readers. 
Weed out, then, by all means, the inferior literature of imagination and feeling, 
but there will still remain much of what the Puritan within us most dislikes—that 
literature of inferior or debased imagination and inferior or debased feeling which 
yet fascinates the reader by its literary power. Here, of course, a finer criticism 
may come in, but still hardly a reader will be gained for the ‘‘solid” books. 
What, then, is the remedy? It is to make these solid, dry bones live; and whoever 
has the open secret of doing this will not always lack readers. The natural 
sciences are one to the learner. The astronomers and geologists have largely 
succeeded—witness Proctor, Lockyer, or Ball, Hugh Miller, Lyell, or the brothers 
Geikie; and at times, too, the naturalists, from Buffon and Huxley, or more lately 
Arthur Thomson and Professor Drummond. In this way, for instance, the very 
word ‘‘ evolution ” is coming to have, with its vastly deepening intellectual mean- 
ing, a corresponding infinitude of imagining possibilities, and with these of moods 
of feeling, from blackest pessimism to inextinguishable hope and brightening joy, 
for though still a few years ago a byword to many and at best a zoological and 
botanical theory to the few, it is now seen and felt to be the name of the great 
“Drama of the Universe.” 
Of this drama we see each man is, as in a dream, both actor and spectator. He 
is gradually awakening to the spectacle of the natural world around him, and 
speaks of his scanty but increasing store of ideas as the ‘‘ Progress of natural sci- 
ence.” He utilizes and modifies the world to his changing needs or impulses, and 
calls the result ‘‘ Progress of industry.” But it is his fellows that most interest 
him, and nature seems but the background—the scenery and stage—for the great 
spectacle of the human world. To-day, to-morrow, yesterday, these are what 
primarily interest us, and hence we rightly buy our daily newspapers as the bill 
and abstract of the play, or rather the day’s act. But to understand the present 
day we need to survey and condense the records of many past ones; that is ‘‘ His- 
tory.” Again, we can understand neither past nor present acts without knowing 
something of the scenes which condition them, and this is ‘‘Geography.” But we 
would not choose to listen to loose, haphazard fragments of the play, and these 
without seeing or at any rate thinking of the scenes where they were laid. Still 
less would we try to learn by rote a mere catalogue of pieces of scene without 
caring or even knowing what part of the play they belong to. Yet this has been 
for long enough the “history” and the ‘‘ geography” of the schools, and, though 
both are improving and better teachers are scattered everywhere, it is not too 
much to say that their needed reorganization and reunion is scarcely more than 
begun.

CHAPTER VIII. 
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 
By Dan 
  “EL QUINN, Ph. D. 
INTRODUCTION. 
I first became interested in the Greeks of to-day because I regarded them as 
descended from those old Hellenes whose culture and civilization, as classic and as 
Christian, are the foundation that lies beneath all modern progress. 
‘ But without losing my intense love for classic Hellenism, I soon began to admire 
the modern Greeks not so much on account of their historic ancestors as on account 
of their own sterling virtues and high natural intelligence. 
I feel that I now admire the ancient Greeks even more than I did in the enthusi- 
astic days of my youth; but I admire them as well for having produced the modern 
Greek, with his noble and determined aspirations, as for having civilized all the rest 
of Europe. 
Of all the phases of contemporary Greek life, their system of education is in some 
respects least attractive to us, because it is the most modified by foreign influence. 
Indeed, even a close observer might think that the system is entirely a foreign one. 
But it is wrong to judge entirely by the appearance of the body what the soul is. 
The outward form of modern Greek education is German and French in character, 
but the soul is Hellenic. In the following pages, unfortunately, I portray the out- 
ward form rather than the soul; and I give not so much a full picture as the merest 
sketch—a sketch in some parts clearly delineated, in other parts most imperfectly, 
but a sketch which I hope to finish year by year into a more presentable picture.

VaRIoUS AND GRADUAL MODIFICATIONS THAT GREEK EDUCATION AND CULTURE 
UNDERWENT FROM THE FirrH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST DOWN TO THE CHRIS- 
TIANIZATION OF THE GREEKS. 
When we think of Greece, we usually picture the Greece of classic days—Greece that 
we became acquainted with when we were boys at school; Greece which in the age 
of Perikles created itself into a state of society which ever since has been regarded 
as a model for imitation and for study. 
Greece of to-day is far different from the ideal land of our schoolboy dreams, and 
yet Greece of to-day is so essentially one with Greece of the past that it is impos- 
sible to understand modern Greece without knowing classic Greece and the unbroken 
history of the Greek people from those classic times down to the present century. 
Here, however, is not the proper place to treat in general of the history of Greece. 
Imerely say that in writing about the condition of education among the modern 
Greeks it must be taken for granted that the history of the people is quite well

  known. I wish also to note tho fact that not a few historians of repute recog- 
nize the uninterrupted continuity of Greek history through a period of almost 
thirty centuries, and give an unbroken account of the origin and growth, glories 
and disgraces, triumphs and falls, of this nation from its first obscure days down to 
our own age—such historians as Paparrhigopoulos (K. Tazappyyorob2ov ‘Iotopla rod 
‘EAAgvixod "Edvove axd rév dpyatotdtor ypdver péypt TOV KaB’ jude. év ’AOhvatc, 1886-87, 5

Oavog bird Ervpidwvog I. Adurpov, év ’ADFvacc, 1886-1892; completed down to the reign 
of the Empress Eirene), ‘l'imayenis (History of Greece from the Earliest Times down 
to the Present, by T. T. Timayenis, 1883), Wlad. de Brunet de Presle et Alex. Blanchet 
(La Grece depuis la conquéte romaine jusqu’A nos jours, Paris, 1860), and George 
Finlay (A History of Greece from its Conquest by the Romans to the Present Time— 
B.C. 146 to H. D. 1864, Oxford, 1877). 
Just as the thorough historian must trace the entire Hellenic stream in order to 
understand that portion of it which he sees to-day flowing by, so is it also necessary 
in writing of education in Greece of to-day to look back over the Greek education 
of the past. However, despite the importance of the history of education in ancient 
Greece, I shall treat it very briefly. Itis already wellknown. The nearer I approach 
to our own times the more diffuse do I intend to become. But before beginning it will 
be well to give a brief survey of the history of the Greeks. 
The history of ancient Greece is the history of a number of independent States. 
In classic times, and even later, Greece could no more be regarded as a unit well com- 
pacted than can Europe of to-day be regarded as such. Sparta, for instance, and 
Athens, were just as independent of each other, and just as jealous, as are France 
and Germany. And just as France and Germany could unite only against some com- 
mon enemy that threatened to destroy both, so could such ancient States as Athens, 
Sparta, Argos, Thebes, unite only when all were equally threatened with destruc- 
tion by some external foe, like the Persians. But just as Europe and America of 
to-day may be regarded as a unit distinct and different in civilization from the civili- 
zation of Asia or the barbarous or semibarbarous civilizations of other countries, so 
could Greece in those classic days be regarded as a unit against the rest of the world. 
As long as Greece remained independent, she thus continued to be a number of small 
States, bound together, not as parts of an organized whole, but by the brotherhood 
of common origin and, occasionally, of common interests. 
After Greece lost her independence this lack of unity is not so apparent. This is 
because Greece as a nation was no longer a factor in the political world, at least 
until she reappeared in Byzantine form. During her long subjection to foreign 
power her influence came from her citizens as individuals. As a nation she was 
powerless. It is only in our present century that Greece, after a resolute and suc- 
cessful struggle for freedom, finally manifested her unity in an outward and enduring 
manner. For since the London conference of 1830 the Greeks of the mainland and 
of a number of the islands constitute an independent and solid kingdom. 
Since education affects the entire course and all the actions of the individual’s 
life, both as private man and as citizen, and since, again, all the other great institu- 
tions of a nation affect the conditions and quality of the education of the individual, 
it would be necessary, in order to thoroughly comprehend a system of education in 
yoguo among a people to know scientifically and in detail the entire contemporary 
life and doings of that people. But the history of the Greeks from their submission 
to the Romans in 146 B.C. down to the establishment of the Eastern or Byzantine 
Empire, with its center at Constantinopol, in 323, and thence through the middle 
ages down to the fall of that city in 1453, is not yet more than crudely known to us. 
Accordingly we can but imperfectly understand its systems of education. 
For the sake of orientation, I here recall certain epoch-making events in the long 
life of the Greeks. 
Greece may be said to have been in her highest prosperity and civilization at about 
the time of the breaking out of the Peloponnesian war in 431 B.C. The disastrous 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 269 
effects of this war, which lasted almost thirty years, started Athens, then the great 
center of art and literature and all phases of Greek civilization, on her downward 
course. 
In 338 B. C. Greece lost her independence on the battlefield of Chaeroneia and 
became a portion of the Kingdom of Makedonia. The Makedonians claimed to be 
Greeks. If they really were not Greeks, they at least became such in culture and 
civilization soon after their closer contact with the conquered. 
In 323 B. C. Alexander, King of Makedonia and son of the conqueror Philip, died 
in Babylon, after having brought under his control all of the world that lies between 
the Euphrates and the Adriatic, the Danube and the deserts of Arabia and Africa. 
He subjected these various peoples to Greek civilization and Makedonian rule. 
After his death his vast empire was divided among his generals. Thus a number of 
smaller kingdoms arose, such as that of the Ptolemies in Egypt, or the Seleykids in 
Syria, or the Attalids in Pergamon. Each one of these smaller kingdoms became an 
independent center of Greek life. 
Gradually, however, all of these Greek kingdoms fell under the great new power of 
the West, Rome. But Rome, like Makedonia, on acquiring dominion over the coun- 
tries of the Greeks, herself became Greck in culture. (Cf. De LiterarumArtiumque 
Liberalium sive Ingenuarum apud Romanos Conditione, by Dr. F. Krause. Hohen- 
stein, 1849.) In 146 B.C. the Romans, after destroying Korinth, reduced all of 
Greece proper to the condition of a Roman province, as part of Makedonia. And 
from that time on Rome rapidly spread her rule over all Greek lands. 
When, in 323 after Christ, Constantine, feeling that the capital of the great Roman 
Empire should be situated farther east, selected Byzantion, he and his followers suc- 
ceeded in keeping this new eastern empire for a time Roman rather than Greek in 
official language, in court practices, and other externals. Finally, however, the 
soul prevailed over the body, and Byzantion and its provinces came out in their true 
nature, an independent kingdom, with Greek language and Greek traditions. The 
court alone and what directly depended on it remained tinged with a certain Roman 
coloring. However, the people accepted and willingly kept the name of Romans.” 
While Greece as a nation was buried in the Roman Empire Christianity came into 
existence in Judea, a small nation also subject at that time to Greek culture and to 
Roman arms. After this new religion had taken first roots in its native country 
Greeks and Greek-spirited Jews undertook the spreading of it throughout the vast 
Roman Empire. On this account Christianity, though first taught among a Semitic 
people, yet is bound up with Hellenism. The new religion accepted the wisdom of 
the Greeks. The new doctrines were explained in the well-prepared language of 
Piaton and Aristotel. The Christian teachings spread with wonderful rapidity. 
Its teachers were Hellenists, and the vehicle through which it was presented as a 
systematic body of doctrine was the Greek language and Greek metaphysics. The 
great teachers and formulators of the dogmas of Christianity were mostly Greeks. 
The new empire of the east, Roman in its name, Greek in its feelings, was Chris- 
tian in its religion. From the prominent part performed by Greeks in the spread- 
ing of religion, the Eastern Empire came in a certain way to regard itself as 
the great protector and director of Christianity. Thus the earlier councils of the 
Church were held in that Empire; and thus all the disputes relating to what the 
true Christian doctrine was in detail arose there. Most of the great heretics as well 
as incst of the great orthodox teachers were of the Eastern Church. 
Being a Christian Kingdom, many of the practices that bound the people to their 
pagan past died out. The gods were forgotten, or rather replaced by saints. The 
great feasts of pagan worship gave way to the grand pomps of the Christian ritual. 
In 393 the Olympian games were celebrated for the last time. In 529 the schools at 
Athens were closed by Justinian. Athens had long since ceased to be the great cen- 
ter of Hellenism. Constantinopol was now the center. The emperors ruled there 
in a magnificence beyond our knowledge. The gorgeousness of the church almost 
rivaled that of the state. The patriarch was in one sense as mighty as the Emperor. 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
  270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
But the great Empire had many enemies. Not only were there continually inter- 
nal dissensions arising from differences in religious beliefs, rivalries of princes and 
generals, of priests and monks, of various classes of the people at large, but it had 
many enemies from without. Many a horde of sturdy barbarians looked with hungry 
eye toward Constantinopol, for Constantinopol was the greatest center of wealth 
and luxury in the world. 
Various tribes of northern wanderers began to come down into the fair provinces 
of Greece. In the year 262 after Christ the Goths came, burning and plundering as 
far as to the gates of Athens. These are the Goths that had already defeated the 
Roman legions, and who later destroyed the Western Empire. But they were 
repulsed by the Athenians and forced to retreat. 
In 395 the Goths stormed down into Greece again. This time their leader was Ala- 
rich. They destroyed Elevsis and Athens and other places in north Greece, and, 
entering the Peloponnesos, they left it a burning waste. In 470 the Vandals were 
ravaging Greece. In 540 the Slavs came down into the provinces of Greece, and in 
588 they came again with the Avars. In 1019 the Bulgarians were defeated at Ther- 
mopyle and at Athens by the Emperor Basileios I. At about this same time the 
Albanians make their appearance in Greece, In 1040 the Warangs, a Norwegian 
tribe, under Harald Haardraade, plundered Athens. In 1084 the Normans came down 
as far as Larissa. 
What the ethnological effect of these various invasions was we have not now time 
to consider in a thorough manner. An opinion set afloat by Fallmerayer in his 
history of the Peloponnesos (Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea, Stuttgart und Tiibin- 
gen, 1830-1836) asserted that these various invaders, after entering Greece, ceased to 
be wanderers and roamers, and settled down in the villages whose Greek inhabitants 
they had killed, and that therefore the modern inhabitants of Greece are a much 
mixed race, having almost all kinds of bleod in their veins except Hellenic. This 
novel and fantastic opinion was immediately attacked by Hellenes and Philhellenes 
on patriotic as well as historic grounds. No one now defends it. These hordes of 
plupderers found nothing in Greece to entice them to remain there. However, 
various tribes of Slavs and Albanians did make small settlements here and there in 
Greece in those days. 
Another element that came into Greece was the Wallachian. The Wallachs came 
peaceably as shepherds and settled in the mountains. In the fifteenth century 
bands of Wallachians were to be found as far south as the Taygetos Mountains. 
(See Chalkokondyles, ed. Migne, p. 44.) But the Wallachs are not and never have 
been numerous in Greece. Of all the foreigners that settled in Greece during the 
middle ages the Albanians were the most numerous and have left the greatest num- 
ber of descendants. And yet in all Greece to-day these Albanians do not number 
more than 100,000. (See La Gréce au point de vue naturel, ethnologique, anthro- 
pologique, démographique et médical, par le Dr. Clon Stephanos, Paris, 1884, p. 430.) 
These invasions were indeed calamitous to Greece and the Eastern Empire. But 
a greater misfortune than all of these invasions were the armies of the west, which, 
starting out as crusaders or under the pretext of being such, often found the rich 
cities of the Eastern Empire temptations toward plunder too strong to be resisted. 
The fourth crusade was nothing other than a plundering expedition of brigands, who 
deliberately went to divide up the Byzantine Empire according to a prearranged 
plan. In 1204 they got into Constantinopol by treacherous promises and took pos- 
session of the city. They held it for fifty-seven years, establishing a Latin kingdom 
there. They took many of the provinces also, making them princedoms for western 
knights. 
At this time all of Greece proper fell into the hands of the Frankish princes. 
Greece remained under western control, chiefly French, Genoese, and Venetian, from 
that time until the Turks gradually got possession of the country after the fall of 
Constantinopol. 
At the end of the fifteenth century nearly all of Greece proper, except certain

monntain holds whose inhabitants were never really subdued, and nearly all of the 
islands except Krete and Tenos and a few others, were subject to the Turks. So 
the country remained until 1821, when the revolution broke out, which gloriously 
ended in bringing back their old independence to a portion of the Greeks. And 
this portion constitutes the present Kingdom of Hellas.

THE PRESENT KINGDOM OF GREECE. 
Greece of to-day is a small Kingdom, with its seat of government at Athens, the 
center of old classic Hellenism. The Kingdom includes all of the peninsula as far 
north as the Ambracian Gulf and nearly to the Melouna Pass, near Olympos. 
In 1830 the London conference recognized the existence of Greece as a free nation. 
In 1864 England ceded the Ionian Islands, which lie along the west shore of the 
Peleponnesos and Akarnania to the Kingdom of Greece. In 1880, at the behest of 
Europe, in the treaty of Berlin, Turkey ceded Thessaly and a small portion of 
southern Epeiros. The area of the Kingdom is about 24,800 square miles. The 
present population, according to the census of 1897, is about 2,433,806. 
But the yet unredeemed Greeks living outside of this territory regard it as merely 
a piece of ill fate that they also are not a part of the Kingdom. They look to 
Athens for light and guidance. In education, as in other respects, they follow the 
lead of Athens. Accordingly it will be necessary farther on to refer to the condi- 
tion of education among them. 
THE BEGINNINGS OF EDUCATION IN GREECE, 
No date marks the first discovery of the need of education. No page of history 
can precisely indicate to us the time at which the inhabitants of Greece began to be 
dissatisfied with simply letting their offspring grow up with only such care and 
crude training as savages give to their children. 
That the inhabitants of Greece were a civilized people long before they knew how 
to read and write seems proven by archeological research. (See the Mycenzan 
Age, by Dr. Chrestos Tsountas and J. Irving Manatt., Boston, 1897.) The Greeks of 
the Mykenzan period trained their children, but not in letters. Young boys 
learned how to do the work that awaited them as men. Every boy learned how to 
fight and to hunt, to rule or to obey. Many learned some one or more of the differ- 
ent arts, such as architecture, pottery, decorative art, and the making of various 
instruments and arms, especially from bronze. 
But ages before the coming of such education as is inseparably connected with 
the learning and employing of letters this old civilization had passed away. 
Indeed, we can not expect to find written thoughts, and therefore literary education, 
earlier than the beginning of the seventh century B.C. The origin and gradual 
adoption of the habit of writing in Greece is now quite familiar to us, thanks to the 
studies of Kirchhoff (Studien zur Geschichte des griechischen Alphabets, vierte 
Auflage, 1887), Larfeld (Griechische Epigraphik), and others. In the sixth century 
B. C. the Phenician alphabet was already common property throughout all Greek 
lands. True it is that the only documents that have come down to us in writing 
from that time are inscriptions on stone and bronze, and even they are rare. But the 
existence of these inscriptions proves that then it was not rare to know how to read 
and to write. 
Since ability to read and write presupposes a certain amount of education, it fol- 
lows that we can assert the existence of education throughout all Greek countries 
in the sixth century. But education was developed differently by the different 
tribes. Education in letters found favor especially with the Ionians. The Ionian
-P-A-G-E-352

type of education prevailed at Athens. And since it is Athenian education that 
most of all influenced later Greek education, just as Athenian literature became the 
model of later Greek literature, we in this chapter on ancient Greek education 
shall confine ourselves almost exclusively to education at Athens. And since Athenian 
education was at its height in the fifth century before Christ, most of our descrip- 
tions in detail will refer to Athenian education as it was in this fifth century. 
  EDUCATION IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B. C., ESPECIALLY AT ATHENS.! 
The most interesting period in the history of Greek education is probably that at 
which the literature and arts and political institutions of Athens were at their 
highest. This period may be conventionally regarded as beginning about 480 B. C. 
and closing about 325 B,C. Itis during this period that “higher education” was 
developed into a system by the philosophers and sophists; but since the work and 
influence of these men are well known we shall say very little about them, confining 
ourselves chiefly to observations on such education as boys received before entering 
on their eighteenth year, when they were enrolled as ‘‘ephebi.” 
Boys began to learn to read when 6 or 7 years old (Platon, Laws, vu, 794¢). Aris- 
totel, in his Politika, says that up to the seventh year the boy should be under the 
care of his nurse. The Athenians were very careful to provide proper persons to 
take care of children. Quintilian tells us (1, 1,4) that the celebrated stoic philoso- 
pher wrote a treatise on this subject, explaining why persons to whose charge chil- 
dren were intrusted should be cultured and educated and in the habit of speaking 
the Attic dialect correctly and without foreign pronunciation or foreign idioms, so 
that from the very beginning the child might learn such language as he later would 
use and hear in the the ekklesia and the agora. 
From Philostratos we learn that these nurses used to delight in teaching little 
children by telling them fables from Asopos about the mouse and the weasel, and 
the fox and the wolf, etc.; also that they used to tell them of the triumphs of their 
father or their older brothers in the debates in the public assembly, or in war, or in 
the athletic games (Philostrat. vit. Apoll. Tyan., v,14). They also used to tell them 
the beautiful myths that served instead of past history to the Greeks. So that even 
in those days ‘‘nursery tales” (rv7Gdv ior) were as much of an institution as they 
used to be with us (Hipp. maj., p. 286). 
When in his sixth or seventh year the boy went to school, his first teacher was the 
so-called ypaypaticthe or ypaupatodiddcxaroc, or simply didécxadtoc. This teacher 
usually kept his school within doors, often, however, in the open portico of some

  public edifice, or at times in the open air under a tree or in some quiet corner. In 
the Anthology (x1, p. 437) is an epigram which reads—

that is, “I pity Diotimos, who sits among the rocks and drills the boys in the 
alphabet.” 
Although the State may have desired that all boys attend school, yet it did not 
supply buildings for that purpose, and as a rule did not pay the teachers’ salaries. 
Only after the times of Alexander do we find provision in Athens for supporting 
teachers. Allschools were under private management. They naturally varied much 
in efficiency of teachers, in equipment, and in the social standing of the families 
that sent their children to the schools. One can easily imagine an Athenian school 
presided over by one teacher whose only book was a collection of excerpts from 
Homer, and his only other material equipment one stool, one waxen tablet, and one 
harp. But there were other schools with a number of teachers and with good equip- 
ment. Such a school does Demosthenes describe (On the Crown, 258), referring to 
the youthful days of his antagonist, Aischines, whose father was a school-teacher, 
In some of these schools the number of pupils was very large. Herodotos (v1, 27), 
for instance, mentions a school of 120 boys in the town of Chios in 494 B. C. The 
roof of the school fell in and all the boys were killed except one. The school of 
Stratonikos, the music teacher, will serve as an example of a small school. The 
room in which he held school was adorned by the statues of the nine muses and 
Apollon. He had but two pupils, but when asked, ‘‘How many have you in your 
school?” replied, ‘“‘ Twelve, for the gods are with me” (dédexa avy Beoic). 
On an ancient vase, the so-called Duris vase, we find a school scene painted. Some 
of the pupils are engaged in reading, others are listening, others writing. The 
teachers are seated on large chairs with backs to them; the pupils are standing, or 
seated on low stools. Musical instruments and other objects are hanging on the 
wall. 
The young boy did not go to school unaccompanied. As soon as he was old enough 
to leave the protecting care of mother and nurse he was put under charge of a peda- 
gogue. It was the duty of the pedagogue to accompany the child wherever he went. 
On the Duris vase we see a pedagogue in the school. He watched over the boy at 
all times, took care that he developed proper habits, civil manners, etc. He accom- 
panied him to school, to his music teacher, to the teacher of calisthenics. He car- 
ried his books and waxen tablets and harp. He selected the boy’s companions, and 
did not allow him to speak with strangers or with others that might in any way 
harm him. The pedagogue was generally a kind old man—a tried servant. In art 
he is represented as bald with wrinkled forehead, wearing a long chiton belted 
at the waist, and over this a loose flowing mantle. He generally carried a long staff 
with a crooked top. 
The young boy went to school at sunrise and often spent the entire day there, with 
the exception of ashort pause at midday foriunch. (Thuk., vu, 29; Aisch. Timarch., 
12.) 
It is scarcely necessary to state that often rich parents kept a teacher in the house 
for their children. In Diogenes Laertios (Iv, 74) we read of how Diogenes of Sinope 
served as teacher in the house of Xeniades. He had been kidnapped by pirates, who 
sold him as a slave to Xeniades, and Xeniades kept him to teach his Dboys. 
The course of studies consisted of three branches—letters, music, and gymnastics 
These constituted the eyxtx/.1o¢ ratdeia, or circle of studies. Often the same teacher 
taught both letters and music in his school. Sometimes, however, the pupil took his 
letters in one school and his music in another. The gymnastic exercises were always 
taught in places fitted out especially for that purpose. It seems that up to about 
his twelfth year the young scholar spent most of his study time at music and letters. 
For the Greeks the relationship between music and literature was very close. Of

  the two; music was naturally the older, and their cultivated literature grew out of 
their cultivated music. We are not surprised that they kept the two so closely 
united in their school curricula. 
As soon as the pupil learned to read he began to study the poets. He was 
obliged to copy special passages on his waxen tablet. Little use was made of what 
we call text-books. The pupil studied no lessons at home. Much of his literature 
he learned word for word by memory. The teacher helped him in this by reading 
with clear, firm pronunciation.one or two sentences and then having the pupil repeat 
them. It is not surprising then to read of old Athenians that knew many poems 
from beginning to end by memory. Most educated Athenians could quote readily 
and extensively from Homer and the other poets. Nikeratos (see Xen. Sympos., 11, 5) 
could repeat both Iliad and Odyssey from beginning to end. The reading books 
most used by the pupils were made up of selections from various poets put together 
into one volume, Such a collection was ai irofjxar tov Xeipwvoc, said to have been 
collected by the centaur and used in the education of Achilles. (Bernhardy, 
Griechische Literatur, 11, A, 535 ff.). 
These readers included excerpts from Phokyllides, Solon, Mimnermos, Theognis, 
and other lyric and gnomic poets. Probably also the dramatic poets were read, but 
the poets most preferred were Homer and Hesiod. Well known is the story about 
Alkibiades and the teacher. Alkibiades told the teacher that he wished to learn to 
read Homer. Tho teacher said that he had no copy of Homer. Thereupon Alkibiades 
rapped the teacher with his cane and went off to another school. (Plut. Alkibiad. 7.) 
They studied the prose writers as well as the poets. However, it seems that they 
read the poets during their younger school years and the prose writers later, During 
their ephebeia—that is, from their eighteenth to their twentieth year—they may have 
read prose authors more extensively. At least an inscription has been found, belong- 
ing indeed to a time later than the period we are now considering (see Corpus 
Inscriptionum Atticarum, 11, 992), but yet perhaps indicating a practice as early as 
our period, which contains a list of books which ephebi should read. The list con- 
tains the names of both poets and prose writers. Unfortunately the inscription is 
preserved only in a fragmentary condition. 
It is not difficult to understand why the Greeks kept musie and literature so 
closely allied. To the Greek the term music included not only what we understand 
by vocal and instrumental music, but also a knowledge of the laws of meter, of 
rhythm, of pronunciation, of enunciation, The musical instruments whose use was 
taught in the schools were the lyre and the flute. The flute, however, was not a 
favorite instrument. With the Greeks instrumental music was entirely subservient 
to the thought expressed in language, and its principal use was to accompany the 
chanted words. The flute, therefore, was regarded as an instrument that degraded 
the player, because it prevented him from using his voice. Moreover, they thought 
that it added no grace of pose and that it distorted the face. A myth used to be told 
about Athene, that she found a flute and began to play on it, but happening to seea 
reflection of herself in her polished shield she was disgusted at how the blowing on 
the flute made her mouth crooked and caused her eyes to protrude and her cheeks to 
swell out. So she threw it away as far as she could. A satyr found it, and made 
merry times with it. (Aristotel Politica, 8, 617.) Alkibiades was advised by his 
teacher not to talk so much if he wished to learn the flute. He replied: “In that 
case I do not wish to learn it; teach it to the Beecotians, who are too stupid to talk.” 
(Plut. Alkibiad., 2.) 
Greek education did not profess to produce specialists. Accordingly, such musical 
training as was given in the schools was very different from what was given to 
those that wished to become professional musicians. In the time of Aristotel, how- 
ever, this high idea was no longer upheld, and he complains that in his day most 
people learn music not as a means to culture, but to pleasure. 
How common it was for Athenians to have a certain amount of education seems 
to be shown by the sausage man in Aristophanes’s Knights (188 f.), where, to heighten

the boorishness of his character, he is made to say that he has no learning other than 
a slippery knowledge of the letters,

The Athenians worshipped not only intellectual and moral perfections, but also 
those of the body. They thought a sound body to be a worthy possession, and took 
special care to educate the bodies of their boys into strong, lithe, and sinewy ones. 
The younger boys received their physical training in the palestra. Their older broth- 
ers, above the age of 18, went to the gymnasia. The palestra was an inclosed space 
with room to throw the diskos and the javelin, to race, to wrestle. There were 
places where they could roll in the sand, bask in the sun, anoint themselves with 
oil, and bathe. 
Such was the education of soul, mind, and body that the boys of the Athenians 
enjoyed up to their eighteenth year. 
THE EPHEBI, 
At 18 years of age the Athenian became an ephebos, and as such entered upon a 
two years’ probation before being allowed to enjoy the rights of citizens. These two 
years of ephebia were devoted chiefly to a kind of military life, but at the same time 
intellectual training was not entirely neglected. However, they did not frequent 
any regularly established institutions for higher learning. No such institutions 
existed for them. The first representatives of a higher scientific culture in Greece— 
the philosophers, the artists, the architects, the physicians—did not found institu- 
tions that could be frequented by whosoever wished. They rather confined them- 
selves to a personal following and taught in such a way as suited intimate and per- 
sonal friendship. Even medicine was not taughtin a public way, but handed down 
traditionally and orally from old practitioners to favored pupils. Thus it was that 
such professions were, at least in earlier times, usually confined to certain families, 
as, e. g., that of medicine to the Asklepiads. 
Perhaps the first philosophical school that could be regarded as a systematic organ- 
ization for higher studies was the Pythagorean. Here we find definite studies— 
philesophy, mathematics, moral teaching, religious teaching, music, medicine, etc. 
But the teachings of the Pythagoreans were not accessible to all as a general means 
of education, They were intended only for the members of their own society. 
But in the second half of the fifth century before Christ a class of men arose who 
professionally offered themselves as teachers of higher studies, accepting as disci- 
ples whoever would pay them. Among these new professional teachers we find many 
remarkable men. But their methods and doctrines were not always blameless. 
Their successors, Sokrates, Platon, Aristotel, have not left us a favorable record of 
them. Their very name has become synonymous with deceit in matters of intel- 
lect—sophists. 
But the tendency of these sophists to gather groups of scholars around them grad- 
ually developed into the founding of real schools for higher learning. Platon and 
his disciples met in the grove called the academy, where Platon had caused suitable 
buildings to be erected for the benefit of the students. This academy became ina 
true sense a fixed and well-established school. Likewise did the Peripatetics found 
aschool, establishing themselves in the gardens and buildings which Theophrastos 
gave them. The Epicureans lived in a large house bequeathed to them by their 
founder. We have thus the first settlings of scholars into what we may call institu- 
tions of higher learning. 
These schools increased the reputation which Athens had long been acquiring as 
being the center of culture in Greece. This intensity of education attracted young 
men from beyond the confines of Greece proper even as early as the time of Isokrates. 
In his day youths came from ‘Sikelia.and Pontos and other places” to be educated 
in Athens. (mepi’Avridécewc, 224.) It must not be forgotten, however, that they 
   
-P-A-G-E-356
276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
came to Athens not as though it were the only center of education, but merely 
because it was the most famous center. 
In these institutions rhetoric, poetry, logic, dialectics, metaphysics, pure mathe- 
matics, the natural sciences, etc., were taught. But professional schools also began 
to exist. The Asklepiads founded two famous schools of medicine—an empirical 
school at Knidos, and a philosophical school of medicine at Kos. This school of 
Kos produced Hippokrates, the first great scientific physician of the Greeks. 
Of the natural sciences, geography was one of the first to be cultivated. On 
account of the practical knowledge gained by traveling for the sake of trade, as 
well as the information gotten by coming into contact with Phwnicians and others, 
geography had made respectable progress in the fourth century before Christ. 
Pytheas, who according to Bougainville (Memoires de P Académie des Inscriptions, 
x1x, 148) flourished before Aristotel, made use of astronomical observations to fix 
localities. He had voyaged as far north at least as England. 
Geographical maps are of ancient origin. The earliest one mentioned in Greek lit- 
erature is accredited by Strabon (I, 17) to Anaximandros, of Miletos, a disciple of 
Thales. Thirty years after the death of Anaximandros, Aristagoras, tyrant of 
Miletos, came to Sparta to persuade King Kleomenes to engage in war with the ene- 
miesof Aristagoras. He brought with him a map of the countries.of Asia which he 
wished to induce Kleomenes to invade. 
SPREAD OF GREEK EDUCATION IN ALEXANDRIAN TIMES. 
  The armies of Alexander subjected the whole eastern world to the Greco-Macke- 
donian sway. The numerous smaller kingdoms that sprang into existence out of 
his-vast conquests all claimed to be Greek, and with a certain violence of fate took 
to Greek culture and habits and education. Thus did the whole eastern world 
become Hellenistic if not Hellenic, having centers of learning and schools of litera- 
ture and philosophy at Athens, Alexandreia, Pergamon, Rhodes, Byzantion, Tarsos, 
and many other places. 
The scholars of this period were not creative, but rather reflective. They did not 
produce great masterpieces of poetry or art, nor did they devise new systems of 
philosophy. They were scholars and critics, rather than original makers. They 
were students and codifiers. They gathered together the wisdom of their fore- 
fathers. This they transmitted to posterity. In Alexandrian times higher education 
concerned itself chiefly with seven branches—philosophy, rhetoric, dialectics, math- 
emathics, geometry, astronomy, and music. Athens was the most famous seat of 
philosophy, and Alexandreia of philology. 
Elementary schools during this period must have been very similar to the same 
schools of the preceding period. Most of them were private affairs. The gramma- 
todidaskalos opened a school wherever he could succeed in getting a few boys 
together. Girls received their elementary education at home. Women, however, 
were not entirely debarred from the advantages of higher education. It seems that 
they sometimes frequented the schools. And we have instances, even, of women 
teaching in these schools. Of these Hypatia is a well known example. 
It may be that provision was occasionally made for the educating of children of 
such parents as could not afford to pay the school expenses. We possess a highly 
interesting inscription from the island of Teos describing details relative to a school 
in that city in the third century before Christ. (See Bulletin de Correspondence 
Hellenique, p. 110 ff., and Dittenberger, Sylloge Inscr., Grac., 349.) The inscription 
records the fact that Polythrous, a Teian, gave to his city 34,000 drachmas to be 
used for the educating of boys and girls. He provides for the yearly appointment 
of three teachers of letters ypayparodiddoxador, with salaries of 600, 550, and 500 
drachmas each, for two pedotribes, one music teacher, a teacher of archery, and a 
teacher of the use of weapons—in all, eight instructors. The pupils were to be 
divided into three grades, of which the third was to consist of ephebi. 
This instance of giving money for purposes of common education was not an iso-

  lated case. Perhaps such gifts were not unusual. Among the inscriptions found at 
Delphi (Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique, v, pp. 157 ff.) is one commemo- 
rating a gift of money from Attalos II, King of Pergamon, to the Delphians. From 
the interest of this money at 6} per cent, the community had a yearly income of 
1,260 drachmas, which they expended in teachers’ salaries. 
THE SCHOOLS OF ATHENS. 
From the middle of the second century before Christ down to the end of the first 
century after Christ, the schools in Athens flourished, and were frequented by many 
from outside of Greece proper. But in the second century after Christ they acquired 
new fame from the fact that, beginning with Hadrian (117-138), the schools of Athens 
came to be specially patronized by the Emperors of Rome. The Emperors estab- 
lished a number of salaried positions to be filled by teachers of philosophy and 
rhetoric. These positions were called @pévoc or “chairs.” It seems that the first to 
occupy such a throne and receive a salary from the Government was the philosopher 
Lollianos, who taught during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). In the time of 
Mareus Aurelius (161-180) there existed four chairs of philosophy, the Platonists, 
Peripatetics, Stoics,and Epicureans having one each. Each professor received a 
salary of 10,000 drachmas. (See Buchsenschutz, Besitz und Erwerb im Griechischen 
Alterthume, p. 567.) 
These different professors were absolutely independent of each other. The lec- 
tures were not all given in any one building set apart for that purpose. There was 
no governing head to bind the teachers together into one body or faculty, although 
we do hear of the office of exéarne, or ‘ director,” filled in the time of Marcus Aure- 
lius by Herodes Attikos. The epoptes seems to have been consulted in the appoint- 
ment of the professors, an honor later allowed to the Areopagos. - 
The system of teaching by dialogue, which was prevalent in the earlier schools of 
Athens, gradually gave way to the method of teaching by lectures. These lectures 
were supplemented by exercises done by the students, similar to the students’ work 
in modern seminaries. 
In those days Athens possessed many celebrated teachers, such as Cassios Longinos 
the walking museion, Proheresios, Proklos. This last scholar, in the fifth century 
after Christ, kept bright the luster of the Platonic school of Athens. 
As Christianity began to take gradual possession of the city of Pallas, there came 
no remarkably bitter conflict between the teachers of the dying paganism and the 
new Christianity. Both met on the common ground of Greek wisdom. Now a 
Christian, now a pagan would fill the same thronos. Still in Athens, as elsewhere, 
a crisis had to come, and the teachers of the old succumbed to the power of the new. 
How thoroughly Athens, after her political downfall, continued to be a city of 
letters is illustrated in a way not entirely complimentary to its inhabitants. In the 
year 267 A.D., when the Heruli overran much of southern Europe, they came to 
Athens and captured the city. A story says that, after plundering the city of what- 
ever the northern barbarians thought worth carrying off, they collected an immense 
pile of books together and were about to burn them. But one of their number 
advised them not to do so, saying that it would be better to leave their books to the 
Athenians, because people who spend their time with books will never be warriors, 
and therefore will never be dangerous to such as the Heruli. 
In these philosophic schools of Athens the tendency was not any longer to dis- 
cover new truths, but rather to interpret old ones; not to create new sciences, but to 
study the sciences handed down from the masters. These teachers identified, classi- 
fied, and labeled (so to speak) the specimens of science and truth that they had 
inherited from past scholars. 
They were not regardless of popular fame. They took care to have a large num- 
ber of hearers. They did not come into such personal contact with their students 
as did Sokrates and Platon and Aristotel. This tendency toward popularization came  
-P-A-G-E-358
  278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
immediately after the passing away of the great masters, Theophrastos, the suc- 
cessor of Aristotel, taught to an audience of from 1,000 to 2,000 disciples. Stilpnon 
of Megara used to count among his hearers many a ¢raipa. And these éraipac were 
not the least intelligent of his hearers. 
A vivid and attractive picture of academic life in Athens in the fourth century 
has been preserved tous by St. Gregory Nazianzene. (Operat, pp. 327, 328, ed. Morelli.) 
The arrival of a new student was quite an event. A sharp lookout was continually 
kept for neweomers. They were discovered even before landing, or immediately 
thereupon. The crowd of students that first got possession of the new arrival 
enrolled him into their special coterie, whether he wished it or not. They first 
entertained him at one of their favorite haunts or at the house of a previous 
acquaintance of his, or of a relative or fellow countryman. They initiated him in 
quite a rough way, making him the butt of jokes, raillery, and threats. The initia- 
tion ended by sending him to get a good regulation bath. Then they brought him 
to call on the professors, and make arrangements for attending lectures. 
Not only new students but new professors also were obliged to submit to the dis- 
comforts of initiation. At least the historian Olympiodoros describes an odd series 
of events as happening on the occasion of the appointment of the teacher Leontios, 
(See Geographi Greci Minores, 1, pp. 461-462.) 
It is clear, therefore, that these later Greek students were sufficiently boisterous 
and troublesome. Not only at Athens did they act thus, but likely in all the schools 
of the Empire. The law students seem to have been especially prone to such dis- 
turbances. The Synod of Troullos in 691 had to take cognizance of them. The 
seventy-first canon of that synod forbade them in future from following heathenish 
practices, from organizing into theater parties, from celebrating the “kylistre,” 
and from wearing a dress different from that worn by other people. 
THE SCHOOLS OF ALEXANDREIA.! 
Under the Ptolemies the new Hellenism flourished in Alexandreia. Indeed, so 
important in the literary life and culture of those days was Alexandreia that it gave 
its name to the period, and we speak of all Greek culture of that time as Alexandreian. 
In the city of Alexandreia the centers of this activity in higher education were the 
library and the mouseion. 
The library was not merely a collection of books, but was an institute for higher 
philosophical and philological learning. Founded by Ptolemy Soter, it grew ro rap- 
idly that under Ptolemy Philadelphos it already contained 500,000 volumes. 
As Athens was the center of philosophical teaching, and Rhodes of rhetoric, ete., 
so at Alexandreia the chief study was philology. Here studied and taught Aris- 
tophanes of Byzantion and Aristarchos of Samothrake, not to mention others also 
famous even down to the present day. 
The mouseion was a school of arts and sciences. The studies chiefly pursued there 
were those not provided for in the library, viz, the natural sciences, experimental 
sciences, pure and applied mathematics, and medicine. 
The school of medicine became famous throughout the world, especially for its 
surgery. 
Not far from the mouseion was a zoological garden, in which were kept animals 
from all parts of the known world, as objects of study. There was also a botanical 
garden, in which strange plants were cared for and acclimatized. Astronomy was 
studied and observatories fitted up for this science. Eratosthenes discovered a

method of correcting the faulty chronological system then in use. Here it was that 
Euklid composed his Elements of Geometry, which we still use. 
When Christianity took possession of Alexandreia, both library and mouseion were 
still flourishing; and many of the first and most learned of the Christians studied 
in these institutions. Christianity saw nothing fundamentally repugnant in them, 
and they continued to exist, with some opposition, to be true. Both library and 
mouseion flourished for almost a thousand years. The library seems to have come 
to an end only in the year 642 when Alexandreia fell under the sway of the Caliphs. 
During this long period of existence these institutions often suffered materially. 
Numbers of books perished in the fires on the occasion of the capture of the city by 
Julius Cesar. Again in the time of the Emperor Aurelian the entire quarter called 
the Brucheion was burned during a riot, and much school property destroyed, 
The influence of Alexandreia on letters and culture has been incalculable. It is 
not an exaggeration to believe the words we read in Athenmos (rv, 184) that at one 
time Alexandreia taught the world. ’AAefavdpeic eiow of maWeboavtes xdvtac rode

THE SCHOOL OF PERGAMON.! 
  Pergamon after the division of the Empire of Alexander was chosen by Lysimachos 
. to be the storehouse of his wealth. The city was conveniently situated, and its 
citadel was one of the strongest. Lysimachos appointed Philetwros of Bythenia to 
be custodian of the treasure and commandant of the city. But Philetwxros, taking 
advantage of the war between Lysimachos and Selevkos, declared himself independ- 
ent. The successors of Philetzros increased the territory of the city, and finally in 
the year 241 B. C., Attalos I, after having successfully driven the terrible invaders, 
the Gauls, out of his territory, assumed to himself the title of king. 
The Kings of Pergamon were almost as remarkable as the Ptolemies for their 
patronage of learning and art. In fact, they became bitter and open rivals of the 
Kings of Egypt. In this respect, it is said that the name of pergamenian paper, or 
parchment for vellum, comes from the fact that when the Ptolemies, through jeal- 
ousy of the school and scholars of Pergamon, forbade the exportation of Egyptian 
papyros into the Kingdom of Pergamon, the Pergamenians were then obliged to 
employ writing material of some other kind, and turned to vellum, whose mode of 
preparation they so improved, and which they used in such large quantities, as to 
give their name to the material forever. (See Plinius, Hist. Nat., xr, 11, and Das 
Antike Buchwesen, von Theodor Birt, Berlin, 1882, pp. 46-126.) 
This strong rivalry between the two schools and the determination of the two 
dynasties to acquire for their libraries every book known caused the making of a 
number of spurious works. Ifa certain writing of a favorite classic author was not 
to be found in any part of the Greek world, some clever scholar would often succeed 
in manufacturing a counterfeit copy and selling it to one of the libraries at a high 
price. (See Galenosin Hippokrat. de Nat. Hom., 1, 17.) 
At Pergamon as at Alexandreia the chief studies were philology and philosophy. 
But history, mathematics, medicine, etc., had teachers and scholars also. 
Among the philologians the most noted was Krates of Kilikia, who became the 
founder of a special school of philology, the Kratetians, 7) Kparrevoc aipectc. Krates 
and his school were opposed by Aristarchos and others of the Alexandreian school, 
It is said that Krates and Aristarchos met at least once in dispute over their differ- 
ences. s 
The library collected in Pergamon must have been very large, because Mark 
Antony is said to have sent 200,000 volumes as a present to Kleopatra, to replace the 
books burned by the soldiers of Julius Cesar.

  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
HIGHER EDUCATION IN OTHER CITIES, 
We must not allow ourselves to think that the few schools we have already men- 
tioned were the only important ones for Greek culture. There were very many other 
centers of higher education in the immense territory that had now become more or 
less Hellenic. In Antioch we find, as in Alexandreia, a library and a mouseion. 
But the school of Antioch rose to its highest fame after it had become Christian. 
As far west as Marseilles a school for higher learning flourished. In Rome the num- 
ber of Greek teachers was legion. When Amilius Paulus conquered Perseus, the 
Makedonian King, he brought the magnificent library of the conquered monarch to 
Rome, regarding it as the most valuable part of the spoils. It was the first large 
library that Rome ever contained. 
In the east schools existed everywhere—at Rhodes, at Byzantion, at Tarsos, ete. 
Strabo tells us that the inhabitants of Tarsos surpassed the Athenians and Alex- 
andreians and every other people in philosophy and other general culture, and that 
they had schools for all kinds of intellectual training. Tovatiry 62 roic évddde avOpiroig

At Rhodes there was a famous school of oratory and rhetoric. The school existed . 
as early as the time of Demosthenes, and perhaps was founded by his great rival, 
Zischines, who at least taught in Rhodes. This school became celebrated in the 
first century before Christ. It was much in favor with the young Romans, and 
Cesar, Brutus, Cassius, and other celebrated men of Rome studied there. 
CONDITION OF EDUCATION FROM THE TIME OF THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF THE 
GREEKS DOWN TO THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPOL. 
BYZANTINE HELLENISM: 
Constantinopol having become the capital of the eastern portion of the great 
Roman Empire, Constantine and his successors employed all tangible means to 
increase its magnificence and importance. It soon became the political center of 
the Christian world. The Emperors recklessly plundered other parts of their vast 
domain in order to enrich and beautify their chosen city. 
The schools that hitherto had been focuses of higher learning at Athens and 
Alexandreia and Beryttos, etc., still, indeed, continued to exist, but grew weaker 
and weaker, not being able to compete with the attractions of Constantinopol, and, 
moreover, not being in favor with either church or state, because of being still 
un-Roman and still pagan. 
Accordingly these schools gradually decayed. The school of Beryttos (Beyroot), 
famous as a school of law, lost its buildings in the earthquake of 551 and never 
rose again into existence. 
In the reign of Justinian the schools of Athens were abolished by imperial decree 
of the year 529. (Malalas, 11, p.187.) Monastery schools were, perhaps, established 
to supply their place. It may be said, however, that the neo-Platonic school was 
the only one still in active operation, and this had already lost its importance. 
Teachers and students were but few. 
It must not be forgotten that although the court of Byzantion was Latin in origin 
and in name, yet it was from the beginning Greek in the language and traditions 
of the people. Latin, indeed, was the official language of the court, but not of the 
inhabitants. The new Christian civilization, though hostile to Hellenic paganism, 
was not hostile to Hellenic philosophy and wisdom, which it had adopted and 
appropriated. A new epoch of Hellenism had begun, Christian Hellenism, which 
after a time was destined in some ways to eclipse even classic Hellenism.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. 281 
  It is certain that during all the long ages from Theodosios and Justinian down to 
the fall of Constantinopol, the Christians of the East were superior to the Chris- 
tians of the West in education. This is exemplified by such facts as the great 
eodifying of the laws in the time of Justinian, the councils of the church, which 
were held in the East, the various heresies that arose among the Eastern peoples 
(people that do not think are not liable to fall into heresy), the many scholars who 
continually came to the West with Eastern lore and books, the Byzantine learning 
which the Arabs brought into Europe, instances of kings and princes who sent 
their daughters to the Eastern capital to receive that polish which the Western 
world could not give, Western scholars who went to the East to study despite the 
jealousy between the two great churches. These facts all go to show the higher 
position which the East held in culture and knowledge. 
In 1240 John Bassing, archdeacon of St. Albans, brought a number of Greek books 
into England from the East, from Athens. 
It must not be thought that the transition from paganism to Christianity was in 
every respect a violent one. A good illustration of how easy such a transition 
became in some cases is seen in the writer Nonnos, who, during the first half of the 
fifth century as a pagan writer, produced profane works, taking his inspiration from 
classic antiquity, and creating such monstrosities as the Dionysiaka, and who later 
as Christian added to his writings a paraphrase of the Gospelof St. John. (Kechly, 
De Evangelii Joannei paraphrasi a Nonno facta. Zurich, 1860.) 
The educated Christians would have had no ill-feeling whatsoever against the 
ancient learning if they did not fear its undue influence over the less educated. As 
an illustration of their love for classic truth and beauty take St. Basil’s treatise on 
the use of the pagan authors. (Sermo de legendis libris gentilium; ed. Migne, pp. 
563 ff. 
Y EDUCATION IN CONSTANTINOPOL. 
According to Georgios Kodinos (de Origg. Constant. ed. Paris, p. 42), Constan- 
tine founded in his new city an institution for higher learning. As described by 
Kodinos, this institution bears a certain resemblance to a modern university. For 
the purposes of this school Constantine built a special edifice, the Tetradision. 
Twelve teachers lived in it, all of whom were in orders. The director of the school 
had also the care of the library, and of the church archives. Both director and 
professors were called ccumenical teachers, oixovyevikol diddoxado. The young 
Julian,' who, in 361 became Emperor, may have studied in this school. At least 
when about 20 years of age he came to Constantinopol from Kappadokia to study. 
Constantine gave him the best opportunities to study, but forbade him to attend the 
lectures of the pagan Libanios lest this teacher might exercise an evilly alluring 
influence on the religion of the enthusiastic young Hellenist. The fact that 
Libanios taught for a time in Constantinopol shows that there were other excellent 
schools beside the one in the Tetradision. Julian, after becoming Emperor, enriched 
the library of Constantinopol by adding his own private collection of books to it. 
This library was probably the one which the director of the Tetradision had care of. 
The Emperor Valens (364-378) appointed seven antiquarii to copy manuscripts here. 
The Emperor Theodosios, who also cared much for his capital city and who despoiled 
many another place of its objects of art and wealth in order to beautify and enrich 
Constantinopol, likewise busied himself to make it a more noted center of educa- 
tion. He reorganized, remodeled, and reinvigorated the school which Constantine 
had founded. It came into a new existence by virtue of a decree of the year 425. 
The school exercises were held in a large edifice called the Kapitolion. Ten gram- 
matici taught the Latin language, which was still the official language of the Goy- 
ernment. Ten other grammatici taught the Greek language. Three professors 
taught Roman oratory, and five sophists gave instruction in Greek rhetoric. One 
professor taught philosophy, and two taught law.

    282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
These professors were not allowed to teach in private schools, nor indeed in any 
other school than the university; such teaching was thought to be beneath their 
profession. After twenty years of teaching a‘professor received the title of ‘‘Comes” 
of the first order, and was enrolled among the nobility. 
In the fire of 476 a library of 120,000 volumes is said to have been destroyed by the 
burning of a wing of the Tetradision, This shows what a quantity of books were 
already in Constantinopol. A story says that in this fire there perished a manuscript 
of the Iliad and Odyssy, written on serpent skin in letters of gold. 
In the year 740 the Emperor Leon of Isavria closed the chief school of Constanti- 
nopol. He did so because having requested the faculty to render an opinion con- 
cerning Ikons, the faculty declared that the use of Ikons should be continued, an 
opinion which did not suit the purposes of the Ikonoklast. (See Walch, Geschichte 
der Ketzereien, Vol. x, p. 231). Later and unreliable tradition asserts that he caused 
the school to be burned, together with professors and apparatus and library. 
During the reign of Michael III (842-867), the last Emperor of the House of Leon, 
the university was reestablished after having been closed for more than a hundred 
years. The hundred years that fall within this period are among the darkest in the 
intellectual life of the Byzantine Empire, and yet there was not even then absolute 
dearth of noteworthy scholars. At the beginning of this period we find Ioannes, of 
Damaskos, whom the synod of 754 cursed in his grave. Scholastic philosophy, which 
flourished so greatly in the West at a later date, owes very much to Ioannes of 
Damaskos. The Greek Church, up to the present time, regards him as its greatest 
dogmatic theologian. 
The rebirth of learning in the time of Michael III was due in large measure to 
Bardas, the coregent with Michael. But even before the reign of Michael this 
renaissance had really begun. The Emperor Theophilos (829-842) had opened a 
philosophicai and mathematical school, and located it in one of his palaces, the 
Magnaura. A strange event happened in his reign, The Kalif Al Mamoun sent to 
Theophilos a special embassy, asking that the teacher Leon be allowed to leave Con- 
stantinopol and go to Al Mamoun’s capital city to teach. The Greek Emperor was 
surprised to learn that he possessed such a teacher. He made inquiries and discoy- 
ered that Leon was teaching inasmall private school. Theophilos refused to permit 
the newfound treasure to escape him. He immediately appointed a suitable place 
for him to teach in. Leon afterwards did much in encouraging the founding of 
schools, not only in Constantinopol, but in other parts of the Empire. He was of 
much assistance to Bardas in this work. 
In the year 1045 the Emperor Constantios Monomachos interested himself in a 
school for higher studies. Whether this was a new foundation or a reorganization 
of the school already existing is hard to ascertain. There were some worthy pro- 
fessors in this school, among them Michael Psellos, who occupied the chair of 
philosophy. He taught Plato with success. Among his hearers were not only 
Byzantines, but also Arabs and Western Christians. 
One of the principal departments in this school was that of law. This law school 
did good work in preserving and spreading a correct knowledge of Rommo-Byzan- 
tine law. This was really the first establishment of a genuine law school as we now 
understand such a school. It preceded the school of the West, that of Bologna, by 
half a century. Zachariae von Lingenthal, a famous authority on Byzantine laws, 
declares that the makers of the law school of Bologna were influenced by the model 
at Constantinopol. The law school of this academy of Constantinopol was founded 
by virtue of a “novella” rept rod vouogidacoc. Its first director, vouodtdaz, was 
Toannes Xiphilinos, of Trapezous, who later became Patriarch of Constantinopol. 
The numerous law manuscripts still extant from the eleventh and twelfth centu- 
ties show how fruitful this school was. (See Geschichte der Byzantinischen Litera- 
tur, von Karl Krumbacher, p. 606.) 
This revival of learning came to a sudden end in 1204. In that year the wild 
western Franks took possession of the city. ‘heir rude contempt for all that was

concerned with literature, or the politer culture of the East, is fully testified to by 
Niketas Choniates (p. 382, ed. Paris), He tells of how the soldiery carried writing 
material and books through the city, mocking the Greeks as being a nation of book 
men. 
After the expulsion of the Latins in 1261, the cause of education was again patron- 
ized by the Emperors of the house of Paleologos. But the Empire was in the 
way to death, and these late scholars’ chiet good work was that they preserved what 
was left of literature, and carefully handed it over to the reawakening West, which 
received it and cherished it, and through it developed into what it now is. 
THEOLOGY. 
  European theology as a science owes itself to Christianity. Theological science, 
as met with in the Byzantine Empire, and as crystallized into the teachings of all 
Christian denominations of modern Europe, especially, however, the teachings of 
the Greek and Latin churches, is a product of the meeting of two streams—Christ’s 
divine teachings and Greek wisdom. 
Down to the twelfth century theological literature, and church literature in gen- 
eral, stood higher in the East than in the West. There was in the East no violent 
break between the patristic literature and the Byzantine ecclesiastical literature. 
In the West, however, there was such a break, caused by the invasions of the barba- 
rians and the destruction of the old Latin civilization, 
THE TEACHING OF GRAMMAR, 
Since the habit of forming all literary style on the basis of the classic writers 
still continued to prevail, it was natural for the Byzantines to continue to use the 
old grammarians of the Atticistic period as their teachers in the use of words, phrases, 
and constructions. 
During this entire period we find the old works of Dionysios Thrax, Apollonios 
Dyskolos, and Herodianos used as the authorities in grammatical teaching. These 
works were not read in their original form so much as in epitomes and commenta- 
ries. Among the best known commentaries were those of Theodosios of Alexandreia 
made in the fourth century, and those of Ioannes Philoponos, Ioannes Charax, and 
Georgios Cheroboskos made in the seventh century. These books continued in use 
down to the fall of Constantinopol. 
THE STUDY OV RHETORIC, 
The art of composition was a specially beloved study. Accordingly the number 
of manuscripts of text books on rhetoric is very large. Most of them are of little 
value. They are all outgrowths of such works as those of Hermogenes and Aphtho- 
nios, who flourished in Roman times. These text books follow the old system in 
vogue with rhetoricians of the preceding period. They train the student to com- 
pose various kinds of themes in the following order: Fables, uifov; narratives, 
Oimnyhuara ; chrie, ypeiac; refutations, avacxevai ; argumentations, catackevat ; yyopar or 
enlargements on sententious sayings, and character sketches, 79orovia. (See Walz, 
Rhetores Greci, Stuttgartiw, 1832-1836, or Spengel, Rhetores Greci, Leipzig, 1853- 
1856. 
IISTORY. 
No other people of Europe possess such along and unbroken series of historical 
literature as do the Greeks. It begins with Herodotos, in the fifth century B. C., 
and comes down to Laonikos Chalkondylas, whose ten books of histories end with 
the year 1463, and from Chalkondyles down to the present day. Much of this his- 
torical matter has not yet been published, and most of it has not yet been critically 
examined, 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY. 
Byzantine culture did nothing for mathematics. Stephanos of Alexandreia, who 
lived in the time of the Emperor Herakleios (610-641), was the last of the old line of 
mathematicians. After him up to the age of the Palzrlogs we find no writers or 
teachers skilled in these sciences. This Stephanos was public professor, oicovwevixdg 
6iacxaioc in the University of Constantinopol. 
With the efforts at intellectual revival that took piace under the Palewologs, after 
their return to Constantinopol in 1261, there came also a new life into mathematical 
and astronomical studies. The principal impulse to these studies came at this time 
from the Arabs and Persians. Translations of Aravic and Persian works were made, 
and original works were written under Arabic and Persian inspiration. 
In the year 1325 Nikephoros Gregoras presented to the Emperor Andronikos 
Paleologos the details of a plan for the correcting and improving of the calendar. 
But the Emperor, fearing that the change might not be acceptable to his people, did 
not accept it. 
MEDICINE. 
  In the science and practice of medicine likewise the Byzantines made no important 
progress. The books from which they studied were the writings of the old masters, 
especially Hippokrates and Galenos, either entire or more usually in excerpts and 
epitomes. 
Nevertheless Alexandros of Tralles (525-605) produced a work on pathology in 
twelve books, in which he shows himself not only an intelligent follower of the 
masters but an independent thinker as well. 
In the seventh century we find Pavlos of Zgina, who wrote a handbook of medi- 
cine which contains much that was new, especially in surgery. This work was 
regarded as of such importance as to be translated into Arabic, and from Arabic 
into Latin. It has been translated into English by Francis Adams (three volumes, 
London, 1845-1847). 
Toward the end of the thirteenth century Nikolaos Myrepsos wrote a book of pre- 
scriptions which was thought to be so useful that it enjoyed great reputation in 
the West, and held its place as a well recognized ‘‘ codex pharmaceuticus ” of the 
faculty of Paris as late as the beginning of the seventeenth century. 
Among the working classes it is quite probable that but few of the women could 
read. Among the men, however, such ability may not have been uncommon, since 
school and teachers, public and private, lay and clerical, were plentiful. Among 
the middle and upper classes general education, éyxv«Avog wacdeia, was a not uncommon 
acquisition for women as well as for men. 
CONDITION OF EDUCATION AMONG THE GREEKS FROM THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPOL 
IN 1453 DOWN TO THE WaR OF LIBERATION IN 1821, 
The fall of Constantinopol naturally affected the condition of education in the 
Byzantine Empire. The Turks, though not always openly hostile to Byzantine edu- 
cation and culture, looked upon it with disdaining indifference. For them the Koran 
was sufficient. Yet they did adopt some of the outward and moribund forms of 
Byzantine culture. For example, they accepted Byzantine architecture in the build- 
ing of their mosques. They did not interfere in any direct way with the education 
of such Christian inhabitants of the Empire as could pay liberally for the privilege. 
They did not refuse to sell permission to found schools; they did not silence the 
teachers, nor did they forbid the transcription of books. Yet the simple fact that 
these Christians wore not free men; that they lived under a Government which they 
regarded as a punishment from God, and which treated them as merely tolerated 
aliens; the fact that no career was, under ordinary circumstances, open to the scholar 
save that which the church afforded; the fact that the people were plunged in the 
abjectest poverty; the fact that it was a dangerous thing for a parent to make his 
children too attractive by education or otherwise, because he thus increased the risk 
of their being appropriated for some harem or band of eunuchs or janizaries—all
-P-A-G-E-365
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 285 
these facts weighed heavily on the cause of education. Every four years a certain 
number of small Christian boys were taken from their parents to be trained as jani- 
zaries. The very existence of this child tribute, the heart-breaking Mavdouéfaua 
(see the drama of this name by Demetrios Kampouroglos) and the tax of one-tenth 
of the male children for employment in various offices, threw such a foreboding 
gloom over family life that education could not well flourish, even if there were no 
other causes to prevent it. The Pedomazoma dates from about 1650. 
Instead of not understanding the humble condition of education among the Greeks 
under Turkish rule, we are astonished to find so much of education there ; astonished at 
the vitality of old Hellenism which did not entirely succumb even to Mahometanism.! 
Hellenism seems to be one of these mighty forces of nature which when forcibly 
stopped in its regular flow will burst out in outlets into other directions. Thus one 
effect of the enslavement of the Eastern Empire was the great exodus of scholars 
from Constantinopol and Asia Minor and Thessalonika and Sparta, etc., into Italy 
and the other countries of western Europe. Thisstream of learning, oozing westward 
from its oriental sources, burst forth in Europe into a myriad of life-giving fountains, 
causing to spring up everywhere a new growth, a new zeal for the historic past, a 
new impulse and love toward things of beauty and truth, a new freshness and ambi- 
tion and humanitas—in a word, a revival, a rebirth, of Hellenism, the Renaissance. 
To follow these scholars from the East to the West and to examine into how they 
partook in bringing about the great revival would lead us away from our theme. 
Yet we can not say that their work was lost to their fatherland, because this power- 
ful civilization of Europe has never ceased to shine back toward the source whence 
it came, and in these later days, when liberty has again taken up her abode in some 
of her old Hellenic centers, scholars from Europe, heirs to classic and Byzantine 
Hellenism, have been found ready to bring back to its home fresh seeds of the 
ancient culture. Yea, when under the dawn of a new life a university was opened 
in Athens, Europe furnished some of its best professors.

However, although the scholars that migrated to Europe are outside of our pale, 
yet, since they are better known to us than are those who stayed in their native land, 
I make this reference to them here; they serve as samples of what high scholarship 
flourished in a country that could produce such men. For details concerning them 
one must go to the history of culture and education in Europe during those times. 
After the fall of Constantinopol the Greeks, as a nation in slavery, attracted very 
little attention in western Europe. In 1573 Martin Kraus, professor of Greek at 
Tubingen, moved by the correspondence that had been opened up between Protes- 
tant leaders and the ecclesiastics of the Greek Church, began to correspond with 
some Greek clergymen of Greece and Constantinopol. This correspondence he pub- 
lishes in his Turcogrecia. It is easy to see that the Greeks of that day were almost 
unknown eyen to him. He asks whether Athens still exists, ete. But his corre- 
spondence was soon followed by a general awakening of interest in the East, and 
gradually toward the end of the eighteenth century the Greeks were again favorably 
before the world. 
THE COMMON SCHOOL. 
(To Kowdv Sxodeiov.) 
  The schools of this period may be divided into two classes, the common or primary 
schools, and the Hellenic or advanced schools. 
Since there were very few careers open to the educated Christian except that of 
an ecclesiastical life, the school naturally came under the special protection of the 
church. The school was regarded as a kind of succursal to thechurch. Accordingly 
the books used were chiefly such books as were needed in the daily service of the 
church, such as the Ardorodoc, the Psalter, the Oxréyyoc, and the Méya ‘Qpoddyzov. 
The sum total of what one could learn in a common school consisted in ability to 
read the books of the church service, in knowing the elements of arithmetic, and 
ability to write. 
There were no buildings especially fitted out as schools for scholars of this class. 
They would assemble in the narthex of some church, perhaps, when their teacher was 
an ecclesiastic, or in the shop of some handicraftsman when he happened to be the 
school-teacher. They had no chairs, but sat crosslegged on mats or rugs laid on the 
floor. Their books were of course in manuscript, since the art of printing was not 
yet at their service. Each pupil usually had but one book. He was promoted toa 
higher grade by being allowed to take up a different book. The occasion on which 
a young boy was allowed to “change his book,” vai dvAAdda, as they used to say, 
was joyfully celebrated by his family and relatives. He was led in triumph from 
the school to his parents’ house accompanied by the teacher and his fellow-school- 
mates and his relatives. On arriving at the house all formally congratulated him 
and feasted and sang and danced in his honor. In the evening his mother sent to 
the teacher the gift of a fowl or eggs, or a piece of wearing apparel, to show the grat- 
itude of the family. (See Xpévog Neoddyov, p. 150.) 
The teacher was often a priest or deacon or other ecclesiastic, or the sacristan of 
the church, or a tailor or a shoemaker, or some other such handicraftsman who 
could both ply his trade and teach at the same time. 
The schools were generally held in the daytime, but in the communities where 
the pupils were engaged in labor during the day night schools were sometimes held. 
A reference to these occasional night schools is contained in a song which used to be 
sung in those days and is still widely known throughout Greek lands: 
Beyyapaxe pov Aaumps, 
éyye pov va reprare, 
Na mnyaive ord exoded, 
Na padaivo ypéupara, 
Tod Gcod 7a mpdnmara.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. 287 
THE HELLENIC SCHOOL. 
(Ld "EAAqvexdy BxdActov.) 
Along with the common schools there flourished another set of higher schools, 
called Hellenic. They took their name from the fact that in them the ancient Greek 
language, ‘EAAyvuKy yAGooa, was their chief study. In these schools the pupils studied 
ancient grammer and read and interpreted the ancient authors, both classical and 
ecclesiastical. Although the most of the boys that entered these schools, after finish- 
ing the course given in the common schools, were looking forward to a church career, 
yet there were others who intended to remain laymen, These Hellenic schools were 
of various degrees of excellence and thoroughness, according to their resources and 
the worth of the teachers they chanced to have. That some were of a high orderis 
evident from the eminence of the scholars they produced. We shall have occasion 
to mention some of these scholars later. Alexander Helladios, speaking of these 
schools (in his Status Praesens Ecclesie Orientalis, p. 42 ff.), praises them and 
honors them with the peculiar title of ‘‘Universitatule.” Schools of this high order 
existed in Constantinopol, Smyrna, Kydonia, Ioannina, Patmos, Athos, Thessalonika, 
and elsewhere. They were not universities, because they did not possess all of the 
schools that go to make up a studium generale, still some of the branches taught 
were handled as thoroughly as in contemporaneous western universities. (See 
Chassiotis, L’Instruction Publique, ete., p. 34.) 
After the fall of Constantinopol there grew up around the residence of the patri- 
arch a community of Greeks known in history as the Phanariotes, @avapira. They 
take their name from the quarter in which they lived, and the locality takes its name 
from a light-house, Savdpr, which stood there at the edge of the water of the Golden 
Horn. From these Phanariote families the Sultan chose Christian governors and 
other officers needed for the administration of Christian provinces. Phanariotes 
were also employed as interpreters, etc., for intercourse with European governments. 
Phanariotes and Patriarch were usually well treated by the Sultans and enjoyed 
many privileges. Though obsequious to the Mahometan Government, they always 
continued true to the traditions of their own race. They established in Phanari an 
educational institution called the Grand National School, 7) Meyédy rov Tévove yor.

This school had at times noted teachers and produced noted scholars. Theophilos 
of Korydala taught here when Kyrillos Loukaris was Patriarch. He has left us a 
bulky commentary on the writings of Aristotel. 
In 1804 this school was removed from Phanari to Kourou-Chesme, a suburb of 
Constantinopol. (See the Eédoud¢ for May 11, 1886.) But after a few years it was 
again brought back to Phanari, where it flourishes to-day, in a large and well- 
equipped edifice built especially for the purpose, and dedicated September 12, 1882. 
These prosperous and influential Phanariotes. patronized schools not only in Con- 
stantinopol, but also in other parts of the Empire. The Mavrokordatos family may 
be taken as an illustration, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who had studied in Padua 
and Bologna, became professor in a Greek school in Constantinopol founded by 
Manolakis, an important school, distinct from the patriarchal school, which also 
existed at that time. He wrote asnoteworthy treatise on the circulation of the 
blood, a Greek grammar, a text-book of rhetoric, a history of the Jews, history of 
Rome, etc. He encouraged the founding of schools and assisted according to his 
ability. He strove for the purification of the modern language and for its adoption 
as the literary medium. His children naturally followed his example. His oldest 
son was appointed to the position of hospodar of Wallachia, being the first Greek 
that ever occupied that office. One of his early acts as hospodar or governor was 
to establish a well-equipped school in Bucharest, and to found a printing 
establishment.

  288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Generosity in the cause of education was characteristic of other rich Greeks also, 
as well as of the Phanariotes; so that the number of schools in good standing 
throughout the Empire was really remarkable. We find schools flourishing at some 
time or other during this period at the following places: Arta in Epeiros, Ampelakia 
in Thessaly, Mount Athos, Athens, Bucharest, Chios, Constantinopol, Chalke of the 
Prinkipo Islands in the Sea of Marmora, Demitsana in the Peloponnesos, Jassy, 
Jerusalem, Ioannina, Kydonia of Asia Minor, Leghorn, Lakka of Delbino in Epeiros, 
Moscow, Malenik of Makedonia, Missolonghi, Nikomedeia of Asia Minor, Odessa, 
Patmos, Padua, Rodosto, Serre of Makedonia, Smyrna, Thessalonika, Tyrnabos, 
Tsaritsana, Triest, Venice, Vienna, etc. 
Some of the schools mentioned above were outside of Greek lands. They were 
established by the residents of the Greek colonies in these places. Some of them 
date back to before the fall of Constantinopol. Thus in Padua of Italy we find a 
Greek school existing in the year 1407. 
The above list contains only some of the more noted schools. Many a school 
existed and perished of which we have no record whatsoever. Everywhere through- 
out Greece one comes to places which the people of to-day call “the school,” 7d 
dacka2eio, although the locality contains no school or traces of school. The name 
is merely the memory of long ago. 
A good list of the schools flourishing in the eighteenth century is found in a gram- 
mar published in Venice by Géorgios Phatseas. It contains most of the prominent 
Greek schools of his time (Tewypagixy Tpaypariny tov baroéa). 
The school at Jerusalem was one of the oldest. It may be regarded as the contin- 
uation of the Movoriov, which the conquerer Saladin destroyed. 
In Smyrna, as in other large Greek cities, there existed often more than one Hellenic 
school. The most noted school of this city was the Evangelical school, EvayyeAcn) 
Zyorg. It was founded in 1743 by means of private contributions. It has hada 
successful career, and has done much for the advancement of learning among the 
Greeks of Asia Minor. It still flourishes. It possesses a splendid library and an 
archaeological museum. Since 1873 the school has published a periodical, the 
Movoéiov xat BibA1084Kn THe Hvayyedcxne SxoAqe. This periodical contains good arche- 
ological, historical, and philological material. 
The Island of Chios enjoyed more freedom than many other places in the Turkish 
Empire. On this account education had greater opportunity of spreading than else- 
where. There was no break in the chain of schools in this island from the time of 
the passing of the island into the hands of the Turks down to the massacre of 1821. 
Monks of the West vied with scholars of the Eastin diffusingeducation. During these 
four centuries we continually find Chians among the learned men of the time. 
Near the shores of the A.gean, on the coast of Asia Minor, opposite to the Island 
of Mytelene, there flourished a beautiful little Greek town, Kydonia, the village of 
the citron trees. But this town is known to us more for its school than for its 
beauty. The school was founded by Gregorios Saraphis. 
Among the young men that studied at Kydonia was Ambroise Firmin Didot. In 
the year 1817 he made an extensive tour through Greek lands, and, coming to Kydo- 
nia, he entered the school as a regular pupil. He brought with him a letter of 
introduction to Kaires, who was then professor there. The letter was from Koraes, 
Didot remained an intern of the school for two months. He was young and enthu- 
siastic and noble. He became the leading spirit in a society established by the 
students, all members of which agreed never to speak to each other except in Attic 
Greek. In his notes (Notes d’un voyage fait dans le Levant en 1816 et 1817, Paris, 
1821) he gives us a copy of the ‘‘vow” they took. These notes contain many delight- 
ful reminiscences of his sojourn among the fiery young Greeks of Kydonia. (See 
Annuaire des Etudes Grecques, 1876, p. 233 ff.) A few years later Didot sent to 
Kydonia a full printing outfit. 
In the monasteries at Mount Athos learning always held a certain footing; but it 
was available chiefly for monks only and their novices. In 1749, however, a change
-P-A-G-E-369
  
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 289 
took place. The monks of the monastery of Batopedion decided to open a school on 
amore liberal plan. They invited Neophytos Kavsokalybites to be its first scholarch. 
He accepted. Theschool wasasuccess. As one of the men who taught here, Evgenios 
Boulgares, of Kerkyra (1716-1806), may be mentioned. He wasa typical Greek scholar 
ofhisday. As classicist and Christian he translated two works into Greek—the Aineid. 
of Vergil and the Confessions of St. Augustine. He afterwards enjoyed the patron- 
age of the Empress Katharine and was made bishop of Kherson. 
Ioannina (Janina), known to us as the chief city in the country ruled over by the 
celebrated Ali Pasha at the beginning of the present century and often mentioned 
by Byron, was highly favored by schools. Epiphanios Hegoumenos, who in 1647 
founded a school in Athens, founded one at Ioannina in the same year. Later this 
school received other gifts and was a useful institution. 
In the year 1676 another school was established in Ioannina, the founder being 
Manos Ghionmas, who gave 20,000 ducats for that purpose. This school also received 
other gifts and became an excellent school. 
Still another was founded some years later by Simon Maroutsos. In this school 
Eygenios Boulgares taught for a time before going to Batopedion of Mount Athos, 
The schools of Ioannina are noted for the number of teachers they produced. 
In the mountain town of Demitsana, in the Peloponnesos, we find a school which 
since the year 1764 enjoyed the reputation of being one of the best schools of Greece. 
In this year the learned Agapios reorganized the school. Scholars came to it from 
all parts of the Peloponnesos. It has the glorious reputation of having educated 
Germanos, who afterwards, when bishop of Patras, was the first to unfurl the Greek 
flag and gave to the revolution of 1821 the character of a holy war for liberty and 
church. This same school educated Gregorios, who as patriarch of Constantinopol 
was murdered by the Turks in Easter week of 1822. 
After the fall of Athens into Turkish control we have very scanty data concerning 
the condition of education. But on account of the historic importance of the city 
it is worth while to collect as many facts as possible. 
The first reference to a school brings us to the year 1647, when Epiphanios Hegou- 
menos, a Greek of Venice, who had also contributed to education in Ioannina, 
founded a school in Athens. The reason why Epiphanios selected these two cities 
was probably because they were already in a certain way centers of education. In 
the following century the school of Epiphanios was still flourishing, as we find that in 
the year 1732 it received a gift from the Athenian Georgios Melos. This gift from 
Melos was in the form of a yearly income, and was intended to support one teacher 
and a small number of scholars. 
That there must have been some culture in Athens at this time is to be concluded 
from the account which Pere Babin, the Jesuit, has left us; for he highly praises the 
Jove of learning which he observed among the Athenians. This statement is in his 
Relation de ’Etat Présent d’Athénes, ancienne capitale de la Gréce * * * par 
Pere Babin. 1674. (It has been published by Spon, and also by Laborde.) 
Almost a century later Gregorios Soteres, a monk who had studied in Italy, 
returned to Athens and bought a house, which he converted into a school, where he 
himself taught the eyxbxdva Tpdupara. All of this-he did at his own expense, receiv- 
ing no salary and taking no fees from the pupils. When in 1782 he left Athens and 
went to Constantinopol, he dedicated his school to the community of Athens “to be 
and to be called a common academy of Greek learning, and to serve as a habitation 
for the successive teachers.” This school continued to exist up to the year 1812. It 
was situated in the middle of the city, near to the Tower of the Winds. (See the 
article in the 'E6doné¢ for November 10, 1885, on Ta év ’AOfvace xpHta Exoreia.) 
About the year 1750 or 1754 another Greek of Venice, Ioannes Dekas, established 
another school at Athens, and deposited in the treasury of the Aristocracy of Venice 
the sum of 2,000 ducats, from the interest of which the school was to be supported. 
He provided for one teacher, with a salary of 200 ducats, and for twelve scholars 
ED 97. 19   
 
-P-A-G-E-370
290 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. ' 
“who were to receive each 25 ducats yearly. This school flourished until 1797, when, 
by the fall of Venice (in this year Venice submitted to Bonaparte, and at his orders 
the Aristocracy was abolished and a provisional government established), it was 
deprived of its revenue. It did not cease to exist, however, but struggled along to 
the year 1805, when it received new life from support given to it by the monastery 
of the Mapypéyioroe Tatidpyat. (See the sigillion in Ta card roy Aotdiwov Tpyyépiov tov €. 
ind T. IL. AyyetorobAov év AD#vaic, 1865, vol. 11, p. 488.) With this new assistance the 
school continued to exist up to 1813 and perhaps later. (See Eédoydc, loc. cit.) 
In the year 1813 Petrakes, the hegoumenos of the Monastery of the Angels (ray 
*Acwpdzov), established a school of medicine in the monastery. The physician Diony- 
sios Pyrrhos was the teacher. From the revenues of the monastery twelve scholars, 
as well as the teacher, were supported. The school continued to exist until the out- 
break of the revolution in 1821. 
  DIDACTIC METHODS. 
In the common schools the methods used for inculeating knowledge were quite 
primitive. Each pupil had his task to perferm, and woe to him forall neglect. The 
punishment that awaited all ill success was the 94 ayyac, or the rod. Teacher and 
parents often repeated the philosophic Td £00 Byjxe axd rdv Mapddevoor, “The rod is 
“a gift of God.” The parent often allowed full penal jurisdiction over a trouble- 
some son, with the simple proviso Mévo ra Kéxnada yep, Adoxade, “but don’t break 
any bones.” (See Kondylakis’s [larotyac, cap. 1.) Each pupil prepared his task as 
best he could, either unaided or with the assistance of a more advanced pupil, a 
Tpwroayx6anc. The lessons were usually conned aloud, and one of the chief duties 
of the schoolmaster was to shout “silence” when the droning grew too noisy. 
For recitations, a system was in vogue by which the master heard the lessons of 
the more advanced pupils, and these the lessons of the inferior scholars. This method, 
by which the better scholars were both pupils and teachers, goes in Greek pedagogy 
under the name of the a2A/Aodidaxruc) pé00d0c. On account of economic reasons it 
continued popular in Greece, improved into the Lancasterian method, even far down 
- into the days of freedom; and even yet traces of it are to be found. 
In the Hellenic schools more order reigned. But here also the HpwrocyéAa, or 
advanced scholars, assisted as teachers of the younger pupils. 
Ancient Greek and Greek literature were the chief studies. No attention whatso- 
ever was paid to the study of the various vernacular dialects of their time. What- 
ever was not good ancient Greek was faulty language. The only grammar studied 
was that of the ancient Attic. 
In the latter half of the eighteenth century Hellenic education among the Greeks 
was in its most flourishing condition since the fall of Constantinopol. Scholars 
began to devise better means of instruction, Pedagogics began to be studied. 
European systems were attracting attention, Koraes, in his Avrocyédior Eroyacuol, 
speaks of the new notions of Pestalozzi and his reforms in the practice of educa- 
tion, and says that although he does not know whether Pestalozzi was improving 
the system of education or not, yet he thinks that the Greek community of Constan- 
tinopol ought to send two young men to Europe for the purpose of studying the Pes- 
talozzian system and of introducing it into the East if they find it good. (See Pan- 
tazides’s Tadaywyikh, IX-X). 
    THE SCHOOLS AS NURSERIES OF PATRIOTISM. 
The warm though smouldering patriotism which was so instrumental in keeping 
the schools alive, and which was in tutn fostered into intense heat by these same 
schools, is well illustrated by an event which happened one day in the Greek schoo] 
at Bucharest. Georgios Gennadios was teaching, and this event is described in the 
writings of Alexandros Rangabes, who was then present as one of Gennadios’s scholars, 
Among the pupils were also the sons of Alexandros Soutsos, hospodar of Wallachia,
-P-A-G-E-371
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 291 
Gennadios was interpreting Isokrates’s celebrated Panegyric. The teacher read to 
his students the old sophist’s description of the glory and splendor of ancient Athens. 
Becoming filled with eestatic fire, he told the students to bar the doors. Then, shut 
in from all contact with the Turkish world outside, he made a burning comparison 
between the greatness of the past and the fallen condition of the present. Tears 
streamed down from his eyes, and every young Hellene present wept and cheered. A 
few months later many of them followed Gennadios to the war as members of the 
Sacred Band, 
Thus it was thatthe schools which the dull oppressors allowed to exist, if properly 
bribed, became each and every one of them a radiating point whence the hope of 
freedom glinted out. Indeed, it was through literature and through the schools and 
through the church that the flame at last burst out. The young palikars were fired 
by the hymns of such as Rhigas, while the more enlightened were whetted into deter- 
mination by the writings of such as Koraes and the teachings of Gennadios. The 
drama, as a literary and artistic expression of patriotism that could directly affect 
the people, could not have opportunity to produce its effect. It was too open to 
suppression. But yet in 1818 the Timoleon of Zampelios was represented at Bucha- 
rest, and assisted in awakening hopes. 
THE PHILO-MUSE SOCIETY. 
('H Sid6povaos ‘Eratpeca.) 
  The Philo-Muse Society, or Society of Art Lovers, deserves at least a passing 
notice. 
In 1812 three men, then living in Athens, set about forming a society for the pro- 
tection of the antiquities of Greece, the founding of a museum, the establishing 
of a library, and the founding of schools. These three men were Ioannes Marmaro- 
toures, Petros Rebelakes, and Alexandros Chomatianos. The constitution of the 
society is published in Konstantinides’s History of Athens. (‘Ioropia rév’ AGnvav ind 
Teopyiov Kovorarrividov. Abf#vyct, 1876, pp. 557 ff.) 
The plan met with favor among the foreigners resident in Athens, a as well as with 
the more prominent Athenians. Accordingly in 1814 the society came into existence 
with Ioannes Kapodistrias, later governor of Greece, as its president. Kapodistrias 
was at that time in the service and high friendship of Alexander of Russia; and 
through Kapodistrias’s influence the Emperor of Russia, the Crown Prince of Bava- 
ria, the Crown Prince of Wurtemburg, and others of high rank, became members. 
But the war broke out and put an end to the good intentions of these Hellenes 
and Philhellenes before they could put their intentions into practice. 
FIRST GREEK BOOKS PUBLISHED. 
One of the first books published after the inventing of printing was the grammar 
of Konstantinos Laskaris. It came from the press in the year 1476 in Milan. This 
grammar remained for a long time the only one in common use. Only after the 
appearance of Asopios’s grammar, and the translations of those of Buttmann and 
Tiersch, was the grammar of Laskaris finally laid aside. 
The first Greek poem ever printed was a paraphrase of the Iliad by a Greek of 
Zakynthos named Loukanos, The paraphrase appeared in print in the year 1526. 
It is a tasteless and unscholarly production. The book is illustrated with woodcuts. 
Achilles is represented as a medieval count, and the priest, Chryses is decked out in 
the cowl and cassock of a western monk, 
Within the Turkish Empire it was not easy to begin to print. Accordingly these 
books mentioned, and nearly all of the other first Greek books printed, were pub- 
lished in Europe. 
The Patriarch Kyrillos Loukaris, otherwise well known as a man of innovations, 
had a printing establishment set up in Constantinopol under the management of 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Nikodemos Metaxas, of Kephalenia. But a pamphlet was printed from it attacking 
some doctrines of the Moslem religion. The surest way to prevent a repetition of, 
the offense was to demolish the establishment. This the Turks did. 
LITERARY CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. 
To properly understand the condition of higher education in any nation one should 
include allof the literature and all of the other media through which higher aspira- 
tions and higher success are indicated. But the literature of the period we are now 
concerned with is not yet accessible to the ordinary scholar. Eminent men like 
Konstantinos Sathos, Emile Le Grand, and others are opening out this new field to 
us. The Greek people during these days were not a nation of readers. The books 
read by the higher classes were chiefly theological, philosophical, and historical 
treatises. And the writers produced mostly books of these kinds. ‘The commoner 
people read even less, of course. Still a book was with them a sacred possession. 
_ Such books as they had were mostly in manuscript. Printed books were scarce. It 
is interesting to note in the epistolary correspondence between Greeks sojourning in 
Europe and their friends at home that their friends are continually asking for books 
from Europe. Books most read by the common people were, the books of the church 
service; the Salvation of Sinners, AvaptoAdv Swrnpia; Bertoldi’s Stories, Ioropia rob 
Mrepré2d1; the Xpovoypdgoc; the writings of Damaskenos; the Erotokritos, and the 
history of Alexander the Great, 7 gvA.Adda roi Meyddov AAetdvdpov. These books could 
be found ready for sale in the ordinary shops where the ordinary necessaries of life, 
food, clothing, implements, etc., were for sale. They could be also copied to order 
by some scholar, or in some monastery. 
The man who knew how to read and write was proud of his acquirements. He 
often carried in his belt ink, pen, and paper as insignia of his attainments. Also 
the child of the family that was picked out by its parents. to become the scholar 
was an object of pride to parents and relatives. It was not an uncommon sight to 
see the little “ypauyariouévog” reading to his parents and brothers and sisters the 
wonderful stories of his gvAAdda. 
Illiteracy was more prevalent among the women than among the men. The fact 
that learning led chiefly to church preferments, and that learning was, after all, a 
masculine affair, prevented the establishment of schools for girls. Whatever of let- 
ters a girl learned she got from her own home or from some nunnery. Nunneries 
were quite numerous, and in them letters were not neglected. Parents often placed 
their daughters in these convents during their girlhood. 
CONDITION OF EDUCATION FROM THE CLOSE OF THE WAR OF LIBERATION DOWN 
TO THE PRESENT TIME. 
THE IONIAN ACADEMY.! 
  The Ionian Islands lie along the western shore of Greece. They passed out of 
Turkish into French control in 1797. The French retained possession of them for 
two years. From 1799 to 1815 they were under Russian suzerainty. Then they 
became an English possession, and remained such until 1864, when they were 
allowed to take their proper place and become a portion of the Greek Kingdom. 
The successive owners of these islands all interested themselves in the matter of

public instruction. The French, in 1797, immediately took steps toward organizing 
a regular system of schools. They established elementary schools throughout the 
islands, and in the capital, Kerkyra, they founded a military school, a library, and 
a printing house. 
The Russians, in their turn, patronized education. Under the Russians the islands 
were practically independent. The sovereign government was represented by a 
plenipotentiary. From this period we have two medals struck in Kerkyra in the 
year 1806 showing the zeal of the plenipotentiary and of the local government for 
the cause of education. These medals were intended as rewards to be given to 
diligent students. One was the gift of the senate of the Heptanesian state and 
the other the gift of the Plenipotentiary Mocenigo. 
In the year 1808 an academy was founded at Kerkyra under great hopes and great 
enthusiasm. In the pompous announcement proclaiming the creation of the academy 
the modern methods of dating were discarded, and the year 1808-1809 indicated as 
the Six hundred and forty-seventh Olympiad. 
This academy, though not destined to a long life, yet did some good work, and 
desired to do still better. In the Adycoe ‘Epyge of 1812 (pp. 193, 194) is published a set 
of questions which the academy sent out ‘‘to travelers and educated men, and espe- 
cially to wise and educated Greeks.” The questions are: 
(1.) What and how many schools, libraries, and other such institutions intended 
for the education of the people have been established in the different parts of Greece 
since the fall of Constantinopol down to our own times? 
(2.) What schools or kindred institutions have the Greeks established outside of 
Greece for the schooling and educating of their countrymen? 
(3.) Are the printing establishments of Moschopolis, Jassy, and Bucharest the 
only ones in Greece? Is it true that there existed a printing establishment in Pha- 
nari of Constantinopol? How long did that printing establishment exist which 
was in the Patriarchate at Constantinopol during the war between France and 
Turkey? 
(4.) Information is asked for concerning the life and the writings of such educated 
Greeks as flourished since the fall of Constantinopol. (See preface to Sathas’s 
NeoeAdqvin)) bchodoyia.) 
In 1815 the English came into possession of the Seven Isles. England governed 
through a commissioner, or harmost. Of these harmosts, Thomas Maitland wasone. 
He took special interest in the good progress of the islands. He set about estab- 
lishing a new academy or college. He caused Count Guilford to be appointed rector. 
The new academy was formally established in 1828 at Kerkyra. (See ‘Hédoude for 
September 7, 1886.) 
Guilford was not only a Philhellene, but was also generous and good and scholarly. 
His motto was, La vertu est la seule noblesse, Knowing the lack of wealth that 
then, as always, afflicted Greece, 777 EAAdd: mevia obvtpogog acei, he himself generously 
bore all the expenses of such young Greeks as would otherwise be unable to pursue 
their studies at the academy. He remained at the head of the academy until June 
of 1827. He died in October of the same year. 
In the library of the building in which the academy was located is a bust of Guil- 
ford in marble of Carrara, the work of a native sculptor, Pavlos Prosalentes. It was 
made at the wish of the students, who thus desired to show their feelings of venera- 
tion toward their director. It was set up in 1826, while Guilford was still presi- 
dent. Another bust of this generous educator, the work of the sculptor Kalosgeros, 
has its place now in Athens among those of prominent men of modern Greece. 
The students as well as the professors of the Ionian Academy, following the Eng- 
lish custom, wore cap and gown. 
This academy, useful as it was, became superfluous with the growth and equip- 
ment of the new university at Athens, Accordingly, it was finally converted into a 
gymnasion, The excellent library of the academy is still in the gymnasion,

Greeks by the Ionian Academy, it will not be amiss to reproduce here a translation 
of one ofits programmes. From this we can form a correct notion of the work done 
in that school. This programme is published in the original Greek in the Bulletin 
of the Historical and Ethnological Society (AeAriov rij¢ ‘loropicpe nat ’EOvodoyinije

  EDUCATION IN GREECE. 295 
FORMATION AND GROWTH OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN GREECE,! 
Inter arma silent Muse. During the seven years’ war for freedom the Greeks 
naturally could take but little care of education. We are astonished, however, to 
find them laying plans for an organized system of education, and to hear assemblies 
composed of klephtic warriors deliberating on where the schools should be estab- 
lished, and to find individuals, old men, priests, and others who were not fit for war, 
establishing little schools here and there. Yea, within the very Parthenon itself 
a school was opened in the year 1824 for little tots of girls whose fathers were fight- 
ing the war of freedom. We love the Parthenon for its beauty; but it is more 
worthy of being loved on account of having been a shelter to education than 
because of being the Partbenon. (See Td Map9evaywysiov rod 1824 év’ADAvarg in the 
'E6doudc for October 24, 1887.) 
But not all of these old heroes looked upon education as the best means of insur- 
ing their freedom forever. Old Kolokotrones said on a certain important occasion 
that ‘books could not be used for better purposes than for gun wads.” We forgive 
him, because Kolokotrones’s gunshots were intended to protect home and altar. 
As early as the second year of the war the leaders made positive declarations in 
fayor of education. In the Assembly at Astros, in the spring of 1823, they voted 
that ‘‘the education of the youth of the country be reduced to a regular system, 
and that the Government take steps to have the reciprocal method of teaching intro- 
duced throughout the country. 
It is true that these declarations were not then put into practical execution, 
They show not what the Greeks of that time could do, but rather what they would 
do if they had the means. The Government was powerless to put its aspirations 
into execution. The war absorbed most of their active measures and resources. 
Some of the Philhellenes that went to Greece at that time were as anxious as the 
Greeks themselves for the immediate systematizing of education. Leicester Stanhope, 
who arrivedin Missolonghi in 1823, forthwith began to agitate the matter of education. 
In this he was at variance with his compatriot, Byron, who also was at Missolonghi 
atthe same time. Byron wished that Greece first acquire a certain amount of in- 
dependent existence by means of arms, and that she then turn to education. Stan- 
hope, however, immediately began to put his philosophical plans into execution, 
(See Greeco in 1823 and 1824, being a series of letters and other documents on the 
Greek revolution by the Hon. Leicester Stanhope. Philadelphia, 1825.) He was a 
disciple of Jeremy Bentham. He established a new!

in Greek and Italian, and edited by Dr. Meyer, a Swiss Philhellene. The motto of 
the paper was Bentham’s saying, ‘The greatest good of the greatest number.” Not 
only did Stanhope establish this paper and endeavor to establish others in other 
parts of the country, but he also endeavored to establish schools. These he wished 
to be conducted on the Lancasterian, or reciprocal plan. But neither Hellenes nor 
Philhellenes succeeded in establishing a school system at that early date. 
That scholarly youths of the best type were not scarce among the Greeks at the 
beginning of the war is shown by the fact of the formation of the Sacred Band, the 
‘Iepdc Adyoc, made up of five hundred students. They wore a uniform of black, and 
on their standard was the old Spartan motto } trav 7 ’xitdv. These five hundred brave 
boys rallied to the seeret call of Prince Alexander Ypsilantis and the 4:Ac«? ‘Eraipia. 
Some of them were in Gennadios’s school at Bucharest. Gennadios was in the midst 
of his lecture when a messenger rushed into the room with the news that Ypsilantis 
had passed the Pruth. He threw his books into the fire of the open grate, and rushed 
off, followed by his students, to join the prince. The young soldiers of the Sacred 
Band were true to their Spartan motto, and on the 19th of June, 1821, four hun- 
dred of them lay as a first holocaust to liberty, dead in their blood on the hill slope 
of Dragachan.! 
In the year 1824 the determination to establish asystem of education became mani- 
fest again. A committee of five, appointed for the purpose, submitted to the Gov- 
ernment a plan which provided for the establishment of three sets of schools. The 
first and lowest set was to comprise elementary and popular education; the second 
consisted of lyceums, and the third was to contain at least a universi The com- 
mittee then went on to state that since it was impossible to put the entire system 
into operation at that time, the Government should give most of its attention to 
that part which was the most important, primary education, and that in the primary 
schools the reciprocal system should be employed because of its inexpensiveness; 
and that a model or central school should be at once established at Argos. The 
school at Argos was established, with Gennadios as director. But the vicissitudes 
of war soon interfered, and the school was closed. 
After a small quotum of peace came to Greece, and a formal government had been 
established under Kapodistrias, the school question came up again. Kapodistrias 
was not at all an advocate of higher education, but favored primary and interme- 
diate. Yet those that impatiently longed for the establishing of an organized sys- 
tem of education had placed high hopes in Kapodistrias. He had been a member 
of the Philo-Muse Society. He was on intimate terms with many educators of 
Europe. Among his acquaintances was the celebrated Fellenberg, whose didactic 
methods Kapodistrias contemplated introducing into Greece, and with this end in 
view he carried on negotiations in Munich, which resulted in Bader’s coming to 
Greece to undertake the organization of the school system and to introduce Fellen- 
berg’s methods. The project, however, did not bear much fruit, and the advocates 
of learning soon discovered that they would have to push Kapodistrias in this matter 
instead of being led by him. 
So the people at large did not wait for the Government to act. In the year 1828 
from the 1st of February to the 1st of May, i. e., within the short space of three 
months, twenty-two reciprocal schools were established in the towns on the islands 
of the Aigean, and with no expense whatsoever to the General Government, but 
solely at the cost of the communities themselves. 
From this time on schools multiplied rapidly. According to a report published in 
the Spectateur de l’Orient for August 22, 1854, 15,000 children were attending school 
in the year 1829. To appreciate the significance of these figures we must note that 
the population of Greece then was, according to the same report, only 693,000. 
This gives 46 pupils for every 1,000 inhabitants. And this was in the year just after 
the close of the war.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. nue 
In 1830 Kokkones, the minister of education, published a report under date of 
December 30, stating that the number of primary and Hellenic schools then in opera- 
tion was, in the Peloponnesos 55, in North Greece (reped ‘E22dc) 6, and in the islands 
48. These schools were attended by 9,737 pupils. (See Bartholdi-Blachos, u, p. 85.) 
Kapodistrias’s indifference or rather dislike toward institutions of higher learning 
was partly due to the fact that he thought the universities of Europe to be hotbeds 
of revolution. And having been trained in the court of Russia he could have but 
little sympathy for institutions that would in any way foster too much liberty. 
His friend and most acceptable adviser in this matter, Alexander Stourtza, held the 
same views. In the year 1818 Stourtza had published in French a memoir on the 
present condition of Germany, in which he vigorously attacked the German universi- 
ties as being seminaries of revolutionary ideas, and advocated the placing of all 
higher education in the hands of the clergy. Stourtza and Kapodistrias had many 
a cosy talk over the uselessness and harmfulness of universities. (For a good pane- 
gyrical account of Stourtza’s life, see ’AAéEardpo¢ 6 Srobprlac. broypadindy ayediacpa id 
Kovoravrivon rob & Oixovduwr. ?Ahrnot, 1855.) 
Kapodistrias had the ill fortune to be disliked not only by many of the educators, 
but also by the students of the only important gymnasion, that of Aigina, which 
Kapodistrias allowed to be founded. The students of this central gymnasion openly 
rebelled in 1831, directly indeed against Mystoxydes and the method of teaching and 
discipline employed in the school, but indirectly against Kapodistrias himself. How 
great their antipathy toward him was showed itself on the occasion of his violent 
death a few months later. They gathered together and sang the song commemora- 
tive of the assassination of the Athenian tyrant by Harmodios and Aristogeiton, 
which the youth of the old Republic of Athens used to sing in classic days: 
‘By wiprou KAadi 7 Eipos bopnow.” 
  Mystoxides, mentioned above, was earnest and active in the cause of education. 
He was one of Kapodistrias’s nearest friends. The Government established a library, 
an archeological museum, and a museum of mineralogy. Over all of these Mysto- 
xides was placed as president. 
During the vice-regency which governed while the young King Otho was in his. 
minority the affairs of education, as all the other important public affairs, were 
managed by the Bavarian officeholders who had followed Otho to Greece. In order 
to insure the appointment of fit teachers two committees were appointed, one to sit 
at Nayplion and the other in Aigina, to examine all candidates for the position of 
teacher in a gymnasium or other public school. But not a single person presented 
himself before these committees. This lack of applicants was chiefly due to the 
fact that from the very beginning a strong feeling of dislike to be examined by 
foreigners, and subservient in all details to foreigners, began to show itself. The 
unwieldy inadaptability of the German examiners and professors tended to heighten 
this dislike. The unhappy result was the retirement of some of the Germans after 
a short period of troublous but highly beneficial work in the newly established 
school system. 
This brings us to a point where we can treat of the different kinds of schools 
separately. 
DEMOTIC SCHOOLS.! 
(Anuorixa Zxodera.) 
In January, 1829, Kapodistrias appointed a committee on elementary education, 
and to this committee he intrusted the duty of organizing and establishing a system 
of primary schools. This committee (7 é? r7¢ Iporadetiac ’Exctporg) gave the demotic

  schools the character which they still retain. Kapodistrias himself took great inter- 
est in these lower schools. Often he visited them, and spent hours in examining the 
little fustanelled hopefuls in the alphabet, syllabification, ete. (See Td Tayeiov riH¢ 
Anuoriijc Matdetag in the ‘Eédoude for October 26, 1886.) 
In 1834 laws were enacted prescribing in detail how demotic schools are to be 
established and conducted. They were modeled chiefly after elementary French 
schools, and are therefore an exception in the system, for all the other schools are 
after German models. 
In the demotic schools the course extends over a period of four years. The studies 
are the same for boys and for girls. When the number of children that should 
attend a demotic school is greater than 75, then two teachers are appointed, a man 
for the boys and a woman for the girls. But when the total number is less than 7, 
there is then but one teacher, a man, who teaches both boys and girls. When boys 
and girls have different teachers, then the two schools are usually not under the 
same roof but in different buildings, and at times in different parts of the town. 
Children are supposed to begin in the demotic schools at the age of 6 and to attend 
till the age of 10 completed. 
The entire country is quite well supplied with demotic schools. It is almost 
impossible to find a village of any size which has not at least one demotic school 
where both boys and girls attend. Melingo, in his Griechenland in Unseren Tagen 
(Wien, 1893), gives the number of these schools as being about 1,600. This makes 
one school for about 1,400 inhabitants, a proportion which, as Melingo remarks, 
compares favorably with the proportion of elementary schools in the Austro-Hun- 
garian Empire. It is easy to understand that in out of the way places these schools 
are miserably kept. For example of such a school see ‘Eédoud¢ for June 2, 1890, in 
the article Zyodeiov cai didackadeiov. The school there described was most carelessly 
kept, filthy and unventilated. 
Attendance at the demotic schools is obligatory by law. No parents or guardians 
are legally excused from giving the children under their charge this elementary 
education. However, instead of sending their children to the public schools, they 
may send them to private schools of the same standing. This law making primary 
education compulsory dates back to the year 1834. Since education is compulsory 
it naturally follows that it is imparted free of cost. It is delightful to remember 
that this decree for free elementary instruction to all dates back to a decree of the 
first constitution of Epidavros, while Greece was merely a desert through the devas- 
tations of war. 
The little children make a pleasing impression on the stranger. They are bright 
and diligent. They learn with greatest ease. They are obedient and respectful. 
They are examined twice a year, in February and during the first two weeks of 
July. However, when in country places the gathering of the raisins or the har- 
vesting of grain interferes with the attendance of the children at school, then the 
teacher may transfer the examinations to a later time, but must inform the minister 
of education concerning the change. These examinations are quite formal affairs, 
especially the July ones. A committee of five is appointed by the local representa- 
tive of the Government. The committee always includes the scholarch of the Hel- 
lenic school or, at least a teacher from the Hellenic school, and one of the most learned 
priests of the locality. (For an accurate and delightful description of examinations 
in a village school see Demetrios Bikelas’s Td Syodciov tov yopiov in his Acarégece wat 
Avauvioec, pp. 92-99.) At the close of these July examinations the summer holidays 
begin. But for the demotic schools the vacation lasts only twenty days. 
The teachers in the demotic schools, the djuodwWécxado, are appointed directly by 
the minister of education. Most appointments depend on the political worth of the 
friends of the candidate. The appointments are made annually. The community 
to which a teacher is to be sent has little or no direct control over the appointment. 
Still the local politicians keep to their local teachers as arule. Ina word, although 
a teacher never knows where he will be next year, yet many of them remain in the

same school for years. Professor Manatt, of Brown University, (see Behind Hymet- 
tus, by J. Irving Manatt, in the Atlantic Monthly for May, 1894) met a fine specimen 
of teacher in Spata of Attica, who had taught there for twenty-five years. 
METHOD OF INSTRUCTION, 
The details of the method of instruction in these schools are contained in the 
famous ‘Odyyéc, or Teacher’s Guide, published for the first time in Agina in 1830, 
and since then repeatedly republished with modifications. It was a translation 
from the French, and bore the title "Eyyerpidiov did ra GAAnRodWaKTiKd cyoreia, 7 ddnydc

I. P. Koxxovy. 
The method prescribed in this guide is the reciprocal or Lancasterian. It owes 
this second name to one of its inventors, Joseph Lancaster, of England (1778-1838). 
It has for its main feature the fact that the older pupils act as instructors for the 
younger. The Greeks took kindly to the system on account of its inexpensiveness. 
The first Greek to be attracted to the system in its Western form was G. Kleopoulos, 
who became acquainted with it while studying pedagogics in Switzerland. In 1820 
he published a description of the system, recommending it to his countrymen. His 
brochure, “ExYeow wept tig "AAAnAodWaxtiKje MeQddov, appeared at Jassy in 1820. The 
method was at once introduced into the Greek schools of Jassy and Bucharest. 
(See Rangabe und Sanders Geschichte de Neugriechischen Litteratur, p. 25.) 
About the same time Ath. Polites introduced it into the Ionian Islands, and 
Christophoros Perraebos established a school at Doli in the Peloponnesos, 
This reciprocal method continues in use even yet in country schools; but the 
system is no longer in favor, and the teachers have found it best to assume to them- 
selves all the obligations of directly imparting instruction to all their pupils, both 
beginners and more advanced. 
SCHOOL IN THE OPEN AIR. 
In many places the school buildings are inexcusably ill-looking. Often the school 
consists of a single small room, and sometimes it contains no teaching apparatus 
whatsoever. Few communities own school buildings, and it is not always the most 
commodious and pleasant quarters that the committee rents. 
On this account, as well as on account of the love which the Greek-has for the 
open air when the weather is fine, teachers in the smaller towns often hold school 
out of doors, under some large tree or in some other shady place. Mr. D. Kaprales, 
in his book ’Avd ra "Op (p. 74), describes such a school in a small village not far from 
Patras. ‘On account of the excessive heat, the village schoolmaster holds session 
under the shade of.a plane tree. Thirty little lads, each with asack full of booklets 
at his side, sit on long benches. They con in silence their lessons, accompanied by 
the sweet susurrus of themountain breeze. * * * Some of them, as punishment 
for having been at fault the day before, kneel while listening to the master’s teach- 
ing. While others failing in their recitations are sonndly switched, the master 
accompanying his action with the adago ‘the rod is a gift of God,’ as though it were 
an incantation.” 
Sometimes the number of pupils in the small schoolrooms is much too large for 
the room, and accordingly it is certainly a relief both to teacher and to pupils to 
escape into the open air. 
As an illustration of how many pupilsare in some country schools, a school for the 
little girls in the village of Limne in Eubea may be taken as an instance. Mr. G. 
Paraskevopoulos visited it in 1893, and mentions it in his Tageid: ava tiv "ERAdda, He 
found that one woman teacher had 110 children under her charge. Had not the 
tidiness and cleanliness of the old schoolroom as well as the children immediately

impressed him, he would have expected to find but poor results. As it was, how- 
ever, he was astonished at how the little girls could read. For lack of benches many 
of them had to sit on the floor. 
The following table shows the matter taught in the demotic schools, and the num- 
ber of hours per week devoted to each study, for each of the four years. (See

EXPENSE OF SCHOOL BOOKS. 
In all schools the pupils furnish their own books. These are not expensive. They 
are usually unbound, and cost from a few pennies to about 50 cents each. Yetmany 
a parent finds it difficult to provide them. Accordingly in some places books are 
furnished free by some plan or other. Thus in the island of Pholegandros, where 
the people, although very simple, take a high interest in their schools—and they 
have both a demotic and a Hellenic—books are supplied to the children at the 
expense of the Pholegandrian Brotherhood, a society existing in Constantinopol and 
made up of Pholegandrians temporarily living in that city for the sake of employ- 
ment. The sole object of the society almost is to foster education. Think of it. 
And all of its members are day laborers. They contribute to the maintaining and 
improving of the schools in their island home, from which they are separated for a 
time by self-imposed exile, keep the school buildings in repair, supply maps, teach- 
ing apparatus, and books, etc. (See boAéyavdpoc, ind Zagerpiov Tabada in the AeAr. 
tig ‘lot. «. "EOv. ‘Eraip. Vol. u, pp. 503-504.) 
PRAYERS IN SCHOOL. 
Each half-day’s work in school begins and ends with prayer. The pupils allstand 
up and make the sign of the Cross three times. Then the teacher or one of the older 
pupils pronounces the prayers, which are always the same, namely, in the morning 
the Baoihed Odpdvie and Kipie 7d ravdyidv cov Tvevua, before the noon recess, the Our 
Father, the rv racav éArida cov, 6} ebyov, and sometimes a hymn, In the afternoon

  A, B, C SCHOOLS. 
(Tpapparocxoreza.) 
In small hamlets where it is impossible to support a demotic school, and yet the 
place is too remote for the children to attend the nearest demotic school, it is per- 
mitted to establish a ypayuatocyodeiov or A,B,C school. The teacher in a grammato- 
scholeion need have no special preparation for teaching. It is sufficient that he be

of good moral standing, and know the elements of reading, writing, catechism, and 
arithmetic. He receives a small salary from the revenues of the Deme. He is sub- 
ject to the demodidaskalos of the demotic school in whose territory his grammato- 
scholeion lies. His pupils are supposed to be from 5 to 8 years old. After reach- 
ing the age of 8, they are supposed to bo able to attend the regular demotic school, 
even though it be somewhat distant. (See Oecpordyiov, pp. 393-400.) 
In these A, B, C schools the teacher is often the local priest. In the demotic 
schools also the teacher is often the parish priest.     EDUCATION IN GREECE.

            After learning what is taught in the demotic schools, such boys as wish to study 
still longer enter a Hellenic school. The Hellenic schools are so called because in 
them the study of the Greek language begins, the ‘EA27vcx7 yAdooa. The course of 
studies covers a period of four years. With the addition of ancient Greek during 
the entire four years, and a five months’ course in Latin grammar duriug the latter 
half of the last year, the matter taught is a direct continuance of what is taught 
in the last two years of the course in the demotic schools. In the reading and 
language classes, usual text books are the fables of Hsopos, the Anabasis of Xeno- 
phon, the dialogues of the dead of Loukianos, and during the last of the three years 
the orations of Lysias and of Isokrates. In grammar the declensions, conjugations, 
etc., are reviewed, and syntax is begun. Translations are made from ancient Greek 
into the modern katharevousa, and from the katharevousa into the ancient Attic. 
Ancient and modern history is studied. In the natural sciences the elements of 
geometry, physics, and zoology are studied. 
There are now about 180 Hellenic schools in the Kingdom. There is at least one 
in each province—and in Greece the provinces are not large. 
In order to be a candidate for the position of teacher in a Hellenic school one must 
have passed the master’s examinations in the university, or else possess a diploma 
from a teachers’ school. 
Each Hellenic school is controlled by a staff of two or more teachers. The head 
teacher is called the scholarch, oyoidpync. The number of teachers depends on the 
number of pupils. 
Written examinations are held in January, and oral examinations for promotion 
in June. 
Such scholars as succeed in the final examinations of the fourth year may then 
enter a gymnasion, if they so desire. 
TEACHERS’ SCHOOLS. 
(Atéackadeta.) 
From the very first it was evident that there was no possibility of having good 
schools without having teachers specially trained in their profession. And since it 
could not be expected that doctors of the university, trained in the philological or 
other seminaries there, would usually become teachers in the lower schools, it became 
necessary to establish a school for the proper training of teachers for these schools. 
The school was opened with the German Philhelleno, Dr. Kork of Bremen, as the 
first director. Dr. Kork began the work with all zeal. He took as his models the 
teachers’ schools of his own country. Unfortunately, Dr. Kork soon fell into con- 
tentions with some of the other professors in the didaskaleion, especially with Pro- 
fessor Apostolides, and, being in ill health besides, he withdrew from the school. 
He was succeeded in October of 1835 by Kokkones. 
In the Secporsycov (111, p. 66 f.) is a schedule of the matter to be taught in the 
didaskaleion. 
In the year 1864 the teachers’ school was discontinued by Royal decree. It was 
thought that teachers could be selected from university students and from those
-P-A-G-E-382
302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
that had studied in the gymnasia, and an examining committeo was appointed 
before which candidates for these positions of teachers might appear. 
But in 1876 it was deemed expedient to re-establish the teachers’ school. It began 
to operate September 24 of that year. 
THE GYMNASIA, 
  (Ta Tupvdora.) 
The first gymnasion in Greece was the “Central School,” the Kevrpixdy Syoreiov, 
founded in A gina on the 13th of November, 1829, It was intended to be a model for 
all other gymnasia throughout the kingdom. ‘The first years of the school, however, 
were not entirely successful. The discipline was monastically rigid. The teachers 
were under governmental surveillance. The freedom which successful teaching 
demands was wanting. These defects, however, passed away with Kapodistrias. 
As with the Hellenic schools, so also with the gymnasia, their founders and organ- 
izers aimed at introducing a faithful copy of the German schools. The gymnasia 
were modeled especially after the gymnasia of Bavaria. 
In 1837, when the university was opened, there were four gymnasia successfully 
operating. The number rapidly grew, and at present there is a gymnasion in every 
town of sufficient size to justify the Government in establishing it. In the larger 
cities, such as Athens, Patras, etc., there are more than one, according to the popu 
lation. 
Some gymnasia do not offer the complete course of four years, the two upper 
classes being wanting. These are called gymnasia of the second class. Those in 
which the full course is given are gymnasia of the first class. 
Each gymnasion is managed by its own faculty. At the head of the faculty is the 
gymnasiarch, youzvacrépyyc. The gymnasiarch is himself one of the teaching body 
of the gymnasion. However, he has the right and duty of overseeing the work of 
the other professors and of directing it in some measure. 
The details in the teaching of the gymnasia are provided for by regulations of the 
department of education. There exists a general schedule or programme of studies 
which is to serve as a model for the yearly programmes of the individual schools. 
The department of education, from time to time as occasions call for such, publishes 
explanations or interpretations of such parts of the general programme as seem to 
need such additional illustration, A general programme was officially published as 
early as 1855. In 1867 a new programme was made and the old one annulled. Again, 
in 1884, a new programme was issued in June of that year. The programme of 1884 
isstillin force. These programmes determine the studies to be taughtin the Hellenic 
schools as well as inthe gymnasia, Although the gymnasia all follow the same gen- 
eral programme, and are from a material point of view provided for in about the 
same way, yet alldo not produce equally good results. Thisis due to the accidental 
efficiency or inefficiency of the several teachers that make up the corps of instruc- 
tion, to the quality and previous training of the students, their occupation, mode of 
life, ete. 
The gymnasia are generally supported by the State; but in places where the popu- 
lation is not sufficiently large to justify the State in expending money for their sup- 
port, the people of the community sometimes support one for themselves, paying the 
expenses in some ingenious way. For instance, the town of Nesion, in Messenia, not 
being favored by the Government with a gymnasion, its inhabitants were in the year 
1896 supporting one by a voluntary tax, levied and collected by themselves of 1 cen- 
time (Jev7év) on each oke of grapes or figs produced in their fields. (See Paraskevo- 
poulos in his Tageidv.) 
The physical sciences are taught, indeed, but in a very defective way. The gym- 
nasia are classical schools, and the physical sciences are taught, not as having any 
prime importance, but as merely being worth some slight attention. This is, perhaps, 
due to the fact that the really great importance of classic education in Greece over- 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 303 
  shadows the high claims that the physical sciences have on modern education. The 
schools lack apparatus. Yet improvement should come, because these branches are 
now being taught by men that have won their doctorate in the physical sciences, and 
are therefore both capable teachers and interested in the progress of their specialty. 
In the gymnasia of Athens, Patras, and other larger towns, the students weara 
special dress or uniform of cadet-like appearance; in the smaller towns, however, 
no such luxury is to be seen. In these small towns many a young aspirant to letters 
still wears the national fustanella. It is a pity that all do not do so. 
In order to seize the advantages of an education the hardy young Greeks, espe- 
cially of the provinces, often endure hardships that would make us shiver. The 
writer once visited four brave lads that were staying in Sparta for the winter in 
order to attend the gymnasion there, as their own native ywpid had none. They had 
rented a small house consisting of one room with the ground for floor. He came in 
upon them as they were at dinner. The only food they had was a pot of maccaroni, 
cooked by themselves. Other than the four young heroes ‘the only bright thing in 
that room was the little stack of books they took bashful pride in showing to him, 
In the gymnasial course the study of philosophy is prominently included. The 
course includes logic, anthropology, psychology, and ethics. But these studies seem 
to be somewhat superficially taught. At least this is the opinion of Mr. I. Argyria- 
des, who, in a report to the ministry of education (“ExOeawe zpd¢ rd Yroupyeiov rig 
Tlaidelag rep) rov év’ADhvare Touvactor kad’ EAAquixév Syorelov, p. 26), vigorously attacks 
the defects in the way in which philosophy is taught, and his complaints are warmly 
supported by Pantazides in his Pedagogies (Madaywyix}, pp. 31, 32.) 
Since Greek is the vernacular language, it naturally holds a most prominent place 
in the curricula of the gymnasia. The young student comes to the gymnasium able 
to read and understand the simpler writings of his classic forefathers, such as the 
Dialogues of the Dead, or the Anabasis, or the more simple dialogues of Platon. 
He has mastered all of the Attic grammar save syntax, and he has spent at least a 
year at that, for he began it in the third year of the hellenikon. He is also able to 
write simple themes in the ancient language, and is able to paraphrase with wonder- 
ful mechanical accuracy from the ancient into the katharevousa. True, he has not 
had the gigantic difficulties to overcome that are sufficient to hinder youths of other 
countries from mastering ancient Greek. For him it is merely the learning of a 
different variety of his own vernacular. The intelligent young Greek is never ata 
loss to understand good Hellenic, although he may be amused by it. However, if in 
one lesson the teacher employs what he thinks to be a specially Attic word or phrase 
he is not surprised if his pupils use it back at him in the next lesson. 
In the gymnasion the student reads not only the more difficult prose authors, such 
as Herodotos and Thukydides, but also the poets. He reads, and, from a grammatical 
standpoint, analyzes into shreds select dramas of Sophokles and Euripides. He reads 
the language of the poets not by quantity, as we say, but by accent—that is, he pro- 
nounces the words as he does when reading prose. He learns to scan also, but neither 
his teacher nor he have any liking for the process. His knowledge of prosody does 
not lead him beyond the ability to scan a dactylic or an iambic line. 
The young boys enter the gymnasion with little preparation in Latin. On account 
of the greater importance of the classic Greek the Latin is liable to be slighted. At 
least to us in the west who regard Latin as equal in importance with Greek, it seems 
that Latin is underrated in the Greek gymnasia, (See Die Stellung des Latein in 
den Héhern Schulen Neugriechenlands, In the Berliner Philologische Wochenschrift, 
1884 S., 31-32.) But after all we are liable to be prejudiced critics on the one side, 
as the Greeks themselves are likely prejudiced on the other side. 
With a six months’ training in Latin in the hellenikon, he comes to the gymnasion 
and takes up the following courses: 
First year: Latin accidents, a Latin reader, Nepos. 
Second year: Syntax, Cesar, 
Third year; Syntax, composition, Livy, Cwesar. 
   
-P-A-G-E-384
    304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Fourth year: Composition, Vergil, Horace, and something in prose; e. g., pro 
Milone or the Agricola of Tacitus. 
Of the modern languages, French is the only one that is obligatory in the gymna- 
sion. Among educators are to be found some that desire to have German placed 
among the obligatory studies, But they have not been strong enough to succeed. 
German, indeed, is taught as an optional course. In some of the larger gymnasia 
English is also taught as an optional study. Although a four years’ course in French 
is provided for, yet it is not seriously studied. Few of the students at the end of 
the four years are able to more than simply read it, and that faultily, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that the Greeks l»arn languages with great ease. 
Mathematics are always taught by specialists. Accordingly, the instruction given 
is good. Yet the course is very weak. In pure mathematics the highest studies are 
algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. 
In the university there is no chair of geography; so it is to be expected that this 
study in the gymnasia is not a success. Being taught by teachers who themselves 
have not studied it, no scientific enthusiasm either on part of teacher or student can 
be expected. Another difficulty in geography comes from the Greek language. The 
modern Greek is poor insounds. Itis not easy to transliterate into Greek the names 
of places, etc., met with in the study of geography. There is ever present the dif- 
ficulty of putting such names as London, Massachusetts, Maryland, into intelligible 
forms with Greek letters. As yet there is no fixed practice, But such names as Rome, 
Switzerland, France, are represented by their ancient forms, Péyy, ‘E26eria, Tardia, 
A few names are translated, as Ta Aevad “Opn, Al ‘Hywpévar Wotureia for ‘the White 
Mountains,” ‘‘the United States.” Other names again are either spelled in Latin 
letters and pronounced as the names are pronounced in their native country, or are 
transferred into Greekish form, as ‘Aju@dén, McA6d«y, for Halifax, Milwaukee. (See 
Tewypagia @vorKy kai Modctix), ixd Mapyapirov I. Afuetoa. év’ AOfvatc.) 
Another drawback in the teaching of geography is the lack of apparatus. Until 
of late even wall maps of Greece itself with the names of the places in Greek were 
not to be found in the schools. Now, however, thanks to the efforts of the Society 
for the Diffusion of Greek Letters (‘Eraipeia mpdc Arddoow trav ‘EAAnvinov Tpappatov) 
and to the generosity of a rich Greek, Mr. Zapheiropoulos, simple geographical 
apparatus is not such a rarity as it was some years ago. The society has taken steps 
to fit out the schools with useful apparatus for different branches, and Mr. Zaphei- 
ropoulus has borne the expense of publishing a number of excellent maps. 
History is taught during all of the four years according to the following schedule: 
First year: Greek history from its beginnings down to the time of Alexander, pre- 
ceded by an introduction, treating of the different peoples of the East with whom 
the early Greeks came into contact. 
Second year: Roman and Byzantine history down to the capture of Constanti- 
nopol by the Franks in 1204. 
Third year: History of the Middle Ages, and modern history down to the treaty 
of Vienna. 
Fourth year: Greek history down to the appointment of Kapodistrias as governor 
of Greece. 
Of the natural sciences several are taught, but the time devoted to each is neces- 
sarily short. Still it is better, perhaps, to give a certain general knowledge of the 
principles of a number of these sciences than to devote all the disposable time to one 
or two exclusively. Whoever wishes to pursue any one of them as a specialty will 
find his opportunity in the university or in the Polytechnic Institute. 
The general programme of 1884 orders a course of natural sciences as follows: 
First year: Zoology, two hours a week. 
Second year: Botany, geology, mineralogy, two hours a week. 
Third year: Experimental physics, two hours a week. 
Fourth year: Chemistry and cosmography, two hours a week.

THE SCHOLASTIC YEAR. 
In the gymnasia the school year begins with the first week of September, and 
continues, with a short break at Christmas and a week at Easter, until the end of 
July. But the entire month of September is consumed in examining new applicants 
for admission, and the entire last month is occupied with the annual and final exam- 
inations. Accordingly there are but nine months of regular instruction, and even 
of these nine months the last one is given over to repetitions, etc., in preparation for 
the examinations, and is therefore almost lost so far as education is concerned. 
There remains then but eight months of real instructive teaching. 
EXAMINATIONS, 
In the gymnasia the following examinations take place: 
In the month of September there are examinations for such new applicants as have 
no regular dimissorial (aroAvrjpiov) or certificate stating that they have finished a 
course in the hellenikon; also examinations for all who having failed at the exami- 
nations for promotion in the preceding July were accorded the privilege of present- 
ing themselves again in September. 
In January written examinations are held in all branches. 
In July the regular annual oral examinations are held in order to discover who are 
worthy of promotion and who are not. No promotions are made in midyear. It is 
wrong to allow promotion to depend, not on the work of the year but on the annual 
examinations; but the Greeks are not the only ones that make this mistake. At the 
end of the year also are held the examinations of those that have finished their gym- 
nasial studies and wish to procure a dimissorial (aroAvrfpvov) or certificate for the 
university. These dimissorial examinations do not cover the matter of four years of 
the gymnasion course, but merely the matter of the last year. 
DISCIPLINE—MODES OF PUNISHMENT. 
What we said of the pupils of the lower schools, that they are diligent and well 
behaved, can also be said of the average student of the gymnasion, though not with 
the same emphasis. 
The punishment with the rod, although a favorite one with the Greek schoolmaster, 
is forbidden by positive orders of the ministry of education, under date of Decem- 
ber 12, 1848. In spite of this law, however, the teachers in the lower schools still 
use the rod, but the teachers in the gymnasia have long since discarded it. 
Expulsion (a7o06024) from the gymnasion is inflicted when milder remedies fail. 
According to the law, sentence of expulsion can be passed on a student only by vote 
of a majority of the professors in the school. This decision of the corps of teachers 
can not be revoked even by the minister of education. 
When a student is found guilty of some greater crime, he may not only be expelled 
from his own gymnasion, but also be punished by ‘‘exclusion,” aroxAevoude, from all 
other gymnasia of the kingdom. This punishment can be inflicted only by the 
cooperation of the professors and the local representative of the civil government, 
The student thus punished can appeal to the minister of education against the 
sentence. 
SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
The Greeks have not been so prompt in caring for the intellectual training of their 
daughters as for that of their sons; yet they have never looked on education as unbe- 
coming or even useless toa woman. We have already seen that in the year 1824, 
almost immediately after the battles of Marathon and Kalamos, which brought the 
first fresh breath of freedom to the Athenians, a school for girls was opened in the 
Parthenon. 
ED 97——20
-P-A-G-E-386
306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Years passed, however, before the Greeks could provide any public system of edu- 
cation for girls higher than what they could learn in the demotic schools. 
The first school in which girls could receive more than the mere elements of learn- 
ing was established in Athens by two Americans, Dr. and Mrs. Hill. 
But the Arsakeion (Td Apodxevov), which is now perhaps the best school for young 
ladies, can also boast of quite an early origin. It was founded in July, 1836. It 
takes its name from its greatest benefactor, Apostolos Arsakes. This same munificent 
patriot has also founded similar schools elsewhere. 
The Arsakeion in Athens, and a number of similar young ladies’ schools, xap9eva- 
yoyeia, in other cities of Greece, were the result of the endeavors of a number of men, 
who associated themselves together under the name of the Society of the Promoters 
of Education, d:Aexnadevtixy ‘Eraipeia. 
These determined men began without means. They sent out appeals to various 
rich Greeks, and Arsakes responded. 
The course of studies in the Arsakeion is on a par with that of the gymnasia for 
boys,! and graduates of this school now have the privilege of becoming university 
students, 
The Arsakeion does good especially by preparing teachers for the elementary 
schools for girls. 
; PRIVATE SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
  Such parents as can afford it have a strong inclination to send their children not 
to the public schools, but to schools in which the pupils receive more parental care 
than can be given to them in the public institutions. There are accordingly many 
such private schools of all grades, whether for boys or for girls, throughout all of 
Greece. As a sample of a parthenagogeion, or young ladies’ school under private 
management, we take one in Athens under the direction of Miss Aspasia Blasiou 
Skordele. (See Kavoviopde rod EAAgvixod WapPevaywyelov Logiacg SiworobAov kal Aowactag 
BA. TaopdéAy év ’AGHvasc, 1891.) 
This educated and refined lady takes her love of the art and practice of teaching 
from her father, Blasios Skordeles, who has made a study of education all his life, 
is most thoroughly acquainted with the condition of primary and middle education 
in Greece, and has written valuable works for the use of teachers and scholars. 
Lady Skordele studied in the Arsakeion. Her teacher in pedagogics there was 
her own very competent father. 
Ten years ago this academy was founded. It contains three separate departments, 
a kindergarten, a demotic school, and a high school, which includes the classes of a 
Hellenic school and the two lower classes of a gymnasion. There is also an extra 
course of two years more for such as are preparing themselves for teaching. 
Lady Skordele does not object to the principle of women pursuing higher studies 
and devoting themselves to special sciences, but yet thinks that Greece has at pres- 
ent more need of competent housekeepers and intelligent wives and mothers than 
of scientific women. For this reason this school does not profess to prepare young 
ladies for the university. 
The kindergarten is intended for children of from 4 to 6 years of age. The system 
followed is the Froebelian. 
The course given in the demotic school extends over the regular four years. The 
matter taught during this period is as follows: 
Religion, portions of the Old and New Testament; modern Greek language; read- 
ing, grammar, declamation; learning by memory of select pieces in prose and verse; 
composition; arithmetic, applied to problems taken from such experience as chil- 
dren haye; leading events in national history, taught mostly by biographers; 
description of Greece, together with general geography and map drawing; simple 
lessons in the natural sciences and in art; French, compulsory; drawing, caligraphy, 
hand work, vocal music, gymnastics.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. 30T 
The course in the high school extends over six years. It embraces catechism, 
explanation of the ceremonies of the church, principal events in church history; 
ancient Greek, with grammar, including syntax, composition in modern Greek; 
Greek history, Roman history, portions of universal history; geography and cos- 
mography; arithmetic and the-elements of geometry; elements of natural history, 
anthropology, experimental physics, and chemistry; elementary knowledge of Greek 
art and literature; domestic economy, domestic pedagogy, and the elements of 
hygiene; French and conversation in French, German and English optional; sketch- 
ing, vocal music, gymnastics, hand work, cutting and sewing, painting, molding 
in clay; piano and dancing are optional and at extra charges. 
Pupils may attend as interns (tpd¢ujz01), or-as half boarders (juctpddyuor), or as day 
scholars (éS@Tepixai). 
Tuition for interns is 1,400 drachmas a year; for half boarders, 20 drachmas a 
month in addition to what they would pay as day scholars, and for day scholars the 
tuition varies from 7 to 85 drachmas a month, according to the class the pupil is 
enrolled in. 
The half boarders take dinner in the school. The number of pupils is from 200to 
240 each year. 
Last year, 1896-97, the teaching body consisted of twelve women teachers and 
ten men professors. The professors teach such branches as the women teachers are 
not prepared to teach. 
THE UNIVERSITY.' 
(Td Mavertorijucov.) 
Since the sixth century, when Justinian closed the philosophical schools of Athens, 
down to the nineteenth there was little of higher education in Athens. ‘The city of 
the goddess of wisdom, where ouce triumphed art and letters and science, had become 
so insignificant that scholars of the West did not any longer know whether it yet 
existed. Martin Kraus asks this very question, Although recent archeological and 
historical investigation shows that Athens never ceased to exist, and that it was 
throughout all the middle ages an important if not a prominent city of the Byzan- 
tine Empire, yet it is true that Athens of those days had fallen, fallen. At the 
most it produced a scholar of repute now and then, such as the brilliant Evdoxia, 
who later became Empress. But there were no important institutions of learning 
nor any great teachers. The monastic schools, founded to replace the schools of 
philosophy, did good work in their way, but their aim was not high.

It was only after the return of liberty to Athens that a higher school of learning 
was again established. No sooner had the Greeks loosed themselves from the bonds 
of oppression than their old love of learning immediately reasserted itself. 
We have seen how the English wisely founded a college at Kerkyra, and how well 
it prospered. This school probably served as an incentive and a near model for the 
Greeks of the mainland. 
The years of Kapodistrias’s dictatorship passed away without the founding of a 
university. 
In 1834 the seat of government was transferred from Navplion to Athens. The 
transfer was made under Otho, who, after the death of Kapodistria, was appointed 
by the powers to be the first King of regenerated Greece. 
On the 31st of December, 1836, a royal decree was issued providing for the estab- 
lishing of a university, and regulating the details concerning the constitution of 
this future institution. This edict was promulgated during the absence of the King 
in Europe. The King, on returning, was not pleased with it, and in a decree of 
April 14 (26), 1837, he declared the previous decree null, and issued a temporary set 
of regulations for the proposed university. Then, on the 22d (3d) of April he issued 
a decree for its final establishment. This decree contains the names of the men 
appointed to be the first professors. It is published in Bambas (Néwoz rod Tavercornpior, 
pp. 64-70). Otho followed the custom prevalent in Germany, and named the uni- 
versity after himself, +d [averioripuov rod *"OBwvoc. 
A full system of schools from the lowest to the highest had been drawn up by 
Maurer, one of the regents during the minority of the King. (See Maurer, Das 
gtiechische Volk, etc., 1, pp. 188, and 215.) He proposed to have a Hellenic school 
in every eparchy, and in every province a gymnasion, and in Athens a university, an 
academy, and a school of art. His plan was to have the founding of the university 
take place in October, 1834, and that of the academy on November 2, his own birth- 
day. But he had been recalled to Germany before having an opportunity of putting 
his plans into act. He brought them with him to Germany, not wishing others to 
idly profit by them, nor his reputation to be jeopardized by their misuse or misin- 
terpretation. 
Otho’s decree was welcomed with joy. Only one determined voice was raised 
against it, the editor Lebides, in his journal, the E/7ic, fiercely attacked the founding 
of the university as premature. 
But what name was to be consecrated to serve as a translation for the European 
word ‘“‘university?” The institution founded in Kerkyra by the English bore the 
title of ‘“‘academy.” But the word Axad#yeca in its classical sense expressed some- 
thing different from a university, and besides the modern Greeks wished to use that 
word as a translation of the European word academy. Names such as Movoeiov, 
TlavdwWaxripiov were recalled, Other names that in Turkish times indicated a school 
of higher studies were ‘EAAnvouovaeiov, Abxecov, bpovtiothpsov, Tvuvdowv, These names 
though adaptable gave way finally to the new creation, Iavervorfucov. It certainly 
isa suitable word, expressing at least all that is implied in the ‘‘ Universitas Litera- 
rum et Scientiarum” of the West. 
The decree of 1837 contained a number of regulations which were to serve as a 
guide in all matters relating to the university until such time as a regular constitu- 
tion could be drawnup. This constitution, however, never came into existence; and 
the provisional regulations of the decree have served ever since as the basis of all 
university government, 
According to these regulations the university consists of four faculties, theology, 
law, medicine, and philosophy. Each faculty or school, consists of a definite num- 
ber of chairs or professorships. The professors of each school under the presidency 
of the dean, constitute an independent teaching body, inseparable, however, from 
the university, and in continual touch with the other schools, and under the general 
control of the senate of the university.
-P-A-G-E-389
  EDUCATION IN GREECE. 309 
The provisional regulations provided that the first professors should be appointed 
by royal decree, but that beginning with the year 1842 the several schools should 
elect their own professors. The mode of election was to be determined in the uni- 
versity constitution; but, since that constitution never came into existence, the 
Government continued to appoint directly all professors up to the year 1882. Since 
that year each school proposes the candidates and the minister of education formally 
appoints. i 
The King appointed twenty-three professors, two in the school of theology and 
seven in each of the other schools. It is easy to believe that Otho had a difficult 
task in finding twenty-three men capable of undertaking university work. True it 
is that he could find many that were willing to undertake the task, but yet there 
were scholars in Greece that loved duty more than dignity. One of these was Gen- 
nadios. Otho invited him to a chair in the university. Gennadios replied: ‘If 
we all make a jump for the university who will take care of the lower schools? 
They also are important.” Scholars were not scarce in Greece at that time, but other 
requirements beside scholarship are needed in a professor. To prevent all devastat- 
ing blunders he should have already been tried as a teacher in a lower school and 
found capable. Several of the first professors were Germans. That it should have 
been found wise to appoint these foreigners should not surprise us. They were men 
of experience. It is in no way a reflection on Greece. The Greeks should be proud 
to have been able to produce instanter an Asopios, a Leon Melas, a Misael Apos- 
tolides, an Argyropoulos, a Pallekas, a Kostes, a Kontogones. Among the German 
professors were Feder in the schoo] of law, Treiber in medicine, Ulrichs in Latin, 
Ross in archeology, and Landerer in chemistry. 
Ludwig Ross was a native of Denmark. He was also appointed custodian of 
antiquities. In this capacity, as in that of professor, he did much good. He under- 
took, however, to restore the Parthenon to its original condition. Archeologists and 
art lovers are glad that he did not have an opportunity of carrying out this attempt. 
He collected many inscriptions and other remains of antiquity that otherwise would 
have been lost. His descriptions of his journeys through different parts of the 
Kingdom are especially interesting, and useful as funds of historical, philological, 
geographical, and archeological information. 
Ulrichs was a native of Bremen. He died in Athens in 1843. Before receiving 
the appointment to a professorship in the university he was professor of Latin in 
the central gymnasion in gina, He came to Athens not as seeking a position, but 
as a Philhellene. 
These Germans adopted the modern pronunciation of Greek, and then, speaking 
in ancient or modern language, they were at once intelligible to their foreign 
audience. - 
The first four deans, then called SyoAdpya, but now Koougropec, were appointed, 
as were the professors, by royal decree. Now, however, each school elects its dean. 
The first rector, [[piravc, was also appointed by royal decree. This honor was 
given to Konstantinos Schinas. 
On the 8d (15th) of May, 1837, the official opening of the new university took 
place in the presence of Otho and his cabinet. The scene was so affecting that 
the King wept. The Bishop of Attika blessed the undertaking and chanted 
the Ev2dyntoc el ypioré. The Prytanis read an address proper to the occasion, as did 
each of the four deans. The first regular lecture took place in the following week, 
on the 22d of May. It was a lecture by Ludwig Ross, and on the Acharnians of 
Aristophanes. 
But where did all of this take place? No buildings had been erected to serve 
especially for the purposes of a university; and no large buildings already existed; 
in fact, oppression and war had reduced Athens to a mere collection of hovels. One 
building, however, was found sufficiently commodious for the immediate needs of 
the infant university, the house of Kleanthes, Oixia KiedrOove, This had already
-P-A-G-E-390
3810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
been used.as a gymnasion. It stood near the foot of the north slope of the Akropo- 
lis, in the “Plaka,” or, more exactly, in the Anaphiotika, a section so called because 
inhabited by settlers from the island of Anaphe. The house is still standing, 
although few seem to know its fame. It is now monastic property, being a posses- 
sion of the Church of the Holy Sepuicher, in Jerusalem (Metéyov tod Ayiov Tégov). 
(See"Eozepoc, vi, 24.) The Archeological Society is now preparing to excavate the, 
Anaphiotika quarter, and an old landmark will soon be destroyed. 
THE FIRST STUDENTS. 
When the university was founded, there were only three gymnasia in the entire 
Kingdom having the right to give dimissorials, and these had been in existence but 
afew years. Accordingly, there was not a large number of young men that could 
present themselves as trained candidates for a university course of studies. Tho 
three gymnasia then operating were those of Nayplion, Syros, and Athens. The one 
at gina had been discontinued, and its personnel and movable property transferred 
to the gymnasion of Athens. 
Tt was discovered that the number of regular students at the university would not 
be sufficient to enable the professors to teach their course in a satisfactory way. In 
order not to be impeded by this circumstance, two measures were resorted to. First, 
not only might all young men that had completed the course of studies in a gymnasion 
become full students, do:777a/, in the university, but also all the pupils of the highest 
class in the gymnasia were allowed to enroll themselves as full students without 
making their last year of the gymnasion course. Secondly, any person in a Govern- 
ment position, or any other person of good repute and some preparation, could be 
enrolled as auditor (Taxrico? axpoarai), This class of regularly enrolled auditors was 
recognized until 1844, when, on account of the sufficiently large number of regular 
students, there no longer existed any need of the auditors. But attendance at the 
lectures of the university has never been denied to anyone; so that the number of 
auditors has always been considerable, although not recognized officially. 
No one not a regular student could become a candidate for a degree. The regular 
auditors might receive testimonials stating what courses they followed as auditors. 
By the two concessions mentioned the university succeeded in gathering in 127 
men and boys, of which 52 were full students end 75 regular auditors. Of these 
there were in theology 8 full students, in law 22 students and 71 auditors, in medi- 
cine 4 students and 2 auditors, and in philosophy 18 students and 2 auditors. 
STUDENTS FROM UNREDEEMED GREECE, 
  But there was another difficulty to be met. Since the university was intended 
not only for the sons of inhabitants of free Greece, but for young men from all parts 
of the Greek world, some provision had to be made for the admission of students 
coming from abroad—from Turkey in Europe, from Asia Minor, from Egypt, etc. 
These applicants could not bring a dimissorial from a gymnasion, because gymnasia 
did not exist in most of the cities of these countries. Yet they were often quite 
well prepared to begin a university course, having studied in some good Hellenic 
school of the old type or having received private instruction. To do justice to 
these candidates a special committee of professors was appointed to examine them, 
and if found fit they were allowed to be enrolled as full students. This committee 
continued to exist until regular gymnasia had been established in most of the large 
Hellenic eenters abroad, and the young Greeks from outside the Kingdom could 
come with a regular dimissorial. The provisional government, which held sway for 
atime after the overthrow of Otho, abolished the committee by a decree of Septem- 
der 6, 1863 (see Bambas, p. 46, note), and since 1863 if a student comes from without 
the Kingdom, not haying a dimissorial, he is advised to present himself at a gymna- 
sion and pass the final gymnasial examination, and thus receive the regular certificate 
of admission to the university.
-P-A-G-E-391
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 311 
The sons of the unredeemed Greeks have shown themselves worthy of the conces- 
sions made to them. They appreciate the blessings of education even more than do 
those raised in the Kingdom of Greece. You can perhaps find no Greek village in 
all the country under the Crescent, be it in Europe or in Asia or in Africa, without 
finding the poor rajah saving up his groats in order to send ason to Athens to study. 
THE SECOND YEAR. 
Shortly after the formal opening the lectures were discontinued on account of the 
approach of summer. In the following September they were resumed, and thus the 
university entered upon its first full year of duty. For this year a programme of 
studies was issued according to the German system, with a learned archeological 
monograph by Professor Ross. To the school programme of the following year a 
like dissertation was prefixed on a theological subject. Thereafter, however, the 
custom of prefixing such dissertations was abandoned. 
During this year a second class of instructors was added, corresponding to privat 
docenten in the German universities. These igyynrai, as they are called, teach as 
independently as do the full professors, only they must find hours not occupied by a 
professor’s work for the same students. These docents receive no salary, 
THE FIRST DOCTOR. 
  Although university work went on regularly and earnestly, seven years elapsed 
before a candidate came forward to take the examinations for the doctorate. This 
lack of candidates was due to two causes, to the fact that the Government had not 
yet determined on the conditions for the doctorate, and that the better students 
were glad of an opportunity to go to Europe for a year or two to finish, while the 
less ambitious were satisfied with a mere certificate of the fact that they had made 
a university course. 
The Government first published the conditions for examination for the doctorate 
and the method of conducting the examinations in a deeree of May 19 (31), 1842. 
When in the year 1844 a candidate presented himself for examinations the event 
was an interesting one. The candidate was Anastasios Goudas, from Ioannina, one 
of the students that matriculated for the first opening of the university. He 
received his degree in medicine. In thesame year Konstantinos Kleanthes presented 
himself in the school of philosophy. Although a good student he failed in the oral 
examinations. Accordingly he left the university with no other title than that of 
redevodidaxtoc, Which meant that he had followed a full course. He afterwards 
became a teacher, and a successful one. Shortly before his death, which happened 
a few years ago, he finished and published in Triest an edition of Pindar in five 
volumes, . 
The new university, as can be clearly seen, was modeled after the German schools, 
and more especially after the universities of North Germany, on a plan originally 
drawn up by Professdr Brandis. Whether so close an imitation was wise or not is 
difficult to know. It is certainly wiser to imitate than to differ merely in order not 
to imitate. 
GREEK AND GERMAN PROFESSORS, 
There soon rose sharp friction between the Germans and the Greek professors. 
The result was that in 1843-Ross and Ulrichs lost their professorships. This was 
due, not so much merely to lack of harmony between the two sets of professors, as 
between the Greeks and Germans in general. In fact, a revolution broke out in 
Athens which had as its result the expulsion of all Germans from positions under the 
Greek Government. 
THE UNIVERSITY AND THE BOULK, 
On account of the high hopes the Greeks held for their university, and the influ- 
ence they expected it to have for good in the advancement of the interests of the
-P-A-G-E-392
    312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97 
race, it seemed not improper that the pera should have its representative in 
the Parliament or Boulé. 
When in September, 1843, the dissatisfaction of the people with the dictatorial 
policy of good King Otho ond the unsavory possession of all higher positions by 
Bavarian officeholders, caused an insurrection of the army, the sympathies of the 
university men were on the side of the people, although the professors were not for- 
ward in promulgating their democratic views. However, after the insurrection was 
an accomplished fact, and its results had been accepted by both King and people, 
they did not hesitate to refer to it approvingly even on official occasions. 
A result of this insurrection was that Otho conceded a constitution to the nation. 
A National Assembly, ’E@»cx) Zuvédevorc, was convened to vote on the acceptability of 
the constitution. The professors petitioned the assembly for a representative in 
the Boulé. Objection was made against the petition on the grounds that if such a 
privilege were conceded to the university, then also other corporations would de- 
mand the same right. Finally, however, by a vote of 119 to 44, the privilege was 
granted. The representative might be himself one of the personnel of the univer- 
sity, or he might be an outsider. 
The university accepted the coveted privilege and elected Alexandros Mayrokor- 
datos. He was a prominent politician. The appointment was not by any means 
pleasing to the Bculé, and it refused to recognize the appointment. 
In the following year the excellent professor of philosophy, Philippos Ioannou, 
was sent as representative, and was accepted. On the 5th of February, 1846, in a 
splendid oration before the Boulé, he defended and vindicated the action of the 
university in electing Mavrokordatos. (See the A0,va for February 7, 1846.) 
In the next National Assembly, which was convened in 1862 to heal the wounds 
made by the expulsion of Otho, the university was represented by two delegates. 
Their presence and right to be present was recognized by the Assembly, but it passed 
a decree depriving the university of all future representation in the Boulé. 
NAME OF UNIVERSITY CHANGED. 
The university continued to bear the name of its founder, Otho, as long as he 
continued to be King of the Greeks. But when in 1862, this Philhellene retired, the 
Greeks, prompted by their eternal spirit of democracy, changed the name of the 
university from ’09évevoy to ’EOvixdv Tavercorhucov, National University. The change 
was proposed by the minister of public instruction, and the Provisional Government, 
which then controlled affairs, immediately sanctioned the change on the 20th of 
October, 1862. Indeed the university, especially the students, was responsible in a 
great measure for the insurrection, With this change of name, and the part the 
university took in the insurrection, we are forced to recall the prophetic words of 
the old soldier, Kolokotrones, who on one occasion, pointing to the new building of 
the university and to the colossal marble palace of the King, which stands buta 
few squares distant, said: ‘‘This house will some day eat that house up,” Todro 7d 
omits 04 diy éxeivo 7d orirt, (See H6doudc, October 17, 1887.) 
The name of national was chosen because the Greeks regard the university not 
as the university of Athens, or of the free kingdom merely, but of all the Greeks. 
THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDATION. 
In May, 1887, the university celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation. 
Great was the pride of the Greeks over all the Eastern world. Telegrams and let- 
ters of congratulation and embassies came from all quarters. The feast of intellect 
lasted for three days. It began with religious services in the Metropolitan Church 
on the morning of May 17th, and ended with the presentation of a Greek drama, 
Sophokles’ Gidipous, the King. 
tn memory of this significant event the council of the university resolved that a 
chronicle be written giving the history of the first fifty years’ progress of the uni- 
versity. The honor of writing it was conferred on Prof. Iloannes Pantazides. He 
published the chronicle in 1889.
-P-A-G-E-393
  EDUCATION IN GREECE. 313 
A FEW OF THE MORE PROMINENT PROFESSORS. 
Many of the professors have been men of high attainments in their special line of 
investigation. The name of Asopios can not be omitted. Asopios had studied in 
Germany and taught in the Ionian Academy.! He was an enthusiastic admirer of 
the old philology. He wrote a grammar which served as a model for most of those 
that have since been written in Greek. In 1842, by royal decree, a seminary for the 
study of the Greek language was established in the university, and Asopios was 
appointed to be the first director. 
A professor remarkable for the influence which he possessed over the students was 
Theodoros Aphentoules. (See sketch of his life in the Iov«ity Zrod for 1894 by Dr. 
Petros Apostolides.) For fifty years he taught pharmacology in the university. As 
teacher he was as interesting as he was scientific. It was not rare for students of 
otherspecialties to attend his lectures regularly on account of the attractiveness 
of his teaching. He has added to modern Greek literature not only noteworthy 
treatises in his own science, but he was a lover of fine literature as well, and has left 
a volume of beautiful lyrics. 
He lived not in Athens, but in the Peireevs. There also he practiced as a regular 
physician. The entire city knew him, and knew him as a benefactor. He was often 
in serious humor called the tutelary deity of the city, MoAsovyog tov Merparic. He 
died a few years ago. 
The school of theology has not produced any great scholars, but it has produced 
someremarkablemen. Oneof the first professors was Kontogones, who taught from 
1837 up to the year of his death, in 1878. (See his life, by Pavlos Ioannou, in the 
Eorepoc, 11, 135.) Besides teaching continuously, and sometimes supplying for long 
periods of time other professorships for which there was no incumbent, he wrote a 
number of books that mark an epoch in the work of the school. Among these 
works are his ’Ercroyf ‘E6pacnge 'Apyasodoyiac, his Matpodoyta irot ioropia tov marépwv 
rig éxxAnoiag Tov mpdtov aidvor, an ‘HAAgviKy MvOodoyia, an 'Exirouoc eicaywyp ei¢ Tag 
Tpagdc, and 'ExxAnovacrixijc loropiag téuo¢ xparoc (his death prevented the completion 
of this latter work). He also edited for a number of years the EbayyeAcKoe Kfpué, 
an ecclesiastical and theological periodical which enjoyed high reputation: even 
outside of Greece. 
Speaking of eminent professors, it will not be out of place to mention two or three 
of those who are still living. 
In the school of philosophy, Konstantinos Kontos, whose compeers in his specialty 
are few, teaches the Attic language. Among his best known writings are his 
Tirocoixat Maparnphoerc, in which he sharply corrects many blunders made by modern 
students of the Attic, both Greek and foreign. 
Another philologian of highest worth is Georgios N. Hatzidakis, whose specialty 
is comparative philology as applied to the study of the Greek language, both ancient 
and modern. His writings in Greek and in German are numerous. His largest work 
is his Grammatik der Neugriechischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1892). 
Prof. Stephanos Koumanoudes must also be mentioned. On account of advanced 
age, he is no longer in active service. His services to philology and archxology 
are known the world over. He was for years one of the editors of the 'E¢yyepic 
"Apyatodoy:x) and of the AQ#vawv, Among his important books is his Aegixdv ’AOnoav- 
pioruv Agewr. 
The schools of law and medicine haye also produced a number of scientific men. 
The professors of the university are nearly all of the orthodox religion. But there 
is no religious test whatsover. Two of the professors are Catholics, and one of the 
docents is a Protestant, a former student of Harvard.

  314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
DOCENTS. 
Whoever wishes to become a docent, idnynric, brings to the dean of the school in 
which he desires a place his doctor’s diploma, a statement concerning the matter 
he intends to teach, and a habilitations dissertation on the same subject. The dean 
lays these before the faculty of the school. The faculty appoints a day for him to 
appear before them and lecture. If he shows himself a fit teacher, he is approved 
and recommended to the minister of education for appointment. If the candidate 
shows himself capable, the school can not refuse to appoint the day for his trial 
lecture, and can not refuse to declare his fitness. His appointment therefore depends 
almost entirely on his own worthiness. 
In the school of theology, since the doctorate is not regularly conferred, candidates 
for the i¢yyecia may present a diploma from the school of philosophy, together with 
astatement that they have heard a course in theology. If they have studied abroad, 
they may, of course, present their diploma from a foreign university. (See Bambas, 
Népor, pp. 44, 45.) 
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The highest governing power in the university is the senate, L6yxdyroc. The 
senate is made up of one dean and one other representative elected by vote from each 
of the four faculties, the rector, who is elected annually by the full body of profes- 
sors, and the proprytanis, or rector of the preceding year. These ten men then con- 
stitute the senate. They are amenable to the minister of education. The prytanis 
and deans hold office for one year; the other representatives for two years, two 
being elected each year. 
BENEFACTORS. 
The little Kingdom would not have been able to do so much for education were it 
not for the efficient aid of generous and patriotic individuals. The university, as 
the crowning institution in Greek education, has merited and received gifts, not 
only from Greeks, but also from Philhellenes, The Greeks, in giving of their wealth 
. to the support of the university, never lose thought of the national idea, and accord- 
ingly, moved by patriotism, their gifts are sometimes valuable, not for the amount 
given, but for the spirit of the donor. However, many a gift comes sufficiently 
large to be of grand service to the cause of higher education, A list of all gifts of 
sufficient size to entitle the giver to the rank of benefactor of the university was 
published complete up to the year 1872 by Rector Kastorches in his report for 
that year. The gifts since that date are mentioned in the yearly reports of the suc- 
cessive rectors. 
One of the most munificent donors was the Kretan Ph. Papadakis. He left the 
greater part of his fortune to the university. His gift netted 893,163 drachmas.’ As 
-a condition, Papadakis imposed the obligation of keeping three Scholars, giving 
each 100 drachmas amonth. Ij 3 country does not forget him, The grave of Papa- 
dakis, in the cemetery beyond the Tlissos, is adorned by a beautiful monument, made 
‘by the sculptor Broutos, representing Fame writing the name of Papadakis on a 
slab over his grave. On the gravestone is the following inscription: 
Awpeg ds rinve mepiooy enet € Aim’ aidy 
Movedwy vadv Wiepidwv trarov 
TG ketvov tauiat 7d8° dyahu’ éxi rim By COqxav 
Moi’ ebepyeoins éupevat abdvarov. 
(See 'Eorepoc August 15, 1881.) 
Other large donors are Bernardakes, Batopedinos, and the Ionides family, 
Another kind of benefactor is represented by Barnabas, the Kretan, who, having 
no money to give to the university, and yet desirous of doing what lay in his power, 
  
1A drachma is worth about 19.3 cents.
-P-A-G-E-395
  
  EDUCATION IN GREECE. 315 
gavo his pistols and yataghan to the astonished rector, Dr. Soutsos. (See Aoyodocta 
Dobroov, p. 25.) 
On another occasion the university fell heir to 20 drachmas, bequeathed to it in 
the will of Demetrios Oka, knife grinder. 
The names of the more munificent donors are written in letters of gold on two 
marble columns that stand on either side of the entrance to the aula magna of the 
university; and on the 30th of January of each year, the feast of the three great 
Hierarchs, the university celebrates solemn mass for all these benefactors, praying 
for the health and long life of the living and the repose of the soul of the departed. 
On this occasion a panegyric in their honor is spoken by one of the professors, This 
Mryndovvoy was first celebrated in 1842, when Professor Bambas spoke the panegyric. 
The feast of the three Hierarchs had long been a school feast among the Greeks. 
The university, although the recipient of many and generous gifts, did not and 
does not preclude other institutions from receiving other equally generous gifts. 
Thus, Prince Ypsilantis gave his whole fortune to found a school in Nayplion. The 
school still flourishes there. Others, like Arsakes, Barbakes, Rizares, etc., gave their 
good gifts elsewhere, These benefactors began their givings long before the estab- 
lishment of the independent kingdom, as we have already seen in speaking of schools 
in Turkish times. Tho Zozimas brothers should be especially mentioned. On 
account of the liberality and multiplicity of their gifts, they have been ealled the 
Greek Medicis. They aided education in Leghorn, Moscow, Ioannina, and elsewhere. 
It must be noted with sorrow that the money of the university has more than once 
been a temptation to the honesty of those in whose care it was confided. Accord- 
ing to reports lately handed in to Mr. Metaxas, the minister of education, some 
thousands of dollars were lost to the university in the year 1895-96 by carelessness 
of the rector and treasurer. 
Along with the benefactors of the university should be mentioned the men who 
have given sums of money the interest of which is to be used in the giving of prizes 
for the best work done in literary or scientific contests (dyavec, dywvofecia), Among 
these, one of special interest to us is the Cotting contest, 6 Korriyyewog ayév, estab- 
lished by Dr. Cotting, a distinguished physician of Boston. Most of these contests 
are open to all who wish to compete, and are not reserved exclusively to students. 
THE PRESENT UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS, 
From the very beginning of the life of the university in the ora KiedvOoue it was 
evident that larger and more suitable buildings would have to be provided as soon as 
possible. Asite for the main building of the new structures was selected, and the 
university authorities began to prepare for the undertaking. They had to rely 
entirely on the hopes of voluntary contributions, In the second year of the existence 
of the university Rector Ralles made an appeal for aid. Responses came immedi- 
ately. Among the first was the Greek community of Galatz, which presented a gift 
of the timbers and other wood needed. 
The building was begun with only 28,790 drachmas in the treasury. On July 2, 
1839, the corner stone was laid. (See 'EAAnvixoc Tayvdpéuor for July 9, 1839.) The build- 
ing did not proceed very fast, however, as the authorities kept within their resources. 
In November, 1841, one wing was brought to completion and was dedicated officially. 
This wing was immediately put into use, and from that time on the university has 
been housed in these new buildings. The entire structure was not completed until 
4 
ae THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. ! 
The library of the university has been created from gifts in money and in books 
from private individuals. It has been of no considerable expense to State or to 
university, and yet it is an excellent one, although not up to requirements in every 
respect. 
1 See 'H "WOvuny BibAoIh«n, id Eupavov)’, ‘Poidov.
-P-A-G-E-396
316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  Among the first books received for the university library was a gift of 52 volumes 
sent by Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts, in 1837. (See Aoyodocla yw, p. 14.) 
The first professors gave from their private libraries whatever they could spare. 
Among the benefactors the Greeks of foreign lands were, as usual, conspicuous. 
Among them was Demetrios Galanos, one of the earliest Sanskrit scholars in Europe. 
After living and studying a long time in Calcutta and Benares he came to Athens, 
where he died in 1833, leaving 36,000 drachmas to the university and his books to the 
library. A number of manuscripts of translations which he made from the Sanskrit 
are still in the library. Some of them were published by G. K. Typaldos, the first 
ephor of the university library. 
Since the completion of the new buildings of the new university up to the present 
time the library has been housed on the second floor of the main building, where it 
was naturally cramped for want of room. This fact gave opportunity to two rich 
brothers, natives of Zakynthos, who had amassed fortunes abroad, to benefit their 
fatherland by presenting it with a magnificent building to be used exclusively as a 
library. The splendid structure has been lately completed. It is in marble and of 
Doric style. It occupies and fills the square north of the university. On the facade 
is the inscription wxodou49n dandvaie tov adeAgov Baddavév. From the name of the 
donors the library is called the Ballianeion, BaAdvaveiov. 
The library is rich not only in old printed editions especially of Greek works— 
editiones principes, and other rare editions—but possesses a large number of manu- 
scripts. They are chiefly ecclesiastical or chronological works, and date from the 
fifteenth century down. They have been carefully examined by others, but especially 
by Mr. Sakkelion, who was an excellent paleographist. He died a few years ago. 
He published a number of smaller manuscripts, and made quite a complete catalogue 
of them all. 
There is no printed catalogue of all the departments of the library, but the making 
of such a catalogue has been in hand for a number of years, under the direction of 
Dr. Michael Deffner, assistant librarian. The theological, philosophical, and philo- 
logical portions of the catalogue have been published. : 
In many monasteries of Greece there once existed small libraries containing inter- 
esting old manuscripts. Most of what was valuable in these libraries, however, has 
been brought to Athens, especially to the university library, if not smuggled off 
to Europe. But in spite of this double and partly excusable despoliation, the 
monastery libraries contain even yet many a treasure. 
Besides the university library there are other large collections of books at different 
places throughout the Kingdom. In Athens itself is the library of the Boulé, second 
in importance only to that of the university. 
An interesting library is in Demitsana, a small town situated in the mountains a 
few miles east of Olympia. This library belonged to the famous school which 
Agapios remodeled in 1764. Many of the books were destroyed during the war. The 
wild Arkadians and Maniotes used them for making gun wads, Other of the more 
valuable works are nowin Athens. But still the library is important. It is kept in 
the Hellenic school building. Evthymios Kastorches, professor of Latin at the uni- 
versity, wrote an interesting monograph on this library. 
In Andritszna, a small town in the northern part of Messenia, is another note- 
worthy collection of books, It was a gift to the town by Agathophron Nikolopoulos, 
a native of Andritsena, who before the war of liberation traveled through different 
countries of the Levant, and having a great love for books, turned whatever money 
he made into the purchase of them. After Greece became free he gave them to his 
townsmen. It consists of about 20,000 volumes. Unfortunately, the books are not 
arranged and are not in the care of a librarian, but are stored up and are almost 
inaccessible. 
The above libraries are mentioned on account of the peculiar interest that attaches 
to them. Numerous other modern libraries are to be found scattered throughout 
the Kingdom, in gymnasia and elsewhere.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. 
SEMINARS. 
(®povrtoripta.) 
  The knowledge presented to students through lectures would be of little value if 
not tested and assimilated by actual work done by the students themselves. The 
university in its phrontisteria and laboratories offers to the student the opportunity 
of not only testing the truth of the statements of his professor, but of making 
investigation for himself along a line of inquiry similar to that he observes his 
teachers to be following. 
Of the phrontisteria the most important are those of Greek philology, of com- 
parative philology, of Latin philology, of history, the mathematical seminar, the 
pedagogical seminar, the anatomical seminar, and the zoological seminar. 
The chief laboratories are the following: Laboratory of general chemistry; labo- 
ratory of experimental physics; laboratory of pharmaceutical chemistry; pharmaco- 
logical laboratory; phytological laboratory; histological laboratory; mikrobiolog- 
ical laboratory; pathological laboratory; laboratory for pathological anatomy; 
anatomical laboratory ; botanical laboratory. 
In these laboratories the students carry on research work, under the direction of 
the proper professors or other instructors. Some of these laboratories are well 
equipped for original investigation, but the work usually done is not so much in 
search of originality as to acquire a certain amount of experience and knowledge 
needed in some practical profession; and the laboratories are fitted out chiefly with 
this end in view. Good original work is, however, continually being done both by 
professors and students. 
SCIENTIFIC COLLECTIONS. 
In addition to the seminars and the laboratories, the university possesses, or has 
at its disposal, various collections of objects that supplement or assist the work 
done in the seminars and laboratories. Of such collections the most valuable are 
the National Museum of. Antiquities, the Museum of Antiquities on the Akropolis, 
the Numismatical Museum, the Anthropological Museum, the Botanical Museum, the 
Pathological Museum, the Physiological Museum, and the Physiographical Museum, 
The Anthropological Museum is under the care of Dr. Klon Stephanos. It is espe- 
cially interesting on account of a collection of ancient skulls which Dr. Stephanos 
is engaged inmaking. He intends by means of comparative craniology to examine 
into what claims the modern Greeks have, from this point of view, to be regarded as 
blood descendants of the Greeks of classic times. He has skulls from the Mykenzan 
period, others from the tumulus at Cheroneia where the Theban legion fell fighting 
against Philip of Makedon, and others from other epochs of Greek antiquity. 
Beside the seminars, laboratories, and scientific collections, mentioned, there are 
also a number of other places where a student may acquire knowledge and expe- 
rience in certain lines. Some of these places are: 
(1) The Botanical Gardens, situated at a distance of about ten minutes’ walk from 
the Kerameikos gate, along the Holy Way which leads from Athens to Elevsis. 
(2) The Astronomical Observatory, on the summit of the Hill of the Nymphs, west 
of the city. It was built in 1842, at the expense of the Baron Sina of Vienna, who 
also expended large sums in equipping it. Dr. Julius Schmidt, who for years was 
director of this observatory, did splendid work here. During his directorship, which 
ended with his death in 1884, he wrote more than 400 astronomical monographs. The 
Prussian Government bought his Lunar Chart for 20,000 thalers. (See ‘Eomepoc, U1, 
340.) 
(3) Students have also access to the public hospital, the Eye Institute, and the 
Lying-in-Hospital. 
ENCYCLOPEDIA AND METHODOLOGY. 
In each school provision has been made to have the encyclopedia and methodology 
of the different sciences taught; otherwise in some sciences, such at least as theology  
-P-A-G-E-398
    318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
or philology, it would be impossible for the student to orientate himself without 
immense labors, and wrong orientation would destroy him as a scientist forever. 
The first teachers of encyclopedia and methodology were Kontogones in theology, 
‘Banibas in philosophy, Hertzogin law, and Bouros in medicine. 
THE SCHOOL YEAR. 
The year begins with the last two weeks of September and closes with the iast 
‘two weeks of May. During this time there are two breaks in the continuity of 
instruction, one a rest of a few days at Christmas time and the other at the Easter 
‘holidays, which last two or three weeks. The end of the Easter holidays is so close 
to the end of the scholastic year that most of the students from the provinces, if they 
go home for the holidays, do not return to the university before the following Sep- 
tember or October. All principal feast days of the church are holidays in the 
schools, and as these feast days are quite numerous free days come often. 
So far as the students are concerned, there is nothing special, other than the enroll- 
ments at the beginning of the sessions, to mark the opening or the close of the semes- 
ters, as there are no examinations or other such exercises set exclusively for these 
times. 
  MATRICULATION, 
The only condition for admission to the university is to present a proper dimis- 
sorial from one of the gymnasia of the Kingdom. Butif the applicant is from abroad, 
his:dimissorial must be from a gymnasion recognized by the Greek authorities. The 
gymnasia mostly concerned are the Greek schools of the Turkish Empire and Egypt. 
‘The following schools in Turkey are officially recognized as being on equal footing 
with the gymnasia of Greece: The Grand National School at Constantinopol; the 
‘Theological School on the Island of Chalke; the Greek Business School of Constan- 
finopol, Buropixn Zxo%4; the Zozimean School of Ioannina; the Theological School 
of Jerusalem; all of which have been recognized from the beginning. The following 
have heen officially recognized in the year indicated for each one: The Evangelical 
School of Smyrna, in 1862; the Gymnasion of Chios, in 1863; of Samos, in 1872; of 
Thessalonika, in 1875; of Mitylene, in 1875; of Bitolia,in 1884; of Herakleion, in Krete, 
in 1883; of Kydonia and of Neapolis, in Krete, in 1884; the Zariphwan Schools of 
Philippopolis, in 1885. 
If the applicant ftom abroad has no dimissorial, his only resource is to present him- 
self for examinations.in a gymnasion of Greece. If he brings.a dimissorial with him, 
it must be attested by the consul of that Government at Athens, or by the Greek 
consul in the country of the gymnasion in question. In August, 1875, the president 
of Harvard University wrote to the rector of the Greek university regarding condi- 
tions for admission of Harvard students to the university. The rector replied that 
inthis regard the students in question would be treated just as citizens of Greece. 
(See Hpaxrixd Svyn2vfrov, for August 17, 1874; and Pantazides’s Xpovixdy, p. 285.) 
Enfollments are made only at the beginning of the semesters. They must be 
renewed at the beginning of cach following semester. After enrollment the student 
is his own master. He is swpposed to attend regularly and to become, as soon as 
possible, a member of such seminars or a worker in such laboratories as his science 
demands. But, however, if he neglect these obligations he will not thereby create 
any disturbance for himself until his time for examinations come; then he will 
probably fail. Ifhe become a member of laboratory or seminar, he is obliged to do 
such tasks as his professor imposes or recommends; otherwise he is free to study as 
he pleases. He has no examinations except those for degrees. 
COURSES OF STUDIES, 
With the exception of the students of pharmacology, all candidates for degrees 
must follow two courses of studies. One of these courses is made up of what are

THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY. 
To obtain entrance as student into the school of pharmacy the applicant must 
present not only his dimissorial from a gymnasion but also a testimonial from a 
recognized pharmacist stating that the candidate has studied with him for one year 
after completing his course in the gymnasion, and has therefore a year’s experience 
in practical pharmacy. 
The course of studies in theschool of pharmacy covers three years. The branches 
taught are as follows: 
First year: General experimental chemistry; experimental physics; zoology; 
botany; pharmacology; pharmaceutical chemistry; experiments in the laboratory of 
general chemistry. 
Second year: General experimental chemistry ; experimental physics; mineralogy; 
botany; practice in the botanical laboratory; pharmacology; pharmaceutical chem- 
istry; practice in the laboratory of pharmaceutical chemistry. 
Third year: Toxicology; practice in the laboratory of pharmacology; pharmaceu- 
tical chemistry; practice in the laboratory of pharmaceutical chemistry. 
EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREES. 
  The degrees conferred in course are that of licentiate in theology (IIpoAbrne rH5 
Geodoyiac), master in philosophy, and doctor in philosophy, law, and medicine. In 
pharmacy a diploma, but no degree, is given. 
As already said, the university students undergo no entrance examinations nor 
~ yearly examinations. 
The examinations in the general studies have been mentioned already. 
The masters’ examinations (Acdackaicxal é£erdoeic, éerdoere ‘BAAnvodidacKdAwv) are 
open to all students that have completed a two years’ course in the school of philos- 
ophy and have already successfully passed the examinations in the general studies. 
The candidate is examined in Greek, Latin, archeology, and mathematics. ‘ 
To be able to offer one’s self for the doctor’s examinations (d:daxropixal e&etacéuc) 
one must have completed a four years’ course of university work, either at the 
University of Athens or at some other university. It is not necessary that the can- 
didate be enrolled as a student of the university at the time of his examinations. 
The candidates must have already passed the general examinations. 
The doctors’ examinations, are both written and oral. If a candidate fail in his 
examinations, he may present himself again after the lapse of a year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
EDUCATION IN GREECE. S21 
The examinations for the doctorate, especially in the school of philosophy, are 
much more severe than in other universities. On the other hand, but little impor- 
tance is attached to the written dissertation. The candidate is not obliged to pub- 
lish it; it is sufficient that he leave a copy of it plainly written in the archives of 
university. From the year 1844 up to the year 1853 all candidates for the doctorate 
were entirely excused from the obligation of presenting a dissertation. The disser- 
tation may be written in Latin or Greek. Philologians must write their Greek dis- 
sertations in the ancient language. All other candidates may write in modern Greek. 
The first dissertation ever presented in Latin was that of Konstantinos Hadjideme- 
triou, on Studia Vergiliana in 1895. Professor Sakellaropoulos, in accepting the 
dissertation, took occasion to state that he was glad to finally see a dissertation in 
Latin, and bases his approval of the dissertation on the fact of its being in that 
language. (See his approval of the dissertation published with same.) 
After the dissertation has been accepted by the faculty, a day is appointed for the 
formal conferring of the degree. 
CONFERRING OF THE DOCTORATE. 
  (Avayépevars.) 
The formal conferring of the degree takes place in the presence of the rector, the 
dean, and the professors under whom the candidate studied. The affair is a public 
one, but of course the university does not send out invitations. The candidate 
invites his friends. 
The dean calls the candidate, who then reads the doctor’s oath. This is different 
for each'school. It is written in Hellenic for all schools save that of medicine, which, 
out of regard for the old physicians of antiquity, Hippokrates, Galenos, etc., has 
its oath in Ionic. It is sufficiently interesting to be quoted here.

After the reading of the oath the dean confers the degree, with the permission of 
the Prytanis and in the name of the school. 
EXAMINATIONS FOR DIPLOMA IN PHARMACOLOGY. 
To obtain a diploma in pharmacology, the candidate must have completed three 
years in the university and have already passed a written examination in botany, 
chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and geology, as well as 
on the subject of his experiments in the laboratories of chemistry and pharmaceuti- 
eal chemistry. 
He is examined by a board, consisting of the professors of phytology, chemistry, 
pharmaceutical chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and geology. If he passes the 
examination, he receives his diploma; if he fails, he may appear before the board, 
after the lapse of a year and try again. 
ED 97, 21   
 
-P-A-G-E-402
322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Six months from the time of his receiving his oaks he may appear before a 
board of physicians (latpoovvédpiov) and pass examinations for permission to practice, 
provided that he bring testimony showing that he has devoted the six intervening 
months to practical work in a recognized pharmacy. 
PHYSICIANS’ EXAMINATIONS FOR LICENSE TO PRACTICE. 
After a student has won his degree of doctor in the school of medicine, he then 
visits the director of the city clinic, who enrolls him among those that may study 
and practice there. After studying in the clinic for nine months he presents himself 
for examinations for permission to practice (xpaxrixai eerdcec), He is then examined 
in pharmacology, medicinal jurisprudence, surgery, and midwifery, as well as in 
medicinal and surgical clinics in the hospital. 
| HONORARY DEGREES. 
The university has fortunately kept itself away from the temptation of giving 
honorary degrees. The only school that has shown any strong tendency to giving 
such degrees is the school of theology. This school has conferred eight or nine. 
But for a school that has been in operation for sixty years this number is not large, 
The school of law has conferred two, namely, on Leon Gambetta, in 1879, and on 
Zachariae yon Lingenthal, in 1884. Both men deserved well of Greece, the one as a 
statesman, the other as professor and writer on Byzantine law. 
The school of medicine has conferred one honorary diploma, on Prof. Rudolf Vir- 
chow, on the occasion of his visit to Athens in 1879. 
The school of philosophy has never given an honorary degree. 
| THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT. 
  The Greeks of to-day, like their renowned ancestors, are exceedingly clannish. 
This clannishness is naturally found among the students of the university. Those 
from the same locality usually go together. On this account they never have formed 
any large and lasting societies other than those in which the membership is limited 
to students from certain provinces or countries. 
Although the student is not a strong social or political factor, yet at times he 
makes himself and his influence felt. He has always been ready to take up his gun 
and act the patriot soldier whenever occasion offered itself. This showed itself in 
1862, when the insurrection against the rule of King Otho brought disorder every- 
where. The students then organized themselves, together with the professors, intoa 
military body of about 600 men. They drilled regularly, professor standing side by 
side with student in the ranks, and served honorably and efficiently as city guards 
until peace was restored. They patrolled the city night and day. The good services 
of this body of military students and professors () Mavervornpiax) gddayé) were so 
evident that no haste was shown to disband it after the trouble was over. It thus 
continued to exist legally until the year 1878. 
The students are as a rule quite orderly, yet at times their hot southern blood con- 
trolsthem. Their clannish spirit sometimes brings them to take sides with one rival 
professor against another, or with one docent against another. Sometimes they 
express their likes and dislikes so strongly as to necessitate the temporary closing of 
certain lecture rooms or laboratories. (See Mistriotes év roic card rv Mpuravetay airov, 
1890-91, p. 75.) 
When these outbursts of sentiment or displeasure take place the students inter- 
ested, if numerous, often hold their meetings in the open square in front of the maim 
buildings of the university or in the portico of the main entrance. This entrance 
is called “the Portals,” rd Wportta, And a call to the students made through 
the daily papers to meet at a certain hour at the Propylea indicates that some 
affair of importance to the students, or perhaps of trouble to the authorities, is in 
the air. When these meetings take on a political character, or are demonstrations
-P-A-G-E-403
EDUCATION IN GREECE. 323 
against some measure of the Government respecting education or students, the police 
are sometimes employed to disperse them. Once, under the excitement of protesting 
against the taxes levied on all students by way of fees by Minister Trikoupes, their 
meeting was cut short by the sudden appearance of a company of firemen with 
engines, who turned full streams of water on the crowds of students, and they, 
drowned into submissiveness, dispersed. 
At times the students act boisterously not only on account of matters that closely 
affect them as students, but from other motives. Every Greek is a politician; 
accordingly, the student can not refrain from coming at times under political influ- 
ence. A notable instance is that of the Skiadists, Zxvadicrai. These were young 
students, who in the spring of 1859 wore large straw hats, oxddia, made in Siphnos, 
They wore them not only on account of their cheapness, but as a protest against 
imported European articles, and as a protest in general against the Government. 
They were ridiculed and mocked by other young men, not students, of an opposite 
faction, This led to riotous disturbances and caused the closing of the university 
for several days. These demonstrations of the Skiadists were the forerunners of the 
insurrection of October, 1862, which resulted in Otho’s expulsion. 
The university students represent by parentage no one class of society; the lowest 
origin does not make young Greeks hesitate, they being the most democratic of peo- 
ples. The son of the shepherd or of the gardener is conscious of no vital inferiority 
to the son of the Chian banker or the Phanariote of Constantinopol; and on the 
feast day the banker’s son and the Phanariote and the descendant of the patriot 
of 1821 will touch glasses with the rudest peasant. This easy equality, which exists 
everywhere, exists also among the students. 
The great love of education and the desire of every community and every family 
of any prominence whatsoever to have a representative in the ‘aristocracy of 
science” causes the higher schools, and especially the university, to be overcrowded. 
These doctors, after finishing their studies and enjoying the felicitations of their 
friends, find it difficult to earn their daily bread at times. 
It would be better for science and for the general advancement of the nation if 
the higher ranks of education were more exclusive. 
WOMEN STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY.! 
  Although woman is highly respected in Greece, yet, as we have already seen, it is 
only of late that she has been brought into a position to seek the advantages of 
more than an ordinary book education. But the women of Greece, no matter what 
their rank, possess a certain natural intelligence and refinement that atone for much 
learning derived from books. 
Tho entire system of education, as established immediately after the war, was 
intended for boys. True it is that schools were established for girls, but these 
schools were conducted on a different scale from those for boys. The curriculum of 
studies was simpler. It is only after the Philekpaedevtike Etaeria had taken the 
matter in hand that more attention was paid to the education of girls, Through 
the efferts of this society they came to have schools equal almost to the gymnasia 
for boys. 
But the ambition for higher studies once aroused and allowed to manifest itself, 
did not stop with the curricula of the gymnasia, and bright young maidens soon 
thought of applying for admission to the university. In autumn of the year 1890 
when Mistriotes was rector (see Mistriotes rd card rv Iputaveiav, 1890-91), two or 
three young women applied for the privilege of being enrolled as regular university 
students. The matter was referred to the senate of the university. The senate, 
although not in favor of allowing women to be enrolled, nevertheless felt that they 
could not justly forbid their enrollment, and accordingly gave their consent. The 
1 See H ‘EAdue év 1H Emorhyy ir wyeviag Loypagov, in the ArAavric for 1892. 
   
-P-A-G-E-404
324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
minister of education was also consulted by the senate, and likewise did not forbid 
the enrollment. Since that time nearly all the courses of the university are open to 
women. The first to take advantage of this new privilege was Miss Ioanna 
Stephanopoli, who matriculated that very year. 
Naturally the number of applicants for the new privilege did not swell into large 
proportions, because the number of graduates from the Arsakeion and other schools 
that could prepare candidates for the university, was not large. However, in the 
year 1894-95 we find the number of woman students increased to five. Once admitted, 
they begin to show their ability to follow their courses intelligently—for in the year 
1896-97, two sisters, Angelike and Alexandra Panagiotou, from the Island of Kephal- 
lenia, finished their course in the school of medicine, winning the doctorate with the 
grade of dpiora. 
But even before the doors of their own university were opened to women, they 
had sought the privilege of higher education elsewhere. The first Greek woman to 
study in a university seems to have been Sebaste N. Kallispere. She studied in the 
Sorbonne, and received the degree of doctor in philosophy in July, 1891, after a 
course of studies covering a period of seven years. Her example was followed by 
Miss Kalopothakes, who studied medicine in Paris, and is now a prominent and kind 
physician at Athens. 
GREEKS IN THE UNIVERSITIES OF EUROPE. 
Before the Greeks became free it was customary, as we have seen, for many young 
men to go to Europe in order to enjoy the advantages of education. This practice 
of going to Europe is still more common than need be. -Three classes of students 
go to Europe, (1) those that are desirous of pursuing some line of study not yet well 
tanght at Athens, or who, after having completed their course at Athens, wish to 
know and to study under eminent Europeans; (2) those that imagine it to be more 
noble to study abroad than in one’s own country, and (3) those who fear that they 
might have difficulty in passing the examinations in their own university. This last 
class is not so small as one might think. 
Mr. Demetrios Bikelas, in an article on ‘ Paris and light literature” (Ta Tapio 
kal } dagpa grdodoyia, in his AvaAéFege nat Avapvyoeic, 1893), well describes the bad 
effect that Parisian life has on some of the young Greeks that go there to study. 
THE POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE.! 
  (Td MerodBevov Hodvrexvetov.) 
During the days of oppression the Greeks had little opportunity of learning or of 
practicing the finer arts. With the exception of architecture and painting nothing 
in this line was needed. Even architecture produced no new principles, and paint- 
ing flourished only in a few centers such as Mount Athos. (See Die Kunst in den 
Athos-Klostern, von Heinrich Brockhaus, Leipzig, 1891.) Painting, too, had lost all 
of its life, and was a mere reproduction of stereotype forms as can be seen from the 
manual of Christian Ikonography by Dionysios of Agrapha. Epyuzveia tov Loypdguv

also; Manuel @’Iconographie Chrétienne, Grecque et Latine, Paris, 1845. 
Accordingly when the Greeks gained their independence they had much to do in 
this line. Kapodistrias made a good beginning by sending to Italy some young men 
who wished to study the fine arts. 
In the year 1836 a royal decree was published on the last day of the year, estab- 
lishing a school, where on Sundays and holidays instruction in architecture was to

be given to such as wished to become builders, ete. Thus began the Polytechnic 
Institute. 
The measure was a popular one, and the school continued to operate under these 
conditions until 1843. During these six years the school was under the management 
of Zetner, a mechanician from Munich. Two thousand three hundred and ninety 
men took advantage of these courses in architecture. Although no architects were 
created—that would be impossible under the circumstances—yet the school did 
much good by producing a number of trained workmen and builders. Such men 
were mnch needed, as entire cities had to be built up. 
The changes in the Government brought in by the events of 1843 caused modifica- 
tions in this school, as it caused them in almost every other institution of the country. 
The school was rearranged into three departments. The first of these departments 
was intended for those who wished to learn some kind of skilled workmanship, In 
this department instruction was given only on Sundays and holidays. The second 
department was for those who wished to learn the arts and sciences connected with 
manufacture. This school was open daily. The third department was devoted to 
the fine arts. The institute continued to operate on this plan up to the year 1863. 
During this second period attention was paid to the fine arts, especially to sculpture, 
engraving, and ornamental design. The director of the institution was Lysandros 
Kaftansoglos, an architect of high ability, and an advocate of the study of the fine 
arts. Accordingly these flourished under his enthusiastic management. During this 
period the school was attended by 8,941 students. 
In August, 1863, the Provisional Government reorganized the institution again, 
establishing a school of the applied arts, a school of the fine arts, and a school in 
which instruction was given on Sundays. The school of applied arts (Bioreyvixdy 
Zyodciov) ceased to exist under this name in 1891. During this period this school 
was remarkably successful. It was attended by 5,396 students. In 1891 it was 
thoroughly reorganized and now bears the name of the Zyodciov tév Bioynyavov 
Texyvov. It is to-day the principal and most prosperous school of the Polytechneion. 
The other schools need remodelling and revivification. Plans have been drawn up 
for this purpose, but have not yet been approved of by the Boulé. The present 
director of the institution is Mr. A. Theophilas, who has held the position since 1878, 
The school of the fine arts has been making good progress. It has produced sculptors 
and painters and architects that reflect honor on their country. Among the sculp- 
tors Leonidas Droses and Georgios Broutos are worthy of mention. Droses was pro- 
fessor of sculpture from 1868 up to the time of his death in 1882. Broutos is at present 
professor of sculpture. 
Since 1893 the school of the fine arts has been open to women students. Within 
the last four years 361 women students have availed themselves of this privilege. 
The splendid buildings in which the schools are held are gifts of three natives of 
the town of Metsobo. Hence the name of the institution, Merod6evov MoAvreyveiov. 
CURRICULUM OF STUDIES IN THE POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTION.

THE ODEION. 
This is an establishment for the purpose of producing musicians, singers, and 
actors for the Greek stage, and also for preparing teachers of music for the different 
schools throughout the kingdom. As a school of preparation for the stage, it has 
not as yet produced any remarkable results, but as a school for teachers of music in 
the public schools it has done much good. 
The system of instruction embraces five different departments—a preparatory
-P-A-G-E-407

school, a school fer instrumental music, a school for vocal music, a school for the 
theory of music, and a dramatic school. 
In the dramatic school are taught enunciation, declamation, voice culture, calis- 
thenics, nature and quality of dramatic personifications, rhythm and meter in lan- 
guage, personification of characters both theoretically and practically. 
Beside these special courses all students at the Odeion must, unless excused on 
grounds of proficiency, take the history of music, the history of the theater, general 
literature, and the French and Italian languages.

  THE ACADEMY. 
Ever since they have become free it has been the dream of educated Greeks to 
have an organized body of learned men, such as those of the academies of France, 
Germany, and other countries of Europe. That wish has not been fulfilled. But 
although an academy of immortals does not exist in Greece, a suitable edifice has 
nevertheless been erected for their use. The building is the gift of a rich Greek, 
Baron Sina, of Vienna. The architect was Hansen. It is in Ionic style, and is per- 
haps the most beautiful of all the new edifices in Athens. It is entirely of Pentelic 
marble. 
At present its chief use is to serve as 2 numismatic museum, where the immense 
and valuable collection of coins, ancient Greek and Byzantine, is preserved. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Private schools are numerous, both for girls and for boys, and are of all grades, 
from the demotic to the gymnasion. Of these private institutions some are under 
special religious influence, but others and most of the private schools are different 
in no way from the regular schools, except for a more careful and parent-like watch- 
fulness over the pupils in time of recreation, and greater solicitude for their con- 
duct, ete. Some of the private schools also receive boarders, which the regular 
schools do not do. 
The establishment of private schools is subject to no unpleasant restrictions on 
the part of the Government. The courses of studies must conform to what the Goy- 
ernment requires, the teachers must possess a regular license, and the law concern- 
ing the teaching of religion must be obeyed. When these conditions are likely to 
be fulfilled, the formal permission to conduct a private school is immediately granted. 
School terms begin and end at the time appointed by law. Examinations are con- 
ducted in the same way as in the public schools, and the department of education is 
represented on the board of examiners. 
Whoever is found guilty of establishing or conducting a school without attending 
to all the requirements of the law, is subject to punishment under article 532 of the 
penal law of the Kingdom, 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS UNDER SPECIAL RELIGIOUS DOMINATION, 
Circumstances have brought it about that the modern Greeks identify their reli- 
gion with their national existence. They love its magnificent ritual, its gorgeous 
ceremonial, its fine mysticism, its subtile dogma. Religion bound and binds them  
-P-A-G-E-408
328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  all into one body. It identifies itself as a personal possession with every Greek, 
whether plebeian or aristocrat. * * * 
Since the Greek loves his church so intensely, he naturally dislikes all destructive 
opposition to it. He may not see anything intrinsically bad in other forms of Chris- 
tian worship, yet he dislikes them if they threaten to bring about the destruction of 
his own religion. On these grounds he is opposed to the introduction of foreign 
forms of Christianity into his country and among his people. He has ceased to 
desire to proselytize, thinking that the other varieties of Christianity are good 
enough in theirown home. Since schools are powerful means for introducing new 
religions, he has always looked with suspicion on schools established under control 
of teachers of another religion. Viewing the matter from the Greek’s standpoint, 
we wonder at his liberal leniency. The establishment of such schools has always 
been allowed, although at times there have been popular outbreaks against indi- 
vidual schools. 
The first to establish schools of this kind were various orders of Catholic religions. 
The Jesuits, for instance, had excellent schools in Andros and Melos and Naxos 
and elsewhere in the seventeenth century. 
Religious communities of nuns and sisters have also established schools in most of 
the large cities of Greek lands. In free Greece there are such schools in Athens, 
Patras, Kerkyra, Tenos, Naxos, and elsewhere. These schools are intended chiefly 
for the children of Catholic inhabitants, citizens, and resident foreigners, and no 
attempt at proselytizing is made. Though not intended for children of Orthodox 
Greeks, yet such parents often send their daughters to these schools in order to have 
them learn French, which is taught practically in these schools. This attendance of 
Orthodox children sometimes brings about unpleasant friction between the follow- 
ers of the two religions, for at times there appears a suspicion of proselytizing, and 
this is forbidden expressly by the constitution. In 1869 and 1870 the Catholic 
schools of Kerkyra gave rise to such talk that the matter was brought before the 
Boulé in Athens. And under date of March 3, 1871, Mr. A. Petmezas, minister of 
education, issued a circular to the nomarchs of the country enjoining the strict 
inforcement of the law concerning schools under other religious influences. He 
emphasizes the fact that instruction in religion must be given by a teacher of the 
same religion as that of the pupils. (OecpoAdyiov, 1, pp. 391, 392.) 
The most important school under Catholic management is the Leonine Lyceum in 
Athens (Td Aedvrecov Avxecov), established by Pope Leo XIII at the time of the cele- 
bration of his Golden Jubilee. The school is intended for the sons of Catholics. It 
ranks as a gymnasion, and its courses are fully in accordance with the requirements 
of the State. It has an excellent corps of professors. 
Protestants have also established schools in Greek lands. In 1831 the Hill school 
was founded. 
  THE HILL SCHOOL.! 
(Td TapSevayayetor XiAA.) 
This school takes its name from its founders, Dr. and Mrs, Hill. On the 7th of 
December, 1830, Mr. and Mrs. Hill landed in Syra, one of the islands of the Greek 
Archipelago. They had been sent to Greece by the Missionary Society of the Prot- 
estant Episcopal Church. Mr. Hill, a graduate of Columbia College, New York, 
had studied theology in the seminary at Alexandria, Va., and was ordained a clergy- 
man shortly before his departure for Greece. After living a few months on the island 
of Tenos, whither they had gone from Syra, they went to Athens, where, on July 18, 
1831, they opened a school in their own house. The school prospered and did much

good. The Hills, at the advice of the missionary society, and with their own good 
taste, supported by their knowledge of how the Athenians felt toward proselytizers, 
carefully abstained from meddling with the religion of their pupils. Still, since 
religious exercises were held in the school, such as the reading of portions of the 
Bible, the recitation of the Nicene Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, etc., the Greeks felt 
uneasy. This suspicion grew into open attack in 1842, led and encouraged by the 
Avoy, one of the most influential papers of Athens at that time. However, the storm 
blew over and the school continued. 
Almost from the beginning the Hill institution consisted really of two schools— 
one a free school supported from America, and the other a private school supported 
by its income from the pupils. This private school continues to the present time, 
and is now under the management of Miss Masson. The free school is also still in 
existence, and is under the management of Miss Muir. 
In 1869 Dr. Hill resigned the control of the free school on account of his age. He 
died at Athens, July 1, 1882. The Greek Government honored his funeral, and the 
common council of Athens resolved to erect a marble column in memory of his sery- 
ices in behalf of education. 
Two years later Mrs. Hill died and was buried beside her husband in the English 
cemetery at Athens. An account of her funeral was sent to the State Department at 
Washington by Mr. Eugene Schuyler, then minister to Greece, under date of August 
6, 1884. He mentions the honors shown her and the sympathy expressed. 
After the death of its founders, it was decided to continue the private school as a 
memorial school. Three thousand pounds sterling were raised, and with this the 
school property was purchased. The private school is not now under the care of the 
mission, but is supported entirely by the tuition fees and an occasional gift from 
America. 
During the scholastic year of 1896-97 this private school accommodated 30 boarders 
and 120 day pupils. In spite of the fact that the school is sadly in need of funds, it 
continues to retain its high standard under the prudent control of Miss Masson. Its 
pupils always excel in the examinations. 
TURKISH AND JEWISH SCHOOLS IN THESSALY. 
After the addition of Thessaly and a small portion of Epeiros to Greece in 1881, 
the Greek Government immediately devised means of providing for the education of 
such of the inhabitants of the new provinces as were not of the Greek faith. These 
were Mussulmans and Jews.! 
The Government made provision that wherever the size of a Jewish or Mussulman 
community warranted it a special school should be established for them. In the 
Jewish schools were to be taught, along with the courses of regular Greeks schools, 
lessons in Hebrew and in religious instruction by teachers appointed by the Jewish 
church authorities. Likewise in the Mahometan schools were to be taught the 
Turkish language and the elements of Persian or Arabic, together with the tenets of 
the Mahometan religion, by teachers appointed by Mahometans in the different 
villages. Greek, however, and the other common branches were to be taught by 
teachers possessing the qualifications demanded for a teacher in the other parts of 
the Kingdom. 
This shows the generosity of the Government in matters of education. In Ker- 
kyra, also, there is an excellent Jewish school which receives aid from the State. 
ECCLESIASTICAL SEMINARIES. 
Since the church is such an essential part of Greek life and nationality, it is quite 
natural that provision should be made for the betterment of the intellectual con- 
dition of its functionaries. * * * 
  
1 See Beopoddyiov, 1, pp. 137-139, 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  One of the first cares of the governor, Kapodistrias, was to establish a seminary 
on the island of Poros, in the monastery of the Zwoddyoc Iyy}, or Life-giving Foun- 
tain. The school was to be supported from the revenues of the monastery. But the 
school was not received with favor by the clergy. It was not a school for theology, 
but merely a school for elementary studies. It was not intended to make priests 
scholarly, but merely genteel. The school ceased to exist shortly after the death of 
Kapodistrias. 
A greater and more lasting foundation for the good of the church is due to Geor- 
gios Rizares. (See Td card riv Puldpecov 'Exkdnovacrinyy oxoagy and rig ovordcews abriic. 
éxtpedeia Nucoddov Paddov, év 'AOjvaic, 1891.) Georgios Rizares and his brother Manthos 
were natives of Monodendrion, near Zagori, in Epeiros. In 1806 they began a suc- 
cessful career as merchants in Moscow. They were known from the very beginning 
of their career as philanthropists. In 1814 they established a Hellenic school in 
their native town and supported it until the outbreak of the revolution. They gave 
large sums of money to Alexandros Ypsilantis and to the Philike Hetweria, They 
gave money for the freeing of captives. They defrayed the expense of the editing of 
Greek texts, etc. But their most lasting work was the founding of the seminary. 
Georgios Rizares, in memory of his brother and himself, gave a sum of money large 
enough to build the institution and to support 20 students. It was dedicated May 
15, 1844, King Otho, with his ministers, was present. The bishop of Attika, 
Metaxas, performed the ceremony. In the following year it opened its doors to 
students. It is modeled somewhat after the Catholic seminaries of Europe. 
Candidates are received into the Rizareion on the following conditions: The ap- 
plicant must be a citizen of Greece. Ten exceptions, however, are made in favor of 
students from Zagori. He must be not less than 15 years old and not more than 18. 
He must be of sound mind and body. He must have completed the course given in 
the Hellenic schools. He must declare his intention of taking orders; if afterwards 
he change his intention, he agrees to pay an amount equivalent to what is ordi- 
narily spent on each scholar. 
The course of studies given in the Rizareion covers five years. Of these, the four 
under courses correspond to the courses given in the gymnasia with the addition of 
such studies as candidates for the priesthood should also pursue. The fifth year is 
devoted to purely theological studies. 
The seminarists live in community life. They study in common halls, eat in a 
common dining hall, sleep in common dormitories, take recreation together, etc. 
No student may leave the premises without permission, At a regular hour every 
afternoon all walk out into the city in a body, or tosome suburb. All wear robes of 
thesame pattern—a black cap without peak and with a flat top, a black loose cassock 
held neatly by a blue girdle, and a black loose long coat with flowing sleeves worn 
over the cassock. 
From the end of June up to the 25th of August the seminarians enjoy vacation 
from classes, but they are not free to leave the institution and spend their holidays 
elsewhere except for some strong reason, such as ill health. All are expected to stay 
at the seminary and to continue to study regularly every day, although their freedom 
is greater than in the school season. 
The priests produced from the Rizareion are destined for the higher ecclesiastical 
positions. Greece is not able to assume the expense of educating all of her clergy so 
sumptuously. For the simpler education of other candidates for the priesthood, the 
Government established in 1856 three other ecclesiastical schools (Iepatcxat SyoAai), 
one in Syros, one in Chalkis, and one in Tripolis. 
The Catholics of Greece educate their clergy either in schools within Greece itself, 
especially in the islands, where most of the Catholics live, or in the theological 
schools of Rome and Paris. In Greece itself the Catholics have seminaries at Syros, 
Naxos, Tenos, and elsewhere. 
The Protestants in Greece educate their clergy abroad, chiefly in America.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. 331 
SCHOOLS FOR NEEDY BoyYs.! 
  In Greece, as elsewhere, there are many young boys that on account of having to 
earn their own living, or even to support some one else—a mother, a blind father, or 
a sister—have no time to attend aday school. In the larger cities provision has been 
made for these unfortunates. Night schools have been established for their special 
benefit in Athens, Patras, Kalamata, Zakynthos, and other cities. The Syllogos 
Parnassos can count among its noble works the practical aid it has given to these 
schools. 
Since Athens is the largest city of Greece, and since it is common for little waifs 
to come from all the provinces to Athens in order to find occupation, a school of this 
kind is more necessary in Athens than in the other larger cities. The school for 
needy boys in Athens is under the protection and direction of the Syllogos Parnassos. 
It is governed by a board of nine elected by the Syllogos from among its own mem- 
bers. This board appoints the teachers, and in general oversees the management of 
the school. Text-books and writing material are furnished free to the pupils. 
In 1891-92 this school gave instruction to 1,233 pupils, of whom 146 were Athe- 
nians, 264 from Megalopolis, 156 from Korinth, and 137 from Makedonia in Turkey. 
According to the regulations of the school, no pupils are admitted younger than 
5 years, nor older than 20. In this same year, however, by special permission, a few 
were allowed to enjoy the privileges of the school although older than 20 years. 
The following table shows the age of the pupils for that year:

      Carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, etc., were represented also. 
These night schools can not be classed with any other schools of the Kingdom, 
Such branches are taught as may be of most practical assistance to these working 
boys, namely: Religion, Greek language, mathematics (chiefly arithmetic), Greek 
history, geography, natural history, writing, and vocal music. 
The full course of instruction extends over a period of five years. Instruction is 
given every week-day evening for two and a half hours. Attendance in these schools 
ean not be regular. In the year 1891-92, 1,233 pupils were enrolled, but the aver- 
age daily attendance was 381. Of course it must be remembered that not all of 
the enrollments took place at the beginning of the year, in October, but extended 
throughout the entire year, at least up to the beginning of May. 
At the end of the year mentioned, 269 boys presented themselves for examinations, 
either to be promoted to a higher class or to receive a testimonial that they had 
completed the course. Eleven received such testimonials, six with the grade of 
dpiora. 
On two Sundays of each month the pupils attend church in a body, led by some 
of the older pupils. Twice a year the director of the school takes care that all go

to the sacrament of confession, The health of the pupils is also cared for. They 
receive free treatment from two physicians appointed from among the members of 
the syllogos. They also receive free all medicines that these physicians prescribe. 
SOCIETIES ESTABLISHED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES,! 
  Many are the societies (‘Hraipeiar, SbAAoyor, Aéoyac) established for the purpose of 
advancing education. The Greek is by nature a social character, and is ready to 
join clubs or societies for all kinds of purposes. Some of the more prominent 
educational societies in Athens are: 
The Parnassos, ‘0 @cAohoyindg BtAAoyog Mapvaccébc. 
The Byron, ‘0 LbAAoyor Bipwr. 
The Archzological Society, ‘H ’Apyatodoyixy ‘Eracpia.

The Koraes, '0 Kopaye. 
The idexradevrixy Erapia was founded through the efforts of Ioannes Kokkones, 
Georgios Gennadios, and Misael Apostolides. (See 'H Ievryxovraerypuc tis biAeKradev- 
tuxije ‘Erarpiag év 'ABhvatc in the '‘Horepoc for November 13, 1886. See, also, Ocopoddyzov, 
I, pp. 122, 123.) It is governed by a constitution formulated in 1836 and remodeled in 
1882. It has for its object the advancement of the people by education and culture. 
It pays especial attention to the education of girls. 
It has established young ladies’ academies and other schools; has defrayed the 
expenses of worthy students, especially girls; it has given prizes for best editions of 
text-books and other books useful for the purposes of education; it has borne the 
expense of publishing such books; it has supplied needy schools with apparatus, etc. 
Thesociety does all this by means of funds made up from the annual fees of members 
(18 drachmas a year) and the gifts of benefactors and others, the income from the 
property it owns, the initiation fees of members (6 drachmas), etc. 
The Musical and Dramatical Society aims at the founding and sustaining of a 
national theater. The society was founded in 1871. It interests itself in the work 
done in the Odeion. The society is yet far from attaining its purpose, yet it will 
finally bring good results. The theater has always been a favorite institution with 
the Greeks. And the restoration of the Greek theater to the high rank that it 
deserves is justly one of the aspirations of the cultivated Hellenes of to-day. It 
will not be uninteresting to add a short account of the first attempt to produce 
a Greek play in Athens since the acquisition of freedom. (See the ArAavric for 
December 19, 1896.) Ever since the gaining of freedom the Athenians had enjoyed 
the pleasures of a theater, but the dramas produced were foreign affairs, in Italian

  was Alexandros Rizos Rangabes. In 1853, Rangabes, already known as professor, 
scholar, writer, diplomat, soldier, wrote a drama called the Vigil, 'H Iapapovy. He 
determined to have it produced on the stage. There were no professional actors in 
Athens, so he had to engage the kind services of amateurs. Rehearsals began, and 
all Athens was impatient for the proud event of seeing a realGreek play. The play 
was to be given in the theater of Boukoura, and the proceeds were to be spent in 
buying clothing for the Greek soldiers in Peta. However, in the play there were 
certain passages referring to the action of Austria against the first proclaimers of 
the struggle for liberty. These passages displeased the Austrian ambassador, who 
announced that if the play were produced he would immediately depart from Athens, 
Rangabes then cut out the offensive passages, and after a long delay he received 
permission to proceed.’ King Otho and Queen Amelia were to be present at the per- 
formance, but on the morning of the evening on which the play was to be given 
there came a message to Athens that the Greek garrison at Peta had been attacked 
by the Turks and fallen in slaughter. So great was the gloom that spread over 
Athens that no one thought of the play, and the Vigil was never produced. 
But, nevertheless, other Greeks, and Rangabes himself, soon had the satisfaction 
of seeing their Greek plays produced in Athens. 
Popular dramas at present are Oi MvAwvddec, The Millers, a comedy; 'H Karapa rig 
Mdvac, The Mother’s Curse; 'H Mijdeva, 'H aiara, tragedies. 
Old classic dramas, such as the Oedipous Tyrannos, The Philoktetes, the Antigone, 
are produced from time to time. 
The Society of the Friends of the People ('H 'Eraspia rév bitwr toi Aaod) seeks by 
means of public and popular courses of lectures to instil useful and entertaining 
knowledge of a patriotic and elevating kind into the hearts of the workingmen. 
These lectures are given in the evening, when such menare free. Each year’s course 
consists of about 125 lectures. The lectures are arranged in groups, each group 
forming a connected series of instruction. Popular topics are the history of Greece, 
and instruction in the natural sciences. Some of the best teachers of Athens find 
time to belong to this association, and lend their aid to the cause of educating the 
working classes. 
THE HISTORICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 
(H Ioropuxy cat EOvodoyixh “Eracpia.) 
The Historical and Ethnological Society was founded in 1882. In the following 
year it began to publish a valuable periodical containing the results of its researches, 
In the prologue to the first number Mr. Timoleon Philemon, the first president of the 
society, explains the reason why the society came into existence, and the necessity 
of its continuing to exist. The object of the society is to study theelife of the Greeks 
from the time when they ceased to be an independent people down to the time when 
they again regained their freedom. The society in its studies excludes no phase of 
life whatsoever. Art, literature, morals, social relations, superstitions, religion, 
politics, customs, etc., are all to be searched for in order to discover the true history 
of the people, and to show scientifically the exact relation of the present Greeks to 
those of all the past. 
‘The society possesses a museum, in which it keeps all such relics and mementos of 
the ages covered by the studies of the society as it succeeds in collecting. This col- 
lection includes garments of men and women, medals, coins, seals, musical instru- 
ments, manuscripts, books, letters, bulls, ete. 
THE ARCHZOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 
(H 'Apxatodoyixd, “Eratpia.) 
The Archwological Society was founded in 1837 through the zeal and determina- 
tion of Kyriakos S. Pittakes and Alexandros Rizos Rangabes. With limited means 
at its disposal this society has accomplished wonders. Excavations have been scien-
-P-A-G-E-414

tifically and successfully carried on at many different places, notably at Athens (on 
the Akropolis), Elevsis, Epidavros, Tanagra, Mykene, Lykosoura, Sparta, and 
Rhamnous. 
Since its foundation the society has published the ‘Ap yavo2oyux) Edquepic as its organ. 
The society twice almost ceased to exist on account of lack of funds, and accordingly 
the publication of the journal was twice interrupted. It isnow published quarterly 
in splendid style and with scientific accuracy. Beside the Ephemeris, the society 
also publishes its Ipaxrxd from time to time, in which the reports of the various 
officials of the society make known the progress of the work done under their special 
charge. 
THE SOCIETY FOR CHRISTIAN ARCHAOLOGY. 
This society was founded to supplement. the work of the excellent Archzological 
Society; for the Archeological Society, completely wrapped up in the study of the 
older monuments, not only found no time to devote to the remains of later times, 
but even often showed positive neglect or even contempt for the monuments of 
medixval Christianity, monuments which have an absolute value in the history and 
fate of the Greek people. Often, in order to facilitate research for classic finds, 
Christian monuments were unnecessarily sacrificed. To correct this abuse the 
Society of Christian Archeology was founded and has its place. The society has 
much work before it. It intends to study and care for edifices of Byzantine archi- 
tecture, mosaics, inscriptions, frescos, coins, medals, manuscripts, etc. As yet, how- 
ever, through lack of means, this society has done comparatively little, compared 
with its older classic sister, the ‘ApyatoAoyr«) ‘Etaipia. The Marquis of Bute has been 
one of its mast devoted friends. 
FOREIGN ARCHEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS IN ATHENS. 
These schools really do not need to be mentioned here, as being outside of the 
system of schools intended primarily for Greeks. They are supported from abroad, 
are conducted by foreigners, were established by foreigners, and are intended for 
foreigners. Yet their work is so excellent, and is so much in line and in sympathy 
with the work of the Greek archwological societies and is open in a certain way 
to Greeks, at least as regards use of libraries and other collections, that they should 
not be left unmentioned eyen here. 
There are now four such schools in Athens, The French and German schools are 
supported by their respective Governments; the British school receives partial 
support from the Government; the American school is supported entirely by the 
Archeological Institution of America and by private contributions. 
These schools are simply groups of young investigators under the guidance of 
older specialists. 
  THE FRENCH INSTITUTE. 
The French school was founded in 1846 under the title of the Ecole Frangaise 
@Athenes, Since 1876 it is known as the Institut de Correspondance Hellénique. 
The school devotes itself chiefly to archwological studies. It has carried on exca- 
vations with eminent success at various places—e. g., at Delos. At present the 
French school is conducting excavations at Deiphi. The work is being done with 
characteristic thoroughness, Here it-is that the fragments of hymns to Apollo, 
with ancient musical notation, were discoyered. In 1890 the French Government 
appropriated 500,000 francs for the inaugurating and carrying on of these exca- 
vations. 
The school is under the guidance of a director appointed by the Government. He 
directs the work of the school as a whole and also gives advice and assistance to 
the individual members. The members are six in number. No one is eligible for

membership unless he be a professor extraordinary in the Academy. Each member 
remains at Athens for a term of three years. Some of the best French Hellenists, 
philologians as well as archwologists, have been members of this school. 
Up to the year 1877 the work of the school and its results were made known 
through different periodicals, especially the Revue Archéologique. But since that 
year the school has published a monthly periodical of its own, the Bulletin de Cor- 
respondance Hellénique. To this publication there has been added, since 1881, the 
Bibliothdque des Ecoles d@’Athines et de Rome. 
THE GERMAN ARCHZOLOGICAL INSTITUTE,! 
The German Archeological Institute at Athens was modeled after its elder sister, 
the institute at Rome. In 1874 the Roman school, then known as the Royal Prus- 
sian Archeological Institute, was changed into the Imperial German Archxological 
Institute, and in this same year a branch school was established in Athens. The 
branch, however, grew so rapidly in importance that in 1887 it was raised to equal 
rank with the institute at Rome, and since that year is known as the Athenische 
Abtheilung des Kaiserlich Deutschen Archxologischen Instituts. 
The institute is now located in a fine edifice built by Schliemann expressly for 
the purpose. It is under the management of two secretaries. These are now Prof. 
Wilhelm Dérpfeld and Dr. Paul Wolters. Five stipendiaries are kept in the insti- 
tute at Athens. To be eligible as stipendiary one must have already received the 
doctorate. 
The library of the institute, an excellent one for archeological work, took its 
beginning from the books collected by Arthur von Velsen, who died in Athens in 
1861 as secretary of the Prussian embassy. 
The magnificent work of the institute is evident in its publication, the Mitthei- 
lungen des Kaiserlich Deutschen Archzologischen Instituts, Athenische Abtheilung. 
The publication was begun in 1876, and appears as a quarterly. The language of 
the publication is mostly German. Occasionally, however, an article contributed 
by some one of other nationality appears in the writer’s own vernacular, e. g., 
Greek or English, 
THE BRITISH SCHOOL. 
This school was founded in 1886. It has been supported by the universities of 
Cambridge and Oxford and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. The 
Government now contributes something toward the maintenance of the school. Its 
chief organ is the Journal of Hellenic Studies. 
The school is under the direction of a committee, which meets in London, consist- 
ing of Hellenists and art lovers. In Athens the management is in the hands ofa 
director. 
The library of the school is a very good one. 
Successful excavations have been carried on by the school at different places in 
Greece and also in the island of Kypros. 
THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL STUDIES. 
Of all these archeological schools at Athens the American School of Classical 
Studies is dearest to us. From the following account it will be seen that its work 
has been such as to make us feel proud of it and its projectors and managers. 
It was founded by the Archxological Institute of America, and is under control

of that institution. Soon after the founding of the Archeological Institute, in 
1879, its members began to feel that on account of the peculiar importance of mak- 
ing research in the old classic lands special measures should be taken to perma- 
nently establish some means of carrying out such investigations. The land thus 
first favored was Greece. 
Through the cooperation of nine of the first colleges of America, each of which 
promised to contribute $250 annually for ten years, the school at Athens-was estab- 
lished, and in the autumn of 1882 Mr. W. W. Goodwin, professor of Greek at Har- 
vard University, went to Athens as the first director of the new school. 
The founders of the school did not limit its scope to archwology, foreseeing that, 
although most of the best work done would be in archeology, yet many a young 
college graduate might profit much by a year’s philological or historical training 
there in the very center of old Hellenic life. 
After a few years of existence the school became prosperous enough to warrant 
the erection of a house adapted to the needs of the school. The Greek Government, 
with characteristic generosity, donated the grounds, and in 1888 the fine new build- 
ing was ready for occupation. 
Since that time American archeological or classical students and scholars visiting 
Athens have found at the foot of the southeast slope of Lykabettos an institution 
that they may take just pride in. They find there an excellent library, adapted 
especially for the study of the art, topography, epigraphy, language, and literature 
of Ancient Greece. They find a small knot of young, enthusiastic men, who find 
highest delight in delving, now by book and now by spade, into the marvelous life 
of that people which has been the civilizers of the world. 
The school sends out two sets of publications—the Annual Reports and the Papers 
of the American School of Classical Studies. The American Journal of Archeology 
and of the Fine Arts also publishes much of the work of the school. 
The management of the school was, during the first six years of its existence, in 
the hands of a director sent out annually from one of the cooperating colleges. Now, 
however, the director is appointed for a period of five years. The present director, 
Prof. Rufus B. Richardson, whose term of five years would have expired this year, 
has been reappointed. Thus the school falls under the direction of aman who, by 
continuous residence in Greece and by unbroken application to scientific work there, 
will bring about the best results that are possible. Beside the director there are 
two other officers, a professor of literature and a secretary. These are appointed 
annually. The professor of literature for the year beginning October, 1897, is Pro- 
fessor Emerson, of Cornell. 
Membership in the school is granted to graduates of cooperating colleges and to 
all other American students that are deemed to be sufficiently prepared for the work 
done in the school. 
The Americans have made important excavations at Sikyon, Thorikos, Ikaria in 
Attika, at the Heraecon near Argos, at Eretria in Evboea, and elsewhere. 
GREEK SCHOOLS OUTSIDE OF GREECE.! 
Greek schools outside of the Greek Kingdom have been made to conform as nearly 
as possible with the schools within the Kingdom, so that in the Turkish Empire, for 
instance, we find Greek demotic and Hellenic schools and gymnasia of the same rank 
as those of Greece. Many of these schools are older than the war of independence. 
The teachers in these schools of Grecia Irredenta have most of them studied at 
Athens, whither they are sent at the expense of communities, or as beneficiaries of 
scholarships established by patriot Greeks. Young Greeks of Turkey, also, study in 
the universities of Europe, supported by such scholarships. 
Just as in free Greece attention is being paid to the education of girls, so also in 
the Greek communities of Turkey is the same being done. Young ladies’ academies,

WRITERS ON PEDAGOGY. 
Although few scholars among the modern Greeks have devoted their time exclu- 
sively to a study of pedagogics, yet not a little work has been done in this science. 
In the year 1820 a well-known and successful scholarch, K. Koumas, who taught in 
Smyrna, published at the end of his work on philosophy a theoretical treatise on 
pedagogy. 
Adamantios Koraes, about whom more will be said in the chapter on the language 
question, never taught in any kind of school, and yet he must be regarded as know- 
ing well the theory of teaching. His views on pedagogy are scattered throughout 
his various writings. He strongly advocated the introduction of European methods 
into the schools of the East, and at different times used his influence in trying to 
induce wealthy Greeks to send young men to Switzerland and other places in order 
to learn the new educational systems that at that time were being much talked about. 
The first practical book on pedagogics published in free Greece was the ‘Odnyé¢ 
of Kokkones. This ‘Odjyéc, or Teachers’ Guide, was merely a translation from the 
French. It has several times been revised and republished, and has never ceased te 
be one of the best known books to every teacher in Greece. 
In 1839 a journal called ‘O Ma:daywyd¢ began to appear. It was intended chiefly 
for teachers, and contained, with other matter, a good amount of valuable pedagog- 
ical material. After a short time, however, the journal ceased to exist. 
In 1857 there appeared another work that can lay claim to being classed with 
pedagogical literature. This was the ‘Odnyé¢ tév doirntov, or Students’ Guide, by 
Professor Rousopoulos, of the university. It contains exhortations to scientifie 
education, a scientific method of studying, and the laws of the university. 
In 1865 G. G. Papadopoulos published a Practical Guide for Teachers in the 
Demotic Schools, Aoxiwiov Mpaxtixav ‘Odnyiav mpd¢ trode AdackddAove tov Anuotinor 
  Zyoteiov. év APjvace. 
In 1878 the Acdackatixde LiAAoyoc, an organized society of teachers, began to pub- 
lish a pedagogical journal called drwy. It was continued until 1890, appearing 
once a month during that time. The intention of the society in publishing and 
supporting this journal was to better the condition of teachers in the preparatory 
and middle schools, and to better the schools themselves by diffusing among the 
teachers a more scientific knowledge of the methods of teaching. Among the many 
good articles that appeared in this journal, I make especial mention of a series of 
articles written by Mr. Blasios G. Skordeles, entitled Hyepo2dyiov AnpuodiWacxddov, 
Hrot } MaWayuyia tv rH Wpdte, “A Teacher’s Diary, or Pedagogy in Practice.” Mr. 
Skordeles, in this diary, shows how a teacher may meet and solve the various per- 
plexing problems he meets with in the performance of his daily routine of duty. 
The diary has been also published in book form. 
During the last few years a periodical has been published, called 'H AvdmAaow tov 
Maidov, Training of Children. It treats in a practical way of many questions con- 
nected with elementary education. 
Another important book is by S. M. Olympios, treating of how to teach children 
to express their ideas both orally and in writing. A second edition of this excellent 
work came out in 1886 (cf. Eédoud¢ for August 10, 1886, p. 30). The title of the 
book is ‘Eyyerpidiov Mpodoptxdy nat Tpanrov "ExOécewv 'WdeGv' ind B. M. ‘O2vuriov, mpog

The Herbartian system has found a warm advocate in Mr. M. Bratsanos. He has 
written a Theoretical and Practical Guide for Demotic Schools according to Herbar- 
tian Priciples, Oewpyrindc al Npaxrinds Odnyds tov Anotixod Syodelov card tas apyac tov

tijs Méons Exradevoeac. ev Afivacc, 1889. Professor Pantazides has taught this science 
for years in the university. 
A proof of how seriously interested the Greeks are in the various theories of edu- 
cation is shown by the fact that, although money is very scarce with them, they never- 
theless from time to time attempt to devise some means of sending young men to 
Europe to make special study of pedagogics. Prizes are also given for best treatises 
on pedagogical subjects. For instance, in 1883 a prize of 2,000 drachmas, the 
Mapdevos ayov, was offered for the best work on this subject. (See TAdrwv, vol. 1v, 
pp. 106, 107.) 
TEXT-BOOKS, 
Before a text-book may be introduced into the schools it must be approved of by 
a committee appointed for that purpose by the minister of education. This com- 
mittee decides upon the suitableness of all text-books, and also determines the maxi- 
mum price at which the book isto besold, The law excluding all unapproved books 
is from November 24, 1867. Article 8 of that law states that every teacher in a pub- 
lie school who violates this law will be subject to a fine of from 50 to 150 drachmas, 
and must refund to the pupils all money that they may have spent at his advice for 
unapproved books. In case of a second offense he is dismissed. A teacher in a pri- 
vate school, if guilty of the same offense, loses for one year his license to teach. 
(See Oecpo26y:ov, 11, p. 197, note.) 
Certain books, such as the original texts of Greek and Latin classic authors, are 
not subject to this regulation. No text-book for religious instruction is admitted 
to competition unless it bear the approval of the holy synod. 
Every four years books are submitted for approval. Only one book of each kind 
is approved. The approval of a new book cancels the prévious approval of other 
books. 
Just as the system of schools is an imitation of the European system, so also is it 
common for European text-books to serve as models for the text-books used in Greek 
schools. This has naturally led to the mere translation of many European text- 
books into Greck. The period of mere translation, however, is fortunately passing 
away for most sciences, and the home produets are found to be, if not always quite 
so modern in scientific qualities, at least better adapted to circumstances, 
EDUCATION FREE, 
  The democratic principles of the Greeks make them averse to all favors that might 
be exclusively available to a special class of citizens. This principle makes them 
object to having any part of education purchasable by those only who have means. 
They think that no one should be debarred from any school, even the university, by 
being unable to pay for his tuition, and this the more so since the Greeks look on 
education as haying a ‘‘national” purpose. In his view, education of the Greeks 
advances the cause of Hellenism. Accordingly no Greek should be barred out from 
this field by poverty; and all education, from the lowest class in the demotic school 
up to the highest in the university and the polytechneion, is, by the popular inter- 
pretation of the constitution, to be given free of cost. 
However, during these last years, debt has pressed so heavily on the brave little 
Kingdom that it has been found necessary to raise taxes even from schools. Andin 
virtue of a law of 1892 (véuoc BND of that year), each student pays a tax by writing 
out his application for matriculation, etc., on stamped paper, so that now the stu- 
dent of the Hellenic school pays about 25, the student of the gymnasium 50, and the 
university student 100 to 150 drachmas a year. This tax has met with opposition, 
especially from the students of the university, on the ground that it is unconstitu- 
tional.

EDUCATION IN GREECE. ‘B39 
THE PRINTING PRESS IN GREECE. 
After the summary disposal of the printing establishment set up in Constanti- 
nopol by Kyrillos Loukaris we hear of no other attempt to print anything among 
the Greeks of the Empire until the year 1820. In that year Firmin Didot, who had 
returned to Paris enchanted with what he had learned about the Greeks during his 
stay in Kydonia and other parts of the East, sent two printing presses, with type 
and other necessaries, one to the school at Kydonia, which he loved so intensely, and 
the other to the town of Chios. Chios received-this gift through the influence of 
Koraes, who was at that time in Paris and was an intimate friend of Didot. The 
busy Greeks immediately began to issue pamphlets and booklets from both of these 
presses, but their joy was short-lived. The Turks destroyed the press at Kydonia 
in the year 1821, when they burned the village; they destroyed the one at Chios in 
1822, when they perpetrated their awful butcheries of that year. (For a description 
of these massacres read Loukis Laras, by Demetrios Bikelas.) 
During the war of liberation presses were set up at various places, notably at 
Missolonghi, at Navplion, etc. Journals and not books were printed from these 
presses. 
The first books printed in Athens came from the press of Andreas Koromelas, who 
had gone to Paris, and there in the establishment of Firmin Didot learned the busi- 
ness of printing. He came back to Athens, and in the year 1835 established a print- 
ing house. Letters in Greece owe much to him. : 
JOURNALISM IN GREE 
  Journalism is so closely connected with modern culture and education that it is 
impossible to omit it from the present treatise. So a brief sketch of Greek journal- 
ism from its first beginnings down to the present day will not be out of place. (See 
La Presse dans la Gréce Moderne depuis l’indépendance jusqu’en 1871, par le Marquis 
de Queux de Saint-Hilaire, in the Annuaire des Htudes Grecques, 1871, pp. 147 ff. See 
also To Iwbedaiov rio Auadbeiac, in the E6dopzdc for July 30, 1888.) 
After the fallof Venice, in 1797, Vienna became the literary center of learned Greeks 
in Europe. Here it was that the first Greek journal made its appearance. It began 
in 1793, being edited by the brothers Pouliou. It did not last long. The last num- 
ber appeared on June 28, of the same year. 
In 1811 another Greek paper was started in Vienna, the Bidjoen Oia Ta AvatohiKd 
Mépn, or News for Eastern Parts, which was followed in the next year by the EAAnuKic 
Tnréypagoc. These short-lived attempts were overshadowed in importance by theschol- 
arly and influential Aéyvo¢s ‘Epujc, begun in 1811 by Anthimos Gazes. It continued to 
exist and do good until the very eve of the war for independence, which it did much to 
bring about. It ceased in 1821. 
Paris also at this time was the rendezvous of a number of learned Greeks. Long 
is the list of Greek journals that came into brief existence in Paris. The A§mva was 
founded in 1818, the Movoaiov in 1819, and the MéAiooa in the same year. 
After Greece became free the chief raison d’étre of the editing of Greek papers in 
foreign countries passed away. However, other reasons arose making it important 
that some such papers continue to exist. Accordingly, since that time Greek journals 
and periodicals have been published for longer or shorter periods in various places 
of Europe. In Paris we find the [oA roc and the Mipia "Oca, in 1868, and the 'E9vixy 
"Exedpyoir in 1869. ‘ In Great Britain was published the Bperravixds Aoryp, by 
Stephanos Xenos; in Leipzig the, Ke, and in Triest the Néa Hyépa. This last 
paper was founded in 1855. It still flourishes as a weekly under the masterful edi- 
torship of the scholar and litterateur, Alexandros Byzantios. 
Eyen in Turkey the Greeks were finally allowed to have their newspapers. Per- 
haps the first such was the '‘O9ouavcKd¢ Myvitwp of Constantinopol. In 1838, Constan- 
tine Rhodes, a warm Philhellene, established at Smyrna the Aya/9e.a, which still 
exists and does good.

    340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Within the territory now occupied by free Greece the first paper published was 
the Aorv«?, which began in Keryka in the year 1802. It was short-lived. 
While Missolonghi was being besieged by the Turks, the first paper printed under 
what may be called free Greek government made its appearance. It was edited by 
the Swiss Philhellene Mayer under the title of Xpovixd EAAnvixd. It was championed 
and supported by Stanhope, who had come from England to Greece for the express 
purpose of starting newspapers, schools, etc. The Xpovica began to appear in Janu- 
ary of 1824. Itwasa biweekly. It is now valuable for a source of information for 
facts concerning the war, and on this account has been reprinted. It was in this 
paper that Trikoupes’s famous funeral discourse over the remains of Lord Byron was 
published. 
Before the appearance of the Xpovix«d of Missolonghi, matter had been printed in 
Greece, but no newspaper seems to have been published. Prior to this time there 
was a press at Kalamata under the control of Ypsilantis, and another at Korinth, 
used for the printing of proclamations, etc. (See Stanhope’s letter XVII in work 
cited above.) 
Later in the same year,1824, another paper came out in Greece, the ’iAo¢ rod Noov, 
published at Hydra. The editor was an Italian named Chiappa. Chiappa’s outfit 
consisted of not much more than a small quantity of tpye. He printed the paper 
by inking the type by hand, and then taking the impression as printers take proof 
impressions. He was writer, editor, typesetter, proof reader, pressman—all. 
In 1825 the Tevix? Egnuepis tic EAAddoc was begun as the organ of the Government, 
At least it was the organ of Kapodistrias. Since 1835 the Edgnpepic ric Kubepvicews 
has been the official organ of the Government. During the reign of Otho it was 
accompanied by an official edition in German for the numerous Bavarians in Otho’s 
service. 
From the small beginnings described above the press in Greece grew with marvel- 
ous rapidity. In the year 1867 Greece sent to the World’s Exposition a copy of all the 
papers published in the country. They were almost a hundred in number. Since 
that time the number has gone on constantly increasing. At present newspapers 
are published not only in Athens, Patras, Peireeus, and other large cities, but almost 
every town of any consequence has its paper, at least a weekly. These papers are 
small in size, but not in aspirations. 
In Athens the prineipal papers to-day are the Egzyepic, the Axpérodic, the Néa Egnye- 
pis, the Matvyyevecia, the Mpwia, and the Neodsyo¢ Kovorartwourédews. This last paper 
was until recently published in Constantinopol. But as a result of the late war tho 
editor, 8. I. Boutyras, thought that the proper place for a journal that wished to 
express its thoughts freely was not in the city of the Crescent. 
Greece has also a number of periodicals. Among the best are the Mapvacodc, which 
is the organ of the Parnassus Club, and the A§jva. The various sciences are repre- 
sented by some special periodicals. 
ILLITERACY AMONG THE MASSES.! 
The modern Greek, like his classic ancestors, is by nature a searcher and inquirer. 
He is social, and likes to dispute and discuss. He does not resort to books for 
knowledge or entertainment as frequently as do the colder men of northern climes. 
It follows that the average Greek is not such a devourer of written knowledge as 
we would like to have him be. The percentage of downright illiteracy is perhaps 
greater than one would wish to see. Yet it is among the older men and among the 
women that illiteracy chiefly prevails. The older men are to be excused, because 
when they were boys Greece was still very young and had not yet developed her 
system of schools. The women owe their illiteracy to the fact that custom rele- 
pa them to household gauss and for Hugs seg oto; in Greece book Enowjedge

  has not been in demand. We see in another chapter how the women of Greece are 
now beginning to vindicate their intellectual qualities in the field of higher edu- 
cation, as they vindicated themselves long ago in patriotic courage, Among the 
younger women the percentage of illiteracy is greater than among the younger men. 
Of: the younger men indeed very few are unable to read. According to the statis- 
tics of 1885, two-thirds of the entire population were yet unable to read. 
Since the Greek is a politician by nature, he loves to read political news more than 
any other kind. This explains the extraordinary number of daily journals pub- 
lished in the Kingdom. Light literature is read chiefly by the ladies. They like 
the European novels, which are translated for them in abundance. When the man 
reads a novel, he prefers one whose plot is connected with the history and traditions 
of hisown country. The modern writers of light literature in Greece are sufficiently 
numerous, and have produced many a readable book. 
THE LANGUAGE QUESTION. 
The question of education in.Greece can not be completely handled without 
devoting a chapter to their language. This might be true of education in any 
country, but it is especially true for Greece. In Greece, as in every country that 
possesses a literature, there exists a difference between the literary language and 
the spoken language. Again, every language spoken throughout extensive terri- 
tory has a number of local varieties or dialects, and every literary language has a 
variety of forms, according as the writer uses a language more or less different 
from the spoken dialects. 
In Greece there exists a clique of scholars who ery out that the literary language 
should be identical with the spoken. One of the prominent men of this school at 
present is Professor Psycharis, teacher of Greek in Paris. Psycharis is a scholar of 
note. He has written a number of excellent treatises dealing with the language 
question; but what attracted most attention was his book, To Tagids yov. He 
wrote it in what he regards as the correct language for a literary work. The book 
produces the same impression on a modern Greek as it would on an American if done 
into such English as would be a mixture of Louisiana plantation dialect with the 
language of the slums of New York enriched by stray words and phrases of New 
England Yankee dialect and vigorous phrases of the western cowboy together with 
a large amount of other slang from all parts of the English-speaking world. But 
not all the advocates of the “‘people’s language” are as extreme as is Psycharis. 
The followers of the opposite school write in a simplified and modernized form of 
the old Hellenic or Kow7. This is the traditional literary language with such as 
have not sought to write in some form of ancient Greek. The writers of this lan- 
guage are not disturbed by the fact that there is a difference between their language 
and that of the illiterate. Many of them know German and English and Italian, 
and they see that in these languages there exists a like difference, and as great. 
Nearly all scientific books, text-books, journals, etc., are published in the language 
of these purists. Some poets, novelists, and other such writers often use the 
demotic for the same good reasons that poets and novelists do in other countries. 
But in Greece the evil is that these poets and novelists sometimes think that every 
good Greek should learn to speak their dialect. 
The language of the purists, the Katharevousa, as it is called, is not of one rigid 
kind merely, but possesses many varieties from the Attic accuracy of a Kontos, the 
suppler grace of a Lampros, or a Paganelles, down to the looseness of a Rhoides. Of 
these varieties, however, each heartily condemns all the others. The writers men- 
tioned here are all writers of prose. The same variety of language, however, exists 
among the poets that write in Katharevousa. 
As early as the fifteenth century the dispute over what ought to be the literary 
language of the Greeks began. The difference between the literary and the spoken 
language had been growing greater century after century. because the writers per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
    342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
sisted in trying to write in ancient Greek. We all know that-as soon as a country 
has a literature behind it worthy of study, just so soon is a difference created be- 
tween the language of literature and that of ordinary life. How far the language 
of ordinary life should mold that of literature, and how far the language of litera- 
ture should mold the language of ordinary life is a matter that depends on different 
circumstances. Of course to-day when the written page is so potent and universal 
a medium, and when every one is under the influence of the written word, itis clear 
that the written word will triumph over the spoken form in many cases where in 
other times the spoken word would have easily prevailed; but of course written 
learning will never keep free from influence from below. 
Well then, the ever widening breach between the written language and the spoken 
dialects became a matter of serious discussion in the fifteenth century. One of the 
first determined defenders of the value of the people’s language was the learned 
Nikolaos Sophianos, who flourished in the first half of the sixteenth century. He 
wrote a grammar of the common language, in the preface of which he says, address- 
ing the Cardinal John, Prince of Lorraine, ‘‘ Dum igitur hance nostram quam vocant 
vulgarem linguam cum illa antiquorum confero Platonis Demosthenis Xenophontis 
etaliorum * * * reperimultisinrebus hanc nostram vetere illaminimeinferiorem 
esse. Constat nempe verbis puris per manus (?) ab antiquissimo s:eculo traditis et 
brevitate quadam mirabili tum regulis certis et paucis.” 
This same Sophianos wrote or translated other works, using the common dialect. 
At that time the demotic found but few such determined admirers as was he. 
The growing determination of the Greeks to again become a free people had its 
influence on the language question. As a matter of fact, there existed no common 
and universal spoken language, if we except the language of the purists. The 
inhabitants of each separate valley had a peculiar way of speaking. But whenever 
one wrote something for all Greeks to read, what was to be done? Some believed 
that the classic language should be the common medium of communication among 
scholars; others preferred the ecclesiastical Greek; others more sensibly looked for 
some medium of communication that would be nearer to the language of the people. 
Those who wrote without knowing in what form they were writing, but followed 
their better thoughts, usually wrote in a form of the Katharevousa. 
Each opinion had its warm defenders. The strife among them grew bitter and 
personal. At the beginning of the present century we find, for example, Koraes (see 
*Adaudavrios Kopaie bxd Acovvciov Oepiavov) and his followers advocatiag that the writ- 
ten language be made up of such elements as are common to most of the dialects; 
that it be enriched not from other modern languages nor from local dialects of 
modern Greek but from the classic language, and that the classic language be used 
as a model as far as could be consistently done. 
Koraes was attacked from all sides, but yet he had a larger following than any of 
his opponents. He was too fond of the vulgar language to suit Panagiotes Kodrikas, 
and too much inclined to be influenced by the ancient to suit Daniel Philippides. 
Nor could he find favor with the good-dispositioned Neophytos Doukas, who wished 
the learned to write in the language of the church as used in official letters, etc., in 
the patriarchate of Constantinopol, and in the writings of the church fathers and in 
the sacred liturgy. 
But in the midst of this quarrelling the war for freedom broke out. It served as 
a cloak to smother the flames of dispute. Patriotism was stronger than love for 
intellectual polemics. But before the boom of war came Koraes had practically 
triumphed. He has since been regarded as the molder of the present Katharevousa. 
Certain writers or scribblers attribute their lack of success in producing master- 
pieces to the imperfection of the medium they are compelled to write in. These 
vehemently advocate a return to the language of the peasants. They are not suffi- 
ciently numerous or influential to do great harm, but still they can produce uneasiness 
by their boisterous complainings. Sometimes their attempts are amusing, when, for 
example, after writing a poem or story in their favorite lingo, they find it necessary
-P-A-G-E-423
    EDUCATION IN GREECE. 343 
to add annotations in order that the people may understand; and these annotations 
are always in the. Katharevousa. 
. The various dialects are in many respects very beautiful. These dialects tell the 
history of the people. They are replete with myth and tradition and history. 
Although no one of them is worthy of being made the literary language of the entire 
Greek people, yet each and every one of them has a high philological value. 
In order to.encourage the study of these dialects, prizes have been offered at differ- 
ent times for the best collections of words, phrases, stories, ballads, etc., from amoug 
the people. 
A few years ago a society called the Koraes was founded for the special purpose of 
encouraging research into the popular language. It published a periodical containing 
rich material for further study in this line. In Germany, Dr. Albert Thumb, of Frei- 
burg, is devoting himself to this study, and Professor Krumbacher, of Munich, who 
publishes the Byzantinische Zeitschrift, and has written a Geschichte der Byzantin- 
ischen Litteratur, from the fact that he makes a specialty of Byzantine matters, is 
naturally highly interested in the study of the modern dialects. 
Much has also been done in the same line by the Philologikos Syllogos of Con- 
stantinopol in encouraging the collecting of “Living Memories,” Zévra Mvyuecia of 
the various dialects, and publishing the same in its periodical the 'EAAnvinig biAohoyi- 
Kdg SbARyoe Tis Kovoravriwouré2ews. 
But the man who is now doing most for the proper study of these beautiful and 
attractive dialects is Dr. Georgios Hatzidakis, a Kretan. He is professor of com- 
parative philology in the university. After having distinguished himself as astudent 
in the Greek University, he went to Germany and studied comparative philology there. 
In his numerous writings, some of which are in Greek and others in German, he 
teaches that the only language that can possibly remain the universal language of 
Greece is the Katharevousa, but that the Katharevousa should be enriched not only 
from the ancient language, but also from the modern dialects, He strongly urges 
the serious study of the dialects in order that their true value may become known, 
and that they may be properly used for the enriching of the literary language. 
Hatzidakis is an admirer of Koraes, and was one of the charter members, if not 
the founder, of the Koraes Society mentioned above. Indeed it is mostly due to 
Koraes’s influence and correct advice that the Katharevousa has won its way and 
gained its place to stay. 
Koraes was born in Smyrna in 1748. From childhood up he hungered after letters. 
In his autobiography he tells of how his father, a poor man, encouraged his desire 
tostudy. If the young Koraes asked his father for a new garment, his father would 
hesitate, but whenever he asked for a new book, or for an instructor, his father imme- 
diately made provision. But nevertheless he was 34 years old before he could devote 
himself thoroughly to letters. Then he studied medicine at Montpellier. In 1788 
he went to Paris and began to write. His opinions on the language question aro 
scattered throughout his various writings, which a few years ago were published in 
anew and complete edition, Ta “Anavra rot Kopay. 
ATTIC GRAMMAR. 
It has already been stated that the practice still is to teach all the grammatical 
knowledge given to the students through the medium of the Attic grammar. This 
does not imply that the teachers expect to hear the pupils use in conversation or 
find them employing in writing all the forms peculiar to the Attic. They merely look 
on grammar as a science, and regard the Attic grammar as affording best material 
for the learning of that science. 
There are scholars, however, who hold that the Katharevousa should be taught 
directly through its own grammar. And, since 1884, the teaching of modern Greek 
grammar has been on the programmes of the gymnasia. Grammars of this kind have 
been prepared, but not by the most competent men. Most men of the first rank seem 
to think that such an innovation is not yet needed. Pantazides, however, thinks     
-P-A-G-E-424
344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
that such grammar should be the basis of the teaching in the schools, but is unable 
to say how far such grammars should depart from Atticism. Naturally, however, 
such grammars will gradually come to be universally approved. 
MODERN LANGUAGES. 
  No provision whatsoever is made for the teaching of the other modern languages, 
French, German, English, etc., in the university. The importance of the classical 
languages and literatures seems to so overshadow the usefulness of the later languages 
as to make them entirely neglected as objects of university study. The position of 
language teacher in a gymnasion does not demand that the incumbent be a philo- 
Jogian, and as a matter of fact such positions are often filled by Europeans who 
merely teach how to read and converse in these languages. No provision is made 
for teaching them in a philological way. The remunerative allurements that would 
cause a young Greek to study the philology of some other language instead of his 
native Greek philology, are very weak. 
The Greeks easily learn to converse in modern languages. Many men and women 
of moderate education speak French and Italian and German and English. This 
knowledge and facility is not due to any university training. Strangely enough the 
only modern languages, so far as I know, ever taught in the university were English 
and Turkish. English was taught by Professor Masson, who translated Winer’s 
Greek Grammar of the New Testament into English, but he did not teach long. 
After the Turkish language had been taught for a few years it was found that no 
one studied it philologically; and those who wished to learn to merely speak and 
write it could succeed better by taking their instruction from an ordinary teacher 
of languages.

[Nore.—Statistics for the Sunday schools of the United States are not entirely 
satisfactory in respect to accuracy, for reasons that will appear in this chapter. 
At the present time the International Sunday School Convention, meeting 
once in three years, is the most prominent agency for securing the statistics of 
enrollment in Sunday schools. Thelastsession was in June, 1896. In its reports, no 
date is given for the statistics, but they are presumably for the year ending with 
the meeting. The reports of the convention are mainly limited to ‘evangelical 
Sunday schools,” leaving the enrollment of several bodies sustaining Sunday 
schools to be sought in some other way. Many denominations publish the enroll- 
ment of their Sunday schools. Some use, apparently, the calendar year; others 
use a year ending with some month other than December. A part of the denomi- 
national year books for 1896 are much more definite regarding Sunday schools 
than the corresponding books for 1897. For the reasons above mentioned no 
better or later results are likely to be available before 1899. ] 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 
There is a risk in calling anything the first of its kind. Some one 
is very apt to be reminded of another still older. No man can tell 
when the first’ Sunday school was taught; but following back the 
inquiry along the lines of Christian teaching into those of Judaism, 
one will find himself transported to a remote past, with a possible

Sunday, or Sabbath, school still beyond him. It flatters our vanity to 
claim the Sunday school as a token of hardly more than a century’s 
progress, but that view requires us to ignore the works of earlier cen- 
turies and of other people. 
It has been deemed best in this report to present Sunday schools 
mainly as seen by others, especially by those prominent in the work, 
and to restrict comments of the compiler within narrow limits. This 
plan does not produce a statement of conditions as systematically 
arranged as could otherwise be prepared, but it enables a comparison 
to be made of many authorities whose value each reader can weigh 
in the light of his own knowledge and convictions. 
While the principal interest centers upon present schools, the his- 
tory of the use of a special day for weekly religious instruction of 
youth has such value as to suggest a chronological order. This 
would require a notice, first, of Jewish schools, then of Christian— 
that is, of Catholic, Moravian, Lutheran, Reformed, and the later 
ones that have grown out of them—with notice of such current move- 
ments as have marked peculiarities. In giving prominence to reports 
of the International Sunday School Convention the chronological 
order indicated above is disturbed. 
There is first a general sketch of Sunday schools, then a Lutheran 
view of Sunday schools, followed by a statement of the principles of 
education laid down by the great Moravian teacher, Comenius, as most 
completely expressing the convictions of reformers and the denomi- 
nations that trace their history to the reformers, after which follow 
certain other groups whose returns are available, with any special 
peculiarities they may present, summed up in the international 
report. After the international report are noticed the Catholic, the 
Hebrew, the Unitarian, and the Latter-Day Saints schools, followed 
by a summary and a note explaining the imperfection of returns. 
The Lutheran extracts touch upon early history and fill out some 
omissions in the opening statement which could not well be put in 
their chronological order without sacrificing the unity of a citation 
or duplicating matter. The Protestant Episcopalian makes great use 
of church catechisms. The International Sunday School Conventions 
embrace denominations with a general similarity of practice in their 
Sunday schools. The Friend and the Unitarian reach over the lines 
of Biblical texts to a range of topics limited only by human welfare, 
as most fully shown in the statement of Friends Schools in England, 
by John William Graham. The work of the present Hebrew con- 
tinues that of his devout ancestor. The earnestness of Roman Catho- 
lic instruction is suggestive. The fullness with which the Latter- 
Day Saints, youngest among great religious bodies, have adopted 
systematic methods of instruction will indicate a source of their 
power to those who advocate other views. 
In attempting to treat of the Sunday schools of the United States

with impartial fairness one can not include or exclude schools, sects, 
or denominations upon the basis of his sympathy with their forms of 
doctrine. All here included, however, accept at least the Old Testa- 
ment Scriptures, all recognize the same God, and all use the same day 
as a day of special religious instruction. 
  GENERAL SKETCH OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The Sunday school is prominent among popular educational agen- 
cies. So popular, indeed, has it become that we are in constant danger 
of forgetting the work for which it is presumed to exist in the promi- 
nence given it as an organization, exalting the machinery above the 
product, the means above the end. 
The following quotation expresses a general conviction as to reli- 
gious instruction: 
Mankind has not lived for so many centuries on this little planet without arriv- 
ing at some safe conclusions. One certainly is that the great forces of human 
character can not be properly guided without training and intellectual equipment. 
This great principle, if granted, includes certain lesser truths, one of which is 
that moral and religious education are just as needful as intellectual train- 
ing. Some of us would say that ethical and spiritual development are of first 
importance.! 
Friedrich Froebel, the apostle of the Kindergarten (1782-1852), said: 
Every human being, as a being proceeding from God, existing through God, and 
living in God, should raise himself to the Christian religion—the religion of Jesus. 
Therefore the school should first of all teach the religion of Christ; therefore it 
should first of all, and above all, give instruction in the Christian religion; every- 
where, and in all zones, the school should instruct for and in this religion. ? 
The following extract from the laws of Delaware seems unique for 
this country, in making an appropriation from public funds for Sun- 
day schools: ® 
Chapter XLI.—Of Sabbath schools. 
Srotron 1. The levy court of each county is required to pay annually, by orders 
on the county treasurer, to the teachers of each Sabbath school kept therein for 
three months or more in the year fifty cents for each white scholar, upon the 
report of such teachers, or of the superintendent, verified by the certificate of two 
credible citizens, stating that the said school has been regularly held for more 
than three months in the year and the average number of scholars in such school: 
Provided, That the sum annually paid in any county under this chapter shall not 
exceed five hundred dollars.

school, shall return to the levy court of said county in March, annually, the man-

ner in which such appropriation has been applied and the vouchers therefor; and 
in default of such return, the levy court shall make no appropriation to said 
school for the next year. 
The law as originally passed, February 3, 1821, allowed 20 cents a 
scholar, with a maximum of $200 a county; afterwards amended to 40 
cents a scholar and $400 a county, and again to its present form. 
The spirit of the lawmakers may be inferred from the preamble of 
a law passed January 29, 1817, to incorporate a Sunday school: 
Whereas the establishment of Sunday schools, especially in the vicinity of 
extensive manufactories, is calculated not only to promote the instruction of the 
youth in those useful establishments in the first rudiments of learning, but to con- 
duce greatly to their good and orderly behavior by preventing them from spend- 
ing the Sabbath in idleness and contracting habits of vice and immorality: 
Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., That * * * shall be, and they are hereby, 
constituted a body politic and corporate by the name of the trustees of the 
Brandywine Manufacturers’ Sunday School. * * * 
In the reports for 1866 and 1869 of Oramel Hosford, superintend- 
ent of public instruction of the State of Michigan, space is given for 
reports of the superintendent of the American Sunday School Union 
in that State, who, in the report for 1869, claims that— 
The Sunday school does step in and quicken the sense of responsibility for edu- 
cation in these neglected communities. It works side by side with the common 
school in building up the character and intelligence of the people. 
In his report as superintendent of common schools of the Common- 
wealth of Pennsylvania for the year ending June 3, 1867, J. P. Wick- 
ersham welcomes the work of Sabbath schools as advantageous to the 
cause of public schools and pleads for reciprocal aid among those 
interested in the two forms of education.’ 
The fundamental purpose, ethical or moral and religious educa- 
tion, needs emphasis that we may the better estimate the relation 
of the agencies used. Any agency becomes relatively insignificant 
if the work it would do is accomplished through other means. Even 
the day of the Sunday school becomes subordinate, in the view of 
Henry Clay Trumbull, who, after enumerating several items that 
constitute a Sunday school, says: 
All of these particulars being found, a gathering is substantially a Sabbath 
school, on whatever day of the week it assembles or by whatever name it be called.? 
Dr. Trumbull, in broadening his definition to cover all days, gives 
opportunity to recognize some sympathy of purpose in all people who 
meet for the study of the Word of God as they accept it. This would 
bring to view that not only those who accept the Hebrew or the Chris- 
tian Seriptures—the Jews, the Christians, and the Mohammedans— 
have had such schools, but all religionists who are of a civilization 
sufficiently advanced to have any sacred books.

The religious schools of Mohammedans, of Hindus, and of Parsees 
haye to us but a remote interest in community of ulterior purpose. 
For all but exceptional cases we may accept for the United States the 
definition that ‘‘a Sunday school is an assembly of persons on the 
Lord’s Day for the study of the Bible, moral and religious instruction, 
and the worship of the true God.”! 
This will involve a study of the schools of the Jews using the Old 
Testament Scriptures and of the schools of the Christians using the 
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. 
Sunday schools in some form are as old as the observance of the 
Sabbath by families, which formed the unit of primitive instruction. 
Hebrew authors sometimes date back to the prophet Samuel, and they 
often state that to.each synagogue was attached a school in the later 
days of the nation.? The intense zeal of the Jew for education in all 
the vicissitudes of that people was set forth by J. J. Noah i in the 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1870. 
The Roman Catholic Church holds that religious instruction is an 
essential part of all education. Insisting upon such instruction daily, 
the Sunday school has not been so prominent in that church as a 
dependence upon it for religious teaching would make it. Within 
recent years the number of children who attend public schools and 
the conditions regarding religious instruction in these schools have 
apparently prompted greater attention to Sunday schoolsamong Roman 
Catholics. They now have a great number of Sunday schools, ocecu- 
pying about an hour of each Sabbath in catechetical instruction and 
in Bible history. Some churches have also Saturday morning classes 
for pupils of the public schools. 
Some Protestants hold views similar to those of the Roman Catholies 
as to need of religion in every stage of education. A few are unwill- 
ing to accept any instruction separated from religious influences, and 
so there are some permanent parochial schools and a great number of 
secondary and superior schools under the religious motives. There 
are some who utilize the public schools for ordinary instruction and 
endeavor by brief terms of parochial schools in the vacations of pub- 
lic schools to secure religious foundations in the minds of the chil- 
dren. Those who have temporary parochial schools generally have 
Sunday schools also. To the great multitude of Protestants and of 
those who have no very earnest adherence to any profession the Sun- 
day school has now become the principal agency for religious instruc-

tion. The large Sunday schools with convenient equipment are 
divided into at least three general departments: Infant or primary, 
intermediate, adult oradvanced. ‘Within late years:another has been 
introduced, known as the home department. In this department are 
enrolled persons who can not attend the school, but who study the 
lessons and read the prescribed passages at home, reporting in some 
form to the school officers. Their names sometimes swell the rolls, 
somewhat as the names of students in university extension courses 
might swell the catalogue of the parent institution if so used. 
There is.a vast amount of material ready for the Sunday school in 
the way of helps, lesson leaves, weekly comments on the lessons in reli- 
gious and secular papers. The Sunday school as established in this 
country was intended asa help to home training. In modern life, 
where so many families separate for their various occupations before 
breakfast and rarely come together at any meal, home education has 
lost ground. The advocates of the Sunday school may seriously 
inquire whether it has grown to the fulfillment of the work thus left 
for it to do or whether itis possible by any external agency to supply 
the place of home influence. 
The Jewish habits of education descended into Christian practice 
and religious instruction is everywhere commensurate with the state 
of the chureh. The early reformers, such as the Albigenses in the 
eleventh century, the Waldenses in the twelfth, John Wycliff in the 
fourteenth (1324(?)-1384), John Huss (1369-1415) in the fourteenth 
and early in the fifteenth, and the Bohemian or Moravian Brethren 
in the latter part of the fifteenth century, all laid special emphasis on 
instruction in the Scriptures. The Catholic Church kept up a degree 
of instruction in periods of decline, the Waldensian movement origi- 
nating at Lyons, where there was already a famous cathedral school. 
The reformer Martin Luther (1483-1546) laid down a scheme for com- 
plete edueation by the State in which religious instruction was fun- 
damental. Of the relation of Luther to Sunday schools more will 
appear in treating of Lutheran schools. Apparently quickened by 
the activity of the reformers, the mother church produced great agen- 
cies for education. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556) organized the Jesuits 
and inspired a zeal for religious instruction, and Cardinal Carlo Bor- 
romeo (1538-1584) is by some called the founder of Sunday:schools.! 
A little later, on the reform side were Comenius (1592-1670), Philip 
Jacob Spener (1635-1705), and Hermann Francke (1663-1727). On 
the Catholic side, in the same period, was the organization by Jean 
Baptiste de la Salle (1654-1719) of the Brothers of Christian Schools 
(1684), an order devoted to teaching and founding their work ona 
religious basis.

  Calvin (1509-1564) in Switzerland, John Knox (1505-1572) in Scotland, 
were, like him, earnest for religious education. The influence of the 
Swiss reformers especially was felt in France and the Low Countries. 
The Presbyterians and the Baptists in the United States have a spe- 
cial inheritance from the Huguenots, the Scotch Presbyterians, and 
the Holland reformed bodies, and the present Congregationalists were 
influenced by the contact of their fathers with Holland. 
As will be seen later, the Lutherans claim a continuous history of 
nearly four centuries for their Sunday schools; the Roman Catholics 
would hardly acknowledge any complete cessation of their Sunday 
schools, at least from the days of Borromeo. It is altogether probable 
that Sunday schools had not wholly died out in England, but they 
were of limited influence when, in 1780, Robert Raikes gathered poor 
children in Gloucester, England, to teach them to read, utilizing the 
Sabbath as the day when they were not at work, and so far having the 
Bible in view that Bible societies grew out of his labors. Some writ- 
ers are content to call Robert Raikes the founder of the modern Sun- 
day school, which, however, needs a further limitation, making it the 
modern Sunday school as initiated in England. 
The Sunday schools of Germany require such characterization as 
will show their historical relations and enable anyone who wishes to 
follow the subject further to do so intelligently. It is said! that the 
Church Reformation was destructive as well as constructive, and that 
some of the schools existing in cities and villages under the auspices 
of the Catholic Church were displaced. It is to be remembered that 
the German Empire of to-day, and yet more the Germany of earlier 
years, is not a unit to which any statement will apply uniformly, but 
it comprises a multitude of States (26) as independent and as unlike 
in internal administration as Maine and Texas in our own country. 
Therefore the student of German history has constant need of eaution 
to discriminate between what was true in some State of Germany 
and what was true for Germany as a whole. The general require- 
ments in German States have been for attendance at school till 14 
years ofage. Certain causes forrelaxation of the law were recognized, 
put the authorities did not relax the requirements for education; they 
simply modified the mode of acquirement and established supplemen- 
tary or extension schools, nights and Sundays, which became a part 
of the system of the State, and within the last fifty years, in some 
communities, attendance has been compulsory to 18 years of age. 
The State, comprising a State church, carried the system of parallel 
secular and religious instruction existing in week-day schools into 
these supplementary schools. Their seeular work is influenced by 
localneeds. Courses in agriculture, commerce, industry, and forestry

  are established according to the prevailing occupations of the patrons. 
Other phases of German Sunday schools will appear under the title 
Lutheran.* 
In our own country the Sunday school has nominally been almost 
wholly for scriptural instruction and the school has usually been 
assigned but a brief portion of the day, in one session, not exceeding 
an hour and a half, on the presumption that other religious services 
would occupy the attention of the members. In recent years the Sun- 
day school has tended to be the only service for the very young. 
In this country voluntary teaching is nearly universal, but there 
are a few great Sunday schools that seem to demand the time of their 
superintendents to such a degree that a small number receive pay 
from the churches. A considerable proportion of the teachers in the 
Hebrew schools are paid. Complete statistics are not available as to 
the payment of teachers. At an early stage of the Raikes movement 
the cost of paid teachers began to look formidable, and voluntary help 
was utilized to a great extent. It is easy to understand that very . 
excellent people of high qualifications, supported by other means, 
might be found to devote an hour or two on one day to scriptural 
teaching without hindrance to ordinary duty, but it can hardly be 
expected that an unqualified indorsement will be given to the follow- 
ing claims for voluntary service: 
Hireling teachers can scarcely be expected to possess either the zeal or the 
ability of those who now engage in the work from motives of pure benevolence. 
Gratuitous instruction was an astonishing improvement of the system.? 
While selected volunteer teachers without compensation may be 
better than some paid teachers, the logic of the quotation would put 
all our schools and all religious and humanitarian enterprises in the 
hands of unpaid leaders, to the exclusion of paid teachers, superin- 
tendents, and pastors. 
England was the scene of a disintegration of ecclesiastical unity, 
beginning even before Henry VIII claimed the supremacy of the Eng- 
1The following extract, translated from a German report, exemplifies the condi- 
tions in Wiirtemberg: ‘‘The Sunday schools are avery old institution in Wiirtem- 
berg. The first beginnings of Sunday schools may be traced to achurch regulation 
of 1559. In the year 1695 these regulations concerning the schools are more defi- 
nitely formulated, and in 1739 (the ninth synodical regulation) attendance upon 
Sunday schools appears as a general legal requirement. The following quotation 
makes this very plain: ‘Young people must attend Sunday and holiday schools 
regularly until they marry, so that they will not forget easily what they have 
learned in the elementary schools; and for the additional reason that they will 
not pass the time on Sundays and holidays in sinful pursuits, but learn hymns, 
read the Bible, recite scriptural passages and the Psalms, as well as the principal 
parts of the catechism, write and read letters, and close the sessions with prayer 
and blessing.’” (Origin and development of industrial continuation schools in 
Wiirtemberg, 1889, p. 3, footnote. )

lish Church (1534). Not only was there a breaking down of estab- 
lished usage in the independency that sprung up on all sides, but 
England drifted out of harmony with the religious habits on the Con- 
tinent, in Scandinavia, or even in Scotland. By the latter part of the 
eighteenth century religious instruction was chaotic, and opportunity 
prompted the movement of Robert Raikes, closely paralleled, if not 
anticipated, by the work of John Wesley, who seems to have been 
deeply impressed by his intercourse with the Moravian, Peter Boehler, 
in London, in 1738, and with Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, 
at Hernnhut, Saxony, in 1739.1 
Had the English people but obeyed the rules laid down in their own 
state church they would have had no occasion to take up a recent 
date for the origin of their Sunday schools. Dr. Trumbull cites the 
fifty-ninth canon of 1602, never repealed, which requires that— 
Every person, vicar, or curate, upon every Sunday or holiday, before evening 
prayer, shall, for half an hour and more, examine and instruct the youth and 
ignorant persons of his parish in the Ten Commandments, the Articles of Belief, 
and in the Lord’s Prayer, and shall diligently hear, instruct, and teach them the 
catechism set forth in the Book of Common Prayer,’ 
The same canon also provided— 
That parents or servants who persistently neglect to send their children or sery- 
ants to be catechised are to be excommunicated.* 
The Sunday school of the United States followed closely upon its 
revival in England, and numerous schools were established before the 
year 1800. In 1824 the organization of the American Sunday School 
Union at Philadelphia marks a great enlargement of the work. There 
had been a First-day, or Sunday School Society (1791), and a Phila- 
delphia Sunday and Adult School Union (1817), as well asa New York 
Sunday School Union (1816). In 1827 the Sunday School Union of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in New York. Both the 
last named and the American Sunday School Union inaugurated a 
multitude of schools and published a great amount of Sunday school 
literature, including books for libraries. Other societies of less per- 
manence or more limited scope have been formed since 1825. The 
American Sunday School Union published in 1826 a series of Uniform 
Limited Lessons, and later various Union question books. Similar 
aids had been published by different parties before 1865, when coin- 
cident with the close of the civil war a marked tendency developed 
toward greater uniformity of effort, accompanied by a great increase 
in the circulation of periodicals containing notes and other helps upon

selected lessons, and culminating in the adoption upon a broad scale 
of the international system in 1873. That system claims as a great 
advantage that over all the world millions are studying the same les- 
son at the same time. 
If we were to follow the broad definition of Sunday school adopted 
by H. Clay Trumbull, which takes religious instruction rather than 
the day as the essential element, we could make for the first half of 
this century a long list of educational authorities allied with its pur- 
pose. Their plans and their practice involved far more religious 
instruction in each week than the usual Sunday school gives. Among 
those who deemed the religious motive essential and made religious 
instruction a part of the daily programme were Eliphalet Nott (1773- 
1866), president of Union College; Thomas H. Gallaudet (1787-1851), 
a pioneer instructor of mutes; Mrs. Emma Hart Willard (1787-1870), 
teacher and author; William C. Woodbridge (1794-1845), editor of 
American Annals of Education; William A. Alcott (1798-1859), a 
writer of many books on education; George B. Emerson, especially 
influential in Massachusetts and New York; and the three brothers, 
Jacob Abbott (1803-1879), John S. C. Abbott (1805-1877), Gorham 
D. Abbot! (1807-1874). There might be added many more names, 
including those of early principals of normal schools.” 
Some of the persons named and others wrote much of the philosophy 
of religion, principles of teaching and of mental growth, but certain 
books of the same period published in England were more specific as 
to details of Scripture lessons or gained more permanent hold than 
publications just mentioned. 
In the publications of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowl- 
edge, organized in 1698, and in those of the Home and Colonial Infant 
School Society, as well as in those of the British and Foreign School 
Society, Scripture lessons are prominent.® 
The committee of the Home and Colonial Society say: 
What they [the committee] are desirous of seeing in every infant school is— 
First. A simple course of religious instruction in which the great aim should be 
to teach the Scriptures, to teach the elementary truths of the Gospel, and to culti- 
vate religious feelings and impressions.

Merely mentioning Governess Life, a little book for family instruc- 
tion in which religion is made the foundation for all instruction,* and 
recalling Samuel Wilderspin’s Infant System, repeated in many edi- 
tions after its publication in 1823, and containing elaborate lessons on 
Scriptural subjects, more definite attention may be directed to books 
explicitly recognizing Sunday school work. Dunn’s Principles of 
Teaching bears the imprint of the Sunday School Union.® An edition 
with some modifications of title and matter was printed in the United 
States, with a preface by T. H. Gallaudet.® 
In that portion especially devoted to moral and religious influence, 
Secretary Dunn says: 
In all attempts to exercise moral influence over the young, the faithful inculca- 
tion of divine truth from the Bible is the first point to be regarded. * * * 
I shall say, then, first of all, if it be possible, let every child have every day some 
portion of divine truth, however small, stored up in its memory and understand- 
ing. It is the reiteration, day after day, of truth upon the mind that makes the 
impression.

Scant justice can be done the author’s ‘‘ Principles” in such brief 
quotation. He quotes Fellenberg as saying: 
Let this [the Old Testament] be the first history presented to the child, and let 
him be deeply imbued with the spirit of the Bible) * * * The best practical 
example for the educator is to be found in the Saviour of men; and in the result 
we should aim at no other object than the realization of that Kingdom of God to 
which he has directed mankind.! 
  Stow’s Training System, in its earlier editions,’ devoted over one- 
fourth its pages to Bible training, besides the recurrence to the Serip- 
tures for illustrative material throughout the whole. Later editions 
include Bible training for Sabbath schools. In its amplified form this 
book is one of the most comprehensive manuals on education. There’ 
are chapters that deal with the distinction between teaching and train- 
ing, the sympathy of numbers, and the minutest detail of model Bible 
training and secular training lessons, as well as social conditions, 
reformatory efforts, and the equipment of a school. It is hardly less 
a manual for a preacher than for a teacher, so fully does it treat of 
the principles by which one person is to influence another by personal 
and public effort. 
Some of the books cited above have disappeared from current trade, 
and are only to be found in certain libraries and old book stores. 
Dunn’s Principles of Teaching and Stow’s Training System are still 
to be had through importing booksellers. 
A great change took place in Sunday school work in the United 
States after the civilwar. Although the use of any fixed date for that 
change might provoke dissent, it was so nearly coincident with the 
revolution in various social conditions brought about by the war that 
it hardly involves error, and it adds greatly to the convenience of 
memory, to consider the new era as beginning with the rearrangement 
of forces when peace was declared. Although the general history of 
Sunday schools to that time need not be further separately treated 
here, the story of denominational movements in later pages will 
involve statements relating to earlier times. 
It will be noticed that the space given to individual denominations 
is not in proportion to the numerical strength of their Sunday schools. 
It occurs that prominent leaders in the great ‘International Lesson 
- movement” were of the Methodists and the Baptists, the largest Prot- 
estant denominations of this country. Even had no others joined 
them, it would have resulted that the conduct of the great mass of 
Sunday schools under the auspices of the International Sunday School 
Conventions would be better understood by the public than that of

churches less prominently identified or not identified with the inter- 
national movement. The literature of the International Lessons is 
only less widely diffused than the daily newspaper. Not only do 
denominational weekly journals regularly devote columns to the inter- 
national lessons, but many daily papers set apart columns of their 
Saturday issues for the same purpose. It has therefore seemed fitting 
to give more space to denominations not so fully identified with the 
lessons popular at this time and to cite particularly the principles 
which some of them lay down as a basis of work, principles often 
essentially identical with those that might have been selected from 
the more generally known sources. 
EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
For the sake of unity, Lutheran religious instruction to the present 
time will be taken as a whole. 
Martin Luther (1483-1546) published a German translation of the 
New Testament in 1522, and two catechisms, the large and the small, 
in 1529. He completed the translation of the Bible in 1532. Luther 
laid great stress upon hymns as an element of religious instruction. 
He insisted upon education with such an earnest effectiveness that 
the German systems of to-day rest largely upon the spirit inspired by 
Luther, and religious instruction was the very foundation of his plans 
for national education. Some writers give him credit for a great 
upbuilding of Sunday-school work. The Lutheran view of his work 
is shown in the succeeding quotations. 
The Lutheran Church Review of October, 1896, is almost wholly 
devoted to the subject of Sunday schools. There are 24 distinet 
articles from 3 to 13 pages each.1. These articles, partly reprints,

  form a compendium of the general history of Sunday schools and of 
the special Sunday-school work of Lutherans, explaining the need of 
religious instruction, the office of the Sunday school in aiding such 
instruction, the limitations of its conditions, with a great range of 
information upon questions as indicated by the titles. Unfortunately 
the edition was exhausted and the number is not readily accessible. 
Regarding the Sunday school in history, Professor Wackernagel 
says: 
The Sunday school * is not an invention, a discovery of our modern 
times. Its origin is found in antiquity, its development in the subsequent ages. 
  The writer explains at some length the customs of the Hebrews, the 
early Christians, and the prereformation teachers, Waldenses, Wick- 
lifites, Hussites, Bohemian Brethren, and others, who used catechisms 
containing the Decalogue, the Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer. Of later 
religious instruction, he says: 
Methodical catechetical instruction in the manner practiced by the ancient 
church was revived in the creative period of the Lutheran Reformation. * * * 
The Lutheran princes, and especially the cities, in full recognition cf the value 
and importance of Christian education, established catechetical services for chil- 
dren in the church on Sunday afternoon. These services were given in charge of 
catechetes, members of the ministerium, who possessed special gifts for this kind 
of church work. This catechetical instruction in interlocutory form was not lim- 
ited to the one hour on Sunday. At Hamburg, e. g., the great preacher Balthazar 
Schuppius taught the catechism to his parishioners’ children every morning before 
school. * * * One of the best ‘‘Sunday-school books” of all time is the Nurem- 
berg ‘‘ Kinderlehrbuechlein,” of 1628, which for many years was extensively used 
in the old-fashioned T.utheran Sunday school, the Kinderlehre. The book con- 
tains in its first part the plain text of the topics of the five chief parts of the small 
catechism for the children in the primary department; in the second part, Luther’s 
explanation of the same for the secondary department, and in the third part, in 
fifty-two lessons, an excellent exposition of Luther’s explanation for the higher 
grades. One of the catechisms in use among us, the Hanover-Celle (Stohlmann), 
is founded on the Nuremberg manual. 
The writer pays tribute to Philip Jacob Spener and his more widely 
known disciple and friend, August Hermann Francke, founder of the 
Halle Orphanage, as teachers of catechetics: 
Francke opened his ‘“‘ Ragged Sunday school” in his study in 1695, kept it open 
every day, and soon kept the ragged boys altogether until he laid the corner stone 
of the great orphanage in 1698. * * * The method he employed in imparting 
Christian knowledge was the interrogatory. Francke’s was the leading spirit in 
the Christian circles of his time, and his educational methods were diligently fol- 
lowed. They were transplanted to our shores by H. M. Muhlenberg. 
The Lutheran ‘“‘ Sunday school” in Lutheran Europe, until the partial introduc- 
tion of the Anglo-American Sunday school system thirty years ago, was, and is yet, 
the ‘‘ Kinderlehre,” conducted in church by the pastor alene, consisting in the 
declaratory explanation and interrogatory review of the Catechism and Biblical his- 
tory (the study of which was generally introduced after the Thirty Years’ War). 
But this one lesson on Sunday is not all the children get. Our church is a doc- 
trinal, indoctrinating church; she is the ‘‘schoolmistress” among the churches, 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 363 
Therefore, the ‘“ Kinderlehre” can not be the only occasion and opportunity for 
teaching and learning religious subjects. There is the daily instruction in the 
Catechism, Bible history, and the church hymns in the parochial school; the 
weekly catechetical recitations with the pastor in very many places; and above 
all, the thoroughgoing catechetical instruction before confirmation. * 
The English Sunday school was introduced into America by the Methodist 
Bishop Asbury, in 1786. 
Dr. Schantz shows that, while in schools of the early part of the 
century in this country instruction in reading, writing, and spelling 
was prominent, ‘‘the Sunday schools established chiefly for secular 
instruction soon felt the effeet of the new system of religious teach- 
ing and gradually declined.” In his personal recollections of Sunday 
schools he mentions aids furnished by various agencies, among which 
are ‘‘an excellent German Question Book, * * * a small work in 
German * * * for opening and closing the school, The Jugend 
Freund and the Youth’s Penny Gazette,” monthly, a Sunday school 
Union Hymn Book, Question Book of the American Sunday School 
Union, Barnes’ Notes. In the Trinity Sunday school of Lancaster in 
1853— 
the order of service and the catechism were regularly used at the opening and 
closing of the school, and thus the Commandments, the Apostle’s Creed, and the 
Lord’s Prayer were repeated in each session. The pastor of the congregation met 
the teachers to aid them in preparing the lesson. All the features of the school 
had a decidedly churchly and Lutheran stamp. * * * 
In 1857 the Sunday school [at Reading] held two sessions each Sunday. 
  Mr. Boschen states of the Lutheran Sunday schools in New York, 
that— 
Nearly, if not all, of the schools have two sessions, one in the morning before 
service and one in the afternoon, * * * 
It is very generally conceded that our church has utilized scarce a fraction of 
the wondrous power of her youth at command; and, with no effective oversight 
and a lack of systematic organization, the work of our Lutheran Sunday schools, 
as well as all other branches of our church work, has been left to the spasmodic 
activity of individual congregations. * * * Wehave no systematic, no effect- 
ive, Sunday school organization. This want has been felt by a number of the 
more progressive workers, yet how to work harmoniously is the great question, 
Almost all of the schools use different lesson leaves; some none at all, Others use 
Biblical histories; yet others lay particular stress on the study of the catechism, 
and in many is added the study of the German language. 
There are twenty-nine Lutheran Sunday schools in synodical con- 
nection in New York City, besides independent schools. Mr. Boschen 
makes this criticism upon the selection of teachers: 
Another weakness has been our Haste to take young people as soon as they were 
confirmed, on the plea of necessity, to make teachers of them. Without a proper 
appreciation of their high calling, with little or no ability to fit them for the post, 
they are given classes from a desire to assign some work to them where theleast (?) 
harm can be done, and that place is the Sunday school! It is the place of all 
others where the foundation for future religious growth is laid and where the 
greatest care and conscientiousness should beexercised. After these young teach-
-P-A-G-E-444
364 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  ers have been put in charge of a class, no effort is made to instruct them how to 
proceed. In answer to my question, ‘‘ Do teachers have preparatory hours for the 
study of the lesson?” but eight schools answered affirmatively. It is therefore 
remarkable that the schools have apparently prospered so well. 
The Rey. John A. W. Haas would reach the whole life without an 
age limit and— 
the Bible study must be accompanied constantly by Luther's smaller catechism. 
* * % A Lutheran Sunday school should have the catechism as the principle 
of its whole grading, because the various stages of its knowledge are so bound up 
with the various stages of the Christian life in the Lutheran Church. Thereshould 
also be a time set apart in every Lutheran Sunday school not only for memoriz- 
ing but also for the explanation of the catechism. 
In speaking of the Lutheran Sunday school Dr. Trabert defines— 
the Kinderlehre of the Lutheran Church in Germany, instituted by * * * 
Rey. Philip Jacob Spener, about the year 1666. * * * This Kinderlehre was 
for old and young, but especially intended for the confirmed youth, and consisted 
in a brief opening service with singing, Scripture reading, and prayer, followed by 
examination in the catechism and the texts of Scripture illustrating the several 
parts. 
The Sunday school goes further and is more comprehensive than the Kinder- 
fehro..-* 6 + 
The system of instruction in the Lutheran Sunday school begins with the little 
ones and is continued through all the departments—infant, intermediate, and the 
so-called Bible class—haying this sole aim: The honor of God in Jesus Christ our 
Lord. ee 
Persons not well grounded in the faith, who have no positive convictions with 
respect to the doctrines of the church, have no place as teachers in a Lutheran 
Sunday school, for it is of the greatest importance that the children be started 
pent +: * 
Too much stress can not be laid on the service and hymns of the church in the 
Sunday school. * * * 
It is of the greatest importance that the children early learn to appreciate the 
church’s magnificent treasure in her matchless hymns and unrivaled service. The 
Sunday school must lead into the inner sanctuary by acquainting the children 
with and awakening a love for the full service of the sanctuary. To this end the 
matin and vesper service are peculiarly adapted. 
The Augustana Synod is formed of Swedish churches. Rey. A. 
Rodell gives an explanation of Swedish religious education. He says: 
The Sunday school was an institution with which the Swedish colonists were 
not at all familiar, as the children of the State Church of Sweden received their 
religious training in the public schools. * *-* In the public schools of 
Sweden about an hour every day is devoted to the reading of the Bible and reli- 
gious instruction. * * * The fundamental doctrines of Christianity and the 
tenets of the Lutheran Church are inculcated by trained teachers during the entire 
week, and, asa matter of course, the Sunday school can not be considered to be 
of the same importance there as it really is in this country, where no religious 
education is to be had in the public school. 
As stated by Mr. Rodell, in 1886 there were 483 congregations and 
17,406 scholars in Sunday schools; in 1896 there were 806 congrega- 
tions and 42,847 scholars in this synod. 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 365 
  The description of English Lutheran Sunday schools in the West 
will serve well for other Sunday schools in the newer parts of the 
country. Rey. James F. Beates, writing from the State of Washing- 
ton, says: 
In the manner of conducting our Sunday schools there is little to distinguish 
them from those of the East, * * We use the same publications and helps 
that are found in the Eastern schools, and in general follow the recommendations of 
the boards and authorities which are chiefly located in the East. And yet our 
schools are distinguished by their greater inability to carry out these regulations. 
The chief difficulty we find is an insufficient force of effective officers andi teach- 
ers. This universal want is the greater the farther west one goes. 
A further hindrance to our work is the lack of male help. * * ‘The men 
ought to be as capable and willing to instruct the young as the women. The 
teaching force should be more evenly divided. The example of an active corps of 
men in the Sunday school is a powerful help in retaining the boys. * * * 
Another evil peculiar to the West is the roving, shifting character of our peo- 
ple. * * * But few children in our frontier schools remain long enough to 
grow up from the infant to the Bible class. Hence there is not. that rooting and 
grounding in the faith, that bond of attachment which the children in the older 
East enjoy.     
   
The following table of the Sunday schools of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church is derived from the Church Almanac, 1896, when 
not otherwise specified. It will be observed by those familiar with 
the Lutheran Church that some synods are not. reported, and it will 
be seen by the table that certain others are only partially reported. 
The synods are not geographical in any strict sense, hence it is not 
practicable to make a table by States from the table by synods.

It would take this report into a wider field than is now expedient 
to point out in each case the indications of the influences of special 
national or religious influences brought into this country from 
abroad, but the distribution of forms of religious faith or practice 
points to antecedents, sometimes clear by present perpetuation of a 
foreign tongue, sometimes, especially as to Scotch, French Huguenot, 
Holland or Duteh, and Irish influences, obseured by an absorption of 
language or dialect into the Anglo-Saxon. 
The Lutherans are mainly of German or Scandinavian descent. 
The following table of communicants, as shown in the census of 1890, 
will show their geographical distribution and afford a rough guide

  UNITED EVANGELICAL CHURCH SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The United Evangelical Church is the name taken by a body recently 
a part of the Evangelical Association, Their Sunday-school statistics 
are given in The Evangelical Almanac, 1896, Harrisburg, Pa., by con- 
ferences, which can be distributed by States with general correctness 
without a separate table. The editor of the Almanac states that the 
statistics are imperfect, owing to delay in returns, for which the 
Almanae could not wait.

GERMAN EVANGELICAL SYNODS OF NORTH AMERICA, SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The organization known as the German Evangelical Synods of North 
America embraces about 1,000 congregations. In 1896 there were 
reported 185,203 communicants. There is a theological seminary at 
St. Louis, and there is a proseminary at Elmhurst, Il., near Chicago. 
About one-half of the churches maintain week-day schools. A large 
part of the pastors are also teachers. Great attention is paid to the 
principles of teaching. The Paedagogische Zeitschrift, St. Louis, is 
a monthly devoted to the subject of pedagogy, especially as related to 
the conduct of schools in the German Evangelical Synods. 
The Evangelischer Kalender, 1896, St. Louis, Mo., gives the num- 
ber of Sunday school scholars as 82,628 and that of teachers as 8,694, 
not distributed by States. 
JOHN AMOS COMENIUS AND THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN. 
To understand the Moravians, we must look back at least three 
centuries. The Church of the United Brethren, Unitas Fratrum, or 
the Morayians, is the equivalent of the Bohemian Brethren who traced 
their denominational origin to John Huss (1373-1415). The last 
bishop of the Bohemian Brethren was John Amos Comenius (1592- 
1670), one of the most remarkable among educators. His outline of 
organization is followed in the best schools of to-day, and his Orbis 
Pictus was the prototype of the wonderful variety of children’s illus- 
‘trated books of later time. He left his impress upon schools of cen- 
tral Europe, but more distinctly upon those of Sweden and Denmark, 
being employed to draft plans and prepare books for the Swedish 
schools, partly by residents of Denmark. The recent translation of 
his principal treatise! is accompanied by a sketch of his life, which is 
utilized for the material here presented regarding his work. 
The esteem in which educators hold the name of Comenius, the 
commanding influence he exercised upon the spirit of the Moravians 
and upon general education, and the orderly system of his plan make 
it specially fitting to cite his educational scheme as typical of views 
not limited to Moravians, but prevailing in various denominations. 
In 1629, Wolfgang Ratke, supposed to exercise some influence on 
Comenius, had submitted a programme of education to a commission 
at Jena. The first of its items was ‘‘ Everything is to be preceded by 
_prayer,” and the fifteenth, ‘‘Education should begin with religion.” 
Comenius, anticipating more modern leaders in the philosophy and 
the art of education, prepared an outline of the Pansophic School 
about 1650, in which the work of a complete education was divided 
for seven classes. The general school was to spend the first hour of 
the morning in hymns, Bible reading, and prayers.

  370 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In Class I, the Vestibular, with an inscription over the door, ‘Let 
no one enter who can not read,” ‘The religious exercises consist of 
the heads of the catechism, together with a few short prayers and 
hymns.” There is also prescribed ‘‘a course of moral philosophy 
suited to children.” 
In Class II, the Janual, with the inscription, ‘‘Let no one enter 
who is ignorant of mathematics,” ‘‘The catechism is to be thor- 
oughly learned.” 
Class III, the Atrial, was to have the inscription, “‘Let no one 
enter who can not speak.” 
In this class the boys should begin to read the Bible, but not as it stands, An 
abridged form, suited to their intelligence, should be given to them, and a por- 
tion of this must be expounded daily. * * * The history for this class is the 
famous deeds of the Biblical narrative. 
Class IV, the Philosophical, is inscribed, ‘‘Let no one ignorant of 
history enter here.” 
A special collection of hymns and psalms must be arranged for this class; also 
an epitome of the New Testament, which should comprise a continuous life of 
Christ and His Apostles, compiled from the four Gospels. * * * The accessory 
study is'Greck. * * * Itiscomparatively easy to learn ‘to read the New Testa- 
ment, and this is the chief utility of the study. 
Over the door of Class V, the Logical, is the inscription, “Let no 
one enter who is ignorant of natural philosophy.” 
Religious instruction comprises hymns, psalms, and prayers. A Bible manual 
also, called the Gate of the Sanctuary, is to be placed in the :pupil’s hands. This 
is to contain ‘the whole of Scripture history in the words of the Bible, but so 
digested that it may be read in one year. 
Class VI, the Political, is inscribed, ‘Let no one enter who ean not 
reason,” ‘‘In Theology the whole Bible is to be read.” 
For the preceding classes only those injunctions have been selected 
which had a specifically religious character, but as all other studies 
are made to center in religious education, the whole plan for Class 
VII, the Theological, is given: 
1. Inscription over the door: ‘‘ Let no one enter who is irreligious.” 
2. The walls should ‘be covered with mystic symbols, illustrating the wisdom 
hidden in the ‘Scriptures. On one ‘wall diagramsiof Hebrew grammar may be 
traced. : 
3. The most devotional psalms.and hymns of the church may be used, as well as 
prayers of a special nature taken from the Scriptures and from the works of the 
most inspired theologians and of the sainted martyrs. In addition, a compendium 
of Christian beliefs, duties, and hopes, written in the phraseology of the Bible, 
should be read daily. 
4, The class book should be a work dealing with the last stage of wisdom on 
earth, that is to say, the communion of souls with God, and should consist of 
three parts: 
(a) The ascent of the mind to God. In this a survey should be made of the uni- 
verse, preserving the order of the Janua, and with regard to each fact should be 
pointed out what God tells us about it in the Scriptures, and how the Heaven and 
the earth and all that in them is tell the glory of God.
-P-A-G-E-451
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 371 
(b) The formal part should consist of a key to God’s Book; that is to say, prac- 
tical rules for reading the Scriptures with profit and for duly considering the 
works of God. Here a threefold commentary should be supplied: (1) From Scrip- 
ture itself; (2) from reason; (3) from sense experience. 
(c) The third part should be a repertory of theology, giving a detailed account 
of the mysteries of salvation. 
5. In arithmetic the sacred and mystic numbers that occur in the Scriptures 
should be studied; also sacred architecture, as exemplified by Noah’s Ark, the Tab- 
ernacle, and the Temple. 
6. Universal history should be studied, and in particular the history of the 
‘ein for whose sake the world exists. * * * 
. In this class some training should be given in oratory. Tho future minister 
fast learn how to address a congregation, and should be taught the laws of sacred 
oratory. The future politician must be taught how to appeal to the reason of his 
hearers. 
8. The accessory study is Hebrew, which must be studied in such a way that 
before the end of the year the pupil shall be able to read and understand the origi- 
nal text of the Scriptures. 
9. Recreation is to be allowed, but must not interfere with the theological 
studies. 
10. Religious plays, dealing with the character of, say, Abraham or David, may 
be acted.! 
  In 1559 Calvin reorganized a Latin school at Geneva. It was 
insisted that— 
Each lesson, no matter what the subject be, must commence with prayer.? 
Jn the Great Didactic, Comenius says: 
The holy Scriptures must be the Alpha and the Omega of Christian schools.* 
Comenius divided the first twenty-four years of life into four peri- 
ods or grades, to each of which he would assign a special school, thus: 
I. For infancy the mother’s knee. 
II. For childhood the vernacular school. the school should bi TI. For boyhood . the Latin school or gymnasium, 
IV. For youth 5] the university and travel. 
A mother should exist in every house, a vernacular school in every hamlet and 
village, a eyes am in every city, and a university in every kingdon or in every 
provance. * * 
The mother school and the vernacular school embrace all the young of both 
sexes. The Latin school gives a more thorough education to those who aspire 
higher than the workshop; while the university trains up the teachers and the 
learned men of the future, that our churches, schools, and states may never lack 
suitable leaders.* 
  The plan outlined for education reads so much like the most thought- 
ful plans of modern days that one is tempted to quote beyond what is 
pertinent to the subject of the religious, and therefore important in 
the discussion of Sunday schools as now conducted. Passing by, how- 
ever, all of the twenty-six paragraphs in the sketch of the mother

school not explicitly religious, two must here suffice to show the prep- 
aration demanded at home before gathering in a formal school: 
They will take their first lessons in music by learning easy hymns and psalms. 
This exercise should form part of their daily devotions.’ * 
Finally, by the time they are 6 years old boys should have made considerable 
progress in religion and piety; that is to say, they should have learned the heads 
of the catechism and the principles of Christianity, and should understand these 
and live up to them as far as their age permits.” 
  The vernacular school of Comenius would correspond in a general 
way to the public common schools of to-day in countries giving reli- 
gious instruction in such schools. 
The aim and object * * * should be to teach to all the young between the 
ages of 6 and 12 such things as will be of use to them throughout their whole 
Beene 
To learn by heart the greater part of the psalms and hymns that are used in the 
country: * ** 
Besides the catechism, they should know the most important stories ang verses 
in the Bible, and should be able to repeat them word by word. - * 
They should also learn the general history of the world, its creation, its fall, its 
redemption, and its preservation by God up to the present day.? 
He would arrange these pupils in six classes, but it is unnecessary 
to follow the subdivisions, which suggest the grades below the high 
schools in this country. 
The Moravians are numerically weak, but they exercise a relatively 
great moral power, especially as missionary laborers. A group of 
schools at Bethlehem, Pa., and one at Salem, N. C., represent their 
chief centers of concentrated effort in this country. The congrega- 
tion at Bethlehem, the settlement of Count Zinzendorf, maintains a 
parochial school of high rank, established in 1742. 
The Moravian Almanac and Year Book, London, 1896, gives the 
location, address of pastor, number of communicants and total mem- 
bership, and number of scholars and teachers in the Sunday school 
for each church of the denomination, from which statements the fol- 
lowing table is prepared:

PRESBYTERIAN SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
  The history of Sunday schools of the Lutherans and of the Mora- 
vians, as well as that of schools of the Calvinistic Presbyterians, of 
Hebrews, and of Catholics, has a double interest in the light thrown 
upon conditions in continental Europe while the new continent was 
being peopled and in the work which they have done in this country. 
The Presbyterians have preserved something of the zeal for reli- 
gious instruction impressed by Calvin directly in Switzerland, indi- 
rectly upon the Huguenots of France, and reformers in Holland, and 
through John Knox upon the Scotch and Scotch-Irish ancestors of 
Presbyterians in the United States. 
The Westminster Catechism is widely used as a book of instruction 
among Presbyterians. 
Presbyterian Church of the United States of America.—The minutes 
of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United 
States of America, sometimes called Northern Presbyterian, give the

schools held all the year; in average attendance; scholars in full

REFORMED CHURCH IN AMERICA, SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The Reformed Church in America, colloquially called Dutch 
Reformed, is Calvinistic and related to the Presbyterian. There is a 
considerable membership of natives of Holland. 
The committee of the General Synod of the Reformed Church in 
America upon Sunday schools and catechetical instruction t deems it 
essential that the Sunday schools shall be kept under the responsible 
control of the respective churches and not become distinet, independ- 
ent organizations. 
In the mind of your committee, this question of consistorial supervision opens 
up the most important phase of the whole Sunday school problem, and touches a 
principle vital to the whole question of the relation of the Sunday school to the 
church, * * Many pastors and consistories are seriously deprecating what 
seems to be a tendency in the trend of Sunday school development, through the 
influence of undenominational or interdenominational agencies—such as town, 
county, and State organizations, undenominational ‘‘ helps’*—to “institutionalize” 
the Sunday school. Whether or not the Sunday school is growing out of its 
normal position as an integral part of the church organism into the position of a 
rival to the church may fairly be questioned. 
  The committee also recognizes a demand for a return to the Bible 
pure and simple, without the lesson helps in general use. Of the 
churches with catechetical work, about two-thirds catechise in the 
Sunday school and one-third ‘‘catechise in eatechetical class, the latter 
almost entirely in our Holland and German churches.” 
cts and Proceedings, 1896, just cited, show under each classis 
ber of Sunday schools and total enrollment, as well as num- 
atechumens for each church. The catechumens aggregate 
,000, approaching one-third the enrollment in Sunday schools. 
re no means of determining how far the catechumens are 
of the Sunday schools, but they represent a specifie effort 
at systematic religious instruction. The following table, by classes,

CONGREGATIONAL [TRINITARIAN] SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
Congregationalism represents an intense independency, each church 
controlling its own affairs, yet there is such a habit of association that 
something like a denominational standard prevails, approaching a 
Trinitarian Presbyterianism with those called Orthodox Congrega- 
tionalist in Massachusetts, and those of kindred views elsewhere, and 
of a different type from those under the name Unitarian. The pecul- 
iar geographical distribution will be evident in the table. The Con- 
gregational Year Book, 1896, gives under each State each Sunday 
school by name, name of superintendent, members, average, and fam- 
ilies; independent and missionary schools by States, by name and 
membership. It will be noticed that officers and teachers and schol- 
ars are not separated.

BAPTIST SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The great denomination of the Baptists, like the Congregational, 
is bound together more by the habit of association than by a recog- 
nized authority of any ecclesiastical body to control the individual 
church. 
The American Baptist Year Book, 1896, gives by States the num- 
ber of Sunday schools, of officers and teachers, and of pupils as

PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
In Episcopal Sunday schools courses of catechetical instruction upon 
the Bible, the doctrines, and the history of the church are prominent, 
The editions of catechisms are numerous, being often prepared with 
reference to the needs of individual dioceses. At Milwaukee the fol- 
lowing combination is published as constituting ‘‘ a graded course for 
the Christian year:” Church teaching for the little ones of the Church, 
by Emma Anderson Tew; the young churchman’s catechism; a prac- 
tical question book on the Bible for juvenile scholars; a catechism 
on the Christian year and the collects, including the church cate- 
chism; systematic Bible study for advanced classes—the last four by 
Miss L. L. Robinson. 
The publisher states that— 
The five catechisms named above comprise a graded series for Sunday school 
children in the order named. Each is arranged in chapters for every Sunday in 
the Christian year. 
Another combination of manuals-of instruction for the children of 
the church is called the Maryland series. It consists of: J. A new 
first catechism. II. The gospel story, a second catechism for the lit- 
tle ones. III. The church catechism, from the Book of Common 
Prayer. IV. The creed, being an exposition of the faith of the 
Church as set forth in the Apostles’ Creed. A new fourth catechism, 
by the Right Rev. William Paret, D. D., bishop of Maryland. 
Other series, as Bible lessons for the Christian year, and lessons 
of the uniform system of the joint diocesan committee, claim a very 
large circulation. 
A special church service for children is a regular appointment in 
many parishes. 
The number of Sunday schools is not available, but the numbers of 
teachers and scholars of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United 
States of America are shown in the following table, in which dioceses 
and missions have been rearranged to facilitate determining attend- 
ance by States: *

  METHODIST EPISCOPAL SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The founders of Methodism were from the Established Church of 
England, generally called, as organized in the United States, the 
Protestant Episcopal. The church has been prominent in Sunday 
school work in England and the United States from the days of its 
founders. 
The Methodist kindergarten of the church has for its purpose “‘to 
introduce the principles of the kindergarten into the primary depart- 
ment of the Sunday school; also to reeommend that there be five ses- 
sions for this department during the week in addition to the one on 
Sunday.”

There are no data accessible for a satisfactory arrangement of the 
Sunday schools by States, but the scholars slightly outnumber the 
communicants or members of the Methodist Church at the census of 
1890. The table of church membership by States, therefore, may 
roughly suggest the local strength of the Sunday schools. It is as 
follows:

EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  FRIENDS, FIRST-DAY OR BIBLE SCHOOLS. 
The Friends or Quakers_comprise two considerable bodies, known 
as Orthodox and Hicksite, besides lesser divisions. 
Orthodox Friends.—The Orthodox Friends often designate their 
First-day schools as Bible schools or Scripture schools. There is no 
central summary for the church, but several of the yearly meetings 
composing the organization make reports, from which a partial and 
inadequate view of their work has been compiled. The reports of 
yearly meetings have not been fully available. 
The minutes of the New York Yearly Meeting of Friends, 1896, 
contain a table of nine causes of success, of which the first is 
“Dependence on the written word of God, not upon helps.” Conse- 
eration and preparation are repeatedly emphasized in the table. In 
a table of fifteen present needs of the schools are: A separate primary 
room; punctuality; reading matter suitable for young children; mem- 
orizing of Scripture by the children. Among eight ‘‘results of a year 
of hard work and earnest prayer” are: An increase of Bible study, a 
deepening in spiritual things; an improvement in the use of Bibles 
in the class, teacher and pupil bring their own, leaving helps at home; 
children learning to read the Bible daily at home; conversions; 
troublesome boys becoming much changed. 
The minutes of the Ohio Yearly Meeting, 1896, mention that many 
Friends are in the daily practice of reading a portion of Scripture 
with their families collected, attended by a season of devotion. 
The minutes of the Iowa Yearly Meeting, 1896, have a remarkable 
record in the relatively large numbers in Bible schools, and in the 
large proportion of. families that have some defined religious home 
training, there being a membership of 11,124, an enrollment in Bible 
schools of 7,709, and 983 families that read the Scriptures with daily 
devotions. 
In the minutes of the California Yearly Meeting, 1896, the super- 
intendent of the Bible school department makes the suggestion: 
In the future let our work in this department be known as Bible school work 
rather than Sabbath school, the title to my mind being in every way as compre- 
hensive, and more appropriate to the work we design accomplishing. 
The Baltimore Yearly Meeting reports gain in Bible schools. The 
report of the Home Mission Committee contains the suggestion that— 
An invitation to join in Bible study at a private house will often meet with a 
gratefulresponse and open the way for very definite work. 
The report of the same committee contains the following item illus- 
trating success in that direction: 
We have recentiy learned of a family belonging to our meeting who are living 
ata great distance from any other Friends, and some miles from any church build- 
ing, whose interest in those living about them was so aroused by the spiritual need
-P-A-G-E-469

that they opened their house on First-day morning for Bible school and meeting. 
At last accounts so many had responded to their invitations that the rooms of the 
house were too small to hold them, 75 people being present on one day.

Hicksite Friends.—Among the Hicksite Friends the First-day 
schools are not all confined to Bible lessons, but they deal sometimes 
with ethical or humanitarian subjects.! 
The Proceedings of the twentieth session of the First-day school 
general conference, held at Swarthmore College August 19-20, 1896, 
contain discussions and statistics of the work as done among that 
body. of Friends known as Hicksite, reported in the last census as hay- 
ing in round numbers 22,000 members. 
The schools generally use lesson leaves prepared by a literature 
committee. In the past four years the Gospels, Acts, and Romans 
haye been the subjects of study, and itis proposed to continue with 
the Epistles till the next general conference (1899). Old Testament 
studies are under consideration. A Book of Devotional Poems and 
Selections from Whittier’s Poems are considerably used. 
The conference was marked by an earnest, hearty attention to the 
subjects in hand, with a minimum of incidental adjuncts. Cornelia 
J. Shoemaker took the leading part on First-day school extension. 
She said: 
Much would be accomplished in many of our First-day schools by better classi- 
fication, and through the recognition of this pedagogical law that the same truth 
is not food for children of all ages. * * * In the child we see the type of the 
race. His narrowed horizon shuts out from view the truth we fain would teach, 
until a simpler lesson lifts hitn to that height from which it can be seen. 
The work for our smallest classes should be that most easily comprehended. 
Stories from the Old Testament, interspersed with lessons drawn from daily life 
and illustrated by means of those indispensable adjuncts to all school work, the

nomics, by Amos G. Warner. 1895. 12°, pp. 8 + 430.

  blackboard and crayon, might prove helpful to the very little ones. From Old 
Testament stories they might pass to New Testament biography. * * * 
A course in Bible history, or the growth of Israel’s national life, in which might 
be noted the radical characteristics and unusual environment which had so 
marked an effect upon the development of its peculiar genius, should follow. 
In connection it would be profitable to study the bibles of the so-called pagan 
world. Not to the Jews alone did the Great Soul of the Universe reveal Himself. 
His divine hand as surely guided the thought and destiny of every race. * * * 
To know our own Bible truly we must know those of other lands. 
The last years in the First-day school could be devoted to New Testament his- 
tory and the study of the books of the Bible in the order of their birth. Thus by 
connected reading the message of each book will be made clear, and the student 
will realize as never before the incalculable debt which literature, art, and ethics 
owe to this library of the past. 
This speaker advocated adult classes among work people like these 
of Friends in England, explained later by John William Graham. 
The committee from the Baltimore Yearly Meeting said in its report: 
In all of our meetings there are first-day schools where the older members with 
the younger join in sincere and zealous efforts to find the truths of religion as 
initiated by Christ in His wonderful Sermon on the Mount. 
Positive denominational teaching is favored. ‘‘All of our schools 
use the ‘Friends’ Scripture Lessons,’ and_‘ Illustrated Lesson Leaves,’ 
and satisfaction with them appears to prevail,” with a reservation as 
to their adaptation to infant classes. 
William M. Jackson expressed his pleasure that the Baltimore 
schools taught the doctrines of the Society of Friends. He defined 
the one distinctive doctrine * * * that there is.to-day, as there ever was, an 
intercommunication of the Divine with the human spirit and that what Friends 
call the Light within is the revelation of God in the human heart. 
The report from New York had a special feature: ‘‘In circulation 
among the country schools eight traveling libraries, containing 339 
volumes.” Edward B. Rawson said: 
We appropriate a small sum every year to the use of the library committee. 
The committee fits out libraries of about fifty volumes each, boxes them up and 
sends them off to the First-day schools expressing a desire for them, When these 
First-day schools have read the books and gotten all they can out of them they are 
sent on to some other First-day school. Each year we put a few more books in 
circulation. 
The report from Indiana elicited from John H. Shotwell: 
That part of the report that struck me most forcibly was the penny collection 
for the use of the library, enforcing the importance of giving to religious works. 
In the discussion, ‘‘ How shall we better qualify ourselves for First- 
day school teaching?” Frances M. Robinson said: 
In determining how we may better qualify ourselves for the work we must first 
have a distinct and definite idea of what we shall try to accomplish. The proper 
work of the First-day school may be embraced under three heads: 
First. To give a knowledge of the Bible, its contents, its authoritativeness, its 
intent, and its rightful influence.
-P-A-G-E-471
  SUNDAY SCHOOLS. : 891 
Second. To present and explain our principles and testimonies, the source from 
which derived, the circumstances which gave them birth, their reasonableness and 
sufficiency. 
Third. To inspire devotion and conservation of life. To impress upon every 
heart the necessity for working out its soul’s salvation with fear and trembling 
before God. 
William W. Birdsall, indorsing Frances M. Robinson’s presentation 
of the subject and her plea for study of the Bible and books showing 
the Friends’ doctrines, would make her third purpose of the school 
rst in order— 
The one great purpose of the First-day school—to instill devotion and conserva- 
tion of life, to teach the child its relation to God and its duty toward God. And 
as a means to that end, and not as a purpose in itself, to give to the child a knowl- 
edge of the Bible and its contents, its sources and its rightful influence. 
Books named by the last two quoted were: Summary of Christian 
Doctrines as held by the Religious Society of Friends, by Samuel M. 
Janney; Religious Views of the Society of Friends, by Howard M. 
Jenkins—both very small books; Quaker Strongholds, by Caroline 
Stevens; Quaker Ideals, by Francis Frith. 
John William Graham spoke upon adult schools in England of 
interest here in the possibilities of their reproduction in the United 
States. He said: 
The English adult class is primarily a Bible class for workingmen, i. e., a mission 
class held generally early on First-day morning, taught by some man of good edu- 
cation and standing, but self-governed and essentially cooperative or democratic 
initsforms. There are also women’s classes taught by women, and imixed classes. 
This bold and simple description is almost all that can be said to be universally 
true about these schools, for variety is of their essence, and elasticity is the only 
tule of their practice. There is also only one marked characteristic of the spirit 
of them all, and that is brotherliness. * * * There are many imperfect teach- 
ers, speaking intellectually, among us, but there is one invariable and necessary 
characteristic of the successful worker, and that is an easy manner, a ready hand- 
shake, and a friendly, affable way with you. * * * Almost every additional 
quality that we may possess comes in useful, for the schools have developed in all 
sorts of directions from the original Bible class. There are savings banks, libra- 
ries, sick funds, Saturday afternoon rambles, holidays away together in the sum- 
mer, fishing clubs, football clubs, microscopic clubs. There are tea parties and 
social evenings and debating societies. In some cases there are prayer meetings, 
mission meetings, and temperance meetings. There is everything that the coop- 
erative spirit of man can devise for his comfort when once he gets into friendly 
relations with his fellows. * * * 
Originally the movement, when begun fifty years ago, dealt with the most 
degraded men who could be found. Reading and writing were the bribe held out 
to those who would consent to come to the Scripture lesson, but we have now had 
in England nearly a generation of complete public schools, and reading and writ- 
ing are dropped as no longer needed. 
In my own class we do not confine ourselves to the Bible for subjects. We 
utilize all that is excellent and of good report. There is nothing I am personally 
so fond of as going exegetically through an epistle of Paul. We once spent four 
years over the life of Jesus. We treat all biblical matters with the best knowl- 
edge we can obtain from biblical critics. We have had lessons on Buddhism and 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Mohammedanism, on the lives of many great men, recently on Mazzini and John 
Woolman, and on current moral and social questions. * * * Iam accustomed 
to give a lesson for half an hour to discussion, and lively times we have * * * 
but evincing thought and interest, and capable after all contradictions of being 
judiciously guided to an amicable settlement. * * * We conclude with a 
short devotional pause. 
He stated that in Birmingham 10,000 men—4,000 in the Friends’ 
schools, from which the others have copied—gathered at from 7 to 
8.50 a. m. for their schools. 
Other classes are quite different from myown. They are often extremely evan- 
gelical in tone, and inquiry is not tolerated out of the beaten track. In fact, every 
teacher does what he thinks is right, and attracts his own sort of men, 
In reply to a question whether the Friends in England had First- 
day schools among their own members, Mr. Graham said: 
We rely entirely upon home teaching for that. We have none whatever. 
At an evening meeting in the Friends’ religious conference Mr. 
Graham spoke upon ‘‘Three needs.of the church.” 
I. * * * The need of consecration to aggressive work. * * * 
Il. * .* .* The service of the ministry. * * * 
Ill. * * * There is not enough living, modern knowledge of the Bible among 
your ministry asitis. * * * 
I therefore plead with you to read the Bible more and study it more. In Eng- 
land we Friends all read it twice a day in our families, and at our schools we 
learn off quite a considerable fraction of the New Testament. 
He commended the attention given to biblical study in the original 
languages at Bryn Mawr College (orthodox) and urged its adoption at 
Swarthmore (Hicksite) as an aid to general biblical education and 
influence upon First-day schools.

INTERNATIONAL SUNDAY SCHOOL CONVENTION. 
  The International Sunday School Convention includes in its statis- 
ties what are called Protestant and Evangelical schools. Although 
certain denominations are strongly represented in the convention, it 
would hardly be strictly correct to say that they were all officially 
represented. It occurs that Sunday schools and local associations of 
Sunday schools send delegates to the international convention, and 
that the authorities of some denominations so far follow the decisions 
of the convention as to use its Scripture selections for lessons, but 
individual denominations, or special interests within a denomination, 
put forth their own lesson helps or comments, and many schools and 
some denominations pay small heed to the lesson schemes marked 
out by the international committee. 
The statistics already given are presumably included in the table 
put forth by the Kighth International Sunday School Convention, as 
are also the facts regarding some denominations that have not been 
available in separate form. The international reports of the Sunday 
schools are made up for areas, as towns, cities, counties, States, and 
it is not easy to determine just what was included in each case. 
In pages immediately fcllowing are given extracts from the pro- 
ceedings of the Eighth International Sunday School Convention, 
Boston, Mass., June 23-26, 1896, indicating something of the views 
presented and the decisions of the association. 
George C. Lorimer, D. D., Boston, Mass., in the course of an
-P-A-G-E-475
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 895 
  extended address, plead for more definite study of the Bible itself, 
saying: . 
I don’t think any teacher has the right to take before his Sunday school class a 
“lesson help” of any shape or kind. I have been pained when during the past 
winter I have visited many Sunday schools to see so many teachers standing with 
the Bible shut and a lesson paper on the back of it, trying to teach the class. You 
are thereby missing the prime object of the Sunday school, which is not to teach 
the specific opinions stated in a Sunday school helper, but is to inspire the youth 
with the profoundest reverence for the Word of God. 
Another thing I have noticed. Apart from the use of helps in such classes, how 
little effort was made, is being made, to memorize the Word of God. * * * 
Born an Episcopalian and bred an Episcopalian, from that I drifted into a Bap- 
tist Sunday school. I believe that my whole future was determined by that Sun- 
day school. And why? First of all we were taught, and especially taught, to 
memorize God’s Word. You know that what comes to you in early life, almost 
unconsciously, will color your actions afterwards. I studied, I memorized and 
repeated, and I could repeat to-day the whole Gospel of St. John from the begin- 
ning to the end. I won a prize on the Psalms of David, and all the critics of the 
world, somehow, can not convince me that David did not write the Psalms. 
William Reynolds, field superintendent, outlined the work of the 
international organization, making the following statements regarding 
its work in this country: 
The teaching of God’s Word is left almost entirely to the Sunday school. Com- 
paratively little is done in Christian homes, and none in our public schools or 
other secular educational institutions. If, therefore, the children and youth of 
this present generation are to be “rooted and grounded” in God's Word, it must 
be in the Sabbath schools of our land. Hence the necessity of better schools, bet- 
ter facilities, better management, and better teaching. * * * 
Factors in the improvement.—i. Perfected organization. In order that improved 
methods may be made known to the schools and workers, it is necessary that a 
complete chain of organization be maintained from the international committee 
to the individual teacher. Therefore we have this international meeting every 
three years, composed of delegates from each State. * * * Once a year we 
have the State * * * convention, composed of delegates from each county in 
the State or province. Next comes the county convention, composed of delegates 
from each township or district in the county. And last we have the township con- 
vention, that embraces every Sunday school officer and teacher within its bound- 
ary. The township overlooks the work in its limits, the county in its entirety, 
and the State in its domain. The international organization is the watchtower, 
from which we overlook the whole field. 
2. Normal classes. A great advance has been made in the widespread establish- 
mentof normal classes for training and developing better teachers. No permanent 
improvement can be madein our schools until our teaching reaches a higher stand- 
ard and we copy more closely the one Model Teacher. Never man taught like

tional system of lessons was introduced twenty-four yearsago, * * *
-P-A-G-E-476

  7. Publications. Perhaps no factor has done more for our work along all lines 
than the deyelopment and increase of publications devoted exclusively to Sunday- 
school work. We refer with pride and gratitude to the two leading publications, 
the International Evangel and the Sunday-School Times. * * *

  SUNDAY SCHOOLS.. 397 
8. B. Capen, president of the convention, defined the work of the 
Sunday school thus: 
Let me say, first, that next to the home the Sunday school is the mightiest force 
for righteousness in our land, because it is touching most effectively the young 
life of the nation. * * * 
It has been said that the teachings of what was commonly called the “‘ three R’s— 
Reading, ’Riting, ’Rithmetic—is not enough; there must bea fourth R, Righteous- 
ness,” and this is the special mission of the Sunday school. 
H. M. Hamill, field worker, reported of work in the South. The 
imperfection of records which he names is not peculiar to the South. 
He said in the course of his report: 
There are many signs of advance along the lines of the most approved and mod- 
ern Sunday-school work. City Sunday-school unions are springing up in the 
larger cities. * * * The best modern Sunday-school architecture is being intro- 
duced. Conveniently constructed and equipped Sunday-school buildings are tak- 
ing the place of the old. * * * Maps, blackboards, charts, the best appliances 
and literature are in demand. The grading and classification of schools, their 
better management, the training of teachers, are chief topics of the Southern 
Sunday-school publications. * * * 
The statistical reports of the Southern Sunday-school work, I am sure, are 
imperfect and incomplete. The fault is not with the workers, but with the con- 
dition of the work, which, with rare exceptions, has not reached that stage of 
progress that secures full and complete statistical exhibits. There is such alarge, 
unorganized, and undrilled territory in the South that a just exhibit of its real 
Sunday-school strength will for years to come be lacking. If the figures of the. 
denominational boards and secretaries could be secured, it would give a truer 
statement than we now have from the meager returns of the State and county 
officers. The relative strength of the white and black Sunday-school enrollment 
and of that larger element not counted of both whites and blacks is an unknown 
quantity in most of the Southern States. Iam sure that the present estimates do 
not give justice to the real statistical status of the South, * * * 
The most serious problem of Southern Sunday-school work is the problem of the 
blacks. How many millions of these are in or out of Sunday schools no man 
knows, but in the answer to that question every man North and South is vitally 
interested. The known conditions are ground for our most serious and anxious 
thought. I do not believe that this problem, with all that is involved in it, can be 
clearly understood except by those whom it most immediately concerns and by 
those who in the spirit of Christ are looking upon it face to face. I believe that 
the Southern people, especially the Southern white churches, have been mis- 
understood, and that there is a far kinder feeling between the two races and a 
stronger desire to aid in the solution of the problem than is commonly supposed 
to exist. I believe that there are many thousands in the South whose cradles, 
like my own, were rocked by the hands of slaves who look upon the black man 
with genuine sympathy and brotherly love and would gladly aid in any movement 
that would open the doors of the gospel tohim and his children. Already astrong 
movement on the part of the white churches of the South has begun, and is daily 
gaining strength. But the harvest is great and the laborers far too few. The 
white churches for most of the generation that has passed since the war have been 
battling against their own poverty, and could not carry forward the great and 
needed work among the blacks. The blacks are waiting to beled. One of the 
pathetic sights of the Southland to me is the universal desire of the blacks to have 
churches and Sunday schools for themselves and their little ones. After five

years of international service in the South and a thorough acquaintance with the 
white and black leaders, [am justified in saying that the white Christians are anx- 
ious to help in the evangelization of the negro. 
  B. F. Jacobs, as chairman of the executive committee, said: 
A resolution was adopted expressing strong preference for one lesson only for 
the whole school, with a suggestion to the lesson committee as to an optional 
course for primary classes if the lesson committee decide to try the plan. * oe 
Field workers, missionaries, and secretaries are now employed in twenty-three 
States and the District of Columbia. * * * 
Confessedly, our greatest need to-day is qualified teachers of little children. 
The kindergarten movement is gathering force and old methods of teaching are 
giving place to new. This must be true in Sunday-school work, and our primary- 
class teachers are now the most importunate pleaders for help. In six States and 
one province a qualified primary teacher is now employed as a State worker, and 
primary unions are being formed in our cities and larger towns. In New Jersey 
a ten days’ institute for primary-class workers was attended by 175 persons, and 
the plans for this year cover twenty days, and an attendance of 300 is expected. 
The total number of primary unions reported is 102, as follows: In California, 1; 
Colorado, 2; Connecticut, 2; District of Columbia, 1; Illinois, 2; Indiana, 1; ee 
tucky, 6; Maine, 3; Massachusetts, 24; Michigan, 1; Minnesota, 2; Missouri, 7; New 
Jersey, 15; New York, 8; Ohio, 6; Oregon, 1; Pennsylvania, 16; South Carolina, 1; 
Tennessee, 1; Wisconsin, 1, Wyoming, 1. * * * 
The International Sunday-school lessons.—This convention has a most important 
work to do. It will choose a new lesson committee who are [to select the lessons 
which are to be studied during the closing years of this century and the first five 
-years of the twentieth century. It is probable that changes will occur in the 
committee, and it is almost certain that the plan will be continued. The agita- 
tion of the question and opposition to the plan has failed to remove it from the 
place it has long occupied in the minds and hearts of Sunday-school workers. 
Even the urgent demand upon the part of the few for a separate course for the 
primary department has less support now than it had a year or two ago. 
  John Wanamaker made strong claims for the preeminent office of 
the Sunday school: 
The influence exercised by the Sunday school, where it has had proper develop- 
ment, has been so beneficial and far-reaching that, over and above any other 
religious agency, itis believed by many to come the nearest to answering the 
greatest need of the human race at the present hour. For the reason, first, that 
no other school exists which is conducted systematically and continuously for 
teaching the one Book containing God’s revelation of himself and the ‘rule for His 
children’s lives. Second, itis the only school organized to teach the Bible at the 
most teachable age; to inform the mind, influence the heart, and mold the life 
in the highest principles of unselfishness and uprightness in the fear of God and 
love for our fellow-men. * * * 
Since the uniform lessons were introduced, with the accompanying literature 
upon lessons and management, the past twenty years have registered fifty years’ 
growth by the advance that has been made in perfecting the system. * * * 
It is not a fad or fashion, the plaything of unemployed laymen or the pastime 
of leisure-blest women. It is not independent of, but an approved agency of the 
universal church, sanctioned by the highest church courts and under the control of 
pastors, rectors, elders, deacons, and vestries. Neither is it a mere incident of the 
church. It often exists on the outskirts of cities where there is no church, and in 
all new regions invariably precedes the establishment of the church.
-P-A-G-E-479
SUNDAY SCHOOLS.” 399 
In the newer States of this country the Sunday school is frequently tie pioneer 
of the settlement, the only social center in the township, the only public moral 
center, providing the only library in the neighborhood, the only book center, the 
only music center, the only post-office distributing generally any printed matter, 
the mother of the church. Few can ever know how large a part the little cross- 
roads Sunday school had in allaying the discontents and loneliness of the first 
homes of the early settlers. In the cities it must not be supposed that the excel- 
lent college settlement work of the present time isa newdiscovery. It is only the 
old mission Sunday school under amew name, The old-time mission schools did 
precisely the same kind of work throughout the week days as the college settle- 
ments, with the teaching of the Bible on Sundays in addition. 
Rey. C. R. Blackall, a writer of Sunday-school lessons, said: 
It must be admitted that the Sunday school has not kept up the standards of - 
pedagogics that are certainly essential to the best success. The work being vol- 
untary, the teaching material in great part untrained and inefficient and the limi- 
tations and hindrances numerous, the results are not what they might be under 
amore favorable conditions. 
  The report of the lesson committee, Warren Randolph, D. D., chair- 
man, shows that— 
In 1872 began the system of uniform international lessons, arranged first in 
courses requiring seven years and in 1893 to require six years. In 1893 there was 
an emphatic expression of the convention for ‘one lesson for all.” There had 
never been a divided opinion in the lesson committee as to the wisdom of the plan 
of uniformity adopted at the beginning, and they felt confirmed by the vote of the 
convention; but in 1894, when that committee met, they were embarrassed by an ~ 
earnest appeal from influential workers for a separate course of lessons for pri- 
mary classes. The committee still judging a uniform course best, was willing to 
try to meet the wishes expressed, and prepared aspecial primary lesson list, which 
they submitted for instructions. They also submitted the question of a special 
temperance lesson quarterly. 
The next two speakers condemned current methods, Mr. Patterson 
Dubois saying that ‘‘ the secular school is ahead” of the Sunday school 
in its recognition of “‘the germinal fact of the child as the primary 
principle,” and Margaret C. Brown pleading for conformity in the 
Sunday schools to the principles of Froebel. 
W. D. Pearce said: 
Three of the greatest hindrances to Sunday-school management are: (1) Lack 
of regular and punctual attendance; (2) lack of lesson preparation; (3) lack of 
systematic giving. 
Nehemiah Boynton, D. D., said: 
The one thought which * * * I wish to lay upon your minds and hearts 
here and now is this, that the essential of a Sunday-school teacher after all is 
simply spiritual preparation. It is magnificent to have all the equipments with 
which to do our Sunday-school work. * * * It is splendid to be an accom- 
plished student in the work of God, to understand all the niceties of that magnifi- 
cent book, to see the continuity of history springing in Genesis and finding its 
splendid culmination over in the Book of Revelation. But there is something 
better than that. The teacher who has the equipment and the teacher who has 
the knowledge, but who has not the spiritual preparation in his own life and the 
spiritual aspiration in his own soul, will never lead the boys and girls very near to 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  the beautiful gates, with all his magnificent equipment and with all his marvelous 
erudition. Now, that is a thought of greatcomfort for those of us, who as Sunday- 
school teachers realize our defects and deficiencies as we come to our boys and 
girls. It is a great comfort to us to understand that we can be great and towering 
in our Christian success if only we will school and discipline and develop our own 
lives according to the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. Fora 
great Christian will be a great Sunday-school teacher, even though that Christian 
be unable to read or to know the letters of the alphabet, because that Christian 
will have the practical experience out of which to develop the souls put into his 
care and keeping. 
The following was among recommendations adopted, as was also 
the resolution succeeding: 
That as the crying need of our Sunday schools is trained teachers we strongly 
urge weekly meetings in each school for the study of the lesson; institutes for 
groups of schools for the study of the Bible and of methods of instruction; that 
in our colleges and seminaries special courses in Bible study and teacher training 
be provided for the ministers and Christian workers of the church as vital to this 
“progress, and that we approve of the recognition of all graduates in a normal 
course of study by the State and provincial associations. * * * 
Resolved, That this convention reaffirms its belief in the uniform system of 
international lessons as the best yet devised, and hereby pledges its loyal support. 
The statements of speakers at the Boston convention regarding the 
imperfection of records, for instance those of Mr. Hamill, are to be 
kept in mind in estimating the value of the tables. In this matter, as 
in many others of public report, the original records are defective, 
and no compiler can bring together a series of ultimate accuracy, 
since so much of the foundation is only estimate. In the statement 
of attendance put forth by the association the individual responsible 
for each State report is named, and the dependence one can place in 
each case can be judged by those best acquainted with the conditions 
in that case. 
With the limitations mentioned, the following table represents the 
numerical strength of the Sunday school of Protestant Evangelical 
connection recognized by the International Sunday School Con- 
vention.*

  THE HOME DEPARTMENT, SUNDAY SCHOOLS.           It would not be safe to say that no Sunday schools return those in 
the home department in their general statistics of attendance, but it 
is so far customary to report the home department separately that it 
represents a large addition to the work done in the Sunday-school 
rooms. 
The home work is reported to be especially important in its results 
in the South, opening up an additional opportunity for education and 
developing family influences in a rapidly increasing degree. In 
recent addresses, Rev. L. B. Maxwell, agent of the International 
Association for work among the negroes, has pointed out that when 
adults have pledged themselves to study the lesson for at least thirty 
minutes each week their interest leads them to spend more time, and 
that where the parents interested can not read they have their chil- 
dren read to them, so that whole families study together, the children 
meantime gaining in general training. The system of visitors also 
develops social life in a wholesome way, so that there is a building 
up of higher civilization. This forms one of the bright spots in a 
work that in the nation at large is open to much criticism. 
The method of management and the enrollment are taken from the 
report made by W. A. Duncan, Ph. D., at the Eighth International 
Sunday School Convention (1896), as follows: 
            
        
                                                 
  Methods and organization.—The method of operation is that of the University 
Extension movement and the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, for in 
both of these credit is given for work done away from college or schoolroom, 
whether it be accomplished by individuals or in class work. One of the first 
things to do is to look over your church roll and mark every person who does not 
attend your Bible school. Then take the list of scholars and see how many of 
their parents are not members of the church or of the school. Then make a com. 
plete canvass of the whole parish, neighborhood, or town, especially of the chil- 
dren of school age, between 5 and 21, first urging every one as you make the canvass 
to attend the main school. Then revise and combine these lists into one, and this 
will be your field for introducing the study of the Bible into the home. After you 
have made out this list call together those you think will be interested in estab-   
-P-A-G-E-484
   
   404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  lishing a home department. Then select ten or twenty active workers, call them 
together in your study and talk the matter over, and show them the number of 
persons who are not studying the Bible. Say to one, for example, ‘‘ Here are ten 
people living in your neighborhood. Will you take care of them?’ She agrees 
to do so, and you assign another ten to a second worker, and another to a third, 
and so on, until you have portioned out the one hundred and fifty or more people 
who are not studying the Bible systematically. You call these fifteen or twenty 
people your visitors. These visitors go to the people with a pledge card, on which 
is printed: ‘‘I promise to study the regular Sunday-school lesson half an hour 
each week.” These cards are signed, and the names are enroiled as members of 
your school, each visitor and her students constituting a class. You may use the 
card or not; you may send these visitors out to explain the system by word of 
mouth, or you may have a little circular printed. After securing the members 
send for your extra Sunday-school quarterlies, then call your visitors together 
and divide the quarterlies among them, giving in connection with each a record 
card or envelope on which every student can keep the record of lesson study and 
contributions for three months. 
The visitors go out with these quarterlies and record cards about the 25th of 
December, leaving them in the various homes. Then about the 25th of March 
they go out again and gather up the record cards, leaving new quarterlies and 
cards, speaking a word of encouragement, and seeking to remove any hindrances 
or difficulties that may exist. These records are brought back to the secretary of 
your Sunday school and he enters them in the secretary’s book. 
The home department should not be made a separate organization, but should 
be considered as holding the same relation to the Sunday school as the primary or 
intermediate departments. At the end of the next quarter do the same thing. 
Some will fall out, others will join; but persist in the work. Let the pastor preach 
asermon on the subject; use your library; let the department be recognized in 
your prayer meeting; let it bean essential part of your work; persist in it and you 
will find that the results will pay. * * *

  SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 405. 
HEBREW SABBATH SCHOOLS. 
No matter what may be one’s personal religious views, he can not 
properly study the full subject of Sunday schools if he does not exam- 
ine them on the broad basis of their community of avowed religious 
purpose. Every organization based on religious convictions must 
maintain itself in accord with mental and moral laws. Whatever 
differences of private opinion may exist, every successful teacher 
must have a quality ora method that has some interest to other per- 
sons interested in education. This will require the study of schools 
not included in the statistics of the International Sunday School 
Association, namely, those of the Roman Catholics, the Unitarians, 
the Latter Day Saints, all accepting the same Bible as a sacred book; 
those of the Hebrews, who accept the Old Testament only, and those 
of some minor bodies, not at this date available, whenever their con- 
ditions are evident. 
The reports of Hebrew Sabbath schools may be studied to great 
advantage, especially if one will observe how far they would apply 
were the word ‘‘ Hebrew” dropped and the name of any other group 
that uses the Hebrew scriptures substituted. 
The information as to Hebrew Sabbath schools in this country has 
been partly obtained through the courtesy of Dr. David Philipson, 
president of the Hebrew Sabbath School Union of America. Returns 
are not regarded as complete, many schools failing to reply when 
the figures were collected, which was in 1889. The published reports ~ 
of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations have been freely 
utilized. 
The schools have sessions on Sunday morning from 9 o’clock to 11 
or 11.30. Some have an additional session on Saturday from 9 to 10 
a.m. The rabbi is the superintendent. Where there is no rabbi, as 
is the case in some very small congregations, a layman has charge 
of the school. In quite a number of congregations there are what are 
known as post-communion classes, consisting of the young people who 
have been confirmed, usually under the personal charge of the rabbi. 
It is not easy to make an accurate statement regarding the Jews in 
this country. There are many Jews not identified with any congre- 
gation. Each congregation is a voluntary association governed by its 
own rules and responsible to no other except through its own pledges. 
In 1872 Jews at Cincinnati made an effort ‘‘ with a view to form a 
union of congregations, the object of which should be: First, to estab- 
lish a Jewish theological faculty; second, to publish proper books for 
our Sabbath schools; third, to adopt a code of laws defining Judaism.” 
The following was published under date of May 18, 1873, in the Jewish 
papers of Cincinnati: 
Owing to the difficulty experienced in obtaining the names of the numerous 
congregations in the West and South, the committee has been unable to address 
the call to all whom it was desired to reach, We therefore republish it, and trug
-P-A-G-E-486
  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
that each Jewish congregation, from the Alleghanies to the Pacific and from the 
Lakes to the Gulf, will consider the call hereunto annexed as if directed to itself, 
and all those who have not done so will respond by electing delegates in accord- 
ance therewith at as early a day as possible. 
The committee charged with the call had been able to obtain the 
address and location of about one hundred congregations. Out of 
this movement grew the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; 
the organization of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
embracing three departments, viz, preparatory, Hebrew classical, and 
Rabbinical; and the Hebrew Sabbath School Union. To enter the 
schools preparatory to the college, one must be a student or graduate 
of a high school or college; for the Hebrew classical, the candidate 
must be a graduate of the preparatory or a student of a high school 
or college, and in the rabbinical department the candidate must be a 
graduate of the Hebrew classical and of a university or college. The 
graduates of the last department receive the degree of doctor of divin- 
ity as qualified for the ministry. Prizes were offered for the best 
biblical history, the best post-biblical history, and the best catechism, 
to make the Sabbath school work more efficient. 
The scope of the organization was extended by a resolution to 
“invite every Hebrew congregation in the United States and its Ter- 
ritories to join the union.” So much was initiated before 1875. At 
the meeting of 1875 the president of the council delivered an address, 
in which he said: 
The fundamental cause of all misfortune, be it individual, in the family, the 
State, or the nation, can be directly traced to disregard of the ten command- 
ments. The ten commandments are to human affairs what dew, rain, and sun- 
shine are to the vegetable kingdom, * * * 
There aresigns * * * that Israel is growing careless of its religion. The 
young men are not joining the congregations. Perhaps it is because the old are 
beginning to disregard the Sabbath as a day of rest, as a day devoted to God and 
the family, divinely given for mental elevation and advancement. 
This second council initiated a supply of a translation of the Hebrew 
Seriptures, the Old Testament of the Christian, so that they might be 
sold at a low uniform price in all congregations. This translation is 
known as Leeser’s Bible, from Isaac Leeser, the translator. 
At the third council (1876) the Biblical History of Rev. D. T. 
Deutsch, of Hartford, Conn., was recommended as the best existing 
text-book of its kind. A book written in the German language was 
recommended as the best text-book for post-biblical history, namely, 
Dr. Cassel’s Leitfaden fiir den Unterricht in der Jiidischen Geschichte. 
The following statement is abbreviated from the constitution as 
revised in 1878: 
It is the primary object of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations to 
establish a Hebrew theological institute; * * * to establish, sustain, and 
govern a seat of learning for Jewish religion and literature; to provide for and
-P-A-G-E-487
  SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 407 
advance the standard of Sabbath schools for the instruction of the young in 
Israel’s religion and etary. and the Hebrew language; to aid and encourage 
young congregations; * to provide, sustain, and manage such other insti- 
tutions which the common welfare and progress of Judaism shall require—with- 
out, however, interfering in any manner whatsoever with the affairs and 
management of any congregation. 
  In 1878 a prize was offered for the best hymn book for Sabbath 
schools. 
As the culmination of an effort pursued acaes the previous two 
years to collect statistics, the report of 1878 shows 223 congregations, 
12,030 members (heads of families, apparently), and 12,674 scholars 
receiving religious instruction under 652 teachers. The number of 
Jews residing in the United States so far as heard from reached 
227,528, and it was estimated that 250,000 would include the whole 
Jewish population. 
There had been an organization known as the Board of Delegates 
of American Israelites. A noteworthy incident of the sixth council 
of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (1879) was the merg- 
ing of the board of delegates in the union and the presentation of a 
statistical report whose summary varied little from that of the previ- 
ous year. The following extracts are from the proceedings of this 
_ (sixth) council: 
Tuition in the Hebrew Union College is free to all, without religious test and 
without registering fees. The hours of tuition are from 4 to 6 p. m. daily, which 
will not interfere with the secular studies, they being from 8 a. m. until 2 p.m. 
Gale ea 
The branches of study comprise— 
(1) The Bible in the original; the Targumim, and the most important commen- 
taries. 
(2) Tradition: (a) The Talmud; (b) Midrash; (c) Casuistic literature. 
(8) History of Israel, its doctrines and customs. 
(4) Jewish religious philosophy. 
(5) Homiletics: Instruction in the conduct of public divine services. 
(6) Hebrew and Aramaic grammar. 
(7) German language and literature, in case the students have not the requisite 
facilities to pursue this part of their studies elsewhere. 
(8) Art of teaching (pedagogics), with especial reference to the congregational 
schools for religious instruction. 
Nore.—The study of the secular branches shall be regulated by tee faculty in 
accordance with the local school systems and opportunities. * * 
The fifth year is intended for such students as shall have eae completed 
their course of study at one of the colleges or universities of the country, and 
thus shall be able to devote their whole time to the studies in the Rabbinical Col- 
lege. The hours of instruction shall be thirty a week. 
In 1877 the Emanu-El Preparatory School of the Theological Semi- 
nary was organized in New York City. In 1879 there were three 
classes—6, 20, and 9 members, respectively; the sessions were Sunday 
mornings, 10 to 12; Wednesday afternoon, 4 to 6; Saturday afternoon, 
3to5. Tuition free to all wishing to attend.

  408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  In 1885 a circular was issued to each Jewish minister whose address 
was attainable covering the inquiry— 
What measures seem to you practicable to assure to the rising generation of 
Jews such Jewish teaching as will more surely tend to create in them an active 
interest in Jewish affairs and an earnest participation in the intellectual and 
moral life of the Jewish community. 
The replies deserve study for their treatment of general principles 
as well as for the information they contain as to the special conditions 
and needs of Jews. Only exceedingly abbreviated citations can be 
given here. Dr. Solomon Eppinger, Cincinnati, laments— 
That in this country not only most of the youth, but a great portion of the older 
Jews, do not care much about Judaism and Jewish affairs. 
As causes “‘of this unhealthy condition” he notes the freedom 
which many Jewish immigrants assume to extend to religion, only 
desiring to make money and be buried in a Jewish burying place; the 
clinging to ceremonies by certain others without conception of the real 
object of religion; the disposition of some to avoid being known as 
Jews for social or commercial reasons. 
The consequence of all this is that in the families of such so-called Jews every 
trace of Judaism is avoided and the children grow up without any education in 
religion; and even if such children should be sent toa Jewish Sabbath school, 
what support would the teaching of the school find in the family? And yet in 
regard to the teaching of religion, as in many other matters, the house is the prin- 
cipal place where the culture of the heart begins and must be mainly sustained. 
Rey. I. Epstein, St. Louis, writes in a degree like Dr. Eppinger: 
1. It is, I think, generally conceded that the religious training the child receives 
in early years at home is the basis of all subsequent improvement by teachers of 
the Sabbath school, self-instruction, and intercourse with the companions in later 
years, * * * The mothers in Israel must be awakened to a sense of responsi- 
bility in order that they may see the necessity of reestablishing a true Jewish home 
by their own pious example, observance of Sabbath and holy days, prayers, etc., 
but, above all, by instilling into the tender hearts of their dear children the prin- 
ciples of truth, virtue, and morality. 
2. The teachers employed at our Sabbath schools must be in every respect, both 
intellectually and morally, competent to teach the Jewish religion. * * * 
8. There must be more time given to the religious education of the Jewish 
youth. An hour on Sabbath morning and two hours on Sunday will not suffice to 
teach Hebrew, catechism, and biblical or post-biblical history. 
Rev. Dr. J. 8. Goldammer, Nashville, Tenn., responded: 
The measure to assure such Jewish teachings is simply the Jewish teaching as 
laid down in that glorious old Book of Books, in the six verses of the sixth book of 
Deuteronomy, where it is said, ‘‘ Thou shalt teach them thy children.” * * * 
Religious education is the only practicable measure to assure that teaching 
which you desire for the rising generation. This measure, I am sorry to say, is 
entirely out of use at the present. The parents of the present generation havo 
dropped it, and I know of no other measure abie to substitute it. * * * 
We are living in a materialistic age, in which mammon is the supreme power, 
the business place the temple, and pleasure-seeking the worship. * * *
-P-A-G-E-489
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 409 
  This condition of affairs, however, was not brought about by the rising genera- 
tion, but by the raising generation. * * * 
Let the old folks manifest actually their thoughts of God and their religious 
feeling by those forms adopted by modern reform, and the young folks will emu- 
latively follow in their wake. Let the raising generation pray and worship God 
in the vernacular of the country, reverently; * * * let them keep holy the Sab- 
bath day and go into the house of God, father and mother, and take their chil- 
dren by the hand as they do when they go into places of amusement; let them 
begin to train their children in Israel’s pure religion. * * * Let the ministers 
preach not only rational and philosophical, but preeminently Scriptural sermons, 
and let the Sabbath schools be conducted so as to impress more their heart than 
their brain. 
Rey. Henry Iliowizi, Minneapolis, Minn., convinced ‘‘that the 
plague of American Israel is ignorance, or, at best, half*-knowledge,” 
favors, first, ‘‘a more thorough instruction in Jewish history;” sec- 
ond, ‘‘a rational interpretation of the miraculous events in our Scrip- 
tures,” and ‘‘a good Jewish weekly or monthly for the young.” 
Nearly all the respondents lay emphasis on home training as funda- 
mental, but Jacobs Jacobson, of Atlanta, Ga., says: 
Wherever our youth are lax in their participation in religious affairs, I think 
the rabbis first and the parents next are to be blamed. 
Rey. 8. Mannheimer, Cincinnati, Ohio, mentions two things as— 
essential to revive and reawaken the spirit that animated the generation of the 
past. A synod (or call it conference, convention) must establish a common plat- 
form for American Judaism. * * * 
The second essential point is the celebration of the weekly Sabbath. * * * 
All our measures to arouse the spirit of the young generation are in vain if we 
show them by our example that lucre and gain have more power over us than the 
dictates of our religion. What beneficent results can we expect from the teachings 
of the school and the pupil if they are at variance with the practices of life. 
The next quotation, from the same speaker, is to be interpreted as 
summing up a statement, including a condemnation of whimsical, 
capricious, and sensational aberrations in the pulpits, for which he 
blames such congregations as allow and encourage them: 
Uniformity of divine service, in which, like in former times, old and young 
must take an active part, and a more general observance of the Sabbath. These 
are, according to my humble opinion, the two essential requisites for the mainte- 
nance of Judaism. Without these two mainstays, all other devices and measures 
will only be palliatives that may for a while mitigate the evil, but will not cure it. 
Rev. Dr. Messing, Indianapolis, Ind., says: 
The cause of the decline of religious sentiment among our rising youth is to be 
traced mainly to the want of religious practices in our homes. The utter neglect 
of our modern Jewish parents to heed that admonition of the wise King (Proverbs 
xxii,6), * * * ‘Train up the lad in accordance with his course; even when 
he groweth old will he not depart from it,’’ seems to me to be the root of this great 
evil. There may hardly be 10 per cent of Jewish family circles where a-word of 
prayer is yet heard or a religious ceremony yet practiced. The synagogue and 
Sabbath school can only cooperate with home religious influence and example. 
As long as our home life remains void of these, I can see no remedy against and 
no hindrance for the further decline of religious sentiment among our rising 
youths.
-P-A-G-E-490
410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-97. 
Rey. Dr. M. Mielziner, Cincinnati, Ohio, says: 
The principal agents for such training and education are: 
(1) The parental home. 
(2) The Sabbath school. 
(3) The synagogue or temple. 
Dr. Mielziner’s reply occupies 4 octavo pages, but at the risk of 
inadequate expression of his suggestions, the extracts must be only 
those which most relate directly to Sunday-school work, or to the 
training of the youth. He says: 
In the first place, I have to point to home training. * * * In doing away 
with obsolete forms and ceremonials of domestic life, many parents have, at the 
same time, banished from their homes every religious practice, every prayer and 
devotion. The children grow up without their hearts and minds ever being 
touched by religious thought and feeling, and without seeing and hearing any- 
thing that reminds them of their allegiance to God and Israel. 
The few weekly hours which such children later spend in the Sabbath school 
can not make up for the neglect of their religious home training. * * * 
Regarding our Sabbath schools, I beg leave to notice that many of them labor 
under the great disadvantage of having no teachers thoroughly prepared. * * * 
Another defect connected with our Sabbath schools is the early age at which the 
children are considered absolved from the obligation of attending such schools. 
After having gone through the solemn and highly important act of confirmation 
at the average age of 18 to 14, they quit the Sabbath school, and with it all further 
religious instruction, The religious knowledge which they acquired is, even in 
the best case, elementary only. * * * The divine service is either entirely neg- 
lected by them, as their parents fail to show them a good example, or if they do 
attend they remain but passive lookers on, as our mode of worship fails to invite 
their participation in congregational song and devotion, and their intellect is not 
yet ripe enough to be interested in and benefited by the lectures from the pulpit. 
  Dr. Mielziner would organize normal classes to prepare teachers for 
higher branches of religious instruction, especially English Bible read- 
ing with explanations and post-biblical history. For those above 17 
years of age he would extend the organization and educational work 
of young men’s Hebrew associations and increase the publication of 
the treasures of Jewish literature in English in agreeable form. 
Rey. Dr. Samuel Hirsch, Philadelphia, Pa., feels ‘‘deeply aggrieved 
at the wording of the circular which pertained to ‘the rising genera- 
tion of Jews,’” and says: 
As long as it is proclaimed religion is for others, for the rising gexeration, I see 
no hope. The rising generation imagines itself as wise, if not wiser, than the 
grown-up people, and if grown-up people do not need spiritual food, should they 
need it? 
Rey. Dr. Voorsanger, Houston, Tex., is like Dr. Hirsch in locating 
the trouble: 
What, I ask you, should induce the children to be better than the parents? I 
tell you we are going too far in accusing our youth. We should accuse our- 
aebues. * * * 
To summarize: Our youth can be saved and recovered by— 
(1) The example of the elders.
-P-A-G-E-491
  
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 411 
(2) The induction and application of a positive religion. 
(8) The reorganization of worship upon a more distinctly Jewish basis. 
(4) By making the Sabbath school the most important organization in the coun- 
try, instead of the siindenbock ' to be kicked by everybody. 
Rey. D. H. Zirndorf speaks of the work of the home and the exem- 
plary lives of adults. Of the principal drawbacks to the Sabbath 
school, he says: 
(a) They are only Sabbath and Sunday schools, with other words, the insuffi- 
ciency of the time; (b) their half-and-half character, hemming them in between 
day school and domestic dolce far niente, between a Christian Bible class anda 
laborious Jewish training class; (¢c) the comparative insufficiency of the text-books; 
(d) the inadequateness of the teaching staff, composed in smaller congregations 
especially, but as it happens in larger towns likewise, mostly from volunteers, not 
less well intended than they are ignorant and unsystematic. It speaks for itself 
that the standard of Jewish knowledge becomes daily more and more lowered; 
(e) the want ofa discipline ably sustained and enforced; (f) the inadequate action 
or inactivity (as it may be) of administrative boards and the oratorical posing of 
the usual spokesmen of each respective congregation. 
To remedy these evils is at present almost impossible. I offer the following 
suggestions for consideration: (a) It is chimerical to think of a uniform teaching 
method; (b) the publication of good text-books is to be encouraged by prizes; (¢) 
poorer congregations should receive financial aid from the union; (d) school 
libraries should be established; (e) the scanty time should not be squandered 
away by too much singing exercise or recitation of poems; (f) professional and 
salaried teachers should, wherever feasible, be appointed. 
In 1886 a Sabbath school convention in Cincinnati formed a Hebrew 
Sabbath School Union with a constitution covering the following 
article (VII): 
Suction 1. The executive committee shall prepare plans to carry into effect the 
unification of the work of the Hebrew Sabbath schools as specified in the following 
sections: 
(a) Instruction in the principles, doctrines, and precepts of Judaism. 
(b) Instruction in reading of the Bible in the vernacular. 
(ec) Instruction in the Hebrew language at least to the extent of understanding 
the Hebrew prayers and appropriate portions of the Bible. 
(d) Instruction in Jewish history covering the biblical and post-biblical periods. 
(e) Instruction in music, with a view to prepare children to participate in the 
service. 
Src. 2. In addition to the foregoing, which shall constitute a six years’ course, 
including a one year’s course for confirmation, the executive committeo shall also 
provide for a two years’ course of instruction for a post-confirmation class anda 
complete course of study for normal classes, so as to educate advanced pupils to 
become teachers, and likewise to enable persons remote from congregations to pre- 
pare themselves to organize and conduct religious classes with the aid of the les- 
sons supplied by this course. 
Src. 8. The executive committee shall provide at intervals for the aaa 
of pamphlets containing graded lessons to be taught in said schools, such lessons 
to include brief texts with explanatory notes. They shall also provide for the 
publication of the various books of the Bible, with commentaries, also for a juve- 
nile Jewish literature of books, compiled from the rabbinical writings, or in which 
works of later Jewish authors are utilized.

Suc. 4. The executive committee shall furnish free to each Sabbath school copies 
of its publications, and each pupil in every Sabbath school shall receive free one 
copy of each pamphlet published bv the union. 
There is some overlapping in a list of subjects taught in the Hebrew 
Sabbath schools, but it seems unavoidable, as the Bible of one school 
may or may not be parallel with the Proverbs, the Psalms, or the 
Pentateuch of another, and the history of one may or may not include 
the biblical history of another. 
The American Bible Society publishes an edition of the Old Testa- 
ment without chapter headings, which isin use by many Jews. They 
object to the headings in ordinary copies of King James’s version as 
without due authority and sometimes erroneous. The King James 
translation is not fully satisfactory to them; hence the preparation of 
the Leeser Bible, already mentioned. 
The best accessible notice of a current Hebrew Sunday schogle is 
that of Mr. A. Caswell Ellis,? who visited a Hebrew reformed school 
at the Temple Emanuel on Fifth avenue, New York. He does not 
give its size. He says: 
This school meets every Sunday morning, but follows completely the principles 
and methods of the public schools. Children must get permission from the edu- 
cational committee of the church in order to enter the school. They all meet 
together in a large hall for the opening exercises of devotion, and then the school

divides into five grades, each grade going into an entirely separate room. There 
are only these five regular classes in the school, each studying one of the five 
grades of Katzenberg’s Biblical history. There is also opportunity to study post- 
biblical history, by Hecht.! In these large classes the teacher is seated at his desk 
on a platform at one end of the room, and conducts the recitation just as do the 
teachers in the graded schools. The pupils are marked, and are promoted from 
one section to another as they would be in public schools. SUNDAY SCHOOLS.

ROMAN CATHOLIC SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
In its plans for the education of youth the Roman Catholic Church 
keeps its Sunday-school work under ecclesiastical supervision and 
direction. The celebration of the mass is in many instances the pre- 
paratory service for the Sunday school, and often includes the expo- 
sition of the Scriptural lesson of the day. The church has a number 
of brotherhoods and sisterhoods devoted to teaching, for which the 
members are carefully trained, and there are summer professional 
schools which even experienced teachers attend annually. In the 
best schools the organization has a high degree of regularity and defi- 
nitene Some priest, chosen for his fitness, has the responsible 
supervision. Instructors are utilized as far as practicable from the 
teaching orders, and enough are assigned to give, in general, one 
teacher to every seven or eight pupils. The gradation in the schools    
     
-P-A-G-E-494
  414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
is more or less formal, according to circumstances, ranging from the 
youngest class in a catechism of elementary faith and duty to adults 
with text-books in Bible or church history. There is a great variety 
of eatechisms, and there are several authors whose works are used in 
the study of Bible and church history, prepared or approved by 
bishops or higher authority in the dioceses interested.t 
The following course of religious instruction for the children in a 
prominent church? is illustrative: 
Text-books.—The Baltimore Council Catechisms, Nos. 1, 2; Deharbe’s Cate- 
chisms, complete, No. 2; Gilmour’s Bible History, Murphy’s Bible and Church 
History, Noethen’s Church History, The Bible. 
Hours of instruction.—A daily recitation of lesson in school; instructions on the 
gospels at the 9 o’clock mass, Sunday morning; Sunday school for one hour imme- 
diately following 9 o’clock mass; special instruction, 9 to 10 a. m., Saturday morn- 
ing, for children who do not attend Catholic schools. 
For three months of the year instructions are given to first communicants. 
The children in the church schools receive a ‘‘ lecture” once a week in Christian 
doctrine. 
The Catholic yearbooks do not give the statistics of Sunday schools, 
though they show nearly 800,000 pupils under daily religious instrue- 
tion in 3,361 parishes at parochial schools. There is no estimate of 
the number in the Catholic Sunday schools that has more than a sug- 
gestive value. A general idea of their strength in any State may be 
based upon the return of communicants at the last census under the 
uncertain presumption that the number in Sunday school equals one- 
fourth the number of communicants. This number, as returned in 
the census of 1890, is given below as a guide to any one for a relative 
distribution of Sunday-school membership by States.

  LATTER DAY SAINTS SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has its principal 
membership in the States of Utah and Idaho. The history of the 
ehurch needs as much notice here as will enable any one to form an 
intelligent opinion regarding its Sunday schools. 
The Latter-Day Saints accept the Scriptures of the Old and New 
Testaments, and, in general, the precepts of conduct and the ordi- 
nances therein prescribed. They baptize by immersion. 
The distinction between Latter-Day Saints and most others who 
accept the Christian Scriptures begins with their claims of recent and 
continued revelations largely embodied in the Book of Mormon, from 
which has grown the common name of Mormons, distasteful to them. 
The book was put forth in 1830. There are later revelations claimed, 
including a ‘‘revelation on the eternity of the marriage covenant, 
including plurality of wives, given through Joseph the Seer in Nauvoo, 
Hancock County, Ill., July 12, 1843.” The contest over polygamy 
between the Latter-Day Saints and the nation is to many the prin- 
cipal distinctive feature of their position, yet a branch of the church, 
embracing about one-eighth of the total strength, has steadily rejected 
polygamy. 
The peculiar history of this church and its possible future in this 
eountry justify extended citations from its Sunday-school literature. 
The statistics of the Sunday schools here presented are from those 
published by the Deseret Sunday School Union for the year ending 
December 31, 1895. That union published in tabular form (1) the 
number of schools in each stake, (2) the name of the stake, (3) Stake 
superintendents with post-office addresses, (4) number of times the 
school was held during the year, (5) number of male teachers and offi- 
cers, (6) number of female teachers and officers, (7) total of (5) and (6), 
(8) average attendance of officers and teachers, (9) number of male 
pupils, (10) number of female pupils, (11) average number of pupils, 
(12) total number of officers, teachers, and pupils, (13) number of 
pupils in the primary department, (14) number of pupils in first

  intermediate department, (15) number of pupils in second interme- 
diate department, (16) number of pupils in higher department, (17) 
number of books in libraries, (18) cash on hand at last report, (19) 
miscellaneous cash collected, (20) total collection from nickel dona- 
tion, (21) grand total collected, (22) cash disbursed, (23) cash in 
treasury. 
There are nearly 40 per cent more male teachers and officers than 
female; about 3 per cent more female pupils than male. 
The Deseret Sunday School Union represents a thorough organiza- 
tion, with publications to aid the various subdivisions of the work. 
There is a general superintendency of all of the schools. There is a 
stake superintendent for each stake of Zion. The term stake is 
applied somewhat like diocese in some other churches, including all 
who form a unit for ecclesiastical purposes. 
In each stake of Zion the high priests constitute a quorum without respect to 
number; * *® a quorum of elders numbers 96, a quorum of priests 48, a quo- 
rum of teachers 24, and a quorum of deacons 12, Each of these quorums has its 
president and two counsellors.! 
  There were 35 stakes in the United States besides the missions—to 
the Eastern States, 2 schools, headquarters Brooklyn, N. Y.; to the 
Northern States, 6 schools, headquarters Kansas City, Mo.; to the 
Southern States, 27 schools, headquarters Chattanooga, Tenn. 
The books used by the Latter-Day Saints for instruction range from 
the Bible down to books of personal experiences. 
There are primers and other books for the younger children, ‘“‘A 
guide for the officers and teachers of Sunday schools in the various 
stakes of Zion,” lectures upon Sunday-school work, normal Sunday- 
school training classes in the academy at Provo, and an annual Sun- 
day-school conference of two days’ duration in each stake of Zion. 
The first Sunday of September is designated as ‘‘nickel day,” on 
which it is the aim to have each Sunday school contribute a nickel for 
every pupil enrolled. Twenty per cent of the money thus raised is 
retained for local expenses and the remainder is-turned over to the 
general fund. 
In 1894 quite definite suggestions were printed on the ‘‘ Manner of 
conducting and grading of Sunday schools,” from which the following 
paragraphs are condensed: 
Order of conducting school.—Officers and teachers should be present at 9.45 
a.m., welcome students or visitors as they enter with a kind word, assign each 
pupil to the proper place. 
Begin promptly at 10 a. m., call roll of officers and teachers, a song to be sung 
by entire school, appropriate prayer offered, then a second song, read minutes of 
previous Sabbath showing number of teachers and of pupils, by sex, and the sub- 
ject taught in each class. Then should follow the administration of that sacred 
ordinance, the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, during which the most profound

Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. By Elder John Jaques, Salt Lake City, 1897.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS. : ALT 
  silence should be maintained. If preferred, a few remarks may be made to the 
children as to the nature of the ordinance, and why they partake of it; appropri- 
ate hymns may be sung by the children or music rendered by the organist in a soft 
and reverential style. 
Then students march to appropriate music of the organ to their places of study. 
The studies should be in accordance with wishes of the Union Board. About 
11.30 * * * the school should reassemble, practice singing for ten minutes, 
and all partake of the spirit inspired by the closing exercises. When on the out- 
side of the building the children should regard the ground as sacred, and not give 
way to boisterous and irreverent conduct, but should leave the grounds in an 
orderly manner. 
Grading.—The process of assigning each pupil to the department best suited to 
his capacity and arranging the department so as to enable the pupils to progress 
by logical succession of studies is important and laborious, requiring excellent 
judgment and consideration on the part of officers and teachers. Age and yet 
more aptness and natural ability of the pupil are to be considered. While local 
conditions must modify the arrangements, speaking in a general way, each school 
should be graded into four departments where there are a sufficient number of 
pupils and proper facilities. * * * Aseparate room for each department is very 
desirable; but where there is but one room, it is found the best results follow the 
schools which have taken wires upon which are hung curtains and stretch them 
across the building, making three or four divisions—one for each grade; but it is 
well, where possible, to have the primary by itself. * * * Many schools are 
now operated with excellent results with but one room, divided as above suggested. 
The primary grade should include the smaller children under, say, 8 years of 
age; first intermediate, from 8 to 12 years of age; second intermediate, from 12 to 
16 years of age; and the higher department from 16 years of age and upward. 
These departments should not be subdivided into smaller classes, but kept as one 
and instructed as a whole by capable teachers (except where the classes are entirely 
toolarge). * * * 
Teachers.—Over each of the four departments there should be a head teacher, 
with two or three good, faithful assistants, all laboring under the direct super- 
vision of the superintendency, who, together with the teachers, should lay out a 
general plan for the whole school for six or nine months or a year. 
One of the assistant teachers is expected to make the record of 
attendance without interruption of exercises conducted by some other 
person. 
The suggestions as to the primary and first intermediate depart- 
ments are in harmony with those general titles. The caution is given 
for the first intermediate that ‘‘little reading should be allowed in the 
class. Students should be encouraged to read and study their lessons 
at home.” 
The comments tor the second intermediate touch an experience 
common to all Sunday-school work and familiar in the day schools. 
Here the children are of such an age that they require careful attention. It is 
generally the children between these ages (12 to 16) that are har@ to get into the 
Sabbath school. * * * 
Over this critical period of mental growth the teachers should aim to lead the 
pupils by instructing them and inciting a love for truth and creating ennobling 
and high aspirations; by inducing them to read at home the lives of great and 
good men and women, and in the class room to recite or put in the form of an 
essay and read the results of their home reading; by appointing certain ones to 
ED 97. 27  
-P-A-G-E-498
418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  give brief lectures on interesting and useful subjects; by requesting certain others 
to look up certain questions; by gem thoughts and any other legitimate exercise, 
all connected with the lesson, should the teacher labor to create a love and desire 
for the right and for Sunday-school work. * * * 
If the pupils of this age can be encouraged to love and attend Sabbath school 
until this critical period is passed, great good will have been accomplished, the 
Sabbath-school work will be enhanced, and the pupils placed on a solid founda- 
tion from which they will not be likely to fall. 
The higher department is to include all over 16 years of age. 
The teachers for this department should be men and women well matured in 
judgment and devoted to a conscientious performance of their work. The stu- 
dents here are supposed to have an understanding of the first principles of the gos- 
pel, and should be able to give consistent reasons for their position, quoting refer- 
ences, authority, etc. 
Special lines of the principles of theology should now be taken up and followed 
to their legitimate ends before others are handled. * * * All lessons and ref- 
erences should be prepared at home. Reciting should be the exercise, rather than 
reading round and round, as in the past. Lectures on the subject of the course 
should be given by different students, and the teacher should do little talking. 
Questions and answers should be allowed and freedom in discussing the principles 
of the gospel should be encouraged. * * * Should teachers for other depart- 
ments be needed, this is the place to select them. 
We believe if these instructions are followed out by every Sabbath school that a 
better class of work will be done. The condition of the schools will be materially 
advanced, and the moral and religious growth of the children will become a por- 
tion of their very beings. 
The following extractst have a suggestive interest throughout the 
country: 
Highest department.—Composed of teachers and also those who have passed a 
successful examination in the other departments. 
Studies.—The course of study in the department should be full and comprehen- 
sive and should be classified and arranged methodically, each study following 
another in proper order and sequence, after the following suggestive plan: 
First. The Messianic Dispensation of the Gospel, including the three years’ min- 
istry and work of the Saviour. 
Second. The history of the church the first century after the death of our 
Saviour. 
Third. The Apostacy and the Dark Ages which followed. 
Fourth. The Reformation, with a brief but clear outline of the work done by 
Wycliffe, Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Calvin, Knox, Cranmer, and others, and 
its effect upon the world. 
Fifth. The Restoration of the Gospel in its fullness by an angel to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith; the prediction of Prophets concerning the latter-day work and the 
great work of restoration and redemption to be wrought therein. * * * 
As infidelity is now growing and spreading to such an alarming extent through- 
out the Christian world, and as the ability of the majority of believers to give a 
reasonable answer, aside from Scriptural evidences, of the faith within them is so 
exceptional, it is specially desirable that one of the leading studies of the theolog- 
ical department should be a frequent and ample consideration of the evidences of 
‘Guide for officers and teachers of Sunday schools in the various stakes of Zion,

Deity, of Christianity, of the divinity of the Bible, Book of Mormon, etc., from 
such sources outside of the Scriptures as will arrest the attention of the indiffer- 
ent and skeptical, and which will enable the students to satisfactorily answer the 
sophistries of the infidel and the cavil of the mocker. Nelson’s Cause and Cure of 
Infidelity and Paley’s Evidences of Christianity and Natural Theology are excel- 
lent works treating upon these subjects.

of Mormon; Catechism Cards on Manners; the Word of Wisdom and

UNITARIAN SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
In the (Congregational) Unitarian churches, in addition to classes 
organized after a customary plan for study of the Bible, certain spe- 
cial classes may be found, as, for example, the following for persons 
above 16 years of age in a church of Boston, Mass.: First, the ‘‘ Citi- 
zenship class” of gentlemen and ladies who wish to study the methods 
and principles of our Government; second, ‘‘How our part of the 
world was made,” involving the elements of the geology of the 
neighborhood.! 
The report of the Unitarian Sunday School Society for 1896 gives

a list of 189 contributing churches and Sunday schools distributed by

organizations of the denomination. The numbers enrolled are not 
given. 
CONSOLIDATION OF ALL REPORTS OF ATTENDANCE OBTAINED FOR 
SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
The complete statistics of Sunday schools do not appear ever to 
have been satisfactorily gathered. The attempts to gather them in 
the census produced no results accessible to the public, although a 
great amount of labor was expended, especially in the Tenth Census. 
The lack of accurate records in many cases and the vast amount of 
volunteer service of a casual sort is a hindrance to the precision of 
returns. 
The Protestant ecclesiastical bodies generally include Sunday 
school returns in their yearbooks; but, as there will be occasion to 
observe, their methods of tabulation vary so that a summary for the 
country is not readily made from the separate reports.’ 
The following statement represents in a general way the total num- 
ber of scholars derived from all reports accessible: 
Scholars reported in Sunday schools, 1895. 
In schools reported by the International Sunday School Convention_.. 10,893, 523 
In Hebrew Sunday schools 13, 506 
In Latter-Day Saints Sunday schools. .. 81, 903 
In Roman Catholic Sunday schools (estimated) -- 1,500,000 
This indicates something like 12,500,000 scholars in Sunday schools 
of all qualities and degrees of excellence. 
  SUNDAY SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
The publishing houses of the great denominations have catalogues 
of books intended for Sunday school libraries, especially within their 
own constituency. As an aid to those who have limited means for 
purchase and care and limited experience in selection, it is common 
for publishers of books intended for Sunday schools to prepare sets 
that may be purchased complete in uniform sizes and bindings, often 
included in boxes to serve as bookcases in the schools. These vary 
from $5 upward in cash and from 25 volumes upward in books. The 
library sometimes assumes a great importance in connection with the

SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 421 
  Sunday school, becoming a circulating library of sufficient consequence 
to be kept accessible on one or more days between Sundays. Some 
schools maintain reference libraries containing the standard church 
histories, Bible dictionaries, and commentaries. Where a school has 
funds at command, a suitable place for housing the library, and a 
membership of readers, the library may grow to require the fullest 
professional care in selection and administration. 
The condition of Sunday school libraries has provoked considerable 
comment within recent months. Without entering upon the adverse 
and defensive statements put forth, the following paragraph is quoted 
for a view of the situation as it appears to officers of the oldest society 
in this country, prominent in the supply of such libraries: 
The diversity of opinion respecting books suitable to be placed in Sunday school 
libraries has become more marked during the past year. This diversity tends 
toward two extremes—one admitting all sorts of literary works popularly desig- 
nated as “standard and current literature,” the other admitting only that which 
is intended to explain and enforce Biblical passages, and which is studied in the 
Sunday school classes. Hence there is a marked increase in the tendency of Sun- 
day schools to fill their libraries with the common, cheap works of history, science, 
philosophy, and fiction, which make no pretense of containing the truths of the 
gospel, and not unfrequently make covert attacks upon religion, or have an under- 
tone of antagonism to the gospel as old fashioned and quite out of date. This 
disposition to ‘‘ bait the worldly ” by secularizing the Sunday school library has 
caused some schools to throw out the library altogether, lest its influence should 
become satanic rather than saving. In both these ways the circulation of works 
of a decidediy religious type through the Sunday school has been diminished. 
In some schools there is a regular system of maintenance, occasion- 
ally by endowment, and books that have possessed local usefulness 
are placed where some one may yet find valuein them. The plan of the 
New York Yearly Meeting of Friends (Hicksite) for furnishing “‘tray- 
eling libraries” of selected books to be exchanged among country 
schools, already mentioned under Friends, has a suggestion of well- 
guarded selection, large privilege, and wide usefulness at a moderate 
cost. Lack of means, want of facilities for care, and other contin- 
gencies limit the possibilities of libraries in greater or less degree. 
Some schools make large use of children’s papers to supplement 
libraries in the circulation of reading matter, and in some cases the 
papers alone are used. While varying considerably in excellence, 
these papers often have pictorial illustrations that are prized by 
children, especially by those who have scanty literary help from other 
sources. Few denominations have records showing the number of 
Sunday-school libraries or the number of books therein. The Hicks- 
ite Friends report 107 libraries, with 30,937 volumes; the Presbyterian 
Church in the United States of America, 939,587 volumes; the Latter 
Day Saints, 50,067 volumes in Sunday-school libraries.

SUMMARY. 
The conditions of Hebrew Sunday schools have a special interest as 
among those whose ancient faith is a substructure upon which the 
belief of all who accept the Christian Scriptures rests. The Roman 
Catholic schools have a direct interest as traceable to the opening of 
the Christian era. A like interest attaches to the plans for religious 
education by Comenius, the great teacher of the Moravian Brethren, 
who claim to be a part of the original church. The schools of the 
Lutherans have an interest as representing in some degree the spirit 
 
-P-A-G-E-503
  SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 423 
of those who left the Roman Catholic Church as reformers and who 
have become the Protestant denominations of our day. The Friends, 
in certain yearly meetings, show noteworthy attention to home train- 
ing. The work of the International Sunday School Convention repre- 
sents a large part of the effort of great denominations. The schools 
of the Latter Day Saints form part of the history of a remarkable 
religious movement wholly within the memory of living men as illus- 
trating methods of propagating belief. Widely different as these 
groups and others in our country are in many respects, all have some 
community of belief and of purpose. Even if one or another is deemed 
to hold to error, any success it seems to gain is suggestive to the per- 
son who would teach a different faith, in so far as it leads to a careful 
examination of the relative value of the means employed in education. 
The Sabbath school as a place of religious instruction dates from 
the original observance of the Sabbath by families. 
Fundamentally, religious instruction is a parental or family duty. 
In association of families into communities this duty has been more 
or less assumed by the unit of organization, the church or the state. 
While the periodicals of the day give greatest prominence to.the 
international selection of lessons and the international organization 
is the chief agency for gathering statistics of Sunday schools, it must 
be recognized that some prominent educators do not indorse it, and 
even in the recent International Sunday School Convention criticism 
was made regarding the methods of selections and use. 
Without entering upon discussion of the comparative merits of dif- 
ferent lesson schemes, it is for historical accuracy to mention that 
there are whole denominations that do not use the international les- 
son; individual schools in other denominations and individual classes 
in numerous schools pursue courses laid out for their own special 
circumstances; other systems claim a large body of adherents for 
their advantages over the international series. The international 
committee has under consideration such modification of its plans 
that absolute uniformity of the Scripture lessons for all classes with 
gradation of limited methods of presentation will cease to be a pecu- 
liarity. A system that has gained large following has, as a promi- 
nent feature, gradation in the fundamental matter, the Scripture 
selections, as well as in the mode of presentation. Moreover, in the 
early years of international lessons little attention was paid to the 
church year whose special appointments have prominent consideration 
in certain great denominations. Latterly there has been a growing 
recognition of Christmas, Easter, and other church anniversaries in 
the international lessons to make them more widely acceptable. 
The Hebrew school described by Mr. Ellis as cited, the plans of the 
Latter Day Saints, as cited under the subtitle Teachers, have a single 
responsible teacher for a department of the school, with such assist- 
ants as may be needed for seconding directions, attending to records,
-P-A-G-E-504
424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  and other incidental details. The same plan is occasionally success- 
fully followed, especially with juvenile classes, in other schools. 
The Lutheran congregations generally have catechetical classes in 
addition to the Sunday-school instruction for some months previous 
to Easter, preparatory to confirmation. The Protestant Episcopal 
churches have a similar custom. Many churches of Presbyterian 
connection have systematic instruction in the catechism in connec- 
tion with the Sunday school or in addition to it. Other denomina- 
tions make more or less use of catechisms. The Roman Catholic 
Church has special courses preparatory to confirmation. 
Schools in austere climates, as on the Dakota prairies, must close 
often by reason of the severity of weather, and many are suspended 
for some weeks of the winter. In some of our great cities in warmer 
latitudes are schools that close even as long as three months for sum- 
mer vacation by reason of heat and the absence of members from 
their city homes. These suspensions must break the continuity of 
series of lessons worked out for each Sunday of the year. Many 
make still further interruptions to systematic instruction for sever: oe 
special occasions of the year. 
The case of the Sunday school as a pioneer or mission enterprise 
varies somewhat from that of a Sunday school as one of the services 
of a well-established congregation. It serves as a nucleus for the 
best effort for improvement to a degree unknown in churches or in 
neighborhoods equipped with all the facilities of prosperous modern 
societies. 
[Nore oN THE TABLES OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS.—One who has followed the report 
on Sunday schools carefully will have observed unsatisfactory elements in the fig- 
ures given. No matter what subject is under investigation, if the facts required 
pertain to a period prior to the time of investigation, accurate records are essen- 
tial to give an accurate showing. No visitor of a school can tell its attendance of 
a previous week or month or year except through records, and if theyare wanting 
or imperfect no satisfactory summing up can be made. It would be well if there 
were a general agreement upon the facts to be recorded, which is hardly to be 
immediately expected, and yet it seems possible for great denominations, if not for 
national organizations, to agree within themselves what facts to make matters of 
fixed record. 
Within the same denomination one subdivision will report ‘‘membership,” 
which may include officers, teachers, and pupils, as ‘‘total enrollment” in certain 
other cases appears to do, or it may include only pupils, as is customary in public 
school records. Some Sunday schools report pupils and do not report teachers. 
After all allowance for accidents befalling work ready for the press there seems 
to be in some quarters opportunity for more careful oversight of tabular work in 
manuscript and in proof. In one case the columns of a summary for scholarsand 
for teachers were interchanged througk a page, which attracted attention by the 
improbable showing, and was correctible by the detailed tables on which the sum- 
mary was based. In another case, where the showing was improbable and there 
were no details given for verification, a letter to the editor of the tables secured a 
correction and statement that the error had not been previously noticed and it 
could not be determined how it occurred. Errors of ordinary addition are very 
common. This office has made the best use possible of the material available,
-P-A-G-E-505
  SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 425 
With improvements in records there can be improvement in tables based on those 
records, so that there is hope for betterment. 
There have been eight international Sunday school conventions at intervals of 
three years. In the twenty-oneyears of the organization it is still uncertain what 
facts are covered by the international tables. The following extract is from a 
letter dated January 12, 1897, from M. D. Byers, international secretary, in reply 
to a letter of inquiry: 
“«There is some variation in the reports from the different States giving the 
statistics of Sunday schools. I believe that the First-day schools or Sabbath 
schools of the Friends and also the Universalist schools are included.” 
It is preSumed that the secretary’s belief is correct, and the schools of the 
Friends and the Universalists have been placed as included in the international 
tables, for which, however, the secretary stated in his letter of transmittal, the 
committee has no details. 
In the effort to ascertain the limitations of the international tables the following 
statement was received: 
“Thave had some trouble in former years to exclude nonevangelical Sunday 
schools from the statistics, but I think that the St. Louis report may safely be 
regarded as strictly evangelical.” Letter of E. Payson Porter, late secretary 
International Sunday School Association. The convention at St. Louis was held 
in 1893; hence the reference to the St. Louis report. 
. The imperfection of local record is evident to anyone who has attempted to 
investigate the subject.—J. H. B.]

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS, COURSES OF STUDY, AND 
DEGREES, MADE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES 
AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS, NOVEMBER 10, 1896. 
  Fy 
oR 
Your committee, appointed November, 1894, and continued with further instruc- 
tions at the last annual meeting of this association, presents the following report: 
ARTICLE I. 
Srcrion 1. Congress, in establishing and endowing the institutions known as 
the land-grant colleges, evidently intended that their work for the classes they 
were designed to benefit should be, as far as practicable, uniform in scope and 
character in the different States and Territories. It is inevitable, however, that 
this uniformity, desirable as it is, should be somewhat limited or conditioned by 
the environment of each college. 
Sxc. 2. The act of 1890, further endowing these colleges, points to their deyelop- 
ment along certain specified lines. In conformity with the spirit of this act, these 
institutions are constantly tending to become schools or institutes of technology. 
That they must be collegiate in scope is required by the law itself. 
Src. 2, The steadily increasing tendency to ignore and obliterate all State lines 
in scientific and educational work; the free intercourse in social and industrial 
life among the people of the several States, and, in consequence, the steadily 
broadening field of usefulness and activity open to the graduates of educational 
institutions; the association of the land-grant colleges into a national organiza- 
tion for the protection and promotion of their common interests; the increasing 
recognition by the National Government of the importance and promise of the 
work of these colleges—all these considerations make it desirable that the degree 
or degrees awarded by these colleges should represent work approximately uni- 
form in character and scope; should be, in other words, degrees of such recog- 
nized value as to pass current, each the equivalent of the others, in any State or 
Territory. 
Szc. 4. It is clearly recognized that the social and educational conditions pre- 
vailing in the several States make it impossible, for the present, to prescribe

tion regarding colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. ie 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
  A428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  uniform requirements for admission into the colleges of this class. In some 
States, for some time to come, concession must be made to the defective condi- 
tion of the public school system. But it by no means follows that in making such 
concessions the colleges are prohibited from protecting their standards of work 
and graduation. These, by proper effort, may be maintained and made to con- 
form in educational value to those of the colleges which are more happily situated. 
Moreover, a certain community of interest makes it the duty of each college to 
protect at the same time its own reputation for thorough educational work and 
the reputation of its sister institutions. 
Sec. 5. The educational conditions prevailing in the United States make it 
impossible to require of students in schools of applied science or technology that 
their liberal training should be acquired in preparatory schools. These institu- 
tions, therefore, can not exclusively confine their attention to technical subjects. 
They must include in their courses for graduation certain elements of a liberal 
(or general) education. 
Suc, 6. These considerations, thus briefly outlined, make it desirable that all 
colleges in membership with this association should unite in requiring for the 
bachelor’s degree or degrees at least the following general studies: 
Mathematics, at least through algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. 
Physics and chemistry, with laboratory work in each. 
English language and literature, at least two years’ work. 
Other languages (one, at least, modern), four years. 
Mental science, and logic or moral science, one year. 
Constitutional law. 
Social, political, or economic science, one year. 
Suc. 7. 1t is desirable, also, that the bachelor’s degree or degrees should repre- 
sent an approximate uniformity in the amount of work done in the several col- 
leges. The conditions generally affecting these colleges are such that a greater 
amount of work is demanded of their students than is required in the colleges of 
longer standing and other traditions. In the judgment of your committee it is 
not too much to require the equivalent of fifteen hours per week of recitations 
and lectures, together with ten hours per week of laboratory work or practicums, 
including the time devoted to military science and drill. Upon this basis, the 
above-mentioned general studies should be assigned a relative importance approx- 
imately as follows: 
          
       Hours. 
Algebra -. 75 | Ethics or logic... 
Geometry 40 | Political econom: 
Trigonom: 40 | General histor, 
Physics -- - #150 | Constitutional law 
Chemistry - 150 
English 200 Total excluding laboratory work... 1 Modern lan: 340 — 
Psychology 60 Total... ~ 1,285 
The total number of hours included in a four-years course, allowing 15 hours 
per week for 36 weeks, would be 2,160; with 10 hours laboratory work or practi- 
cums added, 3,600. In general terms, therefore, the foregoing general studies 
should comprise about two-fifths of the work required for a bachelor’s degree. 
Src. 8. It is recommended that in the establishment and nomenclature of degrees 
the colleges should strictly observe the doctrine of parsimony, and that only the 
baccalaureate degree of bachelor of science be conferred for a technical course of 
four years. 
Statement in the diploma that the degree is conferred for the accomplishment 
of the course in agriculture, engineering, chemistry, etc., would afford differen- 
tiation enough to distinguish the several varieties of the degree. 
aIncluding 75 hours laboratory work.

ARTICLE IL, 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
Srcotion 1. The difference in the character of the school systems, both public 
and private, of the several States is too great, in the opinion of the committee, to 
permit the formulation of rigid entrance requirements applicable to all the col- 
leges having membership in this association. 
Src. 2. But the committee holds that it is advisable, as a beginning, to deter- 
mine the requirements in a few subjects upon which it is possible for all the col- 
leges to agree, and to recommend others, which, although too high at present for 
adoption by some of these institutions, may yet serve as a standard or goal toward. 
which effort may be directed. 
Sec. 3. As a standard series of entrance requirements, to be adopted as soon as 
possible, we recommend the following: 
. Physical geography. 
. United States history. 
. Arithmetic, including the metric system. 
. Algebra, to quadratics. 
. English grammar and composition, together with the English requirements 
of the New England Association. 
6. Plane geometry. 
7. One foreign langauge. 
8. One of the natural sciences. 
9. Ancient, general, or English history. 
Sec. 4. From a careful examination of the catalogues we believe it to be practi- 
cable, either now or in the near future, for these institutions to unite in requiring 
as a minimum for admission to their lowest collegiate class: 
. Physical geography. 
. United States history. 
Arithmetic, including the metric system. 
. Algebra, to quadratics. 
. English grammar and composition, together with the Engnsh requirements 
of the New England Association. oe ow we ewe ~ on 
ARTICLE ITI. 
We recommend that the conclusions embodied in this report be adopted as indi- 
cating essentially the position of this association; with the express declaration, 
however, that the association in adopting this report does not attempt to exercise 
any function other than an advisory one, and that any attempt to enforce an arbi- 
trary uniformity would result in unmixed evil. These conclusions may be summed. 
up as follows: 
1. That two series of entrance requirements, a standard series and a minimum 
series, be approved by the association, and that the two series herein given be so 
approved. 
2. That approximately 15 hours be devoted to recitations or lectures each week 
for 36 weeks each year; that 10 hours laboratory work or practicums be added. 
3. That the list of studies given in section 7 of this report be included in every 
course leading to a bachelor’s degree. 
4, That the degree of bachelor of science be recognized as the standard degree 
conferred by the colleges of this association.

REPORT OF THE SECTION ON COLLEGE WORK T0 THE TENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 
OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERI 
MENT STATIONS. 
  By J. E. Srupps, Chairman. 
Mr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVENTION: Owing to the quite 
recent resignation of the chairman of the ‘‘ Section on college work,” I have been 
called, as vice-chairman, to perform his duties. Whatever of completeness and 
thoroughness may be lacking to this paper is due to the very limited time allotted 
to its preparation. 
LT invite your attention at first toa somewhat common incident. Imagine your- 
selves for the moment in the ‘‘library car” of the Union Pacific Express, east 
pound, on the evening of the 4th of November. For the most part, the occupants 
of the car are Western men of affairs, keen and practical. Conversation and dis- 
cussion over the exciting news of election day have begun to grow weary, when 
suddenly new interest is aroused by the introduction of a fresh topic, namely, the 
kind of an education which should be given tofarmers’ sons. Two bright-minded 
men, one from Montana and the other from Colorado, affirm that there is too 
much of higher-education nonsense in the country; that one of the modern here- 
sies is that of giving the so-called higher education to farmers and farmers’ sons, 
who would do better for themselves and their country if they were content with 
a common-school education along with the practical discipline and training of 
the farm. This opinion is hailed by a chorus of approval, with the further obser- 
yation that there is too much of football and of similar sports in the college edu- 
cation of to-day. The first protest against the views just set forth came froma 
young lawyer, I guess, of Wyoming, who charmed us by a prophetic vision of the 
possible Websters and Clays and Jacksons that might be lost to our country if 
the farmer boy should fail to realize his ambitious dreams of public life because 
of the repressive influences which restrict his education to the district school and 
his scientific training to the field and the stable. 
This incident is worth noting for the reason that it expresses the views and con- 
victions of very many men who are thoroughly practical, able, and successful in 
their own respective callings. 
Being an interested listener to the discussion, I tried to formulate in my mind 
three propositions which, by way of answer, I should be willing to maintain: 
First. That the higher education, so called, has become absolutely essential to 
the prosperity and welfare of those who choose agriculture as a business or a life 
calling. This holds true also with respect to industrial callings, such as engineer- 
ing in its various branches and the higher class of commercial activities, If it be 
true that ‘‘the test of national welfare is the intelligence and prosperity of the 
farmer,” then the colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts established by the Fed- 
eral Government have been wisely established, and will cement more firmly the 
foundation of the national prosperity and honor. Our practical mining friends of 
the discussion have simply failed, like many others, to give the due weight to the 
remarkable changes which have taken place in the industrial training and educa- 
tion of youth. The technical schools and the schools of applied science in colleges 
and universities have taken the place of the shop and the foundry of our fathers’ 
time, and partly, too, of the farm, in the industrial education of this country and 
of other countries as well. These institutions for higher education, these colleges 
of agriculture and mechanic arts, now stand at the end of the Appian Way, to 
eager feet the noblest gateway to the Eternal City of industrial and commercial 
prosperity, as well as to political peace and supremacy. 
On the other hand, the lawyer from Wyoming has failed to grasp the truth that 
there are other lines of education than the accepted type of classical education 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
  CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 431 
which, while giving wide range of choice to special taste and aptitude, is both 
broad and liberalizing, and gives development and culture to the man, while 
training him in the particular disciplines which fit him for the successful pursuit 
of industrial and commercial callings. 
If, according to Dr. W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Education, 
“urban life is the life of the future and of the highest civilization,” one or the 
other of tsvo effects must follow in the future life and growth of this country. 
Hither our soil will-be tilled by tenants for the benefit of the landowner who resides 
in town or city, giving thereby encouragement to the growth of two distinct 
classes—the one a poor, dependent peasantry, the other an intelligent but selfish 
and unpatriotic class of absentee landlords—or we must cherish and develop in 
our schools and colleges that kind of training and culture which shall build up 
an intelligent, prosperous, and independent class of farmers and artisans, each 
of whom owns his own home, tills his own fields, markets his own products, 
helps to regulate the affairs of his own township, sits in the councils of his own 
State or of the nation, in character, in intellectual, and in social qualities the 
peer of lawyer, capitalist, or priest. 
Second. That the interest in athletic field sports, such as football, baseball, and 
tennis, in our colleges, though but incidental to the life and work of these institu- 
tions, has nevertheless an ethical, and thereby educational, value which is worthy 
of high regard. 
The college president who keeps in view the highest character development of 
his students knows full well that the athletic exercises which have become, and 
which will remain, a striking feature of college life do, when properly guided and 
guarded, displace to a considerable degree the pernicious practices that spring 
into action when any body of young people are brought together in common asso- 
ciation, and do further promote the cultivation and attainment of the better quali- 
ties of personal character—such, for example, as courage, obedience, endurance, 
and regard for personal honor. The gymnasium of Germany and the public school 
of England offer a strong contrast in this matter of school and college field sports, 
but the free and vigorous activity of Eton’s football or cricket field is superior 
from every point of view to the rigid and systematic ordering of the daily exercise 
of the German gymnasium boy and to the dueling practice and drinking habits of 
the university student. The truth is that the outdoor life and the field sports, 
which have grown so rapidly into favor with American colleges, not only with the 
colleges for young men but also with those for young women, may be so guided 
as to promote a higher average of scholarship, good habits, perfect health, yea, a 
graceful type of womanhood as well as a sturdy type of manhood. 
Third. That in the correlation of the subjects of instruction and discipline 
according to accepted pedagogic principles.in the courses of study offered by the 
colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts, it will be found that the particular 
subjects in mathematics and in pure and applied science are carefully harmonized 
with those general subjects in language and literature, in the social sciences, 
and in history and philosophy, which pertain to the college courses usually 
denominated liberal. 
As bearing upon this point, I quote the views of Prof. E. W. Hilgard, of the 
University of California, as given to me very recently in a personal letter. He 
speaks of the course in agriculture given by the University of California as fol- 
lows: ‘‘ With the average preparation we can command in this State, we find it 
necessary to devote the first two years of four substantially to the preparatory 
sciences and general culture studies, while the last two are given to the technical 
studies chiefly, though not exclusively. Among these elections should always be 
allowed, enabling the student to put special weight upon those branches that will 
be of chief importance to him in after life. We do not as yet in this country aim 
to educate all-around agricultural experts. There is too little demand for them;
-P-A-G-E-512
432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
and when the demand arises, the degree and kind of preparation is likely to have 
been changed by the introduction of agricultural science into the preparatory 
school. Then only will it be possible to establish a uniform course for the degree 
of bachelor of agriculture that will hold good all around. It makes a wide differ- 
ence, too, whether the student comes from the farm or from the city. The latter 
clearly requires a different course, especially as regards practical studies, from 
the boy who has grown up on the farm and merely needs to give the explanation, 
as it were, of the practices he is already familiar with, An all-round agricultural 
expert can not, with our usual preparation, be turned out in four years. Agri- 
cultural science is the most complex of all, embracing as it does all the sciences 
from mathematics through physics, chemistry, both inorganic and organic, min- 
eralogy and geology, botany, zoology, both theoretical and technical, vegetable 
and animal physiology, plus a certain amount of engineering. Unless a man 
specializes, the field is two wide to be covered in four years with any degree of 
thoroughness. For the present, then, we must leave the way open to specialization 
after a certain amount of general training, the time for which varies constantly 
with the conditions of the public and the preparatory schools.” 
Again, touching further upon the preparation and character of technical work 
in the course of agriculture leading to the degree of bachelor of science, Prof. 
Thomas F. Hunt, dean of the College of Agriculture of the Ohio State University, 
writes to me as follows: 
‘In a general way, I would say that the four-years’ course in agriculture lead- 
ing to the degree of bachelor of science should consist of one-third technical work 
of applied science, one-third science, and one-third language, history, and philo- 
sophical studies. It is of course difficult to classify studies precisely into the three 
groups mentioned, but in a general way I think we all understand it. On this 
basis our course at the Ohio State University, requiring 206 hours for graduation, 
contains the following technical work: 
        PROTICHIEOs = oe Hokie Sao ones ee ae a eee 36 
Agricultural chemistry --- - 20 
Horticulture 
Veterinary medicine. 
conomic-entomology= -o: =>... oceee ones Sse 5 
a total of 84 hours. Of the 206 hours, it is to be noticed further that 30 hours are 
~ elective, and that these may or may not betechnical. But, disregarding the num- 
ber of elective hours, we require 84 hours which may be fairly termed technical. 
This gives rather more than one-third technical work, and perhaps this is a little 
heavy.” 
It is to be observed that the 206 hours at the Ohio State University represents a 
fraction more than 17 hours a week for 12 terms. The proportion of technical 
work in the course outlined by Professor Hunt, even if we credit the 30 hours of 
election to technical subjects, and thus establish a course which represents the 
maximum number of hours to technical discipline, allows ample room for such 
cultural and social studies as will stamp the course with the character of giving 
a liberal education to its students. 
It may be observed further that the acquaintance with the general truths of 
science which these technical subjects give will be of great service in the rational 
interpretation of all social phenomena, and we may therefore credit the technical 
studies with a definite value in respect to the kind of knowledge ‘‘ which is of most 
worth.’ 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
One of the most important subjects at present engaging the attention of the 
association is that which pertains to the requirements in branches of study that 
shall be established for admission to the freshman class of the colleges of agricul-
-P-A-G-E-513
CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 433 
ture and mechanic arts, the extent and variety of the courses of study to be offered, 
and the academic degrees which shall bu bestowed. 
The deep and widespread interest in this subject is in evidence by the appoint- 
ment, two years since, of a committee from this association, by the report of the 
committee of ten on secondary school studies and the report of the committee of 
fifteen on elementary education, both to the National Education Association, and 
also the report on the subject of entrance requirements by the Society for the Pro- 
motion of Engineering Education. Further, the appointment of a standing com- 
mittee of five members from this association whose duty it shall be to report 
annually upon the best methods used in the various colleges and universities in 
the United States and in Europe for the instruction of students in the practical 
and scientific facts relating to agriculture, with the view to bringing instruction 
in agriculture into pedagogic form, gives additional emphasis to the importance 
of the matter of entrance requirements, and also the earnest purpose of the pro- 
moters of scientific and industrial education to put their subjects and methods 
‘into scientific form and relations. 
1 submit herewith the results of a brief study of the facts as they bear upon the 
present standard of requirement for admission to the freshman class of the col- 
leges and universities that have membership in this association. The questions 
which I submitted to the colleges, bearing upon the questions of entrance require- 
ments, were intended to be specific and easily answered. I have received no 
replies to my letters from Utah and North Carolina. 
Out of forty-six colleges reporting, thirty have preparatory departments; six- 
teen have no subfreshman classes. In these preparatory schools, ten colleges 
have a one-year course; eight have a two-years’ course; six have a three-years’ 
course; one has a four-years’ course; five are indefinite, merely reporting a sub- 
freshman class. 
SPECIFIC SUBJECTS. 
English.—Highteen colleges have the standard high-school requirements in 
English language and literature for admission to the freshman year. Twenty- 
eight colleges require that which represents the work accomplished in the eighth 
or ninth grade of the public schools. 
Arithmetic.—Thirty-eight colleges require this subject to be completed. Hight - 
colleges require the subject as far as interest and proportion. 
Algebra.—Thirty-four colleges require algebra to or through quadratic equations. 
Four require the academic algebra to be finished. Hight do not ask for algebra. 
Geometry.—Five colleges ask all of plane and solid geometry. Eleven colleges 
require all of plane geometry. Four colleges require from two to four books of 
plane geometry. Twenty-six colleges do not place geometry upon the list of sub- 
jects for admission to the freshman year. 
United States history.—All the colleges make history of the United States an 
entrance requirement. Thirteen colleges require also general history. 
Physics.—Fifteen colleges require elementary physics with laboratory practice. 
Chemistry.—Nine colleges require elementary chemistry with laboratory work. 
Physiology.—Seventeen colleges require elementary physiology. 
Botany.—Hight colleges require elementary botany with field practice. 
French or German.—Eight colleges require a reading knowledge of French or 
German. 
Latin.—Twenty colleges offer from one to three years of Latin in their prepara- 
tory schools, and several offer Greek. 
The institutions which have no preparatory departments are chiefly the univer- 
sities in the wealthy and populous States where there are first-class high schools 
-in all the cities and towns. In the newer and less populous States a well-equipped 
preparatory school of high-school grade, with courses of studies covering a period 
ED 97. 28   
 
-P-A-G-E-514
434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of three or four years, is a necessity and will continue to be a necessity for very 
many years to come. The preparatory department is the means of supply to the 
college of many students who otherwise would never think of taking a college 
course. 
It is evident, too, that the agricultural colleges divide themselves into two 
classes. 
The one class receives the student into its freshman class from the eighth or 
ninth grade of the public school. The course in agriculture then becomes in the 
main a technical high-school course of study, with special reference to the farm 
and the farmer. 
The other class of agricultural colleges requires the completion of a high-school 
course of study as a requisite for admission to its freshman class, and then seeks 
to maintain strong four-year courses in agriculture and in the applied-science 
courses, such as civil, electrical, mechanical, and mining engineering. In those 
States where the State university maintains strong schools of applied science and 
where the agricultural college is an entirely separate institution from the State 
university, itis evident that the college of agriculture and mechanic arts has found 
its field of work to be limited to giving a thoroughly practical training adapted 
to young men and young women who have finished such courses as are laid down 
in our best ungraded schools and best grammar schools. 
The weight of opinion in this association seems to be that the colleges endowed 
by the Federal Government under the acts of 1862 and 1890 should be colleges 
according to the accepted standard in the best educational circles. I quote a 
paragraph from President Alvord’s address, given at Denver last year, viz: ‘‘Insti- 
tutions in affiliation with this association should in all respects be colleges in fact 
as well as in name.” 
NUMBER OF COURSES OFFERED. 
  In reply to the question, ‘‘How many four-year courses do you maintain?” I 
note the following: Ohio State University offers 15 courses; University of Wash- 
ington, 14; Pennsylvania State College, 12; Maine State College, 9; California, 
Purdue, Kentucky State, Minnesota, Cornell, Virginia, and Wyoming, 7; Dela- 
ware, Idaho, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, 6; five colleges give 5 courses; eight col- 
leges give 4; three colleges give 8, and fourteen colleges give 1 and 2 courses with 
numerous electives. 
This general outline of the number of courses shows that the colleges of this 
association, even the weakest of them, are able to give a breadth and variety to 
their college work which is enjoyed only by the students of the oldest and best- 
known universities of this land. 
The distinguishing feature of most all these courses of study is that they belong 
to the department of applied science. This is what differentiates them most strik- 
ingly from the average college of liberal arts. This it is that characterizes these 
colleges as the great schools for the industrial life of this country. This gives to 
us the great opportunity for training young men and women of high character 
and lofty ideals to become examples as well as leaders in the world’s commer¢ial 
and industrial activities. 
All the colleges give courses in agriculture. Twenty-five have courses in civil 
engineering, twenty-two in mechanical engineering, twelve in electrical engineer- 
ing, and five in mining engineering. Many of the mining States have a school of 
mines entirely separate from any other institution or in connection with the State 
university. 
FEW STUDENTS IN AGRICULTURE, 
But why so few students in the advanced agricultural courses? I think the 
answer is found in the conditions of agriculture at the present time; other depart-
-P-A-G-E-515

ments of labor are more remunerative than that of farming. In many of the 
States there is not a ready market for agricultural products. In some States, at 
least, if not in all, the farmers themselves are not awake to the value of training 
in the agricultural college. In August last 85 boys, farmers’ boys, entered the 
University of California, but not one entered the course in agriculture. 
The 6 students who did enter the course of agriculture were from the cities. 
Yet it is wholesome to the thought and life of all our industries that agriculture 
be elevated to a worthy place in our system of college education. The compara- 
tively few students who may complete these courses are worth to the country all 
their training costs, and when the time comes for the adjustment of the present 
unequal distribution of rewards of labor, the college-trained scientific farmer will 
be in patriotic demand. 
All the colleges save eight are making special efforts to attract students to 
courses in agriculture. Addresses before farmers’ institutes, lectures upon scien- 
tific topics, newspapers, bulletins, and contributions to newspapers are the prin- 
cipal means of bringing the work of the college to the notice and the esteem of the 
public. 
MILITARY INSTRUCTION, 
  The department of military instruction in the colleges of this association is a 
subject I can not leave unnoticed. The military authorities have given particu- 
lar attention to this subject from their point of view within the past two years. 
The Adjutant-General of the Army in his report for 1896 to the Secretary of War 
says: ‘‘The average number of students at the several institutions during the 
scholastic year was 8,401 less than during the preceding one, due perhaps to pre- 
vailing monetary depression. The number of those capable of military duty was, 
however, 3,009 more, and the number required to be enrolled as military studexts 
has increased 2,761. The aptitude and interest of these students under military 
instruction is generally satisfactory.” The Adjutant-General further says: ‘The 
law authorizing details should be amended. I recommend that hereafter no detail 
be made to any institution that can not guarantee an enrollment of at least 150 
military students, and that military professors at institutions having a less num- 
ber in their military department be withdrawn and returned to their regiments.” 
If the recommendation of the Adjutant-General should become a law, the agri- 
cultural colleges of the following States would lose the detail of the military pro- 
fessor according to the report of last year under the head ‘‘ Required enrolled as 
military students,” viz: Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Washing- 
ton, Wyoming; twenty colleges in all. Now, Iventure to affirm that to strike 
these twenty States from the benefit of the military instruction provided for under 
the Morrill act would lose to the service much of the very best work that is done 
outside of West Point and the purely military schools. Take an illustration: I 
find that one of the leading Ohio colleges reports 997 students as capable of mili- 
tary duty. Of these 119 received military instruction and 77 were uniformed. It 
is evident from the above figures that the military spirit and military training 
does not abound in that institution. Furthermore, every college man knows that 
in the larger institutions of the East and middle West it is difficult to develop and 
maintain good military spirit and discipline. Now, compare this example with 
the Nevada State University that last year had at one time nearly 142 in the 
cadet battalion, that had an average attendance of 114 cadets, every one in uni- 
form; every one required to perform his military duties regularly and strictly 
under the instruction of the commandant; theoretical instruction in the art and 
science of war given as a college requirement once a week to the cadets of the 
junior and senior classes of the university; one bour to drill every college day in   
-P-A-G-E-516
436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the week, save one, throughout the year, and the military department in favor 
with students and faculty. Now, what is true of the Nevada State University is 
true, I believe, with nearly all the colleges established under the Morrill act. 
The number of cadets in the Military Academy at West Point last year was 331. 
The recommendation of the Adjutant-General would put the minimum number 
of students in one of the colleges of this association to get the detail of an army 
officer at 150, but 15 less than the half of the total number at the United States 
Military Academy last year. 
Again, in a recent article by Maj. Joseph E. Sanger, it is intimated that there 
is a decline in interest on the part of the officers of the colleges in the military 
department, that the instruction is not always up to the standard, and that in 
some faculties there is to be found positive opposition to the military department. 
I must say that I do not think these criticisms apply justly to many of the col- 
leges. They ought not to apply to any. The provision for military instructions 
in the Morrill Act is a good provision, and should be welcomed by the administra- 
tion of every college that enjoys the benefit of that act. ‘Whatever is worth 
doing at all is worth doing well” applies right here. It will be very easy, more- 
over, to remove any occasion for the above criticism. 
To avoid any possible misunderstanding that the college faculty is not favor- 
able to the department of military work, it should be understood that the mili- 
tary department is responsible, through its commandant, directly to the president 
of the college or university, and through him to the board of regents and trustees. 
Again, the instruction in military science and tactics should be placed on the 
same footing with other subjects of instruction, and satisfactory work be required 
from every student who is a candidate for a degree. 
A word may be said in respect to the kind of officer that should be detailed to 
college work. Not every officer is fitted by nature and training to become a suc- 
cessful college instructor. No officer who seeks an easy berth should be detailed 
to the college, but one who likes to work with young men, who is possessed of 
scholarly tastes and habits, who has a lofty ideal of the true soldier’s character 
and life, and who, in cooperation with the president and faculty, infuses a worthy 
military spirit into the young men, and will aid in the development of a type of 
strong, self-reliant, loyal manhood which this country will ever need. 
The union of military training with the development of the civic spirit in the 
education of our young men will dower this nation with a reserve corps of citizen 
soldiers unsurpassed in excellence by any age or in any land. 
III. 
  WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN OUR COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE? 
By Dr. H. C. Wurre, President Georgia State College, University of Georgia. 
I am asked to discuss, in a short paper, the subject ‘‘ What should be taught in 
our colleges of agriculture?” The use of the possessive pronoun in the title some- 
what limits, or at least gives definiteness to the range of the discussion. The 
question, I take it, is not ‘What should be taught in a college of agriculture,” 
but rather, ‘‘What should be taught in the colleges whose representatives are 
brought together in this association.” The distinction is important in its bearing 
upon thediscussionin hand. In order to determine what should be taught therein, 
it is proper toinquire what a ‘‘ college of agriculture” is or should be. Assuming 
“agriculture” to be a distinct profession or pursuit in which men are to engage 
who are specifically and technically trained to that end, I can very well under- 
stand that there might be a college or school of agriculture as there are col-

       CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 437 
leges or schools of medicine, law, theology, engineering, music, art, and other 
so-called ‘‘ professions.” In such event the college of agriculture, in determining 
what and how it should teach, could probably do no better than to follow closely 
the example set by these other professional schools in the character and scope of 
teaching which they offer and upon which they have determined after long 
years of experience and historic development. I think it may be truly said that 
the primary function of these schools is the teaching of the great body of rules 
of practice or procedure in the several professions, with incidental exposition of 
the scientific or dogmatic principles upon which the rules are based. It is acqui- 
escence in these rules, indeed, which is ‘ professed;” the recognition of their 
reasonableness and soundness which gives character to and uniformity in the tenets 
of the profession. Now, in order that such teaching may not be the mere incul- 
cation of blind empiricism, these institutions take for granted (at least, the best 
of them do and all of them should) that their matriculates have already been 
educated; have had their stores of general information, their powers of observa- 
tion and their faculties of reasoning already developed by the educative processes 
of the school, the academy, and the college. 
Law, medicine, theology, etc., are ‘‘learned professions” not so much because 
the pursuit of them necessarily develops learning, but because, properly, only 
those should engage in them who are already learned in the sense that they are 
truly educated and so equipped that they are properly prepared to acquire increas- 
ing learning with increasing years. The schools which teach these professions 
are in fact (or should be) technical training schools in special lines. They are 
not truly, except incidentally, educational institutions at all. So, perhaps, should 
be a true “college of agriculture.” 
Now, I do not say that the practice of ‘‘agriculture” may not eventually be 
(or, indeed, is not now, for that matter) competent of exposition in a code of 
general rules of procedure such as those which are accepted as at the basis of the 
practice of law, medicine, or theology. But I think we must all admit, at least, 
that as yet these rules have not been framed to what our distinguished friend, Dr. 
Harris, so aptly characterizes as a ‘‘ pedagogic form.” As yet they have not been 
so systematized as to come within the province of the teacher. So long as this is 
true, in the sense which I have endeavored to convey, a genuine ‘‘college of agri- 
culture” is, perhaps, without existence or the possibility thereof. 
Undoubtedly it is extremely desirable that this great industrial art, the practice 
of which in these latter days has become, indeed, worthy to rank as a learned 
profession by reason of the manifold applications possible therein of the great 
stores of learning achieved in many of the branches of human investigation and 
research—particularly in the physical sciences—should speedily have its rules of 
procedure reduced to such form as will bring them within the legitimate domain 
of the ‘‘pedagogue”—he who ‘‘leads the children” to think and act aright in all 
the works of their heads and hands. We who form this association are, perhaps, 
of all men those most interested to that end. One object of this immediate dis- 
cussion, no doubt, is to elicit an exchange of views upon that subject. Waiving 
this point for the moment, however, and turning to consideration of “our” 
colleges—what is it that should be taught in them? 
As most clearly setting forth the objects and character of these institutions, I 
will be pardoned for quoting the familiar text of the laws establishing them. 
Each of them is a ‘‘ college”—not an academy or a school; its function ‘to pro- 
mote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes; ” its, “leading 
object * * * to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture 
and the mechanic arts, * * * without excluding other scientific and classical 
studies, and including military tactics;’’ and each is under obligations to devote a 
portion of its revenues to giving ‘‘instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts,    
    
-P-A-G-E-518
  438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the English language, and the various branches of mathematical, physical, nat- 
ural, and economic science, with special reference to their applications in the indus- 
tries of life.” I quote the law in this discussion concerning what we should teach 
in our colleges, because where its requirements are specific we are bound as hon- 
est men to observe them. Were they all specific and explicit, there would be no 
need of this discussion. What we desire to arrive at is an interpretation of the 
general requirements of the law and acourse of procedure which shall best fulfill 
its spirit and intent. 
Dealing first, then, with the specific injunctions. Our institutions are to be 
educational establishments, not professional schools. They are to contribute to 
the drawing out and direction of the intellectual powers of the youth of the land— 
particularly of the ‘‘ industrial classes”—so that they may be properly fitted by 
“liberal and practical” education to engage in ‘the several pursuits and pro- 
fessions in life.” They are ‘‘ colleges”—and this designation helps us to determina- 
tion of the stage in the educational process where our work should properly and 
profitably begin. With the differing conditions surrounding the institutions in 
different localities, it is obvious that no fixed and uniform regulations can be laid 
down upon this point. The subject of entrance requirements to colleges gener- 
ally—in what topics and to what degree—is engaging the earnest attention of 
foremost educators in associations similar to our own, and, for our colleges, of 
an able and learned committee of this body. Excellent ideals are set to which it 
is sincerely hoped we may all ultimately be enabled to attain, uniformly, in all 
parts of our common country. As yet, however, this is manifestly not practica- 
ble. Time may make it possible. So far as ‘“ our” institutions are concerned, I 
think we might properly and safely demand of applicants for admission thereto 
that they should exhibit the same or equivalent measure of intellectual develop- 
ment and acquirement (in ‘‘liberal” culture, at least) as is required by other col- 
legiate institutions in the same or similar localities. Our teaching should begin 
at a corresponding stage. 
While upon this point permit me to indulge in a few reflections of a general 
nature, which are yet pertinent to this discussion. 
1. Obviously there is no warrant in law or reason for the distinctive designation 
of our colleges as “agricultural” or “mechanical.” f think it a pity that the 
habit has grown among us. ‘‘Land-grant,” or ‘‘State,” or ‘‘science” would be 
more fitting appellations if distinctiveness is desired. ‘Agricultural experiment 
station ” is an eminently proper name for our stations. It indicates just what they 
are. ‘Agricultura! ” or ‘‘mechanical ” prefixed to our colleges is unwarranted, 
to say the least, and is apt to be misleading. 
2. I think it unfortunate that the word “classes” occurs in the Federal act of 
endowment. There should be no ‘“‘classes” known to the law in this Republic. 
Surely we should recognize none in the construction of our schemes of education. 
3. If, as we believe (otherwise our professions are a deceit and our occupation 
a fraud), the proper, acceptable, and successful prosecution of the great industrial 
pursuits—agriculture, the mechanic arts, and other—demand an education and 
a degree of culture, both ‘‘liberal and practical,” no whit less thorough and no 
lower in order than is required for engagement in other pursuits, we should take 
care that nothing which we set forth in the curricula of our colleges shall be a 
confession of the weakness of our faith or capable of construction into an admis- 
sion that our education develops less worthy men, less able thinkers, less compe- 
tent leaders of their fellows, or leads to less honorable or dignified pursuits than 
that which is furnished by other collegiate institutions. 
We should never forget. that our colleges are one important fruit of the memo- 
rable conflict, actively begun a half century ago and waged and won within our 
generation, between science and dogma, for the recognition of the study of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 439 
  phys‘cal sciences as a legitimate and necessary factor in genuine education. 
They were born of this conflict, the victory in which was a triumph of modern 
enlightenment over ancient narrowness, a decision that new elements should be 
introduced into our educative processes, not to supplant but to reenforce the old, 
that the two together might contribute to the formation of a completer man. 
The successors of the victors would woefully misapply the fruits of the victory if 
the institutions which they set up should deliberately embrace the very errors 
which were combated to give them life, and exhibit a narrowness and one-sided- 
ness in their curricula which, although of opposite tendency, would be no less 
fatal to the development of the perfect man than those which in the older institu- 
tions were condemned. The laws creating our colleges not only permit us to 
guard against this danger; they enjoin us so to do, The provisions of the law are 
in accordance with the wise and reasonable views on the subject of education 
which guided the conflict referred to to its successful termination. Efficient 
hewers of wood and drawers of water and skilful artisans there were in abun- 
dance before the blessed enactment of 1862. This was not designed to add to their 
numbers or to perpetuate their guilds. It was intended to increase the learning 
of the youth of the land, to furnish them with intellectual powers and stores of 
knowledge especially applicable in the industrial pursuits, by providing liberally 
for education to that end, in order that those who might engage in such pursuits 
should no longer be mere slaves of a craft, but freemen in the intelligent prosecu- 
tion of their chosen handiwork. 
The specific subjects enjoined by the law to be taught are: 
1. Military tactics.—As a lover of peace and of all agencies in the body politic 
which conduce thereto, I should be inclined, individually, to say—except for the 
physical training involved and because of the association—more’s the pity; but, 
as we have it to do, let us do it thoroughly and well—not necessarily to the extent 
of placing our students under military discipline, which, personally, I deprecate 
for many cogent reasons, but as efficiently, consonant with its peculiar character, 
as we propose to instruct in other branches embraced in the curriculum. 
2. Agriculture and the mechanic arts,—Let me waive discussion of these for the 
moment, : 
The nonspecific injunctions of the law are certainly general enough to weigh 
upon the conscience of no man who is a wise educator. They should be so, for, 
obviously, differing conditions in revenues, locality, character of students, and 
other will make necessary differences in the curricula of the colleges—both in the 
number of branches taught and in the relative importance assigned them. 
‘*Branches of learning related to agriculture and the mechanic arts,” ‘‘ without 
excluding other scientific and classical studies;” ‘‘the various branches of mathe- 
matical, physical, natural, and economic science, with special reference to their 
applications in the industries of life.” Surely, so far as the letter of the law is 
concerned, the strictest constructionist could not assert that anything having the 
faintest shadow of a claim to be considered a branch of education might not be 
taught in our colleges. The great purpose of our colleges may be gatherd from 
both the letter and the spirit of the law. It is to furnish a ‘‘liberal and practical 
education,” suitable for those who may be expected to engage in industrial pur- 
suits. Without entering into discussion (which would be interminable) of what 
is or may be meant by the “liberal” and the “‘ practical” in education, I think we 
all recognize that there are certain great groups of studies which differ somewhat 
in their educative purposes and methods, although their ultimate aim is the same, 
and it is not always easy to determine, for a given study, to which group it 
more particularly belongs; the one devoted mainly to redecraft, the other to 
handcraft; the one dealing mainly with the mind, the other with the sense; the 
one characterized sometimes as “literary,” the other as ‘‘scientific.” Both are 
necessary in judicious education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
  440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  Our colleges are called upon to furnish both, but this does not mean that they 
are to exhaust the field in either direction or to be uniform in the branches which 
they adopt, or in the relative importance they may assign them. I venture to say 
that, personally, I should consider certain branches as universally essential, each 
to be pursued to the extent commonly covered bya college course. These are: In 
redecraft, the English language and literature, mathematics, psychology; in hand- 
craft, drawing and the physical sciences—physics, chemistry, and biology—with 
regular and ample laboratory work in each. To these fundamentals it is possible, 
and may be desirable, to make many additions on either hand. In redeculture, 
the classical and foreign languages, history, economics, moral science. In hand- 
culture, subdivisions of the physical sciences to any extent which may be practi- 
cable or desirable, mineralogy, geology, workshop mechanics, and the elements of 
technology in various lines. The pedagogic value of these differ with differing 
circumstances, and each college should carefully determine for itself those best 
suited to its special conditions. One thing, however, I thinkshould constantly be 
borne in mind in the conduct of this, the truly educational work of the colleges. 
In teaching the ‘‘ branches of learning related to agriculture and the mechanic 
arts” we should make it clearly appear that they are so related. In the liberal 
culture given by study of the masterpieces of our English tongue, for example, 
selections might readily and preferably be made to show that correct speaking 
and writing, a pleasing stylein composition and expression, adherence to the rules 
of rhetoric, and even, perhaps, a touch of the breath of poetic inspiration are as 
becoming and necessary in one who speaks and writes of the industrial occupa- 
tions of the people as of him who declaims of their rights and liberties upon the 
stump or discusses their political problems in the columns of the press. The evo- 
lution of civilization presented by the study of history may be as well, if not bet- 
ter shown by emphasizing the part played therein by peaceful industries as by 
recountal of battles and sieges and the lineagesof kings. Patriotism may beincul- 
cated no less through proper pride excited by the industrial achievements of our 
country in its times of peace than by panegyric of its glories won in times of war. 
Illustrations necessary to demonstrate natural laws in science may be taken 
from the myriad examples furnished upon the farm, in the field, and in the work- 
shop, which will serve at least equally as well the purposes of pure science as 
those arranged artificially in the laboratories or on the lecture table. Where 
differentiation is found possible, moreover, in the physical sciences, those branches 
should be selected which relate most directly to industrial pursuits, provided, 
always, that a proper pedagogic method is afforded and a genuine scientific spirit 
be maintained, Soil physics, agricultural chemistry, botany, entomology, and 
animal nutrition may serve for truly educative purposes as furnishing illustrations 
of principles in the study of the pure sciences, physics, chemistry, and biology. 
In fine, while it is not necessary nor is it proper that we should erect our colleges 
into unreasoning partisans of the industrial arts, as in antagonism with other 
pursuits, yet we should make manifest to our students by illustrations drawn 
therefrom in our educative processes, by the teachings of history, and by exhibi- 
tion of their proper and legitimate fruits that through them lies a path to useful- 
ness and happiness at least equal in stability and dignity to those offered by other 
occupations and professions. 
So much for the educational work of our colleges. What shall we say to the 
injunction to teach “agriculture and the mechanic arts?” How far may we go, 
andin what manner, to make our colleges, in part, training schools in distinct 
pursuits? This, I take it, is the point of most interest in the present discussion. 
First, then, as to agriculture: While my opinions are merely tentative, and I can 
not be said to have yet reached positive convictions on the subject, but with a fair 
acquaintanceof what is doing at home and abroad in this particular, I am inclined
-P-A-G-E-521
  
  CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 441 
to think that the school of agriculture should be a school of demonstration, not of 
attempted education. 
The professor of agriculture (if there be one) should teach neither physics, nor 
chemistry, nor biology, nor engineering, nor any parts thereof, under the titles of 
soil physics, agricultural chemistry, stock breeding, farm surveying, and the like. 
He should rather demonstrate the applications of the previously taught principles 
of pure science in the operations of the farm. The school of agriculture should 
be provided with a suitable farm, including orchards, garden, and dairy, each 
equipped in the best manner possible, with proper buildings, stock, cattle, and 
machinery, and each should be conducted regularly and systematically as a model 
of its kind in illustration of the proper and best methods of actual practice in the 
several branches of agricultural industry. The students of the college should be 
admitted to witness, and, if need be, to take part in the operations, and the dem- 
onstrator in each should be competent and required to give explanation of the 
processes and the reasoning underlying them. It can readily be seen that the num- 
ber of these processes may be very great, including preparation and tillage of 
land, drainage, irrigation, feeding and care of stock, breeding of cattle, vegetable 
and fruit culture, butter and cheese making, the housing, preparation, and mar- 
keting of farm products, and a great number of others. The point I particularly 
make is that these operations should be illustrative, and, in every case, performed 
in the very best manner that science and experience direct. The school of agri- 
culture should be the clinic of the college; in a manner it should bear the same 
relation to the college that the hospital bears to the college of medicine. It should 
be designed primarily for those who have already received, or are at the same 
time receiving, the educative culture of the college proper, and it should not 
undertake to duplicate or infringe upon the pedagogic work of the college. This 
may seem unnecessary to say, but perhaps it is not soso long as it not infrequently 
happens that a ‘“‘professor of agriculture” conceives it his duty to give lecture- 
room instruction to his classes in smatterings of botany, agricultural chemistry, 
vegetable and animal physiology, and other such topics which properly belong to 
the departments of the several special physical sciences, where they can be taught 
much better and with a proper regard to the period in the student’s education 
where they should be introduced, and since most of our text-books on so-called 
“agriculture” follow the same general plan in their treatment of the subject. 
Although certain of these topics may in strictness be considered of the nature of 
applied rather than of pure science, they are in the main such as should enter into 
the education of any man of liberal culture, and should not be estimated as the 
peculiar possession of those only who purpose entering the industrial pursuits. So 
far as the text-books are concerned, perhaps it is not possible to follow any other 
plan, since the practice of agriculture can only be taught by actual demonstration. 
When what they do is well done—as is the case in the admirable little manual of 
our friend Professor Voorhees—these books serve a most useful purpose, but 
should not be taken as exemplifying the course to be given by the professors of 
agriculture in our colleges. 
Again, this illustrative work and training of the college farm and its attach- 
ments should be distinct from the research work, in its several lines, of the exper- 
iment station. It is unquestionably eminently advantageous and desirable that 
the station should be intimately associated with the college; particularly for the 
sake of the station, but for the sake of the college as well. For that matter an 
investigator in one might very well be (and preferably) a teacher in the other, 
and advanced or graduate students of the college might be admitted to participa- 
tion in the researches of the station, but the work in each should be distinct, and, 
while they should cooperate and aid each other whenever possible, the distinctive 
purposes and functions of each should be carefully discriminated. In connection 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  with technical training in handcraft, instruction might properly be given in the 
school of agriculture in farm management and economics, in the history of agri- 
culture in all its branches, and in the systematic and critical study of agricultural 
literature. 
So much for agriculture. Instruction in the mechanic arts—into which subject 
I may not enter—I take it should follow the same general lines, the workshops 
taking the place of the farm. 
Now, I am aware that I have mapped out an amount of work for our colleges 
which is stupendous; either the educative work or the illustrative work is alone 
very great; the entirety—to us of small means, especially—is simply appalling. 
It will rarely, perhaps never, happen that any one of our colleges can do it all. 
But I submit that it would be wise to follow the general policy which is herein out- 
lined. Let each college do what it can and make its selection among the lines of 
work offered according to its means and the conditions surrounding it. Upon cer- 
tain points I should be inclined to insist in all cases. 
1. That our colleges should be colleges in fact as well asin name. They should 
be educational institutions in higher learning, in which the physical sciences par- 
ticularly should fill their proper and important place as educative branches. They 
should be true colleges, requiring, on the one hand, of those admitted to them a 
certain proper degree of previous education, and on the other stopping short of 
the specialization in distinct branches which constitutes in pure sciences the proper 
work of the university, and, in certain of the applied sciences, of the experiment 
station. 
2. That they should provide the necessary and proper amount of this educational 
work first of all, and should never permit themselves to become the nurseries of 
unlettered craftsmen in the industrial arts, however skillful. This need not nec- 
essarily exclude from certain of the technical courses those who are seeking 
information rather than education, but care should be taken that the chief func- 
tion of the college is educational, not informational. 
Where the land-grant college subsists exclusively upon its Federal revenues, it 
must, perforce, be modest in its aspirations. Should other collegiate institutions 
exist in the community with which it may cooperate, so that it may require of 
those admitted to it a previous reasonable degree of college education, then its 
work may legitimately be given over chiefly to the demonstrative teaching which 
Thaveindicated. Best of all, perhaps, is the arrangement, when it is feasible, of 
such intimate and local association with other collegiate institutions as will pro- 
vide for the educative and leave the bulk of the revenues of the college available 
for the technical, demonstrative work. Such an arrangement as—my friend Pro- 
fessor Bailey will permit me to say—is so admirably administered at Cornell Uni- 
versity in the State of New York, for example, certainly leaves nothing to be 
desired. I am quite well aware that ‘‘many men, many minds,” and that an 
arrangement of a given character which might be admirable in one locality and 
under one set of conditions might not work well in another locality and under 
different circumstances. Iam discussing the question purely from an ideal stand- 
point. In any event, whatever may be the conditions, redecraft (in its. best and 
thorough signification) should precede, or at least accompany, handcraft, however 
thorough this may be. In no other way in my judgment can our colleges serve 
the great purpose for which they were founded—to make of the industrial pur- 
suits intellectual occupations to be engaged in by educated men. Our colleges 
must give such good, genuine, broad education to their students as will equip 
them with mentality requisite to cope successfully with their fellows in the intel- 
lectual struggles of life or else they fail of their purpose, become a laughing stock 
of scholars and a hurt rather than a blessing to the community.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.1 
By Dr. C. S. MURKLAND, 
President New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. 
  Mr. CHAIRMAN, MEMBERS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF AGRICULTURE, 
AND FRrEnDs: It is with great pleasure that I avail myself of your permission to 
speak here to-day. . It occurred to me while your chairman was speaking that 
undoubtedly one of the reasons why the New Hampshire College was moved 
nearer to your border was because of the strong attractive tendency of the State 
of Massachusetts, naturally drawing us by its educational energy; and I am very 
sure that all we in New Hampshire who are interested in education are delighted 
to get nearer Massachusetts, either locally or in spirit, in purpose and in method, 
The necessity of condensing what I might wish to say in the time allotted me 
has compelled me to leave some important matters utterly unmentioned, and to 
briefly touch upon others, simply commenting upon a few points; for the subject 
of industrial education is not one which can be disposed of in a few words—it 
is a subject which touches vitally the interests of our people. Without further 
introduction, let me say: 
It is the misfortune of educational movements that they have always to deal 
not only with the resistance of ultraconservatism, but also with the impatience of 
impetuous radicalism. On the one hand is the drag of objection, on the score that 
that which has been good enough before is good enough now; and on the other 
hand is the strain of insistance upon perfection, as if educational methods and 
results might spring forth fully developed, as Minerva was said to spring fully 
equipped from the head of Jove. One class of people clamors against anything 
largely new in educational methods and purposes, while another class clamors, 
with equal vehemence, for such development of the newer methods and such 
definition of the newer purposes as haye been gained for the older education 
only by the experience of centuries. To clearly understand this double strain 
is to get at the heart of the difficulties in the way of industrial education, and to 
get at the heart of the difficulty is at the same time to gain an understanding of 
the position of industrial education, in this country as in other lands. 
Industrial education, which may be defined as education having in view imme- 
diate application in some of the pursuits and professions of life, is at present 
involved in some necessary confusion in this country because of the difficulties 
it has met on either hand. It was inevitable that so great an innovation as 
that embodied in the changes from the traditional and time-honored methods of 
education should, for its definite development, require much more time than has 
yet elapsed since the first institution for industrial training was established. An 
expression used by Dr. William T.: Harris, the United States Commissioner of 
Education, in a recent address, will be found useful in making this fact clear, In 
that address? he spoke of a ‘‘pedagogical form” as a necessity in teaching any 
subject. And by the phrase “‘ pedagogical form” is meant a series of lessons so 
arranged that they shall be actually progressive. In mathematics, to use the 
illustration Dr. Harris himself used, there is a definite progression in which each 
lesson plainly follows the lesson before it and demands that the preceding lesson 
shall have been mastered. In mathematics and the classics the ‘‘ pedagogical 
form” has been developed by long trial and is essentially fixed. There may be

  changes in text-books; it may be questioned whether or not Cesar shall follow the 
lessons in easy Latin, the fables, and short historical extracts; but the teaching 
form is not therebyaffected. One who has to teach mathematics has no difficulty 
in deciding which place in the course shall be held by analytical geometry, for 
instance. He has only to decide what text-book will best suit his classes by being 
best adapted to the requirements of the pedagogical form under the circumstances 
in which he finds those classes. The same is true of him who has to teach the 
classics, or even the modern languages. 
In the matter of language the form is less definitely determined than in the case 
of mathematics, but it is still fairly well defined. It certainly is to be questioned 
whether or not there has been any improvement upon the system which simply 
took the ‘‘ pedagogical form ” used in teaching the classics and applied it to teach- 
ing the modern languages. The main tact, however, is clear; in the older educa- 
tion, represented by the teaching in the classical colleges, there has been the 
advantage derived from established forms, by which both the process and the 
result of the teaching have been essentially fixed. 
Industrial education, on the other hand, has lacked this advantage; and, lacking 
this, it has lacked that which can be gained only through the experience of many 
years, and by the tentative trials of many institutions during these years. Indus- 
trial education in this country, as in Europe, is too young to have arrived at the 
maturity which will represent what such education is when at its best. And this 
which is true of industrial education in general is true of its different divisions. 
So that it is a thing to be expected that those departments of industrial education 
which lend themselves most readily to a teaching form should be most perfectly 
developed and therefore in the most satisfactory condition. 
Mr. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, presented a report February 
7, 1898, in which he adopted a classification separating industrial education into 
three divisions, respectively represented by the schools for manual training, the 
technical schools, and the institutes of technology. The ‘half-developed colleges 
of agriculture and the mechanics,” as he calls them, he places between the tech- 
nical or trade schools and the technological institutes of university grade, giving 
them, rightly enough, perhaps, an indefinite and rather nondescript position. 
Adopting, for convenience, his classification, it is to be noticed, first, that indus- 
trial education has been concerned with the mechanic arts and the manufacturing 
industries almost exclusively, until a very recent date. From the establishing of 
the Rensselaer Institute, at Troy, N. Y., in 1842, till to-day, engineering, in some 
of its divisions, has been the predominant department in the industrial institutions 
in the United States. Allied with mathematics as engineering always is, demand- 
ing a thorough preparation in mathematic instruction as it does, this department 
of industrial education has easily adopted the pedagogical form ready to its hand 
in the established form of mathematical teaching. In affording new details-of 
application, engineering has not had to grapple with the difficulty of supplying or 
developing the form itself; it has found the form already prepared for its use. 
This is something which should never be forgotten by those who are moved to 
speak or write upon this subject. It is easy enough, for instance, to complain that 
in the industrial or technical institutions of the country agriculture is overshad- 
owed by mechanics. It ought to be easy to see that while this may be the case, 
while it is naturally, even necessarily, the case, it is so simply asa temporary 
phase of the general problem of industrial education. It is not that one depart- 
ment is held in higher regard than another. It is simply that one department 
found a teaching form ready to its use, while another faced, and faces still, the 
necessity of developing its own form. No one has advanced a form for teach- 
ing agriculture, for instance, so definite, so well arranged in progressive sequence, 
that it could be generally adopted as, on the whole, a satisfactory method for uni- 
versal use. It may be safely prophesied .that no one will suggest such a form for

  some years to come, And the institutions in which agriculture is taught are 
thrown thereby into a confusion which is for the present practically inextricable. 
What requirements shall be demanded of the students who enter such institu- 
tions? How shall the studies apportioned to the successive years be determined? 
How long shall the prescribed course be? What degree shall be conferred upon 
completion of the course? These are questions which find answers as many as 
there are institutions involved. And this confusion can not be reduced to order 
until it is possible to apply to every department in such institutions some well- 
defined form of teaching, such that the progress in one department shall be as defi- 
nite and as real as the allied progress in every other department. 
Lhave singled out the department of agriculture for illustration for two reasons: 
First, because I assume that a session of the Massachusetts board of agriculture 
is interested chiefly in teaching agriculture; and, secondly, because the department 
of agriculture in our institutions of industrial education is the department which 
suffers most from the lack of definite form in teaching. The same considerations 
lead me, at this point, to dwell upon the relation between agriculture and other 
departments of industrial education. 
We have always to consider the end to be attained in education. Few parents 
would be satisfied if their sons were to receive from the institution they attend 
nothing but the training which would preparethem for the mere drudgery of the 
occupation they choose. Wood-working and iron-working are included in the 
mechanical courses not simply that the students may be fitted to be carpenters 
and machinists; students must master preliminary details for the sake of larger 
constructive operations. A boy may learn the carpenter’s trade by an apprentice- 
ship of three years, and be paid for his work all the time. It would hardly pay 
him to go to a technical school for four years, meeting the necessary expenses out 
of his own pocket or out of the treasury of the State or the nation, only to gain 
such skill as he might be paid for acquiring in less time. A simple trade school, 
which attempts nothing but to produce skilled artisans, can justify its being only 
by turning out better workmen than the shop can turn out, or by reducing the 
time of apprenticeship, or by adding something which an apprentice would not 
learn. Asa matter of fact, the technical schools of the lower grade do not attempt 
to reduce the term of apprenticeship, requiring, as they commonly do, more than 
three years’ time. Nor do they, asa rule, claim to produce better artisans. A 
journeyman carpenter will not have spent over the construction of perfect joints 
so much time as the graduate of a trade school, but he will have gained much 
more in deftness and quick facility in the use of tools. On the whole, the journey- 
man carpenter who has served his apprenticeship will be a better carpenter for 
general work than the school graduate. Itis not by giving the same instruction 
in a shorter time, nor yet in giving better instruction covering the same ground, 
that a technical school must show its superiority to the school of apprenticeship; 
but it is in adding to the mere technical training such other instruction as shall 
better equip the learner for his place among men. Industrial education must be 
more than learning and teaching trades; more, even, than adding to the develop- 
ment of technical skill a certain ability to apply general principles to the details 
of ahandicraft. It must fit the learner for life—for the life a man must lead 
among men; and that is something more than the life a carpenter must lead 
among carpenters, or a machinist among machinists, or a farmer among farmers, 
This is vital in any consideration of the nature, the purposes, or the methods of 
industrial education. And until we have found how the technical institution 
may best fit its students for the large relations which they must sustain, always 
having in view the special vocation and also the general human obligations, we 
shall not have solved the problem of industrial education. 
This has its immediate bearing upon the relation between agricultural and other 
departments of industrial education, and in this way: With such material for
-P-A-G-E-526
446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  teaching as is now available, there is no perspective possible in teaching agri- 
culture. Arranging different courses of study in’a general agricultural course is 
as nearly haphazard a process as anything can be in matters of instruction. 
Coming fresh from a convention of the so-called agricultural colleges of the 
country, I am sure of my ground when I say that this is a common fact in the 
experience of these institutions. Certain text-books may be assigned to the senior 
year in one of these colleges, with absolutely no reason why they should not have 
been assigned to the freshman year, or, for that matter, to some year of the pre- 
paratory school course. Where there is any perspective it is afforded by the 
dependence of agriculture upon some more definitely formulated scientific study, as 
in the cases where an understanding of elementary chemistry is involved. In other 
words, teaching agriculture gains the perspective of a pedagogical form only when 
it adopts the form determined by some more precisely formulated science; and 
where no such other science is involved there is nothing of that orderly sequence 
in the progress of the instruction which has made the classical education, and 
in some degree the scientific education, a process commanding respect by the 
intellectual development it inevitably implies. 
Tam anxious to make this clear, even at the risk of some repetition. Here are 
sixty so-called agricultural colleges, or thereabout, each attempting to give as 
complete instruction in agriculture as is possible, and I suppose everyone of them 
has to withstand the diverse strains of which I spoke at the outset; on the one 
hand the inertia of the sentiment which sneers at scientific farming, and on the 
other hand the strain of the foolish impatience of those who can not understand 
that until agriculture is reduced to a science it can not be taught as a science, 
Reduced to a science agriculture certainly has not been. It involves some smat- 
tering of scientific knowledge; mainly, as has been indicated, of elementary chem- 
istry. But that farmers are able to speak of potash and phosphoric acid and 
nitrogen and albuminoids and carbohydrates, hopeful as this is as a promise for 
the future, is not a demonstration that agriculture itself is even approximating to 
the exactness of a natural science. It has hardly attempted to use the scientific 
method of careful and exact observation of facts with reference to large generali- 
zations. How could it be otherwise? What inducement has there been for men * 
to regard their farming in the light of a scientific possibility? The patient, pains- 
taking accuracy, the willingness to wait long for apparently meager results, the 
disregard of immediate financial return—such qualities as these, all factors of 
the scientific spirit, have had little opportunity to exercise themselves in the 
details of tilling the soil. The wisdom of the National Government in establish- 
ing experiment stations has begun to afford such an opportunity, but only the 
veriest beginning can have been made in seven years, and the agriculturists them- 
selyes have hardly as yet been willing to unite with these stations in carrying out 
the work which demands such general cooperation. Until there is a science of 
agriculture, as there shall be some day, there can not be any satisfactory teaching 
of agriculture worthy of a college name or a collegiate degree, and the agricul- 
tural colleges may face the facts. 
Again, if there were a well-defined science of agriculture, it would not in itself 
constitute a complete industrial education. We might, even now, do what some 
of the frequent contributors to the agricultural papers seem to demand, and give 
instruction beginning, say, with the method of cutting and carrying wood for the 
kitchen fire. Then we might proceed to show how to handle a shovel, a spade, a 
two-tined fork, and a four-tined one, and so on. But it is hardly probable that 
- boys would go to a college, or whatever the institution might be called, to learn 
that which they are not too willing to practice at home, where they have at least 
board and washing and clothes furnished them. Asin the case with trade schools, 
the agricultural college can justify its being, not by giving the training which 
might have been given on the home farm, nor yet by compressing that same train-

  ing into fewer years, but by adding to it something which shall tend to make the 
student a better farmer, a better man, and a better citizen on his farm. It was 
profound wisdom which united the mechanic arts with agriculture in the funda- 
mental law establishing the various colleges. Where there are institutions 
designed to be exclusively agricultural, as in Massachusetts, the same advantage 
is gained by broadening the course of study so that it shall embrace many branches 
which are general rather than technical. These studies benefit the agricultural 
course from the fact that they are not themselves agricultural. They make it 
possible for the student to gain that personal development which makes for gen- 
eral fitness rather than for special aptitude, and they also ally the more specific- 
ally agricultural studies with other studies which have a teaching form already 
fixed. It would be no benefit to agriculture if we could succeed in forcing an 
institution to cut out everything in its curriculum which is not directly and 
immediately technical. No more deadly blow could be struck at the agriculture 
of the future than would be struck if such a movement should be made universal 
or even general. Technical education as applied to agriculture is incomplete so 
far as it is exclusive. It needs, as other branches of technical education do not 
in the same degree, the help of other studies, technical or general; for, lacking the 
form of progressive sequence, it lacks the first educational requirement. It will 
not insure the general development of the pupil, nor will it even fit him for the 
profession of agriculture. 
It may seem as if I had conceded too much in granting, as I have, that technical 
education as applied to agriculture is confused, immature, and not upon a level 
with other departments of technical education. But there is some hope in it, 
for there is nothing in the method of instruction in agriculture to prevent such 
reconstruction or such gradual improvement as may be suggested by longer experi- 
ence. The name ‘agricultural college” is, I suppose, a designation which is likely 
to be permanent. But the agricultural colleges will never command the respect 
which other colleges command until they earn it. No decree, no legislation, cer- 
tainly no declamation, will elevate the institution which is not exalted by its own 
worth. One of two things, and probably both of them, our agricultural colleges 
must do if they are not always to be considered, as many people now consider 
them, institutions where a partial education may be gained, an education dis- 
tinctly lower, upon the whole, than that of the classical college. Either the agri- 
cultural college must produce men who are far on the road to eminence in their 
chosen specialty, or it must produce men able to maintain their places side by side 
with the bachelors of arts from other colleges. If the institution aims to produce 
eminent specialists, and only these, its constituency will be reduced to narrow 
limits; if it aims to send forth specialists, and at the same time to give as com- 
plete general development as any institution can give in the same time, there is no 
reason why the agricultural college may not have a constituency practically unlim- 
ited and win for its name genuine honor. So long as either agricultural or tech- 
nical education is of greatest interest to us, we ought not to rest until the agricul- 
tural college is recognized as the equal of any college in the land. 
There may be some points of detail which should not be entirely overlooked, 
for many questions arise, questions which must be answered somewhere, and which 
may not unfittingly be asked here. At what point shall the technical education, 
specifically that pertaining to agriculture, begin? What shall be accepted as sufii- 
cient for admission to the technical college, the college of agriculture, for instance? 
How long shall the course be? What kind of testimonial or degree shall be con- 
ferred at the end of the course? These are living questions, and will not soon be 
finally answered. But some suggestions, with principles back of them, may be 
made, 
Naturally one begins with the last, for the end determines the beginning as 
truly as the beginning conditions the end. And, in the first place, there should 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
448 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  be no degree representing four years of college residence which can be regarded. 
as of less worth, less honorable, than any other degree representing the same 
expenditure of time. If at the end of four years spent in one college there is a 
bachelor’s degree conferred, making the bachelor of arts a person of rightful dis- 
tinction, the agricultural college ought not to confer a degree which may be con- 
sidered as less honorable as is the degree of bachelor of science. I think I hazard 
nothing in saying that the letters B.S. attached to a graduate’s name do not carry 
so much weight as the letters B. A., and that is not so very much. This whole 
matter could be greatly simplified, and would be, if it were a settled principle that 
the degree of A. B. means that the one receiving it has, after a definite preparation, 
satisfactorily completed a four years’ course of study in an institution of collegiate 
grade—it does not matter what the course, scientific, technical, or classical. This 
suggestion is not new, nor is it original with me; but I am convinced that it is cor- 
rect in principle, and that if it should be applied to the so-called agricultural 
colleges it would be to the general benefit of industrial education, perhaps of all 
education. 
But this assumes that the institution is of collegiate grade; and the grade of an 
institution is largely determined by the requirements of admission toit. Wecan not 
admit students with poor preparation or with no preparation at all, and with such 
material maintain a standard of scholarship worthy of the collegiate name. The 
question of the degree thus involves the question as to the length of the course 
and the question as to the requirements for admission. As tolength of the course, 
it should not be less than four years, unless a shorter time—three years, for 
instance—be accepted in other institutions conferring the same degree and having 
the same requirements for admission. 
President Eliot suggests that three years ought to be enough; but this is entirely 
a question as to the starting point. With a preparation covering a year’s work 
more than is covered commonly by applicants for admission, the college course 
might be reduced to three years’ time; but with preparation under the ordinary 
standards of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the other States of New Eng- 
land, it will take four years to produce -the development of mind without which 
there ought to be no degree conferred, of A. B. or B.S. This does not mean, 
necessarily, that there must not be shorter courses, requiring less and giving less. 
But the degree should be the same for equivalent attainment in all institutions. 
In the department of agriculture it may be possible that a course of two years 
would appeal to many young men to whom a course of four years would seem 
like an impossibility. On the other hand, however, is the danger that a course of 
but two years, with a certificate, of course, not a degree, at the end of it, would 
tend to lower the standard of the institution, and thus indirectly defraud every 
graduate who has pursued the full course and thus become entitled to standing as 
a bachelor of arts. A short course in agriculture is an acknowledgment of the 
truth of which I have spoken—that in teaching agriculture there is no determined 
form of progressive sequence. It may also be a confession that the graduate in 
agriculture is not to be considered equal with the graduate in other departments. 
So far as this is the meaning of it, the short course is to be unqualifiedly con- 
demned. In any case the question of preliminary requirements is involved. For 
the candidate for the short course is almost inevitably one who is not prepared for 
the full course; one, in other words, who belongs in a preparatory school, not ina 
college. The degree of A. B. should be given after satisfactory completion of the 
determined number of years’ work, but with a definite preparation assumed in 
every case. What should the preparation be? 
This is the practical difficulty in the way of industrial education. And it is to 
the honor of the Massachusetts Agricultural College that it is seeking to confer 
the greatest henefit upon its students, and thus to advance industrial education, 
by raising its standard and increasing the requirements for admission,

I wonder if you understand how much of the heroic there was in such action 
when President Goodell, together with the faculty and the trustees of that college, 
consented to raise the standard, at the risk of decreasing the numbers. It was a 
brave, honorable, manly thing for them to do; and honor will be done them for 
it as surely as truth is truth, as surely as God gives the final mastery to that which 
is right and perfect. 
Three things ought to be demanded of every candidate for collegiate standing: 
A thorough preparatory training in mathematics, up to the point now commonly 
fixed upon by our colleges; a thorough training in English. (I wish I might show 
some of the English that we get, or, at least, some of the things that are supposed 
to be English, but are not. How can you give a college training, building up the 
vast superstructure, with no foundation? We ought to demand of our public 
schools more and more insistently that they allow no boy, no girl, to go out from 
their doors without understanding something of the use, the power, and the beauty 
of the mother tongue. There is danger of giving overmuch attention to scientific 
training. We are carrying that too far—not teaching too much science, but too 
many sciences. There is a vast distinction between the two things. Instead of 
developing in our students the scientific spirit, I think we have tried to cram 
them with facts.) There should be, I say, a thorough training in English, includ- 
ing a course extending over not less than two years; a touch of scientific teaching, 
enough to make the student familiar with the scientific spirit and method, and a 
thorough discipline in some language which has a, fixed pedagogical form, prefer- 
ably Latin. The technical institution may not have Latin in its course; that is 
not at all to the point. The study of one language which can be progressively 
taught is of peculiar educational value, even if the student does not expect ever 
to use the language itself. German would serve almost as well as Latin, French 
almost as wellas German. (Greek lacks the incidental practical value of Latin, 
German, and French. But one language other than the English should be 
required as a guaranty of the preliminary fitness required by the collegiate 
standard. There should be at least three years of solid study, grinding drill, 
until the student has learned something of the formation of language, and much 
of its use. 
I know there are some who have the feeling that we can somehow absorb lan- 
guage by talking a good deal, writing a little, and reading less, and doing all with 
no particular care and application of the mind to the work. We shall not geta 
final agreement as to all this in one year or in ten years, but we have our eyes 
fixed on the future, ‘‘and wisdom is justified of her children.” 
There are matters of detail which must not be dwelt upon here. What I have 
said, in this hasty and inadequate treatment of the theme of ‘‘ Industrial educa- 
tion,” I have said because there is so large an opportunity for the board of agri- 
culture to further the cause of education, and, most of all, agricultural education. 
Indeed, to hold official position of any kind in the grand old Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts is to be under a certain educational compulsion. As representa- 
tives of the farmers, you are empowered to act in both directions—upon the resist- 
ance of those who would oppose every movement toward a scientific agriculture 
and a scientific teaching of agriculture, and upon the impatience of those for 
whom the car of progress moves tooslowly. Little by little the great problems of 
industrial education, problems not fairly appreciated until yesterday, are being 
worked out. And with the cooperation of the agriculturists themselves, with 
such unanimity as is possible when institutions and people together seek for the 
common good of all, the agricultural colleges will go on to definite aims, to wise 
and comprehensive methods, and to such general development as shall make the 
name agricultural college a true designation, and also a title of honor. 
I thank you, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, for your courtesy. There are a

thousand things I would be glad to have said. I am not sure there is anything 
that I have said which I would wish unsaid. The cause of truth is ours. Science 
and industry are God’s handmaids, as they are truths. By them we shall gain the 
consummation of human life.

CONSERVATISM IN SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURE. * 
By Prof. W. H. Jorpan, Director of the Ming ae College Agricultural Experiment Station, 
rono, Me. 
  The American Agricultural Experiment Station is this year twenty years old; 
the American College of Agriculture is older. During at least aquarter of a cen- 
tury the teacher and investigator, to a greater or less extent, have been active in 
this land of ours in their efforts to illuminate the business of the farmer with the 
beneficent light of science. 
Their success has not been startling, though great enough to justify the effort. 
Inexperience, imperfect knowledge, the immense labor of successful teaching and 
investigation, prejudice, the inertia that always attends any educational move- 
ment, all have conspired to render the attainment of the ultimate object, viz, a 
more rational practice of agriculture, slow and difficult. 
From one point of view, however, a great deal has been accomplished. Generous 
endowments, both State and national, expended by a large body of trained workers, 
an enlightened thought, and an improved farm practice testify not only to past 
achievements but to present effort on a scale that is truly marvelous, * * * 
There is at least one complaint the farmers of the United States no longer have 
the right to utter, which is, that they do not receive full recognition in the exer- 
cise of the paternal functions of the national and State governments, or in the 
growth of the means and methods of public education. Whatever may have been 
their motives, or the arguments which may have been so successfully used in 
influencing their action, the representatives of the people have, in their exercise of 
legislative authority, dealt fairly generously with the industry that feeds us all. 
Our Government may reasonably claim to have done its part up to the present 
time in the efforts that are being made to impart special education and to discover 
needed truth. 
The question which must come to the workers in college and station with great 
force and meaning is: Are we justifying this great use of time and money by what 
we are accomplishing? Is this tremendous activity that we are putting forth 
being directed along the right channels? Are those who are teaching and investi- 
gating, and who are speaking through the press or from the platform, fully recog- 
nizing the real needs of agriculture? 
It is not my purpose at this time to attempt a statistical enumeration and dis- 
cussion of our appliances for education and investigation, or to undertake a detailed 
criticism of the methods in vogue in the college and experiment station. I do pro- 
pose, however, to call attention to certain general considerations which I believe 
should have a controlling influence in the development of class-room and popular 
instruction, and in the various lines of experiment and investigation. 
The subject that is set for discussion is, Conservatism in scientific agriculture, 
which, perhaps, needs a preliminary definition as indicating the lines of thought 
which it is proposed to follow. 
The conservatism for which I would contend is that which is induced by a rec- 
ognition of three truths: 
* First. The proper cultivation of the man is fundamental to the safe develop- 
ment and right use of material resources. 
Second. The education, that in agriculture is primarily important, proceeds 
1 Read before the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, January 18, 1896. 
 
-P-A-G-E-531
CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 451 
  from instruction in the relations of matter and energy and in the scientific facts 
and principles which enter into and environ life, rather than in imparting the 
technics and manual skill of the farm. 
Third. Substantial progress in any art must be based upon an accurate knowl- 
edge of underlying truths. 
Scientific agriculture is commonly understood to be the practice of agriculture 
in accordance with the known facts and principles of science, but in our discus- 
sion to-day we will understand it to include as well the various organizations and 
activities that are auxiliary to agriculture as the means of rendering it more 
rational. Our subject involves, therefore— 
(1) The experiment station. 
(2) College and school instruction. 
(8) The farmers’ institute. 
(4) The press. 
(5) The farmer. 
These I understand to be the various agencies through which an organized effort 
is being made to convey to agricultural practices the benefits of the exact knowl- 
edge we call science. 
We will first consider, then, scientific investigation as a factor of modern agri- 
culture. This is certainly the logical order, for we must discover truth before we 
can teach it. What relation does our subject bear to the work of the experiment 
station? 
There exist, I believe, substantial reasons for the following assertion, namely: 
* * * The greatest obstacle to progress, or even safe procedure, in the art of 
agriculture now existing is an insufficient knowledge of foundation facts and 
principles. * * * 
It is worthy of note that the only investigations which have outlived a half or 
even quarter of a century, and which have exerted a profound influence upon 
agriculture as an art, are those of a severely scientific character—investigations 
which were carried on in the laboratories of scientists who little dreamed of the 
far-reaching influence of their labors. The men who have given to the word sci- 
ence the great meaning and dignity which it now has have been lovers of the 
truth for truth’s sake, and I sometimes fear that we as a people are not cultivat- 
ing the spirit of the true investigator as we should. Is it true that our scientific 
labors are taking on a merely commercial aspect? Are we asking as the intro- 
duction to every piece of scientific work the question, How much will it be worth 
in dollars and cents? 
For some, these questions fortunately can be answered in the negative. It is 
desirable, however, that the enthusiastic scientific spirit shall more thoroughly 
pervade our experiment stations, for we sorely need the inevitable outcome of 
such a spirit. While it is properly a function of the station to show how existing 
knowledge may be utilized by experiments which serve as object lessons, I believe 
a more important function at the present stage of knowledge is the discovery of 
laws and facts fundamental to agricultural methods, leaving the application to 
farm practice of much of this added knowledge largely with the mass of intelli- 
gent farmers, where, after all, it must generally be left. I affirm, then, that the 
conclusions derived from experiment station work should manifest a conservatism 
that is induced by severe and searching methods of experiment and investigation. 
Our attention will now be directed toward the work of the schools. This is of 
prime importance, because here are to be trained the men who will be influential 
in determining the status of agriculture. The standing of any profession or busi- 
ness depends not so much upon the kind of work performed as upon the character 
and quality of the men engaged in it, provided, of course, that the work is honor- 
able, If the social horizon of the tiller of the soil is narrow, it is not because he 
digs in mother earth, but is in part because of his inability to reach out to larger
-P-A-G-E-532
452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  social and intellectual opportunities. While it is not to be expected that all the 
followers of any calling shall stand in the forefront of social and intellectual life, 
it is certainly true that if agriculture is to maintain its proper dignity and influ- 
ence among the world’s great industries, politically and socially, it must number 
among its followers men of the same intellectual ability and wide range of vision 
that are found in other callings. 
Farmers have often complained that lawyers have chiefly legislated for them, 
but if this is true it is partly because they have not been shown their ability to 
determine their own political and social status. ‘The conditions that make for 
supremacy in human society are not nullified or reversed as a favor to the farmer. 
At the same time that we recognize this fact we must admit another of equal 
importance, viz, that the interests of agriculture, whether in legislation or in busi- 
ness and social conflicts, are safest in the hands of its own followers who are 
qualified by education and experience successfully to compete with opposing inter- 
ests. For these reasons, then, we are anxious that the training of the schools 
shall render the best possible service to agriculture in the preparation of its 
leaders. 
In order that this shall be accomplished, we must give place to a conservatism 
which recognizes the value of past experience in the means and methods of impart- 
ing a sound education. 
When the land-grant colleges were first organized, a popular notion prevailed 
that an entirely new order of education was to be established—that the matter and 
manner of the classical college were to be replaced by other subjects and other 
methods. The young man was to be trained to do rather than to think. The 
introduction into the curricula of these schools of such subjects as the modern 
languages, literature, and metaphysics, or even extended instruction in the sci- 
ences, was resented by many as foreign to the spirit and purpose of the act which 
made these new institutions possible. Had such views prevailed, the cause of 
technical education would have suffered great harm. These extremists forgot, or 
never knew, that a man’s mastery of affairs does not proceed primarily from mem- 
orizing a catalogue of material facts or from manual skill, but rather from his 
capacity for severe and logical thought, and that a farmer’s success is due not so 
much to his ability to plow a straight furrow or his capacity for hard labor as to 
that analytical power of mind which enables him to discern the right relation of 
things. To equip a man merely with the technics of the practice of agriculture 
would fall far short of preparing him for that larger social influence which is 
essential to leadership or the highest success. 
Fortunately, we believe, the four-years courses in agriculture, as now presented 
by our best institutions, include a fair proportion of general training subjects, 
combined with such a sequence of chemical, physical, and biological studies that 
the faithful student not only attains acultivated intellect, but is given a system- 
atic insight into the world of matter and of life with which he has to deal. Such 
courses represent the conservative position and are a logical result of the experi- 
ence of the past. 
That they do not impart sound learning and can only meet the demands of an 
inferior scholarship I do not for an instant admit. 
Tt seems, however, that some who are interested in our land-grant collges place a 
low estimate upon the educational value of courses in agriculture as they now 
exist. Certain recent utterances concerning this matter are like a dash of cold 
water in the face to those who had come to regard the agricultural course in some 
of our colleges as the peer of any other found there. 
The most notable of these utterances is the address delivered last winter before 
the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture by the able president of the New Hamp- 
shire Agricultural College. I propose, in this connection, to criticise some of the 
main points of this address, because they are based upon what, in my judgment,
-P-A-G-E-533
  CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 453 
is a serious misconception of the essentials of a four-years course in agriculture, 
and because in so doing I may be able to make clear the views I desire to present. 
Certain conclusions reached by President Murkland may be justly summarized 
as follows: 
(1) A “pedagogical form” is a ‘‘ necessity for teaching any subject,” meaning 
by pedagogical form a logical or progressive series of lessons. 
(2) The courses in mathematics and classics have taken on a fixed pedagogical 
form, which (inferentially) gives them a maximum value as a means of education. 
(3) Courses of study related to agriculture and to engineering, especially the 
former, have suffered from lack of pedagogical form. 
(4) Engineering, because so closely allied to mathematics, has found a pedagog- 
ical form ‘‘ ready to its hand in the established form of mathematical teaching,” 
and so is now taught in fairly satisfactory courses of study. 
(5) Courses in agriculture are in a present ‘‘ practically inextricable” ‘‘ confu- 
sion,” because ‘‘ with such material for teaching as.is now available there is no 
perspective possible in teaching agriculture;’ * * * ‘and where no other 
science is involved there is nothing of that orderly sequence in the progress of 
instruction which has made the classical education, and to some degree the sci- 
entitic education, a process commanding respect.” 
These latter statements are mostly quotations from the address under discus- 
sion, and are those to which I shall chiefly confine my attention. 
Dr. Murkland’s strictures on the courses of agriculture that now exist are based 
in part on two assumptions: 
(1) That agriculture is, or is susceptible of becoming, an independent science, 
so that in classifying it for teaching purposes we may properly speak of ‘ other 
sciences.” 
(2) That the sciences, such as the chemical and biological, which we now recog- 
nize as somewhat ‘precisely formulated,” are not a proper and essential part of a 
course in agriculture, and therefore chemistry, physics, and biology do not, and 
may not, properly lend their pedagogical form to teaching engineering. 
For myself, I can not accept these assumptions. Agriculture is an art, and the 
act of Congress of 1862 directed us to ‘‘teach the sciences related” thereto. To 
be sure, we may speak of theories of scientific agriculture as a science, but in 
order to teach these theories as theories are taught in engineering courses we must 
give instruction not merely in ‘‘ elementary chemistry” but in advanced chemis- 
try—the chemistry of the plant and the animal, than which none is more pro- 
found; and what is true of chemistry is true of other sciences in their relation to 
the agricultural course. No student can be made properly to understand the 
facts of horticulture, of plant feeding, or of animal nutrition until he is thor- 
oughly grounded in the botanical, chemical, and physiological facts and princi- 
ples underlying these subjects; and so, instead of teaching one science, we must 
teach several. 
I do not see how it will ever be possible to so coordinate into a single science, 
for teaching purposes even, the mutual relations of physics, chemistry, biology, 
and physiology to the art of agriculture, so that it will not be necessary to teach 
the individual sciences, unless the course in agriculture is made post-graduate. 
What, then, does the four-years course in agriculture become? Simply the teach- 
ing of a collection of sciences along those lines which lead up to and involve a 
discussion of their application to the art of agriculture. When, therefore, chem- 
istry, physics, botany, and physiology are taught in this relation, they do not lose 
their identity, but retain the same logical order which they have when taught as 
pure sciences, and they lend to the course in agriculture the teaching form which 
is considered so desirable. 
As a matter of fact, four-years courses of agriculture, as now offered by some 
colleges, at least, are really specialized courses in the sciences, differing from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  ordinary scientific course by pointing out the applications of the sciences to an 
art. Are such courses a mistake? Are they framed in accordance with false 
views? I believe not, and this is the reason for my belief: The real and important 
need of which the farmer is conscious is for a knowledge of conditions and not for 
methods or for skill in manipulation. When he clearly understands the reasons 
for that which goes on about him, the right method will appear. The difficulties 
lie with explanations, not with mechanical processes. And besides, agriculture 
is not a business involving such delicate and intricate mechanical operations that 
attendance upon a college would be justified in order to learn them, although the 
modern dairy, the forcing house, and the fruit garden do require skill. But I 
venture to assert that no machines or practical methods have yet become ayaila- 
ble to the agriculturist whose use the clear-brained inmates of our farm homes 
have failed to master. The spraying of fruit with fungicides and insecticides 
illustrates how readily the necessary manipulation was acquired when the reasons 
for these operations became evident. It is the explanation of phenomena, then, 
which the extended course of study should give in order that the farmer may know 
how to adapt himself to the varying and complex conditions which he meets in 
his work. 
The same educator whose utterances I have called in question has made other 
statements in his address which should not pass unnoticed. He declares that 
“arranging different courses of study in a general agricultural course is as nearly 
haphazard a process as anything can be in matters of instruction,” and that ‘cer- 
tain text-books may be assigned to the senior year in one of these colleges with 
absolutely no reason why they should not haye been assigned to the freshman 
year or, for that matter, to some year of the preparatory school course.” 
It would have been gratifying if President Murkland had illustrated this state- 
ment by specifying particular studies which are so devoid of relation to other sub- 
jects that their place in a course of study is in no way indicated, for then his 
meaning would be more clear. Did he have in mind the subject of tillage, which, 
unless considered in the light of the underlying principles of chemistry and physics, 
would be taught in a manner unworthy an extended course of instruction? Did 
he refer to the teaching of horticulture, which, to be intelligently and systemat- 
ically done, must be based upon a previously acquired knowledge of botany? Did 
he mean the subject of plant nutrition, in which the instruction is always halting 
and unsatisfactory if the student knows nochemistry? Or animal nutrition, tothe 
proper consideration of which must be brought more than a smattering of chem- 
ical and physiological information. I believe I am fairly familiar with the list of 
subjects that could properly be placed in a four-years course in agriculture, and 
I know of no one which does not seem to have its position as closely indicated 
as is the case with many mathematical and language subjects, and with some 
subjects the logical order is almost imperatively fixed. 
The statements and conclusions lead to a wide range of questions which we 
can not discuss here. I will briefly notice one, however. Have the schools of 
lower grade and the short course in agriculture, such as the “‘ dairy course,” no 
justification? 
They are abundantly justified both by what the four-years course has failed, and 
always will fail, to accomplish, and by the actual results which have followed their 
introduction. They are reaching young men who otherwise might never have had 
their thought stimulated to greater activity or their eyes fitted for larger vision. 
They are notideal. They are nota full substitute for the four-years course, but 
Iam of the opinion that as a means of carrying to the mass of farmers a higher 
appreciation of exact knowledge they are likely to constitute the most efficient 
school effort that we arenow attempting. Ido most emphatically protest, though, 
against these briefer courses being regarded as an acknowledgment that the higher
-P-A-G-E-535
CURRICULUM OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 455 
  and fuller course lacks form and efficiency. The logic of such reasoning is not 
clear, and scarcely requires comment. 
Passing now from that phase of our subject which relates chiefly to the college 
professor and the investigator, let us consider the need of conservatism in the 
interpretation to the farming public of its relation to scientific facts and theories. 
In this particular field of work, aside from the station bulletins, we have to do 
chiefly with the institute speaker and the editor. 
In order that the farmer may be instructed and helped, and not confused, these 
two popular teachers should display a conservatism that is born of sound and 
adequate knowledge. 
Institute speakers as we now find them include men of a great variety of experi- 
ence. To-day we listen to the man of science and to-morrow to the man of prac- 
tice, both of whom have their peculiar place and value. It is extremely desirable, 
however, that the one shall not attempt to occupy the province of the other. 
While there is an occasional scientist who is familiar with the methods of prac- 
tice, and a few who till the soil that have a fairly wide range of scientific knowl- 
edge, the rule is that the one falls far short of expertness in the domain of the 
other. It is better that the specialist in some line of agricultural practice shall 
not feel called upon to furnish a scientific explanation of all that he does, and that 
the speaker who is expert mostly in some departments of science shall not give too 
much free advice in regard to the details of farm work. Such a regard for the 
proprieties will tend to the establishment of greater confidence on the part of the 
public in those who appear in the capacity of teachers. 
It is to be feared, moreover, that there is a tendency to gauge the value and effi- 
ciency of an institute speaker chiefiy by his ability to amuse an audience, rather 
than by his credentials for sound and accurate knowledge. This is partly due to 
the fact that many audiences of farmers are better satisfied with amusement than 
with an address which requires close and earnest attention. It is certain, how- 
ever, that just as we now confess the disaster due to the incapacity of religious 
teachers whose only claim to confidence is a sanctified ignorance, so we can be 
sure that glibness of tongue is not all the qualification which teachers in agricul- 
ture should possess. 
An error may be as effectually presented from the platform as a truth, but it is 
of vast importance to the hearer whether it be error or truth. A truth expressed 
in homely phrase is at least harmless and may be beneficial, but an error attract- 
ively uttered is always dangerous and may workinjury. Itis not an exaggeration 
to declare that some very grotesque science has been proclaimed at farm institutes 
by men who were out of their proper spheres of discussion, and who therefore 
lacked the exact knowledge necessary to accurate and reliable statements of a sci- 
entific character. This evil it is within the power of those who officially conduct 
public agricultural discussions to greatly remedy. 
We will now consider somewhat briefly the relation of the press to scientific 
agriculture. What the agricultural editor most sorely needs is not only a conserv- 
ative mind, but the ability to discriminate between the true and the false—an 
ability which does not proceed from a ready and attractive style of writing or from 
what we in general term the art of journalism, but from a fund of information. 
The number of agricultural papers, and papers which have an agricultural page, 
that are offered to the reading public, is legion. To some of these the farmer is 
greatly indebted. They are conducted by competent men, who summarize for the 
readers the best knowledge and thought that are current. Some of them, how- 
ever, present an aggregation of fact and theory which is without form or comeli- 
ness when viewed in the light of truth, * * * There is a great opportunity, 
though perhaps not yet a great demand, for men especially trained to be editors 
of agricultural newspapers. These should be men who possess the fundamentals
-P-A-G-E-536
456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of science and practice, and while they may not be experts in any one direction, 
they should be so well acquainted with the sources of knowledge and with the 
status of men and things that they can sift the chaff from the wheat. 
This is not a plea for an aristocracy of knowledge based upon an orthodox train- 
ing in school or out of school, or upona required assent to the recognized credo of 
science or practice. It is not to be expected that even men of acknowledged 
authority shall all bring their views to the same dead level, but it would be a 
relief if we could eliminate from public discussion those speakers and writers 
whose chief claim to a hearing is that they disagree with the accepted verdicts of 
science and practice, not because they have had the opportunity exhaustively to 
examine the foundations upon which these conclusions rest, but rather because, 
after a superficial observation of the surface of things, they are not able to reach 
the same conclusions. The theories which these pseudo-scientists weave out of 
the tissues of their own brains, though generally short-lived, may not only mis- 
lead, but do great harm by destroying confidence in the science that is worthy of 
the name. 
It may be somewhat superfluous to suggest that there is need for conservatism 
on the part of the farmer, for he has been repeatedly pointed out as an example of 
excessive caution in the adoption of new ideas. Certainly he has sometimes 
assumed an attitude of even extreme reserve toward things scientific, and although 
the best farm practice furnishes abundant evidence that the discoveries of science 
have taken a firm hold upon the means and methods of agriculture, yet he is dis- 
posed carefully to question any new theories or change of practice that is pre- 
sented to his attention. Such conservatism is wise. The farmer is receiving a 
great deal of free advice from a variety of sources, which, as we have tried to 
show, is not always reliable, and until by inexpensive experiments, or by less 
expensive observation, he secures reasonable proof of the value of a new method 
or appliance, he does well to adhere to his old and tried ways. 
The peculiar characteristic pertaining to the farmer’s conservative habit is that 
it occasionally suffers unfortunate and costly lapses. The owner of generous 
acres will often resist the teachings of science and experience, and will sneer at 
the advice of the ablest men in his own calling, only to grasp at the glib promises 
of the man he never before saw and of whose trustworthiness he knows absolutely 
nothing. 
We find in farm homes, as we find everywhere, a strange expectancy concerning 
things new and untried. Humanity has always been hoping that out of the land 
of magic would come the relief from the burdens of life, or the promise and ful- 
fillment of great rewards from little effort. The fraudulent food and fertilizer, 
the patent medicine, and the wonderful business opportunity which offers a chance 
to get something out of nothing, all exist because of this unconfessed faith in the 
extraordinary value of the unknown. It is this credulity concerning things out- 
side the farmer’s ordinary experience that renders it so difficult to defeat the 
schemes which only defraud. * * * 
No one is infallible, no scientist has attained more than a very incomplete 
knowledge, and mistakes are a common experience, but we confidently assert that 
the highest realizations in agricultuae lie in the conservative yet broadening influ- 
ence of the scientific effort that is now being exerted in its behalf.

  CHAPTER XI. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO FRESHMAN CLASS 
IN COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, AND SCHOOLS OF TECH- 
NOLOGY. 
The requirements for admission to undergraduate courses of institutions for 
higher education in the United States are almost as varied as the number of such 
institutions. This diversity of requirements is a great burden to the preparatory 
schools of the country, as it necessitates the formation of a much larger number of 
classes than would be the case if uniform entrance requirements were adopted by 
at least the leading universities and colleges. A movement in this direction has 
been going forward for some years, and has been taken up by a number of college 
and other educational associations. Among the bodies throughout the country 
that are now engaged on this problem are the following:! ‘‘New England Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Preparatory Schools; Massachusetts Classical and High 
School Teachers’ Association; Commission of Colleges in New England on Admis- 
sion Examinations; Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle 
States and Maryland; Schoolmasters’ Association of New York and vicinity; 
University and High School Conference of Colorado State Teachers’ Association; 
Southern College Association; Tennessee Association of Colleges and Schools; 
High School Section, Ohio State Teachers’ Association; College and Normal Sec- 
tion of North Dakota Educational Association; Nebraska Association of Superin- 
tendents and Principals; College Section of State Teachers’ Association of 
Nebraska; Department of Colleges and High Schools, South Dakota Educational 
Association; Committee of Ten of South Dakota Educational Association on Col- 
lege Requirements; Southern Educational Association; Committee appointed by 
Southern Educational Association to consider relations of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools; Committee on High School Course, Nevada; Louisiana Association of 
Latin Teachers; North Central States Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools; Michigan Schoolmasters’ Club; Committee of University Presidents to 
unify requirements; Department of Higher Education of the Montana State 
Teachers’ Association; National Educational Association.” 
From the foregoing list it will be seen that there seems to be a general move- 
ment throughout the country in favor of uniform entrance requirements. Some 
tangible results have already been reached, especially noteworthy being the fact 
that the English requirements adopted by the Commission of Colleges in New 
England on Admission Examinations and the College Association of the Middle 
States and Maryland are now required for admission by 87 of the institutions of 
the country, from Maine to Oregon and from Minnesota to Missouri, 26 different 
States being represented. 
The Commission of Colleges in New England on Admission Examinations was 
formed in 1886 in response to an appeal made by the New England Association of 
1 Education, May, 1897. 
457
-P-A-G-E-538
458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Colleges and Preparatory Schools for the purpose of maintaining and promoting 
uniformity in the requirements for admission. The commission as at present con- 
stituted has fifteen members, as follows: Amherst College, Amherst, Mass.; Boston 
University, Boston, Mass.; Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me.; Brown University, 
Providence, R. I.; Colby University, Waterville, Me.; Dartmouth College, Han- 
over, N. H.; Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.; Middlebury College, Middle- 
bury, Vt.; Smith College, Northampton, Mass.; Trinity College, Hartford, Conn.; 
Tufts’ College, Massachusetts; Wellesley College, Wellesley, Mass.; Wesleyan 
University, Middletown Conn.; Williams College, Williamstown, Mass.; Yale 
University, New Haven, Conn. 
The actions and recommendations of the commission are not binding upon the 
several members thereof, but ‘full liberty of action is reserved to each faculty on 
all proposals made by the commission.” One of the first matters to receive the 
attention of the commission was the requirement in English, and nearly all of the 
annual reports of the commission contain some action taken on this subject, which 
it is not necessary to repeat here. The admission requirements in English, as 
agreed upon by representatives of and adopted by the Commission of Colleges in 
New England on Admission Examinations, the Association of Colleges and Pre- 
paratory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, and the New England Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, are as follows: 
ENGLISH. 
I,.—READING AND PRACTICE. 
  A limited number of books are assigned for reading. The candidate is required 
to present evidence of a general knowledge of the subject-matter of these books, 
and to answer simple questions on the lives of their authors. The form of exami- 
nation will usually be the writing of a paragraph or two on each of several topics 
to be chosen by the candidate from a considerable number—perhaps ten or fifteen— 
set before him in the examination paper. The treatment of these topics is designed 
to test the candidate’s power of clear and accurate expression, and calls for only a 
general knowledge of the substance of the books. In place of a part or the whole 
of this test the candidate may present an exercise book, properly certified to by 
his instructor, containing compositions or other written work done in connection 
with the reading of the books. 
. The books set for this part of the examination will be:

COLLEGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 459 
Il.—STUDY AND PRACTICE, 
A smaller number of books are assigned for more careful study. The examina- 
tion upon these books covers subject-matter, form, and structure, and also tests 
the candidate’s ability to express his knowledge with clearness and accuracy. 
The books set for this part of the examination will be: 
1897.—Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice; Burke’s Speech on Conciliation with 
America; Scott’s Marmion; Macaulay’s Life of Samuel Johnson.

Speech on Conciliation with America; Carlyle’s Essay on Burns. 
1900.—Shakespeare’s Macbeth; Milton’s Paradise Lost, Books I and II; Burke’s 
Speech on Conciliation with America; Macaulay’s Essays on Milton and Addison. 
Norr.—No candidate will be accepted in English whose work is notably defect- 
ive in point of spelling, punctuation, idiom, or division into paragraphs, 
In addition to the English requirements, the commission has for several years 
been at work on the requirements in Latin, Greek, and the modern languages. 
The requirements in Latin and Greek, as approved by the commission in 1895 and 
transmitted to the several colleges for their adoption, are as follows:! 
Latin. 
I,— ELEMENTARY, 
The elementary examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who 
have studied Latin in a systematic course of five lessons a week, extending through 
at least three school years. It will consist of two parts (which can not be taken 
separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of simple Latin prose and verse. 
(b) A thorough examination on a prescribed portion of Cicero’s speeches (about 
80 pages, Teubner text), directed to testing the candidate’s mastery of the ordinary 
forms, constructions, and idioms of the language; the test to consist, in part, of 
writing simple Latin prose involving the use of such words, constructions, and 
idioms only as occur in the speeches prescribed. 
Il,—ADVANCED. 
The advanced examinations will be adapted to the proficiency of those who have 
studied Latin in a systematic course of five lessons a week, extending through at 
least four school years. The two examinations may be taken separately: 
(1) The translation at sight of passages of Latin prose and verse, with questions 
on ordinary forms, constructions, and idioms, and on prosody. 
(2) The translation into Latin prose of a passage of connected English narrative. 
The passage set for translation will be based on some portion of the Latin prose 
works usually read in preparation for college, and will be limited to the subject- 
matter of those works. 
GREEK. 
I,—ELEMENTARY. 
The elementary examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who, in 
addition to the course defined as suitable preparation for the elementary examina- 
tion in Latin, have studied Greek in a systematic course of five exercises a week,

  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
extending through at least two school years, It will consist of two parts (which, 
however, can not be taken separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of passages of simple Attic prose. 
(b) A thorough examination on a prescribed portion of Xenophon (about 30 
pages, Teubner text), directed to testing the candidate’s mastery of the ordinary 
forms, constructions, and idioms of the language, the test to consist, in part, of 
writing simple Attic prose, involving the use of such words, constructions, and 
idioms only as occur in the portion of Xenophon prescribed. 
Il.—ADVANCED. 
The advanced examinations will be adapted to the proficiency of those who, in 
addition to the course defined as a suitable preparation for the advanced examina- 
tions in Latin, have studied Greek in a systematic course of five exercises a week, 
extending through at least three school years. The two examinations may be 
taken separately: 
(1) The translation at sight of passages of Attic prose and of Homer, with ques- 
tions on ordinary forms, constructions, and idoms, and on prosody. 
(2) The translation into Attic prose of a passage of connected English narrative, 
The passage set for translation will be based on some portion of the Greek prose 
works usually read in preparation for college, and will be limited to the subject- 
matter of those works. 
The portions of Cicero and Xenophon prescribed for the elementary examina- 
tions will be changed from time to time, notice of change being given at least two 
years in advance. 
The committee by whom the requirements in Latin and Greek were prepared 
also reported to the commission proposed courses of study showing how the work 
required above could be done. The courses as finally approved by the commis- 
sion at its tenth annual meeting, in April, 1896, are as follows: 
PROPOSED PREPARATORY COURSES. 
LATIN. 
First year, five lessons a week. First and second terms: Introductory lessons. 
Third term: Easy reading, such as Fables, Viri Rome, Eutropius, etc. (15 to 25 
pages'); practice in reading at sight? and in writing Latin; systematic study of 
grammar begun. 
Second year, five lessons a week. First term: Easy reading continued (15 to 25 
pages); Nepos or Cesar (15 to 20 pages*). Second term: Cesar (30 to 40 pages‘). 
Third term: Ovid’s Metamorphoses (750 to 1,000 lines). Practice in reading at 
sight and in writing Latin, with systematic study of grammar throughout the 
year. 
Third year, five lessons a week. First term: Virgil’s Aineid (750 to 1,000 lines®); 
Cicero, in Cat. I and II (23 pages). Practice in reading at sight and in writing 
Latin. Grammar. Second and third terms: Cicero, in Cat. III and IV (224 pages). 
Cesar (45 to 60 pages) and Ovid (500 to 750 lines), mainly for practice in reading 
at sight. Thorough grammatical review and practice in writing Latin, both 
based on study of Cicero, in Cat. II-IV. 
  
1 Teubner pages are the standard. 
2“Reading at sight” is used in these programmes as a convenient phrase to denote the read- 
ing of Latin or Greek with understanding of the sense, independently of or preliminary to the 
formal rendering into idiomatic English; and by ‘practice in reading at sight” is meant not 
merely the translation of unprepared passages in class, but the inculcation of correct methods 
of reading to be used by the pupil in preparing assigned passages as well. 
3E. g., B. G. II (174 pages). 
4E. g., B. G. (333 pages) or III and IV (34 pages). 
* Book I contains 756 lines.
-P-A-G-E-541
COLLEGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 461 
Fourth year, five lessons a week. Cicero (45! to 60 pages). Virgil (4,000° to 
6,000 lines). Practice in reading at sight and in writing Latin. Grammar. 
If the advanced examination in Latin composition is not required, the course 
may be reduced by one lesson a week in the third and fourth years. 
GREEK. 
  First year, five lessons a week. First and second terms: Introductory lessons. 
Third term: Xenophon’s Anabasis (20 to 50 pages). Practice in reading at sight 
and in writing Greek. Systematic study of grammar begun. 
Second year, five lessons a week. Xenophon’s Anabasis (continued), either alone 
or with other Attic prose (85 to 120 pages). Practice in reading at sight. System- 
atic study of grammar. Thorough grammatical review and practice in writing 
Greek, both based on study of Book II of the Anabasis. 
Third year, five lessons a week. Homer (2,500 to 5,0004 lines). Attic prose, 
with practice in writing Greek (25 to 40 pages®). Grammar. Practice in reading 
at sight. 5 
If the advanced examination in Greek composition is not required, the course 
may be reduced by one lesson a week in the last year. 
The commission also voted to recommend : 
(1) That colleges which prescribe an examination in the translation and sub- 
ject-matter of specified portions of Homer and Virgil unite in specifying for such 
examination Iliad, Books I and II, 1-493; Auneid, Books I-V; and that the selec- 
tion of such additional reading in each author, as may be required by any college, 
be left to the discretion of the preparatory teacher, the amount only being stated 
by the college. 
(2) That colleges which admit on certificate unite in specifying as required — 
reading Xenophon, Anabasis, I-III; Homer, Iliad, I, II, 1-493; Cesar, B. G. 
I-III; Cicero, the speeches against Cataline and on the Manilian Law; Virgil, 
4ineid, I-V; the selection of such additional reading in each author as may be 
required by any college being left to the discretion of the preparatory teacher, the 
amount only being stated by the college. 
(8) That colleges which confine their tests in the translation of Greek and Latin 
authors to translations at sight base their examinations on the assumption that 
the candidate has read, as part of his preparation, the portions specified in vote (2) 
above, and that they so announce in their catalogues. 
With respect to the admission requirements in modern languages, the commis- 
sion seems to have some difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory decision. At the 
tenth annual meeting the following scheme of revised requirements was presented 
to the commission by the committee to whom the subject had been referred: 
GERMAN. 
I,— ELEMENTARY, 
The elementary examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who have 
studied German in a systematic course of five periods a week for one year. It will 
consist of two parts (which, however, can not be taken separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of a passage of easy prose containing no rare words. 
The passage set for translation will be suited to candidates who have read not 
less than 150 duodecimo pages of simple German, chiefly narrative prose; this 
1B. g., pro Archia, de lege Manilia, and pro Marcello (46 pages). 
* Books II-VI of the Aneid contain 3,999 lines. 
8K. g., Iliad LIV (omitting II, 494-end) and VI. 
4B. g., Iliad I-III (omitting II, 494-end) and VI-VIIL. 
° Making a total of 180 to 190 pages of Attic prose, equivalent to four to six books of the Anabasis,
-P-A-G-E-542
462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
amount includes sight reading done in class. It is important that all translation 
be done into clear and idiomatic English. 
(b) The translation into German of simple English sentences, to test the candi- 
date’s familiarity with elementary grammar. 
Elementary grammar is understood to include the conjugation of the weak and 
the more usual strong verbs; the declension of articles, adjectives, pronouns, and 
such nouns as are readily classified; the commoner prepositions; the simpler uses 
of modal auxiliaries; the elements of syntaxand word order. Proficiency may also 
be tested by direct questioning, 
Practice in pronunciation by reading aloud as much as possible from the texts 
used in the class is recommended; also the writing of German from dictation. 
Il.—ADVANCED. 
The advanced examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who have 
studied German in a systematic course of at least four periods a week for three 
years. It will consist of two parts (which may be taken separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of ordinary German. 
In preparation for this examination candidates will be expected to have read, in 
addition to the amount specified under ‘‘Elementary (a),” at least 600 duodecimo 
pages of classical and contemporary prose and verse, to be selected from such works 
as the following: Riehl, Kulturgeschichtliche Novellen; Freytag, Bilder aus der 
deutschen Vergangenheit, especially Aus dem Mittelalter and Aus dem Jahrhun- 
dert des grossen Krieges; Kohlrausch, Das Jahr 1813; Schiller, Der dreissigjahrige 
Krieg, Wilhelm Tell, Maria Stuart, Die Jungfrau von Orleans; Goethe, Hermann 
und Dorothea, Egmont, Iphigénie; Lessing, Minna von Barnhelm. At least one- 
half of the amount read should be nineteenth century prose. 
(b) Tho translation into German of a passage of easy English prose. 
In preparation for this examination candidates will be expected to have acquired 
a thorough knowledge of accidence, the elements of word formation, and the prin- 
cipal uses of prepositions and conjunctions; the essentials of syntax, especially the 
uses of modal auxiliaries and the subjunctive and infinitive modes. Proficiency 
may also be tested by direct questioning. 
It is recommended that the candidate acquire the ability to follow a recitation 
conducted in German and to answer in that language questions asked by the 
instructor. 
FRENCH. 
I,—ELEMENTARY. 
The clementary examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who 
have studied French in a systematic course of five periods a week for one year. It 
will consist of two parts (which, however, can not be taken separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of ordinary prose. 
The passages set for translation will be suited to candidates who have read not 
less than 200 duodecimo pages from the works of at least three different authors. 
This amount includes sight reading done in class. Not more than half the read- 
ing should be from works of fiction. It is important that all translation be done 
into clear and idiomatic English. 
(0) The translation into French of English sentences, or a short connected pas- 
sage, to test the candidate's familiarity with elementary grammar. 
Elementary grammar is understood to include the conjugation of regular and 
the more usual irregular verbs, such as aller, tenir, pouvoir, savoir, voir, vouloir, 
dire, faire, and those belonging to the classes represented by dormir, ouvrir, con- 
naitre, conduire, craindre; the forms and positions of the personal pronouns; the 
uses of other pronouns and of possessive, demonstrative, and interrogative adjec- 
tives; the inflection of nouns and adjectives for gender and number, except rare
-P-A-G-E-543

  cases; the commoner uses of the article, and the partitive constructions. Pro- 
ficiency may also be tested by direct questioning. 
Pronunciation should be carefully taught and the pupil should be accustomed to 
hear and understand the spoken language. The writing of French from dictation 
is also recommended. 
II.— ADVANCED. 
The advanced examination will be adapted to the proficiency of those who have 
studied French in a systematic course of at least four periods a week for three 
years. It will consist of two parts (which may be taken separately): 
(a) The translation at sight of standard French. 
The passage set for translation will be suited to candidates who have read, in 
addition to the amount specified under ‘‘ Elementary (a),” not less than 800 duo- 
decimo pages of classical and contemporary prose and verse from the writings of 
at least five standard authors. 
(b) The translation into French of English prose. 
In preparation for this examination candidates will be expected to have acquired 
a thorough knowledge of accidence and a familiarity with the essentials of French 
syntax, especially the uses of modes and tenses, and also with the commoner 
idiomatic phrases. Proficiency may also be tested by direct questioning. 
Careful attention should be paid to pronunciation and to the use of spoken 
French, that the candidate may at least acquire the ability to follow a recitation 
conducted in the language and to answer questions asked by the instructor. 
The above requirements, while they received the general approval of the com- 
mission, do not seem to be entirely satisfactory, as is evidenced by the following 
extract from the report of the commission: 
«After the committee had retired, the commission voted to accept the report and 
discussed the proposed requirements at length and very carefully, all the members 
participating in the discussion. It was clear that the problem of devising satis- 
factory requirements in French and in German was not altogether simple. The 
lack of parallelism, at certain points, between the requirements in French and 
those in German was noted; questions were raised as to the relation of the adyanced 
requirements to the elementary in respect of the time allotted to each. It was 
observed that if a modern language is to become a substitute for Greek, four 
periods a week for three years in that language are not equivalent to five periods 
a week for three years in Greek, the amount presupposed in the new requirements 
in Greek. Finally, the commission unanimously voted: 
«“«That the proposed requirements in German and French be transmitted to the 
colleges with the general approval of the commission. 
“That the executive committee be instructed to invite from the modern lan- 
guage departments of the several colleges their opinions on the following details 
of the plan: 
“1, The amount and character of the reading expected of candidates. 
‘©2, The expediency of specifying authors in the advanced requirements; and 
that the executive committee be then empowered to take such further action in 
the premises as they deem expedient.” 
While other subjects have been called to the attention of the commission and 
have been discussed, no definite action has been taken thereon. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS IN THE MIDDLE STATES 
AND MARYLAND, 
The Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and 
Maryland owes its existence largely to the efforts of ex-President Edward H. 
Magill, of Swarthmore College, which resulted in the formation, in 1887, of the 
College Association of Pennsylvania. The objects of the association, as stated in 
the constitution, are ‘‘ to consider the qualifications for candidates for admission 
   
-P-A-G-E-544
464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
to the colleges and the methods of admission; the character of the preparatory 
schools, the courses of study to be pursued in the colleges, including their order, 
number, etc.; the relative number of required and elective studies in the various 
classes; the kind and character of degrees conferred; methods of college organiza- 
tion, government, etc.; the relation of the colleges to the State and to the general 
educational systems of the State and country; and any and all other questions 
affecting the welfare of the colleges or calculated to secure their proper advance- 
ment.” : ~- - : 
When it was first organized only colleges in Pennsylvania were eligible, but in 
1888 the name was changed to the College Association of the Middle States and 
Maryland, and the constitution was changed so as to make el 
any college in the States included in its name. Again, in 1892, the constitution 
and by-laws werechanged so as to make eligible for membership all universities, col- 
leges, normal and high schools, and other schools which prepare students for college 
within the bounds of the Middle States and Maryland. In 1896 there were enrolled 
as members of the association 51 colleges and universities and 86 secondary schools, 
An examination of the proceedings of the association discloses the fact that while 
numerous educational subjects have been discussed, no action has been taken on 
the subject of admission requirements, with the exception of the requirements in 
English, as noted on a preceding page. 
NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
Tho North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools was organized 
at Evanston, Ill., March 29, 1895, for the purpose of establishing ‘‘ closer relations 
between the colleges and the secondary schools of the North Central States.” The 
constitutian of the association provides that ‘‘all decisions of the association bear- 
ing upon the policy and the management of higher and of secondary institutions 
are understood to be advisory in their character.” This association has also recom- 
mended to its members the adoption of the English requirements, given on pages 
458-459, and has now under consideration the subject of entrance requirements in 
history. 
  ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
The Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States 
was organized at Atlanta, Ga.,on November 6, 1895. The constitution as adopted 
provides that ‘‘ the object of this association shall be to consider the qualification 
of candidates for admission to colleges, the methods of admission, the character 
of the preparatory schools, the course of study to be pursued in the colleges and 
schools, including their order, number, etc.,as well as such other subjects as tend 
to the promotion of interests common to colleges and preparatory schools.” 
The by-laws of the association are as follows: 
1. No college shall be eligible to membership in this association which furnishes 
preparatory instruction in any subject as part of its college organization. 
2. No college shall be admitted to or retain membership in this association which 
does not hold written entrance examinations for admission of at least the scope 
indicated in section 3 below, and publish the same annually, depositing copies of 
said examination papers with the secretary of this association. 
8. The association prescribes the following as minimum requirements! for 
admission to college, the same to be binding on each institution belonging to this 
association. 
In English: Requirements of the Association of Schools and Colleges in the 
" Middle States and Maryland: 
In history and geography: United States history and general geography. 
  
1The requirements outlined in the by-laws are all to take effect with the fall term of 1897, 
except the requirements in Greek, which become operative with the fall term of 1898.
-P-A-G-E-545
COLLEGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 465 
In mathematics: Arithmetic and algebra through quadratics, or algebra to 
quadratics and three books of plane geometry. 
In Latin: Four books of Cesar and four orations of Cicero (or their equivalent) 
with accompanying work in grammar and prose composition. 
In Greek: Three books of Xenophon’s Anabasis (or equivalent), with accompany- 
ing work in grammar and simple prose composition (operative in 1898). 
Of the above subjects, examinations in history, geography, and English shall be 
required of all students admitted to college, provided that students pursuing 
technical studies in not more than two subjects may be excused from these exam- 
inations. Examinations in Latin, Greek, and mathematics, respectively, shall be 
required of all students expecting to continue these subjects. Certificates cover- 
ing the above requirements may be accepted from duly accredited preparatory 
schools in lieu of entrance examinations at the colleges. 
4. No college that admits students under 15 years of age shall be eligible to 
membership in this association. 
5. No preparatory school that confers degrees shall be eligible to membership 
in this association. 
The association has at present committees at work to see whether any changes 
should be made in the minimum ee for admission to college as given in 
the by-laws, the said committees to report at the annual meeting in 1897. 
SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION, 
At the Buffalo meeting, in August, 1896, the Society for the Promotion of Engi- 
neering Education received a report from the committee on entrance requirements 
of engineering colleges, which had been appointed to investigate that subject. 
The number of institutions included in the investigation was 110, andghhe require- 
znents for admission are tabulated in summarized forms, the requirements of indi- 
vidual institutions not being given. The conclusions arrived at by the committee 
are stated in the report in the following language: 
“Tt is difficult to generalize to the extent of laying down absolute requirements 
to which all colleges should conform; yet, broadly speaking, there exist to-day two 
grades of engineering colleges, whose work lies about one year apart. For the 
first of these the minimum requirements should include the following subjects: 
Algebra, advanced. | Two years of foreign language. 
Plane and solid geometry. American history and some additional 
Physics with laboratory work. history. 
Chemistry with laboratory work. Free-hand drawing. 
New England requirements in English. 
“Kor the second grade the minimum requirements should include: 
Algebra through quadratics. English along the line of New England 
Plane geometry. requirements, but less in amount. 
Physics with laboratory work. American history. 
One year of foreign language. Free-hand drawing. 
  “Below these are colleges, like some of the colleges of agriculture and mechanic 
arts, that are forced by the necessities of environment or the terms of their founda- 
tion to maintain low standards of admission and do in course what other colleges 
throw into requirements. These should insist on requiring as a minimum: 
Arithmetic (complete). English along the line of New England 
Elementary algebra. requirements, but less in amount. 
Plane geometry. American history. 
| ‘ “Any lower requirements than these bring students into college before they 
have completed their courses in the lower schools.”

NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The committees on college entrance requirements appointed by the departments 
of secondary and higher education of the National Educational Association at the 
meeting held at Denver in July, 1895, presented a preliminary report at the Buf- 
falo meeting in 1896, The report which was the result of the first year’s work of 
the committee was printed in full in the June, 1896, number of the School Review, 
and consists of the tabulated requirements in French, German, Greek, history, 
Latin, mathematics, and science for admission to 60 representative institutions of 
the country, with remarks upon the same. 
Mr. J. Remsen Bishop, of the Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio, who 
prepared the remarks on requirements in Greek, ascertained the number of 
institutions requiring specified portions in Greek, and suggested the following as 
a fair compromise which could be accepted as a requirement in Greek by the col- 
leges of the country: 
I. Xenophon and other Greek prose: Xenophon’s Anabasis, four books; or 
Xenophon’s Anabasis, one book, and one hundred pages of Goodwin's Reader; or 
Xenophon’s Anabasis, two books, and Xenophon’s Hellenica, two books; or Xeno- 
phon’s Anabasis, three books, and two orations of Lysias. 
II. Tliad and Odyssey: Three books of the IHiad, omitting catalogue of ships, or 
1,800 lines from liad and Odyssey. 
Ill. Sight translation: Practice in sight reading to the extent of one book of 
Xenophon’s Hellenica and one book of either Hiad or Odyssey. 
IV. Grammar: The essential portions of the Hadley-Allen Greek Grammar, or 
of Goodwin’s Greek Grammar, or of some other standard grammar. 
V. Prosody: The principles of hexameter verse. 
VI. Prose composition: Translation of connected English prose, the vocabulary 
to be limited to that of Xenophon’s Anabasis, Book II, and Xenophon’s Hellenica, 
Book II. 
The discussions on the other subjects consist largely in giving the number of 
institutions requiring specific portions of the several subjects, but do not contain 
suggestions for a uniform requirement. 
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
The report of the State superintendent of public instruction of Pennsylvania for 
1896 contains a report on higher education by the College and University Council 
created by an act of June 26, 1895. Onthe subject of admission requirements the 
report says: 
“The standard of admission into the freshman class, established by the council 
as a minimum requirement for all institutions which may hereafter apply for the 
right to confer liberal or technical degrees, is given in the following report, which 
was received and adopted at the session of the council held on October 6, 1896. 
«The council adopts thefollowing entrance requirements, of which those relating 
to English, history, and mathematics are prescribed, and of the other language 
requirements two must be chosen, except that technical schools may require addi- 
tional preparation in mathematics and physics as a fair equivalent for one lan- 
guage requirement.

PRESENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 
The great amount of attention that is being devoted to the subject of admission 
requirements to college by numerous organizations has led this Office to collect 
and compile in tabulated form, convenient for comparison, the requirements for 
admission to the various courses of 475 universities and colleges, with the hope 
that such compilation may be of some assistance in the study of ghe subject. 
The information has been derived exclusively from the annual catalogues! of the 
several institutions, and in a large number of cases is not as definite as might be 
wished. One of the greatest obstacles in the collection of these data is due to the 
fact that a large number of the institutions maintain preparatory departments, 
and many'of them do not publish requirements for admission to the freshman 
class beyond stating that the completion of the preparatory course or a course 
similar thereto will admit a candidate to the freshman class. The preparatory 
courses very often are not given in detail, so that it is impossible to tell how 
much of any individual branch of study is completed during the course, and there- 
fore required for admission to college. 
An examination of the table giving the requirements for admission will show 
a great diversity of requirements, some of them being lamentably low. It will be 
seen that in some institutions all that is required for admission to the freshman 
class is a knowledge of what are known as the common-school branches—reading, 
writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography, and history. 
Admission requirements to A. B. course.—Of the 475 institutions included in the 
tabulated statement, 432 give the requirements for admission to the freshman 
class of the A. B. course. Of this number 402 require some preparation in Latin, 
318 in Greek, and 60 in a modern language. In addition to these there are 25 
institutions in which Greek is optional with a modern language, while the num- 
ber of institutions that require Latin, Greek, and a modern language is 43. From 
these figures it will be seen that 22 institutions do not require Latin for admission 
to an A. B. course, 114 require no Greek, and 372 institutions will admit students 
without any knowledge of modern languages. 
Latin.—Considering the Latin requirements in detail, it is found that 374 insti- 
tutions require some preparation in Cesar. Of this number 180 require 4 or more 
books, 27 require 3 books, 19 require 2 books, 8 require Gate to Cesar, and 140 do 
  
1 With but few exceptions, the catalogues for the year 1895-96 were used.  
-P-A-G-E-548
468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  not specify the amount demanded. The number of institutions specifying less 
than 4 books of Cesar is very small, being but 54, or 124 per cent of the total 
number. 
The number of institutions requiring Cicero is 288, or 86 less than the number 
requiring Cesar. Of the total number requiring Cicero, 117 require 6 or more 
orations, 23 require 5 orations, 86 require 4 orations, 8 require 3 orations, 9 require 
2 orations, 3 require 1 oration, 8 require Cicero’s letters, and 84 do not specify the 
amount required. 
Virgil is required by 257 institutions, 136 of which require 6 or more books. Of 
the remainder, 9 institutions require 5 books, 22 require 4 books, 14 require 3 books, 
9 require 2 books, 2 require 1 book, and 65 do not specify the amount required. In 
addition to these requirements, 13 institutions require: the Eclogues, 5 require 
Georgics, and 4 require Bucolics. 
Latin grammar, prose composition, and reading at sight may almost be consid- 
ered as universal requirements, with the exception of a small number of institu- 
tions where the Latin requirements are very meager. 
Greek.—The number of institutions requiring Greek for admission to the A. B. 
course is 318, of which number 286 require some knowledge of the Anabasis, 153 
of the Iliad, and 12 of Herodotus. Of the institutions requiring the Anabasis, 98 
require 4 or more books, 56 require 3 books, 25 require 2 books, 23 require 1 book, 
and in 84 cases the amount required is not specified. Of the institutions requir- 
ing the Iliad, 99 require 3 books, 21 require 2 books, 1 requires 1 book, and 32 do 
not give the amount required. 
Mathematics.—With respect to the requirements in mathematics, it may be seen 
that 346 institutions require an examination in arithmetic. The other 86 institu- 
tions that dg not require an examination undoubtedly suppose that the study of 
arithmetic has been completed before a candidate presents himself for admittance 
to college. The requirements in arithmetic usually include a knowledge of the 
metric system of weights and measures. Algebra is required by 412 institutions, 
leaving but 20 institutions that admit students to an A. B. course without some 
knowledge of algebra. Algebra, through quadratics or beyond, is required by 174 
institutions; to quadratics, is required by 37, and 201 institutions simply state 
that algebra is required. With respect to geometry, it is found that 294 institu- 
tions require plane geometry; 93, solid geometry, and 8, spherical geometry. Two 
institutions require an examination in conic sections, and 4 in trigonometry. 
History.—The requirements in history seem to be more varied than in any other 
branch of study. History of the United States is required by 306 institutions, 
civil government by 129, and State or local history by 9 institutions. General 
history is required by 127 institutions, history of Greece by 112, and history of 
Rome by 116. As a rule the institutions requiring the history of Greece also 
require the history of Rome. History of England is required by 57 institutions, 
and the history of France and of Germany by but 1. 
Admission requirements to B. S. course.—Included in the tabulated statement 
are the requirements for admission to the B. 8. course of 318 institutions. In a 
number of these institutions the B. 8. degree is conferred on students who have 
completed courses of study in engineering, agriculture, etc.—courses in which, as 
arule, no ancient language is required, and naturally none is required for admis- 
sion thereto. It is, therefore, not surprising that while 93 per cent of the insti- 
tutions require Latin for admission to the A. B. course, only 55 per cent require 
Latin for admission to the B. S. course, and only 7 institutions require Greek for 
admission to such course. The number of institutions requiring a modern lan- 
guage is 123, and a number allow an option between ancient and modern languages, 
While it is generally conceded that the requirements to the B. S. course are some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-549
  
  COLLEGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 469 
what less than those to the A. B. course, there seems to be a tendency to raise the 
B. S. requirements until they shall be equal to the A. B. requirements. 
In an article on ‘‘ The new Harvard entrance requirements,” by Albert Bushnell 
Hart, in the October, 1897, number of the Educational Review, he says: ‘‘For the 
Lawrence Scientific School, where the Greek question plays no part, the faculty 
has already fixed a combination of subjects with large options, and has announced 
that the entrance requirements in that school will gradually be increased till they 
reach about the same level as the college (A. B.) requirements.” Another notice- 
able fact in this connection is that Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., has abolished 
the B. 8., B. L.. and Ph. B. degrees, and will hereafter confer the A. B. degree for 
the completion of all courses of study excepting purely technical and professional 
courses, for which technical degrees will be conferred. 
The summarized statistics, by States and Territories, of the principal require- 
ments for admission to A. B., B. S., B. L., and Ph. B. courses of study are given 
in the following tables, while the detailed requirements for each institution are 
given on the pages immediately following the summaries. The principal object 
in compiling the requirements was to show, for as inany institutions as possible, 
the amount of preparation required by them of candidates for admission without 
giving in detail the manner in which the several branches of study should be mas- 
tered. To give the method of preparation recommended by the several institutions 
would require more space than can be allotted to this subject at the present time.

CHAPTER XII 
THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN.' 
(a) The growth of civilization and the reign of law, marked by the protection of 
children from unnatural parents—The patria potestas of the Roman—The 
interference of the Roman law to protect the orphan from the “ familia”— 
The efforts of the early church to mitigate the right of the father to kill his 
child—The emancipation of the child at 21 among Anglo-Saxon communities 
suggested to have been nourished if not engendered by the feudal system, 
which made the serf or vassal swear fealty to the lord of the manor or district 
who then represented the State, and also to the complete absorption of the 
old religious functions of the pater familias by the new religious father or 
priest. 
(b) The slum districts and their juvenile inhabitants—Their numbers—Nation- 
ality—Illiterate parents—Schooling—Employments—Dwelling places—The 
wages of the parents and the duration of enforced idleness. 
(c) Decisions of the higher courts—-The right of an individual not directly benefited 
to interfere with taxation for school purposes—The indissoluble unity of 
taxation and the illegality of attempts to segregate the body politic in classes 
differentiated by political or other opinion—The meaning of the term com- 
mon or public school as distinguished from the meaning of any term used 
to designate a school which is ‘‘open and free to all,” but not controlled by 
tho State. 
(d) Preliminary tabulation of the sources of income and the origin of the perma- 
nent school funds in the several States. 
It is convenient, when discussing the status of facts which are in 
process of change, to invite a comprehension of the import of this 
charge by attempting to show the true origin of the facts, or by 
assuming as true an origin which is, in reality, merely an historic 
possibility or hypothesis. Such an origin, whether true or assumed, 
is the point of reference which gives vitality to the argument, as the 
base line in surveying gives subsequent utility to the records of the 
survey. 
As the primitive herds of human beings, it may be assumed, emerged 
from the promiseuity of savagery,’ the organization of the family, both

in China and in Europe, appears in a form which in itself, though not 
in its antecedents, is susceptible of some degree of verification. Thus 
a very positive expression as to the total absence of legal rights of 
children is made in the Institutes of Justinian. ‘‘The power we 
Romans haye over our children,” say the compilers of the Insti- 
tutes, ‘‘is peculiar to the citizens of Rome, for the men of no other 
nation have such control over children as we have over ours.”! And 
again: ‘‘Our children who are begotten in lawful marriage are in our 
power” (in potestate nostra). In China, likewise, ‘‘ Every person is 
in strict subjugation tosomebody. The child is subject to his parents 
or guardian. They in turn are subject to their parents, and the 
grandparents may be called to account by the elders of the clan.”” 
The patria potestas, the rule of the father, still exists in China, and 
with it a nation which passes in European literature for an illustra- 
tion of a stable but an unimproving society. On the other hand, the 
patria potestas of the Roman in the hands of the Germanic and Celtic 
races of Europe has undergone and is undergoing fundamental 
changes; for the father, as a priest, owner, and judge is being entirely 
submerged in the conception of the parent as a protector or guardian 
influenced by natural affection and not by mercenary motives. 
Originally, then, during the regal and republican periods of Rome, 
neither age, nor marriage, nor election to the highest public office, nor 
anything except emancipation terminated the power of the Roman 
pater familias over his son or his son’s son, and the daughter passed 
on her wedding day into the power of her husband or his governor as 
though she, too, were achild. But the growing refinements of the age 
which welcomed Christianity in spite of the opposition of the govern- 
ment—the essence of government being conservatism—mitigated the 
terrors of the paternal power of life or death as gauged by the stand- 
ard of the ethics of the twentieth century. The pagan Emperor Dio- 
eletian had forbidden the sale of children by their parents, but the 
first Christian Emperor, Constantine, struck the destroyer of his own 
child with the crime of infanticide. Further than that the law did not 
go, and it was only by the exertion and devotion of a new class of 
persons in the community—a class which had acquired the religious 
functions of the father of the Roman family, that is to say, the priests 
. or religious fathers—that even so much as had been formerly ordained 
by Constantine could be realized. 
What the pagan Roman emperors could not effect, owing to the 
impregnable organization of the Roman family of the regal, repub-

  LEGAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. 617 
lican, and early imperial epochs, was nevertheless put in process of 
change for future civilizations by that rationalizing machine called 
the Roman law. During the times of the so-called kings of Rome, 
when the father died, his children—under the age of 15 if boys, and of 
12 if girls—were placed in the hands of the nearest male relative asa 
matter of personal right. In those early times the state had nothing 
to do with this substitution of the relative for the deceased parent. 
That was a right pertaining to the family (familia) organization, and it 
was the family that interposed between the parties concerned.? Other 
than this interference the ward or, as he was called, the ‘‘ pupil” 
had no recourse against his guardian (tutor), just as formerly he had 
had none against his father.* But extension of business relations, 
warfare, and growing emancipation from the idea of the tribal organ- 
ization probably made the interference of the council of family 
groups related by blood ineffective, and the law—that is, the state 
in its character of preventing injustice—took the matter in hand. 
First, the right of a particular kind of lawsuit, called ‘ actio de 
distrahendis rationibus” (adjustment of accounts), was instituted as 
the form in which the ward might ask for an accounting from his 
guardian, and this was followed by the creation of another special 
action called ‘‘ tutele ” which seems to have been intended to supple- 
ment the suit for misuse of the ward’s money (actio distrahendis 
rationibus) and to make the guardian responsible for letting his 
ward’s property lie idle or otherwise neglecting his duty as tutor or 
guardian. The point is that in Roman law this actio directa tutele 
is separated from the general action or suit which may be made in 
every advanced system of law against trustees of any kind for their 
acts of omission as well as those of commission.* 
Thus the State deliberately and, it may be added hesitatingly, inter- 
fered between the guardian and the ward and, through its judicial 
1As long as the ‘‘primitive” family group held together it was under the 
guidance of the eldest male of the eldest line, and the amount of power possessed 
by this patriarch is shown to us in case of Roman heads of families. But the 
patriarch always tended to become merely a judge who decided causes in accord- 
ance with custom. So, likewise, his position as ruler of the family property 
changed, of which he began to be the steward rather than the owner. Starke,

Mayne, Hindu Law and Usage, and W. E. Hearn, the Aryan Household.

“Roman law,” p. 673. 
°Cf. Sir H. S. Maine’s dictum (Ancient Law, 8d Amer. ed., p. 155): ‘‘The 
guardianship of male orpi.ans was no more designed originally to shield them 
till the arrival of years of discretion than the tutelage of women was intended to 
protect that sex against its own feebleness.” The condition to which the later 
Roman law came is given below in the text, quoting Servius as quoted by Paulus.

officers or the judicial side of its administrative officers, indirectly laid 
the foundation of a far more social conception of parentage than the 
rigor of the pater-familias theory of the old eity state allowed;' for 
this progress being made it was not difficult to apply to the father 
Servius’s definition of guardianship, which may be stated as the power 
given by the civil law to protect a child who, on account of his age, is 
not able to defend himself. (Vis ae potestas in eapite libro ad tuen- 
dum eum, qui propter aetatem sua sponte se defendere nequit, juri 
civili data ac permissa.) 
In speaking of the patria potestas in the foregoing no retrospee- 
tive construction has been placed on the motives which actuated 
the so-called democracies, tyrannies, or respublicas of antiquity to 
leave the supreme power of life and death over offspring in the 
hands of the progenitor. It has been said that it was not the father, 
as a mere breeding animal, who was recognized by the Roman law as 
he in whom the patria potestas found a realization, but the father as 
the politically responsible part of the family. It has also been said 
that the main social idea of the society of Greece and of Rome was 
quite stoical, being a haughty preference for honor (virtus) while we 
moderns prefer comfort (utilitas). But it is doubtful whether either 
of these judgments upon antiquity find confirmation outside the 
classic pages of M. Fustel Coulange’s! La Cité Antique and Plutarch’s 
Lives and the like. The Memorabilia of Xenophon, Cicero’s Letters, 
Horace’s Epistles, and the Meditations of the Emperor Mareus Aure- 
lius certainly impress the reader that he is being made acquainted 
with familiar characters as he turns over the pages of those writers 
who wrote candidly of their contemporaries or themselves, and the 
De Officiis was neither the handbook nor the model of Tiberius, 
Nero, or Sejanus, nor of the society they ruled. 
The second blow to the Roman idea of the complete supremacy of 
1La Cité Antique, by Monsieur Fustel de Coulanges, who has taken an advanced 
position among those who favor the patria potestas theory of the Roman society. 
If we turn to the condition of affairs among the pagan or pre-Muhammadan Ara- 
bians it is learned that, ‘‘Whatever amount of external protection this custom 
(the blood feud) may have afforded, it had no tendency to shield the women and 
children of a family against the male adults; the impulses of natural affection 
were too often unequally matched against the suggestions of avarice, lust, super- 
stition, and false pride; and thus we find among the usages revealed to us through 
their subsequent condemnation the following: The plundering of male orphans by 
their brothers, uncles, or cousins, the general denial of rights of inheritance, if 
not all rights of property, to females, the enforced marriage of female orphans 
to their nearest male relative other than a brother, and of widows to the father, 
son, or brother of the deceased husband, or, as an alternative, their sale to a 
strange suitor, the sale of daughters in marriage, or in families where this had 
come to be thought disgraceful.” (Rudiments of Law in pre-Islamite Arabia, 
by Sir R. K. Wilson in introduction to Anglo-Muhammadan (in India) Law, 
page 9.)
-P-A-G-E-699
  LEGAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. 619 
the father of the family was, in Europe, the loss of his function as the 
priest of the family. The third and most important one was the com- 
plete emancipation of the offspring on its attaining an age fixed by 
the state. Whence the idea of emancipation at the age of 21 came is 
unknown. It is thought to be Germanic in its origin, for the provinces 
of France that retained the Roman (i. e., the written law) preserved 
aremnant of the patria potestas while the provinces having the ‘‘cus- 
toms” of their ancestors, or, as the English race say, common law, 
liberated the child on his becoming of age.!’ In France during the 
Revolution, the patria potestas was abolished after the child had 
become of age; but there is another side to it there, which is the duty 
of the parent to support the child. Even to-day, ‘‘in all but the poor- 
est classes of the French people, marriage is made more difficult by 
inveterate family traditions. These center in a moral principle, 
which, perhaps, never existed in the Anglo-Saxon conscience. This 
tradition is that a parent is bound to protect and provide for his 
offspring through the whole course of his life.”? _ 
Be the matter as it may, there can be no error in turning to England, 
for there we find not only the common law and the feudal tenure 
built upon military service, which was due to a lord by the youth on 
reaching the age of 21, but also the earliest emancipation of the serfs 
or farm persons who cultivated the soil and intimately connected 
therewith the first direct interference with the right of the emanci- 
pated peasant or yeoman to neglect to make his child a decent member 
of society. 
The reign of Henry VIII is memorable for the removal of medieval 
restrictions. During its course some 2,500 religious houses were bru- 
tally but effectually eradicated, and nearly 100,000 dependents thereon 
thrown upon the country; the monopoly of the local conspiracies ‘to 
restrict the buying and selling of the goods” in each little city in which 
the guild merchant or one or more trade guilds dwelt was ruthlessly 
broken up; serfdom, already weak, collapsed under the new system 
of sheep farming, and the country was filled with beggars.* In short,

wise determine as to a minor his agnates are held to appoint a curator to him, who 
is responsible in feudal law to the lord in the minor’s name, and protects him, when 
necessary, until the age of 21 years. The curator must be a vassal of the same 
lord.

  620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
by the confiscation of the monasteries alone, one-third of the wealth 
of England changed hands and the whole country was on a boom. 
Population, towns, commerce, and beggars rapidly increased. 
In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Henry VIII an act was 
passed which required that children between 5 and 13 found begging 
or idle should be bound apprentices to some handicraft. The appren- 
ticeship law was compulsory upon master and servant alike; for the 
reception of an apprentice was not voluntary to the master.! This 
system has been called an education theory, and as such, says Mr. 
Froude, was simple but effective. ‘‘It was based on the single prin- 
ciple that next to the knowledge of a man’s duty to God, and asa 
means toward doing that duty, the first condition of a worthy life was 
the ability to maintain it in independence. Varieties of inapplicable 
knowledge might be good but they were not essential; such knowledge 
might be left to the leisure of after years, or it might be dispensed 
with altogether without vital injury.” 
The children of those who could afford the small entrance fees were 
apprenticed to trades, the rest were apprenticed to agriculture, and 
if children were found growing up idle and their father or friends 
failed to prove that they were able to secure them an ultimate main- 
tenance, the mayors in towns and the magistrates in the country had 
authority to take possession of such children and apprentice them as 
they saw fit, that when they grew up they might not be drawn by 
want or incapacity to dishonest courses.” 
The origin of one part of the Puritan acts of 1642-7 is at once apparent. 
By those acts the selectmen of every town were directed by the legisla- 
ture to do two things, one of which was to suffer no such barbarism as 
illiteracy. This part of the Puritan legislation was religious and orig- 
inal. Buttheselectmen were also instructed to see that all parents and 
masters ‘‘do breed and bring up their children and apprentices in 
some honest, lawful calling, labor, or employment, either in husban- 
dry or some other trade profitable for themselves and the Common- 
wealth, if they will not or can not train them up in learning to fit 
them for higher employment.” The originality of the Puritan laws 
therefore, consists in adding to the compulsory apprenticeship the 
obligation of parents to instruct their children in the fundamental 
branches of an English education in order to prevent, to quote the 
language of one act, ‘“‘the snares of that old deluder, Satan.” It- 
will therefore be necessary to supplement Mr. Froude’s laudation of 
the compulsory apprenticeship law drawn by Henry VIII with the

words of Mr..Webster in his Plymouth Rock oration: ‘‘We [the 
people of New England] ‘regard education at public expense as a 
wise and liberal system of police by which property and life and the 
peace of society are secured and the whole moral atmosphere is 
purified.” 
Yet mere lawmaking will not accomplish results. Each one is very 
willing to have society interfere to protect himself from other people, 
but is impatient of social interference to prevent him from doing 
whatever he likes to others. Formerly the State in England issued 
its commands with astonishing frequency to local bodies to do this or 
that act of petty interference. The whole matter is now reversed. 
“We English,” says Mr. Traill, ‘‘are infinitely more governed though 
less legislated at than our ancestors. It seems proper that the State— 
the government by the people—should not wish to be ridiculous by 
merely commanding the citizen to do certain things, but should see 
that he does it, and our English legislators are continually acting or 
being solicited to act on the assumption that it is their duty to take 
eare of the public intelligence and the public health.” * 
The conception of the introduction and social effects of an epidemic 
of cholera or yellow fever is sufficiently vivid as not to require illus- 
tration, but the manner of introducing an idea into society and its 
effect is not so apparent. ‘To explain this process Mr. Tarde has reju- 
venated the association of ideas theory in the guise of the laws of 
imitation? or propagation of an idea through the crowd, and it seems © 
important to dwell upon his exposition, though merely the scientific 
statement of what every politician and cultured person knows. 
In his book Mr. Tarde calls his work a study in sociology, and prop- 
erly so; for it is with society that he is dealing. He is not concerned 
with the psychology of the individual as such, but with the psychology 
of the individual as a member of society. This is the fundamental 
presupposition of the whole book; for it is evident that there can be 
no imitation in a society composed of a single person. The work is 
therefore an essay on what the Germans Lazarus and Steinthal 
ealled Vélkerpsychologie, as it treats of the effects arising from a 
large body of persons holding in common one language and the same 
ideas. Society, according to M. Tarde, is an organism made up not 
1Central government. It is to be added that the State and Federal powers 
assured by the Constitution make the use of the word “state” a little ambiguous 
in this connection, unless it be remembered that all the powers not granted to 
Congress are reserved to the States, and that the Supreme Court settles disputed 
cases.

of similar molecules as isthe atmosphere, nor of similar cells as are liv- 
ing bodies, but isan organism made up of similar ideas which have been 
disseminated among the crowd by a process which in its psychological 
aspect may be called imitation, and in its physical may be called repe- 
tition. This process of imitation or repetition is analogous to other 
processes in the universe, to name them: The vibration of the ether 
which results in the phenomena of light and sound, the transmission 
of the characteristics of the progenitor in the process called heredity, 
and even the spread of a disease such as the epidemic called the black 
death during the Middle Ages. Firmly fixed, this conception of a 
society as a self-conservating spiritual organism soon disposes of the 
Aristotelian idea of a division of labor and the social contract and the 
communistic ideas. Society is not a thing of to-day, not a conscious 
convention of its members, not an exchange of mutual services, but 
a nexus of ideas similarly held into which new ideas are being con- 
stantly injected by invention and disseminated by imitation, or, to 
say the same thing in other words, by being repeated over and over 
again in each one of a multitude of units. This manner of regarding 
society as a body of similar ideas gives it a mechanical cast. For in 
order to change society (that is to say, a body of similar ideas held by 
a multitude) a sufficient time must elapse before the new ideas neces- 
sary to produce the change can be sufficiently disseminated to be 
effective. Thus every law passed by a State runs the risk of making 
but feeble inroad upon the body of ideas held by the people if some 
general interest or danger does not promote its observance; but it 
must be noted that under the press of successful revolution or of 
apprehension of great and immediate evil, reforms go to extremes and 
presage anarchy, Cesarism, and a new society. 
Before proceeding to examine the efforts made in England and 
elsewhere in the line of introducing new ideas as to the employment 
and education of children, it is advisable to state the conditions under 
which such interference by the State is thought to be necessary. Let 
us therefore examine the— 
I: SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE SLUMS OF CITIES.! 
There is no subject upon which it is so easy to be sentimental as 
the reformation of the depraved. It is a topic which never wearies 
the reader, and therefore one particularly dangerous to the writer. In 
the following exposition the social conditions of the actually depraved 
_and, so to speak, merely degraded poor will be presented statistically 
and then the figures commented on as briefly as is consistent with 
an attempt to point their meaning. 
1 The statistics of this section are, though somewhat rearranged and recomputed 
taken from the elaborate work of the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, U. S$. Commis- 
sioner of Labor, being obtained by his specialists in pursuance of-an act of Con-

Here are four millions of people, many more than the Republic 
contained when the Constitution was adopted with its preamble 
beginning, ‘‘ We, the people of the United States, in order to form a 
more perfect union, establish justice, and insure domestic tranquil- 
lity,” ete. Among these four millions of city dwellers are found 14 
persons in every 100 separated socially from the other 86 by charac- 
teristics sufficiently obvious to entitle the section in which they dwell 
toa distinctive name, ‘‘the slums,” just as the congregation of moneyed 
persons is called the ‘‘west end,” and the like. <A certain portion of 
these slums in the four cities combined increased its population dur- 
ing a period of three years to the figure of 8 per cent, so that the 
slums are not decreasing. The question is.immediately suggested, 
Are these people Americans? Wave they had the advantages of the 
public schools? Let us see.

That the population of the slums is largely a product of immigra- 
tion there can be no doubt. Sixteen persons in every 100 of the 
population of Baltimore are immigrants, but over 40 persons, almost 
three times as many, in every 100 in the slum district are immigrants. 
Nor is this a full expression of the contribution of the immigrant

population to the slum district, as their children born upon American 
soil are counted as Americans. Having found that the immigrant 
population furnishes possibly as much as two-thirds of the slum pop- 
ulation of a certain typical district of each of the three largest cities 
of the United States, we may now examine into the literary attain- 
ments of the population over 10 years of age. 
8.—Illiteracy (number above 10 years of age unable to read and write in any lan- 
guage living in slum districts examined).

It is quite apparent that one-fourth to one-half of the immigrant 
population can not read or write even in their mother tongue. It is 
also evident that illiteracy is, in the slum districts of the three larger 
cities, six or seven times greater than in the whole city, including, of 
course, all the slums. Certain statistical refinements might be made 
upon this table, but as the object here is merely to show the social 
condition of the slums in its grand lines we pass to the consideration 
of the schooling received by—

whose parents were Americans (2,255 in all) 24.8 were kept at home.” To take the percentage 
on the whole number of children 5 to 14 (16,803) would be unjust to the foreign population, or, 
to put it properly, inaccurate. 
b This would read, if written out: ‘13.4 children in every 100 had American parents.” 
ce This line of percentages has nothing to do with parentage, but in the case to which this foot- 
note is applicable would read: “23.7 children of the 16,803 in the slum district of the four cities 
were kept at home;” and so for each following percentage. 
It is quite clearly shown that the children of the slum districts go 
to school on arriving at the age of 6 or 7. Only six or seven children 
5 to 14 in every 100 of the 16,803 children between those ages are at 
work, at least were so reported. The number of children kept at 
home, not counting the 11,122 under 5, is slightly in favor of the slum 
family having an American-born father, who in the city is the most 
indulgent father in this respect in the world, either through affection 
or neglect. But there is quite a difference between the American and 
the immigrant father in the other columns of the table, though in 
making this remark it is essential to add that 84 per cent of the 16,803 
children spoken of in the table have immigrant fathers and only 16 
per cent American fathers; for statistics is a science of large numbers, 
and numbers so small as 80 or 1,600 are rather inadequate for com- 
parative purposes. 
It might be expected that the general unhygienic conditions of the 
slums would cause a diminution in the size of the family living therein. 
That such is not the case is quite well shown by the following table:

It appears that the slums are more prolific in children than the 
whole city taken together. In Baltimore, in whose slum district the

  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
native American population is one-half larger than the immigrant, 
the slum family is much smaller than the family for the whole city. In 
the four cities there were 11,122 children under 5 years of age born in 
the United States and 1,088 born abroad. In the same districts there 
were 10,484 children 5 to 14 born in the United States and 5,955 born 
abroad; in all, 29,013 children under 15 years of age. We may then 
divide the population of the slums examined in the four cities (83,852) 
into two bodies—those under and those above the age of puberty, 
respectively 29,013 and 54,839 persons. ‘Thus it follows that there 
were nearly two persons 15 years or over for every child below that 
age. The daily home life and, in general, the environment of these 
29,000 children is a matter of some importance, and we are led to 
consider another class of facts.

aThis figure does not include 2,238 workers not reported for the three classes of workers rep- 
resented in the column; to-wit: ‘‘ Domestic and personal service,” “trade and transportation,” 
and “manufactures and mechanical industries.” ‘These three vocations, including the 2,238 
from whom no report was obtained, give employment to 94 per cent of the male population of 
‘the:slums. 
b Not including 625 women workers not reported as to their hours of labor; 78.5 per centof the 
women workers were following the vocations mentioned in note a above. 
The workers of the slums have long hours, and if their daily task 
requires unremitting attention they are longer than modern ideas 
tolerate. It may be said, however, that of the three groups of voca- 
tions represented in the table—domestic and personal service, trade 
and transportation, and manufactures and mechanical industries— 
that manufacturing and mechanical shopwork are much the lowest 
in point of hours of labor providing Sunday be for each group a day 
of xest. 
But the difficulty is that in every year one-third of the working 
population—at least one-third of the 30,438 who report their remuner- 
ation—are unemployed for three months or more. A merely living 
wage, together with instability of employment, is the microbe that, 
in an atmosphere saturated with illiteracy and indecency, breeds the 
city disease called slums, and the question is whether the ordinary 
amount and kind of education will suffice to overcome its effects
-P-A-G-E-707
  LEGAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. 627 
upon the infant character. The dwelling place, the home of the slum 
child, is susceptible of some degree of illustration by the following table: 
7.—Character of the slum home as shown by the amount of rent paid.

  It will be noticed that the four cities may be separated into two 
classes according to the rents shown in the above table, namely, 
a class in which the slum population pay, in a large number of 
instances, a rent of under $2, and a class in which the larger number 
of rents paid is from $1 to $3. 
Thus in Baltimore a little over three-fourths of the “homes” are 
rented for a figure under $2; in Chicago only a little over one-third 
are rented at those figures. Baltimore and Philadelphia are what 
may be called cheap cities. For instance, in Baltimore 13 per cent 
of the salaries (men) are under $5 and 50 per cent between $5 and 
$10, whereas in Chicago, the slum districts of which has a larger negro 
population than Baltimore, 5.5 per cent of the men receive wages 
under $5 a week and 42 per cent between $5 and $10. It is evident 
that more can be done with a dollar in procuring shelter of some kind 
in Baltimore than Chicago. But the question is, What is the duty of 
a dollar in affording its relative part toward maintaining its owner 
and his family in a respectable lodging? It is said that in Germany 
a man of small income ($200 or thereabout) will spend about one-sixth 
of it for his lodging; the proportion is said to be one-eighth; but, 
after all, the value of a dollar depends very much upon the character 
of the person who has it to spend. 
The life of the slum dweller, then, is not so destitute of conveniences 
as the possible derivation of the word from asylum, or place of refuge 
for vagabonds and thieves, might indicate.1_ He is poor, and his work 
is intermittent; these are the great evils of his existence. He lacks 
the idea of permanency of every kind, save his empty stomach and 
pocket. Heis off and on compelled to beg, starve, or to eke out enough 
from his poor wages while working to carry him through the time 
when he is unemployed. His reliance upon his own exertions is 
interfered with by intervals of enforced idleness, during which he is 
compelled to solicit employment like a beggar asking for alms, and 
which, as alms, is frequently given him. This tends to cause him to

feel like a slave, alternately to truckle and snarl. He becomes a 
peculiar kind of character in the body politic, upon which he floats at 
random, strong in body but weak in principles, especially the prin- 
ciple of conservatism, the champion of revolt and the client of the 
demagogue. It is evident that self-protection warrants a State in 
striving to prevent such barbarism that many thousands of children 
should be reared under these conditions. 
Ill: THE OBLIGATION TO ATTEND SCHOOL; OR, COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
In the preceding matter of this chapter it has been assumed that the 
efforts of the Christian priests to break down the pagan practice of 
exposing children was successful, and now to the great reforming and 
protesting monk Martin Luther must be ascribed the first demand for 
compulsory attendance at school. ‘‘I consider the magistrate,” he 
says, ‘“‘bound to compel the citizens (burghers) to send their children 
to school; for if it is proper for the State to compel its citizens to take 
up arms in time of war, much more proper is it for her, both from a 
sense of right and duty, to make them send their children to school.” 
Bugenhagen, the pastor of Wittenberg, went further. At the chris- 
tening of the infant the father was sworn to instruct his children in 
the elements of learning. In short, the education of the people was 
a cardinal doctrine of the Protestant movement of the sixteenth cen- 
tury. Those who led it understood the ‘‘laws of imitation” as 
advanced by M. Tarde. The War of Thirty Years, those of Louis 
XIV, the Seven Years’ War of Frederic of Prussia, and the Napo- 
Jeonic wars put off the realization of compulsory education in Ger- 
many until 1817, when a department of public worship, medical 
affairs, and education was created. By this department a most com- 
prehensive ‘‘entwurf” or bill was prepared, entitled ““Allgemeinen 
Gesetzes tiber die Verfassung des Schulwesens im Preussischen 
Staate” (General provisions regarding the government of the school 
system of the states of Prussia). By this ‘“‘all parents and guard- 
ians are obliged either to use the common public schools for the 
instruction of their children or wards or to provide them with an 
equally good means of obtaining such instruction.” The Catholic 
bishops took a decided stand against the bill (as a whole), claiming 
that what the State had granted to them as an act of grace was not 
as much as the Catholic Church claimed as a right under the canon 
Jaw, the platform of the Council of Trent,’ the Peace of Westphalia,” 
14 congress called to settle the questions threatening the disintegration of the 
Catholic Church, the procedure of which resembled that of a modern congress or 
parliament in which dicta are prepared by committees and then submitted to the 
whole house. Owing to the failure of the reformers to accept the promise of 
safe conduct, the body was composed of 187 Italian delegates, more than half.—

and the decisions of the Imperial Deputies in 1803, by which all school 
matters were made causa ecclesiastica. 
The bill never passed the stage of being a ‘‘sketch of a law,” but 
compulsory education was steadily introduced by the power of Prus- 
sian bureaucratic government until its school system became so com- 
plete as to excite the wonder of Messrs. Guizot and Cousin! in 1833 
and of Mr. Horace Mann several years later. 
A powerful auxiliary and probably the necessary precursor of any 
compulsory school law is a law forbidding the complete monopoliza- 
tion of the years of childhood in labor for the benefit of the parent. 
In some cases this barbarism is, it is claimed, a necessity; but the 
recognition of such necessity gives rise to a cloud of spurious cases. 
The civil law.embodied in the Code Napoleon compels the parent to 
support the child, and in several American States the statutes have 
laid down the same rule. Under such circumstances the head of the 
family as a political person is not apt to be so hostile to having the 
child educated, even though he regard the child as a mere encum- 
brance naturally following the gratification of his sexual instincts. 
In 1839 the Prussian Government forbid the employment of children 
under 9 years of age in any factory or mining establishment, nor 
might any person under 16 years who had not attended school three 
years or more and who could not read or write be so employed. It is 
quite possible to believe that there is no illiteracy in Germany. 
In England it is necessary to make law in a different way. Nota pub- 
lic bureau, but public conscience must be aroused. In 1837 Mr. Dick- 
ens wrote his novel of Oliver Twist. There is a scene in that pictur- 
ing the magistrates as refusing to indenture the boy, Twist, as a 
chimney sweep to a man plying that vocation. In 1840 there is also a 
‘‘chimney sweepers and chimneys regulation act.” By that act every 
indenture of apprenticeship to ‘‘any person using the trade or busi- 
ness of a chimney sweeper” is null and void if the child be under 16 
years of age. In 1867 this was supplemented by the act with the 
bizarre title of ‘‘The agricultural gangs act,” by which it is enacted 
that ‘‘ whereas in certain counties in England certain persons known 
as gangmasters hire children, young persons, and women, with a 
view to contracting with farmers and others for the execution on their 
lands of various kinds of agricultural work. Be it enacted, (1) That 
no child under the age of 10 years shall be employed in any agricul- 
tural gang. (2) No females shall be employed in the same gang with 
males. (3) No female shall be employed in any gang under any 
licensed male gangmaster unless a female licensed to act as gangmaster 
  
Cousin’s report is well known to American readers in translation by Miss Aus- 
tin. The French law of 1833 carried through by the government of Guizot was 
, the first for France. Napoleon and the mathematician Monge had laughed at 
Pastalozzi in 1803, when that worthy was a Swiss deputy at Paris. His system, 
as is well known, was eagerly caught at in Prussia after the downfall of Napoleon.

is also present with that gang;” and the justices were empowered to 
limit the distances within which the children were to travel on foot. 
In 1873 no child over 8 years of age could be employed in agricultural 
work unless proving that the child, if under 10, had attended school 
250 times, and if over 10, had attended school 150 times, during the 
preceding year. In 1878 the factory and workshop act was passed, 
preventing the employment of children under 10 or on Sunday, and 
regulating the attendance at school of children legally employed in 
factories. In 1866 an industrial school act was passed, so comprehen- 
sive in its scope and minute in its details, and, withal, so controverted 
as an efficient machine that it must be passed with a mere reference. 
By the ‘‘custody of children act,” 1891, it is laid down that where the 
parent of a child applies to the high court or the court of sessions for a 
writ or order for the production of the child, and the court is of opinion 
that the parent has abandoned or deserted the child, or that he has 
otherwise so conducted himself that the court should refuse to enforce 
his right to the custody of the child, the court may, in its discretion, 
decline to issue the writ or make the order. 
In France the civil code of the first Empire defined the power of 
the parents to be ‘‘a right founded upon nature and confirmed by the 
law which gives to the father and the mother, during a certain limited 
time and under certain conditions, the surveillance of the body (per- 
sonne) and the administration and enjoyment of the property (biens) 
of their children. In 1875 a reconstruction of French society was 
begun by the Republic by attacking the gross ignorance and super- 
stition of the peasantry and the fatal self-complacency of the pro- 
vinecial bourgeoisie and of the people who dwelt in the city of Paris. 
Free public schools, or ‘gratuité,” compulsory attendance, or ‘‘obli- 
gation,” nonsectarian teachers, or “‘laicité,” and finally the loss of 
control of his child by the unworthy father, ‘“‘La déchéance de la puis- 
sance paternelle,” followed in regular order as fast as the Govern- 
ment found itself strong enough to cope with the opponents—royalists, 
imperialists, and sectarians—that its audacious plan of campaign 
encouraged to open resistance. 
In the United States the enfranchisement of several millions of 
negroes gave rise to much examination of the question of illiteracy 
during the ratification of the fourteenth amendment to the Federal 
Constitution. Illiteracy had never been so frequent among the peo- 
ple of the Northern States as to create alarm. The situation in the 
new South was anxiously considered, and a national bureau was 
ereated to collect and disseminate information upon the topic of 
edueation. The census of 1870 opened up unpleasant vistas of popu-

voluminous reports.

lar ignorance which the census of 1880 defined. In the manufactur- 
ing States of the North a new danger menaced popular government. 
The growth of the factory system and the influx of illiterate foreign- 
ers called for resolute measures. The difficulty was magnified by 
the attempt to set up a rival system to the State at the expense of the 
State. At the present day State after State is adopting compulsory- 
attendance laws, which give great offense to those who see in such 
measures not the safety but the destruction of popular government 
and to those whese particular interests are not forwarded by such 
laws. 
The compulsory school attendance laws have passed through one 
and have entered upon asecond stage. In the earlier stage, each law 
was a mere brutum fulmen, incapable of anything save needlessly to 
ereate strife. A compulsory-attendance law requires two factors: 
Agents and seating capacity to carry it out. These desiderata seem 
to have been the cause of the failure of the early school laws, which 
were practically merely expressions of opinion as to what the local 
school bodies should do in the premises. In the other, or second 
stage, which is now coming into being, the laws are less bland, less 
general. A school is defined, the English language is to be taught, 
private schools are open to inspection as far as their attendance is 
concerned, officers are appointed to carry out the law, and the employ- 
ment of children is regulated or forbidden. Much, therefore, depends 
upon the courts. A summary of their conclusions in the past is now 
given. 
CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE STATE, 
It was a maxim of the Roman law that each must bear the burden 
of his own faults (Quod quis ex culpa sua damnum sentit, non intel- 
ligitur damnum sentire).' This is morally true of States as well as 
legally true of men and corporations. The errorsof the parents should 
not heedlessly be left to be visited upon a future citizen. For if in 
the organization of a State and the course of the industries it fosters 
opportunities are given for harm to happen to the child, the eulpa- 
bility of the State is that of the railroad corporation against whom 
it was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that it 
had been guilty of contributory negligence in placing a machine in a 
place where children would probably resort to it and meddle with it, 
as the child injured had done. The brief of this decision reads as 
follows, quoting the court:? 
1. While it is a general rule in regard to an adult that to entitle him to recover 
damages for an injury resulting from the fault or negligence of another he must 
himself have been free from fault, such is not the rule in regard to an infant of

“spirit of the decided cases.”

tender years. The care and caution required of a child is according to his matu- 
rity and capacity only, and this is to be determined in each case by the circum- 
stances of that case. 
THE RIGHT OF THE STATE TO EXCULPATE ITSELF, 
In the matter of Donohue et al., in New York, Mr. Justice West- 
brook remarks: ; 
The right of the State to care for its children has always and with very great 
propriety been exercised. Under its laws, whenever the welfare of the child has 
demanded, its courts have frequently interfered for the protection of children of 
tender years. It has again and again taken them from one parent and given them 
to the other, or has refused so to do, the good and the welfare of the child being 
the object always in view. It has so acted without the intervention of a jury,and 
that power has never been supposed to have been improperly exercised because a 
jury was not allowed and due process of law not had. If the courts of the State 
may, by virtue of their general powers, interfere for the protection and care of 
children, it is not seen why the legislature may not prescribe the cases in which 
children shall be rescued from their custodians and a mode provided for their 
summary disposition. For example, if children should be placed to learn the busi- 
ness of stealing, could not the legislature provide a summary remedy for the evil? 
Has the law no power to rescue summarily female children held for the purposes 
of prostitution or interfere in an expeditious manner in very many cases when 
children of tender years are exposed to peril or temptation? (Cf. the English 
act page 630.) 
THE UNITY OF GENERAL OR PUBLIC LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
In his Digest of Anglo-Muhammadan Law’ Sir R. K. Wilson observes 
that a task such as his should have to be performed in England by an 
Englishman who has only once casually visited India is doubtless an 
anomaly, but it is accounted for, like so many others, by the one huge 
anomaly of the government of 250,000,000 Asiatics from the banks 
of the Thames. ‘‘‘Mahommedan Law compiled from authorities in 
the original Arabic’ by a descendant (Syed Ameer Ali) of the prophet 
and an ardent defender of the Moslem faith is, he continues, one thing, 
my ‘Anglo-Muhammadan Law’ quite another thing. For Mr. Ameer 
Ali, the eloquent author of The Spirit of Islam, to have made a per- 
fectly colorless and pedantically accurate law book in his ‘Mahom- 
medan Law, compiled from authorities in the original Arabie,’? would 
have been little short of a miracle, and in his case the miracle has not 
happened. It is my business to direct attention simply and solely

to what the British Government at the present time requires to be 
enforced as law for its Muhammadan subjects (about 40,000,000 of the 
250,000,000), and for them alone.” The necessary changes being made, 
Mr. Herbert Cowell, in the preface to his ‘‘The Hindu Law, as admin- 
istered exclusively to Hindus (140,000,000) by the British courts in 
India,” could have made exactly the same remarks as those just quoted 
from Sir Roland Wilson’s preface and any Anglican writer who should 
attempt to digest what is meted out as law to the Buddhist subjects, 
of whom there are 3,000,000 owing nominal political allegiance to the 
Empress of India, might say the same. In short, while European law 
rests upon the people freely legislating to meet the demands of their 
own time, the Asiatic law rests upon ingenious commentations upon 
the utterances of holy men.!. Any proposition, therefore, looking to 
the classification of children into sects by requiring a different set of 
officials, of tax lists, and a different method of treatment is a political 
evil that the Preamble of the Federal Constitution points as danger- 
ous legislation. Efforts have been made, however, to make such dis- 
tinctions as will appear from the matter now given: 
In Louisiana a municipal corporation passed an ordinance allowing 
goods to be sold on Sunday by a number of citizens who believe, upon 
historical grounds, that Sunday comes on Saturday, while other citi- 
zens who believe that Sunday is the day of rest were prohibited from 
enjoying the privilege of keeping their stores open both on Saturday 
and Sunday: Held by the supreme court?” to be partial legislation, and 
therefore unconstitutional. 
In Kentucky, one of the States where the negro’s aboriginal igno- 
rance and century of involuntary servitude, together with the bitter- 
ness arising from a long and sanguinary conflict, made it desirable to 
educate that race apart from the Caucasian race, the Federal court 
held (1873) that a law was unconstitutional and void because it directed 
that the tax collected from white persons for support of public schools 
should be used exclusively for schools for that race and that the tax 
collected for colored persons should be reserved exclusively for schools 
for that race.* The supreme court of North Carolina, in Pruitt v. 
Commissioners of Gaston County (1886), took the same grounds. 
Indeed, this principle has been carried (leaving out of consideration 
its fundamental importance to a democracy) to an amusing length. 
In California, in the case of Lin Sing v. Washburn (20 Cal., 534), it 
was held that an ordinance of the city of San Francisco was void

because in requiring every inmate of the county jail to have his hair \ 
eut to within 1 inch of his sealp there was an intent to show dislike 
of Mongolian persons. In a Maryland case, where a police regulation 
declared that ‘‘no black Republican” should be employed by the 
police board, the supreme court of the State refused to take cognizance 
of such distinctions as being unworthy of notice, and in another 
State, where the affidavits of three “‘ unconditional Union men” were 
required to remand a case of changed venue, the court disdainfully 
swept the distinction aside as invidious and therefore unconstitu- 
tional. In conclusion, it may be said that when for some physical 
characteristic or a peculiar belief a part of the community become 
notoriously segregated for a sufficient length of time, the isolated part 
or caste indubitably incur the dislike of the larger part of the com- 
munity, and are only protected by the law and the respectful though 
sometimes distasteful obedience all true citizens accord it. 1 
POWER OF THE STATE TO TAX FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES, 
It is admitted, says Chief Justice Marshall, in one of those decisions 
which have put vitality into the idea of Federal Government both at 
home and in Europe, and causes the author to bear the same relations 
to the constitutional law of the United States that Lord Mansfield 
bore to the commercial law of England,‘ it is admitted that the power 
of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very exist- 
ence of government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects 
to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the Govern- 
ment may choose to carry it. The only security against the abuse of 
this power, he continues, is found in the structure of the Government 
itself. In imposing a tax the legislature acts upon its constituents. 
This is in general a sufficient security against erroneous and oppres- 
sive taxation.? The only consistent argument against this power of 
the State to tax a childless citizen for the education of other people’s 
children is that of Mr. Herbert Spencer in his Coming Slavery. 
“English legislators,” says the philosopher of the unknowable, ‘‘ who 
in 1833 voted £20,000 a year to aid in building schoolhouses, never 
supposed that the step they then took would lead to forced contribu- 
tions, local and general, now amounting to £6,000,000. They did not 
intend to establish the principle that A should be made responsible 
for educating B’s offspring.” The ready answer to which is that had 
they known as much in 1833 as they knew in 1885 they, as men over 
21 years of age and competent to judge, probably would have begun 
with £6,000,000 instead of the grant of an amount that is bequeathed 
by half a dozen American testators to single institutions in the course

of a year; for a national education is a national drill, irrespective of 
the amount of the individual profit the cadet may derive from it, as 
has been remarked by the Puritan and Jesuit fathers and M. Tarde 
in his work on Imitation. National education may not make savants, 
but it softens the brutality of the asperities produced by failure or 
success through the operation of the most powerful and persistent 
lien in human nature, that of childhood recollections. 
To what degree the State shall provide for the education of the peo- 
ple at public expense is a matter to be determined by the legislature, 
subject to such limitations as may have been introduced by the people 
of the several States in the State constitutions. An examination of 
these constitutions shows considerable variation in the provision made 
for education. The people of Pennsylvania in 1873 ordered their leg- 
islature to ‘“‘ provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough, 
efficient, and nonsectarian system of schools,” and also to “‘appropri- 
ate not less than $1,000,000 annually for that purpose,” while the 
people of Texas in 1876 ordered their legislature ‘“‘to make suitable 
provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of 
public free nonsectarian schools,” but in another part of the instru- 
ment, in limiting the right of the legislature to tax, they express 
themselves thus: 
The legislature shall not have the right to levy taxes or impose burdens upon the 
people, except to raise revenue sufficient for the economical administration of the 
government, in which may be included the following purposes: * * * The sup- 
port of public schools, in which shall be included colleges and universities estab- 
lished by the State; and the maintenance and support of the Agricultural College 
of Texas.! 
In default of judicial interpretation of the exact meaning of the 
provisions concerning education found in the constitutions of each 
of the States, as related to other parts of those instruments, it is nec- 
essary to refer to a compilation made in a former report of this 
Bureau.! 
An early discussion in regard to the interpretation and meaning of 
the provisions of the constitution of the State of Pennsylvania is that 
of the Hon. Jeremiah S. Black, subsequently Attorney-General of the 
United States during Mr. Buchanan’s Administration, while chief jus- 
tice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania. That court, in 1851, was 
asked by one Hartman to be restored to the position of a school 
director in a certain district from which he and the other elected 
members of the board had been ousted by the court of quarter ses- 
sions of Lehigh eee These persons when elected had organized

Louisiana ‘The legislature can not force a parish [county] to levy a [local?] tax

public schools in Louisiana is a State institution, for which the State is required 
to provide by taxation or otherwise. 42 Ann.

themselves as a board and then refused both to establish the common 
schools required by the law under which they had been elected and 
to resign. The law (quite new) required schools to be established 
for ‘‘every individual 5 to 21 who cared to apply.” The constitution 
only required the legislature to ‘‘ provide schools throughout the State 
in such a manner that the poor may be taught gratis.” Upon this 
very interesting and complicated issue the court said: 
The whole ground on which this court has been urged to reverse the order of 
the quarter sessions is that the law is unconstitutional. We are cf opinion that 
there is nothing in that law—certainly nothing in that part of it to which our 
attention has been particularly called—which in the slightest degree contravenes 
the constitution. It is to be remembered that the rule of interpretation for the 
State constitution differs totally from that which is applicable to the Constitution 
of the United States. The latter instrument must have a strict construction; the 
former a liberal one. * * * The powers not granted to the Government of the 
Union are withheld, but the State retains every attribute of authority which is 
not taken away. In applying this principle to the present case, it is enough to say 
that there is no syllable in the constitution of Pennsylvania which forbids the leg- 
islature to provide for a system of general education in any way which they in 
their own wisdom may think best. * * * 
The constitution of Pennsylvania provides that ‘‘the legislature shall, as soon 
as conveniently may be, provide by law for the establishment of schools through- 
out the State in such a manner that the poor may be taught gratis. It seems to 
be believed that the last clause of this section is a limitation to the power of the 
legislature and that no law can be constitutional which looks to any other object 
than that of teaching the poor gratis. The error of these who make this argu- 
ment consists in supposing this provision of the constitution to define the maxi- 
mum of the legislative power, while in truth it only fixesthominimum, Itenjoins 
them to do thus much, but does not forbid them to do more. If they stop short 
of that point, they fail in their duty; but it does not result from this that they 
have no authority to go beyond it.! 
There is another interesting decision upon this point, though not in 
the proper sense a decision at law, but rather what in the Roman law 
might have been called a responsum prudentium. 
On being requested, the supreme judicial court of Maine informed the house of 
representatives of the legislature of that State to this effect (abstract): 
By the constitution of Maine (article 4) the legislature has ‘‘full power to make 
and establish all reasonable laws and regulations for the defense and benefit of the 
people of this State, not repugnant to this constitution nor to that of the United 
States.” * * * Education being of benefit to the people and taxation being 
incidental to its successful promotion, a general tax for educational purposes must 
be constitutional unless forbidden or restricted by the constitution. The consti- 
tution, indeed, orders the legislature to require the towns to make, at their own 
expense, suitable provisions for the support and maintenance of publie schools, but 
this is mandatory, not prohibitory.? (Cf. Black’s decision above.) 
Questions arise as to the power of the State to provide secondary 
and normal schools. A leading decision in this matter is that of Hon. 
Thomas M. Cooley, while one of the justices of the supreme court of

Michigan. In Stuart v. School District No. 1 of Kalamazoo (30 Mich.), 
it is laid down that school authorities in union school districts may levy 
taxes upon the general public for the support of high schools, and 
such taxation may be used for instruction in foreign languages, and 
that there is nothing in the educational State policy of Michigan or 
the State constitution restricting the primary school districts of the 
State in the branches of knowledge which their officers may cause to 
be taught or the grade of instruction that may be given, if the voters 
of the district consent, in regular form, to bear the expense and raise 
the tax for the purpose, or to prevent instruction in the classics and 
living modern languages in these schools.1_ Normal schools, as neces- 
sary to the full development of free schools, may be established by 
the legislature.? 
THE SUZERAINTY OF THE STATE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COMMON OR PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS. 
Perhaps no more important decision touching the public character 
and hence the unity of the public schools has been made than that of 
the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts in the case of Rawson v. 
Spencer (1873). This issue, squarely stated, may be thus expressed: 
‘Shall there be 1 or 1,834 or more centers of general educational con- 
trol in the State of Massachusetts?” The opinion of the court was 
delivered by Mr. Justice Colt, and was directed and pointed by the 
following circumstances: The two laws of 1869 abolishing school dis- 
tricts in Massachusetts were contested by,the original defendant as 
(1) confiscating property without just compensation, (2) as laying 
unequal taxes, and (3) as impairing the obligation of contracts,® upon 
which the court said: 
The laws in question were enacted in the legitimate exercise of that power by 
which the legislature may require the performance of certain public duties by 
different municipal agencies at its discretion. Before the enactment of these laws 
school districts were indeed quasi corporations, with the power to hold property, 
to raise money by taxation for the support of schools, and with certain defined 
public duties. But they were public and political as distinguished from private 
corporations, and their rights and powers were held at the will of the legislature, 
to be modified or abolished as public welfare might require. The laws in ques- 
tion do nothing more. They provide for the transfer of public property and of a 
public duty connected with its use from one public corporation to another. * * * 
There is no attempt to provide compensation in the sense in which compensation 
is required when private property is taken for public use under the right of 
eminent domain. The right here exercised is quite distinct from that and requires

® Under the laws of 1869, passed by the legislature of Massachusetts, the ‘‘ Town 
of Uxbridge,” a political division of that State containing several school districts, 
proceeded to take possession of all the property owned by such school districts, 
and to appraise the value of the same.
-P-A-G-E-718
  . 638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
no provision for compensation. Nor do these laws authorize taxation which, 
under the bill of rights, must be regarded as not reasonable and proportional. 
The benefits to be enjoyed from public improvements and the use of public prop- 
erty can not be alike equal to all under any system. They are no more unequal 
under these laws than if districts had never existed or had not been abolished. 
The obligation of contracts is not impaired. Someof the districts may be in debt, 
but the rights of the creditors are in no way prejudiced. The taxpayers of the 
district are sufficiently protected by the assumption of all these debts by the town. 
In an ingenious legal argument it was claimed in a Rhode Island 
ease (St. Joseph’s Church v. Assessors, 12 R. 1.) that certain property 
belonging to that church but used for the purpose of maintaining a 
school free to all without charge was a public school and therefore 
not subject to taxation. The court would not entertain such a prop- 
osition and drew the distinction on the difference between free 
schools supported by the State for which it was answerable and the 
free schools of a system unfriendly to the State system and with which 
the State had very little if anything to do. 
But though the judicial branch of the Government has steadfastly 
refused to allow the imperium of the State to be split up among the 
innumerable sects and faddists, which are inevitable in a government 
based on universal toleration and equality before the law, it is not to 
be understood that the personages whom the State calls into official 
being are thereby endowed with a temporary patent of dictatorship. 
Quite the contrary; it is Christian humility rather than pagan self- 
assertion that the courts require from public-school officers in the dis- 
charge of their duties. Nevertheless it must be confessed that the 
question turns on what is *‘reasonable.” In a Wisconsin case (Mor- 
row v. Wood, 35 Wis.) it appears from a case much complicated by 
the corporal punishment of a boy—now by the parent for studying 
what the rules of the school required, and now by the teacher for the 
boy’s refusing to study what his father had punished him for study- 
ing—that a requirement to study geography is ‘‘ unreasonable ” if the 
parent in thinking so does not wish the authorities to introduce a new 
study for the parental benefit. On the other hand it has been laid 
down as ‘‘reasonable” that the power of the school committee to 
make all reasonable rules and regulations for the government, disci- 
pline, and management of public schools gave them the right to have 
the school opened with prayer and Bible reading notwithstanding 
certain parents claimed that these proceedings, during which their 
children are obliged to be at least physically present, are religious 
rites or ceremonies highly obnoxious to those parents for reasons 
satisfactory to themselves and their spiritual advisers. The first 
decision has been specially accepted as sound in an Illinois case (1877) 
and specifically repudiated (1879) as false in a New Hampshire case. 
There are two great classes of these cases. One class is composed 
of those cases in which from some whimsical desire of the parent to

experiment or from some mental or moral bias an attempt is made to 
dislocate the routine of the schools by having this or that study of 
the established curriculum omitted for the parent’s special benefit, 
while the other class is composed of eases in which it is attempted to 
have the atmosphere of the public school saturated as far as possible 
with the forms and usages of this or that particular creed. No gen- 
eral rule may be drawn from the eases decided except that in the 
North Atlantic States the courts have adhered to the idea of an undi- 
vided, impartial, and nonsectarian system of public schools in which 
no scholar is to be favored by the omission or addition of studies; for 
this would be practically, though indirectly, legalizing and support- 
ing some particular kind of worship or some private business enter- 
prise, as in the Wisconsin case above cited, where the father forbid 
the teacher to teach geography to his boy because he (the father) 
‘wanted the boy to assist him to keep accounts.” - 
Norse A.—THE PRINCIPLE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOL. 
It is a propensity of the mind, as natural as it is frequently productive of error, 
to be guided by superficial resemblances, The more apparent these resemblances 
are, the more quickly an opinion is formed and the less inducement there is to 
seek or even to care for the deeper principles, though these, too, may lie quite near 
the surface, upon which the matter considered is based. For the American stu- 
dent of European education, considering such education as a department of goy- 
ernment, a reflection of this kind is essential, for he must at the very outset of his 
investigations represent to himself the exact import of the term which M. Emile 
de Layeleye has used as a title to his book, L’instruction du Peuple. This 
instruction of the people has other names, such as popular instruction, but the 
common name given to it in the Latin countries of Europe is primary instruction, 
while in the Germanic parts of central Europe it is called Volkschulwesen, or the 
system of schools for the masses. 
This species of education, or rather this education as applied to a specific portion 
of the population of a country, is intended for the common people or peasantry or 
lower orders, as the poor and uneducated inhabitants of the rural districts, espe- 
cially, and the artisans and other wage earners of cities are invariably called. In 
Europe the original intention of modern attempts at educating these classes may 
” be said to have been—paradoxical as it may appear—a reaction of at least one of 
the most humiliated monarchies of the Old World against the popular uprising 
known as the French Revolution, and the cry of emancipation raised by that revo- 
lution of ‘‘ Liberty, fraternity, equality.” But the appearance of paradox seems 
still more pronounced when it is considered that this very effort of a helpless 
monarchy to preserve itself from extinction should be apparently the same as that 
adopted by at least one republic in the new world to preserve its democratic insti- 
tutions. Whether this indeed be a paradox merits investigation. A government 
is undoubtedly a government, whether in Europe or America, but a monarchy, 
though a government for the people, is neither a government by nor from the 
people. 
Irrespective of the social status of the individual to whom given, the kind of 
education called in Europe ‘‘primary ” or ‘‘popular” instruction has two charac- 
teristics which there distinguish it from all other systems of class education. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-720
  
  640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
first of these is that the schools are supported by taxation specifically laid upon 
the whole property of a community or a locality. The other characteristic is that 
such schools give instruction without cost to the pupil, except as far as his prop- 
erty or that of his parents or their labor is taxed to support the schools. These 
characteristics are in certain countries of Europe the outgrowth of a set purpose 
of their governments to strengthen the state by a process denominated national 
education, the keynote of which in Germany is the cry of Gott und Vaterland 
and in France is now La Patrie, though in the days of the French Revolution 
and the First Republic the cry was Liberté, Fraternité, Egalité, as before 
remarked. 
The first system of national education was conceived and set on foot in the 
Kingdom of Prussia at the epoch of her greatest humiliation, during the Napole- 
onic wars. ‘We have hit upon the idea,” says Stein, the head of Prussian polit- 
ical affairs, ‘that it is necessary to inspire the whole nation with a spirit of 
morality, of religion, and of patriotism.” ‘We have lost a part of our territory,” 
said the King, ‘‘and our renown as a nation is lost; but this is a reason why we 
should develop our intellectual power, and to this end I desire that everything 
shall be done to extend and render perfect the education of the people.” It was 
the philosopher Fichte, however, who, in his addresses to the German people, first 
fostered the idea of a national as distinguished from a cosmopolitan idea of educa- 
tion. It is scarcely necessary to say that Fichte’s scheme was preponderatingly 
ethical and national in character. 
This “ primary instruction” or ‘national education” is not regarded in Europe 
as in any way connected with culture. Mr. Matthew Arnold calls secondary 
instruction the first stage of a liberal education, and then goes on to say that Eton 
College (a secondary school), however defective otherwise, at least teaches her 
aristocratic pupils virtues which are among the best virtues of an aristocracy— 
freedom from affectation, manliness, a high spirit, and simplicity—and offers to 
her nonaristocratic pupils the benefits of contact with aristocracy, though ata 
too considerable outlay in money. Secondary education of this description is quite 
jealous, for the pupil is taken at a very early age by the authorities of the sec- 
ondary school in which his education is to be effected, and whether in the “‘little 
college” of the French lycée or the progymnasium of the German gymnasium or 
in the lower forms of the English “public school” (Eton, Rugby, and the rest), 
he is carefully prepared for the liberal education of the secondary department 
proper of his school. 
Such is the object of popular education as distinguished from aristocratic educa- 
tion in Europe. Turning to America, do we find the same conception of elemen- 
tary education? There was a time during the first quarter of the present century 
when, inadvertently, through the anxiety of philanthropy rather than by premed- 
itation, the people of the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, 
and South Carolina were classed as rich and poor. Mr. Hamilton, during his 
term as governor of South Carolina, is said to have expressed himself in regard to 
elementary public schools in the following terms: ‘‘The free-school system has 
failed. Its failure is owing to the fact that it does not suit our people, our gov- 
ernment, or our institutions. The paupers for whose children it is intended need 
them at home to work.” The same hostility of the native American ‘lower 
classes” to having their children marked as something of a lower order occurred 
in Pennsylvania, where the ‘‘poor-school system” was a most decided failure. 
Indeed, the principal motive that induces the parent to make sacrifices that his 
child mnay attend school is that it may become versed in the attainments that make

alady oragentleman. So widespread had this desire to be genteel become that to 
correct it some years ago a very determined effort was made to introduce into the 
public school curriculum instruction in the mechanic arts. 
This, then, is the difference between the idea of the education of the masses of 
Europe and the idea prevailing in the education given by the public schools of the 
United States: In Europe the object is to absorb the individual in the contempla- 
tion of his duty to obey; in America the object is, to express the matter in the term 
used by one of our poets, Excelsior.! 
1 For the student of this phase of elementary and ‘high school” education, for they are insep- 
arable in the United States, it is indispensable to familiarize himself with Theory of Education 
in the United States, prepared for the Vienna Exposition (Harris), and the article Etats Unis in 
Buisson’s Dictionnaire de Pedagogie (Philbrick); for the administrative and financial side, the 
first section of the Report of the Committee of Twelve (Hinsdale); for the pedagogical side, the 
report of the subcommittee of five in the Report of the Committee of Fifteen (Harris), and also 
the Report of the Committee of Ten. A chapter published by this Bureau containing the pro- 
visions and expressions which occur in the constitution of each of the several States (Hinsdale) 
will serve as a sort of yade mecum in following the course of the education idea in the United 
States.

in 1858 from United States and 
was put to the credit of the 
United States surplus revenue. 
  Was given away per capita'to 
local units, but $5,000 was 
set apart as a separate school fund, at 6 per cent, 
for the benefit of the terri- 
tory then in dispute be- tween the United States 
and the British Empire. 
The $700,000. received was dis- 
tributed tothe towns,some 
fifty of which seem to have 
kept the money, about 
$30,000, invested for school purposes, yielding about 
$1,800 annually. 
Appropriated to towns for 
school or other purposes. 
The amount received was 
$669,087. ‘The interest, at 6 per cent, was to be spades 
to support of schools. In 
1885it wastound that ‘most, 
of the towns apply the in- 
come to the support of 
schools.” 
The amount, $1,338,000, was giventotowns. Ofthissum 
about $25,000 were devoted 
by over one hundred towns 
to educational purposes. 
The $382,000 received was 
originally devoted to edu- 
cation, and to it was added 
$4,276 from sale of public 
lands. The State borrowed 
all but $155,541, and then 
constituted that amount a 
permanent school fund, to 
which it subsequently added $11,192 surplus State 
revenue in 1860, The State 
pays no formal interest on this, which, at 6 per cent, 
would amount to $10,000. 
  Allsurplus of the 1-mill State

Sale of public (originally mostly Federal) lands. 
Connecticut: In 1733 the pro- 
ceeds of the sale of ‘‘seven 
new towrships” (one*brought 
£6,800, another £1,225) in the colony were divided among the towns, as also in 1765 ‘cer- 
tain sums due for excise on 
goods,” the interest in both cases to be forever applied to 
the support of common schools. In relinquishing all claim to 
“Western lands” in 1782 Con- 
necticut excepted the ‘“ West- 
ern reserve” as Georgia did 
the Indian lands within her 
borders (as related below), 
which, when sold in 1795, real- 
ized $1,200,000. By judicious 
investment this original sum 
had nearly doubled by 1840. The Western reserve con- 
tained 3,300,000 acres. 
New York: In 1784 the “Stand 
lands” were laid off into blocks 
10 miles square, subdivided 
into lots of 640 acres, one such lot in each block being re- 
served for promoting educa- 
tion and the gospel and an- 
other for promoting litera- ture (1786). ‘These formed the 
basis of the local school funds 
and of the State literary fund. 
Both funds received some in- 
erements by further land 
grants and the literary fund some for losses by grants in fee 
to specific institutions of ‘*lit- 
erary lots.” Theliterary fund 
is now $284,201. In 1805 the 
common-school fund was es- 
tablished by the grant of 500,- 000 acres, the income from the 
roceeds of which was not to 
e distributed until the in- 
come reached $50,000. The 
fund is now $4 373,000. New Jersey: All money re-

The amount_received, ‘$764,- 600, was deposited with 
towns, interest on one-half 
to be used for schools; in- 
terest on other half for ordi- 
nary local expenses. Prac- tically three-fourths of the 
interest was used for 
schools until 1855, when the 
whole income was used for 
them. Some towns have 
wholly or partially lost the money. 
The United States deposit fund is the original sum of 
$4,014,500. The “academies” 
get $30,000 for teachers’ training classes and the 
school district libraries 
$55,000. The rest of the in- 
come apparently goes to- ward the payment of pub- 
lic-school teachersand some 
portion is added to the 
common-school fund.    
The amount received, $764,-

the counties asa trust. In 
1867 the State required the 
whole income to be used for 
schools. In1876 the income 
is $30,524. Probably there 
was nota county where the fund remained intact. Six- teen out of 21 counties set 
apart amounts equal to the

the encouragement of learn- 
ing. These accumulations 
were increased in 1816 by 
the war debt due from the 
United States. This fund 
supported the ‘pauper schools of Virginia,” Mr. 
Jefferson's plan for a State 
system being set aside for

ricultural fund were to be a 
part of the school fund. All 
proceeds from United States 
and swamp lands are now a 
part of that fund. 
TENNESSEE: Congress gave one 
section in every township of public lands. In 1823 the State 
created a school fund by sell- 
ing vacant lands and paid the 
money into the Bank of Ten- 
nessee, the school fund subse- 
juently ne a part of 
the capital of that bank, which 
art, in 1858, was limited to ,500,000. ‘The bank (a State 
institution) had a capital of 
$5,000,000. which was made up 
of the surplus revenue of 1836, 
the school fund, and additional

and in 1792 another 1,000 acres 
was granted to each county 
for a county academy. The 
State had reserved the right 
to the Indian lands within her 
borders when ceding her 
claims tothe “ Western lands” 
in 1782, the United States 
engaging to pay the Indians 
$1,200,000 for their lands.   Of the amount received, $1,433,754, $85.000 was ‘‘for- 
ever dedicated to publi 
instruction,” and was in- 
vested in “internal-im- 
provement bonds.” Astho schemes of improvements 
were unfortunate, the State 
appears to have shouldered

Fiorrpa: Thesixteenth-section 
lands for public schools 
amounted to 908,503 acres. In 
1882 there were reported as yet unsold 650,000acres (under acts 
of May 20, 1826; June 15, 1844, 
and February 26,1857) and a 
school fund of $326,420, invest- 
ed mostly in State bonds. To 
this, one-fourth of the pro- 
ceeds from the sale of public 
lands now or hereafter owned 
by the State. 
ALABAMA: 902,774acres were re- 
ceived in 1819 for common 
schools (sixteenth-section 
lands). Capitalizing the inter- est received on this fund in 
1875 at 6 per cent, the fund 
may be theoretically placed at $2,449,000. Many of these lands areleased by the *‘ town- 
ship superintendents ” andare 
sold by vote of township. 
There is much litigation about 
  title between State and claim- | 
ants. Mississtppr: There were 817,534 | acres of sixteenth-section 
lands. These were distributed 
to townships, who now hold a 
permanent fund of $197,421, rom which, with rents, they 
derived in 1895 $26,890. The 
Chickasaw land fund is held 
by the State and amounts to 
$854,583, with 30,000 acres of 
land; interest, $51,000. 
Lovurtstana: There were 786,044 
acres of sixteenth-section 
lands which were converted 
into bonds and were at the 
date of 1872, 834 State bonds of 
$1,000, 35 State bonds of $500, 
272 city bonds of $1,000—in all, 
$! 000. If appears that 
these bonds were sold in 1872, and an investigating commit- 
tee of 1878 uses the expression, 
“The abolishment of the free- 
school fund in 1872.” The rent 
of school lands in 1894 
amounted $5,070, and the inter- 
est on sixteenth-section fund 
to $14,000. 
Missouri: There were 985,000 
acres of sixtcenth-section 
lands. In 1892 the school fund 
was made up of $2,909,000 State 
certificates at 6 per cent, $231,- 
000.at5 percent. In addition, 
there was a “permanent 
county public-school fund” of $3,783,539, a ‘permanent town- ship public-school fund” of 
$3,370,369, and a “permanent. district public-school fund” 
of $59,407. The proceeds from 
the sixteenth-section lands 
(permanent. county public- school fund) seem to include 
the land sold for the benefit of 
the permanent township- 
school fund. Swamp land 
seems to have been giventothe 
school fund,as the Stato board 
in 1879 was directed ‘‘to look 
into what the counties had 
done withthem.”’ These lands 
amounted to 3,300,000 acres. 
    None received.... 
The $669,000 received was de- 
posited in the State Bank, 
and in 1840 the interest was 
to form a part of the $200,000 
required of the bank to es- 
tablish a system of public schools. In 1848 “it was 
considered doubtful 
whether the university and 
school funds and the sur- 
us revenue would ever

had failed. (Amn. Alma- 
nac, 1848.) See next column.

In 1895 the leased lands yielded 
$177,438. 
ARKANSAS: The 886,460 acres of

sold by each township, which 
then loaned the proceeds. ‘Lhe

Onto: The 704,488 acres of six-

acres of swamp lands, 24,216 
acres of salt-spring lands form 
asource of a fund upon which 
the State guarantees an inter- 
est of 6 per cent. The unsold 
lands of the sixteenth-section 
category produced, in 1895, 
$61,874 in the shape of rent. 
it appears that the sixteenth- section lands form a “*common- 
school fund,” and the salt- 
Pyeng landsa “general fund,’’ 
the first belongs to the 
township, while the second 
‘belongs to the people of Ohio 
in common.” (Law of March 2, 1881.) 
  The amount received, $286,751, 
was at first used generally. 
In 1842 the residue ($9,163) was made apartof the fund 
for public schools. 
The $2,007,000 was distributed to counties to be loaned to 
internalimprovement com- 
panies, and the interest up 
to 5 per cent was to go to 
schools. Finally the act of 
March 24, 1851, added the 
“palance of the surplus- revenue fund” to the “‘com- 
mon-school fund” (six- 
teenth-section lands). 
  This sum and about 17,500,- 000 acres of unsold school 
lands form the perreina fund, which in 1895 yielded $1,265,377. Thisinterest and 
such taxes as the State 
levies are the “available 
school fund,” to which the 
legislature may add 1 per 
cent or less of the ‘‘perma- 
nent school fund.” One- 
fourth of the occupation 
taxes is also added by the constitution to the fund for 
public schools. All money, stocks, bonds,

acres unsold, praca pe ae in

This fund was consolidated 
with the common-school fund 
in 1852, but was separated, as courts decided that the fund 
belonged particularly to the inhabitants of each Congr sional township (36 square 
miles). Inaddition to the six- 
teenth-section lands 1,252,708 
acres of swamp and 23,000 acres 
of salt lands have been re- 
ceived. The proceeds from 
the sale of these swamp and 
    “salt lands is given to the com- | 
mon-school fund. 
Inurnots: There were received 
as sixteenth-section land 985,-

which earns 4.93 per centinter- 
est. Three per cent of the 
roceeds of the sale of United 
States public lands in the State 
are also given, but one-sixth of this 8 per cent is set apart 
for higher education. Upon the proceeds of the 3 per cent 
given by the Federal Govern- ment the State pays6 per cent and is called the school fund. 
It is now $613,362. There are 
6,038 acres unsold schoollands, 
whose value has been included 
in sixteenth-section lands

MICHIGAN: There were re-

acres of swamp lands) 
amounted to $815,565 in 1892. 
The number of acres unsold 
is not known, but in 1876 there 
were 398,000 acres of six- 
teenth-section lands unsold 
held at $4 an acre. The salt 
lands that were given (25 out of 72 square miles) to the nor- 
mal-school fund so far have 
yielded $69,656. of 1836. 
The amount received was 
$860,254. Two-thirds was 
invested in internal im- 
provements and one-third putin stock of State bank. 
The former part is sup- posed to have been lost. 
The bank stock, on the 
other hand, ‘eventually doubled.” This would ap- 
pear to be about $560,000, which became a part of the 
“school fund” which is 
held by counties, and 
amounts to $7,521,226. 
There were received $818,592, of which $478,000 were in- 
vested in internal improve-

tax to maintain school after the expiration 
of the four months’ school required by consti- 
tution in order to continue school, The wording of the law is ‘‘police juries (ru- 
ral) and board of aldermen, etc., may levy;” 
but if these civil authorities fail to levy, the 
pects school board is directed to compel 
hem to Te it by mandamus. Supreme

  No city or town shall create a bonded debt 
exceeding 8 per cent of its assessed valua- ion. 
To construct buildings and procure sites incor- 
porated cities and towns may issue bonds, which shall not be to a greater amount than that a tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent, will pay 
current interest at 6 per cent,and “provide a sinking fund sufficient to pay principal at 
maturity.” 
By two-thirds yote districts may bond them- 
selves up to 5 per cent of their valuation, 
but must also provide for interest and a sinking fund to extinguish debt in twenty 
en at latest. hena majority of the electors of a district 
not a city district of the first class has voted taxes during a series of years for buildings 
and sites, the district board may anticipate 
the money to be thus raised by issuing bonds 
at 6 per cent or less. City districts of the first class may also issue bonds in the same 
ay save that the amount of bonds issued 
hall not exceed an aggregate tax of 2 mills 
for the next year.

The interest in psychological study and investigation discussed in 
the Commissioner’s previous reports shows no abatement. Universities 
are constantly increasing their equipment for experimental work in 
this field, observational study is extending among normal schools, and 
the circles for child study fostered by State and city superintendents 
are rapidly increasing. Efforts have been made from time to time to 
unify the independent groups of investigators, either by giving prom- 
inence to particular psychical elements, as sensations or feelings, or 
1 Prepared by Miss Anna Tolman Smith. 
671  
-P-A-G-E-752
  672 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
to particular activities, as imitation, imagination, or by question 
schemes that would enable scattered groups of observers to correlate 
their work. As the outcome of such efforts, large collections of 
observations have already been secured bearing upon a single psy- 
chical condition, impulse, or activity. Imitation in particular has 
proved a very attractive and fruitful subject. This faculty has 
excited attention from the time of Aristotle, but its treatment as a 
distinct psychological problem is of recent date, being closely con- 
nected with the scientific investigation of hypnotism. The marvelous 
play of suggestion and imitation in the control of motor impulses as 
manifested in the hypnotic subject at once brought imitation into view 
as a persistent and pervasive element in psychical action. Researches 
in the domain of animal instinct and intelligence have deepened 
interest in this faculty, which more than any other seems to imply 
the continuity of animal with human intelligence. 
As regards education, the important question suggested by these 
investigations is the extent to which volition is involved in imitation 
and its relation to ultimate freedom. As to the origin of imitation in 
the child, whether it is purely instinctive and reflexive or partly voli- 
tional, investigators differ widely. Thus Preyer asserts: ‘‘However 
often imitation has the appearance of an involuntary movement, yet 
when it was executed the first time it must have been executed with 
intention—i. e., voluntarily. When a child imitates, it has already 
awill. But the oftener a voluntary movement is repeated, always in 
the same way, so much the more it approximates reflex movement. 
Hence many imitative acts, even in the child, occur involuntarily 
quite early. But the first ones are willed.” 
Wundt, with equal positiveness, declares: ‘‘The continued imitation 
by which a child comes to learn the language that is spoken round it 
is impulsive, not voluntary.” 
It is not likely that these differences will ever cease, since the inter- 
pretation of the earliest imitative movements depends upon vague 
memories in the adult mind or the more uncertain interpretation of 
infantile states. It seems, however, to be generally agreed that voli- 
tion enters into imitative action at a very early period. Wundt rec- 
ognizes volition in the process of learning to walk, to talk, ete. ‘‘The 
child,” he says, ‘‘apperceives this combination of word and idea after 
it has been made intelligible to him with gestures, and associates it 
with his own imitative articulative movements. Following the pat- 
tern of these first apperceptions and associations, the child then forms 
others by imitating of his own accord more and more the words and 
verbal combinations that he accidentally hears adults using, and by 
making the appropriate associations with their meanings.” ! 
Compayré, who denies volition in the earliest imitative acts, says: 
“Tmitative movements, as soon as they become conscious movements, 
  
1 Outlines of Psychology (translation by Charles Hubbard Judd), pp. 292, 293,
-P-A-G-E-753
  PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 673 
pass under the control of the will. Then instinct disappears and indi- 
viduality begins.” * 
Baldwin, who, like Compayré, recognizes a gradual development 
from impulsive to voluntary imitation, agrees also with him in 
regarding conscious imitation as involving volition. At the moment 
the instinet to imitate becomes a matter of consciousness, then, to 
quote Professor Baldwin’s own words, ‘‘the mental copy, seen, heard, 
remembered, is set up and aimed at; imitation is no longer the organ- 
ism’s weapon; it is now the sword of the mind.”? 
Andagain: ‘In saying that volition—the clearly conscious phenom- 
enon of will—arises historically on the basis of persistent imitation, 
what I mean, is this, that the normal child’s first exhibition of voli- 
tion is found in its repeated efforts to imitate something.” * 
Bain regards all imitation as voluntary in itsnature. His utterance 
on this point is emphatic. ‘‘The voluntary command of the organs,” 
he says, ‘‘means the power of imitation or of performing actions in 
consequerice of seeing them performed.” * 
Froebel, who dwells ever on the self-activity of the child without 
analyzing its elements, recognizes that imitation and spontaneous 
activity are both manifested in the early plays of boyhood.® 
The school of physiological psychology, of which Ziehen may be 
taken as the representative, finds no ground for the ‘‘assumption of 
a special faculty of the will,” but emphasis is placed upon the relation 
between practice and the desired accommodations of the cortical mech- 
anism, characterized by Ziehen as ‘“‘an apparatus highly adaptable to 
the training of voluntary actions.” ° 
Whatever meaning be attached to volition, attention to a model and 
conscious effort to reproduce it involve voluntary effort; hence, and 
this is the point of great significance to teachers, up to a certain point 
imitation may be regarded as not only a means of quickening percep- 
tion, but also of strengthening the will. It is to be observed, further, 
that through the ever-increasing comprehension of relations, causes, 
and principles in the thing imitated there is gradual assent to free 
activity. This process is illustrated in the development of many of 
the chief artists of the world. 
The notion that imitation represses originality is not well grounded, 
on the contrary, it will generally be found, as Bain has pointed out, 
that ‘‘in whatever department any individual shows spontaneousand 
unprompted facility, in that department will the same individual be

imitative or acquisitive?”! It must, however, be recognized that 
repetition tends ultimately to make action mechanical, so that the 
limit of progress in a specific direction through mere imitation is soon 
reached. 
One of the important problems ever before a teacher is that of the 
exercise of the imitative impulse within the limits of its voluntary 
range. 
Nor should imitation be considered solely from the individual stand- 
point. It is essentially a sympathetic impulse. Says M. Compayré, 
“Sympathy must be included among the auxiliaries of imitation; 
sympathy taken in its double meaning, either as the faculty by which 
we participate in the pains and pleasures of others or as the inclina- 
tion which attracts two persons toward each other and inspires them 
with a mutual affection. In the former sense sympathy is in truth 
only imitation itself, a moral imitation, since it is merely the secret 
need of bringing our sentiments and our thoughts into accord with 
the thoughts and sentiment of others.” It follows that imitation is 
the means of social development, it is the faculty by which social edu- 
cation is made possible. This aspect of imitation was elaborated in 
astriking manner in a work by M. Tarde on The Laws of Imitation. 
In this work the author seeks to separate as completely as possible the 
purely social side of human actions from the vital or physical elements 
in them. He purposes to sketch a pure sociology, or rather general 
sociology. The laws of this sociology, as he conceives them, should 
be ‘‘equally applicable to all actual societies passed or possible as are 
the laws of general physiology to all animals living, extinet, or con- 
ceivable.” 
In the endeavor to find reasons which adequately explain the entire 
series of social events and which exclude any other possible sequence 
than that in which events actually occur, M. Tarde explores the whole 
field of human activity, language, religion, society, industry—he 
establishes analogies between movements here and those in the phys- 
ical domain and determines that social phenomena, like physical, 
repeat themselves with constant regularity. 
From the analysis he reaches the proposition that the social order 
develops from individual initiative throughimitation. ‘‘In the social 
order” he says ‘‘there is nothing but invention and imitation” (Tout 
west socialement qu’inventions et imitations). Whatever exaggera- 
tion may be detected in this exclusive proposition, the work of M. 
Tarde is of interest here because it seems to have prompted the inves- 
tigation proposed by Professor Royce in 1894, and popularized by an 
article in the Century Magazine (May, 1894). In this article, which 
discussed the whole subject in a light and discursive manner, Pro- 
fessor Royce submitted a schedule of questions intended to secure 
responses from the most varied sources.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 675 
The questions were not designed merely to accumulate examples of 
imitation. They included what are termed “original imitations;” 
that is, instances where the chosen model or elements serve as a 
medium for the expression of the inner self. Such are the dramatic 
impersonations or ‘‘systematic mimicry” in which many children 
indulge. Imitative naughtiness was also specified as a field for 
investigation and early manifestations of ‘‘sympathetic emotions,” 
which enter so largely into the moods of the masses. 
Also as a means of completing the study of imitation, Professor 
Royce asked for accounts of the reverse function, the willful ten- 
dency that causes certain children to react against all models. These 
inquiries indicate that imitation has a deeper significance for Pro- 
fessor Royce than mere repetition, upon which M. Tarde places chief 
stress. Professor Baldwin, in an earlier article,’ had considered the 
genetic development of imitation from the organic to the voluntary 
stage. Incidentally he showed, also, defects in M. Tarde’s theory, 
especially its failure to recognize choice and judgment as to a model 
consciously followed. 
Although others were working at the same problem, it was in par- 
ticular the articles by Professor Royce and Professor Baldwin that 
made imitation the chief subject of interest in school circles, and the 
result has been a copious and varied literature of more or less interest 
to teachers. The committee on psychological inquiry of the national 
eouncil took up the subject of imitation as related to the process of 
learning. Their report will be found in full in this chapter. 
Professor Baldwin’s Mental Development in the Child and the 
Race, published in 1895, elaborated the author’s own conception of 
imitation, tracing its relation to the whole process of mental growth. 
Amid much that is conjectural, admittedly so, in the theory advanced, 
the work abounds in suggestions stimulating to the teacher. A pre- 
liminary report on imitation was made by Professor Royce before the 
meeting of the American Psychological Association December, 1894, 
and published subsequently in the Psychological Review (May, 1895). 
The report was especially characterized by the effort to classify and 
define the several processes which are commonly recognized by 
psychologists as imitative, and it was extremely happy in its exposi- 
tion of the subjective phase of the process. A portion of the article 
bearing on this view is cited below. 
Among the records of observations or accumulated examples of 
imitative arts, two should be noticed particularly; the first, entitled, 
“The suggestibility of children,” by Maurice H. Small, fellow of 
Clark University; published in the Pedagogical Seminary of Decem- 
ber, 1896. The study related to the effects of suggestion rather than 
to imitation, but as imitation is the most constant outcome of sug- 
gestion, the record naturally turned upon this activity.   
1 Mind, January, 1894.

  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. “ 
It is of special interest to note that this record was made possible 
through the cooperation of superintendents and teachers in many 
States, who responded to the syllabus sent out from Clark University. 
The collection is intended to illustrate the influence of suggestion 
upon motor impulses, but as might have been expected from the con- 
ditions under which the data were collected, the relation between the 
main trend of the discussion and the particular instances is often 
vague or forced. Mr. Small hints at a method of instruction and dis- 
cipline by suggestion without explicit characterization. The experi- 
enced reader will recognize that it is an influence ever present in 
school life, but not easily defined or regulated. 
The volume of child observations, first series, Imitation and Allied 
Activities, edited by Miss Ellen M. Haskell, of the State Normal School 
at Worcester, comprises observations made by the students of that 
institution. The principal, Mr. E. A. Russell, furnishes an introduc- 
tion which sets forth very distinctly the purpose, the limitations, and 
the advantages of this particular kind of child study. Copious 
extracts are cited in this chapter from Mr. Russell’s introduction to 
meet inquiries upon these several points which are widely discussed 
in normal schools at the present time. 
This survey, though confined to a single line of inquiry, may serve 
to indicate the trend and method of observational psychology as fos- 
tered at many centers in this country, and the efforts to correlate these 
observations with the more exact investigations of specialists. The 
actual value of such observations in extending our knowledge of psy- 
chical life appears as yet somewhat problematical, but there is abun- 
dant testimony to its admirable effects in kindling sympathy for child- 
hood, and thus increasing the personal influence of teachers in guiding 
and developing their pupils. 
The opinion expressed by Professor Burnham, of Clark University, 
is constantly reiterated by other leaders of child study. ‘‘It is,” he 
says, ‘“‘primarily for the teacher, secondarily for the children, inci- 
dentally for science.”

through a study of the imitative functions in childhood with a view 
to explain mental development and the process of learning. 
The felicity of this selection of imitation as the opening study in 
the psychology of education will appear upon consideration. For 
imitation, in its purest and simplest form, that of mechanical repeti- 
tion of the actions of another person is, by common consent, placed 
~at the bottom of spiritual achievements. A monkey or a parrot can 
mimic actions or speech, and to call the action of a human being 
parrot-like repetition or a process of aping is to express reproach 
and contempt for it. What teacher is there that does not despise 
mere verbal repetition in his pupils? Can there be a greater paradox 
in educational psychology than the theory which sets out with the 
function of imitation, and attempts to show that all forms of intel- 
lectual and moral activity are only varieties of this despised mode 
of action? If there is an attractive method of bringing psychology 
to the attention of teachers surely it has now been found. The sheer 
audacity of the theory that places the stone which the teachers had 
rejected for the head of the corner will fix the attention alike of the 
primary school mistress and the professor in college. 
But there is a consideration connected with imitative action which 
makes it the most fruitful approach to psychology, for it explains the 
mode in which the individual man unites with his fellow-men to form 
a social whole. It introduces us to the formation of institutions, the 
family, civil community, the State, the church—those greater selves 
which reinforce the little selves of isolated individuals. For the 
study of imitation leads to the discovery of the modes by which the 
individual man repeats for himself the thinking and doing and feel- 
ing of his fellows, and thus enriches his own life by adding to it the 
lives of others. Thus his own life becomes vicarious for others, and 
he participates vicariously in the life of society. 
‘What are manners and customs but imitated forms of doing, that 
preserve the results of successful experience in dealing with nature 
or in cooperating with one’s fellows? What is fashion, with its appar- 
ently capricious changes, but the method of emancipating individuals 
from the tyranny of old customs and usages, that insist on minute 
punctilios in matters that are unimportant, except as symbols of our 
membership in the social whole? Thus one kind of imitation sup- 
plants another as more progressive. The fashions of the semicivilized 
and savage people last without change from generation to genera- 
tion—and, indeed, it is likely for hundreds, and even for thousands, 
of years—because the savage intellect can not as yet attain the 
strength to discriminate between moral and indifferent actions. The 
savage has only two kinds of deeds—moral and immoral; while the 
civilized man has three kinds—moral, immoral, and unmoral. Thus 
that form of imitation which we all despise as mere fashion has sig-

nificance as the means of emancipating us from that heavy yoke of 
ceremonial that once prescribed the forms of our indifferent actions 
as though they were of moral or religious import. 
Imitation develops, on the one hand, into habits, or customs and 
morals, and this is the will-side of human mind; and, on the other 
hand, it develops into perception, memory, ideas, and insights, this 
being the intellectual side of mind. It is evident that the pedagogic 
interest in psychology is the evolution of the higher faculties out of 
the lower. It is all-important for us to understand this progressive 
step by which free moral action develops in the place of mere uncon- 
scious use and wont. We must discover how mere external memory 
of borrowed ideas gives place to insight. It is necessary, first of all, 
to discover the most elementary forms of imitation. In this research 
the students of physical phenomena have greatly aided. The dis- 
covery of the fact that a small per cent of people are so sensitive to 
the mental influences about them that they can, without the interme- 
diation of words, read the thoughts of others has been made and veri- 
fied in numerous instances. The study of hypnotism has taken up 
this fact into a class of related facts belonging not only to the intel- 
lect but to the will and the emotions as well. The phrase ‘‘ hypnotic 
suggestion” has come to play a great role in elucidating the rudi- 
mentary facts of imitation. The hypnotizer suggests an idea, which 
the hypnotic subject takes up and carries out in feeling or action. 
The rapid progress of scientific investigation in this field of psychic 
research promises to throw light on all social thought, feeling, and 
action. It will help us to understand much that has been obscure in 
the rise and spread of popular beliefs, the genesis of social tornadoes, 
like the Crusades, the French Revolution, the Tartaric invasions of 
Europe, or even such local affairs as strikes and mobs. 
We must not lose sight of the essential fact that shows itself even 
in the most rudimentary of the phenomena of imitation. There-can 
be no imitation whatever except on the part of self-active beings; in 
other words, only souls can imitate. ‘‘ Imitation,” says Compayré, 
“ig the reproduction of what one has seen another do.” It is there- 
fore always to some extent an act of assimilation. Even if we extend 
the meaning of imitation so as to include unconscious mimicry and 
all phenomena akin to hypnotic suggestion, still it is self-activity 
that does the imitating. What is beheld as an act of another is con- 
verted by adoption into an act of self. The pride and pleasure that 
the infant exhibits on the occasion of his first conscious imitation has 
its root in this, that he has made something his own, has proved 
himself equal to imitating a movement in himself by his will; he has 
revealed his selfhood to some extent. This is the significance of 
play, which is chiefly imitation, that the undeveloped human being 
is learning to know himself by seeing what he can do. He is reveal-

  PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 679 
ing himself to others and to himself, and getting strength in his 
individuality. 
Thus we see that there is an element of originality in the most 
mechanical phase of imitation. The self is active and assimilative. 
It sees an external deed, which it proceeds to make its own deed by 
imitation. 
It proves itself to possess a human nature identical with the one 
whom it imitates. 
Originality grows by progressive deepening of the insight into 
causes and motives of the thing imitated. The lowest stage of imita- 
tion superstitiously imitates all the details, because it has no insight 
into the grounds and purposes of the action imitated and but little 
comprehension of the means employed. When it understands the 
means and the motives, it strikes out for itself and makes new adap- 
tations. It modifies its imitation to suit differences of circumstances. 
Originality grows with this ascending comprehension of means and 
purposes. There comes a time when the imitative child comprehends 
the principle as well as does the master whom he imitates, and then 
he is emancipated from all imitation in this part of his education. 
If he keeps on and comprehends the genesis of the principle from 
deeper principles, he emancipates himself from even the ‘ hypnotic 
suggestion” of the principle itself, and all external authority has 
become inward freedom. 
M. Tarde, who published his great book on the Laws of Imitation 
in 1890, speaks of self-imitation, as in the case of habit (p. 83), which 
he defines as a sort of ‘unconscious imitation of one’s self by one’s 
self.” Here, in the stages of originality, where the person has learned 
to comprehend what he once imitated, and now understands it in its 
causes and in the reasons for its existence, is self-imitation, if we are 
to speak of imitation at all. It is no longer an activity at an outward 
suggestion, but purely spontaneous. It has vanquished the external 
object by ascending to its causes. 
It is worthy of note that this book of M. Tarde is a study of sociol- 
ogy; for, in the French Revolution, the thought of Rousseau pro- 
duced individualism, and the social whole was denied a valid exist- 
ence in the shape of the State, except in so far as it appeared as a 
free contract between individuals. It was not considered that any 
contract presupposes a preexistence of state or government, a social 
whole to give validity to the contract. It is well that this new move- 
ment in psychology, which proves the substantial basis of mental 
evolution to lie in social institutions, should receive its great impulse 
froma Frenchman. M. Tarde is the anti-Rousseau. 
The profoundest thinker of the human race, Aristotle, hits upon 
this subject of imitation in his Poetics, making it the basis of his 
philosophy of art. What he says in the fourth and ninth chapters of 
 
-P-A-G-E-760
Se eee 
680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the book on the subject of Mimesis, or imitation, rather leads us to 
see a deeper meaning in the word than mimicry or mechanical repeti- 
tion. It seems almost to mean symbol making. ‘‘Man is the most 
imitative of animals, and makes his first steps in learning by aid of 
imitation,” he tells us. Man is a symbol-making animal always, in 
whatever he does; making a symbol of what he is in his essential 
nature; always repeating in himself the symbols of the existence and 
actions of all other beings. 
Leibnitz, the philosopher who translated Aristotle’s ideas for modern 
readers, has told us in his monadology that each soul is a monad 
which, by its self-activity, repeats for itself or represents the whole 
universe. This is imitation on a grand scale—imitation transfigured, 
we might say—that, by self-activity, assimilates the whole universe. 
The monad creates for itself the world that it perceives. Here, we 
see, is the harmony of freedom and authority. The soul is not deter- 
mined by what lies outside it, but determines itself so as to reproduce 
the beings and the causes that are outside it. 
Here, too, is the social man again of M. Tarde; for each man has 
this one destiny, to sum up in himself the life and deeds of the race. 
The latest great world poet, Goethe, in his Wilhelm Meister, treats 
the problem of culture or education, in its widest sense, in connection 
and contrast with the problem of dramatic art—how to make an actor. 
The individual sees ideals above him, and impersonates them; loves 
them, and imitates them; wears them as a player acts his part. Grad- 
ually he acquires as a second nature his ideals, and must keep growing 
on into new and higher ideals. The mere actor (he shows) must be 
able to assume quickly all characters, and yet possess no character 
himself; he must be a sort of professional wig block to hold, one after 
another, all kinds of wigs, but to have not even a scalp of its own. 
Goethe’s favorite characters were those who react against their envi- 
ronments by internal development. They always press beyond imita- 
tion toward the indwelling principle of that which is imitated, and 
thus attain freedom. Prof. Mark Baldwin, now of Princeton Univer- 
sity, was one of the first to take up and develop this function of imita- 
tion as the key to educational psychology. -His articles in Science, in 
1891 and 1892, and more recent articles in Mind, 1894, and, finally, his 
work on Mental Evolution in the Child and the Race, form a large and 
valuable contribution to this study. 
Prof. Josiah Royce, of Harvard, has taken up the same theme, and 
with the extensive resources at his command has presented it in more 
suggestive and more popular forms than had been done before. Those 
who have read his charming article in the May number of the Century 
on ‘The imitative functions and their place in human nature” need 
not be told so much as this. 
Your committee in this their report have not attempted to illus- 
trate the application of this important category of imitation to the

subject of the process of learning in childhood, but have preferred to 
leave this illustration for the round table discussion of Monday even- 
ing, in which Professor Royce has consented to assist and give his own 
presentations of one of the phases of this theme.

EXTRACTS FROM A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON IMITATION, BY PROF. 
J. ROYCE.' 
Imitation of motor functions.—‘‘To us all the word imitation first 
suggests motor functions, such as those of the child that struts about 
as a soldier, or that runs on all fours as a dog, or that learns to talk. 
Such functions are very numerous. We observe them in many ani- 
mals, including birds. Their characteristic is that the imitator is 
more or less clearly aware of a model, and finds his own body more or 
less able to repeat certain usually extensive and complex movements 
of this model. This repetition gives satisfaction to the imitator. 
Initation of this sort is to be roughly classified as either more or less 
critical. Sometimes the imitator is content with the roughest repro- 
duction. Sometimes he is cautious, and is watchfully anxious to do 
precisely as his model does. A mocking bird, as I at one period often 
observed in the case of a household pet, appears to study, with very 
great care, at least some of the series of notes that he reproduces. 
Some children far surpass others in an early pedantry about the enun- 
ciation and use of their words. In any case, meanwhile, the subjec- 
tive experiences of the imitator are here, at best, only in part identical 
with those given him in the stimulus presented to his senses by his 
model. He hears sounds and replies by sounds, but of course he feels 
more or less the muscular and other organic disturbances incident to 
the reproduction. He sees the movements of his model. He both 
sees and feels his own imitative movements, and in all this he feels 
the latter as his own. In consequence, the imitator usually takes 
what is often called a decidedly subjective sort of interest in his 
power to imitate. His activity has thus two strongly contrasted 
aspects. He watches his model, so far as he watches it at all, with a 
highly objective faithfulness. So far, his imitation depends upon a 
theoretical and very self-surrendering sort of outward scrutiny. 
“On the other hand, he delights in his own imitative powers as his

own, i. e., as corporeally interesting events in his own organism, just 
as even the mocking bird very obviously does. On this side the 
activity is, in the popular sense of the word, as self-centered as is 
eating or catching prey. That is, it is an activity whose conscious 
aspect involves an interest in interorganic experiences. And, on this 
side too, the imitative process in our children is a great meeting 
place about which all sorts of self-considerate and self-conscious 
interests gather. Thus one sees how highly interorganic, or sub- 
jective, as well as how highly outward-looking objective, the imitative 
consciousness in the present class of cases has to be. Hence the 
enormous fecundity and various outcome of such imitative interest. 
Vanity and conscience, ideal devotion and flippant mockery, tame 
subserviency and the loftiest originality—all these tendencies alike 
may, and in fact normally do, take root in this fruitful soil, and any 
of them may grow into the child’s later character, and all because he 
was, in the first place, disposed to repeat the complex motor processes 
of his models, and so was forced to set off his consciousness of his 
own movements against his perception of the movements of others, 
thus emphasizing both his ideas of himself and his ideas of his 
models, each set of ideas by contrast with the other set. Imitation 
may thus become, to use the words again in their purely popular 
sense, the most self-abnegating or the most self-considerate of tenden- 
cies, according as, in the end, one or the other of these opposing drifts 
of attention gets emphasized, i. e., according as one comes to consider 
rather his own imitative organism or the outside model.” 
Imitation of intelligent functions.—‘‘ So much for a first and most 
familiar class of processes defined as imitative. But we, all of us, 
extend the word imitation to include those intelligent functions which 
tend to the voluntary production of external objects resembling cer- 
tain other objects called the models of the objects produced. Thus 
drawing, painting, modeling, building, mechanical skill of all sorts, 
are universally named imitative functions. In our own cases such 
functions, as a class, are obviously almost altogether derived, directly 
or indirectly, from the functions of the former class just character- 
‘ized. We learn, namely, to reproduce things, in whole or in part, by 
first having learned to imitate people. Mechanical skill may early 
become self-directing. But it is probably always, at the start, socially 
guided. Psychological complications are, accordingly, here of much 
the sort as in the foregoing class of cases. Our imitations of objects 
involve vast numbers of relatively controllable conscious processes 
besides our perception of the finished products which resemble the 
stimulating models. And here, too, in consequence, both our rela- 
tively objective or outward-looking, and our relatively subjective or 
inward-looking interests get a correlative development as we learn to 
imitate a development which may have the utmost complexity and 
the most momentous psychological consequences. On the whole,
-P-A-G-E-763

PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 683 
however, the imitation of things generally tends, as they say, to send 
us out of ourselves, i. e., outside of our interest in the processes of 
our own organisms, still more than does the imitation of the mere acts 
of people. Our imitative deed is transient; but, when we make some- 
thing by the deed, its product here remains to calm our more anxious 
or our vainer interest in our own motor processes as such. Hence it 
is that musicians are more subjective in mood than are architects; 
and it is easier to be vain about matters of social etiquette than about 
one’s skill as a carpenter, in case one has any such skill; while, to 
pass to another case where imitation is complicated with originality, 
nobody can judge his own book while it is in press as he can after it 
is in cold print and binding before him.” 
General nature of imitation.—“ Now I have laid stress upon the fac- 
tors present in these two classes of cases of imitation, because I have 
meant to use them to illustrate the general nature of imitation itself. 
In these two classes of cases imitation is not merely, as a psychological 
process, the reproduction of a series of sense stimulations, or of exter- 
nal perceptions by means of a seriesof motor processes; but itis some- 
thing still more complex. Itis not only a process by which we repro- 
duce one set of data by means of another set of data like the first, but 
it is also a process by which we get two sets of data whose inevitable 
contrasts are as interesting and as instructive to us as their purposed 
resemblances. We get an interpretation of the perceived model 
through the imitation of it. On the other hand, to say that imitation 
in these cases is an act whose main motive is to interpret my percep- 
tions by means of my deeds, is indeed true; but, of course, so far the 
same might be said of all those acts, such as looking, listening, 
approaching an object, grasping, touching, handling, exploring in the 
perceptive field—of all acts, in short, which involve intellectually val- 
uable motor processes. What, then, is the characteristic"feature of 
the imitative acts in the mentioned classes of cases? Does it not 
obviously lie in the fact that my interpretation of what I am usually 
said to perceive outside of my organism in the external world, is in 
the case of these classes of imitations, conditioned upon my setting 
over against my perceptions a series of motor processes, or of perceived 
results of motor processes, which in its wholeness contrasts with the 
other series in the one principal fact that the motor processes, the 
imitative deeds or their results, appear to me relatively controllable, 
plastic, reproducible at will, while otherwise the two series are largely 
similar. 
““When I learn to grasp an apple, the grasping is, indeed, once 
learned, an easily reproducible and so controllable deed, and on sug- f 
gestion isremembered as such. But when I learn to say apple, upon 
hearing the word pronounced, the act, once in my power, is felt as con- 
trollable, but as to result it resembles its model (namely, the word 
apple, pronounced by my neighbor)—something that concerns not its

684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
controllableness, but some of its other characters. Thus in these cases 
imitation is definable, from the psychological side, as an act that 
interprets an uncontrollable perceptive series by setting over against 
it a series of experiences that appear to be similar to it in content, 
but to be also in contrast with it by virtue of their controllableness. 
Or, again, an imitation is an act that tends to the interpretation of 
what is beyond my power, or is independent of my movements, by 
contrasting it with what otherwise resembles it, but is in my power 
and is a result of my movements. This feature of imitation, viz, 
that it accomplishes the aim of throwing light on the uncontrollable 
percept. by setting the controllable deed beside it, is, I suppose, the 
principal intellectual function of the higher imitative life.” 
Idealization of imitations.—‘‘ This principle of the tendency to delib- 
erate idealization of our imitations, to deliberate deviations from the 
literal, one finds, then, in the most varied forms, in play, in art, in 
the far-reaching and deep-seated tendency, very complex in its origin, 
to translate space relations into time relations, and vice versa, in every 
form of fondness for what one may call symbolical motor processes; 
and so, finally, with very momentous consequences, in all those motor 
processes that are connected with the growth of our theoretical think- 
ing. That our thoughts are in this general sense conscious processes 
by which we constantly.mean to imitate the tenet of the things that 
we experience, is perfectly obvious. Equally obvious is the fact that 
to think experience is to translate it into terms which are decidedly 
foreign to its character as it comes to us, apart from such ideal recon- 
struction, and in its first intention. Now, thinking accompanies 
motor processes, abbreviated and truncated and rendered abstract in 
all sorts of ways, but very obviously and highly imitative in all the 
cases where we get them in any relatively unabridged form. 
“The gesture languageisa casein point. It givesthe gesturer trains 
of experience of a very complex character, which are in a summary 
and more or less symbolic fashion similar to the primary trains of 
experience which by his gestures he undertakes to describe. For 
gestures we who speak have now learned to substitute trains of words, 
which we follow with an endless chain of attentive processes shifting 
from one series of images to another. But the series of attentive proc- 
esses, as it follows now these, now those images, gives us a total inner 
experience which we call an account of the experienced reality beyond 
the thinking process. The value of this account we judge by itsresem- 
blance, not in detail, but in its total network of related elements to 
those aspects of the relatively external experience which our thinking 
) means to emphasize. And yet, on the other hand, how unlike their 
originals our abstract ideas mean to be. How far is the thinker’s 
imitation from being a mere inner reproduction of the external 
experience about which he thinks? It is the very contrast which 
here enlightens us, when it is accompanied by a consciousness of the    
-P-A-G-E-765
  PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 685 
sort of agreement which we all the time intend. In symbolic imita- 
tion the imitative subject means to neglect all of his model except his 
own chosen aspect of it; and even this aspect he generally means to 
reproduce in terms of a sort of inner experience which differs from it 
as widely as the data of one sense * * * can differ from those of 
another.” 
Imitation psychologically defined.—‘‘ Imitation and model are con- 
trasted series of presentations whose relation keeps them apart. And 
hence it is that, as I myself suppose, imitation is, psychologically 
speaking, the one source of our whole series of conscious distinctions 
between subject and object, thought and truth, deed and ideal, 
impulse and conscience, inner world and external world—in short, of 
all those familiar and fundamental rational distinctions which psy- 
chology has hitherto found so baffling. The contrast between model 
and imitation is, tomy mind, the first appearance in consciousness of 
that differentiation which in the end makes internal and external 
experience not merely qualitatively different—as, of course, they 
more or less are from the first—but consciously discriminated, as at 
first they seem not to be.” 
EXTRACTS FROM INTRODUCTION TO CHILD OBSERVATIONS, STATE

Mr. E. H. Russe, Principal. 
Aim of the observations.—‘‘ The main object in making and record- 
ing the observations that constitute the present volume has been to 
put our students who are preparing to be teachers en rapport with 
children.” 
* * * * * * * 
““The aim has been not a scientific study of children in the interest 
of psychology, but an attempt to bring our future teachers into closer 
and more sympathetic relations with them as individuals. In this 
respect the undertaking has proved highly successful, and it pretends 
to nothing more.” 
* * * * * * * 
““ Wholly new discoveries in the domain of child nature are scarcely 
to be looked for; but rather a more careful exploration, fresh points 
of view, better insight, juster emphasis, something like a new read- 
ing of an old and familiar book. Our own observers have been 
especially encouraged to seek for the naive and spontaneous activities 
of children, rather than for what is exceptional or responsive to sug- 
gestions from parents and teachers. The conditions most favorable 
for this kind of observation are perfect freedom and unconstraint on 
the part of the child, and, if possible, complete unconsciousness of 
being the object of special interest or attention. This, of course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-766

requires much tact and self-effacement in the observer; but I think 
the following pages will show that such tact has not been wanting.” 
“Tt has seemed to me of prime importance to keep the motives and 
direction of this study of children right end foremost; that is, not to 
forget that we want to know children in order to enter into fuller 
sympathy with them, not to let the knowing, however scientific, stand 
as the sole end in view—save in the case of a very small number of 
devotees of science for its own sake, and even here I should be very 
particular about requiring such to show their credentials. I deem it 
better not to urge young teachers to assume the scientific role, to 
think that nothing short of this or other than this is of any dignity 
or avail.” 
* * * * * * * 
“Tt has been objected that the value of these contributions is viti- 
ated by their fragmentary and detached character; and it has been 
suggested how vastly more conclusive and satisfactory they would be 
if accompanied by such particulars of time, place, and cireumstance 
as would give them an ampler background and perspective. Per- 
haps so. But we encounter two main difficulties here. First, the 
ancestry, environment, and personal history of any child, in such 
degree of minuteness and accuracy as could be of real service, are 
matters by no means easy to come at. And again, if such details 
were put before us, it would be found exceedingly difficult to trace 
their influence upon the case in hand. The river of childhood does 
indeed run by our very doors, but the springs that feed it are mostly 
beyond our horizon. We can not begin at its sources, because we do 
not yet know them. ‘They are precisely what we are trying to dis- 
cover; and our only way is to note in which direction the current 
flows, and then follow it upward as best we can. In sucha study as 
this a vast body of facts must be accumulated before their connec- 
tions and dependencies can be made apparent; and these facts will 
often be like the arrow points and potsherds which the archeologist 
treasures up, until at length by their variety and numbers they flash 
into relations and unities which singly they could give no hint of. 
All work in inductive science must be superficial before it can be 
deep. Wecan never take the second step first. But further than 
this, it is not clear that, in the great majority of cases, a given child- 
ish act would receive much, if any, illumination from such particu- 
lars of the child’s surroundings as would be accessible to an ordinary 
observer; forexample, the age, nationality, and occupation of parents 
and grandparents, number and ages of brothers and sisters, outline 
sketches of nurses, playmates, and other companions, social and 
pecuniary status of the family, location of the home, personal history 
of the child from birth, ete. In children presenting marked abnor- 
mal peculiarities (not more than 1 or 2 per cent of the whole), such

facts might indeed have important significance to a medical man; 
but that would mean a wholly different kind of investigation, and one 
obviously not within the purview of the present study. The influ- 
ence of heredity and environment, especially the former, is by no 
means as yet so fully made out and understood, even by specialists, 
that its application as a factor in every case can be readily perceived, 
and made serviceable. If any reader will take the trouble to look at 
a dozen of the records that follow, taken at random, and then ask 
himself the question just how and in what respects they would be 
rendered clearer and more conclusive by any use he could make of 
such personal details as have been enumerated, I should be glad to 
hear his answer. No one doubts, in general, that such facts do have 
some bearing on each particular case; but it is quite another matter 
to say definitely what that bearing is, and how it is to be traced and 
its connections shown. 
“T suspect that the state of our knowledge is not sufficiently ad- 
vanced for this, and will not be for a long time to come. Nor has the 
thing been attempted, except in a very loose and sketchy way, even by 
those who have given us the most minute and systematic accounts of 
individual children—as Preyer, Darwin, Tiedemann, Miss Shinn, or 
any other, so far as Tam aware; least of all, perhaps, by Professor Sully, 
in his Extracts from a Father’s Diary, who yet deplores its absence 
from the Worcester records—of which, nevertheless, he does not fail 
to make good use in his latest volume. It seems, therefore, a super- 
ficial, if not captious, demand to ask that these records of ours should 
be loaded with a marginal accompaniment of facts (even if they could 
be had) that nobody has hitherto found it feasible or thought it worth 
while to give, and which, if furnished, could not be to any useful 
extent interpreted or applied. To hold a child, ‘root and all,’ in your 
hand, to transplant to your notebook even its smallest act with all 
the rootlets and soil, racial and individual, adhering intact, is a feat 
of far greater difficulty and delicacy than is implied by the easy remark 
that we ‘ought to have more’ of the circumstances, associations, ete., 
in order to form a satisfactory judgment. I think we need to know 
much more of what there is in children before we are ready to attack 
the questions, how much there is, and how it came there.”

Reflections upon the observations.—‘“‘ The thing that has struck me 
most forcibly in my delighted perusal of these records is the spirited 
way in which the imitative acts of children are carried on—the unflag- 
ging repetitions of the same simple things, and the ready support and 
transfiguration that fancy lends to barren details and materials, cre- 
ating from moment to moment fresh interest and variety. It has 
seemed asif I were privileged to stand at the fountain head of life 
and see its waters bubble forth from exhaustless hidden depths as 
by perpetual miracle.

“Next to this buoyancy of spirit, as a source of interest, comes, per- 
haps, the suprising accuracy of children’s earliest imitations. How 
unerringly the little actors seize upon the very ‘pith and marrow’ 
of much that goes on in the new world around them, and with what 
a sure and even artistic touch they often reproduce it and give it the 
right emphasis in their play. The abounding fancy which they dis- 
play is not fancy merely, but is at the same time well anchored to 
truth, and shows a grasp of the act imitated, in its essence and mean- 
ing, that is remarkable in being so much beyond the child’s power of 
description and speech at that age. There is thus a language of 
things and events that speaks to the child, and is understood by him, 
and intelligently responded to by his imitative acts, long before he is 
able to comprehend and use conventional speech. Here is an avenue 
and vehicle of acquisition and expression that antedate even the 
mother tongue. And this fact, by the way, suggests the question 
whether our school-teaching does not too soon turn away from this 
natural and universal language, in which the child shows himself 
such an adept, and unwisely attempt to replace it with arbitrary 
and artificial word signs, a later and more complex acquirement, both 
in the race and the individual, and one for which the infant’s powers 
are not yet ripe? Whether there is not at this age a considerable 
tract of time wherein, by a simple method of example and imitation, 
and mostly in silence, a child might be taught many things more 
effectively, with less strain and confusion of mind, than under condi- 
tions which involve the usual accompaniment of pedagogical verbi- 
age? In a word, since children are on the alert for things to do 
months and years before they have any ear for wordy explanations, 
could not their first teachers borrow with advantage something from 
the art of those who instruct the deaf? 
“Again, the expansive and progressive character of play from year 
to year is noticeable and suggestive. It begins impulsively with 
salient and detached acts— 
‘Some fragment from his dream of human life’-— 
and only by slow accretions comes to embrace accessories and rela- 
tions. Thus the observer is often able to seize and record, in the 
simplest imitative effort, practically its whole scope and meaning. 
There is no motive but impulse, and there are no traceable connec- 
tions; the curtain falls and the scene is at an end. Then— 
‘The little actor cons another part,’ 
which in its turn may be similarly recorded. So it happens that these 
records, by what at first. seems their too fragmentary and disconnected 
form, really afford a true representation of a pronounced trait of 
early childhood, namely, the jerky, staccato movement of its activi- 
ties. The development of a child’s intelligence, like the ossification 
 
-P-A-G-E-769
  PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 689 
of its bones, appears to begin at isolated points and to spread gradu- 
~ ally until contact and continuity are slowly established.” 
* * * * * * * 
“The child is an apprentice. The art and mystery of life lie before 
him, no longer primitive and simple as in prehistoric ages, but devel- 
oped and expanded into the thousand forms, usages, and institutions 
of modern civilization. These it is his task to learn and practice. 
And it is to this long and arduous undertaking that the infant, hap- 
pily unmindful of its magnitude, applies himself betimes and with 
joyful and indomitable alacrity. He attacks the problem, as we have 
said, first, by resolute and manifold activity, beginning with the reflex 
and instinctive, which gradually merge into the purposive; secondly, 
by imitation and mimicry, also impulsive and fitful at first, and 
finally, as reenforcements of intelligence arrive, by more expanded 
and systematic games and sports, which eventually carry him to the 
threshold of maturity. This, in rough outline, is the sketch and plan 
of his procedure, which, indeed, is but a conforming to the necessities 
of his situation. The serious work of life is far beyond the powers 
and ken of a child. In physical ability and in understanding he 
must long remain a weakling and dependent. But he inherits a 
patrimony of instincts, and though he seems at first to squander this 
in many prodigal and aimless undertakings, he is thereby continually 
gaining valuable experience. He casts about for an opening into the 
attractive activities that he sees going on in the adult world around 
him, and, reckoning perforce with his immaturity and impuissance, 
straightway adopts, as the only profession possible to his small execu- 
tive powers, the drama. The long-past achievements of his ancestors 
reverberate and tingle in his blood, impelling him to action; but all 
his efforts are ludicrously futile beside those of the giants about him 
and meet only with indifference or jeers. The world of law and order 
and systematic endeavor is too tough for his assimilation. It must 
first be softened into myth and make-believe by the solvent juices of 
fancy, which the glands of his little mind fortunately pour out in 
abundance. He can not live life; he must dramatize and play it. So 
he becomes an actor, an amateur in the good sense— 
‘ Filling from time to time his ‘‘ humorous stage” 
With all the ‘‘ persons,” down to palsied age, 
That Life brings with her in her equipage.’ 
Thus in imitative play, in obedience to the biologic law of recapit- 
ulation, the child epitomizes and rehearses the fundamental experi- 
ences of the race at the same time that he is sounding the depths and 
shoals of his own nascent powers, and thereby preparing day by day 
to take part in the real work of life which the coming years will 
bring. Play is thus seen to be at once reminiscent and anticipatory, 
a welding of the future to the past. This is the child’s season of

-apprenticeship, his Wanderjahre; it comes but once; nor is it easy to 
see how it could be essentially narrowed or abridged without entail- 
ing serious loss of that vital continuity and momentum which is the 
mainspring of human character and achievement. The welfare, not 
only of the individual, but of the race, demands the widest sweep and 
fullest play of this deeply rooted instinct, and any ideal or regimen 
of education that proposes or tends in the least degree to cut it short 
by meddlesome repression or substitution is little less than a crime 
against the race. 
“A striking thing about the imitative play of children, as revealed 
on almost every page of the following records, is the way in which it 
is made to minister to what may be called the instinct or passion of 
self-exaltation, the restless and impatient craving of childhood to get 
beyond and above itself, to leap into the future, and assume the dress 
and ways of grown people. The actual status of the child, as I have 
said, is weakness and insignificance itself, and his real advancement 
is snail slow. But by laying hold, through imitation, of the adult 
activities around him, he seems to pull himself wp where he yearns to 
be, becomes of consequence, at least in his own eyes, is ‘ transported 
beyond this ignorant present, and feels now the future in the instant.’ 
The leverage thus gained is of signal advantage to the child, both as 
a source of present enjoyment and as supplying the needed spring 
and impetus to further improvement. Where this propensity is lack- 
ing, as usually in the case of the idiotic, there is no motive, and all 
progress is at a standstill. And it may be remarked, in passing, that 
school life, so far as it operates to check and restrict this spirit of imi- 
tation and play, annuls the most powerful of childish motives, and 
tends to reduce the pupil fora time to a stagnant and semiidiotic 
condition. The sway of the self-exalting disposition, though in gen- 
eral so salutary, does sometimes play into the hands of precocious 
development, and may, if taken seriously and seconded by parents 
and teachers, become one of the gravest of dangers, for it marks a 
tendency to revert to a lower and shorter cycle of growth. The sun 
should not go down upon any pronounced symptom of precocity in 
your child; let this be checked betimes, not by rebuke, but by the 
starving process of turning your back upon it.” 
* * * eo %* * ca 
“We say, from the adult point of view, that little children are 
quick to see resemblances, and we ascribe this to their acuteness, but 
it is really the opposite; it is rather the obtuseness of undeveloped 
perception which fails to take note of the large escort of dissimi- 
larities that, to experienced eyes, always accompanies and often 
obscures the features of likeness. To primitive observation a whale 
must always be a great fish; it is shaped like a fish, and it swims in 
the water like a fish, therefore it is a fish. To perceive in the whale 
a mammal demands eyes of a wholly different focus. The point I 
   
-P-A-G-E-771
  
  PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 691 
wish to make clear is, that the eye which has once clearly discerned 
the mammal in the whale can never, or with the greatest difficulty, 
get back to the infantile adjustment, and behold again only the huge 
fish of former seeing. Once leave your low-vaulted past and you can 
not return; you will never more, except in fancy— 
‘Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; 
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathéd horn.’ 
“The term fancy, from this point of view, comes to seem, in a sense, 
inapplicable to the first vision of the childish mind. It rather denotes 
the conscious effort, more or less abortive, of mature intelligence to 
throw off or divest itself of its acquired insight, and revert for sim- 
ple delight to a naive and unsophisticated mode of regarding things. 
When alittle child looks at a mask, it is a veritable face that he sees; 
there is no fancy about it. What we see is painted pasteboard; if 
we want a face we must fancy it. Or take the case of theatrical rep- 
resentations. In order to enter into and enjoy these, we must first 
dispossess ourselves of our sophisticated understanding, and try to 
forget and lose the thought of what they are in what they seem. This 
involves the exercise of fancy proper. To the little child such an 
effort is not necessary or even possible; he takes it all for reality. A 
half-grown boy, backward for his years, asked in perfect good faith 
where they buried all the people who were killed in the theatres! 
“These considerations suggest a pedagogical question of much 
moment, as to how early and how far what is called nature study or 
science teaching should be allowed to replace with conceptions of 
natural law the primitive or mythical way of viewing and interpreting 
phenomena. Whether there is not danger of dimming and impairing 
by enforced disuse this natural vision before the later insight of 
understanding is ready to take its place? To mix a diet of literature 
and science, of imagination and fact, in the right proportions for a 
child is no mean art, though there are not wanting practitioners who 
are more than willing to undertake it. 
“T have a few words to add in closing with reference to the position 
and character of child study in general. I have my doubts, as inti- 
mated heretofore, whether children can best be studied on the lines 
and by the methods of psychology, unless it be a psychology of a dis- 
tinetly physiological type; and even this appears to me inadequate in 
taking so little account of the influence of the social medium, for a 
child out of the environment of society would be not unlike a fish out 
of water. This is made apparent on every page of our records. 
“T do not see how certain problems of psychogenesis can find any 
satisfactory solution except through the procedure of physiological 
psychology; but when its methods of investigation have been fully 
applied, and the student has finished his work with the child, impor- 
tant and fundamental as that work is, there remains still the child as 
 
-P-A-G-E-772
ee 
692 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
a social embryo whose development is to be traced along new paths 
and under widely different conditions of observation and induction. 
I doubt if this task is to be handed over to the psychologist of the 
schools, for the reason that his training, however sound and broad, 
has been gained by dealing with phenomena that manifest themselves 
in a plane quite above and apart from childhood. The appeal of psy- 
chology is mainly, indeed almost exclusively, to adult consciousness, 
to the civilized and moralized man—a very different sort of being from 
the little child. Introspection, which is the main instrument and 
reliance in this study as ordinarily pursued, is manifestly inapplicable, 
if it be not an actual hindrance, in affording a true view of the mental 
condition of children. The bias of the introspective habit leads us 
inevitably to interpret their acts and deliverances in terms of our own 
conscious states, which are at every step so unlike those of children, 
quantitatively, if not always qualitatively, as to be positively mis- 
leading. As Rousseau says, ‘we are always looking for the man in 
the child, without thinking what he was before he became a man.’ 
“Psychology as such has no alternative but to regard the child as a 
little man, a homunculus; whereas the mere fact of its immaturity 
and the shifting proportions which its facilities bear to each other in 
point of relative development at successive stages should suffice to 
put it, as an object of study, in a category of its own. Landor says, 
with characteristic insight, ‘Children are not men or women; they are 
almost as different creatures, in many respects, as if they were never 
to be one or the other; they are as unlike as buds are unlike flowers, 
and almost as blossoms are unlike fruits.’ What, for example, can 
any adult discover in himself that explains the savagery of the boy or 
the doll passion of the girl? Imagine the mental attitude of a butter- 
fly that should attempt by introspection to account for the voracious- 
ness of the larva of its own species! There is more than growth in 
the. change from infancy to maturity; there is metamorphosis, and 
that often of a character little short of cataclysmal. The instability 
of childhood, the continual change of its center of gravity that results 
from rapid and many-sided development, is such as to defy explana- 
tion by any reference to what the grown man, psychologist or other, 
can find by searching the recesses of his own mind. Every process 
and step whereby he has come to be what he is, everything that has 
contributed to make him an adult, has carried him farther and farther 
away from the condition of childhood, and the door has been closed 
behind him at each stage of his advance. 
“The child is a child chiefly in this, that with him racial instinct 
stands in the place of individual experience. His motives are impul- 
sive and immediate. His mental vision is of short focus, narrow 
field, and high magnifying power. His view of things is all fore- 
ground, with no perspective of time, place, causality, or any of the 
relations of natural or logical consistency. He has but the faintest    
-P-A-G-E-773
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. 693 
idea of probability or contingency. In his world, as in the world of 
dreams, all things are possible, and one event is about as likely to 
happen as another. Hence perhaps his instinctive credulity, one of 
the most attractive of childish traits. There is little distinction or 
detachment between things present, things remembered, and things 
imagined. In place of a disciplined and consistent will, he possesses 
but the fragments or segments of physiological reflexes and instine- 
tive impulses, combining almost at random and acting with capri- 
cious inconstaney. ‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will.’ In his feelings 
alone does the child, like the higher animals, make a near approach 
to the adult type, though still with marked differences. Sensitive- 
ness in general, and fear in particular, are very prominent. There is 
much of the same instability and fluctuation, and, owing to lack of 
inhibitory power, a tendency to passionate excess. The general cur- 
rent of feeling sets strongly in the direction of the ego, though varied 
by occasional eddies of altruism that constitute much of the charm of 
early childhood. I need not say that this presentation is but a sketch, 
and makes no pretentions to literal accuracy or completeness.” 
* * * * * * * 
“Children must be compared with children. And they should be 
studied chiefly in their gross and complex activities, not too analyti- 
cally, and with constant reference to the social medium which is their 
natural element. As an object, a child should be held at a good focal 
distance; bring it too near the eye, and it becomes an unintelligible 
blur. Hence a certain clarified common sense, that takes account of 
the ensemble of conditions, is a better outfit for child study than a 
vision which the scientific habit may have rendered too intensive and 
microscopic. And in our interpretative comparisons, as has been 
hinted, it is better to direct the view downward than upward, even to 
the extent of classing children at first with savages or with animals, 
rather than with the fully developed man. I am glad to find this 
opinion supported by so high an authority as Professor Preyer, of 
Berlin, who, as a distinguished man of science, will not be suspected 
of inclining too much to the popular side. He says, in the preface to 
his ‘Mental Development of the Child’ (p. xvii, Brown’s translation): 
‘Although the little child shows himself to the observer always with- 
out the least dissimulation—unveiled in both the literal and the fig- 
urative sense of the word—still there is great danger, with the anthro- 
pomorphic tendency of most people in their way of looking at things, 
that more will be attributed to the child than actually belongs to him. 
Moreover, knowledge of mankind is not of much help here at first, 
because everything which at a later period comes forth, obscurely or 
openly, is now present only in the germ. On the other hand, the 
observation of untrained animals, especially young ones, and the 
comparison of the observations made upon them with those made 
upon little children, have often been found by me very helpful toward 
   
-P-A-G-E-774
  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
an understanding of children; and I hope from the completion of a 
comparative psychology, together with the inauguration of psycho- 
genetic observations, more results than froin the prosecution of earlier 
psychologies of a more speculative sort.’” 
* me % * % * * 
“Finally, it should ever be borne in mind that the study of children 
has wider and richer interests than those of psychology or pedagogy 
or any mere science. It touches ‘the human heart by which we live.’ 
It is worthy to stand, and it ought to stand, by itself. Its methods 
are for the most part yet to be devised, and the fullness of its outcome 
is not at present to be foretold or foreseen. I believe it holds the 
largest possibilities of delight, of increase of knowledge, and of prac- 
tical utility. Yet its highest ideal, to my thinking, is simply enjoy- 
ment of childhood through sympathy and insight, without any ulterior 
purpose whatever.”

  CHAPTER XIV. 
DISCUSSION OF EDUCATIONAL TOPICS BY PRESIDENT 
FRANCIS A. WALKER, OF THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTI- 
TUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS 
LIFE. 
The sudden death of Gen. Francis A. Walker removed from our 
midst one of the most influential and forceful men identified with 
educational interests. His personal attractions, scholarly attainments, 
versatile ability, and strong convictions brought him to honor in many 
departments of public and scientific activity. 
The merest outline of his valued career is enough to indicate a man 
of rare powers. The principal events of his life are thus summarized 
in the Quarterly of the American Statistical Association March, 1897: 
Gen. Francis A. Walker was born in Boston July 2, 1840. He was graduated 
at Amherst College in 1860, and entered upon the study of law. At the outbreak 
of the civil war he immediately enlisted and served during the larger portion of 
the war as an adjutant-general. At the close he was made brigadier-general by 
brevet. 
After his military service, President Walker became instructor in Latin 
and Greek at Williston Seminary, and in 1868 was engaged upon the editorial 
staff of the Springfield Republican. In 1869 he was appointed by President Grant 
to take charge of the Bureau of Statistics, Treasury Department, Washington; 
and at the age of 30 (in 1870) he was made Superintendent of the Ninth Census. 
In 1872 he was Commissioner of Indian Affairs. From 1878 to 1881 he occupied 
the chair of political economy and history at the Sheffield Scientific School. In 
1876 he was selected to be chief of the Bureau of Award of the Centennial Expo- 
sition. While at the Sheffield Scientific School he was a member of the school 
committee of New Haven and of the board of education of Connecticut, showing 
at this time the active interest in public school education which he never lost. 
He was a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University from 1877-1879. In 1878 he was 
called upon to represent the United States in the Monetary Conference at Paris. 
In 1878 he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and was vice- 
president of that body from 1890 until his death, and, in the absence of Dr. Gibbs, 
presided over its last meeting in November, 1896. When the time for taking the 
Tenth Census arrived, President Walker was appointed to superintend that work. 
The Census of 1880 was a greater undertaking than any preceding census, and 
more than twenty volumes was the outcome of the plan. This work established 
the reputation of President Walker in Europe as a statistician of the highest 
order. 
General Walker became president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
in 1881. In 1883 he was made a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society. 
From 1882-1890 he served as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, 
and as a member of the school committee of Boston from 1885-1888, In 1882 he 
695.
-P-A-G-E-776
  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
was elected president of the American Statistical Association, a position which 
he held until his death. President Walker became a member of the International 
Statistical Institute in 1885 (honorary member and president adjoint, 1893). 
From 1884-1890 he was chairman, Massachusetts Topographical Survey Commis- 
sion. In 1882, 1883, and 1896 President Walker lectured at Harvard University. 
From 1885 to 1892 he served as president of the Economic Association. In 1888 he 
was made correspondent of the Central Statistical Commission of Belgium; in 
1889 an officer of the French Legion of Honor, and in 1893 a correspondent of the 
Institute of France. He was president of the Massachusetts Military Historical 
Society from 1891. From 1892, he was vice-president of the American Society for 
the Promotion of Profit Sharing. From 1892-1894, President Walker served his 
native State as chairman of the Massachusetts Board of World’s Fair Managers. 
He became a corresponding member of the British Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science in 1894. Besides serving Boston as a member of the school 
committee, President Walker was a member of the Art Commission from 1890, a 
trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts since 1887, member of the Park Commission 
from 1890 to 1896, and a trustee of the Public Library from May, 1896, until his 
death. 
Of Dr. Walker’s distinctive work as an educator, Dr. Davis R. 
Dewey writes as follows:! 
There is a close association between his social and economic philosophy and 
the principles of education which he advocated. In education he stood for manual 
training, the kindergarten, and cooking and sewing schools for the mass; and for 
those who had the aptitude, technical training of a higher order, not only forits own 
sake as an educational factor, but as a conserver of the industrial and economic 
forces of the nation which now go to waste or wreck. Such training is a bulwark 
to the laborer in helping him to resist pressure and thus make competition a force 
working for good instead of for destruction. His views on the general educational 
value of manual and technical training have been repeated again and again in 
public addresses, and may be found briefly summarized in print in “‘A Plea for 
Industrial Education in the Public Schools” (Boston, 1887), and in an address 
delivered before the convocation of the State of New York, 1891, published in 
volume 4 of the Technology Quarterly. 
Mr. Walker took an earnest interest in public-school education. During the 
period that he was connected with the Sheffield Scientific School he was a member 
of the Connecticut State Board of Education and of the municipal school committee 
of New Haven. When he came to Boston this interest in public school education 
was continued. He was a member of the State Board of Education of Massachu- 
setts from 1882to1890. In this connection he was especially interested in making 
the normal schools truly professional. His influence was particularly felt in 
behalf of better laboratories, gymnasiums, and hand work. As a visitor at 
Wellesley College his influence was felt in the shaping of the scientific depart- 
ments. He was a member of the Boston school committee from 1885 to 1887, and 
here made his spirited attack upon the teaching of arithmetic, and was instru- 
mental in securing a reduction of the amount of time given to this study and a 
rationalizing of the instruction. 
His chief glory, however, in education was his administration of the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, to which he was called in 1881. Over this he 
exercised a judicious, intelligent, and progressive administration. The wise plans 
of its founder, President Rogers, were developed and no error was made to check 
its growth. During this period of fifteen years the number of students increased 
from 302 to 1,198. Five new department courses have been added—electrical 
1In the Review of Reviews, February, 1897.

engineering, chemical engineering, sanitary engineering, geology, and naval archi- 
tecture. Instead of one building there are now four. There has been a wise 
recognition of the independent organization of the various departments, with, 
however, a beneficial coordination at all necessary points, He has supported a 
generous recognition of the study of language and literature, history and political 
science, as essential to a harmonious training of the engineer. 
His work at the institute, however, should not be left without reference to his 
relations to the student body. These were indeed unique. Although giving no 
instruction, and never meeting the students in a class save possibly some two or 
three times a year when called upon for a special lecture, yet he knew, I think, 
every man of the graduating class each year, and could also address by: name 
scores, if not hundreds, of other students of the school. He had their complete 
confidence and admiration. He never addressed the students on questions of 
discipline, for such questions did not arise under his administration, but every 
student with whom he came in contact—and scores saw him at one time and 
another in his office—felt an inspiration in personal contact, and by the uncon- 
scious influence of the manliness of their president. 
President Walker’s address on graduation day, in presenting diplomas, was 
brief, but always heard with eager interest. It was a message burdened with 
warm gratulations for the completion of a long course of laborious and honorable 
study and achievements. The student who heard it felt anew that he had been a 
worker, had lived with workers, and with earnest endeavor would go on through 
life a worker. It was honest and manly toil that counted. 
Hon. Carroll D. Wright, in a commemorative address before the 
American Statistical Association, said: 
It may be that we shall conclude that the most monumental work undertaken 
by President Walker was the administration of the affairs of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. I have spoken of his equipment for that position. His 
experience at Williston and at Yale confirmed him in his estimate of a sound, 
practical education. Never ignoring the classics, always broad enough to appre- 
ciate and foster all that belongs to a college of the liberal arts, he, nevertheless, 
understood more thoroughly than most educators fifteen years ago the real neces- 
sity of the most complete scientific education. He therefore entered upon his 
duties in the institute with more than the ardor of an educator, for he had but 
little to do with teaching as such. His breadth of mind enabled him to under- 
stand the needs of the institute, and his great administrative abilities made him 
familiar at all times with all the features of the various curricula. His innova- 
tions were of the very greatest help to the young man seeking to equip himself 
for his life contests. He never believed in giving diplomas to men who had 
simply stayed the required time in the institution over which he presided; but 
when a young man was not competent to take the full course, or through ill-health 
or other adverse conditions was obliged to drop out of some of the departments, 
he gave him every opportunity to secure a special certificate in some one branch, 
By this means he has sent out into the world men often without a diploma to be 
sure, but thoroughly competent to take charge of work intrusted to them. We 
all know many of these young men,—-we know their success; we know their 
loyalty to President Walker. He was their friend always, and at all times ready 
to aid with his advice and assist materially with his recommendations. While 
carrying the student roll of the institute from 302 to 1,198 during his incumbency 
of the presidency, he raised the standard of the school in like proportion. The 
graduates of the institute are found everywhere, and, sofar as my own knowledge 
is concerned, always with the same result as to their standing and their efficiency. 
It must be admitted that as an educator in the very highest sense President

Walker had no superior, and with that rare faculty of acquiring a personal rela- 
tionship to each student his influence has never been surpassed, except it may be 
in the case of Mark Hopkins. 
Dr. H. W. Tyler, one of Dr. Walker’s associates in the institute, 
thus characterizes his distinctive power as an educational leader: 
Some have won fame in education by profound research in the philosophy or 
history of pedagogics, some by assiduous labors in promoting the material welfare 
of schools or colleges, some by their skill in swaying the feelings and opinions of 
learned or legislative bodies. In none of these directions lay President Walker’s 
greatest strength. 
He was preeminently a leader, preeminently a leader of young men. His sol- 
diers fought with his courage, his students studied with his insight, his associated 
teachers taught with his enthusiastic, vivifying zeal. He knew young men, he 
rejoiced in young men, and his knowledge was power over them and power in 
them. With most intimate sympathetic acquaintance with their qualities he 
always judged them with abounding charity. The earnest student, without ever 
exchanging a word with the president, felt for him the cordial confidence of a 
younger brother. Even the inveterate shirk, coming to him perhaps for censure, 
was uplifted by his generous optimism, gaining self-respect and becoming for the 
time, at least, as earnest as his fellows. With his nearer associates and friends 
he had that sunny cordiality which radiates light and warmth, but which so 
rarely survives the stress and strain of toilsome middle life. 
The earnestness characteristic of institute students made President Walker’s 
work with them peculiarly congenial, and he, on the other hand, enriched them 
by holding up earnestness as good in itself and as good for other purposes as well as 
for the primarily interested object of self-advancement, The institute was always 
to him ‘‘a place for men to work and not for boys to play,” yet with their less 
serious side of life—their publications, their societies, and, notably, their athletics, 
none had keener sympathy than he. Young manhood was admirable to him in its 
physical as well as in its mental perfection. 
His own intense activity and his insistence in earnest work have at times exposed 
him to misconception. It has been said that ‘‘the one intent and aim before him 
in his building up of the Institute of Technology was to make the course so vig- 
orous that only the strongest could hope to complete it. It was an institution 
where men went to equip themselves for life work, not a hospital for the treat- 
ment of mental weaklings.” The second sentence needs no confirmation, the first 
is altogether misleading. He was sensitive, almost to excess, on the subject of 
mental overwork by students. The faculty of the institute sets a definite, well- 
understood limit to the work to be required of any regular student in any term. 
Time and again he took pains not merely to enforce this rule, but to call the atten- 
tion of overzealous teachers to its importance. Time and again he cautioned 
students.against attempting even so much, if beyond their strength. Quality of 
of work, not quantity, was his requirement, as it was that of the faculty. The 
fact that institute students are thrown so fully on their own responsibility makes 
it possible for some to overwork, for others to neglect their work; he desired as lit- 
tle the former result as the latter. 
As an administrator, President Walker sought always to lead rather than to 
drive, to win assent rather than to compel acquiescence, Perhaps because he had 
~ known war, he avoided even verbal antagonism in time of peace. His courage of 
opinion may not be questioned, but he knew and he taught others that much truth 
need not be hastily spoken. Neither in the faculty nor corporation of the institute 
was there lack of diversity of opinions and interests. His aim was always to 
secure harmonious action or else inaction until harmony should come.
-P-A-G-E-779
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 699 
Of teaching, in the strict sense of the word, he had in later years relatively little. 
The classes of his earlier time in Boston were fortunate in hearing his lectures in 
political economy, given to all regular students in their third year. Which one 
of them can forget, however helpless of memory as to theories of rent and wages, 
the affluence of illustration, the luminous exposition which, without sacrificing 
an iota of thoroughness or impartiality, removed mountains from the pathway of 
the faithful? To his temperament it was impossible to reduce economics to the 
metaphysical formalism of those who had made it a ‘‘dismalscience.” The ‘ eco- 
nomic man” was to him not merely a vague abstraction, but a mischievous device 
for making the unreal have the semblance of the true. 
If not a discoverer of new principles of education, or an exponent of a 
particular philosophy, of certain great fundamental principles he made enor- 
mous use. 
The reaction of the new education against the old had no more marked, no 
more beneficent element than the great development of the study of things as dis- 
tinguished from the study of books. Of the necessity, the dignity, the distinctly 
educational value of this study, President Walker was an unwearied champion. 
So, in his report of 1886, he says of the last graduating class of the Institute: 
“Those years had been spent in the work, not of decoration, but of construction; 
not in polishing the surface, but in building up the substance of mind and char- 
acter. Little time or thought had been expended in memorizing facts previously 
ascertained, or in rehearsing the opinions of others; but from the first day’s exer- 
cise in the laboratory of general chemistry, on through all their course, these 
young men had been taught to see with their own eyes and think with their own 
minds, weighing, probing, analyzing, testing for themselves, the substances and 
appearances which formed the subjects of their study, until, through the devel- 
opment of their perceptive powers, through the formation of a habit of careful, 
discriminating, and minute observation, and through the exercise of the faculty 
of judgment, the least gifted of them had become capable, as evidenced by the 
severe test of our thesis requirement, of selecting a field of investigation, isolating 
the subject-matter, eliminating for the time everything alien or adventitious, 
providing all the conditions of a true experiment, and, through the application of 
approved tests, making an actual contribution to human knowledge. This is 
what we deem education in the best and fullest sense of that term.” 
THE RELATION OF MANUAL TRAINING TO CERTAIN MENTAL 
DEFECTS.' 
The full title of my paper is manual training as an agent in the diagnosis and 
treatment of certain mental defects; but that statement exaggerates the impor- 
tance of the paper, since what I shall have to say on the subject is merely in the 
nature of suggestion and inquiry. I have, in fact, no results to announce, no 
formed conclusions, even, to express. My mind has been drawn within the last 
few years to certain phenomena which appear to intimate the probability, first, 
that mental defects, seriously interfering with progress in study and with success 
in the affairs of life, may exist without being suspected by parents, teachers, or 
play and school mates; secondly, that such defects do in fact exist far more fre- 
quently than is popularly supposed. Brought to these conclusions, it has seemed 
to me that manual training or the practice of the mechanic arts as a means of 
instruction, while useful in the case of students of normal minds and of the best 
abilities, may have an additional and most important use as an agent, first for dis- 
covering, and then for treating, these defects. Let me ask your attention, some-

  700 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
what at length, to incidents which have suggested the probability that parent and 
teacher and play or school mate have often to do with wholly unsuspected defects 
of mental constitution and organization. 
A few years ago I was called upon to act as the chairman of a committee to 
examine candidates for West Point, in one of the Congressional districts of Mas- 
sachusetts. The thirteen candidates were subjected to the usual examination for 
physical soundness; and all satisfactorily passed the test. When we came, how- 
ever, to the test of color blindness, a young man whom I had remarked as one of 
the most spirited, intelligent, and fine-looking of the group, advanced to the table 
and threw the skeins of colored worsted into groups so absurd as to seem actually 
impossible. One moment sufficed to show that he was wholly out of the competi- 
tion and entirely ineligible for military service. Here was a young man, evidently 
of more than usual intelligence and ability. who had gone to the age of 17 or 18 
without any suspicion on his own part that he had not the normal sense respecting 
color. His parents and the other members of his family from childhood had been 
accustomed to observe him in his dealings inside the house with colored objects; 
his playmates had doubtless on countless occasions made reference to the color of 
objects; and yet he had gone through all this, day after day and year after year, 
without having his suspicion excited that what they saw he did not see, and he 
had taken the trouble to prepare himself for an examination the results of which 
might affect his whole life without the faintest apprehension of his disability. I 
remember to have heard of a naval officer who went through the war and was 
afterwards discharged from the service for a long unsuspected color blindness 
which was almost total; yet for years he had been dealing with color signals and 
colored flags and ensigns. It is well known that the color tests introduced by 
boards of railroad commissioners in several States have resulted in throwing out 
not a few locomotive engineers of large experience who had never discovered or 
suspected their deficiencies. 
Take another instance: A gentleman came to my office to introduce his son as 
an applicant for admission to the Institute of Technology. The young man had 
received an appointment to the Naval Academy at Annapolis; had passed the text- 
book examination; had passed the ordinary physical examination; had gone through 
the test for color blindness; and then it was found that an object which he could 
see distinctly with one eye at the distance of 27 feet had to be brought within 8 
feet to be seen at all with the other eye. During all his childhood and boyhood 
he had never for a moment suspected the existence of this defect. Let me recite 
still another case: A lady of my acquaintance had very charitably taken into her 
household as a servant a young woman who was subject to severe nervous dis- 
order. She could get employment under no ordinary circumstances, and the lady 
Ireferred to had undertaken to carry a part of her burden by employing her. 
After the lapse of some weeks this lady, who had often observed the servant very 
closely and curiously when engaged at her work, especially while sewing, broke 
out with an exclamation, ‘‘Jane, do you really see anything?” The girl looked up 
in greatsurprise. ‘‘ Why, yes; Isee perfectly well.” Her mistress rejoined, ‘‘I do 
not believe that you see anything as we see it.” An examination by an oculist 
followed, and it was ascertained that the girl’s entire disorder proceeded from 
eyes that were simply a mass of defects and distortions. With treatment of her 
eyes the nervous affection in time ceased. I related this to one of the most dis- 
tinguished medical men in New York, for many years a professor in the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons, who rejoined, ‘‘ There are many such cases. Myson, 
a captain in the United States Army, for years suffered the greatest agony from 
pains in his head and the back of his neck before he discovered that the whole 
trouble was due to defects of vision.” 
I might go on for a long time enumerating instances which have come under
-P-A-G-E-781
  MANUAL TRAINING. 701 
my observation of a similar character; but what has been said will suffice to jus- 
tify the inquiry whether, if such defects in such degrees can exist in respect to 
matters so objective and so completely open to observation and to examination, is 
it not probable that defects of mental constitution and organization of the gravest 
nature are found in every schoolroom and in every large family, and that much 
of what the parent or the teacher takes to be the result of indifference, or willful- 
ness, or neglect is due to mental distortions, perversions, obliquities, lesions, and 
breaches of continuity, which have as distinct and decided an effect in preventing 
the proper and normal action of the child’s mind upon what is sought to be pre- 
sented to it as would the most objective deficiencies and injuries to the organs of 
sense. If parents and teachers and playmates and schoolmates can fail through 
years to see, or even to suspect, the existence of color blindness, for example, is it 
not possible, and even highly probable, that defects more deeply seated and of a 
more obscure character are the cause of no small part of the failures of the 
schoolroom ? 
Here is a child whose sense of hearing is seriously impaired. It is known that 
such deficiencies have existed for years without being suspected. In connection 
with the preparation of this paper a Boston physician has told me of a case recently 
coming under his knowledge where a young man had gradually become almost 
totally deaf through the slow process of the disease called adenoids, without his 
father, a practicing physician, suspecting the existence of the trouble until a late 
stage of the deafness had been reached. Now, in the case of such a child, what- 
ever is said loudly and distinctly is heard. The moment the teacher’s voice drops 
below a certain point, or her back is turned, or her speech becomes hurried and 
confused, the child loses all or a part of what is said. Something he makes out— 
perhaps by suggestion from what he has caught, perhaps by observations of the 
teacher’s lips or gestures; some other thing he drops entirely; a third thing, still, 
he gets wrong. The result is partial failure in his work. He does not understand 
the true cause. His teacher does not suspect it. In the same way there must be 
instances of mental defects where a more than usual effort on the part of the 
teacher, a more than usual degree of attention on the part of the pupil, enables 
the current of thought to jump the broken wire and pass to its object; but any 
slackening of effort on the part of the teacher or of attention on the part of the 
pupil allows the current to become dispersed and to remain without effect. 
It isnot for a moment supposed that the thought above presented is not familiar 
to all students of the mind and all teachers of youth. The only contribution, if 
any, which I can hope to make is in urging the consideration that such mental 
defects as correspond to the defects in the organs of sense, of which illustrations 
have been given, are vastly more frequent than we have been accustomed to 
believe and demand greater attention from us in dealing with individual pupils; 
and secondly, that we have in manual training an agent for a diagnosis of some, 
at least, of these defects, and, though doubtless in a lower degree, for treating 
them. We go into an orthopedic hospital and our very souls are torn with the 
spectacle of distortion and perversion and deformity which we there witness on 
every hand, but we comfort ourselves by saying, ‘‘ Thank God, it is only one 
child in a hundred who is thus afflicted.” For my part, I believe that the cases 
of mental distortion, perversion, and deformity are far, far more frequent, and I 
can not help believing that it is to such unsuspected disabilities and infirmities of 
the pupil that we owe a very large part of the failures of the schoolroom, which 
pass for instances of heedlessness, willfulness, and even positively bad purpose. 
If I am wrong in this, as I easily may be, then I have occupied your valuable time 
and attention to no purpose; but the matter has so strongly forced itself upon my 
thought as to compel me to give utterance to it here and to ask this great body of 
nactical teachers, as well as students of pedagogics, whether the subject is not 
leserving of special investigation and inquiry.
-P-A-G-E-782
    702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
If, indeed, it is reasonable to believe that defects of mental constitution and 
organization corresponding to defects in the organs of sense do exist in regard to 
any large part of our school children, then it seems to me clear that we have in 
manual training so called—that is, the systematic practice of the mechanic arts 
in connection with drawing as a means of school instruction—a very important 
agent, at least, for their discovery. 
If to the traditional studies we add manual training we have not only another 
test of application and capacity—a thing in itself of great importance, inasmuch 
as, by bringing in a new kind of test, we may largely correct the errors of the 
test afforded by text-book studies merely—but we have a test peculiarly suited to 
bring out the cause of any degree of failure in the performance of work. In the 
first place, the results of good or bad work with tools and upon materials can be 
measured, and gauged, and ‘‘sized up” with an accuracy which is not attainable 
in estimating the character of the work done in most of the traditional studies of 
the schoolroom. The teacher can see exactly in what degree the child has failed, 
and the child can see it for himself, which is far from being always the case with 
recitations and examinations. Not only so, but the teacher, as I believe, finds out 
much more closely the cause of failure in such work. If there is any tendency to 
misunderstand instructions and directions; if there are any defects in the child’s 
organs of sense or any broken wires in his mind, a penetrating teacher ought to 
be able, by repeated experiment, to ascertain the fact. The objective character 
of the work, the closeness with which the results can be measured, and gauged, 
and criticised, and especially the aid derived by the teacher from the fact that the 
pupil is almost invariably desirous, and desirous in a high degree, of doing his 
shop work perfectly, all these combine, it appears to me, to make certain that a 
child will not pass through any very long course of study in a school where such 
exercises are systematically conducted without the discovery of any physical or 
mental defect which may exist. I do not mean to say that in all cases, or even in 
the majority of cases, the seat of the trouble will be precisely hit upon; but at 
least enough will be learned to give the pupil fair warning that he does suffer 
from some disability which he must make special effort to overcome. At least 
enough will be learned to put pupil and teacher in a better relation of mutual 
understanding and mutual respect. 
Should the manual-training exercises disclose defects of mental constitution and 
organization, I believe that these same exercises may be used by the teacher most 
directly and beneficially in the treatment of such defects. Even though the teacher 
should not be so gifted as to be able to make the pupil’s work discover the cause of 
total or partial failure, or of special weaknesses or infirmities, I still believe that 
the mere practice of the mechanic arts is the best pussible regimen and gymnastic 
to which a mind in any degree falling off from the normal or suffering from any 
perversions or deformities can be subjected. What orthopedic surgery is to the 
body such, I believe, manual training in childhood is to the mind. I care com- 
paratively little for its influences upon eye or hand. Its chief work, in my view, 
is educational; and in that educational work I place foremost its power of recti- 
fying the mind itself, of straightening the crooked limb, so to speak, of strength- 
ening the weak joint, of healing the lesion which, if not cured, will proceed to 
deep and irreparable injury. Not one of us but has seen seemingly hopeless cases 
of deformity and weakness in childhood completely cured by the splints, the mas- 
sage, the fomentations, and the heroic surgery of the orthopedist. As I writeI 
recall the images of schoolmates and playmates doomed apparently to hopeless suf- 
fering and weakness who are to-day, by reason of such treatment, straight, vigor- 
ous, and comely beyond the standard of their race. A benefit similar, at least in 
kind, can, I believe, be wrought in the case of many children who enter our schools 
suffering from inherited and acquired defects of mental constitution and organi- 
zation by the judicious and intelligent use of the mechanic arts as educational

instruments. Iam not here and now speaking for the more gifted and fortunate of 
our pupils, though entertaining the strong conviction that manual training prop- 
erly applied in schools, freed from the crudities and errors incidental to the intro- 
duction of any new system, will prove of great educational benefit to the brightest 
and best of our scholars. I am speaking for a great body of children who, but 
for this new instrument of education in the hands of intelligent and skillful 
teachers, may go into life with serious mental defects uncorrected and even 
unsuspected; defects which will grow more serious and more hopeless with the 
progress of time and with experience of life. 
THE EXTENSION OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION.' 
The growth of scientific and technical schools on this continent during the past 
thirty years has savored of the marvelous. In part it has been due to the changed 
ideas and the transfigured ideals of the American people; in part to the recognized 
need of greater skill and more of scientific knowledge for the development of the 
natural resources of the continent and for the direction of its growing enterprises. 
In this movement of the age even the older institutions have been compelled pro- 
foundly to modify their traditional courses of study, substituting scientific and 
even technical instruction for much that was formerly deemed essential to a lib- 
eral education. 
Of the reluctance, and even resistance, which this movement has encountered 
from many who deservedly held high places in the old educational order, I would 
not speak with harshness. The notion that scientific work was something essen- 
tially less fine and high and noble than the pursuit of rhetoric and philosophy, 
Latin and Greek, was deeply seated in the minds of the leading educators of 
America a generation ago. And it has not even yet wholly yielded to the demon- 
stration offered by the admirable effects of the new education in training up 
young men to be as modest and earnest, as sincere, manly, and pure, as broad and 
appreciative as were the best products of the classical culture, and, withal, more 
exact and resolute and strong. We can hardly hope to see that inveterate pre- 
possession altogether disappear from the minds of those who have entertained 
it. Probabiy these good men will have to be buried with more or less of their 
prejudices still wrapped about them; but from the new generation scientific 
and technical studies will encounter no such obstruction, will suffer no such 
disparagement. 
Another objection which the new education has encountered is entitled to far 
more of consideration. This has arisen from the sincere conviction of many dis- 
tinguished and earnest educators that the pursuit of science, especially where its 
technical applications are brought strongly out, loses much of that disinterested- 
ness which they claim, and rightly claim, is of the very essence of education. 
For the spirit of this objection I entertain profound respect. I only differ from 
these honorable gentlemen in believing that the contemplated uses of science, 
whether in advancing the condition of mankind or even in promoting the ulterior 
usefulness, success, and pecuniary profit of the student of a technical profession, 
do not necessarily impair that disinterestedness which I fully concede is essential 
to the highest and truest education of the man. These gentlemen appear to me 
to have an altogether unnecessary fear of-the usefulness of science. They enter- 
tain much of that dread of ‘‘Fruit” which Macaulay, in his famous essay on 
Bacon, doubtless with something of exaggeration, as his custom was, attributed 
to the old philosophers. 
I am willing to admit that, in my humble judgment, many technical schools 
1 Remarks by General Walker at the dedication of the new science and engineering buildings 
of McGill University, Montreal.
-P-A-G-E-784
  704 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
have erred in addressing themselves too closely to the practical side of instruction; 
that they have in some degree neglected principles in the study of science, and 
have borne an undue weight upon mere knacks and labor-saving devices and tech- 
nical methods. I believe that in doing this they have made a mistake, even from 
their own point of view, and with reference to the very objects they profess. 
Moreover, I am free to acknowledge that those who direct many technical schools 
have made a mistake in altogether, or nearly so, omitting from their curriculum 
philosophical as distinguished from scientific, liberal as distinguished trom exact 
studies. Those technical schools will best accomplish their purposes of useful- 
ness, alike to their students and to the State, which make more of the sciences 
than of the arts, more of principles than of their applications, and which offer to 
their pupils, in addition to the studies which will make them exact and strong, 
some of the studies and exercises which will help to render them at the same 
time broad and kind. 
With only such a subordination of technical and scientific studies as is for the 
ultimate advantage of the technical professions themselves, and with such a com- 
plementing of scientific by philosophical studies as has been indicated, I believe 
that the work of the student in schools of technology is as fully entitled to be 
termed disinterested as that of a student in a classical college. In neither class 
of institutions can or ought the student to be unmindful that his personal success 
in life and his professional and social position are largely to depend upon the 
manner in which his work shall be done in college. All that can be asked in 
regard to any school is that there shall be zeal in study, delight in discovery, 
fidelity to the truth as it is discerned, high aims, and ambitions which have not 
sole or primary respect to material rewards. The strong desire to become a 
useful man, well equipped for life, capable of doing good work, respected and 
entitled to respect, constitutes no breach of disinterestedness in any sense of that 
word in which an educator would be justified in using it with commendation. 
The practical uselessness for any immediate purpose of a given subject of study 
may be no reason why it should not be pursued; but, on the other hand, the high 
immediate usefulness of a subject of study furnishes no ground from which the 
educator of loftiest aims and purest ideals should regard it with contempt or 
distrust. In either case, the question of real import is in what spirit the study is 
pursued. The most distinguished French writer of to-day on matters of educa- 
tion, writing, too, in advocacy not of physical but of social science, has frankly 
paid his tribute to the disinterestedness of spirit and loftiness of motive which 
promote and direct scientific research, even in its most practical applications. 
“Let us,” he says, ‘‘ pass in review the great founders of modern science and the 
creators of industry, the Keplers and the Fultons, and we shall be struck by the 
idealistic and even Utopian tendency peculiar to them. They are, in their own 
way, dreamers, artists, poets, controlled by experience.” 
And if, leaving abstract reasoning, we turn to contemplate the manner in which 
the several professions are practiced in the community, I seem to find corrobora- 
tion of the view that the study of science and its application to the arts of life do 
not tend to produce sordid character or to confine the man merely to material 
aims. Every profession has its black sheep and its doubtful practitioners; but, 
while frankly admitting that there are mercenary physicists and chemists for reve- 
nue only, I boldly challenge comparison between the scientific men of America, as 
a body, and its literary men or even its artists, in the respects of devotion to truth, 
of simple confidence in the right, of delight in good work for good work’s sake, of 
indisposition to coin name and fame into money, of unwillingness to use one 
thing that is well done as a means of passing off upon the public three or four 
things that are ill done. I know the scientific men of America well, and I enter- 
tain a profound conviction that in sincerity, simplicity, fidelity, and generosity 
of character, in nobility of aims and earnestness of effort, in everything which
-P-A-G-E-785
  COLLEGE ATHLETICS. | 705 
should be involved in the conception of disinterestedness, they are surpassed, if 
indeed they are approached, by no other body of men. 
Let us, then, cheer on every enterprise for the extension of scientific and technical 
education, without any misgivings as to its effects upon the character and subse- 
quent life of the young men of America, without any fear that they will be ren- 
dered sordid in spirit or low in their aims by reason of the practical usefulness of 
the studies to which they are called to apply themselves, There is a wonderful 
virtue in the exact sciences to make their students loyal, just-minded, clear- 
headed, and strong against temptation. Here no insidious tendencies to mere 
plausibility, to sophistry, and to self-delusion beset the young and the ambitious. 
The only success here is to be right. The only failure possible is to be wrong. 
To be brilliant in error here is only to make the fact of error more conspicuous 
and more ludicrous. Nothing but the truth, nothing less than the whole truth, 
this is the dominating spirit of the laboratory, which never withdraws its control 
over the student to keep him from the false path, which never intermits its 
inspiration as it urges him onward to the light. 
COLLEGE ATHLETICS.' 
I trust it will not be deemed beneath the dignity of this occasion that I should 
ask your attention to a few thoughts regarding college athletics. No theme is 
to-day of greater consequence to the colleges and universities of our land, whether 
as influencing school discipline or as affecting the standard of scholarship. Alike 
those who applaud and those who deprecate the growth of athletics must admit 
the importance of the subject. 
The past ten years have witnessed a remarkable development in the direction 
indicated, which we may well pause to consider. The rising passion for athletics 
has carried all before it. Thus far, at least, there is no sign of reaction, or even 
of the exhaustion of the forward impulse. Honors in football, in baseball, and in 
rowing have come to be esteemed of equal value with honors in the classics, in 
philosophy, or in mathematics; and if the movement shall continue at the same 
rate it will soon be fairly a question whether the letters A. B.in the college degree 
stand more for bachelor of arts or for bachelor of athletics. 
Among instructors and the governing bodies of our colleges there is a wide dif- 
ference of sentiment on the subject. Some applaud, some doubt, some disapprove; 
others are simply dazed and know not what to think, or suspend all judgment 
waiting to see how much farther the rising tide will encroach upon the shore. In 
the larger community there is, perhaps, an even more pronounced divergence of 
opinion. Few college presidents or professors but see some good in the new move- 
ment and sympathize largely with the enthusiasm of their pupils. But there isa 
host of editors, preachers, and men of affairs in the outside world, and a host of 
parents and guardians more directly concerned, who are sure that it is all of evil; 
that the colleges are simply going wild over athletic sports, preparing the way for 
the downfall of the traditional system of education. To many of these it is a mon- 
strous thing that large bodies of young men should give themselves up to contests 
of skill and strength, and that larger bodies still should find in these contests the 
chief interest of their college life. 
Fairly to approach the subject, we need to consider the state of things which 
existed prior to the war of secession; in other words, to go back just one human 
generation, as a human generation is usually computed. In those days gymnastics 
held but a small, a very small, place in American colleges; while throughout the 
wider community there was almost no athleticism. The two most important 
exceptions to the latter statement were found in the occasionally outlawed and

always disreputable prize fight, generally with some international complication, 
genuine or manufactured, for the sake of stimulating public interest, and in a 
small amount of rather poor, unscientific boat racing. Almost no honor was then 
given toa young man because he was strong, swift, courageous, or enduring, The 
college hero of those days was apt to be a young man of towering forehead, from 
which the hair was carefully brushed backward and upward to give the full 
effect to his remarkable phrenological developments. His cheeks were pale, his 
digestion pretty certain to be bad. He was self-conscious, introspective, and 
indulged in moods as became a child of genius. He had yearnings and aspira- 
tions, and not infrequently mistook physical lassitude for intellectuality, and the 
gnawings of dyspepsia for spiritual cravings. He would have gravely distrusted 
his mission and his calling had he found himself at any time playing ball. He 
went through moral crises and mental fermentations which seemed to him tre- 
mendous. From the gloomy recesses of his ill-kept and unventilated room he 
periodically came forth to astound his fellow-students with poor imitations of 
Coleridge, De Quincey and Carlyle, or of Goethe in translation. 
Not all college heroes of those days were of this familiar type. Sometimes they 
were thunderous orators, more Websterian than Webster, who could by a single 
effort lift themselves to the full height of perorations which in the senate or the 
forum are the culmination of great arguments and of many a passionate appeal. 
Sometimes, though more rarely, the college hero was a delightfully wicked fellow, 
who did, or at least affected to do, naughty things, wrote satirical verses, was sup- 
posed to know life, and in various ways exerted a baleful fascination over his 
fellow-students. But, however the type of the college hero might vary, speech- 
making, debating, or fine writing were the be-all and the end-all of college train- 
ing, as in the world outside the colleges speech-making, debating, or fine writing 
were the sole recognized signs and proofs of greatness. Physical force, dexterity, 
and endurance, capacity for action, nerve, and will power went for little, or went 
for nothing, so far as public admiration was concerned. Statesmanship itself was 
perverted by eagerness to seek occasions for oratorical display. Men of business, 
men of affairs, men of prudence, moderation, and real ability were crowded out 
of our legislative halls by shrill-voiced declaimers who could catch the ear of a 
nation given over to the lustof words. ‘‘Sir,” once said Daniel Webster, bending 
those tremendous brows upon a young man afterwards renowned among the great 
Attorney-Generals of the United States, ‘sir, the curse of this country has been 
its eloquent men.” 
What was the reason for this state of things regarding the college ideals of a 
generation ago, so strongly contrasted with what we see to-day? In part, bad 
physiology, or the absence of anything that could be called physiology, was 
responsible for it; but in greater part I believe it was due to the transcendental- 
ism and sentimentalism of the last quarter of the eighteenth and the first quarter 
of the nineteenth century, which had created false and pernicious opinions con- 
cerning personal character and conduct. There was more than indifference, there 
was contempt for physical prowess. A man who was known to bespecially gifted 
in this way was thereby disparaged in public estimation. If he were known to 
make much of it, he was more likely to be despised. It was taken for granted 
that he could not be good for anything else. Brains and brawn were supposed to 
be developed in inverse ratio. Affected notions about intellectuality and spirit- 
uality had almost complete control of the popular thought. The only things to be 
admired were mind and soul. ‘‘ Mere bigness” was a favorite phrase of contempt. 
Strength was believed to be closely akin to brutality. Danger, positive danger, 
to spirituality, if not also to morality, lay in physical force and exuberant vitality. 
The same notions perverted the ideals of womanly grace and beauty. Robust 
vigor, a hearty appetite, and a ruddy complexion would have been deemed incom-
-P-A-G-E-787
  
COLLEGE ATHLETICS. 707 
patible with the function of the heroine of a popular novel or a sentimental poem, 
or even with the part of a belle in society. Languor and pallor were attractive; 
delicacy of frame and limb was admired. 
The set of notions referred to were doubtless closely connected with the polit- 
ical ideas of those days. It was an eraof transcendentalism in politics. Political 
mechanism was disparaged, The philosophy of the age declared that a virtuous 
people would of themselves make a good government. On the other hand, it was 
impossible so to organize the public force as to give the people a government that 
should be better than themselves. The maxim ‘A stream can not rise higher 
than its source” was a conclusive answer to all pleas for the scientific treatment 
of political problems. There was an affectation of indifference toward size and 
numbers in national life. Quality, not quantity, was in the eyes of the men of 
those days the sole test of the worthiness and the greatness of a people. Mass 
went for nothing. ‘‘Mere bigness” was here, as in the case of the individual, a 
term of infinite contempt. I never shall forget the rebuke, not unkindly meant or 
harshly spoken, which I received from a distinguished leader of public thought 
for boasting in a boyish vein about the extent of my country and the greatness of 
its resources. 
The indifference toward or the dislike of athletics a generation or two ago was 
also largely due to the religious ideas and feelings of the time. The body was but 
ashell, a prison in which the soul was confined, and against whose bars its aspi- 
rations continually beat and bruised themselves. In another image, the body was 
a wayside barn in which the weary pilgrim laid himself down to rest till break of 
day. The flesh was an incumbrance to the spirit, a clog, a burden, a snare. Men 
had been told to ‘“‘keep the body under,” and perchance this was thought to be an 
easier task if that body were small and weak. 
I do not mean to be understood as asserting that in those days the mens sana 
in corpore sano was never spoken of, or that there was no formal teaching of the 
duty of preserving bodily health. Such precepts, however, could have little effect 
against general tendencies of thought and feeling; andeven among the mostintel- 
ligent teachers of those days there was manifest a strong dislike, a sharp shrink- 
ing from all dwelling upon the physical basis of life as savoring of materialism. 
As to acknowledging the relationship of man to the other orders of animals, that 
would have filled the pious mind with horror. The philosophy of the time had, 
indeed, to admit that the soul was in a degree conditioned as to its manifesta- 
tions, and especially as to its influence upon others, by purely physical causes. 
But the soul itself was a thing transcendent, supernal, and self-sufficing, which 
when released from the clogs of flesh became at once as perfect, pure, free, and 
strong as if its tenement, while in residence here, had been more worthy of it. 
All the notions referred to, so prevalent and so potent in at least this section of 
the United States forty or seventy years ago, have gone, and gone together. Other 
ideas better suited to inspire a progressive civilization have taken their place. In 
part this has been due to the decay of superstitions derived from primitive sav- 
agery, in part to the effects of positive teaching, in greater part still to further 
experience of life. Biology has done its share; political education has done its 
share; the war of secession wrought its appointed work in the same direction, 
The men of to-day are generally agreed that they are likely to live long enough to 
make it wise to think a hundred times how they shall live to once thinking how 
they shall die. The caravansary idea of existence has been abandoned. Man is 
nota pilgrim but a citizen, He is going to tarry nights enough to make it worth 
while to patch up the tenement and even to look into the drainage. This world 
is a place to work in; activity and development, not suffering or self-repression, 
its law. 
The present generation has witnessed a wonderful diminution of spiritual self- 
consciousness. Better physiology, coinciding with some changes in popular ideals,

has driven away the notions about the flesh as an incumbrance, a clog, a burden, 
asnare. It is seen that morbid or even merely feeble conditions of body tend to 
generate delusions, selfishness, and susceptibility to the worst impulses, This is 
seen to be the case not the less because of the saintliness and the heroic constancy 
of a million sufferers from pain and infirmity. Hearty physical force may, indeed, 
consist with vicious desires, but it does not favor them. On the contrary, it does 
in a way and in a degree tend to diminish and to uproot them. Vicious desires 
are at their worst in feebleness and in morbid conditions of body. The sounder a 
man is, the stronger he is, the less—other things equal—is he subject to what is 
bad and degrading; the more pleasure does he take in what is natural, healthful, 
and elevating. To a perfectly sane man physically life itself becomes a joy. The 
relish for it does not need to be stimulated by the spices of vicious indulgence any 
more than a healthy appetite needs to be stimulated by the spices of the cuisine. 
The sociological investigations into the causes and manifestations of crime, so 
actively in progress during the past few years, have added much to our knowledge 
of human nature in its self-respecting and law-abiding phases. The popular idea 
of the criminal once was that of a powerful brute, whose offenses against society 
resulted from an excess of physical vigor not counterbalanced by moral and intel- 
lectual forces. As a matter of fact, it is now known that the prisoners in our jails 
are, as a class, undersized and undervitalized creatures, often with a deficiency of 
codrdination between their faculties, sometimes with a minimum of control over 
their own actions and little adaptability to social and industrial functions. In 
the remarkable, the truly admirable reformatory enterprise of Superintendent 
Brockway at Elmira, gymnastics, regulated exercise, and manual training per- 
form a most important part. 
In the revolution of thought regarding bodily development and physical prowess 
Mr. Beecher exerted a great influence. He it was who led off in favor of muscu- 
lar Christianity. During the controversy on that subject which attracted so 
much attention just before the outbreak of our great war there was, we must 
admit, not a little of exaggeration on the part of the advocates of physical culture. 
Many wrote and spoke as if all evil was to be worked off in the gymnasium and 
on the race track; as if every vice of human nature would exude through the pores 
of the skin if only perspiration was sufficiently active and long enough maintained. 
But in spite of much that was crude and foolish, these men had got hold of a 
great truth, and they did not let go until they had drawn it out into the light. 
The war of secession, also, which has been adverted to, came in to produce a vast 
change in popular sentiments and ideals, as it showed how much nobler are 
strength of will, firmness of purpose, resolution to endure, and capacity for action 
than are the qualities of the speech maker and the fine writer, which the nation 
had once agreed chiefly to admire. 
With this change of opinion regarding physical force and physical training in 
the individual has come a notable change in the political philosophy of the age. 
Larger experience of affairs has shown the folly of disregarding political mechan- 
ism. Itis seen that it is hard enough to keep the balance of forces upon the right 
side, if every safeguard be adopted, every device used, and every means employed 
to give a preference to those who stand for order, decency, and honesty in the 
community. Weare all now for making the devil fight with the sun in his eyes, 
instead of at his back, and with the advantage of the ground against him, instead 
of in his favor. We no longer with confidence hold that a virtuous people will 
necessarily have a good government. On the contrary, we recognize that a people 
virtuous above the average may, through a bad organization of the public forces, 
be made to act almost as if they were the most cowardly and dishonest of their 
kind. * * * 1t is true that the stream may not of itself rise higher than its 
source, but by machinery we can send a stream a good deal higher than its source,
-P-A-G-E-789
  COLLEGE ATHLETICS. 709 
and can make it do there more of vitally essential work than could all the waters 
of old ocean lying at their level. Instead of discarding political mechanism, 
therefore, the men of to-day believe in political machinery, like that of the Aus- 
tralian ballot system. They have learned that by means of it they can help the 
cause of righteousness, and at times turn the scale against the forces of evil. 
They not only believe in political machinery, they even believe in political 
machines, actual structures of wood and glass like the patent ballot box, as 
important agencies to defeat the baser elements of society. 
Again, ‘‘mere bigness” has ceased to be a term of contempt as applied to 
nations. Power in a people has become a thing admired. It is felt that it is 
indeed a glorious thing to have a giant’s strength, nor is it longer believed that 
the disposition to use strength tyrannously grows with the opportunity. The 
idea once prevalent that its possession leads to brutality and insolence has not 
been borne out by the history of our own people. As the United States have 
grown more powerful they have grown more peaceful. hear 
After this long and tedious statement of changes in the ideas and sentiments of 
our people in the several directions indicated, is it too much to say that we have, 
as a community, got down upon a sound, practical, sensible, worldly basis of life, 
much more promising for morality, for a steadily progressive civilization, for 
enduring enthusiasms—aye, for worthy aspirations and a true spirituality—than 
the unreal, morbid transcendentalism and sentimentalism of three, two, or even 
only one generation ago? 
Among the many things, good or bad as people may esteem them, resulting 
from the changes in feelings, views, and ideals which have been indicated are 
two which especially concern colleges and college men: The first is the general 
disappearance, most fortunate as I esteem it, of the literary societies formerly so 
flourishing and the decay of oratory, declamation, and debate, which to many 
once made up the main interest of college life. The second is the rapid growth of 
athletics, in which immense honor is given to young men because they are 
strong, swift, enduring, and brave; in which the blood of the whole community 
is stirred by physical contests among the picked youth of the land as once it was 
only stirred by tales of battle. This last it is which has given me my subject 
to-day. 
That the general introduction of gymnastics into colleges is desirable few will 
deny. Young men of the college age whose occupations are largely sedentary 
should be encouraged to undertake systematic and extended exercise in order to 
correct the faults of the study and recitation room, to expand their frames, and to 
promote an active circulation. Amherst is entitled to the high honor of being the 
first of the American colleges to make ample and suitable provision for students’ 
needs in this respect. In 1861, under the presidency of Dr. Stearns, a gymnasium, 
large and well equipped according to the standard of those days, was placed upon 
the campus. Daily exercise was made compulsory upon students not excused for 
cause, and a certificated physician was made director of physical culture and 
lecturer on physiology and hygiene. Few colleges have followed Amherst in 
making exercise other than in the form of military drill compulsory; but fewer 
still now fail to afford their pupils opportunity for voluntary gymnastics to the 
top of their bent. The improvement wrought by these means in the physique of 
our college students does not need to be shown statistically. It is manifest to the 
eye of the most casual observer who remembers the former state of things. So 
far there is no ground of debate. Difference of opinion only exists with respect 
to the competitive sports and games which have grown up out of the newly 
awakened interest in physical prowess. 
And here let me propose a distinction between gymnastics and athletics, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-790
  710 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
will be carried through the remainder of this discussion. That distinction is not 
one based upon etymology, but has reference to current usage: 
Gymnastics are for individual training and development, with health strongly 
in view. Athletics take the form of competition and contest; emulation is their 
moving spirit, glory the aim. 
As thus distinguished in their primary objects, athletics differ from gymnastics 
in two respects: First, by specialization, as when a man chooses his line of work 
in athletics—whether that be pole vaulting, or hurdle racing, or rowing, or pitch- 
ing in baseball, or playing a certain position in football—and thereafter devotes 
his energies to working himself up to the highest point of efficiency in that line; 
secondly, by excess in the amount of exercise over what would be required or 
would be performed without the introduction of the spirit of emulation. So great 
is this excess that it may not unfairly be said that athletics begin where gymnas- 
tics leave off. 
The effects of specialization in athletics are too much a matter of detail to be 
entered upon here. Sufiice it, in a word, to say that they are not unlike those of 
specialization in industry—good and evil being mingled, with, in general, the pre- 
ponderance largely on the side of the good. Specialization affords to bodily exer- 
cise a more direct object and creates a far more intense and sustained interest. 
Moreover, for the best specialized work it is well known that at least a fair all- 
round development is almost always a necessary condition. 
The excess of exercise in athletics over gymnastics, as we have defined these 
terms, is it of good or of evil? Isita gain, or mere waste, or a positive injury? 
Gymnastics are a means to the end of health and vigor. Athletics become an end 
in themselves. With exceptions too inconsiderable to be enumerated, the athlete 
competing for championship honors takes more exercise, often far more exercise, 
than is required for health and strength with a view to the peaceful and industrial 
pursuits of life. Vital force is consumed, not created, by the final contests in 
which he engages, and not infrequently by the training to which he subjects him- 
self in preparation for them. The consumption of vital force in athletics, if we 
contemplate young men who are fully grown or nearly so, may be considered as 
of two degrees: First, where vital force is consumed in competitive sports and 
games as it might be consumed in study or in the production of wealth, without 
impairing the constitution or diminishing the physical endowment upon the 
strength of which the subsequent work of life is to be done; secondly, where 
exercise is carried so far and such violent exertions are made that not merely is 
the current supply of vigor used up in this way, but the constitution is under- 
mined and injuries are sustained or exhaustion induced, which result in leaving 
the man less healthful or less powerful through the remaining years of his life. 
Of the severer forms of athletic competition and contest, which injuriously 
affect the constitution and permanently impair the vital force, but one thing can be 
said. They are evil and only evil. No earthly object, except the saving of others’ 
lives or the defense of one’s country, could justify such destructive exercises and 
exertions. I am disposed, however, to believe that there has been much of exag- 
geration in the public mind regarding this matter and that instances of perma- 
nent injury from athletics are fewer than popular rumor or maternal anxiety 
makes them to be. The life history of the leading football players of the past 
fifteen years, notwithstanding the frequency with which contusions, sprains, and 
even broken bones occur in the tremendous struggles of that mighty game, makes 
up arecord of vitality and activity in the period succeeding graduation which 
proves that, despite the occasional outcries of the press, this form of athletic con- 
test works little enduring injury among thoroughly trained competitors. The 
more serious accidents of football generally occur in the beginning of the season 
and among players who have not passed carefully through the hardening stages 
of practice. Boat racing is probably fraught with much more of real peril to its
-P-A-G-E-791

participants; yet a distinguished English statistician, studying the life history of 
820 ‘‘ Oxford oars,” has reached the conclusion that, even after making due allow- 
ance for the fact that these were all at the start picked men, this great body of 
athletes showed a vitality distinctly above the average. Yet when all has been 
said, it is still beyond question true that in the present intense interest in physical 
contests there is a real danger to be guarded against, especially among the younger 
and less experienced competitors. 
Of those physical contests which result merely in the consumption at the 
time of current physical force which would otherwise, or might otherwise, be 
devoted to study, we can not dispose so confidently and summarily. To those 
who hold to the good old notion—the excellent, virtuous notion—that all young 
men go to college to make themselves scholars, it is, indeed, a great trial to have 
to contemplate a state of things in which no inconsiderable proportion of students 
treat scholarship as an object distinctly subordinate to gladiatorial prowess, and 
who really graduate, if they graduate at all, in athletics as a major, with classics, 
or mathematics, or philosophy, or something else as a minor, or perhaps we should 
sayaminimum. Certainly this presents a view of college life which would have 
filled with horror the founders and early governors of our New England colleges. 
And it needs to be said at the outset, in dealing with this subject, that there are 
hosts of young men coming to college whose circumstances and means and views 
and plans of life are such that they can not afford to treat their educational privi- 
leges in this way; who if they “go into athletics,” in the accepted sense of that 
phrase, will sacrifice the one opportunity offered them; whose presence with their 
classes means a degree of sacrifice and self-denial on the part of parents and friends 
which would make it little less than profanation to waste an hour of the time 
which has been purchased at such a price. And yet, with due consideration for 
the rights and interests of students like these, college athletics confessedly as an 
end in themselves are not wholly of evil. Several things have to be considered 
before we are fairly in a position to pass judgment upon them. 
The least important thing that can be said in their favor is that they afford 
enjoyment to vast numbers throughout the land; yet, for one, I would not treat 
even this consideration as unworthy of respect. The college athletics of to-day do 
wonderfully light up the life of our people. The great recurring contests and the 
intermediate practice games and friendly competitions of the several teams give 
acute delight to a large and increasing constituency. This nation has long shown 
the painful need of more in the way of popular amusement, of more that shall call 
men in great throngs out into the open air, of more that shall arouse an interest in 
something besides money getting or professional preferment. In these respects 
college athletics have made an important contribution within the past few years. 
The marvelous rapidity with which football has spread and is still spreading 
throughout the Western and Southern States shows how eagerly it is welcomed. 
as a relief to the monotony of life. 
A stronger plea for college athletics is made when it is urged that they result in 
stimulating an interest in gymnastics among those students who do not engage 
in competitive contests, and also throughout the general community. The effect 
of this may easily be exaggerated. There is. many a weak-kneed collegian who 
crawls out to witness the great baseball or football game of the year, looks on 
with intense delight, cheers the victors, if of his own side, as loudly as his limited 
lung capacity will permit, and then, when all is over, crawls back again to his 
room without so much as a conscious impulse to improve his own bodily condition. 
Yet it is certain that the cause indicated has an influence, and an influence not 
inconsiderable, for good. Admiration for manly prowess and the contemplation 
of fine physical development can not fail to secure a much wider cultivation of 
gymnastics than would take place without it. 
But, again, it must be said that the favorite athletics of to-day are, in great
-P-A-G-E-792
  712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
measure, such as call for more than mere strength and swiftness. They demand 
also steadiness of nerve, quickness of apprehension, coolness, resourcefulness, self- 
knowledge, self-reliance. Further still, they often demand of the contestants the 
ability to work with others, power of combination, readiness to subordinate indi- 
vidual impulses, selfish desires, and even personal credit toa commonend. These 
are all qualities useful in any profession; in some professions they are of the 
highest value; and it can not be gainsaid that it is the normal effect of certain 
kinds of athletic sports to develop these qualities among the contestants, as well 
as to afford impressive examples to the minds of the spectators. So genuine does 
this advantage appear to me that were I superintendent of the Academy at West 
Point I should encourage the game of football among the cadets as a military 
exercise of no mean importance. It is the opinion of most educated Englishmen 
that the cultivation of this sport in the public schools of that country has had not 
alittle to do with the courage, address, and energy with which the graduates of 
Rugby, Eton, and Harrow have made their way through dangers and over diffi- 
culties in all quarters of the globe. 
The last. consideration which I would adduce to show that what is sacrificed in 
athletics is not all lost is that in the competitive contests of our colleges something 
akin to patriotism and public spirit is developed, with results, on the whole, of 
good. It is true that young men often carry their manifestations of zeal and 
devotion to their colleges toofar. Yet, both as counteracting the selfish, indi- 
vidualistic tendencies of the age and as an antidote to the nil admirari affectations 
of our older colleges, it is a good thing that the body of students should now and 
then be stirred to the very depths of their souls; that they should have something 
outside themselves to care for; that they should learn to love passionately, even 
if a little animosity toward rivals must mingle with their patriotic fervor; that 
they should at times palpitate with hope and fear and anxiety in the view of 
objects which can bring to them personally neither gain nor loss. 
Of the special evils of college athletics as now cultivated, I do not purpose to 
speak at length. Some of those at present most clearly perceived are chiefly due 
to newness and rawness, and will of themselves disappear, in whole or in part, 
with time and further experience. Faults of method have yet to be eliminated; 
the traditions of the several games have yet to be created. For example, that 
regard for fair play, that respect for the rights of an opponent, that deference to 
the decisions of the umpire, so conspicuous in England, have there been the work 
of generations. They can not be built up ina day with us. Yet our people are 
wonderfully quick to learn, especially to learn everything that conduces to har- 
mony and adjustment of claims; the American is eminently and preeminently a 
political animal; and nowhere in the world are great crowds so orderly, peaceable, 
and good-natured as here. 
One of the first things which should receive the attention of all lovers of fair play 
is the complete abolition, once and for ail, of the unsportsmanlike system of 
organized cheering by great bodies of collegians grouped together for the pur- 
pose, with chosen youths of peculiar gesticulatory graces and preeminent lung 
power to start the movement and “deacon off ” the shouting. Such a line of con- 
duct, thoughtlessly resorted to in the heat of partisanship, is unworthy of edu- 
cated men. It is unfair to the visiting team, who, by all the laws of courtesy, are 
entitled to special consideration. How much more pleasing to the spectators, 
how much more creditable to the home college, if the stranger for the while within 
its gates were to be treated with something like the grace of antique chivalry! 
Again, we may confidently expect that the machinery for carrying on sports 
and contests will undergo a steady improvement. We see a remarkable instance 
of the virtue of this in the appointment of the second umpire at football, which 
at once did away with certain tendencies that had threatened to make the game
-P-A-G-E-793
  COLLEGE ATHLETICS. 713 
impossible. Audiences, too, must be trained to appreciate the finer points, to 
applaud good work by whomsoever done, and to be as virtuous as a Greek chorus, 
to the end that the game may be played by the players and not by the spectators. 
The cooperation of alumni is also to be invoked to give wisdom, weight, and tem- 
per to the action of the undergraduate bodies. Not least—nay, perhaps hardest 
of all—faculties are to be educated, to avoid intermeddling and petty dictation on 
the one hand, and to sustain the claims of scholarship and enforce the right disci- 
pline of college on the other. 
The last clause suggests one of the most important considerations related to the 
subject. Granting that something, and that not a little, of scholarship must be 
sacrificed if athletics are to be continued on anything approaching their present 
scale, may we yet believe that it is practicable to insist upon the requirement of 
at least respectable standing in the case of all who participate in intercollegiate 
contests. I believe that this can be done without interfering with the general 
movement, provided college faculties are true to themselves, fair, frank, and firm 
in dealing with the student bodies, and thoroughly honest in their treatment of 
the subject. I would not be understood to intimate that a certain amount of good 
sense would be out of place. 
Perhaps it will not be taken amiss if I allude here to the results of my own 
observation in a sister university regarding which it has been my fortune to know 
more than I do concerning Harvard. At Yale, and especially in the scientific 
department, the faculty appear to me to have been highly successful in prevent- 
ing a total sacrifice of scholarly standing to intercollegiate sports. But a small 
proportion of the champion athletes in that university, a smaller proportion still 
in the scientific school, have been men at or near the foot of their classes—the 
sort of men who have to be hounded, threatened, and repeatedly conditioned in 
order to keep them up to the mark. Notafewofthem * * * have been high 
up on the roll of academic honor. I attribute this excellent result to the thor- 
oughly good understanding between students and the faculty, to the absence of 
petty proscriptions and of all intermeddling as to details, and to the frankness 
with which the few positive requirements relating to the subject are stated and 
enforced, 
I fear there is little in what has been here said to give comfort to those who dis- 
trust and dislike college athletics—little which intimates the opinion that the 
athleticism of to-day is only a reaction after the former total neglect of gymnas- 
tics, or a mere passing passion among our youth. But if we concede that these 
exercises and contests are to hold their place in American life, is there no stopping 
place, no point at which college authorities or the young men themselves, on their 
own motion, in their own discretion, for their own good, can say, ‘‘Thus far and 
no farther?” 
I answer yes; there is such a natural stopping place. It is at the doors of the 
professional school. Among young men in the course of education, athletics 
should belong to the college stage; gymnastics to all stages. Whether this shall 
be done by regulation or be left to the operation of forces working upon the minds 
of the individuals concerned, I believe the result indicated will, in either case, be 
reached. Already the undergraduate principle is widely though irregularly recog- 
nized; and the movement of opinion is still clearly in progress in this direction. 
Here at Harvard you have seen many a renowned champion put off athletics as 
he entered the law school or the medical school. The rule should be made of 
universal application; and it will require but a little more of discussion, but a 
little higher education of student opinion, to bring this about. In and after the 
professional school, whether that be a school of law, of medicine, of divinity, or 
of technology, there should be no representative teams. The principle of competi- 
tion and championship should be dropped. Individuals should continue at their

pleasure to play tennis or cricket or football with their classes, with private clubs, 
or in town and county matches; or if teams be formed in such schools they should 
not be regarded as carrying the honor of their institutions around with them, 
Such teams should not expect victory. They should play for exercise and for the 
fun of the thing, and should accept their inevitable beating with serenity and 
good nature, recognizing the fact that since they have taken up the serious work 
of professional preparation for life they no longer have the time or the strength 
at command to make and keep them champions. 
There is one remaining question regarding the athleticism of to-day which I 
feel myself so little qualified to discuss that I did not even allude to it while enu- 
merating the things that might be said in favor of competitive sports, or at least 
indeprecation of the hostile criticisms directed upon them, which, however, here 
in closing I would fain propose to your sounder judgment and keener thought. 
It is whether the college athletics, which so many approve and so many con- 
demn, have not after all a deeper significance—whether this remarkable outburst 
of enthusiasm for physical development and for the perfecting of the human body 
is not related, perhaps vitally and intimately, to the growth of a feeling for art 
in this new land of ours. No classical scholar will for a moment admit that it 
was an accidental coincidence that the nation of the Old World which pursued 
athletics with the most passionate eagerness, which showered honors upon the 
victor in running or in wrestling not inferior to those which it gave to the author 
of an accepted tragedy—that nation whose tribes came by long and perilous jour- 
neys over stormy seas to witness the great athletic competitions by the banks of 
the Alpheus or on the Crisszean plain—was the same nation which carried the arts, 
and especially the plastic arts, to the highest point of perfection ever attained. 
If, indeed, there is believed to have been a vital connection between these seem- 
ingly diverse manifestations of Grecian life, who shall say that the remarkable 
enthusiasm for physical training and the intense interest in athletic contests which 
haye been so suddenly developed in our country may not be clearly seen a genera- 
tion hence to have accompanied, and that through no accidental association, the 
elevation of art toa far higher and nobler place than it had before occupied in 
the thoughts and affections of our people? The life class is the true school of the 
artist. The greatest of all who bear that name have been men who revered the 
human form, made it their chief study, and found in it their highest delight. If 
in truth this sublime passion is taking possession of the nation, who shall estimate 
at a price the worth of that inspiration? The vision of the Apollo may yet rise to 
the view of thousands out and up from the arena at Springfield, as erst it rose 
before the thronging multitudes of Olympia,

  CHAPTER XV. 
HORACE MANN AND THE GREAT REVIVAL OF THE 
AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL, 1830-1850. 
By A. D. Mayo, M. A., LL. D. 
We have told elsewhere the ‘‘ great and wondrous story” of the original incep- 
tion of a system of universal education, organized, supported, and supervised by 
the people of New England, in the varied civic relations of district, town, colony, 
and State. We have shown that the New England colonists were able to achieve 
this, the most original of all their public achievements, because they represented 
that portion of the English people most deeply committed to the British idea of 
self-government and most profoundly impressed with the conviction that the 
foundations of a self-governing Commonwealth must be laid in the religion, 
morality, and intelligence of its citizens. 
Besides this, until the close of the war of Independence, the people of New Eng- 
land were virtually of one mind on the subject of religion, strongly Calvinistic in 
creed and congregational in polity. Thus, although their original common 
school was what would be called, in our day, sectarian, it represented the almost 
universal public opinion of the time. What we now call ‘‘the religious question” 
in the common schools did not come up in New England until during the first 
half century of the Republic, and then was disposed of in its present fashion. On 
the other hand, all the colonies beyond the Berkshire hills and the Hudson River 
were, from the first, cosmopolitan in their national, social, and ecclesiastical com- 
position. Hence, their effort to establish a system of universal education failed 
entirely during the colonial period, and only by slow and discouraging efforts 
through the first fifty years of the national life had they reached the table-land of 
acommon school, essentially similar to that of Massachusetts and Connecticut, at 
the opening of the period now under consideration. 
We have also seen why it was that the new Southwestern States, developed by 
the first great Western hegira from Virginia and the Carolinas, inherited the old 
British method of the organization of education adopted by the Atlantic Southern 
colonies, the college and academy, chiefly denominational, for the children of the 
well-to-do class, with a meager provision for the mass of the white people, and 
were thus left at the mercy of a widespread illiteracy, prolonged till a later date 
than this now under consideration. And even the new Northwest, with its mag- 
nificent outfit of public school lands backed by the national indorsement of uni- 
versal education, was greatly baffled and hindered in placing on the ground its 
final school systems through the entire half century from 1780 to 1830 by circum- 
stances inseparable from the establishment of new free States in a wilderness, 
during the opening years of the nineteenth century. 
Thus, although it may be said in a large and popular way that by 1830 to 1845 
the American common school had been established in the twelve Northern States 
715
-P-A-G-E-796
  716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of the Union and that in the fourteen States then regarded as Southern a growing 
interest had been awakened and several cities, especially New Orleans, had estab- 
lished the American system, it is not remarkable that in the most progressive of 
these Commonwealths the public schools were far below the ideal of the advanced 
educators of the time. Indeed it was positively declared by such authorities as 
Horace Mann, Henry Barnard, and the leading common school reformers of New 
England, that in the States of Massachusetts and.Connecticut there had been, 
for a considerable period, a steady decline in popular interest and the effective 
support of the people’s university. And, although in the States beyond New 
England there had doubtless been a decided progress during the entire fifty years 
previous to 1830, a condition of school affairs prevailed through them all which 
left the opportunity for a general education of their people very uncertain, in 
many cases below the condition so deprecated by the foremost school men of New 
England. 
In short, the original movement toward the present organization of universal 
education for a fit American citizenship, at the period now under consideration in 
the twelve Northern States, had won its first victory over the almost hopeless 
obstacles that for two hundred years from the earliest settlement of the colonies 
had stood up in opposition, and in the fourteen Southern States were to success- 
fully resist its introduction for yet another almost half century, till 1870-1880. It 
isone thing to put into a printed constitution and even to organize into a new 
nationality for the loose union of thirteen contentious provinces a lofty ideal of 
democracy and quite another thing to incorporate the same ideal so that the peo- 
ple may stand before the world as a consistent democratic republic. Even more 
difficult has it been, first to gain the full consent of the whole American people to 
adopt the American system of universal education whose central institution and 
most powerful agency is the people’s common school. It was almost a century 
from the organization of the National Government before one-half the States 
adopted it. And it is not strange that, even when all the Northern and several of 
the Southern States after more than two hundred and fifty years of colonial and 
national life had after a fashion accepted this as the final system of general edu- 
cation, in 1830, the farseeing educational statesmen of that period insisted that 
only through a great revival, reaching from the Atlantic to the valley of the Mis- 
sissippi and penetrating to far-away New Orleans, could the common school sys- 
tem, then on the ground, be lifted up toward our present highly effective working 
agency for the making of good American citizenship. 
It is not difficult to understand the reasons for this slow progress of the com- 
mon school idea in the twelve Northern States before 1830, without imputing to 
their people an extraordinary indifference to universal education. It must be 
remembered that the original old-world immigrants to each of these colonies, 
British and Continental, had brought across the water the European system of 
education of two centuries ago. In that system a state church practically domi- 
nated and supervised the entire schooling of all classes of the subjects of these 
kingdoms and empires. Even the most progressive of these countries, Holland 
and Scotland, had not come to the New England idea of a system of universal 
education, established, supported, and supervised by the whole people. This sys- 
tem, despite all contradictions, still remains the most original and characteristic 
factor of the Puritan civilization of the New England colonies; the first time in 
human history when a whole people honestly and persistently undertook its own 
schooling for a self-governed State. The European ideal of industrial, social, and 
educational affairs, until the revolutionary epoch, remained virtually the ideal of 
several of the most powerful of these colonies, and only very slowly did the high 
walls of industrial and social caste and religious separation crumble before the 
persistent assault of the new American society, Still a majority of the original
-P-A-G-E-797

Northern and some of the Southern States put into their first constitutions a rec- 
ognition of the obligation of the Commonwealth to educate the whole people, and 
almost every new State added to the original thirteen, in the most solemn and 
positive manner pledged itself to the same duty. 
But perhaps no people in history ever found itself in a position more critical, 
embarrassing, and absorbing than the 3,000,000, one-eighth negro slaves, that 
appeared before the world at the inauguration of George Washington as first 
President of the United States in 1789. The war of Independence had only yet 
half emancipated these colonies from the persistent hostility of the mother coun- 
try. The irritation of this unfriendliness, aggravated by the disturbing influence 
of the French Revolution, kept the people of the United States stirred up until 
the close of the second war with Great Britain—1812-1815—finally brought to an 
end the long and dreary record of British intermeddling. The people of all the 
colonies had been left by the coming of peace in 1782 fearfully impoverished. 
The Government was bankrupt; was unable to pay its 250,000 veteran soldiers 
who had fought almost against hope through the seven years’ war except in paper 
certificates of indebtedness, more nearly worthless every year. Then cameon the 
excitement of the first immigration to the great new West and Southwest. Mul- 
titudes of the most adventurous and enterprising youth of the older colonies tray- 
ersed the wild passes of the great Appalachian Mountain barrier or floated down 
the Ohio River to seek a home in the paradise toward the setting sun; 
The population of the entire country was less than that of, at least, four of the 
present United States and was distributed over a region as extensive as Central 
Europe. There were few towns of considerable size, and by the lack of roads and 
the hardships of pioneer life the country was in no good condition for supporting a 
permanent system of education. The New England people had been left by the 
war in a state of religious demoralization which brought on the first revolt against 
the style of religious training that for two hundred years had gone unchallenged 
in the common schools. The towns in Massachusetts which, in their colonial 
estate, were able to support the town or grammar school, classical in its founda- 
tion, tributary to Harvard University, the precursor of the present free high 
school, by their changes in population, social and industrial affairs, had been forced 
to let it fall into neglect. In its place came up the New England academy, the 
child of the churches and private and municipal enterprise, which for half a cen- 
tury largely supplied the demand for the secondary education. As early as 1820, 
on the admission of Missouri to the Union, the contest over the extension of slavery 
was added to the already numerous exciting political questions that divided the 
people, culminating in the deeply absorbing events of the nullification period in 
1830-1835. Then came in the long controversy on the financial policy of the Gen- 
eral Government, in which the tariff and the banks arrayed the people in violent 
parties hostile td the verge of revolt. The northwestern and southwestern States, 
until 1815, were living under the constant peril of a most relentless and demoraliz- 
ing savage warfare, always stimulated by the malignity of Great Britain through 
the Canadas. Up to 1780 intercourse between the different portions of the country 
was laborious, Ohio being practically farther from Connecticut than Japan from 
Massachusetts to-day. 
Under these circumstances it is not remarkable that Connecticut, which before 
the Revolution had accomplished the virtual abolition of illiteracy and first of 
all the States had gathered a school fund, had been enticed into an organization 
in which the common school was so out of touch with the church that, for an 
entire generation, it steadily declined, and the sectarian academy and private 
school largely usurped its place. Rhode Island still held to the unflinching faith 
in individual freedom which had been so conspicuous in its settlement, and which 
became the great obstacle to organized effort for the common schooling of the

718 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
children. Maine wasa corporate part of, and New Hampshire in many ways still 
a virtual annex to, Massachusetts until 1820. Vermont had been so involved in 
her original territorial controversy with New York and was still so inaccessible 
to the other States, being practically ‘‘ out West,” that there could be only a very 
gradual development of general education. 
In Massachusetts the current of influence for a series of years seemed to be 
against the common school, whose establishment two centuries before had been 
her earliest title to historical renown, The old social British habit of sharp dis- 
tinctions in society was still powerful, and the wealthy and educated classes seemed 
more and more inclined to withdraw their own children from the ‘‘common herd” 
into private and denominational seminaries. In 1837, when Horace Mann assumed 
the office of secretary of the new board of education, he found the majority of the 
cities and large towns paying a much greater proportional sum for the schooling 
of a minority of the children in private than for the training of the majority in 
public schools. The State was paying but $2.63 per capita for the education of 
five-sixths of the children in the public schools, a sum not larger than the Southern 
States are now contributing for their new system of public instruction. The only 
supervision of the public schools was by school committees, elected by the people 
of the 350 towns and few cities of the State. Not more than fifty or sixty towns 
even obeyed the laws for the guidance of this class of officials. Tho public school 
reports revealed this neglect of official control, a great deficiency in the teaching 
corps, a shameful condition of schoolhouses, and even in many of the larger towns 
of the State a dangerous indifference in the conduct of educational affairs. 
But it would be doing an injustice to the people of New England to infer from 
this that interest in the general education of the coming generation had declined. 
There can be no doubt that in 1837 there was more good school keeping in all these 
States than ever before. The colleges had increased in number during the past 
fifty years, and were certainly better representatives of the higher education than 
at any former period. There was a fair amount of good work done in the 850 
academical and private schools of Massachusetts and in the seminaries of Con- 
necticut and the less progressive States. And although the common school in 
the rural districts had suffered from the habit of extreme separation, in which the 
people of every district, through an elected “‘ prudential committee,” retained a 
virtual control over the employment of teachers and the general conduct of the 
schools, yet in many of these towns there was a wholesome rivalry among these 
little obstinate district republics, which made for the welfare of the children. 
The schools were taught, in the more advanced towns, by the best young men 
and women, the students in the colleges earning the means of pursuing their own 
education by winter vacation schoolmastering, and by the daughters of the lead- 
ing families. The press had greatly improved since the days of the Revolutionary 
fathers. There were more libraries and more reading of good bboks as the years 
went on. The twelve years of the administration of Horace Mann, spite of his 
often disparaging estimate of popular culture, were distinguished by a great 
awakening of literary interest. It was the period of the rising influence of 
Emerson and the transcendental school of philosophy, the widespread interest in 
the romances of Sir Walter Scott and Dickens, and the birth years of our new 
American historical literature. 
The sufficient cause of this general charge of the decadence of education by the 
common-school reformers in New England during the first fifty years of the 
Republic has been shown elsewhere. It was not the decline, but the general uplift 
of the national education to a higher plane, that brought forward the group of 
eminent educators, not always as workers in schools, but as public agitators, that 
made the great revival of 1830-1845 possible. Before the Massachusetts board of 
education under the lead of its great secretary had begun operations, there had  
-P-A-G-E-799
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 719 
been a gradual awakening of the more thoughtful people of the New England 
States. In a number of schools, justly celebrated even by the severe tests of 
to-day, advanced methods of instruction were estimated at their full worth. 
Men like Carter, Emerson, Barnard, and Brooks had appealed to the people, 
and the legislatures*of all these States had been besieged by individual plans for 
important changes in the public-school laws. Essays at normal schools had been 
made in several quarters as a private venture. In Connecticut the conviction was 
steadily growing among the foremost people of the State that the public-school 
system must undergo a thorough revision. Even Rhode Island, last to come into 
the field, through the administration of Brown University by President Wayland, 
and the work of Kingsbury in his famous school for girls in Providence, and a 
rising up of the workingmen of the State, was preparing for her final effort at 
a later date. All things were getting in readiness for the revival of the common 
school, already beginning in the States of its birth, Connecticut and Massa- 
chusetts, and which was destined to spread like a great awakening light from 
State to State, from the seaboard in the Northeast to the valley of the Mississippi 
and to far-off New Orleans, the herald of a brighter day for the children of the 
nation. 
The history of this revival of the American common school includes nearly the 
second half century of the national life, 1830-1870, First came the work of prepa- 
ration, during the early years of the century, when the common school was 
accepted and set up in all the Northern States and the way prepared for the 
devoted band of educational reformers. This story has already been told. 
Second, the appearance on the stage in every Northern State, though every- 
where under the leadership of a few prominent New England educators, of one 
of the most justly distinguished and successful groups of educational reformers 
known to any country in Christendom. This article will contain a series of 
sketches of some of the most prominent of these men, and an attempt to estimate 
the character of their work. Third, the subsequent reorganization of the old 
common school of the Eastern States into the graded school system of the present, 
from the rural district and city primary up through the grammar and free high 
school departments, to the State university with its final curriculum of moral, 
mental, artistic, and industrial training. This period extended till the breaking 
out of the civil war in 1860. The overwhelming interests of the next decade 
arrested the progress of all educational life in the country till 1870, when a second 
revival of universal education even more radical and significant in the entire 
Southern and Territorial sections of the restored Union set in, which is now 
“in full tide of successful experiment.” 
HORACE MANN AND THE REVIVAL OF THE COMMON SCHOOL IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
On the 6th day of May, 1837, Horace Mann wrote in the third entry of a new 
diary: ‘‘Dined to-day with Edmund Dwight, esq., for the purpose of conferring 
with him on the late law authorizing the appointment of a board of education. 
Mr. Dwight had the civility, or the incivility (I do not doubt that his motives 
would place the act under the former category), to propose that J should be secre_ 
tary of the board—a most responsible and important office, bearing more effectu- 
ally, if well executed, upon the coming welfare of the State than any other office 
init. For myself, I never had a sleeping nor a waking dream that I should ever 
think of myself, or be thought of by any other, in relation to that station. Query, 
therefore, could he have been sincere in his suggestion?” 
On the 18th of the same month this “query” was answered by a written request 
from Governor Edward Everett that Mr. Dwight and himself should become mem- 
pers of the new board of education, with a renewal of the proposition that he 
would accept the office as secretary. The searching and pathetic words accom-
-P-A-G-E-800
  720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
panying this entry in the journal suggest that Mr. Mann, in his capacity of presi- 
dent of the senate of Massachusetts, had been consulted in this matter, possibly 
had been one of the influential authors of that memorable statute from which 
dates one of the most notable reforms in popular education in the history of man- 
kind. On his appointment as one of eight of the ten meimbers of the board 
named by the governor, Mr. Mann writes: ‘‘ This board, I believe, to belikea spring, 
almost imperceptible, flowing from the highest table-land, between oceans, which 
is destined to deepen and widen as it descends, diffusing fertility and beauty in its 
course, and nations shall dwell uponits banks. Jt is the first great movement 
toward an organized system of common education, which shall at once be thorough 
and universal.” 
The Massachusetts board of education was established by an act of the legisla- 
ture, passed on the 20th day of April, 1837. It was provided by this act that ‘‘the 
board shall consist of the governor and eight persons appointed by the governor, 
with the advice and consent of the council; each to hold office eight years from 
the time of his appointment, and one to retire each year in the order of his appoint- 
ment; and the governor, with the advice and consent of the council, shall fill all 
vacancies in the board.” Thelieutenant-governor of the State was alsoa member 
of the board, ex officio. 
It was characteristic of the political genius of the people of Massachusetts that 
this new agency, the State board of education, which remains to day the charter of 
its public-school system, contains no grant of power over State educational affairs 
save the appointment of its own secretary and the agents which are his staff, the 
general management of the State normal schools and teachers’ institutes, with the 
appointment of their instructors and workers, the charge of the State school fund 
and the supervision of all educational institutions wholly supported by the Com- 
monwealth. It can not touch the least district school or displace the humblest 
teacher. But, under a general indefinite authority of observation and suggestion 
extending to every school, and its duty of reporting to and consulting with the 
educational committee of the legislature, it has become perhaps the most influen- 
tial permanent department of the State government, and hasnumbered among its 
more than one hundred members many of the most eminent men and, of late, 
several distinguished women of the Commonwealth, including more than twenty 
governors of the State. We find in this roll of illustrious names few professional 
teachers, but many men of national reputation in every profession and active call- 
ing. The original members of the board appointed by Governor Everett were 
James G. Carter, Emerson Davis, Edmund Dwight, Horace Mann, Edward A. 
Newton, Thomas Robbins, Jared Sparks, and George Hill. By his election as 
secretary of the board, on June 29, his acceptance of the office on June 30, 
and the beginning of his official life on July 1, Mr. Mann ceased to be a mem- 
ber of the board. His place was filled by the appointment of Robert Rantoul, jr., 
and the place of George Hill by Rev. George Putnam. 
Never has the old Commonwealth been served by an official board containing 
more of signal personal ability and representing more fitly the varied interests of 
an American State than by this first board of education. Governor Edward 
Everett gave to it not only official recognition, but was himself one of the most 
earnest and influential workers during its first critical years. Mr. James G. Car- 
ter, probably more than any other man, had been the leader of the campaign of 
agitation which had at last brought the unwieldy and slow-moving legislature of 
Massachusetts to the important resolve to seriously undertake a radical reforma- 
tion of the common-school system of the State. Rev. Emerson Davis afterwards 
became the first principal of the State Normal School at Westfield. Edmund 
Dwight, of Boston, contributed the $10,000, with a proviso that the State should 
duplicate the gift, that established the two original State normal schools for Mas-
-P-A-G-E-801
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 721 
sachusetts, at Lexington and Barre, the former the first in the United States. 
Robert Rantoul, jr., was already one of the foremost of the younger public men 
of the State, and his untimely death was little short of a public calamity. Rev. 
George Putnam was perhaps the most powerful New England preacher of his 
time, greatly interested in public education, and one of the inner board of control 
of Harvard University. 
The election of the secretary, for by this name the State superintendent of the 
common schools of Massachusetts is known, is annual, by the board of education, 
and his duties are defined as follows: ‘‘ The secretary shall, under the direction of 
the board, collect information of the actual condition and efficiency of the com- 
mon schools and other means of popular education, and diffuse as widely as pos- 
sible throughout every part of the Commonwealth information of the most 
approved and successful methods of arranging the studies and conducting the 
education of the young, to the end that all children in this Commonwealth who 
depend upon the common schools for instruction may have the best education 
which these schools can be made to impart.” 
The wisdom of this peculiar organization of the educational authorities of the 
State, which, in several of its features, has been copied in numerous cases at home 
and abroad, is vindicated by the fact that under it the most sacred and delicate 
public department of the Commonwealth is practically rescued from the excite- 
ments and perils of partisan politics. The members hold office for eight years, 
without salary, and the secretary can be retained as long as his services are 
regarded valuable. Under this organization the State, during the sixty-one years 
since the establishment of the board of education, has been served by its secre- 
taries, always with fidelity and often with distinguished ability. Horace Mann 
was secretary for twelve years. 
His successor was Rev. Barnas Sears, afterwards president of Brown University 
and the first agent of the Peabody education fund, who resigned at the close of a 
seven years’ administration. Hon. George S. Boutwell held the office for five 
years, and only left it to begin the career of eminent statesmanship which has 
carried him through almost every high position in the gift of his own State and 
the nation. Joseph White was secretary for sixteen years, and left his mark on 
the body of admirable school legislation, of which he was probably the most infiu- 
ential author. 
John W. Dickinson, second only to Horace Mann in valuable service, especially 
in his patient work for the elevation of the country schools of the State, assumed 
office in 1877 and retired in 1893. His administration of sixteen years left Massa- 
chusetts the only American Commonwealth in which instruction in industrial 
drawing, free schoolbooks and stationery, and a right to an education in a free 
high school are given to every child in the State. Ninety per cent of the school 
children of Massachusetts are now under effective district supervision, and almost 
every school district is in possession of a good library. Four additional State 
normal schools, a system of perpetual visitation, and numerous teachers’ institutes, 
conducted by a corps of agents of the board of education, whereby every common 
school is brought under the eye of an educator of national reputation, with a score 
of excellent city training schools for teachers, attest the growing interest in this 
direction. Massachusetts now supports a common-school system in which in 1895 
some 400,000 children and youth were instructed in 7,833 free schools by 11,714 
-teachers, 10,705 of whom are women, more than one-third of the entire number 
having received professional training in the State and city normal schools. The 
system is supported at an annual cost of $10,000,000—$19.48 for each child between 
the years of 5and15. Theaverage wages of male teachers are $129.41 and of females 
$47.91 a month. The average length of the school year is eight and three-fourths 
months. Besides this, some 66,000 pupils are schooled in 99 academies and 359 
ED 97 4G

  722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
private (chiefly Catholic parochial) schools, at a cost of $674,000. A dozen char- 
tered colleges, with Harvard University at their head, and a great number of 
institutions for industrial, technical, and art instruction, business, music, and the 
various professions, are crowded with students from every portion of the country 
and were never so flourishing. 
No State in Christendom to-day excels Massachusetts in the universal popular 
interest in education, the extended infiuence of its entire system of schools, and 
the educational characteristics of its numerous institutions for charity and the 
reformation of criminals. Indeed, in the prophetic words of her first great secre- 
tary, she is one of the “nations” that dwell rejoicing on the banks of thatswelling 
river whose mountain spring, up in the highest table-land between oceans, is the 
board of education which sixty-one years ago began its modest existence with 
Horace Mann, a rising lawyer and politician of 41 years, already in broken health, 
almost penniless in fortune and bending under the great affliction from the recent 
death of his beloved wife, as its secretary. 
He heard the call and, turning his back on the brilliant opportunity of a great 
professional and political career, stepped upward into the little office room in 
Boston, not under the statehouse dome, where for three years he lived and slept, 
working sixteen hours a day on a salary of $1,500, with no official assistance, that 
the common schools of his beloved Commonwealth, attended by what he called 
his “80,000 children,” might be rescued from the decline into which they were 
falling. 
Henceforth the great revival of the American common school—for twelve years, 
or until 1850—was more and more represented, not only to Massachusetts and New 
England but through the whole country, by one towering figure—the new secre- 
tary of the Massachusetts board of education, Horace Mann. And the more 
intelligently and broadly the educational affairs of that period are studied, the 
more clearly it appears that this man was one of the providential makers of Amer- 
ican history. 
No man is suddenly lifted out of the dust of obscurity to enduring reputation in 
any work of permanent value in a country like our own. Especially has every 
notable character in the educational development of the Republic gone through a 
severe apprenticeship before emerging upon the uplands of public leadership in 
any truly progressive movement for the schooling of the whole people. Horace 
Mann was no novice when, at the age of 41, already a commanding figure in the 
professional and public life of a State that does not readily give its allegiance to 
second-rate men, the unanimous voice of a group of men like Edward Everett, 
John Quincy Adams, William Ellery Channing, and Samuel G. Howe selected 
him as a leader in a conflict that was sure to absorb.and finally exhaust the life of 
any man fit to bear the standard of reform into the confused wilderness that the 
common school of New England was becoming. It will explain a good deal that 
was not understood either by the contemporaries of Horace Mann or by many of 
the educational experts of to-day, if we trace his life from his birth up to middle 
age, when this great burden of honorable and perilous service was laid upon his 
shoulders. 
Horace Mann was born in Franklin, a seacoast town in Massachusetts, on May 
4, 1796, when the United States of America was but 8 years old. The town was 
named for Dr. Benjamin Franklin, who, it is said, intended to acknowledge the 
compliment by the gift of achurch bell. But, on reflection, as he put it, ‘from 
what I have learned of the character of the people, I think they would prefer 
sense to sound,” he gave the new town a library. Those little “town,” ‘‘ladies’,” 
“*social,” and ministers’ libraries, located in the center of these New England 
towns, explain a great deal in the life of their foremost men and women in the 
first half century of the nation. Like so many another boy, hungry and thirsty  
-P-A-G-E-803
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 723 
for knowledge, young Horace read. the town library through and declared: ‘“‘Had 
Ithe power, I would scatter libraries over the whole land, as the sower sows his 
wheat field.” 
His father, a worthy farmer, died when Horace was 13 years old; but the boy 
made the old place his home till 20, The mother was one of those sober, thought- 
ful, determined women of New England, who, under a laborious and almost a 
relentless routine of home life, carried the heart and will of a heroine. Those 
were the days of stern discipline in family and school, while the old-time mystery 
of high Calvinism was propounded by the Congregational Puritan minister, set- 
tled for life, in one sense, an ecclesiastical despot, yet an elected servant and rep- 
resentative, dependent for everything upon the good will of the most democratic 
community on earth. Dr. Emmons, a shining light in that tremendous dispensa- 
tion, as Mr. Mann said, ‘‘ through fifty-two years preached at and ruled the people 
of Franklin.” 
Until the age of 15 young Horace ‘‘had not a happy childhood.” The family 
was on short rations, and the boy says of himself: ‘‘I believe in the rugged nur- 
sery of toil, but she nursed me too much.” In winter he was shut indoors, braid- 
ing straw, by which he bought his own schoolbooks, and in summer was turned 
out to severe work on the farm. He wrote, later in life: ‘‘ Train your children to 
work, but not too hard; and unless they are grossly lethargic, let them sleep as 
much as they will.” But he did learnto work so that ‘‘industry became a second 
nature.” Until 15 he only had from eight to ten weeks a year of the district 
schooling of the town. And it was a meager diet to which his hungry and thirsty 
soul was invited. If the secret of education is, as he declared, ‘“‘ the love of knowl- 
edge, not the love of books,” he was, indeed, compelled to live on hard mental 
fare. The only schools he knew were a perpetual grind of memorizing school- 
books that were often apparently written rather to conceal than to reveal the 
secrets even of the elementary ‘‘three r’s.” There was no attempt at oral teach- 
ing; even an intelligent explanation was often above the capacity of the village 
pedagogue. The discipline was the logical outcome of the preaching in the church; 
both a fair representative of the belief of the influential majority. ‘‘ Sitting still,” 
with an almost impossible obedience to the arbitrary will of the school master or 
mistress, anda correct verbatim recitation from a dry and dusty schoolbook, was 
the order of the day. Drawing, now a compulsory study in every common school 
in Massachusetts, was a forbidden amusement; generally discouraged by a smart 
rap on the knuckles of the budding artist, who had his revenge through that mar- 
velous implement, the boy’s jackknife, which left its imprint on every schoolroom 
bench till the temple of knowledge seemed almost in peril of being whittled out of 
existence; while every board fence, barn side, and granite bowlder was decorated 
by an uncouth and often indecent protest against the schoolroom tyranny. 
It needed a mighty intensity of purpose behind a native longing for knowledge 
to carry such a sensitive, ambitious, and conscientious boy unharmed through the 
perilous years from 5 to 15. But he went through and came out unscathed. At 
15 he says of himself: ‘(I would as soon stick a pin in my flesh as through the 
pages of a book.” There was no ‘‘ dog-earing” or scribbling on the fly leaves of 
the few books he had earned by his winter’s straw-braiding and summer toil. His 
reverence for knowledge was like a religion. ‘‘ I looked on a young lady who had 
studied Latin as a sort of goddess.” He came up in an era of coarse animal indul- 
gence, neither drinking strong liquors, swearing, nor using tobacco. His ‘‘ boyish 
castles in the air had reference to doing something for the benefit of mankind.” 
The great conflict of his early boyhood was the protest of his preternaturally 
awakened reason and keen sense of justice against the awful theology thundered 
over his head from the pulpit of Dr. Emmons. After untold torments, at the age 
of 12 he finally broke out from this terrible spell and henceforth thought and
-P-A-G-E-804
  724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
felt his way up into a broad and catholic habit of thinking, though for many years 
in a maze of uncertainty, but never irreverent. It was well said, “ His morality 
was what other people called religion.” This ‘‘feeling after God lest haply he 
might find him” was all the more a trial from his intensely sensitive moral consti- 
tution. Horace Mann was to the last a Puritan of the Puritans; as he declares, 
“aman with a liberal creed and Calvinistic nerves.” Like the majority of bright 
boys and girls of the day, he became a schoolmaster in the district school, where 
he taught several years before entering college and during his college vacations. 
He “ fitted” for Brown University in six months, under a Mr, Barrett, apparently 
his first real teacher, and entered Brown as sophomore at the age of 20. 
But his new Jordan was a weary road. His poverty was extreme. He writes 
to his sister: ‘‘A long time since my last ninepence bade farewell to its brethren.” 
But he studied and got at money by all the ways best known to the struggling student 
of eighty years ago. He writes to the favorite sister: ‘‘ In your next letter put in 
some sentences of mother’s, just as she spoke them. Let her say something to 
me, even if it be a repetition of those old yarns—I mean if it be a repetition of the 
good motherly advice and direction, all about good character and proper behavior 
and straightforward, narrow-path conduct, such as young Timothy’s in the 
primer.” This terrible college toil, in which he won the highest honors of his 
class, graduating with a valedictory on ‘‘The progressive character of the human 
race,” was lightened by his first love for the daughter of President Messer, whom 
he married and lost after the blessedness of two years of perfect home life. His 
only.collision with the college authorities known to fame was his persistence in 
delivering an oration on a certain Fourth of July in the college chapel, captured 
and held for the Independence Day celebration by the students in the face and 
eyes of the faculty, who had closed the doors. 
On graduating he entered the law office of Hon. J. J. Fiske, in the neighboring 
town of Wrentham, but was soon called back to Brown University as tutor in 
Latin and Greek. His best scholarship was in the humanities, although his love 
for science was a deep-seated and lifelong passion, with but small opportunity of 
satisfaction. From the university he went, in 1821, at the age of 25, to the law 
school at Litchfield, Conn., presided over by Judge Gould. Among the group of 
thirty students he was by common consent distinguished as ‘‘the best fellow and 
best wit, the best whist player, the best scholar, and the best lawyer in the school.” 
He studied mental and moral philosophy, chiefly in the works of the Scotch meta- 
physicians, although in his later years stranded on the shoals of the popular fad 
of phrenology, largely through the influence of his friend Mr. George Combe, of 
Scotland, whose Destiny of Man and other works were certainly a great uplift to 
many of the earnest and thoughtful youth of the time. From the law school he - 
passed on to the law office of Hon. James Richardson, of Dedham, Mass., and in, 
1823, at the age of 27, was admitted to the bar eed began the practice of his 
profession in that town. 
Living in Dedham for ten and in Boston for fourteen years, until the age of 41, 
Horace Mann was known as a successful and very able young lawyer and a rising 
politician. His exacting and almost fastidious sense of justice kept him aloof from 
any law case that did not commend itself to his conscience, and in consequence he 
won four of every five he undertook. 
His unique faculty of public speech rapidly developed. In his arguments in 
court he always ‘endeavored to give each member of the jury something that 
could be quoted on his side in consultation.” Few of our most effective American 
public speakers have achieved his remarkable power of condensing the gist of an 
argument, or compressing the central idea of a theme into one epigrammatic sen- 
tence. And although this faculty of brilliant and epigrammatic sentence making 
is doubtless, as in Lord Macaulay, a literary defect, yet it stood the great educator 
 
-P-A-G-E-805
AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 725 
‘wellin hand while, for twenty-two years, he faced all comers, hurling at his throng 
of opponents his tremendous sentences, each like an explosive shell cast into the 
heart of a hostile camp. 
In 1824 he attracted the attention of John Quincy Adams, then in the full splen- 
dor of his latter-day service in the House of Representatives in Congress, by a 
Fourth of July oration at Dedham. In 1827, at the age of 31, he was elected from 
Dedham to the legislature of the State. For the next ten years he was greatly 
absorbed by his political duties. He at once came to the front as the most con- 
spicuous public leader in all matters concerning the higher interests of the Com- 
monwealth. His first speech was a defense of religious liberty, probably in some 
connection with the law that still compelled every citizen of Massachusetts to pay 
achurch tax, although with the privilege of deciding to what manner of church 
it should be appropriated, and the statute which up to a period near this had com- 
pelled every high official of the State to take oath to his belief in the prevailing 
theology. He also addressed and printed one of the first legislative speeches on 
the development of railroads made in the United States. He carried through the 
legislature the bill establishing the first State lunatic asylum in the country, at 
Worcester, Mass., under the efficient direction of Dr. Woodward. He was greatly 
interested in the institution for the deaf and dumb and blind then represented by 
Dr. Samuel G. Howe. He was the friend and adviser of Dorothea L. Dix, then 
entering on her memorable career as an angel of deliverance to the prisoner and 
the evangelist of peace and good will to all the oppressed, afflicted, and erring sons 
and daughters of men. His interest in the rising agitation for temperance was a 
part of his innermost life. He hated rum and tobacco with a perfect hatred, and 
it was always a trial for him to be charitable or even just to the best man who 
was addicted to their use. 
During his residence at Dedham he married a daughter of President Messer, of 
Brown University, after years of patient waiting till he could pay his college debts 
and amass a respectable competence. The death of this admirable woman, after 
a perfect married life of two years, cast the afflicted husband into a shadow land 
of deep sorrow, spiritual uncertainty, and an almost ascetic habit of life. His 
brother failed in business and involved him in financial ruin. He removed to Bos- 
ton in 1833, at the age of 87. During the four years following, already a man of 
commanding reputation in professional and public life, he lived, slept, and ate in 
his law office, sometimes unable to buy a dinner. He toiled sixteen hours a day. 
One of his earliest contributions to the public was his editorship, in connection 
with Judge Metcalf, of the revised statutes of the Commonwealth, in 1836. This 
year found him in the honorable position of president of the Massachusetts State 
senate, with every prospect of a political career that might land him in what may 
be regarded the most desirable position in the Republic, a permanent and promi- 
nent membership in the Senate of the United States. But the prodigious strain 
upon all the functions of life for twenty years had already broken the spring of 
a physical constitution of wonderful tenacity and power of rapid recuperation 
from dangerous prostration. At the age of 41 he seemed on the point of a final 
collapse of health. But above his sorely stricken, wearied, and failing body, he 
flamed out to all who knew him with that ‘radiant look” which to the end marked 
him as a revolving light flashing athwart the storm-swept sea of the tempestuous 
public life of sixty years ago. 
All this time he was ‘‘laying up treasure in heaven” through the enthusiastic 
friendship of a group of men every one of whom became in his own way a marked 
character in national affairs. Dr. Samuel G. Howe he loved as a brother. Till 
the day of his death he made the clergy somewhat responsible for the suffering of 
his youth under.the terrible ministry of old Dr. Emmons; but he sat gladly under 
the magnificent preaching of Father Taylor, for a generation the great Methodist  
-P-A-G-E-806

sailor-preacher and prophet of Boston. Of a sermon by Dr. William Ellery Chan- 
ning he wrote: ‘‘It was as though his urn had been freshly filled from a fountain 
of everlasting love.” Rev. Dr. Waterston and Rev. Samuel J. May were ministers 
after his own heart. Dr. Woodward and Dr. Todd, directors of the lunatic asy- 
lums at Worcester, Mass., and Hartford, Conn., were among his most honored 
friends. George Combe, who had come over from Scotland on a lecturing tour in 
the United States, was his lifelong correspondent and one of the few men who 
seem to have been largely influential in the development of his later philosophical 
and moral opinions. Charles Sumner was just emerging from his somewhat pro- 
tracted lingering in the delights of scholarship and foreign travel into the great 
service in the cause of freedom that ended only with the close of the civil war. 
Jonathan Phillips, Edmund Dwight, and George Darrow were fine types of the 
eminent citizenship in which the New England cities have always beon so rich— 
men of affairs who make leisure days and nights for the building of a city which 
shall be “‘set on a hill and not be hid.” Of a lecture by Ralph Waldo Emerson he 
wrote: “It was to human life what Newton’s Principia was to mathematics,” 
although Dr. Walter Channing, who sat by his side, said it made his head ache. 
But, apart from the admiration and reverence for superiority everywhere, which 
is one of the most certain tests of genius, it is hardly possible that Horace Mann 
could ever have deeply sympathized with the new transcendental philosophy then 
in favor with a large section of the cultivated class of Boston, contemporary with 
the great revival for popular education and liberal thinking in religion of which 
Mann and Channing were the leaders. 
But the time had come when it was becoming somewhat of a problem what 
should the State of Massachusetts do with sucha character as Horace Mann. His 
deep, intense, almost fanatical sense of religion and morality; his relentless habit 
of forcing every man and every subject up toa moral standard; a moral police- 
man bringing the face of every prisoner under the glare of an electric light; his 
inveterate habit of ‘‘taking no thought for his life,” according to the common 
habit of the vast majority of good men, so that the cause then on his mind and 
heart might have ‘‘free course, run, and be glorified;” his terrific power of public 
speech, joined with a singular magnetism for a large class of influential men, 
coupled with a knowledge of New England American common life surpassed by 
no man of that or any period, all marked him as one who in public affairs would 
be an unmanageable factor, not to be put aside. The great antislavery agitation 
that afterwards swept him aside from the grand work of his life into a Congres- 
sional career of six years had not yet come up into its later stage of war. What 
should be done with Horace Mann would be the most anxious thought of the 
few men and women who then represented what was so soon to become an 
“‘impending crisis ” in national affairs. 
But the appearance of such a man, so prominent that he can not be left out of 
sight of anybody when critical moral issues are involved, is in itself the most 
decisive proof that ‘‘a great and notable day of the Lord is at hand.” This tre- 
mendous education of forty-one years was but a providential training for that 
educational statesmanship which assured his leadership in the revival of the Ameri- 
can common school which was the fundamental condition of the salvation of the 
Unicn and the emergence of a new republic a generation later at the close of the 
civil war. His place was found when on July 1, 1837, Horace Mann assumed the 
duties of the board of education of Massachusetts and began a career of twenty- 
two years, memorable in the history of a State and nation: Here were a character 
and a career which have never been quite appreciated and never sufficiently hon- 
ored by those who, by their position and culture, would be expected to hail his 
coming as ‘‘a man of God sent from heaven.” 
It may be thought a strange thing that this man, to whom apparently lay open
-P-A-G-E-807
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 727 
the most flattering prospect of a public and professional career, with peculiar 
opportunities for amassing wealth and the influence of high political station to 
patronize all the popular philanthropies, should have so easily turned his back 
upon them all and gone, like a lover to his wedding, to this untried and doubtful 
position. The salary was but $1,500 a year. He had not even the official aid of a 
clerk. He writes: ‘‘ My task as yet seems incomparably great. I scarcely know 
where or in what manner to begin. I have, however, a faith, strong as prophecy, 
that much may be done.” There is no reason to doubt his own statement thatthe 
proposition to take the office of secretary of the board of education when first 
made was a complete surprise. His thoughts were running in other channels, on 
the organizations for the relief of the deaf, dumb, blind, and insane, and the new 
temperance legislation. But when seriously considered, the idea of personal sac- 
rifice does not seem to have occurred to him in view of the great opportunity of 
his life. He mentions with apparent surprise that, ‘‘ with the exception of Dr. 
Channing, every man inquired about the salary and the honor of the station.” 
The new movement of which he was the head had been born in a manger; ‘‘there 
was no room for it inthe inn.” The old Bulfinch statehouse had no corner where 
the greatest educational statesman of America could be given a chair and desk. 
He had a modest office on Tremont street, not far from the old burying grounds 
where lay the bones of the fathers of the Commonwealth, and there he lived and 
worked like a dray horse until his second marriage gave him a home. 
His first official month of July and the early weeks of August were passed in 
a country retreat with a pile of books, thinking out a way to begin. He wrote a 
long letter to Edmund Dwight, on assuming the office, giving his impressions of 
his work. The first point he seems to have noticed in looking into the early rec- 
ords of education in the colonial period was that the movement proceeded entirely 
from the Massachusetts Bay colony, the broad-minded, college-bred, and well- 
nurtured men that founded Boston and the adjacent settlements. He says of the 
Plymouth colonists: ‘‘Compared with the contemporary legislation of the Massa- 
chusetts colony, the advantage is strongly in favor of the latter. Schools seem to 
have occupied very little of their attention. Learning was not a paramount object 
of their ambition.” These Plymouth colonists were the people who came from an 
eleven years’ residence in Holland, from which we are told that the New England 
common school originated. The fact is that the New England idea of education, 
from Harvard College down to the district school, was of purely British origin; it 
was the attempt of the most intelligent section of the British Liberal party in 
church and state to plant in the vigorous soil of a new world the university and 
free school from which they had drawn their own inspiration at home, with an 
extension of the opportunity to spread the feast of knowledge before the entire 
people of the colony. The fighting property of the new secretary, which to the 
end was the breath of his life, appears at once. ‘‘I willavail myself of the oppor- 
tunity to recommend some improvements and generally to apply a flesh brush to 
the backs of the people.” 
But the frame of mind in which he entered on his great enterprise irresistibly 
rises into a solemn and enthusiastic realm. ‘‘No man can apply himself to any 
worthy subject, either of thought or action, but he will forthwith find it developed 
into dimensions and relations of which he had no conception. - How true is this 
of the all-comprehending subject of education.”” ‘“‘On the part of introducing 
apparatus and substituting real for verbal knowledge, I must endeavor to effect a 
lodgment in the public mind.” “Jf error can only be conserved, how mighty will 
it grow of itself.” ‘‘If I can be the means of ascertaining what is the best con- 
struction of schoolhouses, what are the best books, what is the best arrangement 
of studies, what are the best modes of instruction; if I can discover by what appli- 
ance and means a nonthinking, nonreflecting, nonspeaking child can most surely 
 
-P-A-G-E-808
  728 e EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
be trained into a noble citizen, ready to contend for the right and to die for the 
right; if I can only obtain and diffuse through this State a few good ideas on 
these and similar subjects, may I not flatter myself that my ministry hath not 
been wholly in vain?” ‘‘Let the next generation be my client. Let me look for- 
ward to the children of the next generation rather than to the incorrigible men of 
this.” ‘‘ When I preach, I hope I shall not forget that, however near a true man 
may get to heaven, he still retains the main part of his relations to the earth.” 
Good Jonathan Phillips sent him a present of $500. The salary fixed by the legis- 
lature, after deducting necessary expenses, left him $500 a year to live on. But 
he writes, with his peculiar humor that always carries an edge, ‘‘I will be 
revenged by doing more than $1,500 worth of good.” 
It is evident that Horace Mann went about this work to which he had been 
“called with an effectual calling” in no literary, scholarly way, or even according 
to the ordinary zeal of the educational spirit. It was to him, first of all, a work 
for the general elevation and inspiration of the people of the Commonwealth, and 
through them of the whole Republic concerning the relation of the younger third 
of the population to the general welfare, even the salvation of the State and nation 
from perils that no one saw more clearly than himself. It was evident to him 
that this was no mere professional labor of calling the attention of the people of 
Massachusetts and New England to the importance of a general enlightenment. 
Massachusetts and New England had never been indifferent to education, and 
from their earliest and feeblest beginnings as communities had cherished it as the 
apple of the eye. Nowhere in the world in 1830-1850 was there a reverence for 
distinguished ability and learning, a respect for high professional eminence, a 
habit of giving honor to superiority of character, genius, and large mental acquire- 
ments greater than was found among the ‘‘common folk” of these Common- 
wealths. Neither were Massachusetts or New England at that time destitute of 
great names. Webster and Channing and Everett and their like were at the 
height of their fame, and a group of younger celebrities in every profession were 
in training for the more exacting.days that were sure to come. But in Massa- 
chusetts and New England educational affairs were in that peculiar stata of 
transition where it was to be finally determined whether the aristocratic British 
ideal of a separate and higher culture for the well-born and well-off was to 
become the established order, or the whole people, as far as was possible, could be 
“nurtured ” together for a republican citizenship that laid on every man, however 
great and good, the Christian obligation of being the servant of all and the brother 
of his kind. 
In the days of colonial poverty and special disabilities, under the pressure of a 
chronic irritation from the heartless mother over the sea, it had been compara- 
tively easy to keep the children and youth together in the little elementary and 
free grammar schools of the day. But now, after fifty years of national life, with 
the growth of a powerful cultivated and wealthy class, the first eruption of a 
great multitude of the humbler sort from Europe already coming in like a rising 
flood, the old British conflict of the “‘ classes v. the masses” had once more arisen. 
The common schools had been permitted to fall into comparative neglect. The 
academies and colleges were regarded as the more appropriate places where the 
superior families should educate their children. The new transcendental philos- 
ophy had yet assumed no popular aspect, but rather encouraged its disciples to 
draw off into little communities or dwell apart in a scholarly and eccentric isola- 
tion that could easily nourish a proud conceit of superiority. The tremendous 
agitation among the churches inaugurated by Dr. Channing’s famous discourse 
at the ordination of the Rev. Jared Sparks in a new independent church in Balti- 
more in 1819, and the secession of a hundred. of the most powerful and influential 
of the old Puritan societies from the Congregational Evangelicism of the day,
-P-A-G-E-809
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 729 
were a fire in the bones of every little and great community in the State. The 
fury of political partisanship was at its highest pitch over the outbreak of the 
nullification movement in South Carolina, which was only compromised by spring- 
ing upon the country the conflict of financial theories which we have with us to- 
day. There was imminent danger that unless the common school could be in 
some way lifted out of the ruts, reorganized in a form to meet the demands of the 
new time and the more cultivated and influential class, its teachers trained not 
to be ashamed to look in the face of a college professor or the reverend principal 
of a denominational academy, the country schoolhouse made the most instead of 
the least attractive place for the children and youth, the people of all sorts and 
conditions awakened as by a thunderstorm of remonstance, warning, and appeal 
to the peril of a society where a highly trained and ambitious minority should 
dominate an ignorant and quarrelsome majority, there was everything to be 
feared ahead. 
No specialist, however earnest and eloquent, like Carter or Brooks; no scholar 
like Barnard, learned in all the wisdom of the educators of every land, no great 
teacher like Emerson, Kingsbury, or Wayland could now fill the scene. It was 
not so much a work of pedagogic enlightenment as of a high educational states- 
manship, looking before and after, adapting the present conditions to the new 
possibilities of the Commonwealth and the nation, that under the modest title of 
secretary of the Massachusetts board of education challenged Horace Mann, woke 
him up to the first real consciousness of his own peculiar genius, revealed the pos- 
sibilities of an original career, and summoned him as commander-in-chief of a great 
host. to a conflict that would outlast his day, in which the victory could only be 
won when the Republic should be all free and the people of one mind go on to 
the making of the model nation of the earth. 
His brief month of August in the country, buried in piles of documents, was all 
the preparation vouchsafed to the secretary for the beginning of his great work 
in the early days of autumn. Meanwhile the board of education had issued an 
address to the people of the State, inviting a series of popular conventions of edu- 
cators and friends of the common school for general discussion, promotinga mutual 
acquaintance, obtaining information, and recommending some practical measures 
for advancing the good cause. The secretary was expected to attend all these 
meetings with the members of the board and as many of the distinguished men of 
the State of all professions as could be interested in the movement. Attention was 
called in this address to the condition of the schoolhouses, to the duties and com- 
pensation of school committees, the training of teachers, the establishment of 
district school libraries, and to a uniform series of schoolbooks as fit topics of 
discussion in these gatherings. 
In addition to this method of ascertaining the actual condition of common- 
school affairs in the State, the secretary was directed to collate the reports of 
nearly 300.towns and cities on the state of education, containing the local details 
of the past year. This practice had been established a few years before, and a 
somewhat unsatisfactory series of abstracts had been prepared by the secretary 
of state. But Mr. Mann at once saw a great opportunity in this method of setting 
before the people the actual state of public education. Under his hands, after sev- 
eral months of incessant labor, his first Abstract of School Reports came forth, an 
intensely interesting volume, containing not only the statistics but the remarks 
and suggestions of the school committees. Its appearance was a cause of humili- 
ation and hope—humiliation at the low average of popular education; hope in the 
great intelligence and good spirit displayed in many of the good suggestions of 
the local committees. The fact that there was now a commander in chief of 
the educational army awoke the same enthusiasm as the appointment of a Wash- 
ington or a Grant to the command of a soldiery dispirited by feeble leadership

and constant defeat. At once the best men in every town, who had been discour- 
aged by the almost hopeless condition of educational affairs, took heart and con- 
sented again to serve on school committees and give their best thought to their 
official duties and their experience to the preparation of their annual reports. 
This series of abstracts, half a dozen in number, prepared with great care and 
incredible labor almost entirely by Mr. Mann, are among the most reliable educa- 
tional documents in American official literature. The final result of this practice 
was the passage of a law requiring the school committee of every town and city 
in the State to issue an annual printed report to be forwarded to the State board 
of education. These reports, more than 300 in number, are now bound into stout 
volumes and offer to any inquirer into the present condition of school affairs the 
best means of obtaining information and of reading the words of a great variety 
of workers in every department of the schools in all sorts of communities. It was 
the most practical way of beginning the arduous work of the secretary, uncover- 
ing the actual status of the common school and popular education, and is now 
largely adopted by the school authorities of the country. 
The preparation of this first abstract of reports seems to have suggested the 
fourfold method of dealing with the public to which Mr. Mann adhered with a 
marvelous and persistent industry and a complete success during his entire term 
of service of twelve years. 
1. The abstract should be used as a method of placing before the public the 
annual condition of school affairs, not only what was being accomplished, but 
what the school committees, who were the motive power of the system, were 
thinking, feeling, and proposing to do. 
2. In his own annual reports he began that elaborate discussion of the funda- 
mentals of universal education which lifted this official communication out of 
the dry and dusty monotony of a formal public document to a positive addition 
to the literature of the American common school. These ten reports by the secre- 
tary followed each other in stately procession, each better than the last, the entire 
collection making one of the most notable series of powerful and suggestive writ- 
ing on the general theme of public education ever given to any country. They 
became a model for this department of educational literature. Mr. Mann was 
followed in the West by the annual reports of the superintendent of St. Louis, 
Mo., and later Hon, William H. Ruffner, first State superintendent of schools in 
Virginia, followed in the same track and published a series of remarkable docu- 
ments that declared him the Horace Mann of the new educational South. 
8. For the wider dissemination of these reports, the publication of, interesting 
information, and the discussion of methods of school organization, discipline, and 
instruction the Common School Journal was established and published ten years. 
It was edited by Mr. Mann as a personal contribution to education, in no way 
pretending to represent the opinions of the State board of education and inviting 
awide range of discussion. It never paid its way as a pecuniary venture, and the 
editor received no return in money for the days and nights expended upon it. In 
this bimonthly journal is to be found a great deal of the secretary’s most racy and 
suggestive writing, often going into the most homely details of school life, 
broaching ideas, methods, and ways and means that have become the common- 
place of public-school administration. There is little at the present time in any 
department of our public instruction that was not suggested in that epigrammatic 
and intense style of his, which gave to every sentence the Jife and soul of his own 
eloquent spoken words. 
4, But the spoken word was always a mighty power with Horace Mann. His 
lectures before the educational conventions that were at once called and grew up 
during his administration, published by order of the board, are still unrivaled in 
their combination of a broad and statesmanlike treatment of the entire subject, 
 
-P-A-G-E-811
  
AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 731 
with the most elaborate detail, splendor and pertinence of illustration, and skillful 
manipulation of the common facts of the everyday life of the child and the com- 
munity by which he is environed. Theodore Parker said, ‘A New England 
audience must be treated to a good deal of logic and plenty of statistics to be 
greatly moved by a public speaker.” The skeleton of every lecture delivered by 
Horace Mann, and every lecture or speech, whatever its title, had education for 
its theme, was just this masterly array of statistics, bound together by a relent- 
less chain of logic. Yet all was clothed upon by a body of splendid rhetoric, 
enlivened by a grim humor that turned to his opponent a keen edge of satire, 
often lifted into the highest realm of eloquence by a religious, moral, and patriotic 
enthusiasm that declared him one of the greatest preachers of his day, the com- 
peer if not the rival of Parker and Beecher as a true minister of the religion of 
love to God and man. 
5. In addition to all these agencies, his correspondence was enormous in quan- 
tity and of a rare quality, which, even as it appears in the brief memoir prepared 
by his wife, only stimulates and exasperates the desire for more. In these letters 
he literally poured forth his innermost heart and soul and mind and strength 
into the listening ear of his correspondent. Our own large acquaintance with the 
elderly school men of the South has offered numerous interesting illustrations of 
this habit. A correspondence with gentlemen in New Orleans, La., was the ocea- 
sion of sending Mr. A. J. Shaw, who had done reliable service in the legislature 
of Massachusetts at a critical period in the early administration of Mr. Mann, to 
that city and the establishment, with remarkable success, of the first system of 
public instruction in the Southwest. The third United States Commissioner of 
Education, Hon. N. H.R. Dawson, of Alabama, ascribed his early interest in pub- 
lic schools to the correspondence of Horace Mann with his father. 
6. Most striking of all the methods of promoting the cause was the tremendous 
power of controversy, in which all the personal force, and sometimes the red-hot 
fire of the flaming indignation of his Puritan nature, raged like the eruption of a 
volcano. It was soon made evident to him that in undertaking to magnify the 
common school of his native Commonwealth he ran right into a hornet’s nest of 
highly influential people, who at heart were thoroughly skeptical of American 
institutions, and preferred the British or Continental European schemes of edu- 
cation, not so much from their knowledge of any special superiority, but because 
they were the methods of an aristocratic or imperial régime. There was also an 
early demonstration of severe theological and ecclesiastical criticism, almost 
amounting to persecution, from one quarter on the charge of secularizing, and 
from the opposite direction of forcing sectarian religion into the schools. The 
great Catholic controversy on this matter had not yet taken form in Massachu- 
setts. But there was enough of partisan religious jealousy of the influence of the 
State board of education and the rising power of its restless and imperious secre- 
tary. Later still, thirty-one grammar-school masters of Boston attacked him in 
solid column, evidently with an honest opinion that he was undermining the 
cause of sound education; but, perhaps, as the anticipation of a searching review 
of the condition of the grammar schools of the city, after an examination ordered 
by the public authorities, and conducted by experts like Dr. 8. G. Howe, Judge 
Parsons, and Counselor Charles G. Loring. 
In all these and similar cases he swept the field and overwhelmed his assailants 
by a combination of facts and figures, logic, sentiment, and satire heated red-hot 
and projected as from the crater of a volcano. In his subsequent career of six 
years in Congress, amid the fearful excitements of the period approaching the out- 
break of the civil war, this habit became even more pronounced, and, as in his 
assault on Daniel Webster and his terrible wrestling match of controversy with 
Mr. Wendell Phillips, impaired his public influence and reacted on his temper and
-P-A-G-E-812
  182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97 
faith, as any excess in the expression even of elevated motives and philanthropic 
and patriotic sentiments is certain to do. 
But through all these and other methods of the promulgation of his deep con- 
viction ‘‘that the common school is the greatest discovery ever made by man” 
did the leader of the great revival of the American common school through the 
twelve tremendous years of this service of the Commonwealth and the country 
adhere to Napoleon’s maxim, ‘‘ When you want to do an important thing in 
public affairs, let alone the leaders and go direct to the people.” The reading of 
the thousands of pages of the published works of Horace Mann leaves us far away 
from the habit of appeal to parties, legislatures, leaders of influence, or even cele- 
brated scholars and experts which vitiates so much of the educational literature 
of our own day. He took his cause into the open forum of the people, ‘‘ spoke 
right out in meetin’” of what he did not believe, and made every earnest parent 
and bright school boy and girl the confidant of his noblest aspirations and most 
sacred convictions. 
And no educational man of the country has succeeded more completely in secur- 
ing the cooperation of so much of the eminent ability, influence, and worth of his 
own Commonwealth as Horace Mann. A valuable library might be collected of 
the admirable popular addresses, editorial writings, legislative speeches, sermons, 
and special reports with which the people of Massachusetts were literally deluged 
in the years between 1837 and 1850, One convention in Plymouth County was 
addressed by John Quincy Adams and Daniel Webster and closed by a thunder- 
ing lecture from the secretary in the evening. At Charlestown, Dr. George Put- 
nam and Rey. Caleb Stetson, the greatest preacher and the first clerical wit of the 
day, Robert Rantoul, jr., George H. Hilliard, and George B. Emerson discussed 
the most interesting questions of school management and moral instruction. At 
Pittsfield the secretary and Governor Briggs were first on the ground at a called 
meeting, swept and dusted out the audience room, arranged the seats, and ‘‘let 
themselves go” so vigorously upon the people who came that, as Mr, Mann wrote 
in his journal, ‘‘at the close the audience dispersed like a flock of birds that had 
been shot into.” While some of these conventions were numerously attended, in 
other portions of the State the secretary found an indifference that woke up his 
fiery indignation. He writes: ‘‘I would as soon try to impress that. community as 
to batter down Gibraltar with my fist.” ‘The darkness of that town is so dense 
that it puts out the light before it can reach it.” ‘‘I shook the mud of that place 
off my feet.” In one city, spending a dismal Saturday and Sunday, he reports: 
“I was cheated in their shops, spit upon in their hotels, and damned in their 
churches.” But he kept at it all the time. He writes: “If I were not proof 
against injustice, malignity, and misrepresentation, I should abandon the cause in 
despair.” ‘If the First Cause has doomed our enterprise, I give it up; but until 
I know that, I hold on.” 
Governor Edward Everett, Hon. Robert ©. Winthrop, Dr. William E. Chan- 
ning, George 8S. Hilliard, Dr. J. G. Palfrey, indeed almost every man of real emi- 
nence in the Commonwealth, responded to this voice of mighty cheer summoning 
to the good fight against the conservatism that would sacrifice the highest welfare 
of the whole people to the glorification of a superior class which, at best, could 
only be a feeble imitation of an Old-Word aristocracy. In 1839 he made the first 
of his numerous visitations outside the State, by which he so widely extended his 
acquaintance and enlarged hisinformation. Thus, at the age of 48, he first visited 
Washington, D.C. He went to Cincinnati, Ohio, and held high counsel with 
Nathan Guilford, one of the founders of the common school of Ohio; visited old 
Governor William Henry Harrison in his home at North Bend, and returned from 
a 8,000-mile outing all alive for better home work. He was in perfect accord with 
Henry Barnard, John R. Page, Francis Dwight, Calvin B. Stowe, and all the 
leaders in the new kingdom of God that was coming to the children.
-P-A-G-E-813
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 733 
‘And his work was not in vain. It is easier now than at that time to see this, 
obscured as it was by the toil and dust of a public service that was a perpetual 
conflict. His impatience, disgust, and despondency were often the inevitable result 
of his constant weariness. His health was always on the verge of a collapse, and 
he wrought at his great reports, abstracts, and lectures often in a feebleness of 
body and oppression of soul that might well have courted the relief of death. But 
despite all hindrances the grand work went steadily on. With the exception of 
the declaration of war by the thirty-one Boston grammar-school masters a few 
years later, after his report on the German schools and the teasing criticism of a 
portion of the religious press, he rarely was antagonized by one of the great men 
of his State or encountered any combination of the academical or coliege interest 
in any organized opposition. The legislature responded reasonably to his sugges- 
tions and during the first year of his administration passed a law increasing the 
compensation of school committees and enacted the statute establishing district- 
school libraries, which the secretary declared the most important law since the 
original enactment of 1647, which founded the American common school in the 
colony of Massachusetts Bay. 
Before the first eventful year of his service had expired good Edmund Dwight 
made the gift of $10,000 to establish two State normal schools, on condition that 
the legislature would duplicate the same. On July 3, 1838, on Lexington Green, 
where ‘‘ was fired the shot heard round the world,” amid a pouring rain, half a 
dozen young people appeared, and under the lead of ‘‘ Father Pierce,” a distin- 
guished teacher from Nantucket, organized the first State normal school in 
America. A second school, at Barre, in the interior of the State, was established 
later in the same year. Soon afterwards this school was removed to Westfield, in 
western Massachusetts, the Lexington normal to West Newton, and a third was 
set up at Bridgewater. The experiment of educating teachers. in private acade- 
mies subsidized by the State had already been tried at large expense with unsatis- 
factory results in New York. In New England several attempts to maintain a 
private normal school had only confirmed the most thoughtful educators of the 
day in the opinion that only in a system of professional schools supported by the 
State or a municipality, exclusively devoted to pedagogics and supplemented by 
institutes for teachers, was there any reliable assurance of elevating the standard 
of teaching in the people’s schools. Mr. Mann persuaded his wealthy friends to 
give their money for the experiment of the teachers’ institute and often spent 
liberally himself for the same cause, It appeared after his death that from his 
own small private means, assisted by Principal Pierce and other good friends of 
the cause, he really secured the establishment of these first schools and enabled 
them, under the skillful management of Pierce, May, Davis, and Tillinghast, to 
become a model for the country. 
In 1889 the legislature enacted a law fixing a six months’ term as the minimum 
of the district school through the Commonwealth. And still the great secretary 
goes toiling and thundering on, like a mighty express train laden with precious 
freight and brilliant schemes for the future. When Hon. Marcus Morton was 
finally chosen governor of the State by a majority of one vote and it appeared that 
the administration and the legislature were to be forced to a final decision 
whether the board of education and its restless secretary should be suppressed, he 
writes: ‘First, I will try to conquer; but if conquest is impossible, then I will try 
to bear.” ‘‘Persevere, persevere, and so on, a thousand times, and ten thousand 
times ten thousand.” 
In 1839 the decisive conflict came. A majority of the committee on education 
in the house of representatives of the legislature reported a bill abolishing the 
board of education, the secretaryship, and-the normal schools. An eccentric, 
enthusiastic, and magnetic popular leader, Rev. Alvin A. Dodge, of Hamilton, 
presented the argument against the whole idea and scheme of Horace Mann ina
-P-A-G-E-814
  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
written report and the accompanying speech. Fifty years later the same material 
was elaborated by his niece, the brilliant Gail Hamilton (Abigail Dodge), into a 
stout volume, written in wholesale disparagement of the American common 
school as reorganized by Horace Mann. This report was ably controverted by 
the minority of the committee, under the lead of Mr. A. I. Shaw, who afterwards 
established the common schools of New Orleans, La. The secretary himself took 
a full hand in the discussion after a fashion so effective that, some ten years ago, 
a member of the Massachusetts legislature was discovered voting steadily against 
every appropriation for the common schools of the State on the ground that fifty 
years before Horace Mann had so brought his father in the legislature under the 
flail of his terrible rhetoric and sarcasm that he could not do otherwise. 
But the effort was a conspicuous failure, although it seems incredible to-day 
that 182 members of an intelligent legislative body in Massachusetts could have 
been induced to array themselves against the children’s right to good schools, 
while 245 members stood up firmly for education. A subsequent attempt to 
transfer the duties of the board of education and the secretary’s office, as in New 
York in 1822, to the secretary of state, met a similar fate and was the final defeat 
of the anti-common school faction in the Commonwealth. From that day, now 
fifty-nine years, the legislature of Massachusetts has stood firm as a rock on that 
questicn, always ready to adopt any proposition that could be shown to be a posi- 
tive advance in the educational life of the State. 
The new legislature of 1840 was more favorable than ever. It voted an appro- 
priation of $6,000 a year for a term of years to the State normal schools. It also 
offered $15 a year to any school district that would duplicate the sum for a school 
library. The one mistake in this important movement, almost forced upon the 
management by the persistent assaults upon the board of education by certain 
clerical opponents of the secretary insisting that sectarian publications were 
included in the selection of books, was the attempt to prepare a library of 50 vol- 
umes written or adapted to the supposed wants of children. 
But the reports of the secretary were everywhere read; 18,000 copies of one of 
them were reprinted in New York. They were translated into German and read 
with admiration in the highest educational circles abroad. He had created anew 
educational literature. Almost for the first time the reader of ordinary intelli- 
gence could listen with patience to an address on education or sit down to a pub- 
lic-school report with a feeling that he must read it through at the cost of an 
invasion of the small hours of the morning. The omnipresent secretary seemed to 
have his hand in every generous man’s pocket in behalf of the good cause. Mr. 
Brimmer gave $1,500 to send a copy of the essay ‘‘ School and schoolmaster” to 
every school district in the State. Meanwhile Mr. Mann was printing large edi- 
tions of his own speeches at his own expense; never permitting himself to address 
a personal document at the cost of postage to the State; through his entire term 
of service maintaining a fastidious and almost fanatical ideal of official honesty 
and fidelity. Until his second marriage, to Miss Mary Peabody, a sister of the 
celebrated woman educator, Elizabeth Peabody, and of the accomplished wife of 
Nathaniel Hawthorne, he lived in his office after a fashion rather becoming the 
member of an ascetic religious order or a State prisoner on short rations than as 
became the dignity and comfort of the foremost popular educator in the world. 
During these twelve years of almost slavish toil and perpetual conflict with the 
enemies of the people’s school, he paid off the indebtedness forced upon him by the 
failure of a relative. After his marriage he established a home in a mortgaged 
house in the then beautiful suburban village of West Newton. A great deal of 
his work was done there, for it was not till the administration of his successor, 
Dr. Barnas Sears, that it seems to have occurred to the legislature of Massachu- 
setts to add to the office of the secretary that of State librarian, and to give the
-P-A-G-E-815
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 735 
chief of the vast educational interest of the Commonwealth a right to sit in an 
official chair under the statehouse dome. 
The summer of 1843 completed the first half of the twelve years’ service of 
Horace Mann as secretary of the Massachusetts board of education. On May 1 of 
that year he married Miss Mary Peabody. His health was again at one of those 
critical points that occurred with fatal periodicity during his entire educational 
career, the last twenty-two years of his life. He decided to visit Europe, at his 
own expense, ostensibly to recruit his wasted bodily vigor. But, as his friend 
Dr. 8. G. Howe said, ‘‘His mind went of itself.” The contemplated bridal tour 
abroad turned out one of the most laborious periods of work in his entire official 
life, a daily examination of the schools and public institutions of Great Britain 
and Germany, with his accomplished wife as an assistant. The work was com- 
plicated by his small speaking knowledge of the German and French languages, 
as he was compelled to depend largely on interpreters for conversation, although 
he could read public documents and general literature therein. But no man ever 
saw and felt more of what was about him than the secretary. 
It would seem well at this point to ‘‘take account of stock” and try to ascer- 
tain what were the peculiar methods of operation by which Horace Mann awoke 
such a marvelous interest far beyond the borders of New England, and what 
practical results had so far been realized from his influence over school men and 
legislators. This seems to us the more important, since.a full third of our own 
country is to-day in an educational situation in many ways resembling the con- 
dition of New England and the entire North sixty years ago. In the sixteen 
States of the South the common school has been established within the swift thirty 
years since the close of the civil war in a manner that has challenged the admira- 
tion of the educational public at home and abroad. But to-day the South finds 
itself at a most important crisis of its educational history. In New England and 
the North in 1830-1850 enough had been done to settle the question that these 
States had finally indorsed the American system of common schools as the per- 
manent method of training their entire population for American citizenship. 
But as Horace Mann, in 1837, found the common-school system of Massachusetts 
entirely inadequate to meet the demand of that early day, so the foremost edu- 
cators of the Southern States are now asking, How shall the new common school, 
through a region as large as Central Europe, inhabited by 25,000,000 people, three- 
fourths of whom are still living in a sparsely settled rural country, with little 
surplus of earnings or savings to spare, with open and secret enemies of popular 
education on every hand, already the legislatures of several States showing signs 
of a reactionary policy, be taken in hand and lifted up to a state even approach- 
ing that of New England and the North, so that the entire benefit of this method 
of public education may be realized? There is no better answer to this question 
than to study attentively the record of the ideas, plans, and policy of Horace 
Mann during the first six years of hisadministration. During that period he had 
not only made manifest the spirit he was of and what should be the manner of 
man to lead a great revival of popular education, but he had shown by what 
minute, painstaking, and gradual steps, against what vexatious, even exasperat- 
ing, opposition, in constant peril of fatal reactions, the great and good work not 
only went on, but obtained that momentum on which every great public tendency 
in a country like ours must finally rely for permanent success through a long 
period of years. 
We can easily see that the task set to himself by the secretary was twofold. 
First, a great revival of attention and enthusiastic interest in the common school 
idea must be awakened in all classes; not alone in the lower stratum of popula- 
tion which was constitutionally indifferent or hostile, but among the educated, 
wealthy, and influential class whose sympathies were half alienated from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-816
  736 EDUCATION ‘REPORT, 1896-97. 
people’s university and seemed on the point of falling back on the old British way of 
a separate scheme of culture for their own families. Second, as this campaign of 
education should proceed, he labored to the end that the attention and interest of 
the lawmaking power should be awakened and concentrated up to the point of a 
revision of the school laws of the Commonwealth that amounted to a complete 
reorganization of the present system. 
And this, from 1830 to 1850, was a work of peculiar delicacy and difficulty; for the 
intense individuality of the New England character and the peculiar organization 
of its public township life, with a constitutional abhorrence of the concentration 
of power, made this work of reorganization almost ‘‘a war of posts,” each of 350 
obstinate towns and cities to be besieged and captured in succession. And the 
deepest depth of this tendency had been reached by the law which made each one 
of some 3,000 school districts a corporation, practically all-powerful to determine 
the vital condition of its school. To put on the ground an organization, not at 
once, but by patient working through a generation, that would ‘smoke out” these 
little district school communities from “the hiding place of their power” might 
have taxed the executive genius of a far less impatient reformer than Horace 
Mann. But by the wonderful combination of faculties in which no American edu- 
cator has been his equal the great revival was set in motion, the machinery was 
carefully manipulated, and the tracks of influence surveyed by which the good 
work went on with never a serious backset from the last year of his service to the 
present day. 
We have already seen with what an almost incredible energy of purpose, fertility 
of resource, and unconquerable patience he organized the forces of the great 
revival. He was master of half a dozen separate methods of appeal to different 
classes of the people. By attracting to his cause the men of the highest ability 
and culture most held in esteem by the whole people of the Commonwealth, by his 
own Common School Journal and the constant use of the press, by turning the new 
lecture system into an agency of educational reform through the village lyceum 
which already blazed with the discussion of common-school affairs in every town 
in the State, was the public not only awakened but kept more alive year by year. 
Never was a Commonwealth in Christendom more thoroughly besieged, bom- 
barded, overwhelmed as by a cyclone of agitation than Massachusetts during the 
twelve years of the administration of Horace Mann. The office of secretary of the 
board of education was like a central public school room, agitating the people, 
continually reporting and suggesting methods of reform to the legislature, yet with 
no legal power to act. But when the first Massachusetts board of education called 
Horace Mann to his place, its members knew just what they were about. Here was 
aman who not only would faithfully perform the legal duties of his office to the 
very letter, but, above and beyond, would magnify the office itself and tower aloft, 
shining everywhere, make himself the vital public center of every organization, a 
tower of flame in the far-away East, seen from every corner of the Republic. 
For twelve years he so dominated the State, so compelled everybody to follow 
or fight him, that it required ten years of the comparatively mild administration 
of his successors, Sears and Boutwell, for a rest before the vigorous administra- 
tion of Joseph White and the long and splendid service of John W. Dickinson 
could bring the educational affairs of the State to their present high position. As 
in Southey’s poem, ‘‘ The Curse of Kehama,” the Prince of Darkness is represented 
as storming a city over a score of avenues from every point of the compass, so the 
opponent of Horace Mann knew not whither to go, for he was met by some new 
incarnation of his terrible energy at every turn of every road. 
But the progress of actual reform was not at any such rate of velocity. In fact, 
we have seen that the second year of his administration was largely occupied in 
manipulating the legislature to resist a desperate effort to repeal the entire system
-P-A-G-E-817
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. T3T 
and abolish the secretary himself. But this victory was final, and one measure 
after another was carried, each a foundation stone in the reorganized common 
school. 
1. First of all, the board, under the leadership of its secretary, ordered an 
abstract of the common-school reports of all the towns and cities of the Common- 
wealth made for the information of the people. It was already the duty of the 
secretary of state to do this work, but the secretary of the board relieved that 
official of his duty, and year by year launched upon the public a series of 
“Abstracts” that opened the dullest eyes and awakened the apprehensions of the 
most confident concerning the true state of educational affairs. It seemed as if 
nothing was right and as if each department of public education was a little 
worse off than its neighbor. The board called attention to the disgraceful condi- 
tion of schoolhouses in so many of the districts that it seemed a common evil; to 
the lack of preparation by teachers, and the consequent poverty of the instruc- 
tion; to the uncertainty of school attendance, one-third of the children between 
5 and 15 being constantly out of school; to the chronic neglect of school commit- 
tees toattend to their duty of the examination of teachers, visitation of schools, 
and superintendence of schoolbooks, of which three hundred sorts were in use in 
the State; to the irresponsible and often half-barbarous methods of discipline, 
including corporal punishment as a steady régime. All these things revealed 
a confirmed common-school habit, by the indifference of one and the neglect 
and opposition of another section of the people, who should work together for the 
common good of the children and the State. 
The first year was spent largely by the secretary in visits through the State, 
chiefly at his own expense, addressing conventions, often little squads of hearers, 
but all the time getting at the influential people of every community, devising 
ways and means and methods of work. Especially did he work upon the real 
motive power of the whole machine, the town school committee. This was the 
only system of school supervision on the ground, a body of three, or some multiple 
of three, men elected in town meeting or in cities by popular vote, working with 
no adequate compensation, on whom was cast the delicate and laborious duties 
included in the present elaborate scheme of city and district superintendency. By 
legislative enactment he caused the salary of these officials to be raised, and labored 
with all his might to overthrow the mischievous arrangement of separate districts, 
of which he said: ‘‘I consider the law of 1789, authorizing towns to divide them- 
selves into districts, the most unfortunate law on the subject of common schools 
ever enacted in the State.” His whole contention was to gather up this wide, 
extended, shapeless tangle of a district school system, responsible to nobody out 
of eyeshot, jealous as death of town authority, and rebellious of State control, 
into a compact body, not by the European fashion of the imposition of a power 
from above, but by the intelligent control of the whole people. For twelve years 
Horace Mann was virtually superintendent of schools in every town and city of 
the State; never more c. than when the thirty-one grammar schoolmasters of 
Boston organized a teachers’ rebellion and were thrashed into subjection by their 
mighty master, representing the outraged public opinion of the city and State. 
But it was not till the power of his great personality was removed in 1850 that 
school superintendency even of Boston was enacted by law. And until 1859 the 
district system maintained a losing fight against being merged into the town of 
which it was a part. To-day nine-tenths of the children of the State are under a 
local or district supervision, besides enjoying the constant inspection and advice 
of the expert agents of the State board of education. 
2. The State school fund had already been created on paper, in 1834, with the 
proviso that it be raised to $1,000,000 from the sale of public lands in Maine and 
other sources. The board of education was now intrusted with the care and dis- 
ED 97-47  
-P-A-G-E-818
  738 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tribution of the income of this fund, which, from giving one-half to the city of 
Boston in 1835, through a series of changes and experiments made in 1849 was 
apportioned to the towns and cities according to their number of persons between 
the ages of 5and 15, om condition that each should raise $1.50 for the annual 
schooling of each child of school age. Subsequent changes considerably enlarged 
this fund and diverted a large portion of its income to the support of the State 
normal schools, the agencies of the board and a moderate subsidy to the poorer 
class of towns asia relief from their necessity of extreme taxation for education. 
For local taxation is the mainspring of the Massachusetts system of public instruc- 
tion, and $9,000,000 of the $10,000,000 now annually expended for common schools 
in Massachusetts is obtained in this way. 
3. As early as 1827 a sharp summons from Governor Levi Lincoln to the legis- 
lature on the decline of common-school education in the State had been followed 
by a spasmodic but fruitless attempt to establish a ‘‘literary fund” for the sup- 
port of a system of training teachers and the general betterment of the common 
schools. But not till 1838, under the powerful stimulus of the first report of 
Horace Mann, were the first State normal schools in the Union set up.. Eyen this 
was only achieved by the timely gift of a private citizen, who contributed half 
the sum necessary for the venture, while Mr. Mann had sold his law library to 
furnish the building at Lexington and made a second contribution by mortgaging 
his own house to complete the buildings given by Josiah Quincy, jr., to receive 
the same school on its removal to West Newton and to complete the building of 
the third normal at Bridgewater. The heart and soul of the secretary went out 
into these new schools for the training of the teachers. He searched the State as 
with a lighted candle for their fit principals, and in Pierce, May, and Tillinghast 
found the right men for the right place, although he carried on a friendly but 
earnest controversy with Sam. J. May, lest he should turn the Lexington normal 
school into a seminary for the propagation of the antislavery gospel, of which 
the secretary himself, out of office, was one of the most enthusiastic disciples. 
These normal schools were the first opportunity the State of Massachusetts had 
granted to its young women for a free education of the upper, secondary, and 
higher sort, and within ten years there came forth from them a group of young 
women graduates whose reputation as teachers and supervisors of schools was 
acknowledged through every section of the country. The secretary also, during 
his first year of service, organized the primary woman teachers of Boston, always 
loyal to him, into an association for mutual improvement by study and lectures. 
He caused the best works. on education to be distributed in every school district 
through libraries and by special gifts. In 1837 the Middlesex County and in 1845 
the State teachers’ conventions were organized. This good work was favored by 
the legislature, which for more than fifty years aided these conventions and the 
American Institute of Instruction established in 1830 by an annual subsidy of 
$300. These conventions were not only made an occasion for large popular gather- 
ings, but were a great aid to the:teachers. In 1846 the teachers’ institutes were 
first established. in the State, Mr. Mann teaching in them alone days in succession. 
The Common School Journal, edited by the secretary and for ten years published 
on his sole responsibility, was a model of educational journalism, and was cireu- 
lated far beyond the borders of the State. The result of this soul-wearying labor 
in the day of small things is seen in the present elaborate system of State and city 
normal schools, institutes, Chautauqua, and other summer arrangements which 
extend to every section of the Union. 
4, One of the most serious evils encountered at the outset of his administration 
by the secretary was the irregularity of attendance and short school terms in 
many portions of the State. One-third of the children of Massachusetts between 
5 and 15 were in no school. Multitudes only drifted in and out of inferior private

or were able to get three summer or two or three winter months in public 
schools. In 1839 the law was passed which required a six-months school, continu- 
ous or divided into two terms, as a minimum of free public education in every dis- 
trict. The same law provided for a female assistant to every school of more than 
fifty pupils. But the teachers were still elected by the ‘‘ prudential committees” 
of the separate districts, until in 1844 this power was partially, as it was later 
fully, restored to the school committees. The statute compelling the teacher to 
file a certificate of examination before receiving his salary corrected an abuse that 
will everywhere prevail while the office of rural teacher is at the mercy of a per- 
sonal favoritism most injurious to the public welfare. Already, in 1827, the excel- 
lent law making the establishment of a free English high school compulsory on 
every town of 500 families (2,500 people) and of a classical high school in every 
town of 4,000 people had been placed on the statute book, Massachusetts is still 
the only American Commonwealth that in this way makes the secondary educa- 
tion now compulsory on all her population, a fashion which has not only been of 
immense value to the State, but has so advanced the reputation of Massachusetts 
in the upper side of public and private instruction that the income from the tui- 
tion and living of persons coming to the State to attend the secondary, higher, and 
professional schools is to-day many fold the outlay of the half million expended 
on the 30,000 free high-school pupils at home. To-day every child in Massachu- 
setts has the right to forty weeks a year, for three or four years, in a free English 
or classical high school. 
5, In 1837, although by law the school committees were authorized to select the 
text-books and arrange the courses of study in all the public schools, the statute 
‘was more honored in the breach than in the observance.” The secretary found 
three hundred different sets of schoolbooks in use in the State. He labored with 
all his might to introduce order in this realm of dire confusion and did succeed 
beyond expectation. He brought in not only the present arrangement of a rea- 
sonable uniformity of text-books, but encouraged the introduction of a better 
quality. Some of these which came up at this date under his encouragement are 
still among the best in any language. To-day all text-books and material for 
school work are free to every child of the State. The books are purchased by the 
schooi authorities and loaned to the children, who are thereby taught the valuable 
lesson that came to young Horace Mann by instinct, ‘‘ that he would as soon stick 
a pin into his own flesh as into a page of a book.” His writings are full of the 
advocacy of oral and personal instruction, and long before his visit to Germany 
he had suggested nearly all the improved methods of approaching the mind of the 
child, with the emphatic indorsement of the woman teacher in elementary instruc- 
tion, that have so mightily changed the aspect of the primary schoolroom within 
one generation. 
6. One of the first reports of the secretary was devoted to the improvement of 
schoolhouses. It would be impossible to believe the accounts of the condition of 
the public schoolhouse in many communities of New England, sometimes even in 
the larger towns, were it not confirmed by the testimony of people who, like the 
author of this essay, have been the victims of the chronic neglect and indifference 
of the average American community of that date to the condition of the children 
in those old ‘‘ temples of science.” With a surprising wealth of information and 
the entire resources of his matchless eloquence, persuasion, and satire did the sec- 
retary assail this conspiracy against the children in the public schoolhouse. The 
result was that within two years of his appeal to the people $500,000, and during 
the twelve years of his administration $1,000,000, had been expended, not in expen- 
sive city temples, but in the construction or improvement of a great number of 
country and village school buildings. A course of Mr. Mann’s illustrated lectures, 
with stereopticon views of the outside and inside of the old-time American school-  
-P-A-G-E-820
  740 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
house, would be one of the most popular entertainments of the day. The fact 
that our American common-school teachers never had the European habit of liv- 
ing in houses provided by the State, indeed were largely drawn from the younger 
stratum of the population, and often, in the old time, ‘‘ boarded round ” in the 
families of the district or were cared for in some temporary place, may have told 
on the structure of the schoolhouse. The poverty of fit sanitary arrangements 
and the deficiencies, often the intolerable discomfort, of the average school- 
room of that period would be almost incredible to the children of the present 
city schools, who are often largely of foreign birth and from humble homes, but 
who guard their schoolhouse and grounds as carefully as if they were in a crystal 
palace. Would that Horace Mann could now revisit the scene of his labors and 
be led from one beautiful and convenient schoolhouse to another till he felt that 
coming back to his own dear Commonwealth and the country he loved so well 
was like a welcome to one of the ‘‘many mansions” reserved for the faithful in 
the life eternal. 
7. We have already seen how young Horace Mann appreciated and used the 
little public library given by Dr. Benjamin Franklin to the Massachusetts town 
named from himself. It was the passion of his life to bring the opportunity of 
good reading to all the children and youth. In 1837 probably not one-sixth of the 
600,000 in Massachusetts had access to a free library of any sort, for although 
perhaps no town was then destitute of a moderate collection of good books of the 
kind then most in vogue, either held by some association or lyceum or in the par- 
son's ‘‘study,” yet these were seldom free. Of the 180,000 volumes in the 229 social 
and 50 school-district libraries in the State in 1838, valued at $200,000, it is esti- 
mated that half were in Boston, which then had 62,000 people. Only 25,000 people 
had free access to the 15 town libraries of 3,000 to 4,000 volumes each, and to the 
district-school collections of 10,000 volumes, valued at less than $4,000. There 
were no general circulating libraries out of Boston, and only one-tenth of her 
population had access to those in the city. The immediate success of the district- 
school library in New York and the amount of money expended on it, $55,000 for 
several years in succession, had greatly interested Mr. Mann. He declared the 
passing the law of Massachusetts in 1837 for moderate State aid to this subject 
one of the most important educational measures since the original establishment of 
the common school. It may be that the disappointment from this venture was 
somewhat owing to the limited supply of readable children’s literature, which has 
been largely the growth of the past fifty years. We remember the patient spirit 
in which we plodded through the dreary Sahara of Rollin’s Ancient History and 
the ‘classic ” essays and poems of the Queen Anne writers that filled the shelves 
of our minister’s study, and the delight, as in the coming of a bright spring day, 
when the new doctor came to town and brought the first copy of Shakespeare and 
a hundred good novels and volumes of voyages and travels. 
Mr. Mann’s literary taste was pitched on a key too steep and severe for the com- 
fort of his young friends who came to him for advice. Probably no collection of 
more ‘‘useful” and more unreadable books than the 50 volumes he caused to be 
written or edited for the original public-school libraries of Massachusetts were 
ever offered to the young people of any State. The subsequent movement for 
town and city libraries, often the gift of their old school boys and girls, filled with 
the most attractive works of the day and connected with a reading room for the 
leading journals and periodicals, had well-nigh extinguished the public-school 
library until its recent revival under the administration of Secretary Dickinson 
and State Librarian Tillinghast gave it a new lease of life. But, with all these 
drawbacks, the movement was a good one and out of it has come the present over- 
whelming opportunity for reading. Indeed, it may well be questioned whether 
the boys and girls of fifty years ago, who were compelled to “read, ponder, and
-P-A-G-E-821
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 741 
inwardly digest” the few good books available till they had become a vital part of 
their mental. constitution, were not more profited by their reading than multi- 
tudes of our young folks who revel in a surfeit of the so-called literature supposed 
to be appropriate to the present needs of young America. 
8. The experiment of compulsory attendance at school, if it was ever a reality 
in the early colonial period, had been wrecked against the American Declaration 
of Independence and the proclamation of ‘‘ Liberty throughout the land to all the 
inhabitants thereof.” Certainly, there was no attempt to enforce the practice 
when Horace Mann sat down hard in the official chair of the secretaryship that 
became a throne during his reign of twelve years over the educational mind and 
heart of the old Commonwealth. In 1836 the first attempt was made to deal with 
the scandal of child labor in the factory, which, like a black shadow of despair, 
always accompanies the coming in of manufacturing industry, and even to-day is 
the disgrace of half our own country. In 1850 the truant laws were first put in 
the statute books of Massachusetts. We read with amazement that, as late as 
1842, it was lawful in Massachusetts to keep a child under 12 years of age at work 
in a factory ten hours a day. From this barbarism to the legislation of 1876, only 
one generation, by which no child under 10 years of age could be employed inany 
manufacturing establishment, or under 12 while the public schools are in session, 
or under 14 without having enjoyed twenty weeks of schooling in the year, was 
an upward step into a higher civilization. And nobody in America had labored 
and prayed and stormed and insisted more persistently to this end than Horace 
Mann. 
9. The one hateful side of the old common school, even of the original college 
of the early time, was the severity of discipline. It was not especially a feature of 
the New England Puritan life, for in the South, where family discipline was never 
so rigid, the absolute brutality of corporal punishment in schools is remembered. 
asa hideous dream by multitudes of people yet alive. Our own recollection in 
Massachusetts goes back to the time when no day passed in school without that 
chapter of ‘‘ accidents” which it was assumed would “ happen in the best of fam- 
ilies.” Parents and school authorities seem to have been in league with the school- 
master and schoolmistress to hold the vagrant spirit of the rising generation under 
the terrors of the ferule and rod. There were plenty of teachers who apparently 
exhausted their small mental outfit in devising original and painful methods of 
torture for the idle, dull, and disobedient. To elutch a big book held at arm’s 
length; to ‘“‘ hold down a knot” in the floor by one finger; to stand on one leg; to 
“¢sit with the girls;” to be thrashed, ‘‘jointly and severally,” as it pleased the 
despot in charge; to isolate or mass. the victims—all these horrors come back to us 
asa nightmare only rivaled by the awful ghost novels we read ‘‘on the sly” at 
night. In our own county, a district not backward in education, lived two peda-: 
gogic pugilists whose business during the winter months was to ‘“‘keep out 
schools” that had rebelled against their teacher and often put him out-of-doors 
and “broken up the school.” And this cheerful work produced such an exhibition 
of daily brutality as curdles one’s blood to recall. 
Against this barbarous style of discipline as a system Mr. Mann arrayed himself 
from the first. He abhorred corporal punishment in all its hateful variety, while 
reluctantly confessing that there is a possible limit at which patience and ‘moral 
suasion” may give place to the song of the birch. But he pleaded for the natural 
right of the child to happiness during his school years and the possibility of a 
nobler and more successful method of school government with all his heart. 
His terrible scoring of the thirty-one Boston grammar-school masters for their 
chronic habit of punishment inaugurated a reform by which every teacher who 
inflicted corporal chastisement was compelled to make a record of it, with the 
reasons thereof, always open to public inspection. Of course, a great deal of the
-P-A-G-E-822
    742 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
disorder and disobedience in schools of every sort at that day was the result of 
the bodily discomfort, mental weariness, and moral exasperation caused by the 
old-time schoolhouse, incompetent teachers, and the stupid methods of instruc- 
tion then in vogue. Mr. Mann writes that, until the age of 16, he was never asked 
in school for the meaning of a sentence in a reading lesson; indeed, ‘‘ the inquir- 
ing mind” was notin favor with the average teacher of the day. With the coming 
in of the improved schoolhouse, more attractive text-books and apparatus, better 
teachers and natural methods of instruction, the old savage ideas of ‘‘ school gov- 
ernment and discipline ” have broadened out to the entire field of moral and reli- 
gious or character training, of which government and discipline are but the outward 
garment. Dr. Nott, of New York, and President Wayland, of New England, had 
already inaugurated the great reform in college discipline in the interest of com- 
mon sense, common justice, and common humanity. This movement, at a later 
period, was carried to its splendid culmination by Horace Mann, as president of 
Antioch College, Ohio. There, in a community of 500 boys and girls, gathered in 
from the homes of the new West and Southwest, in a village without police, with 
gardens and fruit orchards on every hand, there was such a spirit of order and 
cheerful respect for the moral proprieties and courtesies as had never been known 
in student life before that day. 
All these topics are discussed in his seven published lectures and twelve reports 
ina manner at once broad and minute, with a patient elaboration of the details of 
common-school keeping, a splendor of illustrative imagination, a fervor of patri- 
otic eloquence, and a solemnity and pathos of moral and religious consecration 
which characterize his method of treating this subject and constitute an era in 
the literature of education, It is this style of dealing with education as related 
to every essential interest of man, individual and social, that gives to these vol- 
umes a permanent value. Whatever elaboration of pedagogic culture or recon- 
dite excursion into the realms of psychology or biology may characterize the 
present or future discussions of our great educators, the time will never come 
when a thorough acquaintance with the writings of Horace Mann will not be the 
most wholesome corrective of extreme views, recalling the experimenter and spec- 
ulator from wrestling with the technicalities of the schoolroom to the vast, wide, 
and profound world outside, from which the child comes to the teacher and to 
which he must so soon return to put in practice what he has there acquired of 
wisdom or manhood. ‘ 
It is said that soon after the beginning of the splendid work of Dr, Barnas Sears 
in the Southern States as agent of the Peabody education fund a large collection 
of Mr. Mann’s addresses, pamphlets, and reports found at Antioch College, Ohio, 
after his death, was distributed through these States with the best results. Of 
the number of educational writers that can be counted on the fingers of one hand 
who have compelled the attention of the large majority of intelligent and patri- 
otic people of this Republic, Horace Mann stands yetsupreme. And this suprem- 
acy he owes to the fact that, above all professional and technical preparation 
for his great work, he was the first educational statesman of the land, and nobody 
so clearly and broadly as he has discerned the vital relation of the common 
school to our American Government and order of society. And no man has set 
forth these relations in a manner at once so instructive to the student in college 
and so uplifting and inspiring to the intelligent citizen of every portion of the 
country. 
At the close of this record of the twelve years’ service of Horace Mann as secre- 
tary of the Massachusetts board of education it will be profitable to sum up the 
visible results of his work in the inauguration of the educational revival in New 
England, which was felt to the remotest border of the last Territory organized by 
Congress. But in 1843, when half his term of office had expired and he was per-
-P-A-G-E-823
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 743 
suaded to take a six months’ vacation with his wife, with hope of recruiting his 
shattered health and for a leisurely observation of European school life, these 
results had already been achicved. Besides the new legislative action already 
referred to, which provided for a thorough system of reporting and a yearly 
abstract of the conduct of affairs being placed before the people of Massachusetts; 
besides a lifting up of the minimum of the school term to six months, which prob- 
ably affected half the smaller towns of the State; the fixing of a more reliable 
compensation for the school committees, and the insisting that these, the only 
supervisors of schools, should perform their duties as laid down in the statute; 
the establishment of three State normal schools; the gathering of teachers into 
county and State associations; the organization of a great system of educational 
lecturing by the most distinguished men of the Commonwealth; the publication 
of the Common School Journal and distribution of many thousands of published 
documents among the teachers and the people; the establishment of district school 
libraries in many of. the towns; the stirring up of the primary teachers of Boston 
to efforts for self-improvement; and beyond all, the soul of all, the mighty 
awakening power of this apostle of the new education, so that no little hamlet in 
the remotest corner of the Commonwealth escaped attention, while more and 
more his reputation was becoming national, there was a gratifying increase in 
the pecuniary support of the schools and improvement in all things connected 
therewith. 
The first abstract sent forth by the board of education in 1837 informed the peo- 
ple of the State that Massachusetts had a population of 691,222 and a property 
valuation for public taxation of $206,668,580 in 1830. There were then 2,918 com- 
mon schools in the State. The number of children and youth between the ages 
of 4 and 16 were 177,053. Of these, 141,837 were under instruction, with an aver- 
age attendance of 111,500. The schools were in session through an average of six 
months and twenty-five days; but this average was secured by the Boston habit 
of keeping school ‘‘the year round” and of the forty or fifty larger towns or cities, 
which maintained a session of seven, eight, or nine months. in fact, one-third of 
the children of school age were not at school and probably one-half of the towns 
in the Commonwealth did not hold their schools in session more than four or five 
months, One-sixth of the children of the State were in 854 private schools, which, 
outside the academies, were generally of a temporary character, with no responsi- 
ple supervision. Indeed, their status was unknown and unknowable outside the 
limited circle of their patrons. There were 5,961 common-school teachers 
employed, of whom 2,370 were men and 3,591 women. The male teachers were 
often college or academical students, teaching during their winter vacations and, 
as a body, were greatly superior to the women, who seldom enjoyed advantages 
for education in any way comparable with their brothers. The men worked at 
an average salary of $25.44 and the women of $11.38 per month, including board, 
generally in the families of the district. The amount annually expended from 
taxation, fees, and subscriptions for the free schools was $513,529.19, less than $3 
per capita for the children and youth of school age. There were 854 private 
schools and academies, many of the former being vacation schools of practically 
the same character as the public schools and taught by the same teachers, though 
with a tuition bill attached, with 27,266 pupils, which cost $328,026.75, more than 
half the school money expended by the State on one-sixth of the children. 
But this was simply the outward showing of a state of affairs which looked 
more discouraging the more completely it was uncovered. The city of Boston, 
with a population of 80,000 and a valuation of $80,000,000, expended on the 7,000 
children in public only one-half of the sum given to the 4,000 in private schools. 
The older cities along the seacoast followed this example, while those of the inte- 
rior, like Worcester and Springfield, reversed the order of expenditure. The boys
-P-A-G-E-824
  744 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
were more numerous in the public schools than the girls; the latter still held 
more under private instruction. Only 14 of the 43 towns directed by law to estab- 
lish .a free high school were complying with the statute. Not one-third of the 
, School committees in the State were living up to the demands of the law in regard 
to the examination of teachers, visiting of schools, or any real supervision of the 
work in the district schoolhouse. Not a teacher in the State was the graduate of 
a normal school, and probably the majority of them had no education beyond 
that gained in the rural country schools, with perhaps a term or two at a neigh- 
boring academy. The condition of great numbers of schoolhouses, according to 
Mr. Mann’s first report, was a scandal on the civilization of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. The habit of the wealthy and educated class of sending their children to 
private and academical schools was fast letting down the common school to the 
rank of a poor man’s refuge and accounted largely for the indifference even of the 
class dependent on them for all the education possible for their own children. 
The lack of any professional training of teachers by lectures, suitable reading, 
and instruction was complete. No wonder the secretary, out of the depths of his 
great heart, wrote: ‘‘Into what a state of feebleness and neglect our common- 
school system has fallen, and how deeply decay has eaten into its vitals! It is 
hoped that when. the people learn into what a dilapidated condition the whole 
frame of this venerable institution has fallen, they will rouse themselves to some 
correspondent exertion to save it from irretrievable ruin.” 
That the people did respond at once in the most effectual way, by putting this 
plea into legislative enactment, is evident. By 1845-46 the secretary could report: 
“In earlier years our reports were principally occupied in exposing wants. A 
much larger portion is now occupied in indicating present improvements.” In 
1848, after six years of his administration, the people were expending $585,000 for 
195,000, and in 1845-46, $620,000 for 203,000 pupils in public schools, with a rela- 
tive ratio of expenditure for private and academical institutions. One by one the 
legislatures came up to their duty of establishing the free high school. Many of 
the most distinguished men of the State were serving on the school committees, 
and generally this important official body lived more nearly up to its duty as the 
only supervising power of the Commonwealth. The secretary declared: ‘In no 
country on earth could the progress of a free system of education be so well studied 
in all its varieties as in the State of Massachusetts.” Its compact location of the 
motive power of government in the township organization enabled each commu- 
nity to move without restraint with a beneficent spirit of rivalry from town to 
town. The reports and abstracts of the secretary were largely read by all intelli- 
gent people. Mr. Mann read every word of the local reports of the 300 towns in 
preparing his own two general reports of 5,500 pages on his return from Europe. 
Meetings were held for the express purpose of listening to the reading of his inter- 
esting public documents. In many of the smaller towns associations of good peo- 
ple were formed to visit the schools and encourage the teachers and people. 
Boston was waking out of its lethargy of self-complacency; the school com- 
mittee came down with a sharp word concerning the condition of schoolhouses 
unworthy so wealthy and beautiful a city as Boston. In 1846 Massachusetts stood at 
the head of the States in the wages paid to teachers, $24.51 per month paid tomenand 
$18.07 paid to women, exclusive of board. The secretary wrote: ‘“ For the last two 
generations, with exceptions comparatively few, all the eminent men of the State, 
whether men of letters, physicians, lawyers, clergymen, legislators, or judges, 
had taught school, more or less, during the early part of their lives.” The waking 
_up to the improvement of the moral and religious teaching of children was 
marked. In 1847 there was not a common school in Massachusetts where the 
Bible was not read, although the State had not yet made Bible reading in the 
schools obligatory by law. The secretary declared that ‘‘far more has been

  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 745 
spoken and printed, heard and read on education within the last twelve years than 
ever before, were it all put together, since the settlement of the colonies.” In 1846 
the Bay State was spending, all told, for the schools $1,000,000, $1,000,000 for its 
churches, and far more for charities, and had already $60,000,000 invested in rail- 
roads at home and beyond its own limits. 
A great improvement was marked in the discipline of the schools by moral and 
humane methods rather than by physical force. The maxim of the secretary, ‘‘No 
low nature can perform the office of a higher in the common school,” was heeded, 
and a greater care was shown in the selection of teachers. The secretary’s state- 
ments read like prophecy: ‘‘ By what spirit are our schools actuated?” ‘‘ Do they 
cultivate the higher faculties of the child?” ‘‘ The children of the people must be 
fitted for society as well as for themselves.” ‘‘Of all neglected or forgotten duties, 
in all ages of the world, the spiritual duties of children are the most neglected.” 
“The old way of clearing the land of refuse population by war, pestilence, and 
famine is outgrown. All willstay with us, and we must educate men or suffer 
by being with them.” In 1845 the secretary declares that the inequality in dis- 
tributing the State funds to the towns has been remedied, and in no year has his 
advice and assistance been so eagerly and widely sought as in the present time. 
In 1848 the people of the State seem to have been thoroughly awakened to the 
improvement of schoolhouses, and had expended for this purpose alone, since 1837, 
$1,000,000, with a steady gain of $100,000 a year for the general management of the 
schools. 
In short, the people of Massachusetts were responding in their own moderate 
and reliable way to the three propositions laid down by their great secretary of 
education, which may well be copied and hung up in every public schoolhouse in 
the United States to-day: 
1. ‘*The successive generations of men, taken collectively, constitute a great 
Commonwealth.” 
2. “The property of the Commonwealth is pledged for the education of all its 
youth up tosuch a point as will save them from poverty and vice and prepare 
them for adequate performance of their social and civil duties.” 
3. ‘The successive holders of this property are trustees bound to the faithful 
execution of this trust by the most sacred obligations; and the embezzlement and 
pillage from children and descendants have not less of criminality and far more 
than the same offenses when perpetrated against contemporaries.” 
On May 1, 1843, Mr. Mann was married to Miss Mary Peabody, sister of Eliza- 
beth Peabody, so well remembered by American kindergartners, and of Mrs. 
Nathaniel Hawthorne, wife of the celebrated novelist, herself a woman of fine 
qualities and unusual literary ability. His health was at one of its periodical 
crises. After six years of prodigious activity and corresponding anxiety it was 
decided by his friends that a release from the workshop could alone save his pre- 
cious life. His proposal, at his own expense, to make a tour of six months in 
Europe, combining the pursuit of health with the observation of educational 
affairs abroad, was accepted. He left the editorship of the Common School 
Journal in the hands of Mr. George B. Emerson and departed on his first and only 
» journey across the great water. 
His physical condition would have been alarming in any man less accustomed 
to ‘‘coming off conqueror” in the fight with the last enemy than himself. He 
could not sleep. As Dr. Howe said: ‘‘ His mind went on of itself.” He was tor- 
mented to distraction by neuralgia and submitted to the removal of ‘‘a whole 
mouthful of teeth” in hope of relief. His wife writes: ‘‘ He fought all his editorial 
battles over on his bed at night.” He carried old Massachusetts and her children 
on his heart wherever he went. In thirteen days from leaving home he was 
visiting the schools, prisons, and charitable institutions of Great Britain.  
-P-A-G-E-826
  746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Nowhere does the absolute preoccupation of his mind in the absorbing work of 
his life appear in a more startling way than during this period. . 
He was received with distinction in Great Britain, and saw more that was 
characteristic of the Empire than was common for a visitor outside of official life. 
But the Puritan in his nerves and blood rose up in obstinate protest against the 
terrible contrasts of life in the Old World. At Eaton Hall, near Chester, the 
grand seat of the Duke of Westminster, the first of the great English estates he 
visited, he was shocked at the sight of infirm old women doing the hard outdoor 
work of strong men. He writes: ‘‘I left the magnificent spectacle in a state of 
mind I can not now express.” Thomas Carlyle seems to have been in one of his 
least bearish moods, for his visitor went away with real enjoyment of ‘the genu- 
ine, irresistible, boyish heartiness of his laugh.” He noticed that the dog kennels 
on the estate of the Duke of Buccleugh ‘‘ were much better built and had a far 
more comfortable air about them than half the cottages we have seen in England 
and Scotland.” ‘‘ The object that called up the deepest and tenderest associations 
seen since I left home was the lowly, humble cottage in which Jeannie Deans is 
said to have been born.” He could not understand the admiration of the Scotch 
for their native heather. To him it was ‘‘brown and lifeless, and had not a 
particle of beauty to ally it to poetry. * * * It looks asif it were dead when 
itcame up.” At York Cathedral he writes: ‘‘To me the sight of. one child edu- 
cated to understand something of his Maker and of that Maker’s works is a far 
more glorious spectacle than all the cathedrals which the art of man has ever 
reared.” Yet he was profoundly impressed by the cathedral at Cologne, and 
visited it again and again while in that city. 
Ata great fancy ball at Almacks he blurts out: ‘‘Such dresses! Such carica- 
tures of humanity were enough to make a man call the baboons and kangaroos 
his brethren rather than these.” But he remarks that ‘‘ about twenty ladies were 
beautifully and tastefully dressed. The money of the others apparently did not 
hold out, for their dresses rose but just above the waist. Among the men there 
was not asingle good head.” At the Tower of London he exclaims: ‘‘ Three millions 
of jewels in the regalia, and more than three millions of destitute, almost starving, 
subjects!” At Stafford House, the London residence of the Duke of Sutherland, 
he writes: “All this is splendid beyond anything I ever saw. Were there nocrime 
and no poverty in the world how one could enjoy this.” If it were not for the 
necessity of caring for his health he ‘‘ would far prefer to be closeted in narrow 
apartments, working for the children at home, to all the joy of beholding this 
magnificent display of Scottish lakes.” 
In this preoccupation of spirit he journeyed through Great Britain and portions 
of the Continent for six months. He was by no means insensible to the attrac- 
tions of noble scenery, rare cultivation of the land, splendid architecture, music 
and art, and the amenities of cultivated society. But, when he turned his back, 
in 1837, on the brilliant career of his early manhood to consecrate himself to the 
children of the Commonwealth, like the great apostle he said in his heart, ‘‘ This 
one thing Ido.” Henceforth his wearisome days and sleepless nights, for twenty 
years, were to be given to the mighty ministry of education, which, in his vocabu- 
lary, represented nothing less than the entire training of young America for 
American citizenship. 
But small rest was found for his body during these six months, crowded with 
experience that ripened into the future administration of his great affairs. It is 
doubtful if the European visit of any American in later years has borne a more 
abundant and precious fruitage to the Republic than this summer rush of Horace 
Mann from city to city through Great Britain, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and 
France, in pursuit of all that could be gathered for ‘‘ his 80,000 children at home.” 
He found popular education in England less advanced than in any country vis- 
ited. Despite a general educational charity fund of several millions of dollars, 
 
-P-A-G-E-827
AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. TAT 
1,500,000 English children were living in complete mental destitution. A bill was 
then before Parliament for the establishment of a national system of education, to be 
virtually under the control of the clergy of the Church of England; even the cer- 
tificate of a clergyman being necessary to secure employmentin afactory by achild. 
The most flagrant favoritism was shown in the distribution of this charity fund; 
for the searching investigations that came several years later into the condition 
of the secondary education in England had not yet uncovered the scandal of so 
many of these endowed schools. At Oxford he heard elaborate courses of lec- 
tures given by learned professors to empty benches; the chief study under tutor- 
ship being Latin and Greek. He wasinformed that nine-tenths of the children in 
England received all their schooling before the age of 9. There was no effective 
system of national instruction till a generation after this. 
In Scotland he found a different condition of affairs, The parochial-school 
system had there been in operation almost two centuries, but only one-third of the 
children in Scotland were found in this class of schools, the remainder being 
attended to by private arrangements. He was astonished, but not edified, at the 
prodigious activity and energy of the Scottish school life. The teachers and pupils 
performed double the amount of work that seemed possible in the schools at home, 
The masters were generally college graduates and aimed at a thoroughness of 
instruction, especially in language, nowhere else attained. The national system 
of common schools in Ireland was then in the early years of its success. Three 
hundred thousand children were being taught in schools in which the rival church 
authorities agreed to unite on unsectarian moral and practical religious instruction 
during school hours, with arrangements for theological training outside, the use 
of schoolhouses for religious and political gatherings being forbidden, He was 
greatly interested in Archbishop Whately, the most prominent author of this 
arrangement, and regarded him as one of the ablest and most catholic men of the 
Kingdom. The Irish system of prisons was seen and studied with intense interest. 
Several of the great private school corporations and benevolent institutions for 
children attached to others met his approval. But, outside a few architectural 
displays in private school buildings, he did not see a common schoolhouse in his 
entire visit that compared with a second-rate house at home. The children uni- 
formly sat with their feet dangling above the floor, on benches without backs or 
desks, and in Great Britain, outside a few exceptional places, with small provision 
for the illustration of studies. The normal schools were private enterprises, and 
largely restrained by the sectarian policy of their management. 
In Germany he found another condition of affairs, as far as the administration, 
methods of instruction, and spirit of the school life were concerned. He visited 
Prussia, Saxony, Holland, Belgium, and several of the minor German States, tak- 
ing Paris on his return. Here, for the first time, he saw the result of a wise and 
powerful public policy in the organization of a system of education that included 
every family and went on with the irresistible force and precision of one of the 
powers of nature. In Prussia the minister of education was a member of the 
royal council, with a position, emoluments, and honors similar to other high 
officials of State. A complete system of normal schools supplied the country with 
educated men teachers. A thorough inspection of the schools was all the time 
going on by competent supervisors. So complete was the effectof the compulsory 
system that the children seemed born to go to school. In Saxony he found the 
most to admire, the little kingdom having a constitution and Parliament, “a good 
bit of ham sandwiched between Prussia and Austria.” All the German States 
were only in the beginning of constitutional government. Austria had not yet 
succeeded in providing for the education of the whole people, but Holland was 
even more advanced than the German States. Belgium had established a system 
of schools in 1830, and France was moving in the same direction. 
In these Continental States alone he found what he went for. Horace Mann
-P-A-G-E-828
  748 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
was preeminently an educational statesman of the progressive American type. 
He did not go to Germany, like so many scholars since his day, to admire the 
administration of imperial government or fancy that the motive power of public 
education in the United States could be safely transferred from the whole people 
to an aristocracy of learned men. He had no great faith in a compulsory educa- 
tion of the German type, with a bayonet p.odding the waistband of every indif- 
ferent or obstinate subject. In his famous seventh report, made after the return 
from his European visit, after an elaborate explanation of the many superiorities 
of the German school system, showing the most thorough appreciation of its 
numerous excellencies, he closes with a most powerful and philosophical analysis 
of the essential difference between American and Continental European society. 
He explains the fact that a system of schools in many ways so excellent, had not 
yet materially changed the despotic character of society in Prussia. The reasons 
he found in the fact that, in 1848, the peasantry of Prussia had not yet been half 
a century out of the bondage of a practical serfdom; in the contamination of 
society from the evil examples of the superior classes; in the fact that the mass of 
the children were withdrawn from school at so early an age, only the superior 
youth being encouraged to go on even to the secondary education; and specially 
that, after school, there was nothing to stimulate that ambition for rising in life 
which is so powerful in every class of American youth. The popular saying in 
Germany, ‘‘ The school is good; the world is bad,” had condensed all these condi- 
tions into one sentence. 
He failed not to comprehend the method and spirit that dominated the educa- 
tionai system. The masses of the people should be made sufficiently intelligent, 
moral and religious, content with their lot, patriotic, and with a childlike rever- 
ence and affection for their rulers. The school life was to him by far the most 
hopeful spectacle in all these countries. The teachers seemed to him, by all odds, 
thefinest body of men he met—the true fathers of the young, rather than pedagogues 
of the old-time sort. Many of the improved methods of instruction now in com- 
mon use in all good American schools were there seen in full operation. He 
admired the success in introducing the little children to proper school life, the skill- 
ful way of teaching reading, numbers, geography, nature-knowledge, especially 
the writing, drawing, and music. The discipline was after his own heart. In 
Holland corporal punishment had been abolished, and during his entire visitations 
on the Continent he never saw a pupil undergoing punishment. A beautiful 
spirit of affectionate confidence, like the sunshine, pervaded the schoolroom. He 
never saw a teacher sitting or using a text-book. A great variety of methods of 
illustration, especially for primary pupils, were noted. The schoolhouses were 
observed. They were greatly inferior to the better sort at home. The conveni- 
ence of the children was hardly thought of, ventilation almost unknown. “The 
Dutch and Germans have no noses.” ‘‘Everyone sleeps, even in summer, under 
feather beds, and only the convicts in the prisons have blankets!” 
For six months, twelve hours a day, did this indefatigable educator ‘‘in pur- 
suit of health” traverse this wide area of country. He found his Scotch friend, 
George Combe, in Germany, also an invalid, and the two wooed health by endless 
talks into the nights, which were often spent in reading public documents concern- 
ing the. institutions visited by day. In Germany Mr. Mann was known to the 
children as ‘‘the white-haired gentleman.” He went into every open schoolhouse 
door and absorbed information as through the pores of the skin. He was not the 
first of American explorers in that field. Already had President Bache, of Gir- 
ard College, Philadelphia, made a valuable report concerning the public, chari- 
table, and penal institutions of the Continent. In 1830 Rey. Calvin Stowe had 
visited Europe, at the instance of the State of Ohio, and given an interesting and 
widely read account of all he saw. But Mr. Mann went with such an outfit of 
enthusiasm, experience, and faculty of trained observation as no previous visitor.
-P-A-G-E-829
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 749 
His lofty manhood rose: story by story above the head of the average school man. 
He saw and appreciated all that was to be seen of improved administration and 
method. He was in perfect sympathy with the loving spirit that so distinguished 
the schools of Germany especially from those of Great Britain. His large expe- 
rience and intense interest in the criminal code and the working of the charitable 
institutions for the deaf, dumb, and blind and youthful offenders, and the great 
moral movement which under the name ‘‘the temperance reformation” has so 
blessed American society, enabled him to measure the value of that side of Euro- 
pean life. He found nothing in the care of the insane to surpass the asylum 
established during his early political life in Worcester, Mass. He gave close atten- 
tion to the improved method of teaching the deaf, dumb, and blind as introduced 
in the asylums at Boston and Hartford. The prison discipline of the Continent 
still lingered in the barbarism of the dark ages. And above all, he overlooked the 
entire life of the countries he visited from the high vantage ground of educational 
” statesmanship. 
For these reasons this tour of six months, embarrassed as it was by actual fee- 
pleness of body and by the disability that he could only read and not easily speak 
the Continental languages, was one of the most important ever made since the 
years when Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson went abroad as the first representa- 
tives of the new American Republic. His seventh report to the board of educa- 
tion, made in 1844, was in many respects the most revolutionary and influential 
document ever launched on the tide of American public education. It was every- 
where read, and everywhere awakened admiration and aspiration for a higher 
training of the teacher, better methods of instruction, and a more benevolent type 
of school discipline. It also woke up the last grand revolt against his administra- 
tion. In 1845 Horace Mann, by universal assent, stood at the head of American 
education. Henceforth his life, as secretary of the Massachusetts board of educa- 
tion, Representative in ‘Congress, a great schoolmaster let loose in the National 
Capitol, and president of Antioch College, Ohio, was a prolonged conflict with 
the ‘‘remainder of wrath” inherited from two centuries of crude educational 
experimenting still fondly cherished by a large body of men in all departments of 
American educational life. 
From this important journey Mr. Mann returned to wrestle with new labors 
and confront an opposition which through his entire administration had been 
seeking occasion for an assault in force. On the publication of the famous seventh 
report, the most important document in behalf of the new education yet presented 
to the American people, it was evident that the protest against the new educa- 
tional heresies must be made or their opponents ‘‘forever afterwards hold their 
peace.” It came in the most impressive and respectable way, in the celebrated 
pamphlet issued by the thirty-one grammar-school masters of Boston. This docu- 
ment, written in a moderate spirit, was not so much a pronounced attack on the 
advanced views of the secretary, as illustrated by his observations in the schools 
of Germany and in Holland, as an elaborate denial by those gentlemen of what 
they declared his exaggerated statements concerning the condition of popular 
education in Massachusetts. Without positively assailing the reform movement, 
of which the board of education, through its secretary, was the representative, 
they made the curious mistake of regarding a great deal in his statement of facts 
concerning education abroad as a covert disparagement and impeachment of 
themselves. 
This document brought from Mr. Mann a powerful reply, in which the truth of 
his representations concerning the general conditions of the common school in 
Massachusetts at the time of his election to his office was established by an over- 
whelming display of statistics. Noman ever better understood the art of massing 
figures upon an important point than he. His fiery rhetoric and brilliant illus- 
trative imagination lighted up the long vistas of his facts as by an illumination of
-P-A-G-E-830
  750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
electrical lamps. The effect was similar to the spectacle of the first use of the 
electric search light which I witnessed on a Mississippi steamer, when every 
plantation, village, and hamlet was caught in its night undress and flashed out 
upon the spectator in its dishabille. It was not necessary that the secretary should 
assail the Boston schools or depreciate the work of their masters. It was only 
important that the whole field of the reformed common-school life of the day 
should be illuminated by a skillful arrangement of facts and an exact statement 
of the results of the new order where applied, leaving the people to their own 
decision. 
It is not necessary to revive the memory of that last important demonstration 
against the revival of the common school of Massachusetts, or to attempt to fix 
the responsibility for the evils and defects that were exposed by the relentless crit- 
icism of the great secretary and others that came to his aid.. The masters only did 
what any body of educated men can always be expected to do, practically intrusted 
with despotic power in educational affairs. While nominally chosen by annual 
election of the school committee, they really had a life lease of these important 
positions. Indeed, this body of schoolmasters was the only abiding power in the 
Boston schools. Through their great influence, the neglect of proper supervision, 
and the preoccupation of the leading classes in their own affairs they really elected 
the school committee, appointed the teachers, and generally directed the whole 
organized scheme of discipline and instruction. There was yet no city superin- 
tendent of schools in Boston, The grammar-school department was divided into 
reading and writing schools, meeting at different hours of the day and presided 
over by separate instructors. While the teachers of the elementary grades had 
shown a commendable interest in the work of the secretary and were moving in 
the right direction, this higher realm of the grammar schools, where the great 
majority of the children received their last schooling, was practically a close edu- 
cational corporation. There were a few progressive and a small group of faithful 
and hard-working men among this number, and the policy of the attack on the 
secretary was not adopted until after much discussion and against the protest of 
the ablest men of the body. After the first round of controversy one of the lead- 
ing masters retired from the field. The ablest of all, though among the foremost 
in his contention agaiast the German methods of instruction, subsequently came 
round to an enthusiastic indersement of the new education, became a progressive 
professor of didactics in Brown University, and, through a vigorous old age, was 
known as one of the most attractive lecturers and pauls on all subjects relat- 
ing to the common school. 
This controversy was protracted over more than eo years, through a small 
library of pamphlets, and stirred up a brisk discussion of educational affairs 
through the press of the entire country. The result was a signal triumph for the 
reformed education in Boston and a complete indorsement of the policy of the 
State board of education. Four of the assailants among the masters lost their 
positions on demonstration of inefficiency. Several of the leading citizens of Bos- 
ton, like Dr. J. G. Palfrey and Hon. George S. Hilliard, were placed on the city 
school committee. A committee of examination of the schools was appointed, 
with Dr. S. G. Howe, Judge Parsons, and Hon. Charles G. Loring as members. 
This, the first thorough investigation of the city schools, revealed such a spectacle 
of mechanical instruction, abuse of corporal punishment, and neglect of physical 
comfort and health in schoolhouses that the secretary could well afford to retire 
and leave the contest with the people. <A city ordinance was passed compelling 
the registration of all cases of corporal punishment ina book open to public inspec- 
tion. A grand shaking up of the dry bones of routine, a partial curtailment of 
the usurped power of the masters, and the beginning of a reorganization of the 
entire school system prepared the way for the establishment of a city superin- 
tendency of education a few years later.
-P-A-G-E-831
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 751 
A simultaneous assault on the secretary by a portion of the denominational 
religious press brought out from Mr. Mann, more plainly than ever, his strong 
convictions on the importance of moral and practical religious instruction and 
training in the schools. Under his earnest presentation of these ideas the entire 
body of common schools of the State were using the Bible, not for a sectarian 
purpose, but as the handbook of private and public morals. The secretary’s ninth 
report to the board of education, in 1845, is one of the most cogent, thorough, and 
illuminating addresses on moral discipline and character training in public 
schools ever written, and should be kept in publication as a treatise of permanent 
value for teachers. He writes: “By what spirit are our schools characterized? 
Do they cultivate the higher faculties in the nature of the children?” ‘The chil- 
dren of the Republic must be fitted for society, as well as for themselves.” ‘Of 
all neglected or forgotten duties in all ages of the world, the spiritual culture of 
children has been most neglected.” ‘No low nature can perform the office of a 
high one in the schoolroom.” ‘‘Try to vitalize the conscience of a child, instead 
of tying him up to a set of rules.” ‘‘The true teacher will consider the train of 
feeling not less than the train of thought which is excited by the exercises of the 
schoolroom.” No idea was more abhorrent to Horace Mann than the extreme 
“secular” theory of the common school, advocated by an influential body of edu- 
cators and to some extent actually enforced during the past thirty years. His 
counsel had a great effect on fixing the present use of the Bible in the common 
schools of Massachusetts by compulsory law, with ample safeguards for the rights 
of conscience. 
One of the points of attack by the thirty-one Boston schoolmasters was that Mr.. 
Mann was nota professional teacher, but a theorist let loose upon a professional 
class which represented the wisdom of experience. The charge was disposed of 
by the fact that he had, from his youth, been a teacher in the common district 
schools, a tutor in Brown University, for many years an active member of a 
board of education, and always more deeply interested in educational studies 
than in any other line of investigation. As an all-around educator, Mr. Mann’s 
primary qualifications for his great position were: 
1. A genius for morality and practical religion in their application to common 
affairs and a profound knowledge of the life of New England, including civil life, 
as if, from his cradle, its every feature had been impressed on his memory bya 
spiritual photograph. 
2. A culture much more extended than that of the ablest schoolmaster; as an 
eminent and successful member of the legal profession; distinguished in public 
life as a member and presiding officer in the legislature, including a wide acquaint- 
ance with all classes of the people and a powerful influence over the foremost men 
of the Commonwealth. 
8. His long and careful study of the problems of penal, charitable, and reforma- 
tory institutions, especially for youthful offenders, had greatly enlarged his compre- 
hension of the complex problems of popular education. And, over and above all, 
his twenty years and more of educational life were characterized by a consecra- 
tion to the children’s cause that, like a great flaming light-house in the center of 
his being, made his opinions, conduct, and entire manhood as transparent as the 
day. 
In his eighth report, 1845, the secretary enlarges on topics hitherto discussed, 
although he writes: ‘‘ Up to the present time these reports have been largely occu- 
pied in pointing out defects; at present in noting the march of improvement.” He 
warmly praises the great work going on in New York, and declared that State 
was doing more than any in the world for common schools. He fails to notice 
that the leading educational spirits in that State had been men and women from 
New England. The original common-school legislation in New York was pushed 
through by a group of Connecticut born and bred members of the legislature,
-P-A-G-E-832
  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the first State superintendent of schools, in 1820, being Gideon Hawley, of that 
State. Dr. Eliphalet Nott and Mrs. Emma Willard were the pioneers of the great 
reforms in the higher education of young men and women. The later movement 
that culminated in the results so highly estimated by Mr. Mann originated in west- 
ern New York, where the New England element was an overpowering influence. 
Wadsworth, May, Hosmer, Dwight, and Page, and others too numerous to men- 
tion, were the leaders in the great revival contemporaneous with Mann. It is true 
that, in the outward arrangements of the common school the Empire State dis- 
played that characteristic energy and skill of executive capacity in public affairs 
in which it was always foremost in the Republic. Its system of common-school 
supervision, local, county, and State, was well planned. Its legislatures were 
move generous than those of other States, and its teachers somewhat better paid. 
But there, as always in this and other directions, the prodigious power of local 
administration in which New England has always excelled, with less display of 
educational machinery, has secured better results in the actual schooling of the 
children. 
The tenth report of the secretary was chiefly concerned with the educational 
history of the Commonwealth. It was a carefully prepared and admirably written 
document. It showed the gradual steps by which the State had advanced from 
the original law of 1647 in which the radical idea of universal education was 
shadowed forth until the establishment of the State board of education, almost 
two hundred years later. Like all the secretary’s reports, each a laborious and 
exhaustive treatise on some aspect of public education, this should be taken out 
of its hiding place in the volume of his collected works, reprinted in a cheap 
pamphlet form and widely circulated. There is no writing on education to-day 
superior to volumes that were produced through these notable years of the great 
revival. Certainly in the power and elaboration with which the general idea of 
the American common school was presented, the breadth of view in the discussion 
of school government and administration, even in the treatment of improved 
methods of instruction, we shall find little to equal and less to surpass the works 
of Horace Mann. His pen seemed to move by a power without himself. For nine 
years he edited the Common School Journal and wrote a large portion of its con- 
tents. His correspondence was immense. His home became a sort of “ intelli- 
gence office” in educational affairs, thirty letters a day being his common diet.’ 
He had achieved the foremost place in the admiration and reverence of the Ameri- 
can educational public, as the chief administrative representative of the reformed 
common school, and was known abroad as no other educational leader in our 
country has been even until the present day. 
In 1847, in his eleventh report, he returns to his favorite theme of the relation 
of the common school to public prosperity, and discusses this topic with his usual 
thoroughness, enthusiasm, and power of concentration. He says: ‘‘ Far more has 
been spoken and printed, heard and read on this theme within the last twelve 
years than ever before, were it all put together, since the settlement of the colo- 
nies.” ‘Spain has handled more gold and silver than all the other nations, but is 
now the poorest nation in Christendom.” ‘Ignorance is fatal to prosperity.” 
“Reading and writing are not education; the habit of publishing statistics of 
education predicated on reading and writing reveals the false idea of education.” 
In 1847 there was not a common school in Massachusetts where the Bible was not 
read, although not required by law. 
The time was now approaching when the great secretary could afford ‘‘to take 
account of stock” and estimate the outward results of his ten years of such labor 
as few men have given to the cause of education in any country. In his last 
report, 1848, he goes over again the wonderful record of popular education in the 
material development of the people. During the eleven years of his administra- 
tion $1,000,000 had been expended in the building and repairing of schoolhouses,
-P-A-G-E-833
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 753 
more than the entire school property of the State was worth in 1837. A corre- 
sponding improvement in all the sanitary arrangements had been witnessed. 
Three State normal schools had been established—at Lexington, afterwards West 
Newton; Barre, afterwards Westfield; and Bridgewater—all under superior teach- 
ers and all sending forth a class of graduates who every year have done remark- 
able work, not only in Massachusetts, but all over the Union. The establishment 
of the teachers’ institutes and gathering of teachers’ associations inaugurated one 
of the most effective agencies for the uplift of the profession. 
The Common School Journal was without question the ablest and most influen- 
tial organ of the great revival, and its volumes to-day are a model of what a jour- 
nal of education should be. He had waked up a powerful interest in popular 
education among the leading men of the State, all of whom, almost without excep- 
tion, were ready by voice and pen to forward the enterprise. The school laws of 
the State had been revised, especially in the interest of a more effective adminis- 
tration by the school committees of the rural schools. The proper graded system 
was being established in all the large villages and cities. A great reform in 
school government and discipline had been inaugurated, especially in discarding 
the use of prizes and destructive emulation and the decline of corporal punish- 
ment. A decided advance had been made in primary education in the direction 
indicated by Mr. Mann in his report on the German schools. The old wasteful 
habit of a multiplicity of schoolbooks had given way to a uniform series of 
improved text-books. The movement for the establishment of school libraries 
had borne good fruit, perhaps the most reliable result being that out of this was 
developed the free town library, now almost universal through the State. The 
local appropriations for education had steadily increased with the larger attend- 
ance on school and greater length of school terms. Half the school population of 
Boston was already gathered from the new foreign immigration, and the problem 
of the church parochial against the common school was coming to the front. 
But these general items of progress were but an index to the greatest work done 
in these notable twelve years. In that time the people’s common school had been 
lifted from a questionable to an assured position of permanent superiority in the 
estimation of all classes of men. The administration of public education had be- 
come a subject of general public interest. Nowhere was there a trace of the apol- 
ogetic tone in the spoken or written plea of the secretary, a mighty sermon eleven 
years long to all peoples in all portions of the domain, With a relentless severity 
sometimes bordering on exaggeration he exposes every defect of the present con- 
dition, But never does he waver in the assertion that all this is but the abuse of 
the system, due to popular indifference, professional incompetency, ecclesiastical 
bigotry, and the same causes that always and everywhere hinder the progress of 
God’s kingdom on earth. We read somewhere of the palace of a great lord in 
England where during every hour of the day could be heard in every corner of 
the vast pile the music of an organ in the chapel. So through all these years of 
the official life of Horace Mann was the Commonwealth filled with the sound of 
his inspiring summons to the people to wake out of sleep and put forth the entire 
energy of the Commonwealth in behalf of the children. Full well did his pro- 
phetic soul contemplate the swift on-coming of the awful years of trial for the 
Republic. At the end of half a term in Congress he wrote: ‘‘ You do not know 
how homesick and Statesick I am—that is, how I long to get back among the boys 
and girls of the Massachusetts schools.” He writes Sam. J. May: ‘‘ The schools 
will be found to be the way that God has chosen for the regeneration of the 
world. God is never in a hurry, but we are.” 
Mr. Mann had now served the State of Massachusetts eleven years as secretary 
of the board of education with a fidelity and consecration of ability rare in official 
life. His wife writes: ‘‘ During all his educational life he had never allowed him-

self one day of pure recreation. If he made a visit to a friend, some educational 
errand was sure to lay in ambush or some plea to be entered for the furtherance 
of his cherished plans. He had not the art of lying fallow and thus gathering 
new strength for labor.” She continues with a charming description of his life 
with the three children given to him in the providential marriage by which he 
obtained a home and doubtless added a dozen years to his already exhausted life. 
Always somewhat lacking in personal tact and the politician’s art of ‘‘mixing;’ 
even severe, stern, and almost ascetic in his social tastes; during the later years of 
his life a total abstainer from strong drink, tea, and coffee and a fierce hater of 
tobacco in any form; opposed to the recreation of dancing in the State normal 
schools; even uncertain about the reading of fairy tales and history by children, 
and never thoroughly appreciative of romance and poetry, he was always a dear 
lover of little children. As president of Antioch College he was probably the 
most approachable and thoroughly interested in every student of any great uni- 
versity magnate since Dr. Nott. 
At the period now under consideration he was once more prostrated by the reck- 
less habit of overwork in which he had indulged for the past eleven years. It is 
almost amusing, were it not so pathetic, to read his sage, positive ideas of the obli- 
gation of ail men to adhere to the divine laws of physiology, as in his comment on 
the death of Dr. William E. Channing, while no public man in America more 
evidently brought himself to his grave at the very crisis of perhaps his greatest 
triumph than Horace Mann. But his example is only another illustration of the 
“higher law” of consecration to a great cause at all hazards, in obedience to which 
every movement for a larger life in society is advanced by the personal sacrifice 
of its leaders. Horace Mann was built physically for an athlete and centenarian. 
But he began life with fitting for college in six months, kept himself always a 
suffering invalid and a “‘light weight,” though more than 6 feet high, and died at 
62, because there was no more to be given, 
But now came across his educational career an episode of return to the political 
life abandoned in 1887 to assume the office of secretary of the Massachusetts board 
of education. John Quincy Adams died, and from every side came up the demand 
that Horace Mann should consent to be elected as his successor in the House of 
Representatives in the Congress of the United States. 
There was much to induce him to resume his political career. His preliminary 
work had been done as the leader of the great revival in common-school educa- 
tion, The reforms he had inaugurated were now well under way in the legislative 
body which alone had the power to carry on the work by the gradual method only 
possible to such progress. The terrible toil of a post in which he was both superior 
and subordinate in official work, the target of an opposition that as it passed over 
to a numerical minority lost nothing of its intensity and personal malignity; his 
growing interest in the antislavery cause, which after a generation of popular 
agitation had invaded the Government of the United States, never to let go its 
‘hold till the close of the civil war, fifteen years later; possibly an overestimate by 
himself and his friends of the probable infiuence of the chief educator of the 
nation tranferred to Congress; conspired to urge him to this change of life. His 
only chance for living seemed to be a change of work, although it might be to an 
even more absorbing and exhausting occupation. 
He was elected, and. early in the year 1848 took his seat in Congress. But the 
Massachusetts State board of education insisted on his retaining his office of secre- 
tary for a year tocome. He soon found that ‘‘ he had assumed new duties with- 
out being released from old ones,” He writes from Washington that ‘‘he finds 
himself a sort of educational intelligence office at the national Capitol, at least 
thirty letters a day on topics of this sort alone to be considered and answered.” 
He yielded to the importunity of Dr. 8. G. Howe and Charles Sumner to take up 
the case of Captains Drayton and Sayers, on trial before a court in the District of
-P-A-G-E-835
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 755 
Columbia for abduction of negro slaves on vessels under their command. This 
alone absorbed a good part of his time during the first year of his residence at 
Washington. The demand on him as a lecturer on education, temperance, and 
the whole range of topics lying adjacent to his central idea could not be resisted. 
The result was that during the four years of his Congressional career he was one 
of the most laborious public men in the country. 
But it can not be said that from the point of view of political statesmanship 
these four years in Congress were the most distinguished or useful portions of his 
public career. Endowed with some of the highest qualities of a great political 
agitator, possibly a successful statesman in a revolutionary period, he had been 
too long engrossed in his life work of educational reform to change his sphere of 
labor with impunity. As an educational statesman at a time requiring a singular 
union of courage, aggressive policy, and a moral enthusiasm verging on prophecy, 
no man in America has been so eminently successful. His criticisms and deci- 
sions indeed often brought him into sharp antagonism with his own reliable sup- 
porters and quite alienated the more ‘‘radical” fraternity, who discard ‘“ policy” 
in the attempt to enforce abstract truth at all hazards, though the heavens fall, 
wrecking the cause itself in the catastrophe. But he returned to political life at 
a time most inauspicious for the political reputation or even usefulness of the 
kind of man he was. 
The tremendous controversy of the ‘‘compromise measures” of 1850-1852 was 
already on. The most celebrated statesmen of the period were shaken from their 
feet or swept out to sea by the incoming tide of civil war. Horace Mann could 
testify as eloquently as the most impassioned reformer against slavery, which he 
regarded as the one menace of the Union. But while this attitude made him the 
unflinching opponent of the opposition, he was compelled, by his constitutional 
conservatism in administration, to adhere to the party that sent him to Congress. 
By his support of the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, of Massachusetts, for Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, and similar votes, he woke up an even more relent- 
less hostility among people who through culture and position had been his cowork- 
ers in the educational revival at home. His opinion of the nonconforming sort in 
public affairs is well expressed in his words: ‘How strange is that hate of an 
evil thing which adopts the very means to secure its triumph! How strange that 
love of a good thing that destroys it.” 
But it is doubtful if Mr. Mann ever fully realized the essential difference 
between the position of an educator and a politician. The statesmanship of the 
one is not the statesmanship of the other. The fundamental office of the educator 
is to so develop the manhood and womanhood of children and youth through the 
discipline of the heart, the head, and the hand that the graduate from school 
shall of himself be capable of dealing with all questions of practical importance 
in private and public life. The central idea of republican government is that a 
perfectly educated people can be trusted to know their rights and meet public 
emergencies as they occur. The office of the statesman in politics is, with an 
unfaltering devotion to the eternal principles of freedom, justice, and humanity, 
to adjust his policy to the present aspect of public affairs and neglect no oppor- 
tunity of gaining a point in behalf of the people, whatever else may be neglected. 
Herein is the notable superiority of the Anglo-Saxon peoples, which, during the 
involved and obscure battle for liberty which, 
“ Pequeathed from bleeding sire to son, 
Though often lost is ever won,” 
has been the author of all the progressive constitutional government now existing 
in the world. 
American history has not yet come to a final estimate of the great patriotic 
statesmen of the era preceding our civil war. Certainly Mr. Mann had not the
-P-A-G-E-836
  756 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
outfit for impartial and successful political statesmanship at that critical period. 
In his seat in the House of Representatives at Washington, as in the office of the 
secretary of the board of education in Boston, he was still the great schoolmaster 
and educational statesman. Indeed, he was probably induced to go to Washing- 
ton by the hope of establishing the national department of education which came 
twenty years later, and over which his friend and coworker Henry Barnard was the 
first Commissioner. In his controversies with the opponents of educational 
reform in Massachusetts he had acquired a “ short method” of dealing with a dis- 
putant, prodigiously effective under the circumstances, but quite out of place in 
a body like the national House of Representatives. Mr. Blaine, in his remarkable 
eulogy on President James A. Garfield, has set forth in striking words the mental 
constitution of this hody and the prodigious difficulty of acquiring or exerting 
influence over it. Mr. Mann always appeared to the majority of its members as 
an eloquent and patronizing pedagogue, lecturing the Representatives of thirty- 
two ‘‘sovereign States” as an excitable and high-toned college president might 
harangue a crowd of uproarious students on the edge of a rebellion. Only once 
he seems to have obtained an almost universal attention by a remarkable speech 
on education. This address brought around him a crowd of admiring hsteners 
and woke up a new interest in general education in many of the leading Southern 
Members of Congress. At the close of his first term of service he was reelected, 
although his attack on Daniel Webster, then at the summit of his personal popu- 
larity among the conservative classes of New England, had so estranged thousands 
of the most influential people of these States that he could henceforth hardly 
expect to live in peace at home. His call to the presidency of Antioch College, 
Ohio, in 1854 was a blessed reprieve from a position which would have been an 
endless conflict during the remainder of his active life. 
But whatever may have been the influence of his great activity in the cause of 
liberty and union in Washington and through the country, he never doubted that 
his real place was at the helm of the revival in universal education. One of his 
most notable deliverances was a letter to Rev. D. Wright, jr., on the controversy 
concerning moral and religious instruction in common schools, especially as applied 
to the contention of the bishops of the Catholic Church. He says, ‘‘ Moral quali- 
fications, and ability to inculcate and enforce the Christian virtues, I consider to 
be even of greater moment than literary attainments in the teachers.” He believes 
that such qualifications can be found among the disciples of all creeds and ecclesi- 
astical organizations, and would only require in the teachers a wise and strict 
avoidance of the sectarian spirit and method. He writes: ‘“‘I have always and 
under all circumstances held that the Bible is a book that should be introduced 
into our schools.” His own fidelity to conscience is always to be noted. ‘‘I shall 
try to keep my conscience, though in so doing I may lose my office.” He sees 
clearly that to go into politics from education is ‘going from the frying pan into 
the fire,” and writes to Charles Sumner, not yet in the Senate, who is urging him 
on to some new effort: ‘‘I think you are rather the hardest taskmaster since 
Pharaoh, and Iam not sure I ought to stop with that old Egyptian scamp.” 
To Father Pierce he writes: ‘‘I have not the slightest expectation of ever feel- 
ing any attachment for my present position. I have no idea that I can make any 
effective impression on the body with which I am associated. From present 
appearances I have not run away from correspondence on schools and education, 
but intoit. I may have an opportunity to do an unseen work in this behalf— 
even greater than I have ever done before. I have seen enough already to give 
me even a deeper conviction of the necessity and indispensableness of education 
than I ever had before. It is the only way whereby a Republic can be saved.” 
Herein we can not doubt was this four years of political life a valuable educa- 
tion for Mr. Mann. It removed him from the portion of the country most favor- 
able to educational reform to the real center of national public thought and

action and showed him, as he could well read the lesson, that it is only as a whole 
people is lifted up to a higher intelligence, virtue, and executive capacity that a 
erisis such as then confronted the American Republic can be peaceably and 
effectively dealt with. To his friend, Dr. Jarvis, he writes: ‘‘All the kind things 
you say point to what I would do, rather than to anything I have done; indeed, 
what I have done falls so far short of what should have been done, that I feel 
somewhat of an emotion of shame whenever the subject is called to my mind.” 
His best work was now done through frequent opportunities to lecture, and 
among these efforts should be mentioned a splendid address before the Young 
Men’s Mercantile Library Association, in Boston, November, 1849. 
It is interesting to read his estimate of Henry Clay, then near the close of his 
splendid political career, though clothed in the obsolete phraseology of phrenology: 
“T have been studying his head. It is a head of very small dimensions. Benevo- 
lence is large; self-esteem and love of approbation are large. The intellect, for the 
size of the brain, is well developed. His benevolence prevents his self-esteem from 
being oppressive; and his intellect counteracts the action of his love of approba- 
tion, and saves him from an excessive vanity. His vanity, however, has at several 
periods of his life, led him into follies. He derives his whole strength from his 
temperament, which is supremely nervous, but with just as much of the sanguine 
as was possible to put into it. Considering the volume of the brain and the size of 
the head, it has the best adjusted faculties I have ever seen.” 
It is perhaps well for civilization that the average father and mother are nota 
pair of high-strung physiologists, even when a Horace Mann, can deliberately 
write such a sentence as this: ‘‘If men understood their duty, no man would have 
any more children than he could support, educate, and leave in an eligible condition 
behind him, any more than a prudent farmer would have more stock on his farm 
than he could support with profit to himself and with humanity to them. The 
launching of a human being into this world, with a moral certainty of his being 
unhappy and miserable, I regard a far greater crime, in the abstract, than sending 
a human being out of it.” ‘In the abstract” something may be said of such a 
theory. But what family of industrious habits, good character, and fair intelli- 
gence in our country can predict what will be their ability a dozen years hence to 
educate and fairly bring up a family of children? And who can predict that any 
child, however and whenever born into the world, is destined to happiness or 
misery? Certainly, the conclusions of the extreme physiologist put into practice 
in the only way such a theory could be applied, by all sorts and conditions of people, 
would inflict on society a hardness of heart and a combination of personal misery 
and social demoralization compared with which the present errors in family life 
are not to be mentioned. The radical error, and it is a fatal error of much of our 
“practical ” science and the pedagogy derived therefrom, is the notion that there 
is no Almighty love at the center of the universe that watches over the immortal 
life of the least child, and that the eternal destiny of anyone is wholly intrusted 
by Providence to any teacher, parent, or anybody. 
In wide contrast to such extreme speculations we read words that touch a vital 
point in all teaching. ‘‘Can the pupil reproduce what you teach him? This 
is the all-important point in teaching. Has a lesson been solearned that the pupil 
can restate it in words or exemplify it in act, or draw it on the blackboard, etc.” 
He ran against the theological animus at Albany, N. Y., where, after his own 
lecture had been delivered in the church of the famous Dr. Campbell, of whom 
President Andrew Jackson said, ‘‘Dr. Campbell and I can not live in Washington 
together,” the church was closed against the whole course, including Theodore 
Parker, Drs. Orville Dewey and Andrew Peabody, and he writes, ‘‘Isn’t this 
beautiful?” Indeed, for these political capital cities, of which Albany, N. Y., was 
then the most celebrated, he had little respect, After a long course of lectures in 
New York he writes: ‘‘I wish it were possible for some man or men to spread them- 
 
-P-A-G-E-838
  758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
selves over this great State and see that the children are as well taken care of as the 
pigs.” Yet to the last-he extols the Empire State as chief in the Union in its skill 
and zeal in organizing publiceducation. He thinks the girls of western New York, 
as he saw them in their little coeducational colleges, the finest in the country. And 
he was doubtless greatly influenced by what he saw in the splendid country, west- 
ern New York—a ‘‘revised and corrected edition” of New England—to cast in his 
lot with what was even at this late period ‘‘the west,” Ohio. It gave him great 
pleasure to see that, after years of obstinate opposition and ridicule from many of 
the leading teachers of the deaf and dumb in our country, his ideas of instruction, 
put forth in his seventh report, were adopted and largely put in operation. 
' It was doubtless not only politically but controversially a mistake for Mr. 
Mann to carry his opposition to the policy of Daniel Webster to the extremity it 
assumed. But however elevated may have been his motives in this memorable 
controversy, its reaction was the practical close of his political life, and followed 
him like an ominous shadow to his grave. Although reelected to Congress in 
1850, on the rising wave of opposition to the ‘compromise measures,” then on the 
verge of enactment into law, Mr. Mann never seems thereafter to have felt at 
home in Washington. He had fallen upon the reaction that through the North 
preceded the final outbreak of hostility to the slave power, and counsels like his 
were not heeded at the capital. He now seems to have been oftener absent from 
Washington and more given to lecturing. These lectures, on temperance, educa- 
tion, and his favorite theme, loyalty to the divine laws of nature, were eagerly 
sought and were always instructive and powerful. He was greatly interested in 
the effort of Miss Dorothea L. Dix to move Congress to an appropriation of public 
lands for the education of the insane, and although this effort failed, she did 
succeed in obtaining aid for an institution in the District of Columbia. 
in a brief letter to a young men’s debating society in New York he enforces the 
golden rule of all true oratory and debate, that all should be for the furtherance 
of the truth. His coming to Washington in 1851, in his second term in Congress, 
with his family, was signalized by a publication of his antislavery speeches in a 
volume of 600 pages. This session of Congress was chiefly notable for political 
intrigue by the numerous candidates for the Presidency of the United States, 
which resulted in dropping all the prominent statesmen conspicuous in the late 
struggle and nominating Mr. Franklin Pierce, of New Hampshire, and Gen. Win- 
field Scott, of the Army of the United States, as rival candidates. Although ina 
measure favorable to General Scott, the candidate of the Whig party, the interest 
of Mr. Mann in political affairs from that date visibly declined. He was no 
longer in full sympathy with the party to which he had been accustomed to look 
for the most favorable policy in behalf of freedom, and the formation of the Repub- 
lican party was yet six years away. He had been already approached in connec- 
tion with the presidency of Antioch Collego, Ohio. His only venture as a maker 
of schoolbooks was at this period, in a laborious effort to prepare a series of arith- 
metical text-books on a new principle. The idea, as we get it, seems to have 
included or implied the present enlarged method of instruction in mathematics. 
His correspondence with Mr. Downer, of Boston, George Combe, and others on 
public affairs is so rich and illuminating that it is a matter of great regret that we 
have not larger extracts from it in the biography prepared by Mrs. Mann. 
Especially is it little less than a calamity to education that his entire correspond- 
_ ence with Henry Barnard, the only American educator of that period to be com- 
pared in eminence with himself, should have been lost. We do find in a letter of 
introduction of Mr. Barnard to George Combe a whole-hearted tribute to the 
merits of his great colaborer. He writes: ‘If you will put double all the credit 
you have ever given to me and pass it over to Mr. Barnard’s account, you would 
hardly do his extraordinary services more than justice. His mind is full of wis- 
dom, and his life has been full of devotion to this subject.” In February, 1852,
-P-A-G-E-839
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 759 
on a lecturing tour in eastern New York, he first met Rey. Austin Craig, then a 
young clergyman 28 years of age, with whom his whole after life was singularly 
connected, whom he loved as a younger brother, and finally became associated 
with in his work at Antioch College. As already mentioned, about this time, in 
a lecture tour through western New York, his attention seems first. to have been 
seriously attracted to the subject of the coeducation of the sexes in college. In 
several of the higher academical institutions, then misnamed colleges, he found a 
state of affairs that profoundly impressed him and opened new vistas of usefulness. 
From this tour of twenty-five successive nights of public speaking and visitation 
by day he returned to Washington ‘‘in better health than when he left.” 
As early as May, 1852, his attention had been called to the projected establish- 
ment of a college by the religious body known as Christians at Yellow Springs, 
Ohio. Ina letter to Rev. Eli Fay he writes: ‘‘No event of my life has ever caused 
me more deep and solemn anxiety than the applications to become the candidate 
for the presidency of your proposed college at Yellow Springs, Ohio. * * * 
Miss Catharine Beecher prays, if I want any more comfort in this life, that I 
will not try to build up a college at the West, and she says Prof. Calvin Stowe 
held up his hands in deprecation of the thought.” 
But the idea, from the first, had taken a deep lodgment in his heart. He 
regretted that he ‘‘could do no good at Washington.” The return to educational 
work in Massachusetts, after his break with the formidable body of conservative 
influential people in Boston, was practically impossible. The prospect of success 
in any coming change in public affairs was not brilliant, although Charles Sumner 
had been elected to the Senate of the United States by a combination that had 
removed Robert C. Winthrop permanently from public life, to the great advan- 
tage of education by the splendid services of this most accomplished of New 
England statesmen through the closing thirty years of his life as president of the 
Peabody Education Fund. The West, for Ohio was stillregarded a Western State, 
opened the most inviting sphere of activity commensurate with the ability, 
reputation, and aspirations of Mr. Mann. The death of Robert Rantoul, jr., his 
old associate in the board of education in Massachusetts, almost at his entrance 
on a distinguished public career as a Member of Congress, seems to have given 
the final direction to his wavering determination. From this moment his mind 
was more and more engrossed by the thought of the new life beckoning from 
beyond the Alleghanies. On April 15, 1852, the crisis came. Mr. Mann was 
nominated by the ‘‘ Free Democracy” of Massachusetts for governor of the State. 
He received the offer of the presidency of Antioch College, Ohio, on the same day. 
He accepted the latter office without hesitation. This decision finished his polit- 
ical career. For the coming years of his life he was plunged heart and soul in 
his crowning work, which may well be styled the revival of the Western American 
college. 
Horace Mann was in his fifty-seventh year when, on September 15, 1852, he was 
nominated for governor of Massachusetts on an independent political ticket, and 
on the same day accepted the invitation to the presidency of Antioch College, at 
Yellow Springs, Clark County, Ohio. With no abatement of zeal for the political 
opinions for which he had contended with all his might during the four years of 
his Congressional life, he had become fully convinced that tho impending crisis in 
national affairs had not’yet culminated and that as a candidate for governor of 
Massachusetts, doomed to certain defeat and beyond any other public man polit- 
ically obnoxious to the solid conservatism of the State, led by the great Senator, 
Cabinet minister, and Presidential aspirant, Daniel Webster, his status as a poli- 
tician would henceforth be located at zero. And, as if destined to emphasize his 
retreat from public life, about this time he had been drawn into perhaps the 
most exasperating and personal public controversy of his life, with Mr. Wendell 
Phillips, representing the extreme wing of the Garrisonian antislavery movement.  
-P-A-G-E-840
  760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Evidently there was nothing to be done but to turn his eyes to some new phase of 
the educational revival in which he was still acknowledged by all competent 
judges to be the leader who represented most completely the position of American 
educational statesmanship. 
That he accepted the offer of the presidency of what was then a new Western 
college with joy and found in its contemplation a new lease of life can not be 
doubted. The first meeting of the faculty, already elected by the trustees of the 
institution, with the exception of two of his own friends nominated by himself, at 
his residence in West Newton, Mass., was harmonious. He left the State early in 
September, 1853, ‘‘ weeping like a child,” as he turned his back forever on the 
Commonwealth to whose uplift he had consecrated the best years of his life and 
which later placed his statue, erected by the contributions of the school children 
of Massachusetts, on the capitol terrace opposite that of his old antagonist, Daniel 
Webster—fit representatives of the conservative political and progressive educa- 
-tional types of statesmanship by which the Bay State has risen to her present 
exalted position among the Commonweaiths of modern times. 
There was much to attract Mr. Mann to this new field of labor in the West. 
Antioch College was established by the religious denomination of Christians, then 
a numerous and growing body, especially in the region commanded by this its 
first “institution of the higher learning. Yellow Springs, Clark County, Ohio, 
was then a rural hamlet, clustered about a well-known summer resort, in a beau- 
tiful and fertile quadrilateral, inclosed by the Ohio, the two Miamis, and the Mad 
river, 60 miles north of Cincinnati, between the present flourishing cities of 
Springfield and Xenia. It seemed almost an ideal situation for the college, which 
its new president beheld in vision as he set his face toward ‘‘the great West.” The 
institution was situated almost in the center of the most densely populated por- 
tions of the three Western States—Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky—and perhaps more 
central to the constituency he hoped to attract than any locality beyond the Alle- 
ghanies. Good living was very cheap, the climate genial, the natural conforma- 
tion of the country attractive by its scientific interest to the geologist and the 
botanist, easily accessible to the city of Cincinnati, still, in 1853, the center of 
culture in the vast region beyond the mountains. The religious denomination 
that founded it was known as theologically the most progressive among the evan- 
gelical churches of the North and Southwest, with only the Bible as acreed, andan 
increasing section of its younger clergy and educated laity pledged to freedom of 
Scripture interpretation and a progressive policy in the higher education. It had 
been decided that the college should be coeducational and with no distinction of 
race, in these respects perhaps the only considerable foundation of the higher 
education in the West, save Oberlin, Ohio, which had taken that position. It had 
‘also ‘“‘broken the record” as the first of the important Western denominational 
colleges that had elected a layman to the office of president. It had ‘struck 
“twelve” by inviting the foremost common-school educator in America, despite 
his political entanglements, to what must necessarily be very largely the personal 
administration of a new experiment, and he had been permitted to bring several 
teachers of his own selection and to inaugurate his own method of college 
instruction and discipline. 
The present system of free high schools was then hardly established in the 
West out of the cities, and the majority of the academies and colleges of all these 
States of the North and Southwest were strictly sectarian and generally in no 
respect of high reputation. The rising University of Michigan was the only State 
~ university in the Northwest that had attracted the attention of the educational 
East. Never before or since has there been a more interesting opportunity to 
establish a college of the higher grade of ccholarship, free from the trammels 
and traditions that still bound the higher education of the original thirteen States 
- in allegiance to the old British ideals. Only thirty years before, at the University

of Virginia. under the leadership of the venerable Thomas Jefferson, and thirty- 
five years later, in Tulane University, New Orleans, La., under the presidency of 
William Preston Johnston, has such a peculiar opportunity offered itself to an 
American educator. 
All this Mr, Mann appreciated. His twelve years’ service in the revival of the 
common school in New England had trained him in the advanced ideas and policy 
of the elementary, secondary, and normal school. His four years’ service at Wash- 
ington had made him thoroughly acquainted with the progressive and energetic 
spirit of the Northwest and its desire for a higher and broader type of college 
and university life than had hitherto prevailed. He was always unmindful of 
pecuniary reward, though always ridden by an almost fanatical sense of public 
and private pecuniary obligation. This was a serious personal disadvantage 
when his pecuniary interest conflicted with his sacred obligation to the good cause 
of the uplift of the coming American generation. He probably was not suffi- 
ciently informed of the fact that the obstacles to such an enterprise as that in 
which he was now embarked were necessarily greater in the new than in the 
older section of the Union. He went forth to the closing five years of his glorious 
career, which, despite all the disasters and discouraging features in the material 
affairs of Antioch, was perhaps as memorable in its relations to the system of the 
higher education in the West as his earlier and more public work to the common 
school in New England. 
He found the progressive people of the West and Southwest ready to welcome 
him to the leadership in the revival of the higher education in the States tributary 
to Antioch. He was inaugurated as president in October, 1853, His inaugural 
address, of which Thomas Starr King wrote him from Boston, ‘‘ There is vitality 
enough in your inaugural to make a college thrive in Sodom,” was delivered toan 
enthusiastic open-air assembly of 3,000 people. Standing on the front steps of the 
main college building, the already venerable president received a gift of three 
Bibles for the use of the different departments, and in reply set forth in eloquent 
and significant words the idea of the founders of the institution, on which hinges 
the entire history of the higher Christian education in the Republic. The tables 
of the unfinished dining hall were cleared of the fragments of everyday use and 
spread anew with the examination papers of the 150 young people who applied for 
entrance, only 8 of whom were organized into a freshman class. His own scheme 
of administration, as concerned with the courses of study, discipline, and the gen- 
eral management of the educational and religious affairs of the institution were 
accepted. His original plan included a thorough department of pedagogics for 
the training of teachers, the preparatory classes being utilized as a general prac- 
tice school. This arrangement would have placed Ohio at the head of the West in 
this great reform. More than 1,000 young people applied for admittance during 
the first year, representing all the Western and Southwestern States, with a strong 
contingent that had followed him from the Central States and New England. 
That there might be no bar to success on the religious side, Mr. Mann consented to 
the ceremony of baptism and became a member of the Christian denomination, 
thereby assuming the office of college preacher and professor of natural theology 
and philosophy. 
But from the first the new college bore within itself the seeds of financial ruin. 
Like so many of the new schools of the Western and even the older Middle States 
at this period, it had been established on the financial ‘‘delusion and snare,” a 
numerous body of holders of “scholarships,” each of whom had a vote in the 
election of trustees. This small sum of a scholarship of $100 with an indefinite 
payment, and only the annual interest available for the support of the institution, 
was, of course, a foundation of sand, especially as each holder of a scholarship 
was entitled to send a student virtually free of tuition charges. A beautiful 
wheat field of 20 acres had been given for a college campus, and buildings had  
-P-A-G-E-842
  762 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
been projected and partially erected on credit. The Christian denomination was 
comparatively poor and unaccustomed to a canvass for contributions to a seat of 
the higher learning. It was soon evident that from the West little financial aid 
could be expected, as each Christian body in that vast area was already overbur- 
dened with its own enterprises, and the uncertain financial condition reported by 
the administration failed to commend itself to the comparatively few people of 
wealth not already interested in sectarian foundations. 
This is not the place to rehearse the melancholy financial history of Antioch 
College during the few years of the presidency of Horace Mann, notably the years 
when it stood up beyond the Alleghanies as an object lesson in the revival of the 
higher education. Sufiice to say that, after herculean efforts, the president for 
more than a year receiving no salary, the impending failure came upon it in 1857. 
This crisis was ‘‘tided over” until 1859. At the commencement of that year a 
new corporation was formed, largely by the influence of distinguished Eastern 
friends, Rev. Henry W. Bellows, of New York; Dr. Edward Everett Hale, of Bos- 
ton, and eminent laymen representing all portions of the Northern States, with 
timely and efficient support from the churches and people of the Unitarian faith 
in Boston, New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, and Cincinnati. A new board of trus- 
tees was chosen, undenominational in its character, though with a generous rec- 
ognition of the original Christian constituency. Mr.Mann was reelected president, 
and, had his life been spared, the prodigious educational success of Antioch Col- 
lege would for the first time have enjoyed the solid foundation of a reliable financial 
establishment. 
But the earthly service of a twenty years’ leadership in the great educational 
revival of the Republic was finished for Horaco Mann. He died, and with his 
departure his beloved institution gradually subsided into the position of hundreds 
of our new American educational enterprises, though Antioch has always retained 
the radical ideal of its founder. At present, after a varied history, it remains a 
respectable institution of learning, under the management of its original friends, 
chiefly attended by the youth of the Christian denomination in the South and 
West. 
Neither is it profitable to recall the personal trials of President Mann and the 
painful embarrassments of his educational administration by the obstinate jeal- 
ousies and the persistent opposition of adverse elements in the body of adminis- 
tration and instruction. All this is an old, old story in the history of numerous 
American colleges. But apart from the financial weakness, this would not perma- 
nently or seriously have interfered with the final success of Antioch. For Horace 
Mann was no tyro in the arts of public controversy or in the skillful manipulation 
of the varied elements of an administrative educational policy in the face of any 
or all forms of opposition. As it was, he carried his point in every confiict of 
this sort, weeded out of the field the incompetent and hostile members of the 
faculty, and splendidly vindicated his own theory of instruction and discipline. 
Had his life been spared he would have been, under the new management, in the 
full and almost unquestioned possession of an almost despotic control of the col- 
lege. 
As it was, Antioch College has sent forth, as teachers and promising students, 
one of the most reliable groups of young men and women ever graduated from an 
institution of learning beyond the Alleghanies. Four thousand students had 
passed through the college during the five years of President Mann’s administra- 
tion. At its first commencement a larger number of graduates appeared than in 
any of the schools that claimed the title of college in Ohio at a similar age, except 
Oberlin, in the northeastern portion of the State. And it isdoubtfulif any institu- 
tion of learning west of the Alleghanies had, during this period, produced a 
greater number of promising graduates, especially teachers, than this child of the 
professional old age of Horace Mann. Even to-day, a generation from the death
-P-A-G-E-843

of Horace Mann, the writer of these pages in his educational journeyings through 
the Southern and Western States, finds himself often in contact: with eminent 
men and women in all professions who hail from the old Antioch hive. The col- 
lege has sent from its body of professors and students college presidents to Har- 
vard, Clark, and Wellesley, Massachusetts; an acting president to Cornell, in New 
York, and a president to the State University of Ohio, with numerous distin- 
guished college professors, common-school superintendents, and eminent teachers 
in the higher seminaries of learning in many portions of the country. 
The secret of the powerful and peculiar influence of Antioch College is found in 
the character and ideals of its first president, Horace Mann. The Northwest of 
forty years ago had not yet reached the undeniable superiority in the acceptance 
and development of the new education in the common school, and toa remarkable 
degree in the administration of several of its leading universities, which is now 
accorded to it by universal consent. Horace Mann went to Ohio as the best repre- 
sentative of the application of the superior new common-school American ideals to 
the higher education. He went,as a layman, and tohis last day was practically a 
lay educational statesman, standing on a college platform, the president of a coedu- 
cational college which offered even to the proscribed colored race the full oppor- 
tunity of the higher student life. But to few of the leaders of education in these 
vast new Commonwealths was revealed the lofty and broad ideal of college life 
that he brought with him. Theodore Parker wrote to him: “I think Massachu- 
setts had no seed in her granary which the West needed so much as yourself. 
Now God has sent you to Ohio, I look for a great harvest.” That ‘“‘seed” was the 
idea, never before so firmly held and wrought out with such invincible courage by 
the policy of the highest educational statesmanship—that the college and univer- 
sity are not a world by themselves, an educational realm set apart by a superior 
class insisting on a position that virtually leaves the people’s common school a far- 
off, unrecognized region for the use of the ‘‘ common herd.” Antioch College was 
educationally reared, from corner stone to roof, on the broad foundations laid for 
the people’s common school through the dozen years of the powerful and wise 
administration of Horace Mann as the first secretary of the Massachusetts board 
of education. 
The spirit that flowed through it was free, broad, and catholic, thorough as the 
best of old Harvard, but expanded, adjustable, open to every race and both sexes, 
administered by men and women, with a transferal of all the improved methods 
of the common school to the conditions of a college in that portion of the country, 
already, from its magnificent demonstration of ability in affairs, indicated for 
leadership in the coming struggle for the salvation of the Union.” Although the 
original plan for a great department of pedagogics was not realized, the entire 
seminary was perhaps the best general training school for teachers then set up in 
America, President Mann himself characterized it as ‘‘a college with the drill 
of West Point and the methods of the New England normal school.” The result 
was tho graduation of several hundred men and women who everywhere haye 
“struck fire” as leaders in the professional and educational life through vast 
regions of the Republic, and the adoption of the educational spirit and methods 
associated with the career of Horace Mann by all the leading colleges and uni- 
versities of the West. 
But the most notable superiority of Antioch College was the triumphant success 
of the plan of self-government introduced by the president. From the old times 
when corporal punishment was administered at Harvard in the presence of the 
faculty arrayed in cap and gown by the president after a religious service, down 
through the reformed administrations of presidents Dwight of Yale, Nott of Union, 
and Wayland of Brown, there had been a steady growth of the idea that a college 
student is not necessarily an incarnate devil in ambush, on the watch for an 
opportunity for. some novel display of mischief or wickedness, but an average boy,  
-P-A-G-E-844
  764 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
occasionally difficult of management, but accessible to the persuasive power of an 
administration of reasonable authority tempered with fatherly affection, aiming 
at the manly self-culture which is the basis of the highest American citizenship. 
It was reserved for Horace Mann, as the most notable achievement of a life crowded. 
with victories over venerable delusions in education, to inaugurate and carry toa 
complete success a college discipline which was neither more nor less than gather- 
ing several hundred young men and women from the portions of the country least 
accustomed to parental and school control, including many who came with exag- 
gerated and eccentric notions, not only of young men’s and women’s “rights,” but 
of college freedom as ‘‘the right to do what anybody pleases,” and teaching them 
how to become men and women fit to control the destinies of such a country as this 
Union was on the way to become. 
Mr. Mann’s favorite idea of the mischievous influence of school government by 
emulation was the soul of his method. He said: ‘‘ Emulation makes bright 
scholars. but rascally men of affairs.” Almost every morning, at the opening 
religious service of the college, he placed before the assembled students some new 
and often startling illustration of the highest idéal of an education founded on a 
sacred regard for the eternal laws of God, with such eloquence and fitness of 
appeal, such terrible sarcasm over sin and folly, with such splendid encourage- 
ment, aid, and comfort for every good resolution and reputable effort as was 
well nigh irresistible. 
He gathered the members of his lower class about him in his own home, and by 
long and patient argument and entreaty persuaded them to agree to a com- 
bined effort at self-government, truthfulness, and obedience to law without the 
machinery of college spies and proctors and the wearisome conflict of wits between 
student and professor that discipline in so many colleges had become. His most 
difficult undertaking was the effort to change the regulation college idea of 
‘honor ” between students to the belief that their first duty and obligation was 
to the institution of which they were members. This obligation of honor should 
prevail in any matter that threatened the reputation of the college, whatever 
might become of the inclination of the students to stand by one another in the 
concealment of offenses against itslaw. Relentless and threatening as the judg- 
ment day against persistent wrongdoing and matignant opposition, he forbore 
with an almost divine patience with the crude manners, half-digested notions, 
and foolish and disobedient conduct of the weaker members of his little common- 
wealth. 
Stern and resolute, sometimes brusque and even discourteous to his equals and 
opponents, he was always the confiding father of every student. He brought to 
Antioch many of the greatest men of the country as lecturers and visitors, and 
always gave to every student the opportunity of a personal meeting and hand 
clasp-with the distinguished guests. But none of these men could sway, inspire, 
and draw all hearts after him by any spell of eloquence like himself. Many a boy 
sent to him as a final experiment in his education was won over to the right, and 
even those he was compelled to send away were often reformed by their last 
humiliation, and came to revere his memory. He seemed to live in the innermost 
life of every youth intrusted to hiscare. And so mightily did he prevail, that not 
only was Antioch, despite the perpetual malign influence of its enemies, some of 
them on the ground, perhaps the most enthusiastic and loyal body of students in 
the Union, but in the suppression of the ordinary vices of student life it hasnever 
been equaled and, until to-day, never surpassed. With none of the ordinary 
devices of penal government, he succeeded in making his student community 
probably the most orderly, courteous, and agreeable collection of 500 young 
people in Ohio or any State. 
He writes to Samuel J. May in 1858: ‘‘At our first commencement we graduated 
more than the average number of the foremost eleven colleges in Ohio, and, with 
 
-P-A-G-E-845
  
AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 165 
the exception of Oberlin and Marietta, exceeded those of any other at the same 
age. More than 1,000 students have left us, and among them all scarcely one who 
has been with us long enough to imbibe the spirit of the place has left-us a dog- 
matist or a bigot. There is astrong but a sober spirit of attention to religious 
interest among our students. The moral character and conduct correspond. On 
the east side of our grounds, and immediately adjoining them, is a farm of 400 
acres, with gardens, vineyard, and orchards of trees, and on the northwest a large 
flower and fruit garden. On the southwest a Frenchman raises choice fruits for 
the market. Not one of these, for two years, has lost an apple, a peach, or a grape. 
Our dormitory, nearly filled with male students, has no teacher or proctor or over- 
seer. In study hours it is as quiet as your house. We have no rowdyism, no 
drinking of intoxicating liquors, no gambling or card playing, and we have nearly 
succeeded in exorcising profanity and tobacco. . All our faculty, except myself, 
are young (and I feel so), and are well qualified for their places and filled with a 
generous enthusiasm. Two of our professors are ladies.” 
The report of graduates now living canfirms this remarkable statement, such as 
perhaps could not be made by any American college so large, under conditions in 
any way so peculiar. For an entire term Mr. Mann reports that there had been 
no occasion for the discipline of any student. Well might he write in 1858: ‘Our 
educational department has prospered beyond anything I have ever known or read 
of; the financial has been as disastrous as it could be. The college was bankrupt 
on the day it opened.” After the failure of 1857 Mr. Mann himself had under- 
taken to manage its material as well as its educational, moral, and spiritual affairs. 
For two terrible years he labored and prayed and ‘‘endured all things” in the vain 
effort to save the corporation from its fate. When the end came, at the com- 
mencement season in June, 1859, and the whole corporate structure fell, the great 
father and educator who, for five years, had shone in the upper world above it 
‘‘like a star from the East,” blazed into his final transfiguration of the immortal 
life. 
Of course, the peculiar success of the educational department of Antioch 
was the work of the president and the faculty gathered and inspired by him. 
Neither the West nor the East was then or is now capable of adopting in its col- 
lege life a policy so catholic and a spirit at once so tolerant and severe, so effec- 
tive as an education into the loftiest American manhood and womanhood. That 
Horace Mann shortened his life a dozen years by his five years’ administration at 
Antioch College would go without the saying were it not possible that even this 
prodigious strain on all the vital force of his existence may, in itself, have been 
the elixir of life that kept him on his feet. He was to the last a great power in 
the land everywhere through his lecture career, and by his connection with the lead- 
ing colleges in the country the best known educator, although he could not bring 
them to his idea that a student expelled after fair trial should be left by every 
institution as an outcast in the outer darkness of his disgrace. His one visit to 
St. Louis, Mo., resulted in the establishment of a State association of teachers, the 
transferal of his own ablest professor, Mr. Pennell, to the presidency of the St. 
Louis High School and afterwards of a celebrated girls’ seminary connected with 
Washington University, and the founding of a city normal school, which has had 
as its distinguished presidents Dr. Richard Edwards, Miss Anna C. Brackett, and 
Dr. Louis Soldan. The acknowledgment of his power and influence was not 
wanting. He raised up such friends and enthusiastic supporters as Drs. Henry 
W. Bellows, Edward Everett Hale, and a host of the best men and women in the 
land; although his old political opponents in Massachusetts persistently refused to 
support his college by their money and put forth their best effort to verify the 
saying of Little Boston in Dr. Holmes’s ‘‘ Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,” ‘““No 
man ever left Boston that Boston could not spare.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-846
  766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Rev. H. C. Badger, for a time one of the faculty of Antioch College, writes: 
“The impetus with which the mind of Horace Mann smote our minds, rousing us 
and kindling a heat of enthusiasm, as it were, by the very power of that spiritual 
percussion—it was in this that he was so incomparable.” Professor Christy says: 
“To my own mind, I am wont to symbolize the life of Mr. Mann by the figure 
of an ardent and strong youth begirt with the perils and temptations of life, with 
these four sentences engraved around him in characters of flame: ‘What is the 
moral law of the universe?’ ‘What do I know or can know of it, and what does it 
teach?’ ‘That the moral law ought to be obeyed; that the moral law can be obeyed.’ 
‘That moral law I will obey, ruat ccelum.’ Morality as be saw it included what 
other men call religion. For five years he went out and in among us—our teacher 
and adviser, our reproof and encouragement—our father. He came upon our 
educational world like a star out of the east.” A Cincinnati trustee reports that in 
a walk with the president through the glen at Yellow Springs they had lost their 
way and fallen into a slough with apparently neither beginning nor end. Mr. 
Mann called out from the advance, ‘‘ Horace Mann never backs out;” and waded 
onward to dry land. Governor Salmon P. Chase declared: ‘‘ There has never been 
anything like Antioch College in Ohio.” Dr. E. 8. Gannett, colleague and suc- 
cessor of Dr. William Ellery Channing, after a visit to the college, wrote: ‘‘In all 
the particulars that effect a moral and accountable being there neyer has been 
anything to compare with it on this earth.” 
But the end of these twenty years of concentrated work, done in as great peril 
to life as a soldier in battle, was approaching. He had fought the good fight and 
kept the faith. It was the great privilege of the writer of these pages to be pres- 
ent at the last commencement of Antioch College presided over by Horace Mann. 
He was evidently worn almost unto death through all the crowded days of that 
week. There was sickness among his children. The reorganization of the college 
was a work causing great anxiety, as the position of the president was involved. 
The final commencement day was a continuous strain of twelve hours until the 
end of the night reception at the president’s house. I can never forget the spec- 
tacle of Mr. Mann standing at his high desk reading his final address to the 
audience that crowded the spacious chapel almost to suffocation. As he stood 
there, dressed with the exquisite neatness and elegance of ‘a gentleman of the 
old school,” the setting sun almost shone through his wasted frame and lingered 
like a glowing haloabout hishead. One passage, which I do not find in the printed 
address, doubtless the inspiration of the moment, almost a premonition of his own 
approaching departure, on the immortality of the soul, moved me as I have been 
moved by no other argument or eloquence on that exalted theme. 
But the day passed, and the crowd dispersed, with the exception of the few 
students and teachers detained in the village. The weather was torrid, with no 
rain foramonth. The president fell into an alarming condition of exhaustion 
and restlessness. He could not eat or sleep, and only could drink the water 
brought from a distant spring by a relay of students. He shrunk from all noise 
except ‘‘the humming of little George.” The physicians at last united in council 
with a distinguished medical expert from Cincinnati. As he came into the room, 
Mr. Mann, physiological and phrenological to the end, cried: ‘“‘Stop, sir. Let me 
look at you.” After a deliberate survey, he said: ‘I like your head and your 
body. Tell me what you can do for me.” After a brief survey, the doctor left 
the room and told Mrs. Mann that her husband was already dying and could not 
live beyond twelve hours. With a thoughtful self-control, Mrs. Mann replied: 
“Let him sleep if he can to-night, and to-morrow he shall know.” 
In the morning he was told that his end was near. He lifted himself in his bed 
and said: “If that is true, I have work to do.” He called his wife and children to 
his bedside, saying to each of his boys: ‘‘ When you do not know what to do, ask
-P-A-G-E-847
  AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOLS, 1830-1850. 767 
yourselves what Jesus Christ would do in your place.” To all the faculty of the 
college present he gave his parting message concerning ‘‘my beautiful plans for 
Antioch.” Then all doors were thrown open for two hours, and every student and 
everybody who would come was admitted. To each student some word of hope, 
warning, or inspiration was briefly spoken. To one who had been a great trouble 
to him and still was a doubtful case, he said: ‘‘ What will you do with that splen- 
did head of yours? Consecrate it. Let me consecrate it.” And he laid his hands 
upon his brow in a final blessing. 
To his beloved “ Timothy,” young Eli Fay, he said: ‘‘ Preach God’s laws; preach 
them; preach them. Oh, God, may you preach them until the light drives out the 
darkness.” Of Professor Carey, now president of the Unitarian Theological Sem- 
inary at Meadville, Pa., he said: ‘‘Dear Carey—solid, steadfast, well-beloved, 
always wise, always right, always firm—tell him how much Iloved him. Good, 
reliable, firm, gentle, beautiful Mr. Carey. And those good young men who have 
always done their duty, how I love them! Tell them how I love them. No words 
- can explain how I love them.” When asked if he were not exhausting himself, he 
replied: ‘‘No; it rests me.” He saidto Mr. Fay: ‘I should like to have you make 
a short prayer—low, peaceful, grateful.” 
Death came at last, not with bodily peace, but, as he ‘had lived, through hours 
of labor, struggle, and delirium. The strong brain found it hard to die. At last 
God mercifully gave him rest; but death is not the word for such a translation.

CHAPTER XVI. 
HENRY BARNARD. 
By Rev. A. D. Mayo, 
Foremost among the educational leaders during the great revival of the com- 
mon school in the United States which ushered in the second half century of its 
existence under the national life, by common consent, must be ranked Horace 
Mann, of Massachusetts. This notable movement of educational revival and 
reconstruction began in the State which first established the people’s common 
school, in the early colonial period, and had most thoroughly sustained it during 
the first half century of the national existence. And while the State of New York 
did somewhat anticipate this great movement in the establishment, in 1820, of a 
State superintendency of common schools, with some features of improved local 
organization, the subsidizing of academies for the instruction of teachers, and 
the formation of school libraries, yet the establishment of the Massachusetts board 
of education and the appointment of Horace Mann as its secretary placed the State 
of Massachusetts at the head of the reform which lifted the district school of the 
old time to the modern graded school, planted the two first State normal semina- 
ries, set on foot the good work for the general improvement of schoolhouses, 
ingroduced superior methods of instruction, and, above all, secured the exaltation 
of the people’s common school to its present condition as the central and most 
potent factor in the American system of universal education. Through twelve 
memorable years Horace Mann stood before the country beyond all others repre- 
senting that educational statesmanship which is perhaps the most original and 
powerful feature of the American common school. It has seemed well to set forth 
in detail the remarkable work of this great educator, not only in justice to his 
own services, but as an object lesson of what is, in its aim, spirit, and method of 
operation even to-day the most imperative need of the common school through 
half the Union. 
But it is important to understand that another work than that of Horace Mann 
was essential to the complete inauguration of this memorable era in American 
education which, perhaps more than any other influence, is responsible for the 
best elements of our present national civilization. Up to the year 1830 the Ameri- 
can common school had been in a state of transition from the old-time British and 
Continental ideas to its own peculiar status as a vital product of the new Ameri- 
can life, It may in a certain sense be said that the original district school of New 
England was suggested by the system of parochial schools for the people already 
established in Scotland and in some of the nations of the Continent of Europe. 
The New England grammar school was, as far as method of organization and 
instruction went, almost a copy of the private, corporate, and church grammar 
schools in England where the foremost of the leading colonial fathers had been 
educated. 
The one radical difference, however, between the New England common school 
and its European predecessors was that, in all essential respects, it was a people’s 
ED 97 49 ‘i ‘769    
-P-A-G-E-850
  770 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
seminary, established, supported, supervised, and above all filled with the spirit 
of the responsible body of the New England people which from the first created 
the school, church, and state in this corner of the New World. But in process of 
time the common school of New England and of the North had drifted far away 
from its old European models. In every Northern State it had been modified by 
the prevailing opinions and imperative necessities of the time. There was, how- 
ever, a very imperfect knowledge of what was being done among the different 
States that had adopted this method of popular education; and outside a few rather 
feeble attempts, no real cooperation was obtained between its foremost teachers 
and officials. 
Meanwhile a great movement for popular education had come up on the conti- 
tinent of Europe. Led by Prussia and other German States, it had made its way 
to France and invaded the neighboring kingdoms of Holland, Denmark, and Swe- 
den. A vast literature had sprung up around the works of Rosseau, Pestalozzi, 
and the group of voluminous educational writers waked into life by their radical 
theories. And although England has not been prominent as a leader in every 
progressive movement for the fit schooling of the whole people, yet in the British 
Islands, notably in Scotland and Ireland, a remarkable educational literature had 
arisen, 
It was of the first importance that now, when the American people were becom- 
ing thoroughly aroused to the necessity of a complete reorganization of their entire 
system of universal education, they should know what had been accomplished and 
what was being widely discussed elsewhere. While everything in state, church, 
and society that comes to us from abroad must undergo a thorough examination 
and adaptation to the peculiar needs of our republican civilization, it is only a per- 
version and caricature of patriotism that resists the acceptance of the best thought 
and life of all peoples for the enlargement and enrichment of our own. This 
Republic has a claim to all that is good and true which has been achieved by the 
entire experience of mankind. And in no department of the national life is this 
experience more valuable than in the realm of popular education, which is the soul 
of a people’s order of society. 
Even before the period now under consideration, more than is generally under- 
stood, the improved methods of school organization and instruction had been intro- 
duced into the country. Thomas Jefferson and Joseph Cabell, of Virginia, had 
brought from their residence abroad a considerable acquaintance with the uni- 
versity life of the Continent, and Cabell had visited the schools of Pestalozzi. 
Rousseau was no stranger to an increasing circle of readers, for whom the radical 
literature that preceded the French Revolution had great attractions. 
As early as 1817, Judge Archibald D. Murphy, of North Carolina, had presented 
to the legislature of that State an elaborate system of popular instruction, the fruit 
of his studies and observations in the United States and Europe. Many of the 
presidents and professors, especially of the Southern colleges and academies, were 
from Great Britain, and occasionally from the Continent. The Moravian brethren 
of Pennsylvania had introduced the educational ideas of their great bishop, Come- 
nius, in their own denominational schools. Joseph Lancaster had worked and 
died in the United States. Neff had established schools in Pennsylvania and the 
West according to the improved system of Pestalozzi. Mrs. Emma Willard had 
traveled abroad, and brought home advanced methods for the higher education of 
girls. Before the general court of Massachusetts had moved, the legislature of 
Ohio had authorized Prof. Calvin Stowe to make observations in Germany, and 
his account of what he saw there had been published and republished in this and 
several other States. Professor Bache, in the interest of Girard College, Philadel- 
phia, had made one of the most reliable reports of the method of training orphans, 
and the improved elementary and secondary school methods in Great Britain and 
on the Continent. Horace Mann was himself greatly interested and powerfully
-P-A-G-E-851

influenced by what he saw during his short visit to Europe, although hindered in 
his investigations by the lack of a speaking knowledge of the Continental lan- 
guages. Still, no man so correctly as he, at any time, has set forth the radical 
differences between the European and American idea and executive management 
of all classes of schools, a difference so often ignored by numbers of scholarly 
observers since his day. 
The time was ripe in our country for the appearance of a great national repre- 
sentative of the literary side of popular education. There was an imperative need 
of a man of large native capacity, broad culture, and catholic temperament, com- 
petent to gather into his capacious mind the entire condition of educational affairs 
in all civilized lands; a man by birth, education, and social connections com- 
mended to the educated class of the whole country, yet of a patriotism so intelli- 
gent and intense that he should be found ready to cast in his lot as a day laborer, 
and, if need be, a martyr in the supreme cause of the uplifting of the masses in 
this Republic. He should be one who could set before every class of earnest and 
active teachers and educational workers the best results of educational thought 
and activity through Christendom in a form that would strongly commend itself 
to the foremost minds at home and abroad. 
Such a man was Henry Barnard, of Connecticut, the great colaborer and com- 
plement of Horace Mann. It was fitting that the two American colonies which 
had first established the people’s common school, and held fast to it through the 
entire colonial period, should give to the country these two great men, represent- 
ing the segments of the complete circle of the national education: the encyclopedic 
literary genius that set before the public a complete picture of the world’s best 
educational teaching and doing, and the educational statesmanship that planted 
in the conservative soil of New England the reconstructed common school which 
has been adopted as the most precious heritage of that section to the building of 
the new Republic. 
Henry Barnard was born in Hartford, Conn., January 24, 1811, in the home of 
his ancestors, still the home of his old age. At the time of this writing, 1898, 
his age is 87. From his entrance into Yale College at the age of 16, his life has 
been a period of almost incredible activity. During its first half century it was 
largely engrossed in educational superintendence and the supervision of institu- 
tions of learning of all grades. But as the years have gone on he has been more 
occupied in the prodigious labor of building up the great storehouse of educa- 
tional material, which has been declared by the highest European authorities the 
most extensive and reliable literary contribution to general education ever made 
by one man. While it may not be claimed that his labors as an educational 
administrator have surpassed those of others, they have yet been of great 
importance. 
But the especial claim of Henry Barnard to national renown has been the direc- 
tion of his mind to the crowning work of his life—the editorship and often 
authorship of the great American Encyclopedia of Education, the 50 volumes of 
the American Journal of Education. While still, in some ways, the most relia- 
ble authority for what has been done in departments of educational activity 
abroad, the peculiar merit of this vast work is found in the keen and practical 
sense displayed by its compiler in the special manifestations of educational life 
from the earliest years in our own country. Nowhere else can be found such a 
number and variety of interesting monographs respecting the growth of the 
educational spirit and organization in the different States of the Union. While 
diverted from his early determination to write the history of education in our 
country, Mr. Barnard’s collection of material is itself the most complete picture 
of the educational life of a nation in literature. And now, through the prepara- 
tion of an analytical index published by the Bureau of Education, this great
-P-A-G-E-852
  1712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
mass of material has become accessible to every student of our American educa- 
tional history. 
By ancestry, family connection, and personal temperament Henry Barnard was 
a fine representative of the cultivated, scholarly, and literary class of the New 
England of his day. His early training was in the common schools of his native 
city. Although, as he afterwards said, he ‘‘ had spent half his life in outgrowing 
the bad methods of study there formed,” yet he then saw clearly that, below and 
beyond all its defects, the people’s common school had ‘“‘ come to stay” on its own 
merits. Said he: “It is a common school, a school of equal rights, where merit 
and not social position is the acknowledged basis of distinction, and therefore the 
fittest seminary to give the schooling essential to the American citizen.” He pre- 
pared for college in two of the best academies of the time, at Munson, Mass., and 
the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven. He entered Yale College in 1826, 
and graduated four years later, with a fair record for scholarship and an unusual 
stock of general information, gathered by his own use of his college opportunity. 
He early saw through the imperfections of the old-time college curriculum, and 
marked out for himself a sort of extemporaneous suggestion of the broad elective 
training of the Yale University of to-day. He read industriously and intelligently 
through the entire region of English literature, and for two years served as col- 
lege librarian, returning the small salary in gifts of books. He was also very 
active in the literary and debating societiesof the college; and in after life regarded 
his training in these outside departments of his collegiate career as even more valu- 
able than the studies in the regulation classic and mathematical course. Like all 
receptive college students of that early day, when the college presidents and pro- 
fessors were real personalities to the hero-worshiping boy, he found in Professor, 
_afterwards President, Day a ‘‘ guide, philosopher, and friend.” 
After his graduation, at the age of 19, he entered on what he seems to have 
regarded ‘‘ an extensive and costly preparation for the profession of the law;” but 
as his law studies appear to have occupied but two hours of each day and his gen- 
eral reading in classical and modern literature the remainder of his waking hours, 
it is easy to see that the deepest currents of his mind and heart were already set- 
ting strong in the direction of his life work. A term of schoolmastering in an 
academy at Wilkesbarre, Pa., which ‘“‘reminded him of a New England common 
school,” was the occasion for a thorough study of all the accessible literature of 
education. In the autumn of 1835, at the age of 24, he was admitted to the bar. 
The two following years were spent in the most valuable way, as a preparation 
for what was tocome. He traveled—for that time, extensively—through his own 
country, carefully observing men and affairs, his mind full of education, Through 
influential friends he made the acquaintance of Webster, Calhoun, Madison, and 
Marshall, and overlooked with whole-souled interest the great Congressional 
debate of the nullification period in Washington. He went abroad with excep- 
tional advantages; saw Wordsworth, Carlyle, De Quincey, and various notabilities 
on the Continent. His plan to remain in Berlin for an extended study of civil 
law was broken up by the sickness of his father. He returned home and in 1837, at 
the age of 26, was nominated and elected to the general assembly of Connecticut, 
the youngest membez of the legislature that had ever been sent from the staid 
city of Hartford to that body. 
Unlike Horace Mann, Henry Barnard did not graduate from a successful 
practice of the law for a dozen years and a distinguished career in State politics 
to the educational work of his life. Mr. Mann was.a successful lawyer and a 
rising statesman long before he became the first secretary of the Massachusetts 
State board of education, at the age of 41. Mr. Barnard had done nothing save a 
considerable reading of law books, and was in no sense an active politician. But 
at the first of his three terms of service as a legislator he was accepted, by com- 
mon consent of his fellow-members, as the responsible author of a series of
-P-A-G-E-853
HENRY BARNARD. T13 
measures which changed the entire character of the common school of his own 
State and set the copy for a work of revival and reconstruction in popular educa- 
tion which is even to-day only in its transition to what it may become. As a 
legislator his interest was at once attracted to the subjects of prison reform; the 
management of the asylum for the deaf, dumb, and blind, under the direction of 
Rev. T. H. Gallaudet; the rehabilitation of the Connecticut Historical Society, 
with the similar institutions grouped around the central interest of education. 
In a previous review of the history of the common school in Connecticut we 
have told the story of the decline of popular education during the long generation 
following the establishment of the Government of the United States. Up to 1798 
the common school of this State appears to have been the most effective in the 
country. The original colonial system of dependence on the town for the estab- 
lishment, supervision, and partial support of the schools adopted and persisted in 
by Massachusetts had been eminently successful in Connecticut. But about this 
time the State established the first considerable school fund in the new Union— 
$1,000,000 —which thirty years later was increased by the addition of the United 
States deposit fund and good management to $2,000,000, Its annual income of 
more than $100,000 gave $1.25 to each child of school age. But in connection 
with this admirable foundation, the State made a new departure which proved 
one of the most disastrous experiments ever tried in the history of America: 
education. * * 
This was the transferal of the entire management of the common school from 
the town to the ‘school society.” The ‘‘school society ” was, in fact, only the 
Congregational Church, practically made the sole local authority in educational 
affairs. It consisted of all the members of a parish or religious “society,” was 
not limited by town lines, and was entirely separated from ordinary town affairs 
as acted upon in town meeting. The school society had the power to receive the 
portion of the income of the general State school fund annually distributed, at 
first on the basis of the taxable valuation, but after 1823 according to the number 
of children of school age within its limits. It administered the schools by the 
action of all legal voters in special meetings called for that purpose. It was 
empowered to elect a board of visitors, who were authorized to examine candi- 
dates for teaching and to approve the election of teachers by the district authori- 
ties. It could impose a tax for building schoolhouses and could locate them. It 
‘ could divide its domain into school districts, which were empowered to elect the 
local trustees, who selected teachers, subject to the approval of the society, and 
gradually assumed the general management of the schools. The board of visitors 
was required by law to visit and supervise all the schools in their own society, to 
fix the courses of study, and select the schoolbooks. The society was also author- 
ized to establish a secondary or high school, when required, and to report to the 
State authorities concerning the status of education, the proper expenditure of 
funds, etc. 
Here would seem to have been, on paper, a scheme amply sufficient to insure 
successful school-keeping, especially when backed by the annual distribution of 
more than $100,000 to a school population of some 80,000, with power to tax for 
schoolhouses, a local right of taxation and a practice of assessing a pecuniary 
school deficit on the patrons of the schools. But the fatal error of the scheme 
was the switching off the common school from a great public interest, to be dealt 
with like other matters of high public concern by the people in open town meet- 
ing, upon a sidetrack, where it was managed as an interest apart by peculiar 
methods. 
Just how this peculiar system of public school affairs, known as the ‘school 
society,” was manipulated,in the practical administration of popular education 
during the long generation between this new departure and the opening period of 
educational revival, 1830-1840, is still a question among authorities equally uncer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-854
  T74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tain and equally confident. On the one hand it has been inferred, largely by infer- 
ence from the elaborate historical reports of Dr. Barnard, that the root of the 
difficulty was the transferal of authority from the colonial practice of adminis- 
tration of school affairs by the whole people in open town meeting to a peculiar 
organization, the school society, either identical with or in some way character- 
istic of the early relations between ecclesiastical and public affairs, closely involved 
with the “ parish ”—the religious Puritan, afterwards the Congregational, Church 
organization of Connecticut. This movement practically removed the manage- 
ment of the schools from a concern of high public importance to the charge of a 
separate organization. And, although the members of the school society were 
also members of the parish churches, and presumedly the entire body of respon- 
sible citizens, yet it must be evident that here was a perilous opportunity for that 
peculiar internecine conflict between the clergy and the more zealous churchmen, 
representing the ecclesiastical, and the increasing body of the people who, at a 
later period than in Massachusetts, were becoming restless over the great influ- 
ence of their spiritual leaders during the entire colonial period. 
During the colonial period of more than a century the dominant church and 
clergy of the colony had wrought in full accord with the people in the common 
school, in which the Westminster Catechism was a text-book and the theology of 
the only existing church the basis of its moral and religious instruction and dis- 
cipline. There is no doubt that the bitter conflict between the clergy and the 
masses of the people concerning the use of the State educational fund, at first 
divided between the churches and the schools by a statute soon afterwards repealed 
through a revolt of public opinion, left the ecclesiastically inclined portion of the 
community indifferent or opposed to public education. It is held, as before stated, 
that the subsequent transferal of administration to the school society was due to 
the ecclesiastical party, who, by making the parish and the society identical, were 
able to control the schools, limit their income to the revenue derived from the 
State school fund and reduce them virtually to an inefficient arrangement for the 
elementary instruction of the majority, while building up for the secondary and 
higher education of the more favored class the system of private and denomina- 
tional academies which, with Yale College, by 1837 had forced the celebrated public 
school of the colonial period into a corner, fighting a desperate battle for existence. 
Another explanation of the situation is that the movement was inaugurated by 
the same disaffection of the masses which brought about the repeal of the obnox- 
ious law for the division of the State fund. Asa result, the clergy largely with- 
drew from common-school management, leaving educational matters in the hands 
of the disaffected laity. The schools lost the influence of the clerical and cultivated 
class and fell into the hands of the ordinary local managers of political and public 
affairs, whose “‘ strong hold ” is a rage for the economy that believes in knocking 
out the brains of things to save money. In this way it was easy, during an entire 
generation, to persuade the masses, who were unable to take advantage of the pri- 
vate schools, that the generous expenditure of the State educational fund was 
ample for their needs, and thus shirk the responsibility of local taxation to supple- 
mentit. So, gradually, more and more, the common school of Connecticut was 
left as a sort of educational ‘‘ house of refuge ” for the poorer class; and,as a school 
for the poor in our country generally becomes a poor school, the decline went on 
apace. 
It can only be through a far more accurate investigation and clearer under- 
standing of the peculiar relations of the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of this the 
most peculiar of American Commonwealths, during the first half century of the 
national life, that the causes of this decline can be clearly understood. One point 
is clear—that no effective system of public instruction in any American State can 
be supported from the income of a State school fund, even when supplemented by 
a State tax. These years cover the first great movement of the State from a Brit-

HENRY BARNARD. T15 
ish colony to an American Commonwealth, when the introduction of manufactures 
and the consequent growth of large villages and cities made the sum of $1.25 per 
capita a year a miserable pittance even for the old-time rural district school, to 
say nothing of the free secondary education. Another point is evident—that the 
clerical and cultivated classes during these years were at odds with the public 
school, and gave their influence and money largely to the building up of a rival 
system of private and denominational education. Whether this class actually 
discredited the common school through its own administration, or ‘sulked in its 
tent” and left the “‘common folk” to manage affairs without experience in educa- 
tional administration according to their own narrow ideas of public economy, is 
the point in dispute. But there is no dispute that between the church and the 
State stools the people’s common school fell to the ground and lay there until, 
aroused by the shout of the great revival from 1830 to 1860 under the leadership 
of Henry Barnard and a group of admirable coworkers, it literally staggered 
upward to the improved condition in which it was found at the breaking out of 
the civil war. 
In 1837 an investigation by a legislative committee showed that not one-half of 
the children and youth of school age, 4 to 16, were in regular attendance on the 
common schools, and that the schools themselves were in a condition satisfactory 
to nobody. Of the 1,200 schoolhouses, only 300 were pronounced suitable, and 
more than half practically unfit for occupation. Large numbers of them were in 
an almost incredible condition in sanitary arrangements, often an outrage to 
common decency. There was no regularity of school attendance; no real exami- 
nation of teachers; a general neglect of all legal requirements for supervision, 
visiting schools, or arranging courses of study. Two hundred varieties of school- 
books made ‘‘confusion worse confounded.” The 1,200 teachers were a ‘‘ dissoly- 
ing view” of men in winter and women in summer, the men receiving $15 and 
the women $6 to $8 per month, besides very cheap board; the large majority of them 
‘‘poarding round” in the families of the district to save the board bills. Not one- 
fourth of the teachers in any term continued beyond the year in charge of the same 
schools. Thore was no pretense of any attempt for the professional instruction of 
teachers, apart from such meager general education as they could gain in the com- 
mon schools and an occasional termat theacademy. Nota dozen common schools 
in the State were furnished with libraries and school apparatus. Not a district or 
society in the open country, where nine-tenths of the children were schooled, 
imposed a tax for supplementing the State fund, and not one made an annual 
-report to the State. The duty of the commissioner of the State school fund seems 
to have been confined to sending to each school society its proper quota, of whose 
use there was little report. Indeed, there was no general knowledge, either public 
or private, of the condition of public education. The school society meetings for 
the choice of officers and transaction of business were sparingly attended and often 
acted without a quorum. The superior people of the community, more and more 
shirked the office of school visitor. 
The whole situation was summed up in the repeated complaints of a general 
public apathy concerning the common school. The people who used it, or did not 
care to school their children anywhere, appeared to be satisfied, and supposed 
Connecticut, educationally, was still at the head of the country. It was almost 
impossible for the legislative committees to obtain information, the school socie- 
ties often refusing to report their own inefficiency. In short, from the foremost 
in colonial days Connecticut had fallen nearly to the rear among the States that 
had in good faith established the common school. 
Meanwhile the people of wealth, social influence, and superior education were 
more and more estranged from this apology for a common-school system. Every 
community of a hundred people had a private school. Yale College was still 
among the half dozen leading colleges of the land, under the direction of eminent  
-P-A-G-E-856
  776 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
educators in the persons of a remarkable series of great presidents and able pro- 
fessors, sending forth graduates to lead the growing life of the Republic beyond 
the valley of the Hudson. 
The academies were often good. Twelve thousand pupils were educated in 
them, at an annual expense of $200,000—more than the entire sum expended on 
the remaining 50,000 children in the common schools. From 6,000 to 8,000 chil- 
dren were in no school. 
The laws for the protection of children in manufacturing establishments were 
persistently disregarded. The State was not behind in the higher walks of profes 
sional ability. It was sending to other States distinguished educators like Manas 
seh Cutler, Dr. Nott, and Emma Willard, and men like Wadsworth, Hawley, and 
others, who were identified with educational progress everywhere from the Atlan- 
tic coast to the valley of the Mississippi. But all things educational seemed 
drifting toward an aristocratic order of society in Connecticut, which boasted 
itself the most democratic of States, a Commonwealth of 300,000 people, where a 
small body in the upper story manipulated the administration of affairs and left 
the masses to feed on the crumbs that fell from the tables of their betters. 
A great professional, educated, or ‘‘most favored” body of people will always 
be inclined to build up the type of schooling most agreeable to itself and do no 
more for the masses below than it is compelled. 
The higher interests of American life move along political and not social or 
ecclesiastical lines. No interest so fundamental to the State and of such impera- 
tive necessity to the people as the common school can safely be left in charge of 
any constituency less powerful and influential than the whole people, where the 
lower orders, who most require the influence of good schools, work in connection 
with and under the leadership of the superior class. 
The feeble attempt at a recent period to charge this dismal failure of the 
common school in Connecticut for nearly half a century to the blighting effect 
of ‘‘national aid to education” is disproved by the fact that there was no 
national aid to the State during the period of greatest educational decline. It 
was demonstrated there that it is always and everywhere a mistake to rely on 
State or national aid for the entire or the major factor of the support of common 
schools. But the obstinate reliance of the people of Connecticut on their State 
school fund for an entire generation was due to the mischievous switching of its 
fundamental institution from the ‘‘main line” to a ‘‘side track.” It was a com- 
plete demonstration to the country that no State can safely rely on the church of 
any creed, or on its own educated class, or on its own higher institutions of 
learning, for a just and adequate arrangement for the education of the whole 
people. Only as the whole people are responsible for the schooling of the chil- 
dren for the opportunities of American life, and insist that the best school is 
never too good for the least child, will the common school do its appointed work 
as the soul of the Republic. 
But through all this dreary season of the neglect and decline of popular educa- 
tion there was left in Connecticut a powerful and intelligent educational public 
that thoroughly understood the situation. It was rather from the lack of organi- 
zation and wise leadership, as we have already shown, than from indifference that 
things were not earlier mended. That the general assembly, with the executive 
department of the State government, acted with such remarkable unanimity and 
vigor as soon as the fit man appeared to take the initiative, is proof that the time 
was ripe for the man. 
The story is now to be told of the enactment of a revised school law and the 
appointment of Henry Barnard in 1838 as the virtual superintendent of public 
instruction in Connecticut. It was a most remarkable demonstration of an early 
recognition of the genius and worth of a rising man in this, the most important 
department of public affairs.
-P-A-G-E-857
  HENRY BARNARD. TT 
And the man was already there in young Henry Barnard. By common consent 
the flower of the best culture of his State and time, to whom all men were looking, 
he added to his numerous talents and accomplishments that spirit of consecration 
which is the one essential characteristic of the genuine reformer. He had already 
put on record the inspiring declaration, ‘‘So far back as I have any recollection, 
the cause of true education—of the complete education of every human being with- 
out regard to the accidents of birth or fortune—seemed most worthy of the conse- 
eration of all my powers, and, if need be, of any sacrifice of time, money, and labor 
which I might be called upon to make in its behalf.” At the close of his remark- 
able speech, which, without further debate, carried the legislature almost as a 
unit in the support of the school law of 1838, he said, ‘‘ Here, in America, at last 
no man can live for himself alone. Individual happiness is here bound up with 
the greatest good of the greatest number. Every man must at once make himself 
as good and as influential as he can and help, at the same time, to make every- 
body about him and all whom he can reach better and happier. The common 
school should no longer be regarded as common because it is cheap, inferior, and 
attended only by the poor and those who are indifferent to the education of the 
children, but common as the light and the air, because its blessings are open to 
all and enjoyed by all. That day will come. For me, I mean to enjoy the satis- 
faction of the labor, let who will enter into the harvest.” 
It is easy to be seen that the problem set for the young educational reformer of 
Connecticut was essentially different from that which confronted Horace Mann 
in Massachusetts a year before. For the common school of Massachusetts, 
although under a cloud of neglect, had never been derailed from the “‘ through 
track” of direct public control. Every town and city had complete oversight of 
its own system of public instruction. It is true that the direct influence of the 
town and city had been greatly weakened by the extreme subdivision of these 
communities into school districts and the growing habit of leaving too much 
power in the hands of the prudential committee of the local school. But the town 
still elected a school committee, which was responsible for the general welfare of 
the schools and the examination of teachers; and, above all, the habit of direct 
local taxation for the free education of all had been established and never lost. 
Besides, the leading minds and the clergy in Massachusetts were more in sympathy 
with the common school than in Connecticut. It was easy for Secretary Mann to 
summon a group of men, distinguished in national affairs, to the hearty public 
supportof his plans. Governor Edward Everett and Daniel Webster, Dr. William 
E. Channing, Dr. George Putnam and Rev. Caleb Stetson, John Quincy Adams, 
Governor George N. Briggs, and Robert Rantoul, jr., with the host of men of all 
professions highest in the esteem of the Commonwealth, cheerfully responded to 
the call to attend conventions, speak and write, and in all possible ways stand up 
for reform in the common school. 
There was also a group of educational men, teachers and laymen like George B 
Emerson, Carter, Brooks, Sam. J. May, Cyrus Pierce, and President Humphreys, 
connected with academical schools and colleges, who cooperated heartily with the 
great educational statesman, toiling sixteen hours a day in the little Tremont 
street office of the secretary of the board of education. The chief work to be done 
was to wake up the masses of intelligent people, nowhere so eager to listen and 
ready to respond to the call to ‘‘go up higher” as in the Old Bay State, and 
through the cooperation of a friendly legislature to drive the chariot of educa- 
tional reform with a free hand. And there-was then, as now, in Boston and other 
cities of the State a body of generous-minded people of wealth ready to back any 
wise effort in behalf of philanthropy, education, or religion. 
But the radical difficulty in Connecticut was that, for a long generation, the 
educational train had been switched off from the direct track of a public interest 
dealt within the forum of the town meeting to the side track of a ‘‘school society.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-858
    778 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Under these cireumstances it was not strange that while Henry Barnard did 
find a strong support and high appreciation from many of the leading men of the 
State, like Governor Ellesworth, Dr. Horace Bushnell, and, later, Noah Porter, 
afterwards president of Yale College, yet the educated and superior class was not 
prepared to look with favor on his radical plans for the complete reconstruction of 
popular education. The stolid apathy among the masses of the people who still 
relied on the common school for their own children was not at once to be broken 
by the appeals and efforts of a scholarly, catholic, amiable young official, hitherto 
known only asa promising college graduate fresh from his foreign travels and 
ambitious of distinction as a public-school reformer. Indeed, it would have then 
been a hopeless undertaking to attempt to break up the school society, the radical 
weakness of the system. Dr. Barnard did not attempt this and, through the four 
years of his first term as secretary of the State board of school commissioners, 
seems to have studiously avoided that, the central point of attack. 
His work was to visit the people in as many of the 140 towns as was possible; to 
inspect the schools; to become acquainted with the influential friends of popular 
education; to make numerous addresses; to awaken the attention of school visitors 
and teachers by a veritable shower of elaborate circulars of inquiry and suggestion, 
in themselves a valuable treatise on the new education; to write the series of educa- 
tional reports that are still among the most reliable literature of the common school, 
and in the new Connecticut School Journal to begin the vast work of the gathering 
and publication of material for the teachers, the educational public, and the his- 
torian which we find complete in his great educational library, the American 
Journal of Education. 
In general terms it may be said that the most reliable results of his administration 
were, first, the unmasking of the situation by the waking up of the latent hostility 
against the common school to an open declaration of war. This manifestation 
came to a head in 1842 in the report of a legislative committee which led toa 
reversal of the policy of 1838. This action first opened the eyes of the educated, 
influential, and patriotic people of the old State to the peril of their Common- 
wealth. Second, from this awakening there came up a genuine ‘‘ common-school 
public,” which, although not prepared to follow Mr. Barnard’s suggestion on retir- 
ing from office of combining in a ‘‘Connecticut institute of instruction,” did, at 
last, find itself, and eight years later recalled the defeated secretary and placed 
him again at the head of a system of public schools which has gradually outgrown 
its old defects and to-day is among the most effective in the Republic. 
From the first there appears in Mr. Barnard a strong disinclination to oceupy the 
public positions of great administrative responsibilities into which he was repeatedly 
thrust, though always somewhat under protest. He favored the appointinent of 
Rev. T. H. Gallaudet, then at the head of the institution in Connecticut for the 
education of the deaf, dumb, and blind, as secretary of the State board of com- 
missioners, believing him the most competent educator in the country. He even 
roposed to contribute money and influence to raise a fit salary for the office. 
Failing in this, he only consented to occupy the post of secretary for six months, 
without salary, and twice before 1842 urged his own resignation upon the unwill- 
ing board. His service during this entire term of office was pecuniarily as well 
as spiritually ‘‘a labor of love.” He contributed to the cause as much as he 
received from the State. Indeed, he finally impoverished himself by his persistent 
contributions of money to the cause of education, largely by the publication of his 
great journal; never a popular magazine, for the same reason that an elaborate 
encyclopedia can not be made a popular periodical. 
But the fact that his first appearance as one of the youngest members of the gen- 
eral assembly in 1837 and the manner in which he swept the entire legislature to 
the passage of the reformed school law of 1838, which, under the modest title 
“An act to provide for the better supervision of common schools,” was in reality
-P-A-G-E-859
  HENRY BARNARD. 179 
‘*the commencement of a new era in the history of popular education of Connecti- 
cut,” proves that there was a widespread sentiment against this policy of educa- 
tional neglect and thata great expectation was awakened by the appearance of the 
fit man to lead in the policy of reform. The law passed the legislature almost unani- 
mously after the one speech in the house of representatives by its author. From that 
remarkable speech can be gathered the entire programme of educational reform 
inaugurated by the great revival whose history we now rehearse. Dr. Barnard 
did not hesitate to lay his finger on the most sensitive spot in the controversy 
when he made ‘‘a forcible presentation of the needs of superior teaching, showing 
how the colleges and seminaries had made no preparation for it.” 
The law as passed, like the previous statute in Massachusetts, established a 
State board of ‘‘commissioners of common schools,” consisting of the governor, 
the commissioner of the State school fund, and eight gentlemen representing the 
eight counties of the State. It is significant that President Wilbur Fisk, of the 
Wesleyan University, was one of the commissioners, while Yale does not seem to 
have been thus recognized. In Governor Ellesworth and Hon. Seth P. Beers, com- 
missioner of the State school fund, the new secretary especially found a wise and 
persistent support. 
The law provided that the duties of the beard of school commissioners should 
be: (1).To ascertain the actual condition of the common schools of the State; 
(2) to keep the legislature informed of their condition by abstracts and reports, 
and to suggest plans for the improved organization and administration of popular 
education; (3) to visit the different counties of the State, through its secretary 
address the people, inspect the schools, and generally stir up the teachers, visitors, 
and other officials; (4) to edit a journal of education devoted especially to the 
cause of the common school. 
The whole duty of the board may be summed up in the comprehensive title: A 
ministry of education in behalf of the people’s common school, under the direction 
of the State. Like the Massachusetts State board of education, it had of itself no 
authority to do anything decisive in the change of existing affairs. But in New 
England this type of commission is always the most powerful lever for the uplift 
of any good public institution, as proved by the experience of the past sixty years. 
The way for the passage of the law had been prepared by such a partial report of 
the status of the common schools as could be obtained from an investigation by the 
committee of the legislature in 1837. Dr. Barnard, before the assembling of the 
legislature, had addressed a printed circular to every member of the general assem- 
bly, calling attention to the revelations of this report and urging prompt action. 
The first act of Dr. Barnard after the organization of the State board was the 
publication of an elaborate address to the people of the State, the work of the 
secretary himself. With the true New England official habit, he hastens to disa- 
buse the public mind of the idea that the board has any disposition or power to 
exercise authority upon anybody. Itis simply a convenient arrangement to inform 
the people of the actual condition of their schoolaffairs. ‘‘No inquiry of this sort 
has, as yet, been thoroughly and satisfactorily made. There has been no effective 
instrumentality for making it. The investigations, at numerous times attempted, 
have been very incomplete.” Dr. Barnard goes on with admirable tact to appeal 
to the hereditary pride of the State in its educational affairs, to pay a well-deserved 
tribute to its fame in colonial days, and to suggest that, of late, while many Com- 
monwealths and nations at home and abroad are waking up to a new interest in 
the education of the whole people, Connecticut must not be left behind. 
In this respect the educational policy of New England has always been some- 
what in contrast with that of New York. The Empire State, from the first, has 
relied greatly in education as in politics on the power of eminent leaders in com- 
manding public station. The original creation of a ‘‘ board of regents of the 
University of New York,” which practically took all education for its province, 
 
-P-A-G-E-860
  
  780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
implied an authority far more extensive than it has ever been able to use. Later, 
the State established the office of State superintendency of common schools in 
1820. The transfer of this office to the secretaryship of state brought to the serv- 
ice of the schools many of the ablest public men. Later yet, the scheme of 
supervision was carried out in the appointment of city and county superintendents 
with unusual powers. But experience seems to have testified that the New Eng- 
land idea of educating the whole people into their duty of instructing the children 
by vigorous direct local taxation for a local control of the common schools has 
been most effective. Still, New York has given the country a lesson so attractive 
in its idea of a concentrated State control of education that Mann and Barnard 
were moved to laudation of the State as the most progressive in the world in its 
public policy concerning the schooling of the people. 
This circular was followed in July, 1839, by the first report to the legislature from 
the State board. It was the first thorough, elaborate, and reliable unveiling of 
the actual condition of public-school affairs to which the people of Connecticut 
had been treated ‘‘ within the memory of the oldest inhabitant.” Chancellor Kent, 
of New York, in his Commentaries of American Law, says of it: ‘‘It is a bold and 
startling document, founded on the most painstaking and critical inquiry, and 
contains a minute, accurate, comprehensive, and instructive exhibition of the 
practical condition and operations of the common-school system of education.” It 
was not a brilliant discussion of educational theories, although, with the most 
unsparing criticism of present conditions and methods, the author puts forward 
_the remedy in what amounts to a complete scheme of reformed public instruction 
founded on the most advanced ideals. Neither was it a public document made 
up at an official desk from reports, more or less accurate, by irresponsible officials. 
During the first year of his administration the secretary had literally ‘“‘stumped” 
the State. Its extent and population, not exceeding 300,000, with 141 towns, was 
favorable to the system of minute local visitation, which Secretary Northrope 
afterwards carried to an almost ideal perfection. Secretary Barnard reports that 
hehad ‘‘attended school conventions in all the 8 counties, addressed 60 public meet- 
ings, inspected more than 200 schools, consulted with two-thirds of the teachers 
of the State, and superintended the publication of the new Connecticut School 
Journal, more than 60,000 copies of which had been circulated during the year.” 
From the best information it had been learned that of 67,000 children and youth 
between 4 and 16 only 54,000 had looked in at the door of the common-school 
house, with only 42,000 in regular attendance; that 12,000 children (of the better- 
off class) in private schools and academies were costing their families $200,000 more 
than the entire sum expended on the remaining 55,000, and that at least 8,000 were 
in no school whatever. But one school society had made a report through its 
school visitors to the State before 1838. It was exceedingly difficult to obtain 
accurate information concerning the schools. The public meetings of the school 
societies were thinly attended and officers frequently elected when no quorum was 
present. The length of the school term depended on the salary of the teacher. 
The teachers were rarely examined with any degree of thoroughness, the schools 
were not supervised, and matters were conducted with constant disregard of the 
school laws. The schools were often suspended in winter for lack of fuel, which 
the people were expected to supply in lieu of a rate bill. It was difficult to point 
at a single model schoolhouse in the State. There was no uniformity of school- 
books, and primary instruction was greatly neglected in the multiplicity of studies. 
There was no attempt at the efficient grading of schools, the children of all ages 
being placed under the charge of one teacher, whose life was literally a race 
through a series of brief lessons from day to day. There was no considerable 
class of trained teachers, and apparently little sense of the need of professional 
training for the teacher by the secondary and collegiate seminaries. 
The irregularity of attendance and constant change of teachers amounted to a
-P-A-G-E-861
  HENRY BARNARD. 781 
practical waste of the school money. No country and but few city districts sup- 
plemented the regulation appropriation of the State fund, $1.25 per capita, by alocal 
tax. The frequent deficit was assessed on the patrons of the schools, often making 
it as expensive to educate a child in the public as in a private school. The 
extreme division of the school society into districts and the neglect of the visitors 
to attend to their duty of supervision left the common school of many little ham- 
lets, as of many city wards, in almost as complete isolation as if located in a dark 
closet, in no elbow touch with a neighboring school. All the difficulties of the 
school society weré summed up in the existence of a public apathy concerning 
public-school education, which made attempts at reform almost hopeless. Indeed, 
this public apathy somewhat accounts for the unanimity of the legislature in 
passing the laws under the lead of Secretary Barnard, The legislature did not 
know the people, and it was four years before the people, who were apparently 
satisfied with this condition of affairs, were sufficiently waked up to inaugurate a 
reaction which ‘‘swept from the statute books in one month all the measures of 
the State for improvement.” 
There was no lack of suggestions for the cure of this great infirmity of the 
Commonwealth. Secretary Barnard’s reports for the remaining three years of his 
administration abound with practical directions for better schoolhouses, uniform- 
ity of schoolbooks, the enforcement of their official duty on the school visitors, 
the just and equal distribution of school money, the necessity of local taxation, 
the proper grading of schools, with the establishment of free seminaries for sec- 
ondary instruction. Great stress was laid on the reformation of the present corps 
of teachers, literally a “dissolving view” of young men working at $15 and 
women at $6 to $8 per month, ‘‘ boarding round,” flitting ‘“‘from pillar to post,’ 
often with the best intentions ignorant of the first principles of instruction and 
wedded to the old hatefyl style of severe discipline. In the Connecticut Journal 
of Education, established, edited, and practically supported by the secretary, he 
published a vast amount of valuable material about the conditions of popular 
education at home and -abroad, in addition to several valuable treatises on 
instruction, with ample suggestions on all departments of school keeping. 
It is unnecessary to follow the indefatigable young reform secretary through 
the almost incredible labors of the four years of this administration. His entire 
days and most of his nights were given to his work. As far as present effect on 
the public mind is considered, it is probable that the literary side of the work was 
overdone. No people on earth in such a state of educational opinions and prac- 
tice as the people of Connecticut appear in these tremendous reports would long 
endure the humiliation of being published abroad through all the world after the 
style of this terrible ‘young man among them taking notes.” Much of the liter- 
ature thus launched upon the State during this period in the form of reports, arti- 
cles in the journals, circulars, and voluminous educational inquiries by the secre- 
tary would be lost upon the average teacher. Indeed, these elaborate circulars 
of questions addressed to the boards of visitors and teachers were enough to 
“scare the wits out of ” their astonished recipients; a sort of judgment-day sum- 
mons to a style of professional thinking and activity for which they were abso- 
lutely incompetent. 
The secretary did prevail on the legislature to pass several acts in the direction 
of reform, and, in 1841, a general codification and revision of the school laws was 
made. Several towns and cities were aroused to vigorous action; Farmington, 
Middletown, and Salisbury among the foremost. Dr. Horace Bushnell, of Hart- 
ford, himself a host, came to the rescue in a tremendous onslaught upon the con- 
dition of the common schools in the chief capital city. But the radical difficulty, 
the school society organization, couldnot bereached. The best system of improved 
pedagogics would fail of effect under such incompetent administration. 
To the outside world the State of Connecticut now seemed embarked on a grand
-P-A-G-E-862
  782 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
voyage of educational reform. Henry Barnard at once shot up into a national 
reputation, and was largely quoted abroad. His reports passed rapidly into the 
realm of educational literature, in many respects the best in the country. Defi- 
cient in the great administrative power of Horace Mann; not always accurate in 
his knowledge of men and reading of public opinion; not, indeed, a politician, but 
a splendid scholar and an earpest advocate of the best theories of education before 
the whole country, he was doomed to the supreme disappointment and mortifica- 
tion of seeing his entire educational fabric demolished on the advent of an oppo- 
sition party to power in 1842, It is doubtful if the administration of Governor 
Cleveland rightly interpreted the will of the people in this complete overturn of 
the work of the past four years. But so it was to be. In 1842 Henry Barnard 
found himself politically ‘‘out in the cold” in his own State. The entire code 
of school legislation with which his name and fame were associated was repealed. 
His work was generally disparaged and discredited, and the old‘-Commonwealth 
seemed on the point of returning to ‘‘the fleshpots of Egypt” for another gen- 
eration. 
But no effort so consecrated, so forcible, so far-secing in theory and practical in 
its application to present needs goes for naught anywhere, especially in a com- 
munity so accessible to high ideals and good works as the people to whose interest 
this great apostle of education had devoted his life. Apart from the impulse given 
to many separate schools and to individuals in full or partial sympathy with his 
labors, Secretary Barnard had, for the first time in half a century, gathered 
together a common-school public which ever after could be relied on to further 
any reform of which a Commonwealth so conservative and cautious is capable. 
His proposition, at the close of his term of office, to unite this group of people in 
a general voluntary organization—‘‘ The Connecticut Institute of Instruction ”— 
was a failure. But the common-school public of Connecticut was growing in a 
natural and decisive way. The foremost member of the party responsible for the 
reactionary legislation now revolted and made common cause with the friends of 
popular education of every sect, class, and condition. Their first effort was to 
check the present downward tendency; the second, to gather up the remains of 
Secretary Barnard’s administration into a working policy that should effect his 
tecall to power and set the common school forever on its upward way. 
In 1844, two years after the reaction, Governor Baldwin again called attention 
to the unsatisfactory condition of the common schools of the State, and spoke in 
high appreciation of the labors of Secretary Barnard whereby ‘‘a new impulse 
had been given to the cause of education.” The legislature responded by author- 
izing the governor to appoint a committee of nine persons for a new investigation, 
with an appropriation for necessary expenses. 
This committee made an elaborate report, probably written. by Commissioner 
Beers, of the State school fund. It opened with a hearty indorsement of the 
work of Henry Barnard and the State board of commissioners from 1837 to 1842, 
when ‘operations were begun which promised to carry our State forward in the 
cause of popular education—and whose effects are still visible in many places— 
although the result of this great effort has filled many of the friends of education 
with despair.” The supervision of the schools had already fallen away from what 
had been achieved in 1842, All the old deficiencies were still present, even that 
invariable evidence of a low state of public interest in the schools—‘ the absence 
of decent outbuildings to the schoolhouse.” The general want of interest in the 
educational training of the children ‘‘seems to be the crowning defect, or rather 
the foundation, of all the evils connected with the schools.” The secret of the 
mischief is distinctly located in the school society. Only 59 of 214 of them had 
made any return to the questioning of the legislative committee. Thereport con- 
cludes with the statement: ‘“‘No great change in the system can be introduced at 
present with fair prospect of success. One fatal deficiency seems to be that the
-P-A-G-E-863
HENRY BARNARD. 783 
schools are in politics, and the machinery of one party seems to have been cap- 
tured by the reactionists, or it may have fairly represented the numerical majority 
of the people.” 
But the committee did not leave their task without the suggestion of a policy 
that effectually ‘‘blocked the wheels” of the educational chariot, arresting it at its 
present downhill route. Two practical measures were suggested. First, that a 
permanent State official should be given such duties of the former secretary of 
the board of commissioners as he might be able to perform. Second, that every 
board of visitors -of a school society should be required. to elect a chairman, who 
should be held responsible for the performance of the legal duties of the body. 
Third, the establishment of a State normal school for the professional instruction 
of teachers. 
These recommendations were adopted, and by the act of 1845 the commissioner 
of the State school fund was made the virtual superintendent of common 
schools, with duties similar to those of the late secretary, with the exception of 
the editorship of a State journal of education. It was the great good fortune of 
the State at this critical period to have another firm and able official friend of the 
common schools in Hon. Seth P. Beers, then commissioner of the State school 
fund. The Commonwealth always had reason to be proud of the admirable admin- 
istration of its generous school fund under Commissioner Hillhouse and his suc- 
cessor, who now became exofficio superintendent of public instruction. His first 
report, in 1846, is a modest official summary of the real situation and a moderate 
suggestion of the virtual reestablishment of the discarded system of 1837-1842, 
But the emphasis of the document was wisely concentrated upon a skillful mass- 
ing of such reports from the school visitors as told on the chief defects of the pres- 
ent system and the publication of an admirable prize essay by Rev. Noah Porter, 
afterwards president of Yale University, but then pastor of a church in Springfield, 
Mass. ‘The statistics of school attendance and all matters connected with popular 
education differ but little from those so thoroughly set forth by Henry Barnard 
eight years before. In 1845 not a town or school society in the State raised a tax 
for school purposes by voluntary taxation. Ina few cities some $9,000, 10 cents 
for each child, had been thus collected. In contrast with this record the shrewd 
commissioner sets forth the progress of the common school in Massachusetts, 
New York, Michigan, and the neighboring Rhode Island, where Henry Barnard 
had been called and was now ‘‘in the full tide of successful experiment” as super- 
intendent of the new common schools of the little State. In Connecticut ‘‘an 
apathy prevails like an atmosphere of death. People coming from other States to 
Connecticut feel like coming from the sunshine into a cellar.” All the usual 
agencies of reform agitation were invoked for the awakening of the people. 
The call was not unheeded. There was now in Connecticut a growing common- 
school public, the early fruitage of the seed so bountifully scattered by Henry 
Barnard and the original board of common-school commissioners, which responded 
to the appeal in behalf of the children. In 1846 a convention of 250 teachers and 
friends of the schools was held in Hartford, through four days, organized by Rev. 
Merrill Richardson, of Plymouth. The following report of Superintendent Beers 
speaks out with even clearer emphasis demanding a State board of education, the 
abolition of the school societies, and the resumption of the responsibility for the 
schools by the towns. It is also suggested that instead of resuming the publica- 
tion of the State School Journal, the leading newspapers of the State should be 
utilized and perhaps subsidized for the coming campaign of education; a sugges- 
tion so wise that it is strange it has not to a greater extent become the policy of 
every State. The people are reminded that while the initiation of several of the 
most valuable reforms in common-school affairs dates from Connecticut, Rev. 
T. H. Gallaudet, in 1825, having published a valuable pamphlet on normal 
schools, the school-teachers’ institute having been established first in Hartford in  
-P-A-G-E-864
  184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
1839, the school district library of Salisbury, Conn., being the first on record, and 
many of the most active leaders in popular education having been natives of Con- 
necticut, the State itself was suffering from the lack of the appreciation and 
application of its own highest ideals. 
During the year 1847 the two largest school institutes ever held in the State 
were attended by 1,400 teachers, a majority of the entire body; declared by Super- 
intendent Beers ‘‘the most important event in the history of the common schools 
for the last ten years.” He insists in keeping before the legislature the imperative 
need of a State superintendent of education; the duties of his own position mak- 
ing it impossible to do justice to the double office. In 1848 sixteen institutes were 
held. A treatise on school architecture of 400 pages, prepared for the people of 
Rhode Island by Superintendent Barnard, was published and sent to every school 
society in the State. Moderate progress was reported during these years when so 
much was done to hasten the return of Mr. Barnard and prepare for another four 
years of his administration. 
In 1849 the joint committee on education reported a bill appropriating $2,500 a 
year for four years to establish and support a Statenormal school. In the follow- 
ing year this school was founded at New Britain and Henry Barnard recalled from 
Rhode Istand, where he had established its first effective system of public instruc- 
tion, to the principalship of the State normal school and State superintendency of 
education in Connecticut. 
HENRY BARNARD IN RHODE ISLAND. 
It is unnecessary to repeat what has elsewhere been written concerning the state 
of public education in Rhode Island during the two hundred years previous to the 
invitation to Henry Barnard, in 1848, by the governor and legislature, to become 
the first general commissioner of common schools in the State. The fact can not 
be ignored that for two centuries after the establishment of the colony on Narra- 
gansett Bay, under the leadership of Roger Williams, there was no sustained effort 
to school the masses of the children by the colony or the State. Yet afair estimate 
of the circumstances will partially explain this failure to attempt what each 
of the remaining five New England settlements made haste to accomplish at the 
earliest period of its history. 
The little colony of Rhode Island, established in 1636, was practically a group 
of “come-outers ” from what they justly regarded the oppression of the dominant 
religious sect in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The first covenant of the Provi- 
dence settlers included the declaration that allegiance was due to the government 
of the majority only in civil affairs. The settlement was a valuable demonstra- 
tion in favor of absolute religious liberty at a time when such a protest was per- 
haps the most notable contribution that could be made to the rising civilization 
of the New World. 
But, like every great movement in behalf of individual freedom, this was clogged 
by the spirit of revolt against the whole idea of cooperation and compromise which 
is the absolute necessity of a prosperous state. The banner of absolute individual 
freedom there set up inevitably became the rallying point of every sort and condi- 
tion of person whofelt aggrieved in stateand church. Thenewcolony waslargely 
recruited from the Baptist and Quaker sects, a people distinguished as certainly 
by high personal ability and character as for their obstinate resistance to civil or 
ecclesiastical restraint. The strained relations with Massachusetts and Connecti- 
cut were a bar to any speedy adoption of the educational systems of both these 
colonies; in which the influence of the Congregational Church till a late period 
was very pronounced. Indeed, Rhode Island at first was rather a group of pri- 
vate corporations (‘‘proprietorships”) than a homogeneous colony. Sixty-five 
years after the first settlement it numbered but 10,000 people, the majority in  
-P-A-G-E-865

Providence, Newport, and two other settlements. In Providence and Newport 
and a few smaller towns arrangements for educational facilities were made at an 
early date, which for many years satisfied the more influential classes, private 
schools of different sorts and the beginnings of Brown University. 
In 1799 the Mechanics’ Association of Providence made a vigorous demonstra- 
tion in behalf of a system of public instruction for the State. Previous to this a 
movement, inaugurated under the lead of President Manning, of Brown Univer- 
sity, for a public school system for the city of Providence, had failed of public 
indorsement, chiefly because it proposed to subsidize the parochial school of the 
Friends. Under the energetic influence of Howland, with the cooperation of many 
of the most wealthy and distinguished people of the city, the legislature in 1799 was 
persuaded to enact a school law which for the time was perhaps the most enlight- 
ened of any in the Union. But it was weighted with two fatal defects, local 
option and the lack of a reliable superintending State official. Only the city of 
Providence availed itself of its provisions and founded the system of publicschools 
that has gone on without a serious drawback to the present day. But in 1803 
this statute was repealed by the votes of the remainder of the State. Henry Bar- 
nard declared that ‘‘had this original law been accepted through the State asin 
Providence, Rhode Island would have had the best school system in New Eng- 
land. Even had there been in the statute a provision by which a competent pub- 
liceofficial could have explained its provisions to the people, it probably would 
not have been repealed.” It was certainly free from the powerful ecclesiastical 
influence which indirectly in Massachusetts and more directly in Connecticut 
prevailed until well into the century. 
No further successful effort for popular education was made till 1827-28, when, 
as the result of an agitation through several years, a school law was finally 
passed which was practically the basis of the present system of public instruction 
in Rhode Island. This act provided that the State should appropriate $10,000 annu- 
ally from the avails of certain taxes and receipts divided among all the towns in pro- 
portion to their school population. It also conferred a limited authority on the 
towns to tax for the cost of instruction. Butit left the power to build schoolhouses 
and school supplies so indefinite that during the next dozen years the statute book 
was burdened with supplementary amendments, and special legislation was 
required even to enable a school district to build a schoolhouse. In 1836 the 
State set aside the United States deposit fund of more than $300,000 for the use of 
the public schools and afterwards provided for the establishment of district 
school libraries, and in 1839 legislated to protect children under 12 years of age 
working in the manufactories by securing to them three months of schooling a 
year. 
But the fatal lack of a central supervising authority left educational affairs still 
at loose ends. Every little town or school district assumed the prerogatives of a 
free and independent republic as far as concerned its arrangement for the educa- 
tion of thechildren. Nobody knew the actual condition of the schools, although 
the State had then but little more than 100,000 population and some 35,000 chil- 
dren of school.age. But in 1848 the public dissatisfaction at this condition of 
affairsculminated. Governor James Fenner had already declared himself a friend 
of educational reform, and emphasized his declaration by giving to the schools of 
his own city, Newport, the sum usually appropriated for the celebration of gov- 
ernor’s inauguration day. Strong petitions came up to the legislature. Mr. 
Wilkins Updike, an influential member, prepared a short bill designed to furnish 
the one thing needful to set in motion the present cumbrous educational machin- 
ery. Ina powerful speech supporting the bill, he declared that ‘‘ outside of Prov- 
idence and a few towns, the public school system was not a blessing to the State.” 
This speech takes high rank in the educational literature of the Commonwealth,

He freely exposed the unsatisfactory condition of the schools and deplored the 
fact that Rhode Island, a Commonwealth pledged by its entire history to magnify 
the personal liberty of the citizen, should be so unmindful of the fundamental 
personal right of the child to the educational training that makes for good citizen- 
ship. Rhode Island was then theseventh Commonwealth in the Union in the scale 
of intelligence, 1,600 adult persons of its population of 103,000 being absolutely 
illiterate, and the school facilities offered to the children in all respects open to 
the gravest objections. The best proof that Mr. Updike voiced the prevailing 
opinion of the progressive school public was the passage of this. bill and the invi- 
tation to Henry Barnard, just thrown out of office by the repeal of the school law 
of Connecticut of 1837, to visit the State, address the legislature, and generally 
advise concerning the proper enforcement of the statute. 
Dr. Barnard seems never to have been a man even of “literary leisure” during 
his long life of more than 80 years, 60 of which have been consecrated to the work 
of popular education. On the downfall of the system of schools in Connecticut, 
which practically he had organized and administered from 1837 to 1842, he had 
immediately resumed his travels through the United States, with the especial 
intention of collecting the materials for a history of the American common school. 
He was everywhere found carefully observing and wisely suggesting, and every- 
where welcomed by the most discerning and influential friends of education. His 
strong leaning to the literary side of the great revival of the common school had 
already been manifested in his establishment of the Connecticut Journal of Educa- 
tion, which he had made a storehouse of valuable information. But the governor 
of Rhode Island spoke the right word when he advised Mr. Barnard ‘‘that it was 
better to make history than to write it.” And nowhere in the history of popular 
education in the United States is there a more conspicuous example of making a 
new chapter in the history of education than in the labors through five crowded 
years of Henry Barnard, who accepted and held the office of the first State com- 
missioner of education for Rhode Island from 1848 to 1849. 
The Rhode Island school law of 1843 was mainly a provision for a State super- 
intendency of common schools. The first section requires the governor to “ appoint 
an agent,” whose salary shall be fixed by the legislature. The remaining clause 
was a declaration of his duties as usually defined in the few States that had 
already established the office. Mr. Barnard was appointed commissioner and 
assumed the duties of the position September 1, 1843. 
The immediate duty of the commissioner here, as in Connecticut, was to learn 
the actual condition of educational affairs. For two very busy years Commis- 
sioner Barnard worked at this point in his own characteristic, persistent, and 
minute style, represented by the daguerreotype, which, according to Hawthorne, 
most completely reveals the inner life of the subject. Certainly this inspection 
left on the mind of Mr. Barnard a complete picture of the educational state of 
Rhode Island, with a thorough insight into the cause of the present state of affairs. 
In this work of investigation he was favored by the fact that the school commis- 
sioner of Rhode Island had in certain ways a larger power than had been conferred 
by Massachusetts or Connecticut—the appointment of boards of county officials 
for the examination of teachers and the inspection of the schools. 
From 1843 to 1845, when Commissioner Barnard’s first written report appeared, 
he visited every town in the State, and in many cases repeated the visit, inspected 
209 schools, and put himself in personal connection with 400 teachers, besides a habit 
of constant intercourse with parents, friends of education, and even children and 
youth. One thousand circulars of the elaborate sort that made each a valuable 
treatise on education had been sent to the teachers and school officials. He was 
now prepared to tell the people of Rhode Island the facts of the situation in his 
own peculiar style, in which the most unwelcome truths are pressed home with 
the irresistible force of a skillful surgeon manipulating a dangerous wound, in a
-P-A-G-E-867
  HENRY BARNARD. 787 
spirit so appreciative and friendly that his entire career seems to have been free 
from the fierce personal collisions and violent controversies which finally wore 
out the life of his illustrious friend and colaborer, Horace Mann. 
But the bald facts of the case were sufficient to wake the most apathetic people 
to a sense of impending peril and were in themselves a loud call for reform. The 
school legislation of the State had become a bewildering maze, the original law of 
1828 having been so built upon and modified, with so much left to special enact- 
ment, that the system was almost unworkable. More than fifty supplementary 
acts had placed the original statute like a house located in the center of an ever- 
glade through which only an expert guide could find the way. The law wasa 
fair transcript of the state of public opinion in the little Commonwealth. Every- 
where private and personal opinion, masking under a lofty assertion of ‘‘inde- 
pendence,” ‘‘had full course to run and be glorified.”. The original Providence 
compact to obey the government of the majority ‘only in things civil” had been 
perverted so that education by the State was supposed to violate the religious lib- 
erty of the parent; a curious illustration of the way in which the narrowest reli- 
gious sectarianism may fraternize with the most radical assertion of civil and 
religious liberty; as the deadly rattlesnake and the harmless gopher of the West- 
ern prairies burrow in the same hole. So violent was this prejudice that respect- 
able members of the legislature declared that the attempt to tax a community for 
public schools ‘‘ would be resisted at the point of the bayonet.” 
The evil of local division into little school districts had practically made good 
school keeping in the open country an impossibility. The State was swarmed 
upon by discarded teachers from abroad, and there was no attempt at profes- 
sional training at home. The neglect of the examination of teachers, school visi- 
tation, and supervision was even an exaggerated copy of what the commissioner 
had encountered in Connecticut. The variety of schoolbooks on every topic was 
numbered by the hundred, and there was great neglect by many parents to fur- 
nish the children with books at all. In 1844 but three towns had imposed a tax 
for schools, In 1845, outside of Providence and a few smaller towns, there was not 
three months a year of school. One in every forty of the adult people of the 
State could not read or write. Mr. Barnard found only twelve female teachers in 
the State outside of Providence and a few towns. He asserted that two-thirds of 
the children could be taught better by women, and their employment at regula- 
tion wages would add two months to the winter school term. 
The condition of the schoolhouses was such as, by contrast, to make the present 
status of school accommodations “palatial.” In 1843-44 only 312 houses were 
provided for 405 schools, 147 of them being owned by “ proprietors ”—virtually 
private property. Of 280 examined, 25 ‘‘ were in good repair,” 62 ‘‘in ordinary 
repair,” 86 ‘‘ absolutely unfit for occupation,” 180 ‘‘on a line with a public road,” 
29 only with a playground, 200 had an interior height of only 8 feet, with no 
means of ventilation; the seats were generally arranged around three sides of the 
room, with no backs, and 14 to 18 inches above the floor; ‘‘ 270 had no clock, black- 
board, or thermometer, and only 5 possessed a scraper or mat for the feet.” 
In 1844 there were probably 35,000 children between the ages of 4 and 16 in the 
State; 24,000 were in all the schools—21,000 in public and 3,000 in private; only 
18,500 in regular attendance. Only 5,000 attended during the whole school year, 
6,000 not over threemonths. The school boys outnumbered the girls, above 18 
five, and above 10 years of age, four to one. Six thousand children had no regu- 
lar schooling. Mr. Barnard declared that four-fifths of the private schools would 
disappear if the public schools could be improved. Only 2,000 of the 35,000 chil- 
dren received nine months schooling in the year. 
In short, all the defects with which Mr. Barnard had struggled during his five 
years administration in Connecticut were found in an exaggerated state in Rhode 
Island. But the small area of territory, the concentration of population in a few
-P-A-G-E-868
  788 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
centers, the entire population of the State being less than the city of Providence 
to-day, and the whole number of children not exceeding that of a city of 200,000 
people, were favorable circumstances. Some of the most serious obstructions in 
Connecticut did not there exist. In Mr. John Kingsbury, principal of the famous 
Academy for Girls, in Providence, the commissioner found an able and indefat- 
igable assistant. In 1845 the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction was formed, 
which became a powerful agency for missionary work. For several years it 
maintained an ‘‘itinerating agency ” in the person of Mr. Baker, which amounted 
almost to a house-to-house visitation. The journal of the institute, edited and 
largely supported by Mr. Barnard, became the medium of publication for his 
reports and information concerning public education at home and abroad. 
In 1844 the legislature intrusted to Commissioner Barnard the preparation of a 
new school statute. The work included the codifying and rearranging the school 
legislation of the State. This law, after two years, was adopted, and by 1848 the 
school-ship was in full sail toward the haven of success. One valuable service to 
the people was an elaborate explanation of the new law, prepared by Mr. Barnard, 
published with it, and sent to every school district. In this law and commentary 
the defects of the schools received attention, and as far as possible were remedied. 
The result was that when Mr. Barnard was compelled, in 1849, to retire from 
his office by failing health, he could honestly report that Rhode Island possessed 
one of the best systems of public education in the Union. One hundred and 
twenty thousand dollars outside of Providence had been expended in building or 
repairing schoolhouses, and the commissioner’s valuable treatise on school archi- 
tecture was in the hands of every school committee. Every town in the State 
raised a tax to supplement the State fund, and the local levy amounted to $1 per 
capita. More than 1,100 meetings had been held and 1,500 addresses delivered, 
beside a perpetual discussion of educational topics. 
A large convention of school officials and eminent teachers had met, after nine 
months’ experience of the new law, to discuss its merits and suggest amendments; 
200 meetings of parents and teachers had been held; 16,000 educational pamphlets, 
each of 16 pages, had been gratuitously distributed, and 1,200 volumes bought by 
teachers for libraries. During one year every almanac published in Rhode Island 
had contained 16 additional pages on education, furnished by the commissioner. 
A school library of at least 500 volumes was found in 29 towns. 
The improvement in school buildings was pronounced ‘‘ a complete renovation, 
nay, a revolution,” the State in 1849 having the best average of schoolhouses in 
New England. ‘‘ Good teachers and improved school buildings had added 50 per 
cent to school attendance.” One hundred primary schools with women teachers 
had been established, and the graded system was organized in all the principal 
towns. No schoolhouse was without a blackboard and one-third of them had 
globes and maps. The best people in the State were serving on school committees, 
and the new school law imposed a fine for the refusal to serve after election. The 
towns had been granted an unlimited power of local taxation, a minimum rate 
being fixed as a condition of receiving the State distribution. In 1847 only three 
towns in Rhode Island refused to vote a tax for schools. The entire expenditure 
for public education was $58,000, more than one-half the entire expenses of goy- 
ernment for the State. The valuation of the State in 1844 was $59,000,000, the 
largest per capita in any State, $5.41; Massachusetts, $4.06; Connecticut, $3.25; 
New York, $2.49. 
But there was still a great work to be done in Rhode Island. The conditions, 
even after the great results achieved by Mr. Barnard’s administration of five 
years, were such as would not be regarded with a special favor in any State of 
‘the Union to-day. But the decisive battle had been fought and won. The people 
of Rhode Island had learned the great lesson of ‘cooperation for the public good, 
and the reign of unbridled personal and private opinions and obstinate willfulness

masquerading as the spirit of freedom had closed. It was mostremarkable. On 
the retirement in 1848 of the great commissioner, enforced by a collapse of health 
induced by his great exertions in behalf of the children of the State, the legis- 
lature unanimously enacted a vote of thanks, the teachers of the Commonwealth 
expressed their gratitude by a valuable present, and the portrait of Henry Barnard 
now hangs in an honorable place in one of the public buildings of Providence. 
THE COMMON SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT. 
But while Mr, Barnard was thus occupied with the creation of the first common- 
school system of Rhode Island his heart was still in his own State and city. One 
of the most important of the many good works accomplished in these early years 
of his prolonged ministry of education was the great influence and aid he con- 
tributed to the protracted effort to establish the Free High School of the city of 
Hartford, Conn. In a remarkable letter to Principal Capron of this school, 
written in 1871, he gives an elaborate history of the campaign of education through 
which this celebrated school fought its way to its final establishment, becoming as 
great a power for the free secondary education in Connecticut and other States as 
Yale in the realm of the higher education. As an object lesson in the history of 
multitudes of similar institutions in all parts of the country, and an encourage- 
ment for the persistent and intelligent pushing of a great public cause, this letter 
could be republished and read to-day, especially in our Southern States, with great 
benefit. A brief sketch of this episode in the busy life of Dr. Barnard should not 
be left out of this narrative. 
In the speech delivered by young Henry Barnard, as a member of the legislature 
of Connecticut in 1838, in support of his own bill for the reform of the depressed 
school system of the old Commonwealth, occurs a hearty tribute to the Boston 
Latin School, first and most celebrated of the class of free seminaries of the sec- 
ondary type that came up in connection with the original common-school moye- 
ment in the New England colonies. He tells the story, more striking then than 
to-day, that in this school a son of a President of the United States received the 
second prize, when the first honors were given to the son of the man who sawed 
the President's wood pile. Soon after his appointment to the office of secretary 
of the Connecticut State board of education, in an address before the Young Men’s 
Institute, or Lyceum, of Hartford. Mr. Barnard urged the young men to labor for 
the development of the higher city life, including a reference to the unsatisfac- 
tory condition of the public schools of Hartford. This lecture in substance was 
repeated in several of the larger towns of the Commonwealth, and is said to have 
been very influential in the movement that resulted in the establishment of high 
schools, public libraries, and similar institutions in the State. Among other sug- 
gestions was one that has commended itself to many of our chief American cities 
and smaller towns—a voluntary association of mothers to look after the sanitary 
arrangements and moral training of school children. In this admirable address 
he outlines the present system of agencies for the general welfare of our larger 
American communities with a prophetic foresight. It is suggestive of the state 
of public opinion in New England half a century ago that, even as late as 1888, an 
educator so progressive as Henry Barnard should have been obliged to advocate 
the schooling of the free colored children of Connecticut in separate schools. 
In 1842, on his retirement from the administration of the discarded system of 
education in Connecticut, Mr. Barnard prepared a document as an appendix to 
his final report urging the addition of the free high school to the present system. 
Although this was only a call for the restoration of a prominent feature of the 
original colonial common school, the free grammar school to be established in 
every town of 100 families, the legislature of Connecticut refused to pass it on the 
plea that it was inexpedient to support the secondary education by the State. At
-P-A-G-E-870

this juncture Mr. James Wadsworth, of New York, a native of Connecticut, 
already known for his munificent and influential support of the district school 
library system in his adopted State, caused to be printed and circulated at his own 
expense 30,000 copies of Mr. Barnard’s document, which was largely read and was 
very influential through the entire country. 
Previous to this, in 1839, at an educational convention held at Hartford, pre- 
sided over by Mr. Seth P. Beers and addressed by Prof. Calvin Stowe, Alexander 
Everett, and George B. Emerson, the subject of the grading of city and village 
schools was thoroughly discussed at several sessions, every city of the State being 
represented. Mr. Barnard there urged the establishment of union schools. Pro- 
fessor Stowe then asserted that the public schools of Cincinnati, Ohio, were among 
the best in the country. It was shown that five-sixths of the nonattendance on 
the common school was in the cities and larger towns, probably from the fact 
that these were the manufacturing centers of the State and the well-to-do families 
educated their children in private schools. It was suggested that private associa- 
tions might well be formed to agitate for and, if necessary, to afford material aid 
to this enterprise. This was effectually done a few years later, at New Britain, 
Conn., in the establishment there of a State normal school. An association of 
this sort was formed at once at Hartford; at first of five members, two more than 
the attendance at the last annual meeting of the Central School Society of that 
city. 
The agitation thus begun did not pause till six years later it resulted in the 
establishment of the Free High School for Hartford for boys and girls, with the 
old Hopkins School of the city included as its classical department. The long and 
obstinate conflict that terminated in this victory for the people was one of the 
most influential in the history of American education. The staid old capital of 
10,000 people was shaken to its rock-ribbed foundations. Dr, Horace Bushnell, 
the splendid man of all work for Connecticut, as the foremost theologian of Amer- 
ica, in 1842 contributed an important service in his scathing exposure of the 
condition of the public schools of the city, and his energetic appeal led to a reor- 
ganization of the central school society, out of which, in 1847, came the present 
high school. Before that time, in 1839, Mr. Barnard began the publication of his 
Connecticut Common School Journal, without a subscriber or a dollar of income, 
and supported it chiefly by his own money, 
In 1842 the cause of popular education gained a new and powerful adyocate in 
Mr. James N. Bunce, a gentleman of large wealth and public spirit in Hartford. 
He had attended an educational convention in 1845, where, before a meager audi- 
ence, the most important matters had been ably discussed, and declared that ‘‘ this 
should not happen again if he could help it.” Another convention, more largely 
attended, was held in 1846. Mr. Bunce wrote to Henry Barnard, then in Rhode 
Island, to ‘come out of the wilderness and help your own brethren and State,” 
promising his own personal cooperation and material aid. Mr. Barnard in reply 
suggested that he was just then too much occupied in ‘‘ making the wilderness 
blossom as the rose” to accept the call. But he at once took the matter to heart, 
proposed a campaign of agitation, and for the five subsequent years was the soul 
of the movement. 
At his suggestion Mr. Bunce offered a prize for an essay on popular education, 
which brought forth the remarkable paper by Rev. Noah Porter, afterwards pres- 
ident of Yale, which is still a classic in American educational literature. Mr. 
Barnard made a statement which the teachers and educators of the country would. 
even to-day do wisely to heed: ‘‘I have never seen a gathering of parents of any 
class who could not be interested in the subject of schools and education if pre- 
sented in a practical way, and especially in reference to their own children and 
schools.” Thus through a five-years’ campaign, not inferior in spirit and exciting 
incident to a great political election, the people of Hartford, as far as concerned 
 
-P-A-G-E-871
  HENRY BARNARD. Gt 
the voters of the central school society, were at last educated to the point that, 
after repeated meetings and months of public discussion, the vote was carried by 
an overwhelming majority for a free high school. Mr. Bunce contributed $1,000 
toward the expense and pledged $5,000 toward a State normal school. Twelve 
thousand dollars was invested in the enterprise and the Hopkins grammar school ~ 
fund provided for the classical department. A tax for 1} cents on the dollar was 
laid on the property of the members of the society for its maintenance. It atonce 
became one of the best of this class of seminaries in the country. Mr. Barnard 
visited Hartford five times in connection with it, engineered the campaign, out- 
lined the plans of the building, drew up the course of study, and was, in fact, 
almost omniscient in the good work. 
On December, 1847, he was called to the grateful task of assisting at the dedica- 
tion of the new high school at Hartford. In his address, which also covered every 
superior interest of the metropolitan life of the country, he made the remarkable 
declaration: ‘‘I say deliberately, for the whole country, that if the efforts which 
haye been put forth here, and which the deep conviction of the same necessity has 
caused to be put forth in other States, fail to incorporate this high school feature 
into our system of common schools, that the higher education—everything beyond 
the merest rudiments, will pass into the inevitable keeping of religious bodies 
and adventure schools, over which the people can exercise no control, and parents 
can have no guaranty of the value of the education their children will receive, 
There can not be—there never has been—an efficient system of primary instruc- 
tion, whose teachers and officers were not supplied from public institutions of a 
higher grade.” 
On this occasion Dr. Horace Bushnell also delivered one of those remarkable 
addresses which so often during his prolonged career set the most thoughtful people 
of the entire Republic thinking along new lines of observation. The occasion was 
one long to be remembered. It is not too much to say that the establishment of 
the Hartford free high school marked a new era in the development of public sec- 
ondary education in the country. It was the most signal victory yet achieved in 
the conflict everywhere inaugurated between the people and the religious sects and 
more favored classes for the control of this important department of education. 
This school at once became a conspicuous center of the secondary education for 
the whole State, and thirty years later remained a great academy to which pupils 
were sent from all portions of the country. 
Its establishment was also the stimulant to a similar movement in other cities 
of the Commonwealth. A few years later Dr. Barnard was called, as one of a 
distinguished group of college presidents, professors, and public men, to dedicate 
the free academy at Norwich, Conn., whose reputation has only been less than 
the Hartford High School, and whose outcome has been the elevation of this and 
many of the smaller New England cities to national reputation as centers of 
educational and philanthropic activity. Norwich is now everywhere known in 
connection with the schooling of the colored youth of the South in normal and 
industrial training, by the gift of the Slater fund of $1,000,000. Connecticut from 
that time, even beyond its previous reputation, became a great hive, sending forth 
every year new swarms of enthusiastic workers in the secondary and higher edu- 
cation, especially through the West and the South. The influence of Barnard, 
Capron, Gallaudet, Porter, Bunce, Bushnell, and Beers was felt at once even to 
the summit of the great mountain divide, and later through our new Pacific 
empire. 
In his letter to Principal Capron, Mr. Barnard, in 1871, wrote this triumphant 
declaration: ‘‘I have seen every provision drafted by me, which was stricken out 
of the statute books of Connecticut in 1842, restored, and many more remembered 
by me not only placed in the school laws, but also become a part of the school 
habits of the people. And more than this, I have lived long enough to see nearly

all the condemned features of city and town organization advocated in Hartford 
from 1838 to 1842 and denounced as the ‘impracticable schemes of an enthusiast’ 
ingrafted into the constitutions of 15 States and the school systems of 35 States 
and upward of 100 cities of over 40,000 inhabitants and many more with a smaller 
population.” What a supplement could this venerable apostle of the people’s 
school write to this declaration now, twenty-five years later, when he beholds the 
majestic spectacle of our 16 Southern Commonwealths united in the support of 
every department of the people’s common school, with a dozen new and powerful 
States and Territories beyond the great mountains and along the Pacific Coast. 
each in some good way surpassing its predecessors in the glorious work of train- 
ing its children and youth for the coming citizenship of the new Republic. 
But even in this letter to Principal Capron, Dr. Barnard notes the fact that 
Hartford, as late as 1871, still held with a firm grasp to the antiquated local dis- 
trict organization of the common school. Half the children in the city, according 
to his statement, were not then found in it, And later than this, the original 
system of separate district organization was persisted in after it had disappeared 
from almost every other city of similar importance in the Union. The educators 
of our new States, who rejoice in the organization and growth of their splendid 
systems of public instruction, can with difficulty realize through what a long and 
wearisome period of toil, conflict, and sacrifice the great apostles of the children 
and youth wrought through the generation of the common-school revival, from 
1830 to the opening of the civil war, to save this, the nation’ 's most precious her- 
itage, for its future perpetuity and glory. 
HENRY BARNARD AS STATE SUPERINTENDENT IN CONNECTICUT. 
On the ist of August, 1851, Henry Barnard was recalled to his former position, 
now fitly named superintendent of the common schools in Connecticut, and at 
once entered on the duties of a second term of four years. It will be unnecessary 
here to enlarge on the performance of the ordinary official labors of the new super- 
intendent during this period. The actual condition of the public schools of the 
State was not greatly in advance of what has already been set forth in 1842; 
indeed, it is possible that in some localities they had suffered from the repeal of 
the law of 1838. But in several important conditions of success there had been a 
marked improvement. The spectacle of a great political party using the tempo- 
rary disaffection of the people concerning popular education to elevate itself to 
power is always a warning to an American Commonwealth. In this case the 
warning seems to have punctuated a crisis in the common-school policy of Con- 
necticut. 
At once the friends of the educational revival and reform came together as a 
proper educational public, which, by 1844, made itself felt at the statehouse and 
in the administrative affairs of the Commonwealth. It can not be denied that the 
marvelous intellectual fertility of Henry Barnard, as the foremost American lite- 
rary exponent of the great revival of popular education, was somewhat in the way 
of immediate practical results in reforming abuses and inaugurating radical 
changes in the schools. His successor, Mr. 8. P. Beers, brought to his difficult 
position the rare executive ability which had characterized his administration of 
the State school fund, and, through his cautious and persistent handling of the 
legislature and wise direction of public opinion, one of the most essential features 
of Dr. Barnard’s policy, the establishment of a State normal school, had been 
already brought to a happy conclusion. 
The establishment of the first teachers’ institute in Hartford, in 1839, during the 
administration of Secretary Barnard, was followed by a vigorous working of that 
important agency. Every year during the administration of Mr. Beers this popu- 
lar movement had gained strength, until it secured the favor of the teaching body 
 
-P-A-G-E-873
  _ HENRY BARNARD. 793 
and impressed the thoughtful class of the people with the idea of a permanent 
arrangement for normal instruction. For thirty years the more progressive lead- 
ers of public education in Connecticut had been laboring at this problem. In 1816 
Mr. Denison Olmstead, then principal of the Union School at New London, had 
published an important pamphlet on ‘‘ An academy for teachers” and reenforced 
its arguments in a striking address at Yale College. Prof. J. L. Kingsley, of 
Yale, in 1823, through a forcible article in the North American Review, had dis- 
cussed the same proposition. Dr. William Russell, principal of the New Town- 
ship Academy at New Haven, had given his influential name to the agitation. In 
1825 Rey. T. H. Gallaudet, already with a national reputation as the leader of 
the important department of the education of the deaf and dumb in the United 
States, wrote a series of able articles on normal school instruction, which was 
republished and widely read. Dr. Barnard declares it the crowning service of Dr. 
Gallaudet to the cause of American education, that not only in his own specialty 
but in the general application to all schools he so ably and distinctly set forth the 
necessity of special professional training as a prime condition of success in the 
fundamental profession of instruction. We have seen that Dr. Barnard, in his 
notable legislative speech before the general assembly, which carried the original 
reform-school law of Connecticut in 1838, declared that a special provision for the 
training of teachers was a vital part of his proposed reform in the common schools 
of the State. He vigorously followed up this proposition in all his reports as 
secretary of the State board of education. In 1839 he carried a bill to appropriate 
$5,000 for the general work of training teachers, not necessarily for a State normal 
school, through the lower branch of the legislature, only to see it practically shelved 
by a committee of the senate. His repeated attempts to push the subject, in 1841, 
met the same fate. In 1842 the work was arrested and his office abolished by the 
repeal of the law of 1838. 
But the good seed thus sown during a generation had fallen on good ground and 
sprung up. The teachers’ institute was the form in which both the school men 
and the public now welcomed the movement. Many prominent educators from 
other States and men of large public reputation at home were brought before the 
great audiences that thronged these gatherings. 
In 1844 a committee of eight was appointed to investigate the condition of the 
public schools. This committee, at the session of 1845, made a report including 
the recommendation for a State normal school. In 1846 (8. P. Beers, secretary) 
the legislative joint committee on education reported a bill appropriating $2,500 a 
year for four years to establish a training school for teachers, with a committeo 
of eight, one from each county of the State, to locate and establish it. ‘The propo- 
sition was warmly debated and the bill passed unanimously in the house, but was 
lost in the senate by one vote. But in 1848 the bill finally became alaw. After 
a ten-years battering at the ‘‘ knocker on the big front door” the ‘‘land of steady 
habits” admitted the State Normal School for teachers. The people of New 
Britain, a pleasant town a few miles from Hartford, at once formed an ‘“ educa- 
cational fund association,” with a capital of $25,000, in shares of $25, to locate the 
new normal school. 
On June 4, 1851, the State of Connecticut joined the procession, third in the line, 
with Massachusetts and New York ahead, in dedicating the new normal school 
buildings at New Britain. The people of that town had erected school buildings 
at the expense of $16,000, and placed their own schools with several hundred 
pupils under the supervision of the normal as a school of observation and prac- 
tice. Henry Barnard lately retired from his arduous and brilliant career of super- 
vision in Rhode Island, was now brought back to his native State and city in the 
double office of ‘‘superintendent of public education” and ‘principal of the State 
Normal School.” He accepted on the condition that a competent assistant should 
have the special charge of the normal school, and Rey. T. P. D. Stone, from
-P-A-G-E-874

Massachusetts, was called, with the aid of Professor Guion and several assistant 
women teachers, to this post. Two of the early teachers of this first normal 
school in Connecticut, Dr. Philbrick and Mr. 8. D. Camp, afterwards became the 
successors of Dr. Barnard in the State superintendency. 
On a midsummer day, June 4, 1851, the governor, State officials, legislature, and 
a goodly show of the foremost citizens of the State, with an imposing military 
demonstration marched to the railroad station at Hartford and were received at 
New Britain with added ceremony by the enthusiastic people of the enterprising 
little New England town for a whole day’s and evening’s celebration of the open- 
ing of the State Normal School. In his address, Superintendent Barnard again 
took up the theme on which, for the past sixty years, he has told his ‘‘story with- 
out an end,” of education as the glory of the Republic. After a mighty feast of 
Connecticut roast turkey, mince and apple pies, the great crowd surged back to 
“‘pusiness” and listened for another hour and a half of a summer’s night to one of 
the electric discourses of Dr. Horace Bushnell, for a generation the theological 
and spiritual dynamo of New England, on ‘‘ Connecticut.” Theschool had already 
been opened with 35 pupils, and 300 applied during the first year. For two years 
the State Normal was little more than a permanent normal institute, receiving 
teachers and pupils of all grades for even less than one term, with personal courses 
of study. Its sessions were adjusted to the convenience of the terms of the sum- 
mer and winter district schools. But the organizers of the New State Normal with 
wise discretion had planted it amid the environment of a large practice school, 
containing the entire school population of a considerable town, officered by expe- 
rienced teachers, and the observation and practice in a good graded school was of 
inestimable benefit, even to the crudest young schoolmaster who came up for 
three months to New Britain, as to an educational Mecca, for aid and comfort. 
But in the third year the legislature voted a permanent annual appropriation of 
$4,000, and a systematic course of instruction was set up at the center of the 
drifting crowd of students. In 1860 State Superintendent Camp reported gratify- 
ing progress. Already, in less than ten years, 1,500 teachers had come under the 
influence of the State Normal School from 130 towns, 500 of whom were then in 
service, at least one from every school society. Dr. Barnard was unable, from 
his arduous duties of State superintendency, to secure time for instruction in the 
school, or even do much for the institutes, although his fatherly eye was here as 
everywhere upon the children and youth of his beloved State. 
Another most important service rendered to the Commonwealth by Superin- 
tendent Barnard was the drawing up of a revised code of school legislation, which 
included all the reforms he had originally advocated. After a sort of informal 
“referendum” to the teachers and people and a thorough discussion in the legis- 
lature it was enacted in 1849. It aimed, in general, at a consolidation and simpli- 
fying of theentire organization and administration of public schoolaffairs. Asfar 
as was then possible it attempted to restore the management of the common 
school to the control of the towns, the reduction of the too numerous school offi- 
cials, the more equitable distribution of the State school funds, the encourage- 
ment of local taxation and especially the inauguration of the graded system 
whereby the inevitable confusion of the oldtime district school of New England 
was brought into order by the classification of pupils according to their attain- 
ments, and the building up of the present scheme of instruction from the primary 
to the high school adopted. 
Under the overloaded system then in operation, according to Superintendent 
Barnard, “ each of 1,650 school districts was independent of all others and practically 
acknowledged but a loose dependence on either the school, society, or the State.” 
Not less than 10,000 school officials, 2,000 of them, according to the same authority, . 
absolutely incompetent, and the majority indifferent to or neglectful of their legal 
obligations, were muddling the education of 75,000 children. Here, as in Rhode
-P-A-G-E-875

Island, was the real laboring oar of the educational craft, to break up the obstinate 
Puritan conceit of local independence in public affairs under which the most 
important concern of the State was practically falling into the hands of little 
rings of officeholders, even elected frequently byless than a quorum of the society 
meeting. 
But another service was not less important to the general educational welfare 
of the State and nation—the preparation by Superintendent Barnard of ‘‘The 
History of the Legislation of Connecticut Respecting Common Schools up to 
1838.” In place of an ordinary report for 1854, the superintendent furnished a 
stout volume of 180 pages of closely printed matter, not merely a dry record of 
legislation, but an elaborate and eloquent history of popular education in the 
State that, up to a recent time, had been in several important respects the most 
complete object lesson of the American common school in the Republic. Along 
with this were printed several valuable supplements and a useful sketch of edu- 
cational affairs in all the States which at this time had made any considerable 
progress in the common schooi—New England, New York,and Ohio. This docu- 
ment, with the reports of Horace Mann and Henry Barnard, was the real begin- 
ning of the educational literature of the common school in our country. It was 
followed by a long procession of similar documents, State and national, in all 
parts of the Union. Outcf this has come a body of common school practical 
literature for the uses of a republican State more valuable than that of any other 
country or period, where all that has come to us from abroad has been considered 
and its adaptation to local and general needs for the training of good American 
citizenship retained. Out of it came up, in 1865, the National Bureau of Edu- 
cation, now in practical efficiency the undisputed head of similar departments of 
education. Along with this, Superintendent Barnard had published and con- 
tributed, somewhat from legislative grants, but to a great extent at his own 
expense, many thousand copies of important documents concerning education 
abroad, schoolhouse architecture and arrangement, normal schools, and improved. 
methods of instruction which, often republished, had revealed him moreand more 
to the whole country. 
All this is but an inadequate view of the vast upland region of the twelve years 
of school administration and authorship which declared Henry Barnard the 
nation’s man of all work in the cause of the children. As usual, in all similar 
undertakings, he was again prostrated by shattered health and retired from the 
position of superintendency in 1855. His successor, Dr. John C. Philbrick, was 
called from the principalship of the State normal school to the position. In the 
opening sentences of his first report, 1855, he speaks of his predecessor in these elo- 
quent words: ‘‘I can not forget that I occupy the place that has been filled by one 
whose eminent abilities, wise counsels, and abundant labors in the cause of popu- 
lar education have merited and secured the highest respect and confidence of the 
people of the State. He embarked in this enterprise of superintendence when 
there were few to encourage and aid and many to discourage and oppose. He had 
peculiar work to do. He had to encounter the jealousies of party, the prejudices 
of ignorance, and the hostility of.a blind though honest conservatism, which could 
see nothing in his plans of improvement but destruction to the old landmarks of 
the fathers. In retiring he leaves a different state of things. He has enjoyed 
the satisfaction of witnessing these obstacles gradually melt away before the 
power of truth and the friends of progress constantly increase in number and 
power, until his long-cherished hope of seeing Connecticut regain her ancient 
place in the first rank of the educational States seems about to be realized and 
that blessed day is ushered in when every school in the State should be good 
enough for the best and cheap enough for the poorest.” : 
But the old State of Connecticut still went on, in Yankee parlance, ‘‘ at her own 
jog,” through all this tempest of literary and executive activity for the better educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-876

tion of the Commonwealth. In 1852, fourteen-years after the revival of 1888, Super- 
intendent Barnard reports the condition of public education as follows: There 
were 148 towns and 6 cities in 8 counties. Population of State, in round num- 
bers, 375,000, with a property valuation of $170,805,000; 95,000 children of school 
age (4 to 16); 217 school societies; 1,652 districts; State school fund, $2,050,000, 
with an income of $133,000, $1.40 for each child; town deposit (United States) fund, 
$763,600, with income for use of schools, $30,000; society and local funds,$100,000, 
with $6,000 income; tax in these societies, $4,000, and in 17 districts, $10,000; income 
from rate bills, $20,000, and from fuel tax, $10,000; in round numbers, $200,000 for 
cost of schools; 1,500 districts had winter and 1,400 summer schools in session from 
sixteen to forty-four weeks in the year; 75,000 children were enrolled, with an 
average attendance of 52,000; 8,400 pup:ls were found in 410 private schools, at a 
cost of $164,000; nearly three-fourths the sum expended for the 8,400 pupils in 
private as for the 75,000 children in common schools. More than 1,700 teachers 
received, for men $18.50 and for women $8.22 per month. Only 270 of these taught 
the same school in summer and winter, and 570 were teaching with no previous 
experience. Sixty schools had been ‘‘broken up ” during the year from incom- 
pentency of teachers. Nearly one-half the teachers were ‘‘boarding round.” Of 
the schoolhouses, 240 were reported “‘ very good,” 460 ‘‘ very poor,” more than one- 
third without sanitary arrangements for common decency. The reports of the 
county inspectors, appointed by the’superintendent, are full of complaints of “‘ pop- 
ular apathy.” A notable Fast Day sermon, by Rev. Mr. Goodrich, of Bristol, con- 
centrated these defects of the system in a powerful and earnest appeal to the 
people, which was republished as a portion of the report of Secretary Barnard. 
But much had really been done: A true educational public had been aroused; 
a body of efficient supervisors and educational workers had appeared, evolved by 
“natural selection” from the teachers and writers who were often better known 
and more influential outside the State than at home; a majority of the teachers 
were being gathered into the annual institutes and the State normal school; a 
State and several local associations were waking up the people at their numer- 
ously attended meetings addressed by the ablest school men from abroad and at 
home; an improved code of school laws had been spread on the statute books and 
the way at least opened for the proper consolidation and simplifying of the school 
life of the Commonwealth. And more than ever the fame of the great educators of 
Connecticut had been spread abroad and often with a better reception than at 
home were they received and put into active school life, especially in the new and 
growing States of the West. Meanwhile, New York, so largely dependent on 
Connecticut for the early establishment of her common schools, was now so far 
advanced that both Horace Mann and Henry Barnard magnified the Empire State 
as the foremost educational Commonwealth in the world. 
Among the eminent men in Connecticut to whom Henry Barnard was greatly 
indebted, not only for constant aid and comfort during his eventful career of 
superintendency in his native State and Rhode Island, from 1838 to 1855, but for 
perpetual suggestions in his philosophical and practical ideals of education, was 
Rey. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. But, far beyond his great contributions to his 
own State, was the influence of Mr. Gallaudet felt through the whole country; 
directly as the leader in the education of the deaf and dumband indirectly for the 
reformation of the methods of primary, mental, and moral instruction by his 
grasp on fundamental principles and scientific methods thereby obtained. A 
This admirable man came into the world with a furnishing of heredity that 
was in itself an assurance of greatness. He was of a good Huguenot French 
strain, blended with a descent from Italy running up to a superior class of. Vene- 
tian ancestors, reenforced by a vigorous Scottish and the best of Puritan blood. 
Thus furnished, he seemed destined from his cradle to that finest blending of 
Christian fervor, physical sensibility, pedagogic aptitude, and invincible will that
-P-A-G-E-877
  HENRY BARNARD. 797 
was the inspiration of all he did and of much that from the hindrance of delicate 
health he could not achieve during his crowded life of 63 years. 
_His father, after a varied life in Philadelphia, New York, and Hartford, was 
drifted into Government employment at Washington, where his grandson now 
presides over the National Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and there died at an 
advanced age. Among other good things, he established in his eightieth year, in 
1835, ‘the Washington Manual Labor School” and ‘‘ Male Orphan Asylum.” Its 
expenses were heartily met by the unique work, ‘‘the facsimile of George Wash- 
ington’s public accounts while commander of the armies of the thirteen colonies 
during the Revolutionary war.” The institution was afterwards merged with 
the Deaf and Dumb Asylum before mentioned. 
Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was born in Philadelphia in 1787, the oldest of a 
family of twelve children. He was fitted for College at Hartford, Conn., and 
entered Yale as sophomore at the age of 15, graduating in 1805 with high honors; 
President Heman Humphrey, of Amherst College, and Dr. Gardiner Spring, after- 
wards of New York, being his associates in class distinction. Yale was then 
under the presidency of Dr. Timothy Dwight, with Professors Day, Silliman, and 
Moses Stewart in the chairs of instruction. Like Barnard, he entered on the 
study of the law, but after a year was compelled by failing health to seek an out- 
door life. As the ‘‘traveling man” of a New York commercial house he visited 
large portions of the West and Southwest, and afterwards was connected with 
the firm ina New York counting room. From this occupation he was drawn by 
his strong leaning to the life of a clergyman and entered Andover Theological 
Seminary, from which he graduated in 1814. Declining several flattering offers 
for a permanent settlement in the ministry, he returned in 1814-15 to Hartford. 
Here, at the age of 28, he was found awaiting the providential call of his life. 
A little deaf and dumb daughter of Dr. Mason F. Cogswell, a distinguished phy- 
sician of Hartford, was ‘the little child that led” young Gallaudet to the strangely 
neglected but wide and rich domain of education in which he won a national 
fame and achieved abundant success. In the attempt to teach little Alice, his 
attention was directed to the reputation ofthe three English schools of this sort, 
and especially the writings of the famous Abbé Sicard, of Paris. Up to the year 
1800 there was no knowledge of such a department of education, and in 1815 but 
one small school of the kind in America. His success with his little pupil woke 
up a lively interest, and an association of leading gentlemen furnished the mod- 
erate means for a short visit abroad of observation and instruction. 
In the summer of 1815, Gallaudet, a Connecticut young man in pursuit of infor- 
mation on a great subject, appeared at the front door of the Institution for the 
Deaf and Dumb in London asking for admittance. But, with the true spirit of 
British isolation and exclusiveness of that period, the training of the deaf and 
dumb was a private monopoly, and he could not obtain the privilege of admittance, 
much less of instruction, except under conditions so humiliating that to receive it 
would bea positive degradation. Failing in the same way in Edinburgh, after mak- 
ing several valuable acquaintances, like Dr. Chalmers and Dougal Stewart, he 
went to Paris, where he was welcomed at the institution of the Abbé Sicard. 
After several months of close study he returned to Hartford, accompanied by Mr. 
Laurent Clerc, an experienced deaf and dumb instructor, who during the remain- 
der of his long life was the soul of the new institution which he entered in 1817 as 
assistant, though really the instructor of Mr. Gallaudet. During his residence 
in Paris he preached in an English church, and his discourses,’ afterwards pub- 
lished, showed that in the profession for which he had been educated he would 
have become one of the lights of the American pulpit. Beside a small establish- 
‘ment in Virginia, there was at this time no institution of the kind in the country. 
Through the influence of a group of the best-known men in Hartford, a subsidy 
of $5,000 was obtained from the Connecticut State legislature, and afterwards
-P-A-G-E-878
  798 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
$17,000 gathered by the exertions of Mr. Gallaudet in several cities. In 1817 he 
entered upon his notable career of fourteen years as principal and teacher in the 
Hartford Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, Through his own appearance before 
the Congress of the United States an appropriation was made of a grant of 23,000 
acres of public land, from which was realized a permanent endowment of $300,000 
for the institution. It was dedicated with the usual solemn public ceremonies by 
which New England always loves to inaugurate a good work of education, philan- 
thropy, or religion on May 22, 1821. 
The first pupil was Alice Cogswell, and the fifteenth Julia Fowler, whom Mr. 
Gallaudet married in 1821. She lived fifty-six years and proved herself a true 
helper in all the relations of his home and public life. It was soon discovered that 
the new principal was, in the words of his son, ‘‘a born teacher, and a teacher of 
teachers as well as of children.” He made a wonderful success in the develop- 
ment of the language of signs to which he was devoted. Like other specialists, 
perhaps he did not quite distinguish the fact that his own success in this was insep- 
arable from his personal genius rather than from its general use and practica- 
bility. It is said that at the request of the famous Connecticut painter, Col. John 
Trumbull, the story of the condemnation to death by Brutus of his two sons was 
entirely communicated by facial signs so correctly that a pupil wrote it all out. 
His biographer finds in this a trace of his descent from an Italian ancestry. 
But, as so often happens, this man of commanding genius, at once known and 
acknowledged through the Republic by his labors in several States as the founder 
of similar institutions, was compelled to live the life of a pedagogic drudge at 
home. At the end of achronic state of friction with his board of directors concern- 
ing details of administration he felt compelled to retire from the institution, after 
fourteen years of a service that, despite his habit of self-sacrifice, rendered him a 
perpetual subordinate. But, as a member of the corporation, his advice and aid 
were always at the service of the institution. His policy of administration was 
finally adopted, and in later years, at a great gathering of 400 graduates and 
pupils of similar asylums, a remarkable memorial service was held with the usual 
gift of professional silver. To-day his monument, built by the contribution of 
pupils and graduates of asylums, stands in the grounds of the original institution 
at Hartford, and a similar memorial may be seen at the national asylum at Wash- 
ington, which was established largely by his influence and is now presided over 
by his son. 
But this was not the only instance where a man of commanding genius has been 
“retired” upstairs by an unappreciative community into a broader sphere of his 
life work. In 1830, at the age of 43, Rev. T. H. Gallaudet was without question 
the foremost man in his own specialty in the United States. But for the twenty 
remaining years of his life he stood before the whole country as one of the broad- 
est, most original, and practical of American educators, in the best sense of the 
term. Declining repeated invitations to almost every conceivable .position of 
honor and profit in education, philanthropy, and the Christian ministry, he gave 
himself for eight years to the work of educational authorship. He had already 
become known by his numerous contributions to the coming educational revival, 
especially by a series of letters on the normal training of teachers in 1825, and 
other writings in support of common schools. His profound studies in child- 
nature applied in the training of the deaf and dumb had brought him into the very 
arcana of the philosophy of the natural methods of instruction, now a recognized 
authority in all schools, and his contributions to this most attractive realm of 
pedagogics were perhaps more valuable than those of any American educator of 
that period. The children of to-day, whose most exciting mental occupation is 
dodging the hailstorm of juvenile literature, do not realize that seventy years 
ago there was practically no children’s library of native authorship save the 
delightful publications of Peter Parley (S. G. Goodrich), also a Connecticut 
man. We remember well how eagerly we feil upon Mr. Gallaudet’s charming 
 
-P-A-G-E-879
  HENRY BARNARD. 799 
little ‘‘Child’s Book of the Soul,” and the series of scripture biographies and 
writings for the home, school, and church which during these years came from 
his pen as from an overflowing fountain of wisdom and love. . The American 
Tract Society alone printed and circulated 600,000 copies of these admirable pub- 
lications, and they were translated into all the leading European languages and 
read by thousands of old and young around the world. Among his writings of 
great educational value was the widely read essay, ‘‘ Public Schools a Public 
Blessing.” 
But, like many other distinguished friends of the common school, he never found 
one where he would educate his own five children, all of whom were trained in a 
model school in his own house, with a few companions, where he had them in con- 
stant oversight. His services as lecturer and official in public and private semi- 
naries, with constant calls to the pulpit and annual addresses, were a profession 
in themselves. He spent several months in a laborious visit through the West 
and Southwest, on an evangelical mission among the German people of those 
States. He was the president of the Hartford Missionary Association, and all his 
life greatly interested in the work of the Colonization Society for the Free Negroes, 
one of the benevolent dreams of that far-off time. During the last years of his 
life he served as the chaplain of the Retreat for the Insane at Hartford and dis- 
played wonderful aptitude in reaching and controlling the unfortunate inmates of 
this asylum. In 1838, at the age of 49, he was urged to accept the office of secre- 
tary of the new Connecticut State board of education, Henry Barnard, then in the 
legislature, offering to assist in making up a salary sufficient for his support. 
Earlier than this he was the first choice for the presidency of the first State nor- 
mal school established in the country, at Lexington, Mass. 
But in the delicate state of health in which he remained for the last twenty 
years of his life, he was doubtless wise in his avoidance of professional or public 
position. Thereby he became a sort of universal father and adviser of all the 
prominent educators of the land, and, more than any one man, was sought out 
and held in wide esteem as an authority in pedagogics and the wisest friend of 
the teachers and children. He was always a devout believer in the substance of 
the old-time Evangelical religious creed, as modified by the enlarged interpreta- 
tion of men of great spiritual genius, like Dr. Horace Bushnell, and always a 
preacher of the religion of everyday living. His moral scruples even extended to 
the avoiding of political action, and his only vote was cast, at the age of 61, for 
President of the United States. ‘‘He was the best beloved of all men; a true son 
of the light.” As the director for the Hartford Retreat for the Insane wrote, 
«When he died, sunshine went out of the house.” In the language of another, 
“He possessed the rare genius in pedagogy in making even children themselves 
feel that education is a priceless thing.” 
Dr. Gallaudet died in 1850, worn out with labors that might task the energies 
of many streng men, at the age of 63,in Hartford. But he had lived long enough, 
like his great friend, Dr. Barnard, to seeall that he had projected, and more than 
he had ever dared to hope, become the common possession of the whole country, 
both in his specialty of the training of the deaf and dumb and, generally, in the 
eminent success of that revival of popular education of which he was one of the 
chief apostles. 
He received collegiate honors from an institution of learning in a State that was 
a wilderness when he was born—the Ohio Western Reserve College; and his final 
home in Hartford was made possible by an appropriation of money from the board 
of directors of the institution from which he had found it greatly for his comfort 
to retire twenty years before. It is from such men and women, as from deep res- 
ervoirs of wisdom, love, and beauty that the great educators of every generation 
refresh their failing stores of inspiration and power, and go forth “ with strength 
renewed, like the eagles,” ‘‘to fight the good fight” for the children and ‘‘keep the 
faith ” in education as the soul of the nation’s life.

  800 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
HENRY BARNARD IN WISCONSIN. 
‘The period between January, 1855, when Dr. Barnard resigned his second school 
superintendency of Connecticut, and June, 1859, when he assumed the position of 
chancellor of the University and agent of the board of normal regents of the 
State of Wisconsin, was by no means barren of results to this indefatigable edu- 
cator. He had revisited Europe, and for him a visit anywhere was an occasion 
for careful observation. The American Journal of Education was begun, anda 
score of valuable articles, each a treatise, had been prepared for its pages. But 
three more essays at a life of executive activity were to be made before he could 
give himself fully to the great labor of his last thirty-five years, even yet pro- 
longed; the brief and energetic episode of his presidency of the University of Wis- 
consin from June 1, 1859, to January 1, 1861; the even more brief and less event- 
ful assumption of the presidency of St. John’s College, Maryland, in 1866; and 
his final work, as first Commissioner of the national Bureau of Education, from 
1867 to 1870. Our present interest is chiefly concerned with the first of these 
terms of educational supervision. 
The early history of the common school in Wisconsin has elsewhere been told, 
and it only remains to glance at the condition of popular education in this new 
State in 1858 in order to frame the familiar figure of the man who by this time had 
richly earned the title ‘‘ The national educator.” Among the frequent educational 
visits of Dr. Barnard, ranging from Charleston, 8. C., to the new Northwest, per- 
haps the most fruitful was his appearance at Madison, Wis., at the invitation of 
Hon. John H. Tweedy, in 1846, to present the subject of popular education to the 
constitutional convention of the Territory. At ameeting called for that purpose, 
Dr. Barnard outlined a scheme for public education which, reduced to writing, 
was practically accepted and incorporated in the constitution then submitted to 
the people. It included local taxation in connection with the distribution of the 
State school fund; a general superintendency of education, and the establishment 
of a State university, with a normal school department. This constitution was 
rejected by the people. But in 1848 the same provisions became a portion of the 
new scheme as a permanent article of the fundamental law. The subsequent 
legislation under the constitutional provision was largely drawn from Michigan, 
the first Northwestern State that had at once put on the ground an effective and 
complete system of public education without the violent struggle and long delays 
that hindered the effort in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. 
In 1851 the State of Wisconsin was admitted to the Union, with a population of 
305,391. The State was indebted to Mr. Root, afterwards first State superintend- 
ent of common schools, for the present wording of the educational clause, and he 
seems to have been largely influenced by a graduate of the Albany, N. Y., normal 
school, a pupil of Principal Page, who was then a teacher in the Territory. The 
common-school ship was bravely launched with only one-half the ‘children of 
school age (4 to 20) on board, at the moderate expenditure of $76,000. But in the 
stimulating air of the new Northwest all good things grow apace. In nine years 
the large sum, for a new State forty years ago, of more than $1,000,000 had been 
expended for the common schools, more than one-fourth the entire revenue of the 
State. A series of active superintendents—Root, Ladd, Wright, and Barry—had 
urged on the State to grapple with the situation. For nine years in succession a 
new recruited army of children, 25,000, appeared each year at the schoolhouse 
door. 
In 1858 Wisconsin nominally stood at the head of the common-school States in 
the proportional number of children of school age. Her school fund, derived from 
the national gift of public lands, was already $3,000,000, with a prophecy of 
$5,000,000 in a not distant future. There were already a score of free high schools 
established in as many of the larger towns. Milwaukee boasted a schoolhouse

costing $28,000. The university had already been founded, but was hardly yet in 
vital touch with the people, its whole number of students not exceeding 100, 
with a smaller number in actual collegiate studies. The department of instruction 
under Professor Reid scarcely numbered a score of young men. 
The administration of Hon. Lyman C. Draper, in 1858-59, as represented in his 
voluminous and vigorous reports as State superintendent of education, seems to 
have marked anew era. These documents, like many subsequent reports from 
the State and local superintendents of education in the Northwest, are elaborate 
treatises on the public school question, with long quotations from the foremost 
educators of our own and other countries, important declarations of celebrated 
statesmen, pages of interesting correspondence conducted by the school authori- 
ties of the State, and eloquent appeals to the laudable pride and ambition of 
new Commonwealths in constant peril of being absorbed in the exasperating con- 
flicts of partisan politics and the material development of a new country. Among 
other topics the great importance of the superior training of teachers is discussed 
atlength. After an intermittent debate of six years, the legislature of 1857 had 
passed a law for the establishment of a normal school fund from the income of an 
extensive region of swamp lands—a misleading name for a vast area containing 
much valuable real estate. The yearly income was to be divided among such col- 
leges, academies, and high schools as were willing to submit themselves to an 
examination and partial supervision by a board of State normal regents. The 
law also provided for a normal department in the university, and a small appro- 
priation was made for a professorship of pedagogy as an annex to another chair of 
instruction. 
But even then the enormous work of launching a new American State as 
extensive, at that date, as each of a dozen European kingdoms, was only begun. 
Superintendent Draper declares that nearly 100,000 children and youth, one-third 
of the entire school population from 4 to 20, were in no school. This was not so 
poor a record as it may seem, since an overwhelming majority of the children in 
the Union even now leave school before the age of 14, and in a new Territory, 
thronged by recent immigration, the labor of boys and girls between 12 and 20 
would be an important consideration. Of 244,000 children and youth of school 
age, 167,000 were enrolled in the common schools, with 90,000 outside. In the 
the same year Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana reported but one-half, Illinois one- 
fourth, and Massachusetts and New York three-fourths of their school enumera- 
tion in attendance. But itis probable that in New York and Massachusetts the 
school age was shorter at both ends. In 1857 there were, in round numbers, in 
Wisconsin 4,000 school districts and 3,480 schoolhouses, one-third built of logs, 
and a school property of $1,127,000. Male teachers received $27 and females $15 
per month; 1,375 school libraries contained 38,000 volumes. In nine years after 
its admission to the Union as a State Wisconsin had expended $2,000,000 upon its 
public schools, one-fourth of the entire public expenditure of the Commonwealth. 
The annual income of the school fund of $3,000,000 was $200,000, 75 cents for each 
person of school age in theState. Training for teachers had been well secured by 
a provision that one-fourth of the income of the public swamp lands should be a 
perpetual fund for this purpose. Teachers’ instijutes had been established and 
several institutions of learning had availed themselves of the appropriation for 
normal instruction. 
It was under these flattering conditions that Dr. Henry Barnard was called 
from his laborious literary retirement to renewed activity, this time in the super- 
vision of the higher and normal departments of education. Each of these in Wis- 
consin was under a separate organization and both were a portion of the public 
school system. His previous appearance in the State, with the added experience 
of twelve years in Rhode Island and Connecticut, had aroused the highest expec-

  802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tations. Superintendent Draper devotes a generous space in his report of 1857 
to an account of the public career of the great educator, and heralds his coming 
in the following eloquent words: “As a promoter of the cause of education, the 
career of Dr. Barnard has no precedent and no parallel. We have reason to felici- 
tate ourselves on the acquirement of sucha man. It ought to form a new era in 
our State history, and it will if we are true to ourselves and true tohim. We 
shall best favor ourselves and bless the State by listening confidingly to and carry- 
ing into effect whatever suggestions and advice such a man as Henry Barnard, 
with his ripe experience and noble devotion to the good of his race, may deem it 
his duty to offer on matters pertaining to the great cause of popular education in 
Wisconsin.” Certainly, with a public school term of but five and one-half 
months, 1,000 children in one all-out-doors county unable to attend school for 
lack of proper clothing, and only two-thirds of the school population, all in need 
of instruction, inside even a log schoolhouse, the coming of this man of national 
reputation, ‘trailing clouds of glory” from his abundant success in the far-off 
East, was an apparition to awaken the most extravagant demonstrations of an 
excited frontier expectation. 
Dr. Barnard was called to the chancellorship of the university and the agency 
of the board of regents of the normal-school fund in 1857. His coming had also 
been announced by State Superintendent Barry as ‘‘ the most important event in 
our educational history, if not, indeed, the most important, in view of its public 
consequences, that has ever transpired in the history of the State.” His specific 
duties as agent of the normal board of regents was “to visit and exercise a super- 
vising control over the normal departments of all such institutions as shall apply 
for a participation in the normal school fund, to conduct teachers’ institutes and 
normal instruction in the same, and to cooperate with the superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction in procuring a series of public educational addresses to be delivered 
in the various parts of the State.” It was even declared that “the State was 
passed over, as it were, into Dr. Barnard’s hands.” 
It was a very difficult and, on its face, a vastly greater opportunity than the call 
of Horace Mann at an earlier date to the presidency of Antioch College, Ohio; 
financially bankrupt from the start and environed by a thorny wilderness of secta- 
rian, provincial, and personal jealousies. But the very extravagance of the great 
expectation and the pathetic confidence of the educational public of an entire 
Commonwealth in Dr. Barnard’s case was, in itself, the chief peril of the situa- 
tion. The school affairs of the State were in the condition of a lusty youth 
every year ‘‘ outgrowing his clothes” and plunging into life under the combined 
supervision of two ‘‘ governors,” each looking somewhat askance at the other 
and both a good deal at sea concerning the proper management and the probable 
cost and outcome of training their precious charge. The two bodies of regents 
and the common school authorities, represented by the State superintendent of 
instruction, were getting into action without strictly defined definition of their 
respective duties. And it was several years before the present university and 
normal school system were finally established on a foundation as nearly ideal as 
may be expected in an American Commonwealth, the university supported by an 
ample tax on all the property of the State, and the five normal schools and teach- 
ers’ institutes provided for by a permanent fund of $1,000,000. 
The actual coming of Dr. Barnard was delayed till June 1, 1859." But, as usual, 
he began the work with the tremendous impetus of the great sweeping machine 
that does the work of a small brigade of men wielding the old-time street brush- 
broom. It is recorded that the new chancellor, contrary to the practice of the 
regulation college president of the day, confined his labors in the university to 
his proper sphere of supervision—the laboring oar being still worked by the faith- 
ful Professor Sargent, practically the continuous ‘‘dean of the faculty,” through 
the most trying early period of the institution—and gave little time to instruction.
-P-A-G-E-883
  HENRY BARNARD. 803 
But there was an ample and more urgent field for his peculiar genius in the 
organization of the difficult normal enterprise that had been undertaken by the 
State. At once he took the agencies on the ground in hand and worked in good 
faith, whatever may have been his private judgment concerning the system in 
operation. He introduced a series of oral and written examinations of thenormal 
classes in the colleges, academies, and high schools. In this he did all that could 
be done to lift the discarded New York system of subsidizing irresponsible private 
seminaries for training the teachers of the public schools. The effort was doubtless 
somewhat beneficial, although it only amounted to a compromise with the public 
obligation of establishing a system of State normal schools. This work was 
delayed by the oncoming and outbreak of the civil war. The normal department 
of the State University, under the pedagogic superintendence of Professors Reid 
and Charles A. Allen, never became an element of considerable importance. Per- 
haps its best result was in opening the doors of the university to women, for the 
large majority of the normal students were of that sex. 
Another excellent service was the republication of four of the educational docu- 
ments that were now appearing from the indefatigable pen of Dr. Barnard. Of 
these papers treating of the organization, instruction, and discipline of common 
schools 1,000 copies were sold among the teachers of the State. 
But Dr. Barnard gave his most effective service in Wisconsin through the insti- 
tutes for teachers. He was the true father of this national normal school on 
wheels, and up to this period no man had it so well in hand. During the autumn 
following his advent in the State he had organized and conducted with marked 
success a series of institutes in twenty counties, that reached three-fourths of the 
teachers in Wisconsin. Several prominent educators were called in as workers 
in this field, in which Dr. Barnard was himself the most inspiring of leaders. 
Several of these gentlemen remained in prominent positions in the State. In his 
last report Superintendent Draper writes “the gratifying success which has 
attended the teachers’ institutes under the direction of Chancellor Barnard, held 
during the past autumn, should be regarded as among the most hopeful signs of 
the times.” ‘‘ First and foremost is the great work of providing a better educa- 
tion for the masses of the people, and like Saul, the son of Kish, ahead and shoul- 
ders above his fellows, is Henry Barnard. He comes to us ripe in educational 
experience, and is devoting with unflagging energy the best years of his life to 
the honor and glory of Wisconsin. In the marked success which has attended 
the series of teachers’ institutes held at various points in the State during the past 
autumn we have the strongest assurance of the future. Our normal schools, our 
teachers’ institutes, and teachers’ associations, these all-important agencies in ele- 
vating the character of the free schools, will all feel the genial influence of his per- 
suasive instruction and themarvelous power of his zeal, his talents, and his genius. 
With such a leader all should be proud to follow, and for such an educator, all 
untiring as he is in devising plans for the achievement of ayet higher standard of 
intellectual improvement, we should all—legislators, school officials, teachers, 
and people—feel it always a privilege and a duty to strengthen his hands and 
encorrage his efforts.” 
There is no evidence that the educational public or the people of Wisconsin 
were disappointed in their expectations-of the value of the services of their new 
citizen educator. But the time of his coming was not auspicious for the cause of 
education. Already were the clouds thickening along the horizon that prognosti- 
cated the breaking of the awful tempest of the civil war. Wisconsin was among 
the most radical and earnest even of the Western States in its policy of resistance 
to what it regarded the aggressions of the slave power, and in its legislation con- 
cerning the return of fugitive slaves had practically thrown down the gage of 
battle. During the short eighteen months of Dr. Barnard’s residence in the 
State—June, 1859, to January, 1861—the public mind was like a troubled sea, and 
not even a pilot as enthusiastic and confident of himself as Dr. Barnard could 
   
-P-A-G-E-884

have steered in safety through the raging billows. And it had already been 
demonstrated that he was not by temperament or physical constitution in his own 
highest place in the post of school administration. Even in Rhode Island and 
Connecticut, excellent as were the results of his labors, it is not improbable that 
his greatest influence was through the wide circulation of his written documents 
that were “flying on the wings of the wind” all over the country and even across 
the ocean, with his frequent visits to different portions of the United States, where 
he appeared like an inspiration, and left everybody more assured of the good 
cause. And not the least notable of his qualities was that ‘‘ persuasive faculty of 
instruction,” the genial temperament which De Quincey declares the evidence of 
all true genius, which amid the dogged conservatism of the old Connecticut and 
Rhode Island East and the perilous enthusiasms of the new, progressive West, 
left him always the same,impervious to public approbation or neglect, ever intent 
on the main object in view. 
Such a man is always weighted with a double burden, the inflexible will and 
tireless industry to do the work at hand and the even more exhausting mental 
occupation of watching the issues of all movements as they bear on the general 
outcome of the nation’s life. It was this, a man carrying a whole country on his 
shoulders along with the active administration of the most vital interests of one 
community, which eventually broke down the oversensitive physical constitution 
of Dr. Barnard. This time the collapse came even while his followers admired 
and published abroad his untiring energy of labor. In 1861 he resigned, again 
prostrated and in sore need of what he called ‘‘entire rest.” 
In 1860 Superintendent Pickard, the successor of Superintendent Draper, him- 
self one of the ablest and most honored educators of the new West, speaks thus 
of Dr. Barnard in his first report: ‘‘Several volumes of great value to teachers 
have been prepared and published during the year by Hon. Henry Barnard. They 
have been meeting with a ready sale, as they certainly deserve. Dr. Barnard has 
given such an impetus to the cause of common-school education and, through these 
volumes above alluded to, has furnished such effective helps to the teachers as will 
cause universal regret at the necessity under which he is laid of seeking the 
restoration of overtasked and wasted energy by entire absence from the scene of 
labor. Much has been anticipated from the labors of a man so widely known and 
so universally respected as Dr. Barnard. Much has already been done. Sick- 
ness has checked, but, I trust, not entirely ended his work with us.” 
It was perhaps fortunate that his retirement was thus forced upon him so early 
in his career of usefulness in the Northwest. The great civil war was now upon 
the country and it would have been impossible to have carried on the work of 
administering the higher educational affairs of such a State as Wisconsin with 
satisfaction to himself during the coming five years. He had already sounded his 
own high note of a broad and practical consecration to the cause of the children. 
And Wisconsin, like all these great Commonwealths, had at home an adequate 
supply of executive educators who, better than any leader, however famous, from 
elsewhere, could yuide the people through the difficulties of a permanent estab- 
lishment of public education. Dm Barnard returned to the work that always 
stood waiting for him, the editorship of the American Journal of Education, which 
was but another name for the compilation of the first great educational encyclo- 
pedia which, after the test of a generation, remains the noblest collection of 
material for the study of the growth of every department of educational activity 
through its development from the origin of the American colonies to the second 
century of the national life. 
The termination of Dr. Barnard’s connection with the University of Wisconsin 
was the proper close of his executive contribution to the great revival of education 
previous to the outbreak of the civil war. His subsequent temporary presidency 
of St. John’s College, Maryland, and his final services as first Commissioner of the 
national Bureau of Education, between 1865 and 1870, pertain to a later period.
-P-A-G-E-885

The American Journal of Education. 
But all these labors, now continued for twenty-five years in official life in three 
States, with a constant habit of visitation, observation, and advice through the 
Union, were but the overture to the grand opera of the life of Henry Barnard. 
By native genius, temperament, habits of study, and a wondrous facility of liter- 
ary production, he was by common consent the chief representative of the literary 
side of the great educational revival during the thirty years previous to the civil 
war. Compared with his omnivorous intelligence, the researches and reports of 
all the educators who visited Europe during this fruitful period pass into eclipse. 
It was of the first importance that when the attention of the American people 
was directed, as it has never been but once since, to the national lead of popular 
education, the leaders of public opinion should not be left to the partial and local 
results of the experimenting and experience of the first generation of the national 
life. While everything coming from abroad must be adapted to our own national 
characteristic ideals and methods of education, it is still of the first importance 
that the American educational public should be placed in close relation with the 
great educational theories, systems, and practices of the peoples whose achieve- 
ments have been the most notable of the civilized world. It was also asimportant 
that the different States and sections of our own country, originally separated by 
obstinate provincial prejudices, should be brought together bya fair comparison 
of the best that had been done in every State and section. Here was a field so 
interesting that it is not remarkable that a mind so capacious and a spirit so 
catholic as Henry Barnard should, early in his career, have planned a lifework to 
meet this imperative demand. 
As early as the beginning of his educational career, in Connecticut in 1838, this 
idea had possession of him. The Connecticut Journal of Education was only a 
rehearsal of the great educational library and encyclopedia now known as the 
thirty-one volumes of the Henry Barnard American Journal of Education. ‘The 
same idea runs through it. While containing a great deal of valuable matter 
adapted to the condition of the schools in Connecticut, every number was ballasted. 
by asolid treatise, often in the form of a report in some direction, that was an 
exhaustive treatment of an important theme. At the close of his first term of 
secretaryship in Connecticut, in 1842, his great plan of a history of education in 
the United States seems to have been clearly before his mind, and he commenced 
the preparation of documents containing the results of his studies, reenforced by 
his valuable experience of superintendency. The call to Rhode Island suspended 
the proper development of his plan; but it was partially carried out in the publi- 
cation of the Rhode Island Journal of Education, which was the continuation of 
the method of editing already seen in the Connecticut Journal. During hissecond 
term of service in Connecticut the aid of the legislature was.granted to the publi- 
cation of a series of papers of great value, including the history of school legisla- 
tion in that State. 
The materials were already at hand for a proper beginning of his long- 
contemplated work. In December, 1854, Dr. Barnard presented to the American 
Association for the Advancement of Education, held in the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion in Washington, a broad ‘plan of a central agency for the advancement of 
education in the United States.” It was received with favor by the association 
and a committee appointed to carry it into effect ‘‘as far as the funds of the asso- 
ciation would permit.” It is impossible, in reading over the vast project then 
outlined by Dr. Barnard, to see anything but the original conception of what is 
now the central American agency, the national Bureau of Education, of which 
Dr. Barnard was the first commissioner, from 1867 to 1870. Almost every feature 
of the present Bureau, even the contemplated journal, which is represented by 
the Bureau’s ‘‘ circulars of information,” was there seen in prospect by the great 
American educator. But there was then neither the funds nor even the disposi-
-P-A-G-E-886
    806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tion to venture out to sea on a voyage so uncertain by the committee of the 
association. 
Therefore, true to the most characteristic habit of aman of genius—to under- 
take on his own responsibility what no one else could be persuaded to attempt— 
Dr. Barnard, in 1855, in connection with Rev. Dr. Peters, who had edited the 
College Review and Educational Magazine, published in August, 1855, as a liter- 
ary venture, the first volume of the American Journal of Education and Col- 
lege Review. At the end of the second volume, December, 1856, this arrange- 
ment had come toa natural end, and the American Journal of Education was 
announced by Henry Barnard. To this work he has consecrated his whole life, 
even to-day lingering around its final arrangements. In the present shape it isa 
library of thirty-one stout volumes of 800 pages each, 25,000 pages; a proper ency- 
clopedia of education. During the past twenty-five years the international expo- 
sitions at Vienna and Paris have shown their appreciation of this work by gifts 
of bronze, silver, and gold medals, responsive to similar acknowledgments at 
home. The foremost educators of all nations have declared that it is the most 
valuable collection of educational materials in the literature of any language. 
The conception of this great work was worthy of the broad and generous mind of 
Henry Barnard and could only have been realized by an educator of his peculiar 
characteristics. The first circular announcement, in 1855, reads as follows: ‘“‘In 
the great educational movement now going forward on this continent, and espe- 
cially throughout all the States in which the English language prevails, there has 
seemed for many years to the undersigned to exist, if not a demand, at least the 
want of not only an American association of the friends of universal education, 
but also of a series of publications which should, on the one hand, embody the 
mature views and varied experience of wise statesmen, educators, and teachers 
in perfecting the organization, administration, instruction, and discipline of 
schools of every grade through a succession of years, under widely varying cir- 
cumstances of government, society, and religion; and on the other hand, expose 
real deficiencies, excite to prudent and efficient action, and serve as a medium of 
free and frequent communication between thefriends of education in every portion 
of these great fields.” 
The editor also describes it as ‘‘a series of publications, including a periodical 
to be issued monthly or quarterly, devoted exclusively to the history, discussion, 
and statement of systems, institutions, and methods of education in different 
countries, with special reference to the condition and wants of our own.” And 
with that wise policy, which is only the law of truth, love, and justice applied to 
a subject so involved with infinite possibilities of difference and discord as general 
education, he pledges himself ‘‘to studiously avoid the insertion of all topics or 
papers foreign to the great subject to which it is devoted, or of a single line or 
word calculated to injure intentionally the feelings of any faithful laborer in any 
portion of the great field of American education.” 
Such words of healing import must have come like a balm upon the discordant 
host that the “faithful laborers in the great field of American education” was in 
1855. And when we remember that, of all American educators, even not except- 
ing Horace Mann, no writer of first-rateeminence had so bravely stood up for the 
highest and best, even as an official in his own State had exposed with a severity 
so relentless the faults, follies, and perils of the prevailing system of public instruc- 
tion, we can understand what a task this man set before himself and what were 
the probabilities of success in a plan apparently so visionary. 
‘That it did succeed after a fashion so decisive that the thirty-one volumes of. 
the American Journal and Library of Education for a full half century after its 
first clear conception by Dr. Barnard remain still unique and unrivaled in any 
language is the most complete testimony not only to the historical but to the 
great literary genius of its author. And when to this we add the even more per- 
tinent fact that all this was done with no effective cooperation from the publish-
-P-A-G-E-887
HENRY BARNARD. 807 
ing fraternity, even with a scant support from the professional class for whom it 
was specially compiled, at the financial ruin of one of the most devoted educa- 
tional apostles of the country and period, our interest and admiration rises to rev- 
erence, Thepractical destruction of such a work, as Robert Herbert Quick wrote, 
would be equivalent to the “pulling down of one of our cathedrals and selling 
the stones for building material,” and this was averted to some extent by the 
useful ‘analytical index,” prepared as a guide through the vast and bewildering 
spaces of this wilderness of precious material. It will be indeed a reflection on 
the intelligence, not to say the gratitude, of the American educational public if 
a final editor is not found who can so rearrange and classify this work and bring 
its historical record of education down to date as to realize the splendid ideal 
which, like a guiding star, held its devoted author up to long years of research 
and financial sacrifice through the latter twenty-five years of his life. 
Indced, the neglect of appreciation that compelled Henry Barnard to such toils 
and sacrifices was but another evidence of the inability even of an educated and 
patriotic community to compass the aim and end of a scheme so vast or to under- 
stand that aman may be defeated on the grandest line of operation for lack of 
the most ordinary sympathy and material support. Even to-day an enthusiastic 
and successful teacher of a mission school of 500 children, with a photograph of 
his building and a club of singers, can collect more money in a week in any great 
American city than the United States Commissioner of Education in his heroic 
endeavor to lift up to permanent recognition this greatest literary educational 
work of the Republic, indorsed by the foremost educators of the world. By a 
singular fallacy of even the cultivated imagination and philanthropic sentiment, 
the man who “‘lives and moves and has his being” in the capacious realm of far- 
reaching and universal plans is supposed to have at his command the resources of 
the whole country for its prosecution. But the venerable author of this noble 
work may yet have to add the final wreath to his ‘‘crown of rejoicing” that not 
only has every position, ideal, and plan of his general scheme of popular educa- 
tion become the commonplace of the American common school, but his own world 
picture of education in all its departments has been accepted and esteemed as it 
deserves. 
The plan of Dr. Barnard in this publication was like the dream of Lord Bacon 
in the Organon—to take all education for his province. The work gives in suffi- 
cient measure and detail for the practical understanding and use of the general 
reading public of the United States a fair history of education from the earliest 
ages to the present time. Its account of the great modern revival of the educa- 
tional spirit and methods, under the leadership of central Europe, from Comenius 
to Froebel, is ample for general understanding and use. Its résumé of educa- 
tional history and recent activity in Great Britain lays a solid foundation for the 
just comprehension of the Colonial and early national history of our American 
common school. Its elaborate illustrations of the new education—academie, col- 
legiate, scientific, and industrial—in our own country is so intelligent that even 
the humblest inquirer can read. A careful examination of this great work by a 
competent reader will explain the fact that every essential feature and the most 
effectual methods of our present common school life have been outlined, sug- 
gested, and elaborated in their present form during the educational career of its 
author. 
The complaint of the class of critics who find only confusion and evidence of 
careless, unskiliful, and crude editorship in this great encyclopedia is rather a 
criticism of their own lack of appreciation of his situation and of the environ- 
ment of his work than of the author. Dr. Barnard did not propose to prepare a 
universal encyclopedia of education or build a monument of literary enterprise. 
His large and unique scholarship and catholicity of appreciation for all nations 
and peoples was shot through and through with an intense and practical patriot-

808 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
ism. He declares at the outset his intention to do all this ‘‘with special refer- 
ence to the conditions and wants of our own country.” 
It was not only excusable but absolutely necessary to condense important works, 
to present high scientific methods and profound philosophical systems of educa- 
tion in intelligible shape, and generally to adjust, apply, and concentrate the 
entire wealth of Old World thinking and doing with special reference to this end. 
Henry Barnard, with ail his preoccupation in broad views and prophetic plans, 
was no builder of educational air castles, but a true son of old Connecticut and 
the Republic, always working with a clear picture before him of the last little 
school he had visited or the most destitute or neglected hamlet inthe land. In this 
he was an instructive example for so many ambitious educators who now insist 
on forcing not only Old World methods of instruction but of administration on 
our national school life. 
. The complaint that the information concerning educational affairs in our own 
. country is not classified and wrought into a connected and complete history in 
| this work only reveals the lack of knowledge of the actual condition of educational 
| affairs in our country even to-day, not to say during the period when its mate- 
. rials were collected. In half the Union, through fifteen States, until twenty-five 
years ago there was no reliable collection of the materials for such a history. 
The common school as we know it, save in a few cities and in an imperfect condi- 
| tion in two or three States, did not exist until several years after the close of the

. civil war. The multitude of private schools of every conceivable grade, not to 
mention the academical and collegiate foundations, have no established habit even 
. of reporting their own conditions, much less of collecting statistics of their own 
class of seminaries. 
The labors of Horace Mann and Henry Barnard may be said to have created 
the science of educational statistics in the United States. Until the past twenty- 
five years no serious attempt has been made to write a reliable history of educa- 
tion in any American State, and to-day the attempts at that history in the reports 
of Mann and Barnard are the best attainable accounts of the common school, 
even in the two States where it had its birth. It was fortunate that Dr. Barnard 
in 1842 did not give himself, as he first proposed, to writing a history of American 
education up to date. His attempt to collect the materials by travel, correspond- 
ence, indefatigable labor, and large expenditure of time and money must have 
early convinced him of the futility of such an undertaking. Until 1860 the 
. National Library at Washington, according to the statement of its present emi- 
nent Director, ‘‘ had never taken in pamphlets;” and in pamphlets and newspapers 
alone, in many of the States, could be found any considerable record of education 
during the first two hundred years of the colonial and national life. 
In place of this, Dr. Barnard did what could only be done at that time. He 
gave himself, with the tireless industry and boundless patience that makes every 
great collector a national ‘‘ bore,” to the collection of every fragment of impor- 
tant information, every memorial of the most ordinary school, every monograph 
of a valuable institution, every plan of a schoolhouse or public structure for edu- 
cational or philanthropic use—all statements, probably often misleading and col- 
. ored by the personal ambitions and narrow outlook of local educators, and plans 
of operation by any sort of ‘‘faithful workers.” All this required a largeness of 
mind and capacity of sympathetic appreciation only possible to an observer of 
; original genius and great practical faculty. Dr. Barnard took information as it 
came, and gave it as it was, and secured it in its own place in the 25,000 pages 
of his 31 crowded volumes. 
This vast collection of useful and original material, twenty-five years ago, was 
all that could be called a history of education in the United States. The true 
historical inquirer, even of to-day, can well appreciate the difficulties that beset 
Dr. Barnard in such an undertaking, and the priceless value of much that is 
found in this great treasure house of information. Often in half a page will be

found a clew to the understanding of the educational history of an entire period 
in the school conditions of a Commonwealth. The popular letters of a New 
England traveler in Pennsylvania, Illinois, or Tennessee may explain why the 
common school could not exist there till ‘‘ the veil was taken away from before 
the face” of their people. This great work does indeed require the labors of a 
competent editor, working not in the interest of any pet theory or with a fore- 
gone determination to reconstruct any portion of the country or shatter any 
present reputation, but to condense, collate, and, if possible, put in better shape 
for the use of the country for which it was intended the vast and rich deposits in 
this great educational ‘‘ placer,” out of which the fortunes of a succession of 
pedagogic aspirants have been already realized, and which will remain a ‘“‘ gold- 
bearing” mine through generations to come. 
With this account of the services of Dr. Henry Barnard, up to the year 1860, on 
the edge of thé black cloud that was surging up from the horizon to herald the 
terrible five coming years, not even rolled by in 1870, the opening period of the 
second great revival of the American common school, we close this biographical 
sketch of the lives of the two great leaders in New England of the movement that 
revolutionized and reconstructed the original common-school system of the coun- 
try. Here the common school was, from the first, a literary institution, under 
charge and in contact with the literary class. Its most influential administrators 
were clergymen and teachers; even the majority of the most distinguished public 
men of this section had at one time been teachers. Hence in New England the 
revival of the common school came up from and was held fast in the hands of the 
leading educational class, and the educational public was but another name 
for the educated people. The theological agreement among the Congregational 
churches which represented the only original American ecclesiastical polity and 
the homogeneity of the New England population kept the common school for the 
time outside the disastrous conflicts of creeds. What we now call ‘the religious 
question” was not a disturbing element, although the schools were greatly 
affected by the intense religious life of the time. Here and among the great body 
of those who swarmed from the old New England hive into the region beyond the 
Hudson River, we notice a great interest in the pursuit of education as a science. 
Horace Mann and Henry Barnard and the group of able school men and women 
that gathered around them became the foremost representatives of the great 
revival of the common school, and their powerful influence was felt through the 
entire country during the thirty years from 1830 to 1860. 
We have presented these great leaders of the progressive American educational 
public at this period because it was only in New England that such a crisis could 
have appeared at the close of the first half century of the nation’s life. And only 
in the two States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, where the American common 
school had its birth, where through the one hundred and fifty years of the colonial 
period it was the real popular university, and where it was near to the people’s 
heart, might such leaders be expected to appear. From the first the common 
school in New England was in charge of the educated class. The Congregational 
clergy was still the leading educational body and the leader of the professional 
class up to 1830, and this was the most effective agency by which the State and 
the towns administered the public will in every department of education. 
When we come to the great Middle States, the scene changes. The division of 
the people in their cosmopolitan civilization, owing to diversity of nationality, 
sect, and social caste, so involved the clergy and the teaching profession that the 
complete establishment of the common school was finally an upward movement 
from the people, engineered by and for many years virtually under the direction 
of the most progressive statesmen and the secular professional class. Hawley 
and Wadsworth and Seward, Dr. Franklin, Dr. Rush, and Thaddeus Stevens, 
Bishops Doane and Potter, the famous secretaries of state in New York—Spencer, 
Dix, and Young; Daniel D. Barnard and the Randalls and the group of eminent
-P-A-G-E-890
  810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
public men like Van Rensselaer, and many of the eminent lawyers and mer- 
chants of the metropolis were, until a late period, the leaders of popular educa- 
tion. Even during the revival period, beginning in 1830, with the exception of 
Dwight and Page, no large number of prominent educators appeared to follow the 
steps of Dr. Eliphalet Nott and Mrs. Emma Willard. 
The new ‘Great West,” then hardly including the five Northwestern States east 
of the Mississippi, even until the civil war, owed the upbuilding of the higher 
grades of their educational systems largely to the labors of men who were pro- 
foundly interested in the public-school movement. Their leading college and 
academical presidents and professors were largely imported from the East and 
were so devoted to the denominational seminaries and colleges that the people 
were left a good deal to their more intelligent politicians and progressive men of 
affairs for the final establishment of the common school. 
The Southern States, though including half the number of Comm®nwealths and 
more than half the settled area of the Republic, had little part in this general 
movement for the revival of the common school, outside the border and a few 
cities of the Southern Atlantic and Gulf States. Owing to the increasing agita- 
tion of the slavery question, it is doubtful if the negroes enjoyed the opportunity 
of the occasional instruction of their more capable class as in former years. The 
great mass of the nonslaveholding white people, with the usual exceptions of 
youth of marked natural superiority in ability and energy, were still left to the 
meager supply of the “field” and private schools and whatever satisfaction could 
be gained from the free-school system of several States; generally so poor that the 
people most in need had practically ‘‘no use for it.” Three of these States had 
made a more decided and persistent effort to adopt the free common school for its 
white population—Missouri, Kentucky, and North Carolina. 
But the revival of which we now treat was not inoperative through this 
extended region. The most thoughtful educational and public men of these States 
were greatly aroused and inspired, especially by the eloquent writings of Mann, 
Barnard, and others only second in rank. The visits of Henry Barnard to the 
South, especially in New Orleans, La., and Charleston, S. C., were influential in 
the establishment of the common school for white children in several of these 
cities. Horace Mann was also consulted in regard to the establishment of the first 
public schools in New Orleans, and sent there his friend, Mr. Shaw, whose name is 
still cherished in that city. The only United States Commissioner of Education 
from the South, Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, informed the writer of this essay that his 
own interest in the public-school system was awakened and educated by the cor- 
respondence of his father with Horace Mann. 
But the South did not need to sit at the feet of the Northern section of the Union 
for instruction and encouragement in this direction. Indeed, the growing polit- 
ical hostility was probably to the prejudice of the common school as one of the 
most prominent features of Northern civilization. It was only necessary to look 
backward to Thomas Jefferson and the illustrious group of the fathers who, even 
before the establishment of the Union, joined hands with the North in the most 
important educational legislation of the century, the consecration of one thirty- 
sixth of the entire area of the national land patrimony to the education of the 
youth of all succeeding States, even at the sacrifice of their own imperative neces- 
sities, to look forward with longing eyes to the appearance of the new time coming. 
Many of the most striking appeals in behalf of public education in our national 
literature came up from these States to cheer and inspire the great workers in the 
North. No greater boon could now be offered to the South than the publication 
of a series of these documents, messages of governors, reports of legislative com- 
mittees, the proceedings of educational conventions, and written addresses by 
eminent educators, in popular form for general distriLution among the Southern 
people.

made a report on the rural school problem, through its chairman, Henry Sabin. 
©. C. Rounds, president of the council, urged immediate action, in view of the 
importance of the subject and of the growing interest in the question of improy- 
ing the condition of the rural schools. Other members joined in the discussion, 
and, on motion of B. A. Hinsdale, the chair was directed to appoint a committee 
of five, who should submit a plan for the further investigation of this subject. 
July 9 the committee reported as follows: 
Resolved, That there be undertaken, under the auspices of the council, an inves- 
tigation of the subject of rural schools, embracing such topics as revenues and 
expenditures, the constitution, organization, and duties of boards of management 
and control, and the provision of suitable teachers. More definitely, said investi- 
gation shall be conducted in general on the lines laid down in the report of the 
Committee on State School Systems submitted to the council at its present session. 
Resolved, That a committee of nine be appointed to conduct this investigation, 
said committee to consist of the following persons: Henry Sabin, of Iowa; D. L. 
Kiehle, of Minnesota; A. B. Poland, of New Jersey; C. C. Rounds, of New Hamp- 
shire; J. H. Phillips, of Alabama; B. A. Hinsdale, of Michigan; 8. T. Black, of 
California; W. 8. Sutton, of Texas, and L. E. Wolfe, of Missouri. 
Resolved, That the board of directors of the National Educational Association 
be urgently requested to appropriate, at some session to be held during the course 
of the present annual meeting, the sum of $2,500, or such part thereof as may be 
necessary, to defray the expenses of this investigation, including the publication 
of the report of the committee. 
Resolved, That the committee should report within the period of two years, in 
such form as it may determine, and that it be authorized to publish its report. 
Respectfully submitted.

Committee. 
At the same time the committee was empowered to enlarge its number to twelve, 
and to fill any vacancies which might occur. 
On the 12th day of July the directors adopted a series of resolutions, under 
which a sum not exceeding $2,500 was set aside and placed in the emergency fund 
for the use of the committee. The resolutions also provided that not more than 
$1,500 should be drawn during the year 1895-96; that no compensation should be 
allowed any member of the committee, and that the fund may be drawn upon, if 
necessary, to defray in whole or in part the publication of the report. Itis proper 
to add here that at a meeting of the directors at Buffalo, upon the request of the 
council, an additional $1,000 was placed in this fund for the use of the committee 
under the same conditions as above. 
The committee held its first meeting July 10, 1895, at which time, on motion of 
Dr. Hinsdale, the committee was increased from nine to twelve by adding the fol- 
lowing persons: W. T. Harris, Washington, D. C.; L. B. Evans, Augusta, Ga.; 
C. R. Skinner, Albany, N. Y. 
Messrs. Sabin, Kiehle, and Hinsdale were constituted a special committee to 
formulate a plan of work and furnish members with copies of the same; also to 
divide the committee into sections and to assign appropriate work to each. 
The committee as finally constituted consisted of the following gentlemen: 
Henry Sabin, Des Moines, Iowa, chairman; B. A. Hinsdale, Ann Arbor, Mich.; 
D.L. Kiehle, Minneapolis, Minn.; W.T. Harris, Washington, D.C.; A.B. Poland, 
Trenton, N.J.; C.C. Rounds, Plymouth, N.H.; J.H. Phillips, Birmingham, Ala.; 
§. T. Black, Sacramento, Cal.; W.S. Sutton, Houston, Tex.; C.R. Skinner, Albany, 
N.Y.; L. B. Evans, Augusta, Ga.; L.E. Wolfe, Kansas City, Mo. 
The special committee of ee met in Chicago October 25 and 26, 1895, and, 
after consultation, divided the entire committee into four subcommittees, andl 
assigned certain topics to each for investigation and report. These subcommittees
-P-A-G-E-893
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 813 
were constituted and the work assigned to each in accordance with the following 
schedules: 
I. School maintenance.—Subcommittee: B. A. Hinsdale, chairman; W.S. Sutton, 
8. T. Black, 
This branch of the subject was divided for convenience into three subheads: 
1. Revenues.—Permanent school funds; taxation, general and local, embracing 
State, county, township, and district taxes; miscellaneous sources of school 
income, such as fines, licenses, gifts, etc. 
2. Expenditures.—Machinery and methods of distribution, general and local. 
The main points to be considered are the channels through which the funds reach 
the schools and the rules and methods governing their distribution and application. 
3. Organization of business administrative machinery.—The county, district, 
and township unit systems; the consolidation of schools; the transportation of 
pupils; county, township, and district high schools; the relation of rural schools 
to city schools. Inquiry should be made into the main social, industrial, and eco- 
nomical factors that condition rural education, as density of population, wealth, 
means of communication, etc. 
Il. Supervision.—Subcommittee: L. B. Evans, chairman; C. R. Skinner, Henry 
Sabin. 
1. The manner of electing the superintendent, State, county, district, or town- 
ship. 
2. Minimum qualifications required of each, and term of office. 
8. The relation of the superintendent, State, county, district, or township, to the 
teachers and pupils as officer and adviser. 
4, The relation of the superintendent, State, county, district, or township, to 
school officers, and their duties. 
5. The relation of the State superintendent to the county and township superin- 
tendent. 
6. The-relation of the superintendent to the public at large, as creating and 
shaping public opinion in rural districts. 
7. The relation of the superintendent to school buildings, architecture, sanita- 
tion, and hygienic conditions. 
Ill. Supply of teachers.—Subcommittee: C. C. Rounds, chairman; J. H. Phillips, 
D. L. Kiehle. 
1. An inquiry into the assistance rendered rural schools by the following facili- 
ties for preparation: 
(a) Normal schools. 
(b) Training schools in high schools and academies. 
(c) Summer training schools. 
(d) Institutes. 
2. An inquiry into the means provided for the improvement of teachers already 
in the service: 
(a) Teachers’ meetings and associations, 
(b) Reading circles. 
(c) Libraries and current literature. 
3, An inquiry into the manner of electing, employing, and paying teachers: 
(a) By what authority examined and certificated. 
(b) By what authority employed. 
(c) Terms of engagement, certificates, and salaries paid. 
IV. Instruction and discipline.—Subcommittee: W.T. Harris, chairman; A. B. 
Poland, L. E. Wolfe. 
1. Methods of teaching and government peculiarly affecting rural schools. 
2. Courses of study, text-books, and other appliances. 
3. Working programmes. 
4. Gradation and classification of pupils.
-P-A-G-E-894
  814 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
5. The relations of rural schools to their environments; as to farm life, mining 
life, ete. 
It was also provided that the investigation of the several subdivisions of the gen- 
eral subject should follow two main lines: 
1. The condition of rural schools now existing. 
2. Changes to be recommended; what is, and what should be. 
It was not thought necessary that the committee should go into history or 
development further than to make the conditions that now exist, and the reforms 
that are recommended, intelligible. It was also recommended that changes to be 
made, or reforms to be proposed, should have respect to existing facts; that they 
should be practical in the rational sense of that word. 
It was further left to the several subcommittees to determine the methods to be 
employed in-carrying on their work, and toexercise the greatest freedom in enlist- 
ing aid from every possible source. , 
Each subcommittee was thus left free to formulate such questions as seemed best 
designed to elicit the desired information in the most definite form. 
The committee met at Jacksonville, Fla., February 18 and 19, 1896, for consulta- 
tion and comparison of results. An informal meeting was held during the ses- 
sions of the National Educational Association at Buffalo in July, 1896, at which 
time it was determined to hold a meeting of the full committee at Chicago, 
November 18 to 21, 1896. The chairman of each subcommittee was also directed 
to have such preliminary matter ready at that time as would embrace all the 
essential points necessary to a fair understanding of the scope of the final report 
to be made to the council in July. It was also voted to ask certain experts in 
rural school matters to meet with the committee, in order that it might have the 
benefit of their experience. 
The committee met at the Auditorium in Chicago, as determined. The entire 
committee was present at each session, with the exception of D. L. Kiehle, who, 
for satisfactory reasons, was not present until Thursday morning. The following 
gentlemen were present upon invitation of the chairman: 
John MacDonald, editor of the Western School Journal, Topeka, Kans.; W. W. 
Stetson, State superintendent of Maine; J. L. Pickard, of Iowa City, Iowa; O. T. 
Bright, county superintendent of Cook County, Ill; Albert G. Lane, city super- 
intendent of Chicago; D. E. McClure, county superintendent of Oceana County, 
Mich.; W. H. Chandler, of Madison, Wis.; President F. W. Parker, of the Chicago 
Normal School; G. R. Shawhan, county superintendent of Champaign County, 
Ill.; John Trainer, of Decatur, Ill.; T, C. Chamberlin, of the University of Chi- 
cago; J. J. Schobinger, of Morgan Park, Ill; W. S. Jackman, of the Chicago 
Normal School; A. W. Edson, State agent, Boston, Mass. 
Wednesday and Thursday were devoted to general discussion, one-half day 
being allotted to each of the four subcommittees in the following order: School 
maintenance, supervision, supply of teachers, and instruction and discipline. 
Friday and Saturday were devoted to the consideration of the preliminary reports 
submitted by the chairmen of the respective subcommittees. The sessions were 
held from 9 a. m. to 12m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. In order to facilitate discussion 
printed or typewritten copies of the main propositions in each report were placed 
in the hands of those present. During Friday and Saturday the reports were read 
section by section, and, after alterations and amendments as suggested by various 
members of the committee, they were adopted. 
It was further ordered that the reports of the different subcommittees should 
appear in the printed volume in the following order: 
1. School maintenance. 
2. Supervision. 
8. Supply of teachers. 
4, Instruction and discipline.
-P-A-G-E-895
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 815 
On motion the entire matter of printing the report, when completed, was 
intrusted to the charge of the chairman of the committee, with the suggestion 
that he confer with the United States Commissioner of Education in regard to 
securing the cooperation of the national bureau for publication purposes. 
T. C. Chamberlin, of the University of Chicago; W.S. Jackman, of the Chicago 
Normal School, and F. H. King, of Madison, Wis., were requested to prepare a 
discussion of the possibilities of a course of study especially adapted to agricul- 
tural environments. This discussion constitutes Appendix G of this report. 
Appendix A, consisting of a paper read by B. A. Hinsdale before the department 
of superintendence at Jacksonville, is published by order of the committee. The 
course of study for rural schools and the paper by Dr. White, designated as 
Appendix I, and the paper by F. W. Parker, Appendix H, are inserted by the 
same authority. Theother matter in the appendix has been placed there in accord- 
ance with a vote of the committee, leaving the selection to the choice of the chair- 
man of each subcommittee and of the general committee. 
The date for publication of the report was fixed at from four to six weeks before 
the meeting of the National Educational Council at Milwaukee. After determin- 
ing that the chairman of each subcommittee should send a typewritten or printed 
copy of his report to each member of the committee before publication for sugges- 
tions or amendments, the committee adjourned. 
In the foregoing historical statement no attempt has been made to follow the 
exact order of proceedings, but only to gather from the secretary’s records such 
main points as will give the council exact information of the methods adopted by 
the committee. 
As soon as possible after the adjournment of the committee the chairman of 
each subcommittee prepared his report, and printed or typewritten copies were 
sent to other members, and also in all cases to persons who were supposed to be 
able to point out omissions or to suggest alterations. As a result these reports 
represent the combined experience of many competent persons besides members of 
the committee. This method led to much correspondence on the part of the chair- 
men, but it has undoubtedly aided them very materially in making a broader and 
much more comprehensive report. The committee found itself confronted from 
the beginning with the fact that the environments of schools differ so much in 
various sections of the country that it is impossible to make other than very gen- 
eral suggestions. Conditions vary so much between Maine and California, or 
Minnesota and Texas, that what would be an excellent system in one would pos- 
sibly fail in the other. 
SCHOOL MAINTENANOE. 
Those who read the following reports will find that several recommendations 
are made by more than one subcommittee. Thus in the matter of organization 
the necessity of adopting a larger unit than the district, as the township or the 
county, is very strenuously insisted upon by two or more subeommittees. It isa 
fact of such great importance that other essential points hinge upon this. The 
arguments are very fully stated in the report of the subcommittee on school main- 
tenance, but the general committee is fully agreed upon the desirability of effecting 
this change wherever the district system at present prevails. It would conduce 
to effectiveness and simplicity of organization; to economy in the use and distri- 
bution of funds; to the equalization of the burdens of taxation, and to a system 
of supervision which would produce better results from the instruction given in 
the rural schools. 
Again, all the subcommittees are strongly in favor of the consolidation of schools 
which are too small to employ profitably the time of one teacher into larger 
schools, when practicable, in order that better instruction may be provided than 
is possible under the present system. This involves also paying for the transpor-  
-P-A-G-E-896
  816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tation of pupils to some central school at the public expense. The different sub- 
committees have reached this conclusion, each from its own standpoint. The 
inferences drawn from facts and figures are too obvious to need any argument. 
The conclusions arrived at in the discussion of the two points, organization and 
consolidation, are very broad, and would seem to be applicable to some section of 
nearly every State in the Union. 
The manner of raising and distributing the revenues has been carefully investi- 
gated, and the subcommittee having that subject in charge seems to have reached. 
very wise and just conclusions. The township or special district in which the 
parents of the pupils reside should contribute to the school funds, as should the 
county and the State. Every interest concerned in the education of children 
should bear a proportionate share of the burden of taxation. In the distribution 
of school funds, because of the community of interests involved in popular educa- 
tion, the strong and wealthy must contribute to the support of schools in weak 
and impoverished districts. It may not be possible to provide equal school facili- 
ties in every part of the State, but every district in which a school is established 
should be assured beyond all doubt of a sufficient sum of money to employ a 
competent teacher for the minimum number of months or days fixed by the law. 
The duty of providing for the pupils of the rural schools the means whereby they 
can have the benefit of high schools in their neighborhood has not been overlooked. 
It is not necessary to discuss fully these points. Attention is invited to them, as 
set forth in the report of the subcommittee on school maintenance. 
SUPERVISION, 
The subject of school supervision is discussed under the general divisions of 
State, county, township, and district. The task assigned this subcommittee is 
difficult, because, as far as rural schools are concerned, there are no well-defined 
lines of work upon which there is a general agreement. There is great need of 
supervision which is intelligent and which carries with it some degree of authority. 
As a general thing, the officer known as State superintendent has only advisory 
authority. He can make suggestions, but they carry with them no more force 
than there is in the character and influence of the officer who makes them. He is 
too far removed from the rural schools, and is too much engaged in other matters 
connected with his office, to come into close touch with them and their present 
interests. 
No one questions that supervision should be compulsory. In fact, such is the 
case in most States to-day. The great question connected with it is how to make 
it effective. A supervisor who has charge of a hundred schools or more, scattered 
over an entire county, finds it impossible to control and direct them in accordance 
with well-devised plans. Accordingly the subcommittee urges township or district 
supervision where it is practicable, or that each supervisor should have such 
deputies or assistants as will enable him to reach every part of his field. 
Again, if supervision is to be effective it must be the product of skill and 
intelligence. As well put an ordinary seaman, selected from the crew by lot, in 
charge of an ocean steamer, with its precious cargo of lives and wealth, as to 
place a raw, uncultivated man or woman, selected by the chances of a political 
convention, in charge of the schools in which our youth are being trained for cit- 
izenship. The subcommittee is of the opinion that certain qualifications, moral 
and mental, with some experience in teaching, should be exacted from everyone 
who aspires to the duties of a supervisory office. The duties which are incum- 
bent upon a supervisor of schools have been so minutely discussed that it is not 
necessary to restate them here. It is sufficient to say that knowledge and skill, 
enthusiasm and patience, sympathy and forbearance, firmness and justice, are 
requisite in one who would discharge his duties conscientiously and with due 
regard to the highest good of all concerned.
-P-A-G-E-897
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 817 
The importance of bringing the school into touch with the farm and the home 
has been dwelt upon at some length. (Appendix O.) To this end the supervisor 
should make himself thoroughly acquainted with peculiar conditions of life in his 
supervisory district. Itis not enough that he visit the school and consult with 
the teacher. He must meet school officers and parents, awaken their sympathy 
and arouse their interest, if he would do his whole duty. He must have a con- 
trolling influence in the selection of teachers, in the erection of school buildings, 
especially as concerns sanitation and hygiene, in teachers’ meetings, and in gen- 
eral school work throughout his entire territory. 
A wise supervisor can not fail to observe carefully the environments of the 
school, which exert a powerful, though unconscious, influence upon the character 
of the pupils, The bearings of the esthetical upon the ethical side of the child’s 
nature, the relations of music and art as determining the development of the 
child along right lines, should be observed and guarded as well in the rural as in 
the city schools. 
SUPPLY OF TEACHERS. 
The question of the support afforded teachers is one great hindrance in the way 
of improving the rural school. The following table, showing the average monthly 
salaries paid teachers in rural schools, has been compiled from answers to cir- 
culars sent out to State superintendents. It is unfortunate that in most States 
the statistics make no distinction between city and rural school teachers. Conse- 
quently many of the returns are estimated. They are valuable, however, for pur- 
poses of comparison and general information.

In connection with above table we must take into account that in only a few 
States is the average length of the school over eight months. This includes cities 
and towns, as well as rural districts, so that it is fair to conclude that in general 
the country teacher finds employment not to exceed seven months in a year, and 
often not more than five or six. 
The subcommittee regrets that so few are able to apprehend the qualities essen- 
tial to a good teacher. Professional fitness is ignored in nearly every case. The 
smaller the unit of organization the greater is the disposition to engage teachers 
for short periods of time. All engagements should be for one year at least, and 
frequent changes of teachers should be discouraged. 
Perhaps the most important subject intrusted to this subcommittee has refer- 
ence to the training and preparation of teachers. There isno doubt that the normal 
ED 97———52

  818 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
school in most States does not reach down and take hold of the common district 
school. There is room, as indicated in the report, for a series of normal training 
classes with a course of one year, or at most two years, not modeled after a State 
normal school, but suited in all respects to the needs of a class of young people 
from whom we draw nearly all our rural school teachers. Instruction for one 
year in such a school could be made to so inspire students with a desire for 
knowledge, to so fill them with the teaching spirit, as to work a most beneficent 
change in the schools coming under their charge. 
The proposition to establish continuous sessions in normal schools, as set forth 
in the subcommittee’s report, is full of promise for the improvement of rural 
school teachers without withdrawing them from active service. The terms and 
courses could, under the plan, be-so adjusted as to enable them to attend a normal 
school for work in regular courses of study during that large part of the year not 
occupied in teaching. A course for one year is indicated below. If extended to 
two years, the extension should consist not so much in the introduction of new 
branches as in doing something more than elementary work in the branches 
already in the curriculum.

The number of lessons in each branch per week must be determined by the con- 
ditions and necessities of the class. Singing and drawing should have such a place 
as their importance demands. At least two lessons per week for each of them 
should be insisted upon. 
The course of study to be completed in one year is arranged according to relation 
of subjects and not according to order of study. It embraces, so far as elements 
are concerned, those subjects which are necessary in order to enable a teacher to 
deal with organic and inorganic nature, with history and civil government, with 
literature and language, and with so much of music and art as the conditions of 
the school will admit. While provision is made for professional training, the suc- 
cess of such a course as this as a means for preparing teachers for their work will 
depend almost entirely upon the good judgment and skill of those who are intrusted 
with the management of the school. The tendency to overload such a course, to 
crowd two years’ work into one, will have to be very carefully guarded against. 
The entire course is intended to be only elementary, and is for the benefit of a - 
large class of teachers who have but little preparation, and are not able from 
various reasons to devote more than one year’s time to attendance upon a normal 
school. The advantages of a school of this nature would be greatly enlarged by 
the possession of a carefully selected library, and of sufficient apparatus for pur- 
poses of illustration and experiment. If the students could be taught to make 
this apparatus, with maps, charts, etc., for use in rural schools, it would add to 
their usefulness as teachers. Very great advantage would accrue to the pupils 
from coming in contact with disciplined minds in the persons of their instructors, 
But few rural teachers know how to study or how to get the most out of the 
books which fall into their hands.
-P-A-G-E-899
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 819 
Summer schools, reading circles, and institutes have received their share of 
attention. The whole ground has been well covered and will repay a careful 
perusal. 
The scheme for the examination and certification of teachers has been thoroughly 
digested. There will be some who may not agree with the subcommittee in all 
particulars, but no one will dispute the fact that too many teachers in the rural 
schools are contented with the lowest grade of certificate which will answer the 
purpose of the law. There is a great necessity for some scheme such as is here 
recommended, whereby teachers can rise step by step in their calling, if they 
earnestly desire to improve. On the other hand, this scheme furnishes a reason- 
able excuse for not affording further professional recognition of any kind to 
those who show no disposition or no ability to do anything better in the line of 
preparation for their work. 
INSTRUCTION AND DISCIPLINE. 
The report under this head will be found to embrace several important recom- 
mendations. Some of these will provoke discussion, but most of them are of 
such a nature as to commend themselves to every thoughtful person. The report 
opens a broad field of inquiry, which must of necessity receive more attention as 
the wants and necessities of rural schools are better considered. 
The evils of attempting to grade the rural school as the city school is graded 
are very clearly set forth, accompanied by the suggestion that those normal 
schools which as part of their work train teachers for rural schools should care- 
fully impress upon such teachers the necessity of considering the size of the 
school in determining the uses and abuses of grading and classifying pupils. 
This suggestion is all the more pertinent in view of the movement in many States 
to require some previous professional training as a prerequisite for entering any 
public school as a teacher, 
Considering that the course of study for the rural school need not differ in any 
material point from that provided for the city school, it is urged that the aim of 
such a course is to enable the pupil to recognize the conditions of inorganic and 
organic nature, and to pursue the studies of literature, language, and history, as 
they are necessary for his entrance upon civilization. The difference in courses 
of study for rural or city schools is found to be in those collateral branches which 
relate to the environment of the pupil or to the neighborhood in which he dwells. 
The report upon this point is very full and will repay a careful study of its details. 
The subcommittee calls especial attention to the relation of the course of study to 
the system of grading and classification. The suggestions made are of great prac- 
tical value in any discussion which endeavors to determine the method of adapt- 
ing a course of study to the wants and conditions of rural schools. It can not 
but be very helpful to be told that the course of study is the measuring rod used 
only to determine at what point in his work the pupil has arrived, and not a Pro- 
crustean bed used to give the work the lifeless beauty of a dead uniformity. 
The consolidation of those schools which have become so reduced in numbers 
as to render it unprofitable to maintain them separately, the transportation of 
pupils at public expense to other schools than their own, and the concentration 
of higher-grade pupils at a central point, are urged as means of lessening many of 
the evils from which rural schools are suffering. This provision, having been 
grafted into the law of several States, bids fair to prove of great benefit. Wher- 
ever it has been tried it has commended itself as economical and as a means of 
affording better teachers and consequently better schools. The matter of im- 
proved roads enters incidentally into this discussion, as haying great bearing 
upon the question of transporting children to central points for school purposes. 
In connection with school exercises at the town or county center once or twice 
a year, competitive examinations are not recommended unless they are very care-

  820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
fully guarded. The feature of social intercourse, the stimulus which comes from 
meeting with his mates, have advantages which ought not to be overlooked or 
neglected. 
Home reading, with what is termed school extension, is dwelt upon at such 
length as its prominence demands (Appendix O). Tocarry good reading material, 
whether of science, literature, or fiction, prose or poetry, into the schools and 
homes of the rural districts must be a part of any educational scheme which has 
for its object making country life more endurable or more attractive. The vari- 
ous recommendations of this part of the report are worthy of careful considera- 
tion at the hands of those even who may not wholly agree with them. 
CONCLUSION. 
Your committee has called in the aid of a number of persons whose time 
and thought have been largely given to matters connected with the manage- 
ment and instruction best suited to the wants of rural schools. It was found 
impossible to embrace the entire matter placed at our disposal in the body of the 
report. We have, therefore, printed much of it in the form of an appendix, 
believing that it will add largely to the value of this report. It is not to be sup- 
posed that every point has been covered, or that the entire subject has been 
exhausted. The committee has endeavored diligently and to the best of its ability 
to throw some light upon what may possibly be regarded as a collection of sub- 
jects embracing a very large field. While there are many points worthy of espe- 
cial attention, I have gathered up the following as a brief summary of those which 
may be considered of most pressing importance: 
SUMMARY. 
1. For purposes of organization, maintenance, or supervision, nothing should 
be recognized as the unit smaller than the township or the county; the school dis- 
trict is the most undesirable unit possible. 
2, Every community should be required to raise a certain sum for the support 
of its schools as a prerequisite for receiving its share of public money. A cer- 
tain definite sum should be appropriated to each school out of the State funds, 
and the remainder should be divided in accordance with some fixed and estab- 
lished rule, a discrimination being made in favor of townships most willing to 
tax themselves for school purposes. 
8. One of the great hindrances to the improvement of the rural school lies in its 
isolation, and its inability to furnish to the pupil that stimulative influence 
which comes from contact with others of his own age and advancement. The 
committee, therefore, recommends collecting pupils from small schools into larger 
and paying from the public funds for their transportation, believing that in this 
way better teachers can be provided, more rational methods of instruction adopted, 
and at the same time the expense of the schools can be materially lessened. 
4, There is a tendency to fill the rural schools with untrained, immature teach- 
ers. The establishment of normal training schools, under competent instructors, 
with short courses, cach year of which shall be complete in itself, would do much 
to remedy this evil. The extension and adjustment of the courses and terms of 
the State normal schools so as to constitute a continuous session would enable 
them to contribute more directly than now to the improvement of the teachers 
of rural schools (Appendix S$). The State would then be justified in demanding 
some degree of professional training from every teacher in the rural as well as in 
the city schools, 
5. The establishment of libraries, the prosecution of the work of school exten- 
sion by lectures and other means, the introduction of such studies as will havea 
tendency to connect the school and the home, especially those having a direct 
bearing upon the everyday life of the community, and the necessity of applying 
the laws of sanitation to the construction of rural schoolhouses demand imme- 
diate attention.
-P-A-G-E-901
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 821 
6. The rural schools are suffering from the want of official and intelligent super- 
vision. In every State some standard of qualifications, moral. and intellectual 
with some amount of actual experience, should be demanded by law from those. 
who aspire to fill the office of superintendent or supervisor of schools. 
7. Good morals and good manners constitute an essential. part of an educa- 
tional equipment. The inculcation of patriotism, of respect for law and order, 
of whatever tends to make a good citizen, is of as much importance in a small as 
in alarger school. Regularity, punctuality, obedience, industry, self-control, are 
as necessary in the country as in the city school. Country school teachers should 
call to their aid the beautiful things in nature, that with reverential spirit they 
may lead the children to reverence Him who hath made all things good in their 
season. 
Henry Sasin, Chairman. 
REPORT OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCHOOL MAINTENANCE. 
The maintenance of an efficient State system of public instruction involves 
numerous sociological factors of an important character. This is particularly 
true in a democratic State, where public opinion gives the final sanction to all 
public activities. Moreover, there is good reason to think that it is even more 
important to consider such factors carefully when providing rural schvols than 
when providing urban schools. The bearing of the wealth of the State, both in 
the aggregate and in relation to population; the density of population and the 
ratio of rural to urban population; the ratio of the adult or wealth-producing 
population to the population of legal school age; the facilities for travel and the 
character of the people in respect to race elements—the value of such factors as 
these in the problem is almost too plain for argument. . (Appendix A.) 
The organization and administration of the powers of government must also be 
considered. The Government of the United States stands to all the members of 
the Union in the same relation—that is, within the States it has no proper educa- 
tional function whatever. The State government, however, is a constant factor; 
it exercises the central State authority. But when we take the next step we are 
at once confronted by contradiction and confusion. 
First, we find in New England the town system of local government. Here 
nearly all the local governmental functions are performed by the town; the county 
exists, but it is more a judicial than a political unit, and in Rhode Island it is 
wholly judicial. The town is much, the county little. Secondly, the county sys- 
tem, which exists throughout the South and in several of the Western States, 
more than reverses these conditions. The county isthe organ of local government, 
and the township does not commonly exist. The county is divided into districts 
for the purpose of defining the jurisdiction of justices of the peace, into election 
precincts, and sometimes into school townships. Here the county is everything, 
the town nothing. Thirdly, the old Middle States and most of the WesternStates 
have what is called the mixed or compromise system. In these States the town- 
ship is less than in New England and the county more, the county less than in the 
South and the township more; in other words, both township and county are 
employed in something like equal measure. Again, two types of the mixed sys- 
tem are found in different States. In New York and the States that have imi- 
tated her the county legislative and executive board is composed of supervisors 
elected by the several townships, while in Pennsylvania and the States that have 
followed her example this board is composed of commissioners elected by the 
county at large. The county is, therefore, a governmental organ in all the States, 
while the township is found only in two groups of States. Moreover, in those 
States where the town or township is found it varies considerably in powers in 
comparison with the county. These elementary governmental facts it is necessary 
to remember, because they directly affect the matier in hand. Manifestly, the 
people will not be apt to create local organs of government for any one single pur-
-P-A-G-E-902
  822 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
pose unless they deem it absolutely necessary. On the other hand, they will mani- 
festly use for any, such purpose, as far as consistent, the same organs that they use 
for other local purposes. This is just as true of schools and education as of other 
public interests. Except that Vermont has a county examiner of teachers, no 
mention is made of the county in any New England school law;! no mention is 
made of the town or township in any Southern State, while the States that have 
the compromise system use both the county and the township as organs for carrying 
on their schools. It will be seen that no account is here taken of the city or 
municipality, because this is common to all the States and does not relate to rural 
schools. 
An ambiguity in the use of the term town is also to be mentioned. The town- 
ship of the Middle and Western States corresponds in general to the New England 
town, while in these States the town is a village, hamlet, or even city. All the 
recommendations made in this report will recognize distinctly the facts now 
stated. 
Still another preliminary explanation is called for. The term district as used 
in school legislation and in educational discussions is very misleading. The two 
leading senses of the word must be sharply discriminated. This can be done by 
describing the two principal forms of local school organization. 
1. The town or township unit system.—This is something wholly different or 
separate from the town system of local government described above. The two 
systems may exist together, but not of necessity so. The town or township unit 
system, called also the town-district system, is found in connection with both the 
town and the compromise systems of local government. It could not exist with 
the county system, as a matter of course. The town system of local government 
relates to local affairs generally; the town or township district system to schools 
only, The name township-unit system means only that the town or township is 
the ultimate unit of school organization and administration. This unit, with 
such assistance as it receives from the State or county, provides and carries on its 
own schools independent of any other unit. It raises funds by taxation and 
expends them, subject only to the law of the State. It is the organized town or 
township, a body corporate and politic, under its educational aspect. The local 
authority is sometimes a school committee, as in Massachusetts; sometimes a 
board of education, as in Ohio, and again a township trustee, as in Indiana. 
Again, the township-unit system does not necessarily involve the consolidation of 
rural schools. The school children within the unit may all be brought together 
in one central school at some advantageous point, or they may attend a plurality 
of schools scattered through the township. In the second case, the limits or 
boundaries of the several schools must be marked off for the regulation of school 
attendance, unless, indeed, pupils are permitted to attend such schools as they 
please, and these areas are commonly called districts or school districts. In Ohio 
they are known as subdistricts, and they serve also as units of representation in 
the township board.’ Here, then, are two clear uses of the term ‘district ”—one is 
the town or township, and the other a part of the town or township defined pri- 
  
1 Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire once enacted laws creating the county superintend- 
ency, but these laws did not remain long on the statute books. No State is likely to use the 
county for an administrative school purpose unless it uses it for other administrative purposes. 
2 The explanation of the Ohio law on this point is historical. Previous to 1892 the township 
was the school district proper, but this was divided into subdistricts. The township board of 
education raised all the local funds by a tax levied on the taxable property of the township and 
apportioned them among the subdistricts. The subdistrict boards of directors employed the 
teachers and carried on the schools. The voters of the subdistrict, in annual school meeting, 
elected the three directors, one every year, for three years, and these again elected one of their 
number clerk, who represented his subdistrict in the township board. Under the Workman 
law of 1892 all the old powers of the directors were transferred to the township board, but the 
subdistrict was left for the regulation of school attendance and to serve as a unit of representa- 
tion in the township board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-903
ee ee 
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 823 
marily for the regulation of school attendance, but also sometimes serving as a 
unit of representation. 
2. The district system.—Here ‘‘district” is used in quite another sense. Geo- 
graphically the school district is now commonly a subdivision of a town, as in 
Connecticut, or of a township, as in Michigan, or of a county, as in the county- 
system States. Ordinarily it is a body politic and corporate, and is the ultimate 
unit of school organization and administration. It has its own school committee 
or board, elected by the voters of the district in school meeting, and, with such 
help as it receives from the State or county, it builds its own schoolhouse and 
provides and carries on its own school or schools. It is, therefore, a taxing as 
well as an administrative unit. Under this system the district is the controlling 
factor of school organization. Not only is it the most democratic form of school 
organization, but it has been called ‘‘ probably the most communistic as well as 
democratic. feature of our political institutions, and is certainly the smallest 
minor civil division of our system.” ! 
Still other districts are mentioned in the laws and reports, as special districts, 
city districts, borough districts, joint districts, and the like; but these names do 
not present any new features of an essential character. 
These explanations premised, the subcommittee will divide this report into 
three grand divisions, viz, revenue, distribution, and organization. The last 
topic, however, will be considered only so far as relates to school maintenance. 
By school maintenance is meant the provision and support of public schools. 
REVENUE, 
The subcommittee submits that the first essential to the material improvement 
of the rural schools of the country is the provision of revenue sufficient for their 
adequate support. Accordingly this is the first subject to be considered. 
The educational items in the budgets of all progressive countries have assumed 
great proportions and are all the time growing. The Commissioner of Education 
reports the expenditure for common schools in the States of our Union for the 
year 1894-95, not including payments on bonds, at $178,215,556. Seven States 
expended more than $5,000,000 and less than $10,000,000 each, and five more 
than $10,000,000 and less than $20,000,000 each. New York alone stood above 
$20,000,000. In 1888-89 the total for the country was $182,129,000, and in 1883-84 
only $103,909,528. But unfortunately we have no statistics showing the division 
of these vast sums between the rural districts and the towns and cities. 
A city, in the dictionary of the National Census Office, is a concentration of 
population containing 8,000 people or more of all ages, and in 1890 there were 443 
cities in the country. The Commissioner of Education reports for the year 
1893-94 that 3,126,659 children were enrolled in the schools of these cities, to 
10,809,318 enrolled in other schools. He reports further that the maintenance of 
the city schools cost $69,886,413, and of the others $100,497,760. But this is no 
proper division of rural and urban schools, since the educational conditions 
existing in many centers of population containing less than 8,000 people are tho 
same as those existing in the 448 cities. At present it costs much more to school 
1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 children in the cities than in the country, but this is 
mainly due to the fact that the education furnished is so much greater in quan- 
tity and so much better in quality. It is not improbable that if rural schools 
were brought as near as possible to the level of urban schools, they would be 
quite as costly. At least, it is evident that the first condition of good rural 
schools is a sufficiency of funds with which to provide and maintain them. How 
shall these funds be provided?

  824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
I..A century ago the American people began to take an interest in the creation 
of permanent school funds or endowments. This interest was originally stimu- 
lated, if not created, by the policy that Congress foreshadowed in 1785, and sub- 
sequently firmly established, to endow the common schools in the public-land 
States with liberal grants of public lands. In every State in which Congress has 
exploited the wild lands either one-thirty-sixth or one-eighteenth part of such 
lands has been dedicated to the public schools. Beginning with Connecticut in 
1795, nearly all the nonpublic-land States have also created such endowments out 
of their own resources. Several of them devoted the United States deposit fund 
of. 1837 to this purpose. At the beginning of the century no one dreamed to 
what proportions public education would grow in one hundred years; and men 
thought, not unnaturally, that permanent endowments would greatly ease the 
burden of taxation for school purposes, and would keep the educational machin- 
ery of the State constantly running and well regulated. It will not be denied 
that, relatively, these funds have come far short of meeting the expectations of 
those who laid their foundations. There can be little doubt that in many of the 
States, and particularly when such States were new and poor, they have hastened 
educational development; but it is quite certain that they have often done great 
harm, causing the people to rely upon the feeble income derived from them, and 
to turn their faces away from the only adequate source of school maintenance— 
that is, public taxation. 
Texas has been gazetted as having the most magnificent possibilities of any 
State in the way of a permanent school fund, but some citizens of that State are 
now questioning whether these possibilities may not prove other than an unmixed 
blessing (Appendix B). The fact is, public schools in the United States have far 
outgrown all present or prospective endowments. In 1888-89 the income from 
such funds was $9,825,000 in a total of $132,125,111; in 1894-95 the corresponding 
figures were $8,336,612 and $177,597,691; that is, the per cent fell from 7.4 to 4.7 in 
six years. New York and Ohio derive less than $300,000 each of their great school 
revenues from permanent funds, and Pennsylvania derives nothing from such a 
source. In fact, it would require a permanent fund of $400,000,000 to carry on, at 
the present scale of expenditure, the common schools of either New York or Penn- 
sylvania. Thesubcommittee submits, therefore, that all permanent school funds, 
either State or local, should be carefully husbanded and wisely administered; that 
they should be preserved intact, and the income be scrupulously applied to the 
support of schools; that, under special conditions, it may be wise to augment old 
funds or create new ones, as when certain miscellaneous revenues can be devoted 
to that purpose; but that such funds must necessarily play a constantly diminish- 
ing part in popular education. Massachusetts is committed to the policy of add- 
ing to her fund $100,000 a year, raised by taxation, until a total of $5,000,000 shall 
be reached, and New Jersey to the policy of similarly dedicating the proceeds of 
certain riparian rights that belong to the State; and to this there is no objection; 
but for these States, or any others, to lean heavily upon such funds for school 
maintenance would be a most fatuous policy. Public education is, or at least 
should be, a recognized function or service of the State. The public schools of 
the country are civil schools, created and carried on by the civic authority, and 
they must rest ultimately upon the same general means of support as the other 
functions or services of government. As well, therefore, endow any other branch 
or function of the State government, such as the asylums and hospitals, the judi- 
ciary, the civil service, or the militia, as the State schools. 
Il. Gifts to popular education should be sedulously encouraged. Education 
has long been a favorite object with public benefactors, as the annals of every 
progressive country show, and none more convincingly than our own. No doubt 
when the public mind is aroused to the advantages of popular education, and 
school taxes are abundant, such persons who choose an educational object for their
-P-A-G-E-905
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 825 
beneficence will rather be inclined. to seek some other form or kind of education. 
Still the constitution or laws of nearly every State, if not indeed every one, pro- 
vide for the acceptance and use of private gifts for school purposes, and there are 
generous persons who are peculiarly interested in the common schools. Scat- 
tered over the country are many local public-school endowments that had a pri- 
vate origin, and such gifts have not come to an end. 
The subcommittee is not aware that there are any statistics showing how far 
private benevolence contributes to public education, but it is apprised that the 
contribution is by no means contemptible, and it believes that it might be made 
considerably larger than it is. The favorite forms of such contributions under 
existing conditions are most likely to be land for building sites and apparatus 
and libraries for schools, and the subcommittee is of the firm opinion that much 
more could be done than at present in all these directions, and particularly in the 
way of procuring apparatus and books for the schools in communities where the 
public funds that are available for these purposes are meager or insufficient. 
Ill. The great resource of the public school is, and must continue to be, some 
form or forms of public taxation. The ratio of the total school revenues derived 
from taxes to those derived from permanent funds is all the time growing, and it 
will continue to grow. At two periods, separated by six years, the sources of the 
common-school revenues expressed in per cents were as follows:

Manifestly such areas or units of taxation should be created, or continued if 
already in existence, as will fully develop the sound American principle that the 
whole wealth of the State shall be made available for educating all the youth of 
the State. This is both right and necessary, for it must be remembered that in 
the United States education is a civil or State function to be supported like other 
similar functions. What shall these units of taxation be? The subcommittee 
names those following as coming under the principle just stated: 
1. The State.—A liberal provision of funds from the State treasury, to be dis- 
tributed according to some rational method, is indispensable, as a rule, to the 
maintenance of a good system of State schools. Formerly the burden was mainly 
or wholly thrown upon the local units. The old Massachusetts plan was to throw 
upon the towns the whole burden of maintaining their own schools. But the 
greatly increased cost of schools, growing out of enhanced salaries, longer terms, 
and improved material equipment, long ago demonstrated that this plan must be 
materially modified. Many local taxing units are too poor to carry such a load 
and they must either abandon all hope of good schools or they must receive assist- 
ance from the State or social whole. The fact began to gain recognition as early 
as the middle of the century. 
‘When the constitution of Ohio, adopted in 1851, provided that the legislature 
should make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise, as, with the interest aris- 
ing from the permanent school fund, would secure a thorough and efficient sys- 
tem of common schools throughout the State, the law-making power hastened to 
levy upon all the property of the State, as rated by the assessors, a State school 
tax of 2 mills on the dollar, to be distributed on the basis of the school enumera- 
tion. Taking the country together, the cost of public education is divided between 
two or more taxing units. Still the fact remains that the part which falls to the 
local unit is often disproportionate. In 1888-89 the per cent of the total amount 
of school revenues raised by local taxation was 66.8 to19.1 per cent raised by State 
taxation. In 1894-95 the corresponding per cents were 67 and 18.7. The ratio of  
-P-A-G-E-906
  826 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the two elements is variable in different divisions of the Union and in different 
States of the same division. The per cents raised by State tax, as reported, range 
all the way from zero toa maximum of 83.2, found in North Carolina. We should 
naturally expect the Southern States, since local government is there less fully 
developed than at the North, to rely relatively much less on local taxation and much 
more on State taxation, and such is the fact. But political habit is not the only 
factor that enters into the problem; economical conditions also assert themselves 
In a State where wealth abounds and is somewhat evenly distributed throughout 
its limits, as where manufacturing and commercial towns are frequent; there is 
not the same necessity for the State, as a unit, to assume a large proportion of the 
whole burden that there is in a State where wealth is meager, and where such 
wealth as exists is largely found in a few concentrations of population, leaving 
large areas thinly populated and poor. These remarks will throw light on the per 
cents of school moneys raised by State taxation and local taxation in the five divi- 
sions of States that the Census Office recognizes. The date is 1894-95. (See also 
Appendix B.) No account is here taken of income from other sources than 
taxation.

In some of the States, as will be shown hereafter, local taxation must be more 
fully developed than in the past or present; in others, and these principal States, 
too, the same may be said of State taxation. 
2. In all States where, for other local purposes, the county is the sole unit of 
taxation, a liberal county tax should be levied for the schools. This proposition 
applies especially to those States where the county system of local government 
prevails In States where, for such purposes, the county is a large unit of tax- 
ation, it may be wise to levy a county school tax; that circumstances must deter- 
mine. This remark applies to the States having the mixed system of local goy- 
ernment. Under the town system county taxation for schools would be out of 
harmony with the social and political traditions of the people, and could be 
accomplished only through a change of habit; perhaps this end is attainable. For 
the year 1894-95 the Commissioner of Education shows that 67 per cent of the 
total school revenues of the country came from local taxes. The scale ran from 
1.7 per cent in North Carolina to 98.2 in Massachusetts. Unfortunately we have 
no statistics showing from what sources the local taxes come; how much from 
districts, towns, and counties, respectively. The point must, however, be strongly 
pressed that local supply for public education should be forthcoming, as well as 
State supply. It is a great mistake to teach the people to look altogether, or 
mainly, to the State treasury for school maintenance. They should rather be 
taught to depend in due measure upon themselves. It is the confident opinion of 
the subcommittee that some States are now committing this mistake. Many 
States having the county system of local government have in the counties a 
resource for school maintenance upon which they have never adequately drawn. 
8. In those States where the town or township is a large taxing unit for other 
local purposes it should also be made to contribute liberally to public education. 
This recommendation it would be idle to urge in most of the Southern and in 
some of the Western States, because the civil town or township does not exist, 
and it would be vain to urge its creation for school purposes exclusively. But in
-P-A-G-E-907
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 827 
those States where the town and mixed systems of local government exist a town- 
ship school tax would be congruous with the general social and political habits 
of the people. The desirability of local taxation for school purposes was urged 
under the last head. Such taxation develops self-reliance and local character, 
and tends to awaken and keep alive the interest of the people in the schools. The 
town was the sole school taxing unit in old New England, and it is still a promi- 
nent, sometimes almost an exclusive, one throughout the Northern States. The 
local school taxes of New England are town and district taxes, and taken 
together they range from the minimum of 69.2 per cent of the whole in Maine to 
98.2 in Massachusetts. It can hardly be doubted that the New England States, 
as well as some others, now throw the burden too heavily upon the towns and 
districts, and that they will find it advantageous considerably to raise the ratio 
which State taxation bears to local taxation. The other New England States will 
probably follow, sooner or later, the example of Maine, which raises nearly one- 
third of her school money by State taxation. In some States, no doubt, the town- 
ships should carry a heavier weight than at present, at least as compared with 
districts. At all events, the township should bear a reasonable part of the cost of 
its own education. 
4, Special districts, as incorporated villages, towns, and cities, the subcommit- 
tee considers not only proper but necessary units of school taxation. Such dis- 
tricts are the concentrations, large or small, of population and wealth; they are 
the industrial and social centers of the country. We have already seen that in 
1893-94 $69,886,413 was expended for school purposes in the 443 cities of the Union. 
In Massachusetts $7,088,000 was expended in cities; in New York, $12,723,000; in 
Pennsylvania, $7,745,000; in Ohio, $5,097,000; in Illinois, $8,110,000. If we had the 
figures for the smaller cities and the incorporated towns, the aggregate would be 
much increased. Now, not only do the cities, taken together, raise by taxation 
nearly all of the school money that is expended in them, but, as will be shown in 
another place, many of them contribute largely to the support of rural schools. 
Again, they must in the future, collectively as before, contribute still more largely 
to this end. Special districts, then, are essential as taxing units, care being taken 
to secure approximately a fair distribution of the public burdens. As a rule, 
dwellers in cities are much better able to pay heavy taxes than dwellers in the 
country, but there is great reason to fear that they do not always do so. 
The school district, in the commonly accepted sense of that term, is not a desir- 
able taxing unit, but the contrary. It is now such a unit in a majority of States, 
and the subcommittee is decidedly of the opinion that it should either be made 
much less prominent than it is or be abolished altogether. As a rule, the second 
course is to be preferred (except in special districts already mentioned). The 
town or township is the smallest area that should be employed for this purpose. 
Even this may be overweighted, as can easily be shown. The unanswerable objec- 
tions to district taxation are the inequality in burdens that results, and the ina- 
pility of many districts to carry the load that good schools would necessarily 
impose upon them. A few statistics will make both propositions perfectly clear. 
In 1871 Superintendent Fallows, of Wisconsin, published a table showing the 
amount of property assessed per scholar in the school districts of a certain town- 
ship, which he believed to be a type of the state of things generally existing 
throughout that State. The maximum was $2,860; the minimum, $784; the 
average, $1,378. 
In 1878 Superintendent Graham, of the same State, published a table for the 
whole State, showing that the valuation of property per district varied from $2,300 
to $1,979,708. Districts with less than $3,000 and districts with $40,000 were found 
in the same township. But the poor districts were required by law to maintain a 
school six months in the year, just as the rich ones were. The ratio of district 
taxation ranged from half a mill to 55 mills on the dollar. Superintendent Wells,
-P-A-G-E-908
  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of Wisconsin, published similar facts in 1893 for a number of States. He showed 
that in Rhode Island some districts were taxed fourteen times as heavily as others, 
and in Connecticut a similar disproportion existed. In New York the ratio of 
tax raised in two counties varied from 0.0012 per cent in one district to 0.0481 in 
another. One township presented the extremes, 0.0009 and 0.0070, and still another 
one 0.0048 and 0.0371. Two districts in one township paid respectively $5.66 and 
$58.11 per capita; two in another one, $5.43 and $60.37; two in a third, $11.25 and 
$181.85. “That is to say,” says Mr. Wells, ‘‘ the rate of taxation is seven times as 
great in one district as in another in the same town, and the per capita cost of 
educating a child is eleven times as great.”! But the first of these New York 
comparisons presents a ratio of almost 40 to 1. 
Statistics such as these could be collected almost without limit. The most 
instructive way to study the subject is, so to speak, on. the ground. If a man 
unfamiliar with it, who lives under the independent district system, will only 
take the trouble to collect the facts relating to his own county he may easily be 
astonished at the result. And yet, as a rule, the law lays upon the districts, rich 
and poor alike, the same burdens in respect to school maintenance. It is hard to 
see how or why the people have so long borne such inequalities—inequalities so 
contrary to the cherished American principle that the property of the State should 
educate the youth of the State; or, rather, it would be hard to see why they have 
borne them if we did not know the extent of the public ignorance on the sub- 
ject and the strength of conservative habit, and did not see also how the district 
as a taxing unit is bound up in men’s minds with the district as a unit of adminis- 
tration. But the two are not inseparable. The legislature of Ohio abolished the 
district as a taxing unit twenty-five years or more before it abolished the district 
as an administrative unit. In Connecticut, too, town taxes and district manage- 
ment are both met with in the same towns. 
Before dismissing units of school taxation, a single point calls for closer atten- 
tion. This is raised by the question, What is the advantage of looking to large- 
units for supply rather than small ones? 
The answer to this question rests upon the fundamenta! assumption that public 
education is a State function, and that the whole State is responsible for the edu- 
* cation of all the youth of the State. Now, if the cost of public education bore the 
same ratio to the ability of the people to bear this cost in all the communities of 
the State, or, what is nearly the same thing, if the wealth per capita of all the 
communities were equal, then, as a matter of course, it would make no difference 
whether the school tax were levied upon large areas or small ones. But this is 
far from being the case, The cities are indeed concentrations of both absolute 
population and school population, as well as of wealth; but their wealth tends 
to increase much more rapidly than either the absolute or the school population. 
The fortunes of the country are either made in the cities or else tend to flow into 
the cities. The last report of the Census Office shows the per capita wealth of the 
Union, of the States severally, and of the five groups of States, but it does not 
show the per capita wealth of the cities and of the rural districts separately. The 
nearest approach to it is the tables showing the per capita value of real estate with 
improvements, by States and counties. These averages throw important light 
upon the subject, and some examples will be given. 
Illinois: State average, $860.88; highest county average, $1,311.90; lowest county 
average, $164.64. ° 
Massachusetts: State average, $848.01; highest county average, $1,564.10; lowest 
county average, $466.65. 
New York: State average, $969.66; highest county average, $1,783.35; lowest 
county average, $305.80.

-P-A-G-E-909
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 829 
Ohio: State average, $689.01; highest county average, $1,562.56; lowest county 
average, $265.99. 
Pennsylvania: State average, $719.13; highest county average, $1,049.88; lowest 
county average, $187.26. 
If personal property were included, the extremes per capita would be still more 
widely separated than they are at present. Formal argument is not needed to 
show that the rich counties are much more able to contribute to the expense of 
government, education included, than the poor ones, and the proposition that a 
due proportion of such expense should be thrown upon these units rests upon this 
fact. The tendency would be to remove inequalities in bearing the common bur- 
den. Levying the local school tax upon the township instead of the districts that 
compose it, or upon the county instead of the townships, would work in this direc- 
tion. It is very true that townships are unequal in per capita wealth as well as 
districts, and counties as well as townships; still the fact remains that large units 
are less unequal than small ones. Every step toward the highest taxing unit 
tends to distribute the burden more equally. In fact, the argument for removing 
a portion of the burden from the small taxing units to the large ones is the same 
that justifies us in calling upon society to educate individuals or families that are 
too poor to provide for their own education. Why do we impose a public tax for 
educational purposes at all? Simply because education is a common interest, 
while some individuals or families are unable to educate themselves. 
It may be said that the line of reasoning which has been followed would lead to 
placing the whole burden of State education at the door of the State treasury. 
Why should not the State defray the cost of the common schools, just as it defrays 
the cost of the reform schools for boys and girls, and of the asylums and hospitals? 
It must be confessed that this would be strict logic. However, we are to remem- 
ber that governments are never carried on according to strict logic, and can not 
be from the very nature of the case. What is more, there are the best of reasons, 
as shown above, for making education, to a reasonable degree, a local charge— 
reasons that do not apply to some other public services. The people are more likely 
to be vitally interested in the schools if a portion of their cost is derived from 
local taxes. In no country of the world, so far as the subcommittee is aware, is 
elementary education made an exclusive general charge. It is not desirable that 
it should be. The present contention is for a reasonable distribution among the 
several taxing units. At the same time, it may be worth observing that in some 
countries there is a strong tendency, as in England and France, to rely more than 
formerly upon general rather than local supply. 
The appropriations for schools that States make from the common treasury dif- 
fer greatly in form as well asin amount. Massachusetts levies no State school 
tax, but the legislature nevertheless votes various specific appropriations, as for 
the salaries and expenses of State agents, aid to pupils of normal schools, compen- 
sation of local superintendents, the payment of high-school tuition for pupils liy- 
ing in towns whose valuation of property does not exceed $500,000 and that do not 
maintain a high school. Connecticut raises annually a State school tax equal in 
amount to $1.50 multiplied by the number of persons in the State between the ages 
of 4 and 16, as enumerated annually. Rhode Island, while not levying a State 
school tax, so called, votes enough money out of the State treasury each year to 
make, with the income of the permanent fund, a total of $120,000. New York 
raises annually, by taxation based on the real and personal property of the State, 
such sum for the support of schools as the legislature shall determine. New Jer- 
sey assesses and collects a total State tax amounting to $5 for each person in the 
State between the ages of 5 and 18 years. It is this tax that places New Jersey at 
the head of the column of Northern States in respect to the per cent of school 
revenue derived from a State tax. The constitution of Pennsylvania provides that
-P-A-G-E-910
  830 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the State legislature shall appropriate every year $1,000,000 from the ‘State treas- 
ury for the use of schools, but the present appropriation is $5,500,000. 
Ohio levies a tax of 1 mill on the dollar of the grand tax duplicate of the State. 
Indiana raises 11 cents and Kentucky 22 cents on each $100 of taxable property. 
The Michigan law directs the supervisor of every township to levy a school tax of 
1 mill on the dollar for schools within the township, but as the proceeds are kept 
within the districts where they are raised, this is only a compulsory local tax; 
still it stimulates further local taxation for the grand object. The legislature of 
Michigan also levies a specific tax on certain corporations, as railroads, etc., which 
is first applied to the payment of interest on the various educational funds that 
the State has borrowed, as the university, agricultural college, and common- 
school funds, and then to the support of the common schools. Nebraska makes 
an annual levy and assessment not exceeding 14 mills on each dollar’s valuation on 
the grand list of taxable property. The California system of school finance will 
be mentioned under distribution and in an appendix. These are a few of the 
States; still others will be dealt with in connection with distribution. 
The basis of school taxation, or the ultimate sources of school supply, is an 
important subject. Whether more money can be had for the schools often depends 
upon the manner in which it is proposed to levy the tax. In general, taxation for 
schools will conform more or less closely to the character of the State taxing sys- 
tem asa whole. While admitting the great importance of the subject, the sub- 
committee does not feel called upon to discuss beyond offering brief remarks on 
two or three points. 
Pennsylvania meets her annual State school appropriation, in whole or part, by 
laying a tax of 4 mills on the dollar on all moneys loaned by citizens of the State. 
Some States levy poll taxes, and some “occupation” taxes, for their schools. 
Quite miscellaneous sources of school revenue are met with in the State constitu- 
tions and laws. We find specific taxes on dogs, and on banks, railroads, and 
other corporations. Escheats and forfeitures are often, or commonly, devoted to 
the schools. The constitution of Nebraska prescribes that all fines, penalties, and 
licenses arising under the general laws of the State shall belong and be paid over 
to the counties where such fines, etc., may be levied or imposed; also that all fines, 
penalties, and licenses arising under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, 
villages, towns, precincts, or other municipal divisions less than a county shall 
be paid over to the same, respectively; and further, that all these moneys shall be 
appropriated exclusively to the use and support of common schools in the respec- 
tive divisions where the same may accrue. Nor is Nebraska peculiar in so dedi- 
cating such funds. It has been suggested to the subcommittee that an inheritance 
tax would prove a popular as well as an abundant source of school supply. 
DISTRIBUTION, 
The subject of distribution is only less important than that of income. It is 
easy so to distribute school funds as, first, either to defeat, in whole or part, the 
very end sought in taxing the larger units for the benefit of the small ones; or sec- 
ondly, materially to weaken local enterprise and liberality, or wholly to destroy it. 
The subject will be considered under both these aspects. 
1. The assistance that the large political and social units render to the small 
ones, as the State to counties, townships, and districts; or the county totownships 
and districts; or the township to districts, should be made contingent, in part at 
least, upon what the small units do for themselves, Nocommunity, itis believed, 
is so poor that it can not do something toward educating its youth. Again,a 
State educational system should be so organized and administered as to stimulate, 
and not repress, local spirit and effort. It isa great mistake to remove the bur- 
dens of public education so far from the people that they forget, or tend to forget, 
their existence. The principle here involved is a vital one. History shows con-
-P-A-G-E-911
  . REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 831 
clusively that popular education has flourished most in those States of our Union 
where government is most democratic. 
It is difficult, or rather impossible, to lay down a general rule that shall govern 
the division of taxation between the State and the local communities. Two 
things are to beconsidered. Oneis the political institutions that exist in the State. 
If government is largely centralized at State capitals and county seats, that is one 
thing; if it is largely decentralized, as where the principle of local self-govern- 
ment is fully developed, that is quite another. For example, it would be idle to 
expect that the same results would obtain in the Southern States that are found 
in New England, or even in that great group of States where the mixed system of 
local government prevails. The governmental machinery and the traditions of 
the people will assert themselves in such matters. The other factors to be consid- 
ered are social, and particularly economical, conditions. Asremarked early in this 
report, where wealth is abundant and its distribution general and somewhat equal 
in different communities school burdens may be thrown, and should be thrown, 
much more heavily upon localities than where the opposite conditions prevail. 
Density of population, relation of urban to rural population, average wealth per 
capita, ratio of wealth-producing population to the population of legal school age, 
the expenditure for education per pupil and per capita, and the per cent of school 
revenue derived from State taxes and local taxes in the different States, are 
peculiarly interesting when studied together (Appendix A). 
North Carolina shows the largest per cent of State school tax (that is, of the 
whole tax) of any State in the Union, while the average population per square 
mile and the average wealth per capita are also small. Maine surpasses all the 
other New England States in these particulars. The proportionally high ratio of 
State taxation in the South is due to the two facts stated—political institutions 
and economical conditions. But there can be no manner of doubt that, as the 
cities of the South grow, towns multiply, and concentrations of population increase 
in number and in the value of property, local school taxation will materially 
increase. Legislatures could hardly prevent it if they should try, and it would be 
most unwise for them to try to do so. 
2, Funds raised by the large taxing units should be distributed in such a manner 
as to bring the support of the rich and strong to the poor and weak. The only 
reason for taxing these units at all for general purposes is to secure thisend. On 
no other principle can a State school tax, or even a county or township tax, be 
defended, unless, indeed, the county or township is a single school district. The 
practical question is, How shall such funds be distributed so as not to defeat the 
end in view? A historical account of the leading methods actually pursued will 
help on the inquiry. 
The public-land States may be divided into two classes, From the admission 
of Ohio to that of Arkansas (1803-1836) Congress gave to the Congressional town- 
ships of such States, severally, 640 acres of land each for the perpetual use of 
schools, and vested the title in the State legislatures. Accordingly in these States 
every township has its own independent permanent school fund,! which is some- 
times managed by local authorities and is sometimes in the keeping of the State. 
Generally speaking, the sum of the township funds makes the so-called State 
school fund, so far as itis derived from public lands. If the township-unit system 
prevails, the ultimate distribution of income has been made in advance; if the 
district system, then the township distributes to the districts. From the admis- 
sion of Michigan to that of Utah (1837-1895) Congress gave the common-school 
lands to the States as units rather than to townships, which resulted in the estab- 
lishment of consolidated State schoolfunds. The annual income from these funds, 
so far as the subcommittee is informed, is uniformly distributed to the local school 
  
1 Qhio and possibly other States offer some minor exceptions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-912
  832 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
organizations on the basis of the youth of legal school age as enumerated every 
year. The ages vary, but the principle does not change. It should be added that 
since the admission of California (1850) 1,280 acres of common-school lands have 
been given to every Congressional township. 
The rule of apportionment just explained is followed far more generally than 
any other. Thus, Maine distributes her State funds, from whatever source derived, 
to the towns according to the number of children between the ages of 4 and 21. 
Connecticut distributes the annual income of her permaneut fund and the pro- 
ceeds of the tax of $1.50 for every child between the ages of 4 and 16 according 
to the number of children between those ages. Pennsylvania apportions her State 
tax of $5,500,000 annually, Ohio the proceeds of her 1-mill tax, Michigan so much 
of her specific tax as goes to schools, and Indiana and Kentucky the proceeds of 
their State school taxes according to the same general rule. 
But other-rules are followed. Vermont apportions her State tax to the towns, 
cities, and unorganized districts according to the number of legal schools main- 
tained during the preceding school year. New Hampshire distributes her State 
funds to the towns according to the number of pupils returned as attending school 
not less than two weeksin the year. So much of the Massachusetts permanent 
fund as goes directly to the schools is apportioned to the towns of the State that 
have a property valuation of less than $3,000,000, towns ranking above that line 
receiving nothing. Furthermore, the scale is so adjusted that the poorer the town 
the larger the amount that it receives. Towns whose valuation does not exceed 
$500,000 receive $275 each; those exceeding $500,000 and not exceeding $1,000,000" 
receive $200; those exceeding $1,000,000 and not exceeding $2,000,000, $100, and 
those above the last amount and not above $3,000,000, $50. Again, a portion of 
the State fund is divided among the towns that are eligible on the basis of the 
ratio that the town’s school tax bears to the whole town tax ; the larger the ratio 
the more help it receives. Rhode Island distributes her annual State contribution 
of $120,000 as follows: First, $100 is assigned to every school, not exceeding 15 in 
number, in‘a township ; then the remainder is distributed to the towns propor- 
tionally to the number of children from 5 to 15 years of age inclusive. 
The State school moneys of New York are apportioned in a complicated man- 
ner. The State superintendent first sets aside the annual salaries of the school 
commissioners (district superintendents). Next he sets apart to every city, incor- 
porated village having a population of 5,000 and upward, and every union free- 
school district having a like population, which employ a competent superintendent 
of schools, $800; and to cities having more than one member of assembly in the 
State legislature, $500 for each additional member, to be expended according to 
law for the support of the public schools. He then sets apart any money that 
may have been appropriated by the legislature for library purposes, and $6,000 
for a contingent fund. Next he sets aside to the Indians on reservations, for their 
schools, a sum equal to their proportion of the State school money, on the basis of 
distribution established by law. These sumis set aside, the remainder of theState 
moneys is divided into two equal parts. The superintendent now apportions to 
every district in the State $100 (called a ‘‘distributive portion” or ‘district 
quota”), provided it has maintained a school, taught by a single qualified teacher 
or succession of such teachers for the legal term of the preceding school year; and 
the same sum for every additiona) qualified teacher or succession of such teach- 
ers, not counting monitors. The school year is one hundred and sixty days, not 
including holidays that occur during the time or Saturdays. This apportionment 
made, the superintendent divides the remainder of the school moneys among the 
counties according to their respective pepulation as determined by the last pre- 
ceding United States census, excluding Indians on reservations. But cities that 
have special school laws receive their due share separate and apart from the 
remainder of the counties in which they are situated.

  REPORT ON RURAL: SCHOOLS. 833 
The New Jersey State school tax, equal to $5 for each child in the State between 
the ages of 5 and 18, is raised by the several counties according to their amounts 
of taxable property respectively, as shown by the tax rolls of the townships and 
wards of the counties. Ten percent of this tax, when it is paid into the treasury, 
is known asa reserve fund, and is apportioned among the counties by the State 
board of education “equitably and justly, according to their own discretion.” 
The 90 per cent remaining is then divided among the counties in the proportion 
that they have contributed to the tax. When the State school moneys reach the 
counties they, together with all other school funds in the custody of the county, 
are distributed to the townships and cities on the following basis: (1) $200 for 
each teacher employed in the public schools for the full term for which the schools 
are maintained during the year next preceding (nine months); (2) the remainder 
according to the last published school census (children from 5 to 18 years of age), 
provided that no district shall receive less than $275, and that districts with 55 
children or more shall not receive less than $375. If these funds are not suffi- 
cient to maintain a free school nine months in the year, then the inhabitants 
may raise by a district tax such additional amount as is needed for that purpose. 
The local 1-mill tax levied by Minnesota is expended within the districts where 
itis raised. It is, therefore, only a compulsory district tax, the same as in Mich- 
igan. The current school fund of the same State, which includes the income of 
the permanent fund, is distributed on the basis of the number of pupils who have 
attended school forty days or more in districts that have had school for five months 
or more during the year. In addition to the above apportionment, graded schools 
having not less than three departments, which come up to certain requirements, 
receive aid from the State to the amount of $200 each. Besides,*there are 85 
high schools that receive State aid to the amount of $400 each. The grants to 
these graded schools and high schools are paid from permanent appropriations that 
are met by general taxation, and are apportioned by the State high-school board, 
on evidence that the schools are complying with the requirements. Minnesota 
also gives the sum of $500 annually to State high schools providing elementary 
normal instruction of a kind that satisfies the high-school board. Wisconsin also 
has an approved high-school list, one-half the cost of maintaining these schools 
being paid from the State treasury. Moreover, Wisconsin pays $250 each to cer- 
tain approved high schools in which manual training is taught. 
The California system of school finance is a uniquesystem. The State superin- 
tendent apportions to the counties the State school fund according to their respec- 
tive numbers of school-census children (from 5 to 17, certain classes being 
excluded). Each county superintendent first ascertains the number of teachers 
every district in the county is entitled to on the basis of one teacher for every 70 
school-census children, or fraction thereof not less than 20, as shown by the next 
preceding school census, and then the number to which the county is entitled by 
adding these district numbers together. He then calculates the amount of money 
to be raised at the legal rate of $500.a teacher. From this amount he deducts the 
quota of the State fund assigned to the county, and the remainder is the minimum 
amount of the county school fund to be raised by taxation for the ensuing year, 
provided that the minimum of such fund shall not be less than $6 for every cen- 
sus child. The county fund thus made up is then distributed to the districts in 
accordance with this rule, viz, $500 for every teacher, except (1) that to districts 
having less than 20 census children only $400 is assigned, and (2) that to districts 
having more than 70 census children $20 additional for every such child less than 
20 in number shall be allowed. All school moneys remaining in the treasury after 
this apportionment has been made are then divided among the districts of the 
county in proportion to the average daily attendance upon each district during 
the preceding school year. District taxes may also be raised, subject to certain 
legal conditions (Appendix C).

  834 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The subcommittee does not feel called upon to deal with all the States, or even 
with all the peculiar modes of distributing school moneys. It believes that the 
enumeration of particulars now made is ample for the present purpose. Some 
remarks upon the leading rules or methods of distribution are, however, called for. 
1. Distribution according to the school census or enumeration is open to a serious 
objection, viz, it does not carry the money where it is most needed. For example, 
two districts lie side by side, one having 20 and the other 40 youths of school age; 
the second district draws twice as much money as the other, but the cost of keep- 
ing up the two schools is practically the same. The same would be true of two 
township units, unless the schools were consolidated. The result is that the dis- 
trict or township that needs the most help receives the least. The rule is simple 
and easily worked, but it tends partially to defeat the end of State or county aid. 
2, The same objection holds against rules based on the school enrollment or on 
attendance, only with somewhat diminished force. Again, if the enrollment is 
followed, or attendance for a brief time, there is danger that some children will 
go to school long enough to be counted, and then drop out. Besides, such rules of 
distribution work in favor of the graded schools and against the rural schools, on 
account of their larger enrollment and more regular attendance. 
8. Taking everything into account, the subcommittee is inclined to think that 
a fixed sum or sums, based on an arbitrary unit or units, is most equitable. 
Examples of such rules are furnished by the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
New York, New Jersey, and California. The most serious objection to such rules 
is that they are necessarily complicated; some of those given above are quite com- 
plicated. Then, if the fixed sum is so much a teacher, as in New York, orso much 
a district, as in Rhode Island and New Jersey, there is a temptation to the undue 
multiplication of schools or teachers. But this point can besafeguarded by fixing 
statutory limitations, as in California. No rule can be devised that will not be 
open to objection. The subcommittee does not believe it possible to invent any 
rule of distribution that will well accomplish the purpose of taxing large units for 
the benefit of small ones, unless it rests on the school or the teacher as a unit 
with the necessary qualifications. The Massachusetts rule is open to the objection 
that the school needs of towns can not always be measured by low valuations of 
property assessed for taxation, as the number of pupils to be educated is also a 
factor. If the method of distribution now recommended is objected to as an 
exclusive one, then it may be supplemented by basing a part of the appropriation 
on the school census, enrollment, or attendance. The resort to the United States 
census is most objectionable, as great changes of population occur in the course of 
ten years. 
The difference in the working of the school-census method and the fixed-sum 
method of distribution is well shown by comparing the statistics of two States. 
For the fiscal year ending November 15, 1895, the mill tax of Ohio produced 
$1,720,922. Of the 88 counties 40 paid more into the fund than they received from 
it, while 48 paid less than they received. Some of the major counties of the State 
received more from the fund than they paid into it, while minor counties paid 
more than they received. For the year 1896 the city of Cleveland actually received 
$2,616.67 more from the State than it paid to the State. Assuredly, a rule that 
makes the agricultural counties of Ohio, or many of them, contribute to the edu- 
cation of Cleveland, the most populous city in the State, is a travesty of common 
sense, 
But the same year Cincinnati paid in round numbers $70,000 more than it received. 
This is hardly better than repealing the mill tax outright, and letting the burden 
of education fall directly upon the cities and townships. On the other hand, the 
State of New York, in 1896, paid a total general school tax of $4,062,903, of which 
$3,500,000 was immediately distributed to the counties again. Fifty-four of the 
60 counties received more from this tax than they contributed to it; only 6
-P-A-G-E-915
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 835 
counties paid more than they received. Erie County paid $241,597 and received 
$185,460; while the corresponding figures for Kings and New York counties were 
$503,603 and $387,879, and $1,884,584 and $636,133, respectively. The New York 
rule does bring the strong to the help of the weak. 
A question arises in respect to separate funds for buildings, the payment of 
teachers, and incidental expenses. In the opinion of the subcommittee such divi- 
sion is desirable. The need of providing new buildings is often made an excuse 
by boards of education for keeping down the salaries of teachers. The triple fund 
would not indeed prevent such injustice, which makes teachers as such contribute 
to buildings, but it would tend in that direction. It is often stipulated in school 
laws that State funds apportioned to communities shall be wholly applied to the 
payment of teachers. This is a wholesome regulation. The cost of grounds, 
buildings, and incidental expenses should be met by local taxes or other local 
funds. Touching the division of the cost of public education, State Superintend- 
ent Stetson, of Maine, in a private communication, thus defines the prospective 
policy of that State: ‘Local communities shall provide school lots and school 
buildings, and keep the same in repair. Two-thirds of the money raised for main- 
taining schoolsshall come from the State and one-third from the local communities. 
The apportionment of the money to the several municipalities shall be upon the 
basis of average attendance. We shall also try to get a law prohibiting towns 
from receiving State aid, if they maintain schools having less than a certain aver- 
age attendance.” Such a law as this would serve to prevent the undue multipli- 
cation of districts, and would even work a certain measure of consolidation. 
The distribution of taxes levied on railroads, telegraphs, long-distance telephone 
lines, express companies, and the like, is an important question. In some States, 
as New York, Texas, and Ohio, school taxes levied on railroads inure to the exclu- 
sive benefit of the districts or townships through which the tracks run, excluding 
any State tax that may be levied on such property. This rule the subcommittee 
regards as unjust. The location of railroads is determined largely by physical 
conditions, and the mere fact that a line happens to run through its territory, 
where probably not a dollar of the stock or bonds is owned, is no reason why a 
district or township should profit thereby to the exclusion of other and less for- 
tunate districts or townships. 
In Pennsylvania the taxes on railroads are paid into the State treasury and are 
distributed by the legislature along with other revenues, the public schools, nor- 
mal schools, and colleges being included among the objects of the appropriation. 
California has a.similar provision. The mode of distributing the Michigan spe- 
cific tax has already been described. It is believed that such revenues as the fore- 
going should inure to the common benefit of the State; but what is here said, let 
it be remarked, in no way relates to pending controversies about the taxation of 
railroads or other:similar property. 
The Nebraska law contains one excellent feature that is worthy of mention. 
All public high schools in the State that, as determined by the State department 
of education, have aproper equipment of teachers, appliances, and course of study, 
are open to attendance by any person of school age residing outside the district 
who is a resident of the State and whose education can not be profitably carried on 
in the public school of the district of his residence. Such pupil must have a cer- 
tificate signed by the county superintendent that he has completed the common- 
school course prescribed by the State department for work below the high school. 
He must attend at the high school nearest to his residence or at a high school of 
approved grade in the county of his residence. Any school board that fur- 
nishes high-school instruction to such pupil isauthorized to charge 50 centsa week 
for the time that he has been in attendance, and it is made the duty of the county 
board to pay all such bills out of the county school fund. Massachusetts and 
Ohio, and perhaps other States also, provide for educating qualified pupils in high
-P-A-G-E-916
  836 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
schools in other p.aces than those where they reside, provided there are no home 
schools for them to attend, and this without cost to themselves. As Massachusetts 
is the only State that makes the provision of high schools compulsory under any 
circumstances, it may be well to mention the principal features of the State law 
in regard to that subject. Every town having a population of 4,000 persons or 500 
families is obliged to maintain a high school, the grade of the school depending 
somewhat upon the fact whether it has the larger or the smaller population. 
Pupils living in towns that are not required to maintain a high school can attend 
any neighboring high school that will receive them. In such cases the State pays 
the tuition of the pupil, provided the valuation of the town in which he resides 
does not exceed $500,000; if the valuation does exceed that amount the town pays 
the tuition. High-school tuition is, therefore, wholly free to every qualified pupil 
in the State. 
ORGANIZATION, 
The subcommittee is not here interested in the subject of school organization 
further than it relates to school maintenance. Its relations to teaching, super- 
vision, and studies are topics belonging to other divisions of the general report. 
The statement and enforcement of two propositions will answer the present 
purpose. 
I. The first proposition is that the township-unit system is far superior to the 
district system, and should be substituted, if practicable, for that system wherever 
itexists. The superiority of the town or township as an administrative unit is as 
great as its superiority as a taxing unit. The principal advantages are the 
following: 
1. If the schools of a township are under a single board elected from the town- 
ship at large, schoolhouses will far more likely be built where they are needed 
than under the other system. 
2. Equality of school provision will be much more fully secured in respect to 
schoolhouses and grounds, length of school terms, and the ability and character of 
teachers. 
8. The tendency will not be to multiply schools unduly, but to restrict their 
number, bringing together more scholars, and thus making better classification, 
grading, and teaching possible, and increasing the interest and enthusiasm of the 
pupils. 
4, Better supervision can be secured. The county superintendent can deal more 
effectively and easily with one-board in a township than with six, ten, or twelve; 
while township and township-union supervision will be greatly promoted. 
5. Simplicity and economy of administration will be facilitated, and the sense 
of official responsibility be enhanced. 
6. The tendency will be to employ teachers for longer terms, and thereby to 
restrict, in a considerable degree, the evils that flow from frequent changes. On 
this point the statistics of Mr. Gass, presented in this report, may be mentioned. 
7. The strifes and contentions between districts that are now not infrequent 
will be prevented. 
8. Transfers of pupils from school to school will be made more easy. 
9, The reason last to be mentioned is perhaps the strongest of all. The rela- 
tions of the township-unit system to school consolidation have already been sug- 
gested. Tho township system does not necessitate such consolidation, although 
it is likely to work that way; but consolidation is almost wholly dependent upon 
that system; schools will not be consolidated in great numbers if a plurality of 
district school boards have to do the work. 
The subcommittee has stated that the adoption of the township-unit system 
will be followed by the reforms that have been mentioned. It is not, indeed, 
meant that such will be the unvarying result. There will be exceptions—perhaps
-P-A-G-E-917
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 837 
many exceptions—when the whole country is considered, but the tendency will be 
strong in the directions named, or such will be the general character of the result. 
Not only is this the suggestion of common sense, but it is the teaching of experi- 
ence as well. (Appendix E.) 
The town-unit school system was the ancient system of New England. The 
classic-school law enacted by the general court of Massachusetts in 1648 ordered 
that the towns should found schools on their reaching a certain number of house- 
holders, the teachers to be paid either by the parents of such children as resorted 
to them for instruction or by the inhabitants in general by way of supply, as those 
who ordered the prudentials of the town should appoint. The word “township” 
is also used in thelaw. Connecticut followed the example of Massachusetts. The 
original New England town, which was a small concentration of population, was 
well adapted to this system. But ‘‘as the population of each little nucleus of 
settlement spread itself out from the center of the original ‘plantation,’ it early 
became convenient, in Massachusetts and Connecticut at least, to allow neighbor- 
ing families at a distance from the local concentration, or nucleus, to form them- 
selves into a school district.” The original church parishes were divided in the 
same way. If these districts had been founded merely for the purpose of school 
supply, or to regulate attendance, there would have been, under the conditions 
existing, no objection to their formation, but the contrary. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, these new districts also became units of school maintenance, bodies corporate 
and politic. These districts appear at first to have existed by sufferance merely, 
put the celebrated school law of 1789 legalized them, thus paving the way for the 
general introduction of the new system. Horace Mann declared in his Tenth 
Annual Report: ‘‘I consider the law of 1789 * * authorizing towns to divide 
themselves into districts the most unfortunate law on the subject of common 
schools ever enacted in the State.” Still this “act was not repealed until manu- 
facturing had restored those concentrations of population which in the early col- 
onies had invited township control of school affairs.” This was finally done. Mr. 
Mann in the same report (p. 37) bore this testimony to the superiority of the town 
system: 
As a general fact, the schools of undistricted towns are greatly superior to those 
in districted towns—and for obvious reasons. The first class of towns—the undis- 
tricted—provide all the schoolhouses, and, through the agency of the school 
committee, employ all the teachers. If one good schoolhouse is provided for any 
section of the town, all the other sections, having contributed their respective 
portions of the expense to erect the good house, will demand one equally good for 
themselves; and the equity of such a demand is so obvious that it can not be 
resisted. If, on the other hand, each section were a separate district, and bound 
for the whole expense of a new house if it should erect one, it would be tempted 
to continue an old house long after it had ceased to be comfortable, and, indeed, 
as experience has too often sadly proved, long after it has ceased to be tenantable. 
So, too, in undistricted towns we never see the painful, antirepublican contrast 
of one school in one section kept all the year round by a teacher who receives $100 
amonth, while inanother section of the same town the school is kept on the mini- 
mum principle, both as to time and price, and, of course, yielding only a minimum 
amount of benefit, to say nothing of probable and irremediable evils that it may 
inflict. In regard to supervision, also, if the school committee is responsible for the 
condition of all the schools, it is constrained to visit all alike, to care for all alike, 
and, as far as possible, to aim in all at the production of equal results, because 
any partiality or favoritism will be rebuked at the ballot box. In undistricted 
towns, therefore, three grand conditions of a prosperous school, viz, a good house, 
a good teacher, and vigilant superintendence, are secured by motives which do 
not operate, or operate to a very limited extent, in districted towns. Under the 
nondistricting system it is obvious that each section of a town will demand at 
least an equal degree of accommodation in the house. of talent in the teacher, and of 
attention in the committee; and should any selfish feelings be indulged it is some 
consolation to reflect that they, too, will be harnessed to the car of improvement. 
The district system was at one time universal, and it exists in some form in a 
great majority of the States to-day. In Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
-P-A-G-E-918
  
  838 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
and New Jersey it has been wholly swept away. In Connecticut and Rhode 
Island the town system is permissive and exists side by side with the district sys- 
tem. The township system exists in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. It is 
permissive in the upper peninsula of Michigan, in Wisconsin, and in Minnesota, 
and doubtless in other States. It varies somewhat in the organization of the local 
authority. The Massachusetts school committee consists of three members, or a 
multiple of three, elected from the town at large. In New Jersey the board con- 
sists of three, five, or nine members, as the town may elect. The Ohio board 
consists of delegates or representatives elected by the subdistricts, one each. A 
single trustee elected by the people manages the schools of a township in Indiana, 
except that he is assisted by a director in each attendance district who looks after 
incidental local matters. 
Considering the great superiority of the township system over the district sys- 
tem, it is not a little strange that its introduction in the room of its competitor 
should have been so steadily resisted as it has been. This opposition is due in 
part to the power of conservative habit, in part to the belief that the district 
system is more democratic, and in part to the popular fondness for office holding, 
all conjoined with much misconception and ignorance in respect to the merits of 
the two systems. It has also been urged in favor of the district by politicians that 
it is the best unit for canvassing the States for political purposes. Certainly it 
can not be objected to the township system in its pure form that it is not suffi- 
ciently democratic. In 1875 there were 15,087 teachers employed in teaching the 
common schools in Ohio, and there were in the State at the same time more than 
85,000 school directors and members of boards of education charged with the 
administration of the schools. This, assuredly, is an excess of democracy. 
The ‘‘community” system is much worse than the district system, and fortu- 
nately it is confined to a single State. The Texas law permits parents, guardians, 
or other persons having control of children of scholastic age, residing in any one 
of the so-called ‘‘community” counties (35 in number out of a total of 250), 
to unite and organize themselves into a free-school community entitled to the 
benefits of the available school fund belonging to the county, upon complying 
with certain prescribed conditions. The persons so uniting and organizing first 
address a petition to the county judge, who is ex-officio county superintendent of 
schools, duly signed by the petitioners, setting forth that the community is white 
or black, as the case may be, giving an alphabetical list of the names of children 
of scholastic age within the limits proposed, describing the capacity of the school- 
house and the character of the other conveniences that the petitioners have to 
offer, naming persons to act as trustees, etc. The matter then passes into the 
hands of the judge, who has no discretionary power in the premises. He may not 
even throw aside such a petition either because it is signed by few persons or 
because the alphabetical list carries few names. The law does not fix any mini- 
mum number in either case. If the people of a neighborhood desire a school, no 
matter how few they may be, a school the judge must grant them. The ‘“ com- 
munity” is a voluntary district in the strict sense of the term, having legal exist- 
ence for one year only, and having no authority to levy a local school tax, and the 
evils that attend it are far greater than those that call so loudly for the abolition 
of the district system wherever that is practicable. The people of Texas can, 
however, congratulate themselves that the ‘“‘community” school, which plainly 
originated in pioneer society, has lost ground in later years. 
In the South, and in those Western States that have the county system of local 
government, the only practical alternative to the district system of school organ- 
ization is a county system. It must be remembered that in these States the town 
or township does not exist. Fortunately,such a system is not altogether unknown. 
In a few counties of Georgia it has been in successful operation for a number of
-P-A-G-E-919
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 839 
years. These are the principal features of the system as it exists in Richmond 
County, in which the city of Augusta is situated: 
The county is the unit area of organization, and the rural parts and the urban 
parts of the county district, as far as practicable, are treated just alike. A board 
of education, composed of representatives elected by the people of the county for 
the term of three years, one-third retiring each year, managesall theschools. The 
school tax is levied at a uniform rate upon all the property of the county, without 
revision by any other authority and without any limit as to.rate or amount. The 
county and State funds are distributed to the schools according to the number of 
children to be educated. There is no district tax. The same qualifications are 
required for country and for city teachers. The teachers are treated as nearly 
alike as the conditions admit, and they are paid about the same salaries. The 
schools are in session the same length of time in a year, nine calendar months. 
The country schoolhouses, on the average, are situated 4 miles apart, and no child 
is out of walking distance of a school open nine months in the year, and taught by 
a good teacher. One superintendent has charge of all the schools. Augusta has 
nine-tenths of the taxable property of the county, but only three-fourths of the 
school population. In other words, the rural parts of the county pay one-tenth of 
the school tax and receive the benefit of one-fourth of it. For the most part, these 
are excellent provisions. The county would seem to be the natural area unit for 
popular schools under the county system of local government. The subcommittee 
confidently believes that this mode of school organization has a great future before 
it in the United States (Appendix D). 
II. In those parts of the country where existing physical and social conditions 
render it practicable there should be such a consolidation of rural schools as will 
diminish the existing number of schools, schoolhouses, and teachers, and bring 
together, at advantageous points, the pupils who are now divided and scattered 
among the isolated schools of the township or other similar district. This step 
should be taken in the interest of good education as well as of public economy. 
To make this reform possible, the children, as far as may be necessary or prac- 
ticable, must be conveyed to and from the schoolhouses at public expense. 
How absolutely fatal to good schools the existing conditions are in many parts 
of the country, statistics show most conclusively. State Superintendent Wells, of 
Wisconsin, reported in 1894 that his State had 183 districts whose average attend- 
ance the previous year was not more than 5 each; that 858 others were not above 
10 each; while 2,481 more did not exceed 20 each. ‘‘In other words,” he said, 
“3,522 country districts, about three-fifths of the total number, have an average 
attendance not exceeding 20, and about two-fifths above that average, with the 
great majority near the lower margin.”! 
Mr. H. R. Gass, of Michigan, citing the State report for his authority, states in 
a published paper that in 1886 the country schools of Calhoun County in that 
State required 158 teachers, and that they employed 342 different ones in the course 
of the year. The average length of the school in the district was 8.4 months, 
while the average term for which the teachers were employed was but3.8 months. 
He cites a second county that presents like statistics, and then observes: ‘‘ The 
ratio of the number [of teachers] required to the number employed is about the 
same as this throughout the State, the tenure being longer in the newer than in the 
older counties.” This state of things Mr. Gass attributes to the prevalence of the 
districtsystem! He refersto Massachusetts and Indiana, where changes of teachers 
are much less frequent and teachers’ tenures much longer than in Michigan. 
While two teachers on an average were employed in Michigan for a school every 
year, but few schools in the other States employed more than one. In the same 
State at the present time there are over 1,000 districts that enumerate less than 25

  840 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
children of school age each, while 70 counties contain 468 districts that enumerate 
less than 15 each. The statistics at hand do not show the actual size of the schools. 
Nor are the small schools found in the newer and poorer parts of the State only; 
the oldest and richest counties have their fair share of them. In fact, the newer 
parts of a State often have the largest and best schools. Not only so, the oldest 
and most densely populated States frequently make a very poor showing. In 
1894-95 there were 7,529 school districts in New York, in each of which the aver- 
age attendance upon school during the year varied from 1 to 20 pupils, while the 
average daily attendance in each of 2,983 districts was less than 10 pupils (Appen- 
dix I). In 1893 Vermont had 153 schools of 6 pupils or less each. In 1892 State 
Superintendent Luce, of Maine, reported that the average enrollment in the 
schools of that State for the previous year was less than 25 pupils to a school, and 
that the number of districts having less than 25 was larger than the number hay- 
ing more. He declared that there were probably between 1,000 and 1,200 existing 
schools in the State whose enrollment was 12 or less, and that 600 or 800 schools 
then existing could be abolished without detriment.!. Twenty-five years ago a 
large number of schools on the Western Reserve, Ohiv, long famed for schools, 
had dwindled to the most insignificant size. Still other statistics of similar im- 
port will be found in the report of the subcommittee on instruction and dis- 
cipline. Attention is drawn particularly to those relating to Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts. 
But it is needless to multiply statistics or to insist at length that thousands of 
rural schools furnish their pupils with a miserable preparation for the duties of 
life. When we consider the various elements that enter into good education, and 
especially training for social activities, it is not too much to say that a very small 
school is almost necessarily a very poor school. The facts are notorious. Hitherto 
it has been supposed that, although the cities and towns surpassed the rural dis- 
tricts in higher education, the rural districts contained a smaller proportion of 
illiterate persons. This has been the prevailing view in the Northern States, and 
probably it was once in accord with the facts. The cities have been considered 
the great hives of illiteracy. But there is now grave reason to question whether 
the fact is not often the other way. Certainly it is so in the only State where, so 
far as the subcommittee is informed, the subject has been statistically investi- 
gated.? But however this may be, a remedy for the unsatisfactory state of the 
rural schools is one of the pressing needs of the day. Whatcan be done? One 
thing that can be done is to consolidate many of the small schools by carrying 
back and forth such pupils as need to be carried, and thus, by one stroke, create 
several of the conditions of good schools. The interest that this subject is begin- 
ning to awaken is one of the hopefui signs of the times. 
  
1 Quoted by Mr. Gass. See ‘‘ Transactions of the Michigan State Teachers’ Association, 1887.” 
2The State referred tois Michigan. According to the State census of 1894 the ratios of the 
foreign-born persons in the cities of the State, 10 years of age or more, unable to read and write, 
and in the State at large, were practically the same, 84in 1,000. But the ratios of the native-born 
in the cities, in the State at large, and therefore in the country districts, were quite different. 
In the cities it was 14 in 1,000; in the State at large, 21 in 1,000; in the country, 24 in 1,000. For 
every 14 persons 10 years of age or upward in the cities unable to read and write there were 24 
in the country; that is, the ratio in the country is 70 per cent greater than that in the cities. If 
the country rate of illiteracy could be reduced to the city rate, thenumber of illiterates of the 
native-born population 10 years of age and upward unable to read and write would be reduced 
about 8,000. Several facts, no doubt, enter into the explanation of the greater illiteracy of the 
country districts, but the most important of them is the inferiority of the country schools. It 
does not explain matters to say that Michigan is comparatively a new State: that much of it is 
thinly settled; that it contains large lumbering-and mining districts, etc. The fact is that in the 
oldest and wealthiest parts of Michigan the cities, as a rule, surpass the counties in which they 
are situated in respect to popular intelligence. The city of Detroit ranks distinctly higher than 
Wayne County, and the same may be said of the cities of Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor as com- 
pared with Kent and Washtenaw counties. The counties named contain the cities mentioned.

  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 841 
It was Massachusetts that led the way in developing the district system, and it 
is Massachusetts that is leading the way in consolidation. An act that dates from 
1869 authorizes any town in the Commonwealth to raise money by taxation to 
enable the school committee, in its discretion, to provide for the conveyance of 
pupils to and from the public schools at public cost. The towns were already 
empowered to build schoolhouses wherever they were really needed. Availing 
themselves of these powers, many towns have entered upon the work of consoli- 
dating their schools. How the work goes on is shown by the following table 
exhibiting the sums of money paid for public-school transportation for a series of 
years: 
  
Year. Amount. | Year. Amount. 
  
    
The movement has extended beyond Massachusetts and reached every one of the 
New England States. In these States many hundreds of schools have been con- 
solidated, and with the most gratifying results. Occasionally an unsuccessful 
experiment is reported, but the great stream of testimony runs strongly the other 
way. Longer school terms, better teachers, better grading, better instruction, 
more interest in the pupils, greater physical comfort on the part of the children, 
better supervision—these are the claims that are made for the new departure 
(Appendixes E and F). Other things being equal, the new way is never more 
expensive than the old one, and often it is less expensive. 
The movement has spread beyond New England. In 1894 a law was enacted in 
New Jersey providing for the transportation of pupils at public expense in order 
that rural schools might be consolidated with city ones. A most interesting 
experiment in consolidation is being tried in northeastern Ohio, where some 
schools had already died out and many more were lingering on the verge of death. 
Permissive legislation has been obtained in several counties, and already many 
townships are working the plan successfully, while many others are looking on 
expectantly and are apparently on the point of making the new departure. The 
newspapers are quick to note the innovation, and itis already attracting attention 
beyond the borders of the State (Appendix F). 
The distinct pedagogical advantages of consolidation are much more fully set 
forth in the reports on supply of teachers and instruction and discipline than here. 
In this.report the topic is dealt with mainly as it is related to organization and 
administration. The fact is, however, the several aspects of consolidation are 
inseparably connected. As a rule, whatever promotes simplicity and ease of 
administration promotes good instruction, and vice versa. No one of the sub- 
committees that handle the subject for a moment supposes that there is any charm 
in the word “consolidation” to cast all the evil spirits out of the rural school, but 
they all believe, after giving the subject mature consideration, that great possibil- 
ities of improvement lie in that direction. It is perfectly true that the consolida- 
tion remedy can not be universally applied, because physical and social conditions 
often forbid. The fact is that a large proportion of the children of the land will 
be schooled in little schools—rural schools, ungraded schools—or they will not be 
schooled at all. Suggestions looking to the improvement of these schools will be 
found in the reports of all the subcommittees, but insistence is here placed upon 
the fact that the consolidation remedy can be applied on a grand scale, with the 
largest promise of success. 
In most States some new legislation will be necessary to that end, but not in all.
-P-A-G-E-922
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Wherever the township-unit system exists, the first step, and the long step, has 
already been taken. In such States it should not be difficult to secure the needed 
legislation in relation to transportation. State Superintendent Emery, of Wis- 
consin, has already notified the people of his State that the laws contain all the 
provisions that are necessary to enable them to move at once in the direction of 
school consolidation. 
It is important that the consolidation reform shall not be misunderstood. It 
does not necessarily mean that there shall be only one school in a town or town- 
ship. It does not mean either that parts of different townships or counties shall 
not be comprised in one school. These questions are merely matters of detail, and 
their adjustment will depend upon such factors as the size of townships, the dis- 
tribution of villages or other local centers, the direction and condition of roads, 
streams, and bridges, the distribution of population, and the physical configura- 
tion of the township and the adjacent parts of the country. 
It is noteworthy how the different phases of educational reform all tend to hold 
together. In the Northern States the cause of schvol consolidation depends inti- 
mately upon the adoption of the township-unit system. A certain amount of 
consolidation can be effected by the abolition of small districts; it may be possible, 
also, for several independent districts to merge their schools into one, for the time 
at least, and still preserve their independence; but it is manifest that the first plan 
will not prove effectual and that the second one will be infrequent and precarious. 
The subcommittee believes confidently, therefore, that the fortune of effectual 
consolidation is closely bound up with the fortune of the township-unit system. 
It is also noteworthy, let it be remarked again, how different social elements 
tend to attract one another and so to coalesce. School consolidation, especially 
its practicability, turns largely upon means of cheap, safe, and easy communica- 
tion throughout the school area. Here we touch a question intimately relating to 
social progress that has been receiving increasing attention the last few years. 
Reference is made to the improvement of roads. Those who have been promoting 
this movement have not probably regarded it as a measure of educational reform; 
but such itis. Perhaps there is no rural interest of a social nature that would be 
more decidedly enhanced by good roads than the educational interest. The people 
of some of the towns of Ohio, where the new plan is being tried, claim this asa 
decided advantage, that the drivers of the omnibuses serve as carriers for the 
mails between the farmhouses and the post-offices, thus promoting the diffusion 
of intelligence in still another way. 
Only a single point remains to be pressed, but it must be pressed strongly. This 
is the necessity of lengthening materially the time that the country schools on the 
average are in session each year and the securing of a more regular attendance of 
the pupils. The legal years now vary widely in different States, and the practical 
or real years still more widely. Some communities always surpass the legal mrin- 
imum of time, others as regularly fall below it. In the thickly settled States of 
the East the rural schools are in session eight, nine, or ten months in the year; 
but often in the South, and sometimes in the West, one-half the shortest of these 
terms is not reached. The legal year is frequently absurdly short. Until two 
years ago the Michigan year was but three months, and now it is but five months. 
It is quite unnecessary to argue that short schools are, evenly relatively, poor 
schools. In order to have a good school it is necessary not only to bring pupils 
together in considerable numbers, but also to hold them to the work a certain 
number of hours each day and a certain number of days each year. There must 
be a concentration of effort as of pupils. It is as wasteful a method of education 
to send children to school seventy or eighty days in the year as it is to send them 
two or three hours in the day. Persons interested in popular education, and par- 
ticularly in rural education, should not rest therefore in their efforts until they
-P-A-G-E-923
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 843 
have made the legal school year in every State at least one hundred and sixty or 
one hundred and eighty days. 
But it will not be enough for the State simply to fix a minimum school year; it 
must see to the enforcement of the law. The law should hold communities to a 
rigid accountability in respect to maintaining schools of legal grade for the full 
legal periods, to employing none but certificated teachers, and making all the 
required reports to the State educational department. Most school laws contain 
such provisions as these, but it is feared that they are not always enforced. The 
only practicable mode of enforcement is absolutely to withhold from the local 
organizations all aid from the superior taxing units, as the State, until they first 
observe the law. 
And again, it will not suffice for the State to see that the prescribed quality of 
instruction is actually furnished. It might perhaps be thought that if the State 
only provided local schools and made them free the people would be only too glad 
to avail themselves of them to the full, but sad experience shows that this is not 
always thecase. The indifference, ignorance, and selfishness of some parents come 
between their children and the schools. In communities where the school attend- 
ance is compulsory some parents are in an almost constant battle with the author- 
ities to keep their children out of the school as much as possible. It is possible 
that such extreme indifference or selfishness as this is more common in cities than 
in the country; and yet it is true, as a rule, that the country child’s labor, espe- 
cially the farm boy’s labor, has a greater money value than the city child’s labor, 
and that the farmer is therefore under a special temptation to keep his boys out 
of school. On the whole, there is quite as much need of an efficient compulsory 
attendance law in the country as in the city, and perhaps more. 
The subcommittee has not taken space to discuss, in general, the common ‘edu- 
cation that the American States are now furnishing the American people. That 
is a large subject, and for the most part lies outside the field of the present inquiry. 
It will suffice to say on this large question that the people had better pay what 
they do pay for what they get than to go without it, or even twice, thrice, or four 
times the sum; but at the same time they might receive and should receive a great 
deal more for their money than at present. This is particularly true of the rural 
schools. No doubt there are many excellent schools in the country, but on the 
whole it may well be doubted whether any money that is expended in the people’s 
interest is expended more wastefully than what goes to the country schools. No 
doubt the country school has points of advantage over the city school, as the freer 
communion with nature, but on the whole it is inferior. The typical “little red 
schoolhouse,” so invested with sentiment, is a costly and unsatisfactory institution 
of education. Owing to social changes, in many parts of the country it is much 
less efficient and useful, at least relatively, than once it was, and a new organi- 
zation is imperatively called for. Something should be done to stop the wasteful 
expenditure of the public money. State Superintendent Stetson, speaking for his 
State, puts the case thus in a communication to the subcommittee: 
Ihave devoted quite a number of pages in my report [1895] to showing the 
people of Maine that we are wasting an enormous sum of money in this State 
because of the unbusinesslike methods which are used in the expenditure of its 
school funds, This waste is made in every direction in which money is spent. 
We pay more than we need to for school lots, the erection of school buildings, the 
furnishing of school appliances, text-books, fuel, making repairs, etc. The waste 
along these lines aggregates more than one-third of a million of dollars each year. 
I have shown in the report that the money which we spend for common schools is 
sufficient to maintain schools taught by professionally trained teachers and super- 
intended by competent superintendents; that in addition to doing these two 
important things we would have money enough left to supply them with the 
appliances necessary for a successful school, and also furnish the needed appara- 
tus, library books, and make all the needed repairs and additions. I feel that I 
have demonstrated this point so that there will be no further question about it in 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-924
  844 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the State of Maine. The whole matter turns upon the simple point that we are 
alarmingly wasteful in our expenditure of school money. 
Personally I am in favor of local communities being responsible for providing 
school buildings. I think two-thirds of the funds required for the maintenance of 
the common schools should be furnished by the State, and that the other third 
should be raised by local taxation; that the State should examine all teachers and 
issue all licenses to teach; that towns thus receiving State aid must employ 
teachers who hold such certificates. The State should inspect the school accounts 
of the towns receiving State aid. 
The subcommittee deems it advisable, now that the whole ground has been 
covered, to restate the fundamental propositions that have been urged in this 
report. These all start from the one central postulate that a provision of funds 
sufficient for their adequate support is essential to the existence and life of good 
schools. The threefold division of the subject will be preserved in the summary. 
I, REVENUE. 
1. The great resource of the public schools is, and must continue to be, some 
form or forms of public taxation. 
2, Such areas or units of taxation should be created, or continued if already in 
existence, as will fully develop the sound American principle that the whole 
wealth of the State sliall be made available for educating all the youth of the 
State. . 
3. To accomplish this end, resort must be had to the larger units of taxation, 
especially where population is sparse and wealth meager. The following recom- 
mendations must be specifically urged: (1) A liberal provision of funds from the 
State treasury; (2) a county tax in at least all the county-system States; (3) a 
town or township tax in the States where this civil division exists; (4) taxes in 
special districts; that is, in cities and villages. The school district, in the com- 
monly accepted sense of that term, is not a desirable taxing unit, but quite the 
contrary, and should be abolished as such unit. 
Il, DISTRIBUTION. 
1. Funds raised by the large political or social units for general school purposes 
shold be distributed in such a way as to bring the rich and the strong to the help 
of tae poor and the weak. 
2. Such rules of distribution should be adopted as will accomplish this end. In 
order to do this, distribution must be based, to a certain extent at least, upon 
fixed or arbitrary units; that is, so much money must be given to the school or to 
the teacher. 
8. The large taxing units should render assistance to the small ones only upon 
the condition that the small ones first do something for themselves. 
Ill, ORGANIZATION, 
1. In the States where the town or mixed system of local government exists, the 
town or township school system should, as far as practicable, be substituted for 
the district system; in the county-system States the county-school system is the 
natural alternative to the district system. 
2. In those parts of the country where existing physical and social conditions 
render it practicable, there should be such a consolidation of rural schools as will 
diminish the existing number of schools, schoolhouses, and teachers, and bring 
together, at advantageous points, the pupils who are now divided and scattered 
among the isolated schools of the township or other similar districts. 
3. There is urgent need of lengthening materially the time that the country 
schools, on theaverage, are in session each year. The ideal should be a minimum 
school year in every State of at least one hundred and sixty or one hundred and 
eighty days.
-P-A-G-E-925

REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 845 
The subcommittee does not expect to see, ana does not desire to see, the school 
systems of the country all brought to one uniform pattern. It is too well aware 
of the great diversity of conditions that exist to think such a thing is possible. 
Eyen more, a certain variety, and so conflict, of systems is conducive to life, 
activity, and improvement. Neither is the subcommittee under any illusions as 
to what is possible, or probable, in a field of education so vast as that offered by 
the United States, with the great number of authorities, State and local. At the 
same time there are certain general laws governing successful school systems and 
schools that can not be ignored. Some of the principal of these laws have been 
set forth above; and it is believed that their general recognition will be followed 
bya marked improvement of the common schools, and so of the popular education 
of the country. 
Some persons may ask, ‘‘ How shall the principles laid down in this report be 
made practical?” ‘‘ How shall they be established in communities or States where 
they do not exist, or exist only in part?” To these questions only a general answer 
isneeded. The State legislature, the lawmaking authority, is the only source of 
power in relation to education, as well as in relation to all other branches of the 
State government. Accordingly, if the school law is defective and weak, the 
legislature must be called upon to repair and strengthen it. No progress can be 
made without an efficient law and efficient school authorities. 
But how shall the legislature be induced to act in the premises? In precisely 
the same way that it is induced to act in other matters. Facts, arguments, per- 
suasion, must be addressed to the members of the legislature. Above all it is 
important that the public mind shall be informed as fully as possible upon all 
branches of the subject. If the people generally knew how much better schools 
they might have than those that they do now have, and for no more cost, itis 
impossible to believe that they would not bestir themselves to effect reforms. 
The subcommittee marks out what it believes to be broad lines of educationa- 
progress. It enforces its views, as far as possible, with appropriate arguments. 
But it must necessarily leave the application of these views and arguments to the 
exigencies existing in particular communities or States to such persons, belonging 
to these communities or States,as are interested in the subject and are familiar 
with all the local facts and conditions.

REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SUPERVISION. 
The subcommittee on supervision of rural schools has taken into careful con- 
sideration the various topics submitted for investigation. Its inquiries have 
extended into all the States and Territories except Indian Territory and Alaska, 
and the facts are based on returns more or less full from all parts of the country. 
Professional supervision is to-day regarded as an essential factor in our school 
system. It has been observed that the schools that are closely supervised by men 
who thoroughly know their business at once respond to the influence of this 
supervision. Expert supervision has resulted in systematic, orderly, and well- 
directed instruction. It is a matter of remark that the most competent superin- 
tendents have the best schools, and that cities noted for their excellence in school 
work have attained this preeminence through the medium of intelligent supervi- 
sion. This is also true of those counties which have come under the same 
influence. 
“There is no other agency in our school system that has done so much for the 
improvement of our schools in organization, and in methods of instruction and 
discipline, as the superintendency.” 2 
The attention of the profession, however, has been mainly directed toward 
 
-P-A-G-E-926
  846 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
expert supervisions in city schools, and but little heed has been paid to the demand 
for such work in rural districts. It is quite time that our inquiries should be 
directed toward the character of the supervision demanded by the country school. 
If supervision through a competent superintendent is a good thing for city schools, 
there is every reason why it would be a good thing for rural schools. 
STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Although the State superintendent stands at the head of the public-school sys- 
tem of the State, his work is more closely related to rural than to city schools. 
As this report has reference only to the conditions of rural schools, your subcom- 
mittee will consider the duties of this officer as bearing upon that part alone of 
the general school system. No officer connected with the administration of State 
affairs requires higher or more essential qualifications than that of superintendent 
of publicinstruction. Heshould bea man of high moral character, well acquainted 
with approved methods and with the history and condition of education in his 
State. He should be in close touch with the educational spirit of the times, and 
should be one whom the profession regards as authority in all that constitutes 
excellence in school matters. It is also agreed that he should be an experienced 
teacher, of broad and thorough scholarship, and a good public speaker. With 
these qualifications there should be combined a large share of good common sense, 
and sufficient executive ability to manage the details of his office. 
The legal term of office in Massachusetts and Rhode Island is one year. In 
Connecticut it is at the pleasure of the State board. In twenty States the term of 
office is two years; in four States, three years; in seventeen States, four years; but 
in no State does it exceed four years. The average length of term of the State 
superintendent is two years and ten months. The lowest salary paid is$1,000 and 
the highest $5,000 per year. The average salary is $2,475 per year. In answer to 
the question as to how much time the State superintendent devotes to supervision 
of schools, we had definite answers from thirty-seven States, in which we find 
that nineteen of these superintendents devote more than half of their time to 
visiting schools and traveling in the interest of education, and eighteen devote 
less than half their time. Quite a number of the State superintendents report 
that they divide their time equally between the office work and supervision. In 
only a few of the States does the State superintendent exercise no supervision, and 
in several the supervision is carried on through deputies or agents. 
The State superintendent under present arrangements has but little time for 
personal inspection of school work. The superintendents in fourteen States visit 
each county once a year and in eight States once every two years. From the other 
States no definite information could be obtained. Many superintendents say, as 
often as practicable; in some instances, not atall. Our information is to the effect 
that most of the State superintendents devote as much time to supervision as they 
can spare, but that it is generally considered secondary to work of a clerical nature, 
There are undoubtedly in some States sections which have never been visited by 
the State superintendent or his deputy. 
By some means the influence of the State superintendent should be extended 
until it reaches every rural school in the State. In all possible ways the office 
should be made useful to the teachers and school officers. The rural schools need 
this stimulating, helpful influence more even than those of the city. While in 
most States the office has but little more than advisory powers, yet, through lec- 
tures at associations and through the inspection of institutes, the State superin- 
tendent ought to be able to convince the teachers of rural schools that he is in close 
sympathy with their work. 
The work of the State superintendent ought to be made more effective by so 
increasing his clerical force as to enable him to spend more time in direct contact
-P-A-G-E-927
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 847 
with the schools and school officials of the State. The careful compilation of sta- 
tistics is very important, but it can be intrusted to a skillful statistician, while 
much of the routine work of the office can be well done by clerks. The higher 
and by far the more important work of directing educational movements, of 
instructing the people, and of creating public opinion and arousing public interest 
devolves upon the State superintendent. There is a general demand for more 
assistance in his office, longer tenure of service, and more liberal financial sap- 
port. His work should:be so related to that of the superintendents in the various 
subdivisions of the State for school purposes that the whole may be properly artic- 
ulated, and the county or town superintendents be under his direction and con- 
trol. He should come in frequent contact with them by conventions held for the 
purpose of instructing them in their particular duties, and should send them such 
circulars and letters as may be necessary to aid and direct them in their work. 
The State superintendent should have the power to withhold the State appro- 
priation from all counties or school districts not complying with the law in every 
particular, because he would then hold the key to the situation and could enforce 
his orders, 
The main duties of the State superintendent are not only to organize and direct 
educational influence and laws already existing, but also to go among the people 
in the spirit of Horace Mann, and, by public addresses, by the liberal use of the 
press, and by securing the assistance of the leading men of the State, to arouse 
and keep alive an interest in the cause of popular education. In connection with 
the rural schools especially the State superintendent not only has great possibilities 
for a wise supervisory influence, but also great opportunities to arouse and instruct 
the people. 
Ina majority of the States the most needful legislation is that which bears upon the 
organization and maintenance of rural schools, and a supply of competent teachers 
for the same. The State superintendent, therefore, should bea man able to secure 
the cooperation of the legislature for the enactment of proper statutes. This can 
be done only by one who sees clearly the great needs of the school system, and 
who is able to go before the people and the legislature and unite all influences to 
obtain the necessary legislation. While putting into this high office any person 
solely through his political affiliations is to be deprecated, the State superintendent 
should be a man who knows how to approach the leaders of all parties and con- 
vinco them of the justice and soundness of his plans, viewed from the high vantage 
ground of the general good. 2 
COUNTY, TOWNSHIP, OR DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT. 
A still more important question opened for discussion is the character and 
degree of supervision below that of the State superintendent.' Thirty-eight 
States, mainly in the South and West, have county superintendents, whose 
duty it is to visit the schools and exercise the duties usually belonging to 
their office. The New England States generally have what is known as township 
or district supervision, which arises in large part from their political organiza- 
tion. In New England the town is the dominant political unit, while in the South 
and West it is thecounty. The simplicity and effectiveness of supervision are pro- 
moted when the units of political organization and of school administration are 
identical. This condition hasits limitations, however, in theamount of territory to 
be covered and in the density of population, which isa varying quantity. The main 
point is to bring every rural school of the country as far as possible under the 
watchful care of a competent supervising officer. Responsibility is a strong

stimulant. It is one of the weak points in our present system that too often the 
rural school-teacher is responsible to no one. 
In regard to the operation of the two principal methods of supervision, there is 
no reason why any section should abandon the practice which has been found 
best adapted to its peculiar conditions. It must be conceded, however, that a sin- 
gle township, containing on an average ten or twelve schools, is too small a terri- 
tory to engage profitably the entire attention of one person. In such a case one 
of two things must necessarily happen: Either the schools are supervised to the 
point of interference, or the supervision becomes uncertain, feeble, and unsatis- 
factory. In a general way, the rural township is too small a supervisory unit. 
Wherever it has been tried the supervisor has generally had some other business 
to attend to, and thus his work has been found wanting in those results which are 
most desirable, Inorder that the work of overseeing and directing may be effective,” 
it must engage the entire time and the best thought of the supervisory officer. 
A proper remedy for this is the combination of towns for supervisory purposes. 
. Three, four, or five towns could be united in one supervisory district until a suffi- 
cient number of schools have been secured to engage the entire attention of one 
goodman. The burden of his salary could be borne by these towns in the propor- 
tion of the number of schools they contribute to his work. This plan is in opera- 
tion in Massachusetts, and has been satisfactory. A complete exposition of the 
Massachusetts plan of supervision of township schools is found in A. W. Edson’s 
monograph, ‘‘Supervision of schools in Massachusetts.” (Boston, 1895). 
In that State 253 of the towns are supervised by 155 supervisors. While some 
of the large towns can alone support a supervisor, several of the smaller ones 
must unite to secure the services of an efficient officer. In addition to what the 
towns do for themselves, the State grants to those of low valuation, when they 
combine into a supervisory district, the sum of $750 to pay for a supervisor. 
These towns, however, are required to raise an additional sum equal to that fur- 
nished by the State, thus insuring a sufficient sum for the employment of an 
expert schoolman. By these means 93 per cent of the children of Massachusetts 
have been brought under close supervision. The salary paid to a supervisor is at 
least $1,500 a year, and he is enabled to devote all his time to the work and to 
inspect each school once a month. It is true that there are still about one hun- 
dred towns in Massachusetts without supervision, yet the feasibility of coopera- 
tive supervision with aid from the State is proven beyond all doubt. 
“The State aid to a district amounts at present to $1,250—$750 toward the 
superintendent’s salary and $500 toward the salaries of the teachers. The remain- 
der of the superintendent’s salary, $750, must be raised by the towns of the dis- 
trict. They are at liberty, of course, to raise more than $750 for the purpose, if 
they desire to do so.” (Massachusetts State Report, 1895.) 
What has been said regarding the combination of towns for supervisory pur- 
poses can be repeated with equal emphasis as to other small divisions of territory 
termed ‘school districts.” The same principle applies here as elsewhere, that the 
interests of the schools included in a given territory should be sufficient to war- 
rant the employment of a thoroughly competent person at such a salary as would 
justify devoting his entire time to his work. After all has been done, there will 
still be vast sections of country, especially in the West and Southwest, without 
any means of efficient supervision. No present remedy can be devised to aid 
them. It can be safely left. for the several States, as population increases, to look 
after the interests of the schools in the light of the experience of older communi- 
ties about them. 
The worth of the county superintendency is acknowledged, but in many cases 
the county is too large an area and contains too many teachers for one man to 
properly supervise. The county is as much too large a unit for supervisory pur- 
poses as the township is toosmall. This remark, however, does not apply to every
-P-A-G-E-929
    
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 849 
county nor to any one State. In counties where the number of teachers is too 
large for one man to supervise the county superintendent should have one or more 
assistants or deputies to aid him in his work. They should be directly responsible 
to him for the kind and character of their work, and should be charged solely with 
supervisory duties. The importance of having one superintendent for the county 
or district to whom other supervisors are responsible must be emphasized, as it 
would be an error and a fruitful source of strife if in any territory there should 
be two or more supervisors having concurrent jurisdiction. 
THE COUNTY UNIT. 
Since this report is a symposium of suggestions for supervising rural schools, it 
may not be amiss to discuss a plan of supervisory organization that has found 
favor in some few counties that contain large cities as well as a rural population. 
We mention it here because it has valuable features for supervising the rural 
schools. There is but one school board for the entire county. One set of men 
legislates for the whole area, and it is their duty to relate the urban and suburban 
and rural schools into a sympathetic system. This is based upon the idea that 
every city is bound to respect the people that immediately environ it. It is tothe 
interest of a large city to have good roads leading to it, good crops in the fields 
around it, and good schools to which the farmers may send their children. 
With this as a foundation principle there is but one school fund for the entire 
county, raised by taxation upon all property in the county, whether it be in or out 
of the city. This makes the general school fund, which is distributed upon the 
basis of school population and according to the needs of the city wards and the 
rural communities. The same qualification for teachers is required whether they 
teach in a city graded school or in a country ungraded school, and the same salary 
is paid to them and in the same way and for just as long aterm. In this system 
one superintendent is in charge of the whole area. He looks after a city graded 
school one day and the next day may be 20 miles away inspecting a country school. 
Expert supervision by a superintendent and his assistants is thus extended into 
the rural districts, and both city and country school receive the benefit of what 
there may be in each that is of real value. 
Upon this plan, as a matter of course, a large portion of the school fund raised 
by taxation on city property is annually distributed to the country schools. The 
city is really made to assist in supporting the rural schools around it. And who 
shall say it is not a good thing for the city to do, especially in agricultural sec- 
tions, in which the education, liberal and special, of the farmer’s child is the prob- 
able salvation of the farming interests of the country? We should not lose sight 
of the truth that the farmer’s child is to be made a useful citizen, not only con- 
tent to stay in the home in which he was born and reared, if that is best, but fitted 
to fill honorably any station in life to which he may be called. To do this he must 
have all the opportunities of education and culture that the city affords. This can 
be brought about in no other way than at the city’s expense, for wealth is massed 
in our populous centers. The expert supervision, the well-trained teacher, the 
long term, the modern text-book, the good schoolhouse, can be placed at the 
farmer’s door by the agencies of the neighboring city, that owes him this and 
much more (Appendix D). 
TRAINED TEACHERS NEEDED IN COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
Supervision is one of the vital needs of the rural schools, since most of their 
teachers are inexperienced. The number of normal-school graduates in rural 
schools is lamentably small. The reason is that the normal-school graduate can 
obtain a better salary by teaching in a larger field. The demand for this class of 
teachers makes their salaries so high that the country schools can not afford to 
employ them. As soon as teachers become proficient by reason of experience

  850 © EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
acquired in rural schools, the probabilities are that they will be induced to seek 
better positions in cities where their experience and abilities will command higher 
salaries, 
Add to this the other fact that many young men begin to teach as a stepping- 
stone to some other profession, and while they are teaching a country school are 
studying law or medicine, and their hearts are with that rather than with teach- 
ing; and also add that many young girls teach until they marry, or as long as they 
are compelled to teach, and no longer; that they have no real love for their work 
and no wish to stay in it, and we see how the problems multiply. 
Rural schools suffer from lack of trained teachers. In them, asa general thing, 
are young graduates from the village high school, or some favorite among neigh- 
borhood families, or a type of ancient teacher whose placid life is not disturbed 
by the vexing problems of his profession. This raw material must be developed, 
made shapely, orderly, and systematic, if time is to be saved to the children, and 
schools properly supported. A bright and live supervisor will bring order out of 
confusion, harmony out of discord, and will give life and beauty to that which 
before was inert and ungainly. 
Teaching is a great art, based on a profound science. The supervisor is the 
expert who has given this art and science his careful attention and whose busi- 
ness it is both to know how to teach and to show others the way of teaching. 
He can in some measure compensate for the lack of skilled work in the school by 
closely supervising and guiding inexperienced teachers and showing them what 
to do. An expert is one who possesses skill gained by practice. A supervisor 
who claims to be an expert should have experimental knowledge of ‘‘the how to 
teach.” He is supposed to have given careful attention to those things which 
characterize a good school.’ Not only must he know how to teach, but he must 
Jmow how to instruct others in the art and science of teaching. He must be a 
skilled teacher of teachers. Without this directing spirit, schools must necessa- 
rily suffer until teachers happen upon some better way. It is a great misfortune 
for schools to wait for wisdom in teaching until the many mistakes of teachers 
have pointed out better methods. The presence of skilled supervision has been 
the salvation of many schools. 
‘It is one province of supervision in the country school to bring teachers into 
contact with each other, to illustrate better ways of teaching, to break up the iso- 
lation and monotony of rural school life, and to take to the doors and homes of 
people and teachers alike the life and freshness which have been the result of 
research and study on the part of the best minds in the profession. The province 
of supervision in rural schools falls far short of its legitimate purposes when it 
begins and ends in the schoolroom. 
This point is not sufficiently well appreciated by those who have the oversight 
and care of schools scattered over a large tract of territory. Country schools have 
an environment of their own which should neither be forgotten norignored. The 
best supervisory work is that which brings into the rural school everything in 
farm and rural life which is strong and pure and wholesome, It is possible for 
the supervising officer so to exert his influence as to give grace and dignity to each 
individual school and make it the rallying point for every good influence, a Bless. 
ing to the entire community in which it is situated. 
Attention is here called to the fact that in general but little care is taken in the 
selection of officers chosen to look after the interests of the rural schools. In the 
majority of States the county superintendents are elected by the people of the 
county without any regard to the preparation or qualifications they may have for 
the work. Very few States require the superintendents to have any special quali- 
fications, and in many instances supervisors are put in charge of teachers who 
know more about teaching than they do, and are required to hold examinations 
that they themselves could not pass. Add to this the fact that the superintend-
-P-A-G-E-931
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 851 
ents are generally paid very small salaries (average, $828 for the whole country) 
‘or a meager per diem, and that many engage in other business and regard super- 
vision of schools as an incidental matter, and it becomes apparent that profes- 
sional supervision is too often the exception rather than the rule. 
WORK OF SUPERVISORS. 
We needevery where trained superintendents of schools. ‘Supervision of schools 
should rank next in importance to the instruction in schools; indeed, so necessary 
to successful instruction is competent supervision that the two should receive 
together the watchful oversight of the State” (New Jersey State Report, 1894). 
Supervisors should know as much of teaching as the teachers under them, and 
should be able instinctively to distinguish good teachers by their manners, dress, 
speech, disposition, and character. The best work of a supervisor is his skill in 
selecting teachers. Not by the results of examination alone, for some learned 
people make poor instructors; not by yielding to the pressure of family or political 
influence, for this will ruin any system of schools; not by selecting his own friends 
or favorites, for this is unworthy of his office; but by following the knowledge 
that comes to him through study, by long experience, by careful observation, and 
by conscientious conviction, which enables him to know a teacher when he meets 
one, though he may not be able to tell why. 
Teaching is a matter of both disposition and knowledge. The former can not 
be examined, but it ought to be recognized; careful supervision will aid in devel- 
oping it. Skill in doing this is an essential characteristic of a good supervising 
officer, especially in connection with rural schools. If the cry is raised (and it is) 
that there is not enough money to pay for professional supervision, the reply is 
that it would be wiser to have fewer teachers in order that those employed might 
be better qualified. A supervisor who is an expert can so arrange and organize 
the system that a less number of teachers can do the workand do it better, because 
each one is thoroughly competent. ‘A good superintendent earns many times his 
salary; a poor superintendent is too dear at any price. The work of supervision 
may be unsatisfactory either because the number of schools is too large for the 
oversight of one person, or because the supervising officer lacks the talent for 
molding, inspiring, and directing the work of others” (Pennsylvania State 
Report, 1895). Underpaid supervision is often unskilled and inefficient, and 
against this we raise our decided protest. Such supervision is of no value what- 
ever to the schools—a penny-wise policy that economizes in the wrong place. A 
supervisor should have no other business than to care for the schools. He should 
not be a merchant, nor a lawyer, nor a farmer, nor an active teacher. His busi- 
ness should be to supervise the schools of his county, or township, or district, or 
whatever his area be called. 
With a given sum of money for school purposes, to devote a part of it to skilled 
supervision will bring more children under enrollment, better teachers in the com- 
munity, better instruction in the schools,and more satisfaction to the people, than 
if all the money were spent in paying the salaries of teachers. 
In twenty-eight States the supervisors are required by law to visit each school 
twice a year, in the other States they are allowed to visit the schools as often as 
practicable. In one or two States the supervisors visit the schools very seldom. 
The length of time the supervisor spends in each school varies from fifteen minutes 
to one-half day. The time seems to depend very largely upon circumstances, the 
number of pupils, the character of the teacher, the efficiency, and the pay of the 
supervisor. A skilled supervisor inspecting an intelligent teacher can do more 
service in fifteen minutes than an unskilled supervisor visiting a poor teacher can 
do ina whole day. The average time spent in the ordinary rural school by the 
school supervisor is about one hour every year. 
In twelve States the supervisors devote all their time to the work. In these
-P-A-G-E-932
  852 EDUCATION REPORT. 1896-97. 
States the average salary is $1,002 a year. In fourteen States the supervisors 
devote only a part of their time to supervision, with an average annual salary of 
$408. Sixteen States report that in some counties the supervisors devote all 
their time to supervision, while in other counties the supervisors devote but a 
small part of their time to that work. In these States the salaries paid supervisors 
vary from $100 to $2,000 or $3,000 a year. Where good salaries are paid they 
devote all their time to supervision. Where small salaries are paid they devote 
but little time to this special work. All States have some supervision, though it 
varies greatly in amount and in efficiency. 
In many sections of the country a supervisor not capable of suggesting to teach- 
ers better methods of teaching and not able to detect false methods pays only a 
perfunctory visit to the schools. He merely sees whether the building is clean, 
whether the children look bright and interesting, whether the enrollment is good, 
such facts as would be noticed by any person of ordinary common sense. Too 
often the contact of the average supervisor and the teacher of the rural schools is 
nothing more than a mechanical business performance, with such elements of aid 
and encouragement as any intelligent visitor may give the school. Although this 
is not without advantage, it falls far below the standard of professional supervision. 
How many teachers a supervisor can direct can not be discussed except in a gen- 
eral way. Schools are more widely separated in some localities than in others, 
roads are better, teachers are better, and supervisors vary greatly in the rapidity 
with which they work. Asa general rule, however, every rural school ought to 
be visited at least once in two months. Supervision can not be called close that 
does any less than that, and it would be better if the schools could be visited once 
every month. 
No accurate information can be gained concerning the conditions of the school, 
nor can the proper influence be exerted over teacher and pupils, unless the super- 
visor has time at his disposal to make a reasonably thorough examination of the 
school and its surroundings. Sometimes, with an inexperienced teacher, he 
may find it necessary to spend the entire day in the school, while in other cases 
he may be able to visit two or more schools in one day. The point is that he 
must not feel compelled to shorten his visit, or to leave his work half done, in 
order to meet other engagements. To make his visits effective in the highest 
degree requires time and patience. The length of his visit must depend upon the 
necessities of the school, and of these he must be his own judge. An ideal sys- 
tem of supervision would give one supervisor from fifty to seventy-five teachers 
to supervise. Where the number of teachers is greater some will be neglected, 
for asupervisor generally has many interruptions in his work, such as rainy days, 
holidays, and the demand upon his time for office work, board meetings, commit- 
tee meetings, public addresses, etc., so that it is impossible to put in every day in 
supervision. Allowance must be made for other important duties. 
Attention is also called to the power which the supervisor can exert through 
rightly conducted teachers’ meetings, institutes, associations, and round tables. 
Here he may meet the teachers under his direction, and make use of the informa- 
tion which he has gathered in visiting their schools. From free und open discus- 
sions by the teachers he will get an insight into their habits of thought and their 
methods of expression. Such meetings help break up the unsocial character of 
rural teachers by bringing them into contact, so that each learns something from 
the experience of all the others. In this way teachers and supervisors become 
better acquainted, gather fresh courage and new inspiration, and go home feeling 
that they have much in common, and that, if they will, they can in many ways 
be mutually helpful. The most deadening influence about the country school is 
its isolation. Nothing is more potent in overcoming this than frequent gather- 
ings in which teachers, school officers, and parents freely discuss matters of com- 
mon interest. To encourage such meetings is one of the duties incumbent upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-933
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 853 
the supervisor. Without being too prominent, he may still be the inspiring 
spirit, guiding, directing, and stimulating the tone and energies of all who par- 
ticipate in the proceedings (Appendix P). 
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS, 
The necessity of establishing some qualifications to be required of those who are 
to occupy the position of supervising officer is emphatically insisted upon. 
“If it is desirable to insist upon a certain degree of qualification for a school- 
teacher in the humblest district of the State (this proposition has passed beyond 
the realm of discussion), it would seem that there is no question that the superior 
officer clothed by statute with such extended powers as a school commissioner 
ought to be a person possessing some fixed qualification for the performance of 
the duties of his office. The schools of the State will never reach that degree of 
efficiency which the State has a right to demand, and which is expected from the 
generous provision made for their support by the people, until this evil is cor- 
rected. Some standard of qualification should be insisted upon, and the power of 
removal in case of the election of a person not possessing these qualifications 
should be vested in the State superintendent.” (New York State Report, 1895.) 
In only seventeen States are there any qualifications, beyond that of being a 
resident and a voter. In some States a first-grade license is required, in others a 
normal or university course, and again in others he must be an experienced teacher. 
In a majority of the States, however, the electors are allowed to choose any per- 
son without regard to educational qualifications. 
In answer to circulars of inquiry the following information was obtained regard- 
ing supervisors: 
Wisconsin: By the law of 1895, must hold a university, normal, State, or special 
superintendent certificate. 
New York: No standard of qualification. 
Pennsylvania: Must hold a college diploma, or a State or local certificate; must 
have at least three years’ experience in teaching. 
Michigan: Must be a graduate of a reputable college, university, or State nor- 
mal college, or must hold a State or first-grade certificate. 
Mississippi: Must hold a first-grade certificate. 
Texas: Must be a person of educational attainments and hold a first-grade 
teacher's certificate. 
Tennessee: Can be appointed only from applicants who pass an examination on 
questions sent out by State board. 
Georgia: Must pass a satisfactory examination. 
Louisiana: Must have a common-school education. 
Montana: Must hold a first-grade certificate and have one year’s experience as 
teacher. 
South Carolina: Must be able to conduct a teachers’ institute. 
Kentucky: Must be able to obtain a first-class teacher’s certificate, hold a State 
diploma, or State certificate. 
Arkansas: Must have a first-grade certificate. 
Maryland: The county school board may require applicants to be examined by 
the State superintendent. 
Utah: Must have a valid certificate not lower than the grammar grade. 
West Virginia: Must be skilled in the art of teaching. 
Iowa: First-class certificate, good for two years, a State certificate, or a life 
diploma. 
It is unquestionably true that a supervisor should be as well and as highly edu- 
cated as the better teachers he supervises. He should bea man of broad and 
generous culture, a lover of good books, versed in the best literature of the day, 
one whose presence is an influence for good, and whose words are an inspiration. 
 
-P-A-G-E-934
  854 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
To require him to be in every case a graduate of some higher school would be 
unreasonable, perhaps, but he should be a friend of higher education in every 
sense of the word. He must for a long time continue to be one from whom will 
come the influence which will lead the pupils in the rural district to strive for the 
highest education possible under the circumstances. His influence shvuld be 
given to the establishment of rural or township high schools wherever the popula- 
tion will permit it. These schools should include in their courses whatever is 
required on the one hand for entrance to the school of the next higher grade, or, 
on the other, those studies. a knowledge of which can be made so to change life 
on the farm, in its various forms, that it will become more attractive and more 
profitable. In the establishment and conduct of such schools the influence of the 
supervisor should be a very prominent factor. 
A supervisor should have a thorough knowledge of school work. He should 
know what a teacher ought to do in managing a class of pupils of any age on any 
subject. This is one of the things he is paid to know. He should be an expert to 
whom teachers may go for advice and direction. If the advice is good and the 
direction wise, teachers will have confidence in the administration of the schools, 
and rely more and more upon the supervisor. The system is thus reduced to uni- 
formity and becomes a source of strength. The supervisor should be able to direct 
teachers in their professional reading, and select wisely a library of teachers’ 
books, and place them where they are most needed. He should know about school 
periodicals and be able to form his. teachers into reading clubs and circles, and 
direct their studies. He should be able to arrange teachers’ meetings so that time 
will not be wasted, and that teachers will come with pleasure and stay with profit. 
He ought to be able to aid in selecting a library suited to the wants and tastes of 
an agricultural community (Appendix L). In school extension he should bea 
leader, for he can thus make his influence felt in every part of his territory. In 
directing the home reading of the pupils and the people he may, if he will, find an 
immense field of usefulness. He can thus create and foster an interest in the wel- 
fare of the farm and the home as adjuncts to the rural schools. 
He can understand and sympathize with teachers better if he has an experi- 
mental knowledge of their work. No supervisor is so good as: he who climbed 
from the lowest rounds and knows all the steps. That this is indispensable we 
are not prepared to state. There are some. very excellent supervisors who have 
but little experince in teaching, but who have seen enough and studied enough to 
know how it ought to be done. Experience would have been helpful, however, in 
understanding the limitations of their work. 
First and foremost, a supervisor should be able to instruct his teachers in the 
methods of organization and management of schools. This is particularly the 
case in rural schools, where so few teachers have acquired skill in teaching. But 
instruction with a teacher is like instruction with a child. There must be an 
awakening, an arousing, a hungering after instruction. The conditions of ‘being 
filled” are that we must “‘hunger and thirst.” The supervisor must inspire his 
teachers with a desire for better things. He should lead them to see that time is 
precious, and that the children in school this year may be on the farms next year 
and no more in school forever. They must know what to do and doit. The 
supervisor should be a source of inspiration. His corps of teachers must be 
alive and eager and studious. The thing most to be abhorred in school work is 
the teacher dead to advancement in professional studies. The supervisor must 
rouse teachers to work out for themselves plans and methods for building up 
their schools, and must set forth the principles which should control them in their 
work. 
The county superintendent, or the supervisor of schools in any rural commu- 
nity, should have had recent experience in the schools which he is to supervise. 
In cases where this is not possible he should make a careful study of the peculiar
-P-A-G-E-935
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 855 
surroundings of the schools of which he is to take charge. If the new departure 
which seems to be at hand in rural-school education is to be a success, it must 
be carefully conducted in reference to those environments which are peculiar to 
each section. The supervisor who is to have a controlling influence in choice of 
text-books, in courses of study, in the selection and use of libraries, should be 
thoroughly conversant with the physical characteristics of his district, with the 
interests of the people, with their sources of wealth and living, and with the home 
life of the children (Appendix O). Whether it be a mining or a grazing region, 
whether agriculture or horticulture predominates as an interest, he should make 
himself at home in that domain of science or knowledge which will increase his 
usefulness as a school officer. 
THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL, 
The parents of children need instruction as well as the children themselves. 
The home influence and the school influence should be harmonious, or confusion 
and uncertainty will arise in the child’s mind as to what he should do. The peo- 
ple must be reminded that the school is an integral part of the community, and 
not a separate affair which the law compels them to support and which takes 
their children away when their assistance on the farm is most valuable (Appen- 
dix O). : 
In establishing the true relations between the home and the school, between 
the necessities of physical and those of intellectual education, the supervisor of 
rura\ schools finds an unlimited field of usefulness. In rural districts parents 
are often ignorant of the advancement education has made since the days when 
they went to school, and they are often too ready to criticise anything new. The 
supervisor must gain their confidence, so that they will yield their ideas to his 
and allow the teacher in their school to follow his directions without any hin- 
drance from them. 
The supervisor can exert a wonderful influence in bringing the fireside to the 
support of the teacher. Todo this he must be able to educate the people con- 
cerning their relation to the school, as to sending the children regularly, as to 
providing necessary material, such as books, etc., as to allowing every teacher to 
pursue those methods of teaching which his skill and experience suggest as best 
suited to the wants of the school. At meetings of agricultural clubs, at town 
rallies, at educational ‘“ barbecues,” at commencements, at spring festivals, at 
farmers’ institutes, he should embrace every opportunity of saying a word for the 
schools, in order to arouse the people and interest them in the whole system of 
education. The columns of the country paper afford the supervisor a very ready 
means of reaching the people. Almost every farmer takes the county paper, 
which, coming weekly to his fireside, gives the news of the outside world and the 
doings of his neighbors. School news is an important item and should never be 
omitted. Every week the paper should contain something of educational interest 
from the pen of the supervisor, though not always over his signature—sugges- 
tions for improvement, statistics of enrollment and attendance, new and better 
ways of teaching, plans for schoolhouse construction and decoration. The press 
is valuable to every teacher and helpful to the system of education by bringing 
farmers into sympathy with the great educational movements of the world. The 
press gives a larger audience, though it enforces a shorter address. But a little 
every week, full of variety and interest, will eventually build up a healthy senti- 
ment in the county and educate parents as well as children. 
The supervisor should have a direct or indirect control of the selection of teach- 
ers. The crisis in the history of schools is when teachers are to be chosen. No 
one is so well qualified to choose them wisely as a faithful supervisor, and no one 
is more likely to do so conscientiously, since he knows the value of efficient teach-
-P-A-G-E-936

ers. This control can be given him directly or indirectly. If he does not wish to 
have the direct choice in individual instances, the same may be accomplished by 
giving him the power to examine and license teachers for his supervisory district. 
No one, then, can be selected by the board of directors except such as are approved 
by him. He prepares an eligible list to which the board is limited in making its 
choice. If the superintendent is conscientious and courageous in the preparation 
of this list, he can safely leave the responsibility of the individual appointments 
to the board. 
In many cases the questions for such examination are prepared at the State 
office. In some instances the county board conducts the examinations, and ina 
few the answer papers are sent to the State office for final examination and 
approval or rejection. 
The supervisor should be slow to condemn a teacher who is honestly striving to 
succeed, but if, after faithful and earnest effort, teachers clearly prove that school- 
teaching is not their vocation, or, after repeated warnings, teachers will not try 
to do the right kind of work, it is clearly the duty of the supervisor to report the 
facts to the directors, and his report should be given great weight by them. The 
power to revoke the certificate is usually in the hands of the supervisory officer. 
It should be exercised with great caution and deliberation, but fearlessly whenever 
there is sufficient reason for it. 
Since the supervisor is responsible for school methods and for results in teach- 
ing, the arrangement of the course of study and the selecting of the text-books 
should be largely, if not entirely, left to his direction. It is his particular busi- 
ness to know books as well as to know teachers. It is not to be expected that the 
men who constitute the ordinary ‘‘committee on text-books” and whose daily 
business has no relation whatever to school texts and their use, can decide what 
book is best for use in the schoolroom. It is very well to have a committee on 
text-books composed of the members of the board, to prevent possible abuse, but 
the advice of the supervisor should have much influence in determining the 
character of the books used in the schools. 
SCHOOL DIRECTORS. 
It is important that the relations between the supervisor and the school officers 
should be clearly defined. The directors! stand much nearer the people and have 
an immediate interest in the welfare of the schools. They contract with the 
teachers, care for the financial affairs of the district, purchase supplies, and are 
charged with the general business management. 
The success of the school depends very largely upon the kind of men who are 
elected to that office. In the rural districts especially the duties of the director 
are mainly of asupervisory nature. He should inspect frequently the schoolhouse 
and school premises; he should see to it that everything is provided which is nec- 
essary for the comfort and convenience of both teacher and pupils, that the out- 
buildings are in a decent condition, and that the Supplies are used with due regard 
toa wise economy. In the discipline of the school he should give a strong moral 
support to the teacher, and his influence should at all times be on the side of order 
and obedience. The board of directors should make such rules and regulations for 
all the schools under its control as it deems necessary for the preservation of school 
property, for securing punctuality and regularity, and for the general welfare of 
all concerned, and it should support the teachers in their rigid enforcement. It 
should be in constant correspondence with the supervisor, so as to keep him 
informed respecting the progress of the school, and in case a teacher is derelict in 
his duties, or if for any reason the school needs a special visitation, it should

director, commissioner, school committee, trustee, etc.
-P-A-G-E-937
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 857 
inform him at once. On the other hand, it should be the aim of the supervisor to 
establish the most cordial and intimate relations with the local directors. The 
supervisor should magnify the office of the director. Whenever he visits the school, 
he should, if possible, induce the director to go with him. If at such visits they 
inspect the condition of the outbuildings and the premises, the supervisor can 
often propose plans for the improvement of the buildings which the director will 
more readily appreciate and approve. 
The inspection of a school by a competent supervisor is an object lesson of 
importance to the director. He is able to see at what points the supervisor is aim- 
ing, and he learns something of hisideas and plans. He will thus be better able to 
counsel and advise the teacher in the frequent visits which he makes to the school and 
make more intelligent and specific reports to the supervisor. The practice on the 
part of the supervisor of calling the directors together at stated times for mutual 
conference is very commendable. These officers are often ignorant of their duties, 
but in alarge majority of cases they are willing and anxious to learn. There is 
no more effective way of improving the rural schools than that of instructing and 
informing the men who have them in their immediate charge. No doubt large 
sums are lost to the various funds through carelessness on the part of treasurers 
and secretaries in the rural districts in keeping their accounts. The supervisor 
should make it his duty to audit these books at least once each year, with a view 
to accuracy of statistics and economy in expenditures, and this should be one of 
his duties under the law. 
THE VISITATION OF SCHOOLS. 
The supervisor’s method of visiting schools may be considered briefly. First, 
he visits schools to see how and what the teachers teach, whether their manner is 
composed, their method clear and concise, their style interesting; whether they 
are teaching valuable facts or wasting time on trifles; whether they are teaching 
what is right or what is wrong. Second, he goes to find out what the pupils 
know. This is a test of the past work of teachers, which is shown by the general 
manner of recitation, the promptness with which pupils reply, the amount of 
information they have, the degree of skill they manifest, or the power of original 
thinking they have developed. Third, he inspects the physical conditions of the 
school building and grounds. He should note the condition of the outbuilding, 
and if he finds them unsuitable in any respect, he should say so frankly to teachers 
and directors, and insist upon a change at once. The supervisor must know 
whether good light, good seats, proper temperature and ventilation, and thorough 
drainage are secured. The supervisor should carefully observe the moral atmos- 
phere which surrounds the school, whether it ison the side of order and obedience, 
of modesty, and of all those virtues which make the character of the typical 
American citizen. All these are demanded in order that good teaching may be 
made possible, and good health and public morals may be preserved, : 
Such being the purpose of the visit, the supervisor should put himself in easy 
and cordial relations with the teacher and the pupils, that he may have a true 
understanding of what each can do, The teacher may conduct one or more reci- 
tations in the various subjects of study, in order that the supervisor may see the 
usual methods of instruction. The supervisor can then suggest improvements if 
needed, and can even take the class in hand and demonstrate them. That he 
should ask for a class in any particular study and give the pupils a rigid oral or 
even written review, while the teacher may be attending to some other duty, is 
proper, for by this means he can find out how much instruction has been given 
since his last visit and how thoroughly the course of study is being adhered to. It 
is, however, often best to allow the teacher to pursue the usual routine of exer- 
‘cises, in order that the supervisor may see the school at its everyday work. 
An inspection of the teacher’s register should not be forgotten. Such a register  
-P-A-G-E-938
  858 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
inevery rural school should show the name and age of each pupil, the studies pur- 
sued, where each class commenced and its progress during the term, so that a now 
teacher can at a glance understand at what point the study of each branch to be 
taught is to be taken up. The supervisor should insist that such a register be 
carefully kept by every teacher under his control. 
A private record of his own, in which names, dates, classes heard, condition of 
rooms and premises, material needed, and general observations are kept, will aid 
the supervisor. He can by this means trace the development of any one school 
and can more readily observe whether it progresses or retrogrades. 
SCHOOLHOUSES AND FURNITURE. 
Before closing, your subcommittee desires to emphasize the proposition that the 
supervisor should have a controlling voice in the erection of the rural school- 
house, as respects allits sanitary conditions: Before the contract for a new build- 
ing can be legally let, the written approval of the supervisor should be necessary, 
certifying that as concerns heating, lighting, ventilation, and everything which 
conduces to the health and physical growth of the pupils, the requirements of 
hygienic rules and sanitary science have been carefully and fully complied with. 
The rural schoolhouse should be built in accordance with the laws of sanitation 
and modern civilization (Appendix M). It never will be until the State, speaking 
through the supervisor, compels it as a prerequisite for receiving a share of the 
public funds. 
The supervisor should not be blind to the small things which minister to the 
comfort of the pupils. Often the rural-school teacher has received no instruction 
upon these points. If the supervisor finds pupils facing a strong light, he should 
call attention to the evils likely to ensue, and suggest aremedy. Thesame is true 
as regards unsuitable desks or seats. The necessity of proper ventilation and 
proper temperature should be constantly dwelt upon. Without a thermometer, 
with no means of ventilation except the door and windows, the rural-school 
teacher needs and appreciates all the suggestions an intelligent supervisor may 
make. 
Akin to this is the suggestion that the supervisor should insist that the school- 
room be kept clean and neat for sanitary reasons. The floors should be scoured 
as often as they are soiled; the wood, trash, and ashes should be carefully kept 
away from around the stove. The walls should be swept free of dust, the chalk 
racks kept clean, and the window panes polished. Pupils also should be required 
to keep their desks in order and their books clean. It is stimulating to the little 
ones and helpful to teachers for the supervisor to have them show their books and 
to take occasion to comment on the care or on the untidiness with which they 
are kept. 
No better educational influence can surround the children than a well-arranged 
schoolroom whose floors and windows are clean, whose walls are free from dust 
and decorated with pictures, whose school grounds are well ordered and shaded 
by trees and adorned with flowers, and the school presided over by a qualified 
teacher who is the personification of neatness and good cheer. Under such con- 
ditions the child is self-restrained and respects himself because his surroundings 
are respectable. 
The child naturally puts himself in harmony with his environment. If the 
teacher is neat and the schoolhouse is in proper order, the pupil will copy the 
example. Day by day beautiful, comfortable, and clean surroundings will have 
their ethical influence upon his development, until he comes in time to abhor any- 
thing that is not beautiful, well ordered, and clean. This point is too often over- 
looked in plans for supervision. The reverse of this feature is also true. The 
rural schoolhouse, generally speaking, in its character and surroundings is depress- 
ing and degrading. There is nothing about it calculated to cultivate a taste for
-P-A-G-E-939
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 859 
the beautiful in art or nature. If, under the influence of intelligent supervision, 
this can be changed, it will be a work over which coming generations will rejoice, 
«“‘There is scarcely a sounder principle in pedagogy than that care begets care; 
order, order; cleanliness, cleanliness; and beauty, beauty. Things conspicuously 
good command the respect of children, invite their imitation, and in ways real, 
though obscure, sink into their souls and mold their being: The power of good 
example in men and women no one disputes, but there is power akin to it in things, 
provided they embody the better thoughts of men and women—a power of which 
more should be made in school management than is made at present.” (Massa- 
chusetts State Report, 1895.) 
If children are daily surrounded by those influences that elevate them, that 
make them clean and well ordered, that make them love flowers, and pictures, and 
proper decorations, they at last reach that degree of culture where nothing else 
will please them. When they grow up and have homes-of their own, they must 
haye them clean, neat, bright with pictures, and fringed with shade trees. and 
flowers, for they have been brought up to be happy in no otherenvironment. The 
true test of our civilization and culture is the kind of home we are content to live 
in, and the influences of our schools should help to form a disposition for those things 
that’ make home life happy and healthy. If the farmer’s boy can be taught to love 
books when. he is at school, he will have a library in his home when he becomes a 
man; if the farmer's girl can be taught decoration at school, she will want pictures 
and flowers and embroidery when she becomes a woman. 
We appeal also for the influence of classical art in our schools. If we have pic- 
tures, why not have reprints of those that have moved the hearts of men? Why 
not have the best looking down from our school walls? They are within the reach 
of any purse. One reprint from the great masters is an uplifting influence for all 
time. Cheap and gaudy advertisements, glaring and painful chromos, depress the 
true spirit of art and perpetuate the crudeness we seek to overcome. 
The same can be said of music. If we are to sing songs, why not sing the songs 
of masters? They havesung many forchildren, beautiful far beyond the rude com- 
positions that fret our ears everywhere. Also with literature. Why not read the 
simple classics written for the little ones, and the greater classics for the older 
ones? Why notin all things get the noblest and. best that the world has given, and 
use them to help our children onward and upward? 
The silent influence of clean surroundings, of cheerful teachings, of classical pic- 
tures and music and literature, the presence of flowers and their care, the planting 
of shade trees and studies of their growth, will be a supervision so constant and so 
searching that no child can escape it. Under its potent warmth, like the steady, 
quiet shining of the sun, the child plant grows into all the marvelous possibility of 
flower and fruit. 
SUMMARY. 
1. As tothe character of the supervisor who is brought in.contact with the rural- 
school. teacher in the discharge of his official duties: 
(1) He should. be selected with special regard to his: peculiar fitness for that 
office. Whether his office is elective or appointive, his qualifications, in order 
that he may be eligible, should be such as to enable him to challenge the respect 
of those whose work he is required to supervise. 
(2) In regard to his scholarship, it should breathe that essential spirit of learning 
necessary to making good, strong schools. The position of supervisor should be 
made professional with a view of meeting the demand for the best education which 
the rural school can possibly afford. This requires a scholarship which is above 
that of the ordinary man. The tendency to put persons in the supervisory position 
who have no mental attainments’ worthy of mention is earnestly deprecated. 
(3) In regard to moral character, the supervisor should be a living, inspiring 
example of such a life as alone is worthy the Christian civilization of our times,
-P-A-G-E-940
ee eR ee are ee ee ee 
860 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
He should carry with him a spirit of sincerity in his work, so that people, teachers, 
and pupils may look to him with hearty respect, and with entire confidence in the 
integrity of his purposes. 
(4) In regard to his professional spirit, he should be in touch with the best edu- 
cational thought of the times, carrying with him to the country-school teacher and 
to the people of a rural community the freshness and life which come from reading 
and studying whatever bears upon the questions he is called upon to aid in solving. 
He should be a leader, endowed by nature with strong native sense, and at the same 
time able to impart enthusiasm and energy to all with whom he comes in contact. 
2. As to the purposes of rural school supervision: 
(1) It should serve to inspire and stimulate the rural-school teacher. If the 
supervisor is alive to his opportunities, every teacher within the sphere of his 
influence will be quickened and lifted up to higher efforts for the good of the 
school. The teachers should learn to look upon him as a friend, and not as a 
critic; as a wise counselor, and not as a mere fault-finder. 
(2) It should be the means of awakening and stimulating the pupils as well as 
the teacher. They should look for the visits of the supervisor with pleasure, and 
profit by his talks and advice. By instituting a system of central examinations 
for the rural schools, he may quicken and encourage the brighter pupils to 
obtain the best education within their means. The influence of a scholarly 
supervisor over the pupils is a very desirable thing in the rural school. 
(3) The improved condition of the rural schoolhouse is a sure index of the 
work of a competent supervisor. The present lamentable condition of these 
buildings is due largely to ignorance and neglect. Competent supervision in 
skillful hands can work a marvelous change. The cultivation of a spirit of order 
and neatness, which leads to the ornamentation of the school grounds and toa 
watchful care over all the environments of the schoolhouse, is one of the purposes 
of supervision. 
(4) Supervision does not accomplish its legitimate purpose when it fails to 
cultivate a strong, healthy public opinion in favor of everything which tends to 
make a good school. Hence the supervisor who contents himself with a per- 
functory visit to the school only is not a supervisor in the broad sense of that 
word. A large share of the work of the supervisor is away from the school and 
among the people. 
3. As to the results to be expected from intelligent supervision: 
(1) In regard to the school, it unites teachers for a common purpose, and, by 
teachers’ meetings and by the visitations of the supervisor, it breaks up the 
monotony and isolation of the country school. Under its influence better teach- 
ers find their way into the schools, better methods of instruction prevail, and the 
tone and spirit of the school are greatly improved. 
(2) In regard to the community at large, supervision is just beginning to do 
its legitimate work. In the establishment of school libraries, in the relation of 
the supervisor to the directors, in an improved school architecture in which 
due regard is had to sanitary conditions, in the ornamentation and care of the 
school grounds, in school extension, in the introduction of studies which will add 
to the attractiveness and profit of life on the farm, in the consolidation of small 
districts into larger and stronger schools, in awakening a public interest in rural 
education, there is a field large enough to occupy the time and thought of the 
most progressive and most intelligent supervisor. It is here we are to look in the 
near future for the best results of supervision as concerns the rural schools of 
the country.

  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 861 
REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SUPPLY OF TEACHERS. 
The subcommittee on supply of teachers has-distributed a large number of cir- 
cular letters of inquiry, designed to elicit information in regard to the agencies 
now existing for the preparation of teachers for rural schools, and for the improve- 
ment of teachers already in the service, and also in regard to certain conditions, 
as to the manner of certificating, employing, and paying teachers, which affect the 
supply. In connection with this inquiry the attempt has been made to gather infor- 
mation as to the defects and excellencies of existing systems, together with sugges- 
tions for improvement. To these a sufficient number of replies has been received 
to justify the belief that they give a fair average statement of the conditions which 
this report has to meet. Without attempting to summarize the returns, your 
committee would state the results of the inquiry upon the problem presented and 
mark out the lines which must be followed, and to what end, in order that the 
child in the country school may receive the education which is his due. In some 
State systems progress along these lines is much more advanced than in others, 
and in some individual cases the desired end has been attained; but this is true, 
as regards the entire country, in so small a degree that it is unnecessary, even if 
it were possible, to particularize. With but few exceptions the recommendations 
made could be justified by reference to various States or communities in our own 
country, and there are none which do not rest upon successful experiences at home 
or abroad. It will be found quite impossible to treat the rural school in any of 
its aspects without touching in some degree upon ground common to all classes 
of schools, and this is especially true as regards that branch of the problem assigned. 
to this subcommittee. 
Certain conditions now very general must be changed in order that the rural 
school may be supplied with better teachers. 
TEACHERS. 
There must be in rural communities a clearer appreciation of the qualities 
essential to a good teacher. It is too often the case that no distinction is made 
between a teacher of superior scholarship, of proved ability in instruction and 
discipline, of long experience, and one far inferior in all the qualities essential to 
success. 
The teacher must be engaged for the school year. In many cases the engagement 
isfrom term to term, and these frequent changes are, without exception, classed 
among the most potent causes of failure in the rural school. It is widely true that 
the school is in session less than half the year; it is often true that in this short 
school year two teachers are employed, and seldom does a teacher remain a second 
year. Engagements should be for a longer term than one year, or continuous, and 
terminated only for cause, as is the case in many cities. 
One of the most important points to be considered in a system of schools is that 
of the authorities employing teachers and assigning them to their work. In cases 
in which the county or township is the unit of school administration, the problem 
is solved; in case the district system prevails, the district containing one school, 
it is evident that the employment and assignment of teachers should be transferred 
to the authorities of the larger school unit, in order that in the assignment advan- 
tage may be taken of peculiar abilities and aptitudes. 
The authority which examines should not employ. 
Closely allied to this question is one of great interest in the Southern States, 
namely, that of assignment of teachers to negro schools. For a full treatment of 
this subject see Appendix J. 
SCHOOL YEAR. 
The school year must be lengthened to a full school year of nine or ten months, 
In many States a minimum length is prescribed by statute, but in few cases is this
-P-A-G-E-942
  862 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
sufficient. Whatever efforts may be made for the improvement of the rural school, 
until there can be offered a ‘“‘year’s work and a year’s wage” it will be difficult 
and often impossible to retain accomplished teachers for continuous service; with 
this, many such teachers would choose this service from family and social con- 
nections and from a natural preference for rural life. 
In countries in which people are accustomed to the action of centralized author- 
ity prescription settles the matter, as in France, where the school year is more 
than forty weeks; in England, where, as conditions of receiving the Government 
grant, the principal teacher at least must hold the Government certificate of quali- 
fication, the school premises must be in good sanitary condition, the staff, furni- 
ture, and apparatus must be sufficient, and the school must have met four hundred 
times (two hundred days) in the year. 
In countries like our own, in which popular initiative in political matters has 
been the rule, success must usually come by other methods, and in this respect we 
have much to learn from our neighbors. In Canada the schools have been length- 
ened to a full school year mainly under the stimulus given by the mode of dis- 
tributing the Government grants. 
Letters and reports have been received from the different provinces. By these 
it appears that the average length of the school year was in Ontario 212 days; in 
New Brunswick, 216 days; in Nova Scotia, 198.7 days, the full school year being 
216 days and some schools exceeding this limit. A report from Regina, the capital 
of the Northwest Territories, states that the full school year is considered to be 
twelve months, less the holidays, amounting to seven weeks, but this limit can not 
be attained where the sparseness of the population obliges the pupils to travel long 
distances, on account of the severity of the winters.! 
Adding to our plan of requiring a minimum school year the Canadian plan, 
already in a degree recognized in some recent school legislation, of making the 
amount of Government grant depend, in a large degree, upon the length of the 
school year and the average attendance, consolidating schools wherever practica- 
ble, and giving from the larger units of school administration to aid the smaller 
and weaker, the obstacle of the short term and insufficient compensation can be 
removed. 
SUPERVISION. 
Incompetent supervision forms one obstacle to asupply of better teachers. This 
obstacle may be removed by securing professional supervision, as is provided by 
the plan of district supervision so successfully applied in Massachusetts and just 
enacted in Maine. The subcommittee on supervision treats this subject fully. 
It is necessary that more definite tests of professional fitness for the work of 
supervision be instituted. The extension of pedagogical instruction in colleges 
and universities in recent years is gradually elevating the work of supervision to 
a higher pedagogical plane, yet the point has not been reached of demanding pro- 
fessional preparation as an essential condition. For examples of the requirements 
of more definite tests of fitness see Ontario and France (Appendix N), 
It is not unreasonable to hope that in the not distant future the popular stand- 
ard of education may be so raised that on all educational boards of control, from 
the State board down to the county or township school board, so much of peda- 
gogical fitness, from the professional point of view, may be demanded as to insure 
the intelligent consideration of such questions pertaining to the profession as may 
come before them. 
There are various recognized agencies for the improvement of teachers. 
1The subcommittee is under obligation to more than it can name, throughout the United 
States, forinformation. For aid in its inquiries received from the provincial school authorities 
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba, and from Mrs. Etta F. Grover, 
of Regina, Assiniboia, and Mr. Chisholm, principal of the high school in Regina, it would here 
express its thanks.

REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 863 
ASSOCIATIONS, 
The State associations are mainly in the control of teachers representing systems 
| of schools; in but few States are rural school teachers much in evidence at these 
meetings. The fact that in some States the opposite condition holds shows that 
the State association may be made a powerful means of uplifting for the rural 
schools. 
In many of the States vigorous county associations are found, although this is 
by no means universal. In these the rural school receives more recognition, but 
not often all which is its due. When the county association holds frequent ses- 
sions and makes the interests of the rural schools prominent, it proves one of the 
most efficient agencies. 
Some of the States report local associations of rural school teachers which are 
very efficient. Generally the success of these is largely dependent upon the spirit 
of the local or county superintendent. With good professional supervision in. 
township and county, the wants of rural schools and their teachers can find due 
consideration in local and county associations; and by proper organization of rural 
school sections in the State associations there may be secured such an affiliation of 
State, county, and local associations as will insure in time a full recognition of the 
peculiar needs of the rural schools. 
It is desirable that the affiliation between these associations be suchas to secure 
in part the working together, along the same lines of thought, during the same 
years, by the local, county, and State associations, under the inspiration of the 
State department of education. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS OF SEVERAL WEEKS’ DURATION. 
In some cases summer schools are apparently conducted for the purpose of ena- 
bling those attending to pass examinations for certain certificates. The tendency 
is necessarily toward cramming for the examinations, and so far they cease to be 
educative in any proper sense of that term. 
There is another class of summer schools, often held in connection with colleges 
and universities, conducted by able teachers, specialists in their departments, for 
the purpose of advancing education along true lines. Among these, the Agassiz 
School at Penekese, many years ago, was a revelation and an inspiration to the 
teachers of the United States. These schools have multiplied in number and 
enlarged in scope throughout the land, and have proved of great advantage to 
thousands, not only by increasing their knowledge, but also and much more by 
bringing them under the personal influence of leaders of thought and masters in 
teaching. 
A third class, with professional courses in psychology, pedagogy, and methods, 
often combining the character of the second class, preceding, offers great advan- 
tages for professional improvement. There should be in every county one of these 
for the especial benefit of teachers of the common schools; they should be free of 
tuition, organized and conducted under the supervision of the State department 
of education, continuing from four to ten weeks. There should be provision for 
practice teaching, and the instructors should be familiar with rural schools, their 
condition and needs. 
INSTITUTES. 
The normal institutes, so called, organized in some States, especially in the 4 
West, are essentially the same as the third class of summer schools described 
above. 
County institutes of one week or more, held during the school year, may exert a 
great influence in the improvement of teachers. When they are conducted under 
efficient supervision, with a body of instructors capable of increasing the range of 
thought of teachers, and are organized under such laws as will secure the attend- 
 
-P-A-G-E-944
  864 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. . 
ance of the teachers of the county, they prove a powerful means of educational 
advance. 
For the description of such an organization of institutes and results see Appen- 
dix P. 
Teachers’ conventions or institutes of one day, as conferences between teachers, 
or with superintendents, will prove effective to a greater or less degree according 
to the purpose, plan, and mode of conducting. In order to secure the best results, 
they should be held at intervals so frequent that the effect may be continuous. 
READING CIRCLES. 
The success of the Chautauqua movement, of various organizations for home 
study, and of teachers’ reading circles, in some cases, proves that these may be 
made generally efficient. There will be no lack of interest on the part of the 
teachers, if the organization and direction be wise. 
The problem is apparently not a difficult one in the larger places, with systems 
of schools, where numbers of members are readily brought together, but the case 
is quite different in the case of rural schools. The results reported clearly indi- 
cate certain elements essential to success. To secure the advantage of organiza- 
tion there must be a central board of control. This may be a State board with 
auxiliary boards in counties and towns. Not only are books for reading to be 
selected, but a plan of work should be carefully drawn up and widely circulated 
among teachers. The central board should keep in touch with the members of 
the circles, papers based upon the books read should be written and carefully 
examined, and the results attained should in some way be passed to the teacher’s 
credit; thus, for a certain number of certificates indicating the completion of a 
course, a diploma may be granted. 
The plan of organization is perhaps best formed by the teachers of the State 
acting through their associations, and the courses of reading can best be made out 
by the committees chosen by the teachers for this purpose. The work may be 
directed by a committee, but, from comparison of results reported, the varying 
degrees of success, and the many failures, your committee believes it desirable 
that there should be in the State department of education a bureau of teachers’ 
reading circles, with sufficient force to keep in touch with the local circles, to con- 
duct and encourage correspondence with them, and in every way to promote their 
interest and efficiency. 
Effective study demands the use of books for consultation and reference. Hence 
the reading circles should be conducted in conjunction with the lending libraries 
hereafter mentioned. 
The reading circles must be considered as a means of improvement, especially 
for teachers already in the service. No other agency can really take the place of 
personal instruction in the original preparation of a teacher for his work. 
LIBRARIES, 
The country town has suffered, and still suffers, from the lack of books. In many 
States there is now a movement toward the extension of free-library privileges, 
and wherever there is a town library every school should be madea branch. This 
system of library extension, becoming universal in cities, can be extended to coun- 
try as well. By frequent exchange of books, under the immediate direction of 
the teacher as branch librarian, every teacher and pupil will have the use of a 
larger library in addition to the special library which should be found in every 
school. Some books should be added to the library for the special benefit of 
teachers. 
The library belonging to the school is a necessity. Books lent for a time serve 
their purpose, but a love for good books and the ability to use them aright come 
most surely from daily companionship. From the library center the school can

be carried into the home. A more valuable work can hardly be done by the rural- 
school teacher than this, of developing a love for good reading. 
In addition to these, there should be established in the county, or the State, or 
both, a professional library for the use of teachers. This might well be a State 
library with county branches, and the management of it might well be under the 
bureau of reading circles which has been mentioned. Such a State school library 
has been established in New York (Appendix L). 
TEACHERS’ TRAINING CLASSES, 
The agencies thus far treated tend to the improvement of teachers already in 
the service; none of them furnish a first supply for rural schools, and there is a 
lack of special agencies designed for that end. The investigations of your sub- 
committee show that the existing normal schools in general do comparatively 
little in this direction, except by the teaching of their undergraduates. Although 
originally established for the benefit of the common school, they have naturally 
tended to keep step with the development of systems of schools in cities and large 
villages. The majority of rural teachers, often a vast majority, are now without 
any professional preparation whatever. The tendency is strikingly shown in 
returns from the Oswego (N. Y.) Normal School: ‘‘Nine-tenths of our pupils 
come from the country. Not one-tenth ever teach in rural schools.” In one of 
the older States, after many years’ existence of normal schools, of more than 
12,000 teachers in the public schools of all classes less than 5,000 have ever attended 
normal schools, less than 4,000 have graduated from normal schools. Over 1,500 
vacancies occur annually in the schools of the State. The normal schools of the 
State graduate about 300 annually, nearly all of whom become teachers in graded. 
schools. 
One of the leading States of the Union, with a well-organized school system and 
a grand equipment of normal schools aiming directly to train teachers for the 
rural schools, reports that a majority of its teachers have not had professional 
training. Many other States report a much smaller proportion of trained teach- 
ers—one, 8 per cent; another, with one of the best school systems, 30 per cent. 
As a contrast, an answer to the inquiry of your committee, from Manitoba, states: 
“Sixty-six per cent of the teachers employed in the Province in 1895 were trained. 
After this year all will have training.” (See Appendix N.) 
The cause for such a contrast appears later in this report. 
The normal-school system was first devised especially for the benefit of the rural 
schools, and in obedience to a tendency which had become increasingly strong for 
some years previous to the time of their establishment. Some brief passages of 
educational history bearing upon this subject are here cited: 
Tn 1823 Samuel Reed Hall opened a normal school in Concord, Vt., a school for 
the academic and professional education of common-school teachers, with a school 
for practice in teaching. Here Mr. Hall’s lectures on school keeping were delivered 
to his class. These were afterwards published. The character of his work led 
to his being called to the principalship of the English department of Phillips 
Academy at Andover, Mass. He was afterwards invited to take charge of Holmes’s 
Academy, Plymouth, N. H., and consented on condition that the school should be 
called a teachers’ seminary. He opened this teachers’ seminary in 1837 and con- 
tinued it two years. In this school there was a classical department and no prac- 
tice school, but the course, as printed in Appendix K, shows the pedagogical 
character of the institution and the provision made for its students to gain expe- 
rience in teaching. 
In 1829 a training school for teachers of the common schools was opened in the 
town of Effingham, N. H., by Hon. J. W. Bradbury, ex-United States Senator 
from Maine, now living, at more than 90 years of age, in Augusta, Me. By

request, Hon. W. W. Stetson, State superintendent of Maine, recently visited him 
to ascertain the facts in regard to this sehool, and the interview is annexed to this 
report as Appendix K. 
The sole purpose of Horace Mann in the establishment of the first State normal 
school in Massachusetts, a purpose zealously carried out by the principal, Cyrus 
Peirce, was to elevate the common schools of the country. The course of study 
of the normal school was for one year. Im the first year of the school a model 
school was organized, in which normal-school students had daily practice in 
teaching. Mr. Peirce himself taught im the model school, as he felt that upon its 
suecess the success of the normal school very largely depended. Almost all the 
pupils at first came from country towns; almost all returned to teach in coun- 
try schools. There was not then the difference between the rural school and 
the city school which now exists. In 1847 John D. Philbrick began the experi- 
ment of modern grading in Boston, and, with the full development of this system, 
later, the contrast between the school of the country and the school of the town 
became more and more marked, and the rural-school problem appeared. The 
normal-school course, at first simple and adapted to the conditions it was designed 
to meet, developed to keep pace with the developing school system, and gradually 
drew away from the rural schools. 
The normal school is often removed. still further from those who would teach in 
rural schools by the tendency to raise the standard of admission to the require- 
ments of a high-school course. The fact that most of the towns of the State have 
a high school is no proof that all those who will teach rural schools can go 
through a high-school course of three or four years, and then a normal-school 
course of two or three years. Great care should be taken that the normal school 
does not get too far from those whom it was especially set to serve. There is 
needed a more careful determination of the qualities and attainments requisite for 
entrance upon the work of preparation for teaching. These are sometimes 
given in larger measures by the experiences and responsibilities of country life 
than by the graded city high school, and with these every added step in education 
is great gain. So far asraising the standard of admission is in response to a claim 
that all academic studies should be taken out of the normal-school course, it may 
be said that the claim is not universally recognized as valid by those who have 
had most experience of work at home, and can find but little warrant abroad. In 
the normal schools of Prussia, Austria, Switzerland, and France, for example, a 
larger proportion of time is given to academic studies than in many of the normal 
schools of the United States,’, but with directions, certainly in France, that in all 
the course the professional aim shall be constantly kept in view. 
It is evident that for the fitting preparation of teachers for the rural school some 
agency is needed intermediate between the brief convention or institute and the 
normal school, with its two or four years’ course, so far beyond the reach of the 
majority of rural-school teachers. What shall it be? 
Several facts must be kept in mind in the solution of the problem: (1) A large 
proportion of the teachers of rural schools can not afford the time and expense of 
a two-years’ course ina normal school. (2) The receipts from employment in the 
rural school under present conditions do not remunerate one for the expense of a 
normal-school course. This is a simple matter of business, and sentiment will 
not change the facts. (8) Other conditions remaining the same, attendance ata 
school is in an inverse ratio to the distance between school and home. This is 
especially true for a short course. 
To meet these conditions there is needed a normal training school with a short 
course of study. The place is a village which will give over its schools to this

tion, 1892.
-P-A-G-E-947
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 867 
normal training school for practice schools. These practice schools, organ- 
ized as primary schools in one room and as grammar schools in another, will 
show what can be done with schools in the simplest form of gradation. For 
apart of the course all the grades should be brought together to illustrate the 
work of the one-teacher school, such work as should be done in the ungraded 
school. A faculty of five or six good teachers, including practice-school teachers, 
would suffice for such a school. 
This the general organization—what the work? Treatment of matter essential 
50 good teaching would be grounded on simple fundamental principles. Deficien- 
cies in education would be supplemented by sound teaching; principles of teach- 
ing and of school management would be taught and illustrated. Many might 
learn to do well what they had never done at all; most would learn to do better 
what they had done poorly. From these schools would come many students for 
fuller courses of training and a still wider usefulness. 
This plan in its development would give a system of district training schools 
analogous to the county model schools of Ontario and the training schools of 
Quebec and Manitoba, with a course of study and training of one year, the first 
half of which should be mainly academic, for those who need this preparation, 
the second half mainly professional, the work so planned that those of more 
advanced scholarship need take only the course of the second half year. Of these 
schools there should be at least one in every county of the State (Appendix N). 
The practice in teaching should be thoroughly organized. Every teacher in the 
school should be, in a certain sense, a training teacher. He should be responsible 
for the methods of teaching in his own subjects, and should direct lessons given 
by members of his classes to children from the model training schools. Besides 
such lessons illustrative of methods of teaching, the pupil teacher should be 
trained in conducting school work in the schoolrooms under conditions similar to 
those which she will find in her own school. While teaching in the practice 
school under the direction of a teacher in charge, she should be left more and 
more to her own judgment. She should be held responsible for the control and 
direction of the school, and for the teaching of a class, not merely of a group. 
The membership of the class for training should be limited to such numbers as 
will give the full advantage of the training course, or, with a practice school of 
the size presupposed, to about twenty-five. A large class necessitates the teach- 
ing of groups, not of full classes with the control of aschool. The French law 
limits the number of students in each normal school to three classes of twenty- 
five each. 
The practice schools should be under the exclusive instruction and control of 
their regular teachers a sufficient proportion of the time to keep them up to the 
standard of veritable model schools as well. 
The completion of this course should give a teacher’s certificate of elementary 
grade, which would also give admission to the State normal school, with due 
credit on the normal-school course for work already accomplished. 
There should be a summer term for rural-school teachers in every normal school 
in the United States. The plant of the normal school has cost thousands, in 
some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars, and for two or three months in the 
summer this investment remains entirely unproductive. The success of the sum- 
mer term in the University of Chicago is significant, and the Winona plan, 
adopted this year in all the State normal schools of Minnesota, sets the example 
for the nation (Appendix $). In normal schools the work of the first year, or the 
first part of the course, should be so planned as to have a uuity in itself as a prep- 
aration for rural-school teachers, and the results accomplished in the summer 
term should count on this course, so as to encourage subsequent attendance at the 
normal school. The summer term should not be an institute, nor a summer 
school, in the usual sense, but should combine the elements of the other terms of 
 
-P-A-G-E-948
  868 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the year. The attendance of children in the training school could be secured 
easily for two or three hours a day. 
There should be organized in all States a system of normal-school extension 
analogous to the university extension. Wherever a class of sufficient size can be 
formed, a teacher should be provided. The work should be so organized and con- 
ducted as to lead to definite results which can be credited to the members of the 
class. 
There are two possible agencies in the preparation of teachers for rural schools 
that have not been mentioned: 
1. City training schools.—In large cities it is not to be expected that the city 
training school will prepare teachers for rural schools; all their graduates usually 
find employment at home. But cities in this country with a population of more 
than 50,000 are comparatively very few, and it is reasonable to suppose that train- 
ing schools in cities of less than 50,000 will prepare more teachers than can be 
provided with employment in those cities. The surplus will naturally seek posi- 
tions in the village and country schools. 
Birmingham, Ala., a city of about 50,000, has had a training school for eight 
years. During that time 25 per cent of the graduates of this school have found 
employment in the ungraded schools of the county and State. If the training 
school is encouraged, it can be made an important factor in the preparation of 
teachers for rural schools. A part of the course in these schools should, therefore, 
deal with the conditions of the ungraded schoois of the county, and the instruc- 
tion should be specifically adapted to meet those conditions. ; 
2. Agricultural colleges.—Many pupils in agricultural schools and colleges teach 
during their course. In some cases the agricultural college is brought nearer the 
people by the establishment of branches. Thus in Alabama there has been estab- 
lished in each Congressional district a branch agricultural school, closely related 
to the agricultural and mechanical college of the State. Can not such schools 
accomplish much in the specific preparation of teachers for the work of the rural 
schools? 
8. High schools.—An effective auxiliary in the training of elementary teachers 
may be found in high schools. In 1894-95 there were in New York 247 such classes, 
with 2,482 students. The regulations prescribe the professional qualifications of 
the teachers who are to instruct these classes, and the equipment and the oppor- 
tunities for observation and practice to be furnished. The course of study, extend- 
ing through one year, covers the ground of common-school studies, including with 
subject-matter the treatment of methods of teaching, the history of education, 
school management, and school law. The school is to furnish each day the oppor- 
tunity for the class, or some members of it, to observe methods of teaching in the 
several grades of common-school work, and, when practicable, the opportunity to 
teach in such grades under proper criticism and direction. 
A system similar to this is in operation in the Province of Quebec. 
Although these training classes can not take the place nor do the work of 
special training schools, yet they offer a ready means for effecting some imme- 
diate improvement in the teaching force of the State, and for the selection of 
those who have such fitness for teaching as will justify their pursuing a special 
professional course. The teachers of such classes must themselves have received 
thorough pedagogical instruction, else the result must be a failure; hence the 
necessity is apparent for pedagogical courses in all colleges. 
According to the generalizations of the Superintendent of the last census, over 
an area of our country of 1,688,827 square miles, containing a population of 2 to 
45 to the square mile, the occupation of the people is mainly agriculture; of this 
territory 1,096,790 square miles are occupied by a people mainly engaged in syste- 
matic agriculture, leaving about 260,000 square miles, with a population of 45 
and upward to the square mile, in which the leading interests are commerce 
and manufactures, and in which professional and personal service are in large
-P-A-G-E-949
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 869 
demand. The numbers engaged in the principal occupations in the United States. 
according to the latest United States census, were as follows: 
Farm and garden -.- 8,375, 979      All the professions -. -. 944, 323 
Domestic and personal service 4,360, 506 
Trade and transportation -- 8, 325, 962 
Manufacturing and mechanical industries. 5, 091, 669   
In behalf of all these occupations, except the professions and agriculture, the 
claim has been made and has been allowed that special instruction in their inter- 
ests be made an important part of the school curriculum—in commercial courses; 
in cooking; in manual training, on which such vast sums have been expended. 
Indeed, for many of the professions much of the school instruction is a direct 
preparation. 
Much is said of the necessity for considering the environment of the child; for 
bringing into his school life the thoughts and interests of his home life, that the 
school may not prove to him a thing remote and foreign; of making the school a 
recognition of his past and a preparation for his future. Little sign of this can 
be found in the ordinary rural school. 
The courses of study in the normal school of all grades should recognize more 
fully than they do the environment and probable future life of the children in the 
schools, or rather, they should recognize the lines along which lives of most prob- 
able future happiness would lie. As has been shown, much the largest class of 
the workers of this country is engaged in agriculture, The environments of their 
children are rural. The rural school should aim especially to make country life 
more attractive and beautiful, and should pay more attention to rural industries. 
Every normal school should have as a means of instruction a school garden, 
planned and conducted not merely to teach the pure science of botany, but also 
the simple principles of the applied science of agriculture and gardening; and 
every rural school should also have its garden, through which the training of the 
normal school may reach thehome. This element of industrial training should be _ 
especially emphasized in the colored normal schools and rural schoolsof the South, 
Other countries lead us. A farm has been set apart for this line of instruction 
at the Provincial Normal School at Truro, Nova Scotia. The school garden is 
common in the countries of Europe most advanced in popular education. The 
school garden and the nursery of fruit trees are a feature of the normal schools of 
France; there is a course of agriculture in the normal schools for men, of horti- 
culture in the normal schools for women. 
The course in agriculture treats of preparation of the soil, special culture of 
trees and shrubs, of fruit trees, grafting, and the vegetable garden. 
The course in horticulture in the normal schools for women treats of the garden 
in its general arrangements—the fruit garden, the vegetable garden, the flower 
garden. 
Each garden has a space reserved as a botanic garden for instruction in the 
science of botany. 
The instruction received in the normal school is applied in the school garden of 
the rural school.! 
  
1 The school garden in the New Hampshire State Normal and Training School has proved a 
source of interest and of instruction to pupils of all grades in the training schools and in the 
normal schools, such as nothing else can replace. In this garden all the grains and vegetables 
grown in the region were cultivated, together with a great variety of flowers. Each class in 
school had assigned to it a plot, for which it was responsible. In the George Putnam School, in 
Boston, a part of the school yard was turned into a garden, which has received several 
prizes from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. On certain days the Jardin des Plantes 
in Paris is used as a place for botanical study by the school children. I found once on the roof 
of a London schoolhouse, which was used as the girls’ play ground, a large and beautiful collec- 
tion of plants. And yet the rural school almost utterly ignores its only possible laboratory, the 
out of doors, the garden laboratory, right at hand. Here lies a duty, not a choice merely, for 
the normal school.
-P-A-G-E-950
  870 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
A French report says that the French farmer is at first opposed to book farming; 
but when he sees that the products of the teacher’s garden are superior to his own, 
he is glad to learn. 
M. Boutan, an inspector-general of public instruction, says in a report: ‘‘ We 
can cite several departments in which, thanks to the initiative of the teachers, 
the wealth of the country has increased from year to year, and from which the 
exportation of fine fruit has become the source of considerable profit.” 
There can be no doubt that great improvement in agriculture might result from’ 
the general diffusion of such instruction through school gardens, under the direc- 
tion of qualified teachers. Is there any other means for such improvement in 
sight of this generation? And a still higher good for the country life might come 
from thus blending its utilities and its beauties in the thought of the child. 
Your subcommittees would also emphasize the importance of two other lines of 
work already developed in the graded schools, and of a third, which must be made 
prominent in all schools—language, elements of science or nature study, and 
morals. Whatever goes into the common school must go into the normal school. 
Hence, even in the brief course of normal-school training, the instruction in the 
English language, instruction in the essential elements of its beauty and strength, 
instruction leading toward such command of its best forms as will tend to make 
ita transparent medium for the expression of thought, must be held of funda- 
mentalimportance, There must be such training in elementary science and in 
manipulation as will give the teacher essential knowledge and skill in this line of 
teaching, and there must be such instruction in elementary psychology and ethics 
as is necessary for the comprehension of general principles of method, and of the 
scope and methods of instruction in morals; and as result of all the preparation 
which can be given there should bea clear comprehension of the essential aims of 
education. Would that all our teachers could have constantly in mind and at 
hand such a statement as is found on the desks of the common-school teachers of 
France (Appendix R). 
EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS. 
Were teaching a profession in the sense in which law and medicine are profes- 
sions, teachers themselves would formulate the terms of professional recognition; 
but evidently the time for that is not yet. What the public school is immediately 
to aim for is uniformity in State examinations, and we have to consider the 
agencies, the standards, the methods for these examinations. The agency may be 
the State superintendent of public instruction, a special examining board, or a 
State board of education when such board exists. Times and places for examina- 
tion should be announced frequent enough and numerous enough to meet all rea- 
sonabledemand. The scopeand character of the examinations should be announced 
long enough beforehand to enable candidates to consider the matter deliberately, 
as is now done in regard to examinations for admission to college and for the civil 
service. Information as to books for use and as to modes of preparation should be 
given. Each examination should be conducted by an expert, and the papers 
should be critically examined. 
Certificates granted should be graded as to the range of the examination, not as 
to length of validity, unless the certificate be a provisional one. A one-year phy- 
sician would receive little credit; why should a one-year teacher receive more? 
Examinations should cover the range of work required of the teacher, and 
should be written, oral, and practical. The written examination should be 
planned not merely to test the candidate’s range of acquirement, but rather his 
accuracy, his general style of thought and expression. The oral examination 
should test the range of attainment, the personality of the candidate, and his 
readiness in resource. These two are generally combined in one—the written 
form, but there are great advantages in the separation whenever it is practicable.
-P-A-G-E-951
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 871 
The examination for the elementary certificate should cover the ground of 
common-school studies, with so much of the elements of natural science as is 
demanded for the intelligent teaching of the nature lessons in the common-school 
course. The questions should be few, but comprehensive, and such as will fairly 
test the reflective power of the candidate. 
The professional examination for the elementary grade of certificate should not 
be severe, but should require clear general statements regarding methods of con- 
ducting recitations and the organization and management of a school. 
The practical examination, or the test of skill, for the elementary grade of cer- 
tificate, should include some test of the candidate's ability to plan a lesson and an 
examination paper in some common-school subject, and to conduct a recitation. 
If the candidate has been a member of a class in training, a record of this practi- 
eal work might be brought over from the work in that class. 
So much ability as is implied by this examination is necessary to the good teach- 
ing of any school. Wherever this ability can not be secured now for the rural 
school, a clear public appreciation of the need will lead to a supply of the means. 
The examination for the advanced certificate should in general cover the 
ground of an English high-school course of at least three years, or fair equiva- 
lents for such acourse. A special certificate might be given for a foreign lan- 
guage. This examination should include psychology and ethics, drawing, and the 
elements of vocal music. 
The professional examination for the advanced certificate should include his- 
tory of education, methods of teaching, general principles of pedagogy, and the 
organization and management of schools. 
The practical examination should include the preparation of plans of lessons 
and of examinations; judging the character of a lesson and a written paper; 
teaching, including an oral lesson on some subject in nature study, elements of 
science, language, or morals. 
As in the examination for the elementary certificate, if the candidate is a mem- 
ber of any training class, the practical examination can be taken in that class. 
Formulating the preceding statements, the teachers’ certificates should be 
graded in two general classes, elementary and advanced, and in each class three 
grades. 
ELEMENTARY: 
(1) Elementary scholastic certificate, grade 3. 
(2) Elementary professional certificate, grade 2. 
(3) Elementary certificate of skill, grade 1. 
ADVANCED: 
(1) Advanced scholastic certificate, grade 3. 
(2) Advanced professional certificate, grade 2.. 
(8) Advanced certificate of skill, grade 1. 
A life certificate of either class and honorable recognition in the profession 
should be granted after a certain period of successful teaching to those holding 
the first-grade certificate of that class. 
In each class the higher certificate presupposes the lower; thus grade 1 can not 
be obtained without 3 and 2. 
Many, if not most, of the examinations of teachers for rural schools in the 
United States to-day do not go beyond the range of the elementary certificate, 
grade 8, as here given; the elementary certificate, grade 2, could be obtained by 
attendance upon a teachers’ training class in a high school. A course in a dis- 
trict training school organized as described in this report, or a partial course of 
one year ina State normal school, should give the complete elementary certifi- 
cate. In many cases thoughtful and successful teachers in the rural school, by 
their own study and the help afforded by a well-conducted reading circle and a r
-P-A-G-E-952
  872 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1896-97. 
normal extension course, could rise from the elementary certificate, grade 3, to 
the complete elementary certificate. A high-school course would give advanced 
certificate, grade 3, and, with the course in a high-school teachers’ training class, 
might give advanced certificate, grade 2. The complete advanced certificate 
could be obtained by a two-years course in a normal school. 
This gradation of examinations and certificates will utilize to the utmost the 
existing educational agencies, will point out to teachers a way in which they may 
rise step by step, and will thus encourage their advance, and will secure to the 
rural school the benefit of their improvement. 
A question will arise as to the interval between the elementary and the advanced 
certificate. (For a wider interval established in Manitoba see Appendix N.) In 
many cases it may be best to lower the standard of the advanced certificate and 
make it intermediate between the elementary certificate and the normal-school 
diploma attesting the completion of a two years’ course. On this question your 
subcommittee pronounces no opinion. It would point out a way by which the 
teachers of the rural school as it now is may be taken as they are and induced to 
enter upon a course of advanced study,and by which the school may derive all 
possible benefit from the advance; and your subcommittee believes that by sucha 
course standards will gradually be raised all along the line. 
Your subcommittee on the supply of teachers for rural schools, in closing its 
report, would call attention to some of the main points in this discussion. 
It appears that there are numerous agencies which may be made available for 
the improvement of rural-school teachers already in the service. With these the 
only question is that of more perfect organization. 
Although there is in general an increase in interest in educational questions and 
an elevation of standards of teaching, yet the large majority of rural-school 
teachers now enter upon their work with no professional preparation; the 
improvement in the character of rural schools, where there has been any improve- 
ment, has been slow; large sections of the country report no advance; some report 
a decline. 
The causes for this condition and the changes needed are not far to seek: 
1. Theschool year must be lengthened to a full school year of nine or ten months, 
in order that skilled teachers may be retained. This result can be secured, as it 
has been secured elsewhere when its absolute necessity has been recognized. The 
State, among other conditions for payment from the school fund, may prescribe a 
full school year, which is done in England, as logically as six, or seven, or eight 
months, now done in some of our States; or it may secure this result, as it has 
been secured in Canada, by making the length of the school so prominent a condi- 
tion in the distribution of the school fund as to insure the cooperation of the 
county and the town to this end. 
2. The existing agencies for the supply of teachers for rural schools do not suffice. 
There must be modifications in these and the provision of others. 
3. There must be some defirtite standard for the certification of teachers, coming 
within reach of the teacher of the rural school, and encouraging advance to such 
higher degrees of attainment and skill as will give full professional recognition. 
And your committee believes that some provision should be made to secure inter- 
state recognition. - 
The question of finance does not lie within the province of this subcommittee, 
but it does not believe that the financial difficulty need prevent the necessary 
reform. When there is once full recognition by the State of its final responsi- 
bility for the education of every child within its borders, there will be possible 
such an adjustment of expenses between it and the lower educational units as will 
be burdensome to none and just to all. 
Your subcommittee has sought to ascertain accurately what the rural school 
now is; in all its suggestions it has had in view the rural school as it ought to be.

REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INSTRUCTION AND DISCIPLINE. 
Your subcommittee on course of study, methods of instruction, and disciplinein 
rural schools begs leave to report herewith that it has carefully considered the con- 
ditions which prevail in thinly settled districts with the intent to discover the evils 
that exist in the schools as a consequence of those conditions, such, for example, 
as (1) the want of classification and (2) the impossibility of thorough instruction 
on the part of the teacher, as well as (3) the lack of that stimulus which comes to 
the pupil from working at reasonable tasks in company with his equals. Your 
committee has hereinafter described and discussed various remedies, which it 
believes will have useful results in practice. 
About one-half of all the teachers in the United States teach what are called 
ungraded schools. They receive in one room pupils of all ages and all degrees of 
advancement from A B C’s upward, sometimes even to algebra and Latin. In 
extreme cases each pupil is a class by himself in all branches, except perhaps read- 
ing, writing, and spelling. It quite often happens that there is no uniformity of 
text-books, each pupil having a different edition or different author; the teacher 
is often obliged to borrow the pupil’s book when he hears him recite. 
According to Mr, Hinsdale’s studies of the United States census (see Appendix A), 
the sparsely settled region of the country includes, first, one-third of the whole 
domain entirely uninhabited or containing fewer than 2 inhabitants per square 
mile; secondly, an area of 1,688,827 miles with from 2 to 45 inhabitants per square 
mile, leaving only 260,000 square miles containing more than 45 to the square mile, 
and the 443 cities with an aggregate of nearly 19,000,000 people. 
It happens that ungraded rural schools with a very small attendance are to be 
found even in the most thickly peopled States and often in proximity to cities, 
Rhode Island in 1895 reports 158 out of its 263 schools as ungraded and 64 of them 
as containing fewer than 10 pupils each; 3 towns have in the aggregate 39 schools 
averaging fewer than 10 pupils. Vermont in 1893 reported 153 schools with 6 
pupils or less each. Massachusetts in 1893-94 reported 16 towns with an aggre- 
gate of nearly 100 schools with an average of 11 pupils. New York in 1894-95 
reported 2,983 schools with fewer than 10 pupils each and 7,529 with less than 20. 
Other examples are mentioned in the report of the subcommittee on maintenance. 
A school with 10 pupils of ages from 5 to 15 years, of different degrees of 
advancement, some beginning to learn their letters, others advanced from one to 
eight or nine years in the course of study, can not be graded or classified to advan- 
tage, but must for the most part be taught individually. The beginner who does 
not yet“know a letter should not be placed in a class with another who began last 
year and can now read lessons in the middle of the primer. It will not do to place 
in the same class a boy beginning numeration and another one who has already 
mastered the multiplication table. The beginner in grammar has not yet learned 
the technique, and is confused and discouraged by the instruction given to another 
pupil in his class who has already learned the declensions and conjugations. 
Any attempt, in short, to instruct two or more pupils in a class when there is a 
difference of a year’s work in their advancement results in humiliating and dis- 
couraging the less advanced and in making the maturer pupils conceited. Higher 
learning in the possession of a fellow-man seems to an illiterate person as some-
-P-A-G-E-954
  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
thing magical, or bordering on the miraculous; he can make combinations of 
thought which surprise those who are unusedtothem. The case is worse with the 
child in school. To him the elevation given by a year’s study seems an endowment 
of nature and not aresult of industry. Permanentinjury tothe pupilsis very often 
occasioned by wrong classification, for not only does the lower suffer from dis- 
couragement, but the higher pupil is necessarily injured by not being held to his 
best. The teacher is perforce obliged to adapt the lesson to the average of the 
class. This does not give enough work for the advanced pupil, although it gives 
too much for those below the average. Thereis not enough demand upon the first 
to continue the increase of his powers; he becomes indolent and stops growing. 
For these reasons classification as above described ought not to be expected in 
the rural school; it must remain ungraded, and as a result the teacher must resort 
to individual instruction wherever there are intervals of a year or more in degrees 
of advancement between pupils, and this is the actual practice in perhaps the 
majority of such schools. The older pupils at least should have separate gram- 
mar, history, and arithmetic lessons. 
It is understood by your subcommittee, as a matter of course, that even ina 
small school of six to ten pupils there may be two or more pupils of sufficiently 
near stages of progress to form one class—for example, two beginners in arithme- 
tic, grammar, geography, or history. It may be that a dull pupil has already 
been studying arithmetic, grammar, or history for a quarter or a half year, and 
that a bright pupil just commencing the study would be able to keep up with him 
on a review from the beginning of the book; but it would not do to place a dull 
pupil commencing a study with a bright one who had already a half year’s start 
init. It often happens that pupils placed in the same class at the beginning of 
the year separate widely in power to learn new lessons before the middle of the 
year. In such cases a class should be broken up to prevent the twofold injury, 
namely, to the bright pupil by assigning him too short lessons, and to the dull 
pupil by assigning him more than he can well accomplish. 
The teacher, even after forming classes in writing, reading, and spelling, has 
twelve to fifteen lessons to hear in a forenoon and nearly as many more for the 
afternoon. There is an average of less than ten minutes for each recitation. The 
ideal of the recitation or class exercise is that the teacher probe to the bottom the 
pupil’s preparation of his lesson and correct bad habits of study. If the pupil 
fails to master by sufficient industry the details—the facts and external items— 
the teacher counsels and reproves, requiring more work on the samelesson. If he 
finds that the details are mastered, the teacher next tests the combinations, the 
thoughts that the pupil has used in connecting one fact with another and in see- 
ing relations. Facts are connected so as to form a science when each one is made 
to throw light on every other fact and all explain each. So a lesson is learned 
properly when the pupil can place each item in its systematic relation tothe whole. 
He must understand the bearings of all. He must think out the interrelations. 
Hence it happens that the good teacher is not satisfied with a memoriter recita- 
tion of the details of the lesson—still less with a word-for-word rendition of the 
text-book. Not the mere words of the book, nor even the disconnected facts or 
details which the words indicate, but to bring out the thought which unites these 
details and explains them is the main object of the good recitation. But such a 
recitation requires time. The teacher can not probe the pupil’s knowledge in five 
minutes and correct his bad habits of study—nor inten minutes. In the necessa- 
rily brief recitation of the ungraded school there is barely time to test the pupil’s 
mastery of the external details of the lesson, the mere facts and technical words. 
It is for this reason. more especially that the rural school has been the parent of 
poor methods of instruction—of parrot memorizing and of learning words instead 
of things. : 
' At the beginning of this century only one-thirtieth of the inhabitants of the
-P-A-G-E-955
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 875 
United States lived in towns of 8,000 peopie or upward, and more than £0 per 
per cent of all the public schools were ungraded schools. The question has often 
been asked how it is that so many able men who became scholars and statesmen 
and professional men of eminence could have come from schools as poor as the 
rural school is said to be. Such eminent men as were produced in those times 
came from the rural school; there were few graduates from graded schools to com- 
pete with them. Of the men now living, past the middle age of life, nearly all 
received their early education in the rural ungraded school, because even as late 
as 1850 at least 80 per cent of all the public schools were ungraded, there being only 
124 per cent of the population resident in cities. The rural school threw on the 
pupil the burden of his education. He was obliged to get his knowledge from 
books, such books as he could come to possess. Bright pupils do pretty well by 
themselves if given good books and taught how to read and to understand the 
technique used in the elementary books of mathematics, grammar, and the other 
liberal arts. Any country boy who acquires a love for books, who has access to 
the best ones, and studies them with energy will by middle age become a learned 
man. 
In the ideal classified school the teacher has two classes of pupils, each class 
containing within it pupils substantially at the same stageof advancement. The 
pupils of a-given class recite together in all the branches, and the teacher has a 
half hour for a lesson and can go into the dynamics or casual relations of the facts 
and events treated. 
Each pupil in a class learns as much from his fellow-pupils as from the teacher 
direct; for the teacher draws out of the class its store of observations and reflec- 
tions on the topic of the lesson. He shows up the one-sidedness of the prepara- 
_ tion of the individual pupil; some have neglected this point and some that other 
point. Each has probably neglected something. But, on the other hand, each of 
the diligent ones has brought forward something new that is valuable to his fel- 
lows. Each pupil finds through the recitation of the others that they have seen 
some things that had escaped his notice, although he supposed that he understood 
thoroughly the book presentation of the subject. His teacher suggests many 
new ideas and criticises the one-sidedness of the views of the pupils and also, it 
may be, of the text-book. All the statements of the book are brought to the test 
of verification—either through the child’s experience or through other authorities. 
The child thus learns the method of study. 
The ideal classified school can teach and does teach proper methods of study; 
the rural school can not do this effectively in its five or ten minute recitations. It 
is because of this that wise directors of education have desired the consolidation of 
small schools into large schools whereyer practicable. Two schools of ten each 
furnish on an average one-half as many recitations if united as they do when sepa- 
rate, owing to the possibility of pairing or classifying pupils of the same degree of 
advancement. Ten such schools united into one will give 100 pupils, with a possi- 
bility of classes of ten each, which can be more efficiently taught than before, 
because the pupil can learn more in a class than by himself, The class in the 
hands of a good teacher is a potent instrument for reaching all sides of the pupil’s 
observation and reflection. Again, it is evident that five teachers can teach the 
100 pupils united in one school far better than the ten teachers were able to teach 
them in the ten separate schools. If still further consolidation were possible and 
400 pupils were united in one school, the classification might be improved to such a 
degree that a teacher could easily take the charge of two classes of twenty pupils, 
and ten teachers could do far better work for each pupil than was done by the forty 
teachers in the forty small rural schools before consolidation. Hence, economy 
becomes a great item in what are called ‘‘ union schools.” 
Your subcommittee, in this discussion of the advantages of classifying and the 
corresponding disadvantages of the want of classifying, has assumed that as good
-P-A-G-E-956
  876 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
teachers are supplied to the rural schools as to the schools of villages and cities— 
teachers of experience and skill, teachers of thorough academic and professional 
training in normal schools. It is assumed that States have made provision for 
good salaries in these ungraded schools and that the license to teach requires pro- 
fessional training. 
It is admitted as a fact, however, that the average rural-school teacher receives 
a small salary—not more than one-half that of the teacher in the city or large vil- 
lage. It is true, as reported by the subcommittee on maintenance of schools, that 
some States, notably California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and 
others to a greater or less degree, are providing, by a wise distribution of school 
money, to secure skillful teachers for these small, ungraded schools. But the evils 
above described as appertaining to instruction in ungraded schools are of such a 
character as not to yield to ordinary remedies. 
Your subcommittee would call special attention at this point to the evil results 
that come from the attempt to remedy the defects of the rural school by forcing 
on it the system of classification found in cities, It is assumed that some of the 
_ benefits of the close grading possible in cities will be gained for the rural schools 
if they can roughly group the whole school into three or four classes. A rural 
school of thirty pupils, comprising children from 6 to 16 years of age and covering 
different degrees of progress, from beginners up to those of eight or nine years of 
schooling, are grouped, let us suppose, into four classes or grades, thus leaving 
intervals of two or more years of school work betwee2 a given group and the 
next one above it. 
Your subcommittee has already pointed out the evils of classifying pupils in 
such a way as to bring together pupils differing in degree of advancement by 
intervals of two years. In fact, it has been found in city schools that one year’s 
interval between classes is too much. The greatest danger of the graded-school 
system in cities comes from holding back bright pupils for the sake of the slower 
and duller pupils. Next to this is the evil to the dull ones, who are dragged for- 
ward at an unnatural rate of progress to keep up to the average rate of the class. 
The best pupils are engaged in ‘‘marking time,” while the slowest are constantly 
spurred forward by teachers and parents to keep with their class, and their school 
years rendered miserable. Their self-respect is undermined by a false standard, 
that of mere speed in learning. The ‘‘marking time” injures the bright pupil by 
developing lax habits of study, while the forced marches of the slow pupil tend to 
destroy his poise of character. It has been found desirable, therefore, in city 
schools, to make the intervals between classes as small as possible, so as to favor 
frequent transfers, namely, on the one hand, of bright pupils who are becoming 
capable of a greater amount of work into a higher class, and, if necessary, of those 
who are falling behind tho average of the class into the next one below. Intervals 
of a half year are, therefore, adopted in a majority of the progressive city school 
systems, and many prefer intervals of a quarter of a year where it is practicable 
to make them, that is, where a large number of pupils makes possible the assign 
ment of a requisite quota for each class. At the request of the subcommittee, Dr. 
E, E. White, an eminent authority on all that relates to school management, has 
furnished a statement of his views of classification in the rural school, illustrat- 
ing them by a programme, which allows twenty-five minutes for each recitation. 
But the intervals between the classes amount to two years’ work, and inasmuch 
as he expressly provides for capable pupils, letting them ‘‘ work ahead of their 
classes,” he leaves the question where it is left by the subcommittee, unless the 
pupils are supposed to do their ‘‘advance work” without the teacher’s supervision. 
(Appendix I.) 
Your subcommittee would respectfully call attention to the danger of attempt- 
ing to classify the rural school in imitation of the city school as peculiarly liable 
to happen in those schools where professionally educated teachers are employed,
-P-A-G-E-957
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS, 877 
The State and city normal schools have very properly laid stress on grading and. 
classification, and on the methods of instruction by classes, and have ignored indi- 
vidual instruction. Their graduates have mostly sought and obtained places in 
the graded schools of cities and villages. In fact, the graded schools have outbid 
the rural schools for teachers having professional training. But, with the new 
movement to secure better teachers for rural schools by larger appropriationsfrom 
the State, it has happened that many experiments of classification are attempted 
which result disastrously in the manner described, namely, by demoralizing or 
destroying the courage and ambition of the exceptionally bright and the excep- 
tionally dull pupils. The charge has been made that such rural schools as adopt 
a partial grading system are apt to become stiflers of talent by placing a premium 
on the average scholars and holding back the promising youth of the district. 
It is obvious from this that where State normal schools furnish teachers for the 
rural districts there should be conducted a special inquiry into the intiuence of 
the size of the school in determining the uses and the dangers of grading and 
classifying pupils. bs 
There is no doubt, moreover, that the abuse of classification is the crying evil | 
of the schools of villages and small cities. For the average pupil these village 
graded schools are uniformly good, but they often work injury to the exceptional 
pupils and are in this respect sometimes inferior to the ungraded schools in sparsely- 
settled districts. 
Your subcommittee would here explain that the technical terms ‘“ grading” and 
“classification” are often used, as above, to signify the same thing, namely, the 
dividing of the pupils of a school into groups or classes, each containing children 
of the same, or substantially the same, degree of advancement. But another 
meaning is often given to one of these terms. The work of the year, more or less, 
is also called the work of a grade, and the work of the elementary school, consist- 
ing of the first eight years’ work, is divided into eight grades. It will be readily 
understood in this second use of the word “ grade” as covering a year’s work that 
a school may be graded, that is to say, its workmay be arranged upon a programme 
of eight grades, each one of which requires a certain modicum of reading, writing, 
arithmetic, geography, grammar, etc., for a year’s work, and yet have only ten or 
twenty pupils, and perhaps these representing only three or four of the eight 
grades. 
By a graded school, as applied to such a state of things, is meant simply a school 
whose programme requires a regular sequence of studies and a full quota of 
studies for each pupil. If a pupil is at acertain degree of advancement in his 
arithmetic, the programme of the graded system would place him also in a class 
correspondingly advanced in geography, history, reading, or other studies. But 
the small rural school has been called ‘‘ungraded” because it contains or may 
contain pupils of all grades, from the lowest to the highest, and consequently 
obliges the teacher to scatter his teaching force over a wide range of topics. The 
large school permits specializing by dividing the school in such a way that the 
pupils. of one grade, or perhaps two grades, are taught by one teacher, the next 
one or two grades by another teacher, etc., permitting each teacher to specialize 
his work by giving him fewer topics to teach, and consequently insuring longer 
recitation periods and constant improvement in skill. 
It is to be supposed that all schools will be graded in the sense that they will 
have a course of study, and that pupils will take up their branches of study in 
due order, and that these studies will be associated, so that a given degree of 
advancement in one study implies a given degree of advancement in another. 
What is properly called the correlation of studies presupposes that a certain 
degree of advancement in arithmetic corresponds to a certain degree of advance- 
ment in geography, reading, grammar, and other studies, all of these being deter- 
mined within limits by the pupil’s age. The word “grading,” as a synonym for  
-P-A-G-E-958
  878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
classification, is freely used by your subcommittee in this report, but it has dis. 
cussed the topic indicated in the other and less frequent use of the word “‘grading” 
in that part of its report which follows, relating to the course of study. 
THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
Your subcommittee has assumed that the course of study in the rural schools 
should be substantially the same as that of the city schools. The differences 
should concern only minor details. It would, therefore, refer here to the report 
of the committee of fifteen for fuller details, and for the discussion of the grounds 
for selecting the several branches of the course of study. The course of study of 
the elementary school, whether urban or rural, should contain those branches 
which give the child an insight into the physical world and the means of conquer- 
ing it for human uses, and also an insight into human nature and the motives 
that control the actions of men. The child should above all be taught how to 
combine with his fellows to secure reasonable ends.« The windows of the soul are 
to be opened by the five branches of the course of study, thus enabling the youth 
to see (1) the conditions of inorganic nature by arithmetic and the elements of 
physics and chemistry; (2) the conditions of organic nature by studying plants 
and animals, the land, water, and air, and, besides these, the means that man 
invents and uses to connect each place with the rest of the world—these things 
belonging to geography. These two “ windows” look out upon nature. The three 
others enable us to see man; (3) literature and art as revealing human nature, 
arousing pure and high aspirations in the youth, and freeing him from narrow 
and mean views of life; (4) the study of the structure of language, as found in 
the several subdivisions of grammar and rhetoric; (5) history, which treats of the 
greater self—of man as a social whole. 
These five branches belong to all schools, for they relate to the substance of 
humanity and are necessary for entrance upon civilization. Besides arithmetic, 
geography, literature, grammar, and history, there are collateral branches that 
each school should include—some of them information studies, such as oral courses 
in the sciences, in history, and in the arts—others of the nature of disciplines, or 
arts of skill, such as vocal music, gymnastics, manual training, the art of cooking, 
and some special attention to the elementary principles of the useful arts practiced 
in the neighborhood of the school, namely, farming, horticulture, grazing, mining, 
manufacturing, or the like (Appendices G and H). 
In general these collateral branches should relate to the pupil’s environment and 
help him understand the natural features of that environment, as well as the 
occupations of his fellow-men in the neighborhood. There are two things to 
understand in this matter of the geography of the environment. First, what it is 
and how it came to be—its land and water, its mountains and river valleys, its 
climate and soil, its productions, mineral, vegetable, and animal, and their pecul- 
iarities, how they differ from the productions of the rest of the world. Second, 
the means by which man procures from nature what is useful for himself and 
others, manufactures if and uses it, or exchanges it with his fellow-men so as to 
share in the productions of all climes and places, no matter how far distant. Ifa 
comparison must be made, this second topic of elementary geography is more 
important than the study of the natural features of the environment, because it 
is more immediately useful to the pupil and to the community in which he lives. 
Let the pupil beginning the subject of geography commence with what is near- 
est to his personal and social interests, namely, with the products of the industries 
of his section. Let his studies go out from these products in two directions; first, 
to the natural conditions which make these products possible and which furnish in 
general the raw material; secondly, in the direction of the purpose of this, the uses 
made of it, the things produced, the needs and wants of his fellow-men near and
-P-A-G-E-959
  
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 879 
far; and the productions of the other parts of the world which are needed in his 
section to complete the supply of articles for food, clothing, shelter, protection, 
and culture. These items, including natural production and the human occupa- 
tions of manufacture and exchange, may be said to be the chief theme of geography 
as it should be taught in the elementary schools. But the home environment is 
also to be kept in mind by the teacher throughout the entire course. Arithmetic 
should gain concreteness of application by its use in dealing with home problems. 
Literature should be pointed and applied, so far as may be without becoming pro- 
vincial, to the pupil’s environment; and so the other branches history, and even 
grammar—should be brought home to the pupil’s knowledge or experience in the 
same way. The pupil should have prepared for his study a list of the chief pro- 
vincialisms of speech to which his section is addicted, and to the peculiarities of 
pronunciation in which his neighborhood departs from the national or interna- 
tional standard of usage. 
The committee of fifteen has already advanced the opinion that the industrial 
and commercial idea is the central idea in the study of geography in the elemen- 
tary schools. It leads directly to the natural elements of difference in climate, soil, 
productions, races of men, religion, political status, and occupation of the inhab- 
itants, and it explains how these differences have arisen in some measure through 
cosmic and geological influences. It should be the teacher’s object to make the 
pupil understand, just as early as his growing capacity admits, the peculiarities 
of his habitat, leading him to study the land and water formations in his neigh- 
porhood, and giving him power to recognize in the visible landscape about him 
the invisible forces that worked in the past, and still are at work in the resent, 
molding these shapes and forms. On the basis of this knowledge of the elements 
of difference produced by nature in soil, climate, and configuration of the land- 
scape, he should explain the grounds and reasons for the counter process of civil- 
ization which struggles to overcome these differences by bridging the rivers and 
tunneling the mountains—by using steamboat and railroad so as to unite each 
particular habitat with the rest of the world. He should see how man adapts to 
his needs the climate of each place by creating for himself a comfortable temper- 
ature, using for this purpose clothing and shelter, as well as fuels of wood and 
coal or derived from oils and gases, to protect from cold, and on the other hand 
utilizing ice or power fans, and creating easy access to summer dwellings on the 
heights of mountains or at the seashore, to mitigate the heat. He turns the soil 
into a laboratory, correcting its lacks and deficiencies by adding what is necessary 
to produce the crop which he desires. He naturalizes the useful plants and ani- 
mals of all climes in his own habitat. It is evident that the details of the process 
by which differences of soil, climate, and produetion arise, important as these are, 
should not be allowed to occupy so much of the pupil’s time that he neglects to 
study the counter process of industry and commerce by which man unites all parts 
of the carth to his habitat, and progressively overcomes the obstacles to civilization 
by making climate and soil to suit himself wherever he wishes. 
To restate this important point in a word, it is true that the deeper inquiry into 
the process of continent formation, the physical struggle between the process of 
the upheaving or upbuilding of continents, and that of their obliteration by air 
and water; the explanation of the mountains, valleys and plains, islands, volcanic 
action, the winds, the rain distribution, is indispensable to a comprehension of 
the physicalenvironment. But the study of the cities, their location, the purposes 
they serve as collecting, manufacturing, and distributing centers, leads most 
directly to the immediate purpose of geography in the elementary school, for it is 
the study of that civilization in which the pupil lives and moves and has his being. 
Keeping this human standpoint in view all the time as a permanent interest, 
the inquiry into causes and conditions should proceed concentrically from the 
pupil’s use of food and clothing to the sources of the raw materials, the. methods 
 
-P-A-G-E-960
880 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of their production, and the climatic, geologic, and other reasons that explain 
their location and their growth. It is important in this as in all matters of school 
instruction to avoid one-sidedness. Although the human factor should receive 
the most emphasis, special care should be exercised lest the nature factor should 
be neglected. 
Your subcommittee would refer to the discussion of this subject under the head 
of ‘‘Geography ” in the report of the committee of fifteen for further illustration. 
There is not much use in requiring instruction in branches not yet reduced to 
pedagogic form. It is necessary that matters taught should be so systematized 
for school use as to admit of arrangement in a progressive series of lessons, the 
first of which alone would be useful if no second lesson followed, and the subse- 
quent lessons each useful if the pupil studied none of the following. 
Each lesson when arranged in a pedagogic form leads up to the following lesson 
and makes it easy to grasp, just as each stair makes the next one easy to climb. 
For example, the first lesson in cookery is an exercise in accurate measurement 
by spoonfuls and cupfuls, etc., and calculated not only to aid in the next lesson 
and make it possible, but also to be of use through life in the kitchen. Concerted 
efforts are being made in agricultural colleges to reduce to pedagogic form the 
arts of the farm, the garden, and the forest. 
THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES, 
Your subcommittee deems it important to call attention again in this place to 
the prevalence of a misconception in regard to the relation of the course of 
study to the system of grading and classification. Every school, whether ungraded 
or graded, should have a course of study minutely arranged, so as to show the 
average or reasonable rate of progress of the pupil of a given age and advance- 
ment in the work of the school; but, as has already been shown, it is not required 
that the school shall contain classes in each and all of these grades, nor, indeed, 
classes at any given stage of progress in the course of study as laid down for any 
particular quarter or term of the year. Above all, it must be understood that in 
laying down the quarters or other divisions of a grade or year’s work it is not to 
be expected or desired that the pupils entering school at the beginning of the 
school year in the fall should commence at the beginning of any grade’s work. If 
aclass consisting of two or more individuals (or of one individual only) left off the 
previous year in the third quarter’s work of the fourth grade, it should begin its 
work after vacation at the point where it left off, unless there are special reasons 
which require a review of some portions of the work. 
The course of study is the measuring rod.or scale which is used to determine at 
what point in the eight years’ work of the elementary course a pupil has arrived. 
It should not be used as the Procrustean bed on which to stretch the work of the 
school in order to give it uniformity. It has happened not infrequently in the 
past that upon the first adoption of the graded system the superintendent of city 
schools held annual examinations on the completion of the work of the grade, and 
for this purpose insisted upon the unreasonable requirement that all of the pupils 
in the school should have begun the work of a grade on the first day of the year 
and should be expected to finish the grade work in the fourth quarter of the year. 
This was said to be for convenience of promotion—all pupils leaving the work of 
one grade and passing to the next were said to be promoted. This fiction has 
effected serious injuries in city schools. The apparent reason for such a system 
was the convenience of the superintendent who desired to make only one set of 
questions for each grade, and hold his examinations all at one time. If he had 
adopted a plan of preparing an examination for any class of pupils at the time 
when they should have completed the work of the grade (whether in the first, sec- 
ond, third, or fourth quarter), such a system need not have existed. The false
-P-A-G-E-961
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 881 
idea of promotion has also been the source of great evils. When a pupil has fin- 
ished the work laid down in the course of study for any grade, he should begin 
the work of the succeeding grade at once, and it is not necessary to have any spe- 
cial examination. The class teacher is supposed to examine her pupils from day 
to day, for each recitation is an examination revealing the pupil’s understanding 
not only of the day’s work but of his previous lessons; and the principal of the 
school is supposed to be well acquainted with the progress of his pupils. It is not 
necessary, therefore, to hold a general examination on the work of the grade if the 
class teacher and the supervising principal have performed their duty. 
Itis understood, too, that there should be much written work in the school, but 
that it should not asa rule take the form of competitive examinations. There is 
no other exercise in the school more valuable than that of written expression, but 
this should be limited chiefly to the review work of the pupil. The teacher, for 
illustration, should prepare questions at the close of the week on the previous 
five or six days’ work, such questions as bring out the most essential points and 
the principles which connect the details that have been studied. The pupil should 
be permitted to sit down by himself with plenty of time before him to write out 
his answers to these probing questions. By this means he learns gradually to 
collect his thoughts, and will do more thinking in connection with his written 
examination than in any other test or study in his school course. The written 
examination should not be postponed till the end of the year or to the end of the 
quarter, but should be a matter of at least weekly occurrence. It should be 
written work of a review character rather than examination of a competitive 
character, 
While the course of study for the elementary school will cover eight years and 
be subdivided so as to show quarterly, semiannual, or other stated progress, as 
already said, it will not be expected that the rural school with its 10 or 20 
pupils will have each and every grade represented; perhaps, for instance, there 
will be three pupils in the first grade, two in the second grade, one in the third 
grade, none in the fourth grade, two in the fifth grade, none in the sixth and 
seventh, and two in the eighth grade. 
Your subcommittee assumes likewise that the discipline of the rural school 
should be strict though mild, like that of the city school. The fundamental - 
school virtues of regularity, punctuality, and industry are auxiliary to moral 
virtues and form together a training of the will which is of great importance in 
producing the future good citizen. It must not be thought that, because a school 
is small, therefore the discipline is of less importance. The formation of habits 
of order and of respect for the rights of the social whole is necessary for the 
good citizen, whether of country or town. 
REMEDIES FOR THE EVILS OF THE RURAL SCHOOL, 
Your subcommittee would here point out that some of the evils of the rural 
school are due to its nonsocial character, its inability to furnish to each of its 
pupils that educative influence that comes from association with numbers of the 
same age and the same degree of advancement. The rural school furnishes only 
a few companions to the youth, and those either above him or below him in grade 
of progress in studies. The remedy for the evils of the ungraded school are sug- 
gested by this very feature or characteristic. Radical remedies in this case must 
all contain some device to bring together pupils of different districts and bring 
into wholesome competition with one another the pupils of the same grade of 
advancement. 
Transportation to central schools.—The collection of pupils into larger units than 
the district school furnishes may be accomplished under favorable circumstances 
by transporting at State or local expense all the pupils of the small rural districts 
ED 97. 56  
-P-A-G-E-962
  882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
to a central graded school and abolishing the small ungraded school. This is the 
radical and effective measure which is to do great good in many sections of each 
State. As shown already by the subcommittee on the maintenance of schools, 
Massachusetts, in which the plan began under the town superintendent of Concord, 
Mr. John B. Tileston (about the year 1878 in Concord, or even earlier in the town 
of Quincy, see Appendix F), paid in 1894-95 the sum of $76,608 for the transporta- 
tion of children from small rural schools to central graded schools—218 towns out 
of a total of 853 towns and cities using this plan to a greater or less extent, and 
securing the twofold result of economy in money and the substitution of graded 
for ungraded schools, The spread of this plan to Maine, Vermont, New Hamp- 
shire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Ohio, and some other States (see 
Report of Bureau of Education for 1894-95, pp. 1469-1482) demonstrates its prac- 
ticability. Experiments with this plan have already suggested improvements, as 
in the Kingsville experiment in Ohio, where the transportation reached in all cases 
the homes of the pupils, and yet reduced the cost of tuition from $22.75 to $12.25 
a year for each of the 50 pupils brought to the central school from the outlying 
districts. 
Improvement of roads.--Wherever this plan of abolishing the small ungraded 
school is practicable it is by far the best remedy to be applied. 
But there will remain large numbers of small ungraded rural schools in which 
the plan of transportation is not feasible by reason of great distances and poor 
roads. The Agricultural Department is seconding the efforts of many States to 
improve roads in rural districts. In many places road improvementis a necessary 
condition previous to the betterment of rural schools. 
Special appropriations for small rural schools.—The device of securing skilled 
and professionally trained teachers by providing, as in California, a sufficient sal- 
ary for each district, no matter how few its pupils (see Appendix C), has already 
been described by another subcommittee (that on maintenance). It is undoubt- 
edly a wise measure, provided it does not hinder the consolidation of districts 
through the adoption of the Massachusetts plan. If it works to preserve the small 
ungraded school in places where consolidation is feasible, it wjll in the end be an 
injury to the cause of rural schools. Your subcommittee therefore ventures to 
call attention to the importance of adopting such laws as are operative in Califor- 
nia, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York for the better remuneration of 
rural-school teachers, but with a proviso that makes it a pecuniary advantage to 
a town to abolish its outlying ungraded schools and furnish transportation toa 
central school. 
Concentration of the higher grades of pupils:—Where transportation of the 
whole school is not feasible, it sometimes happens that the teaching may be very 
much improved by the transfer of two or three of the pupils of the higher grades 
who consume very much of the teacher’s time. By transportation of these two or 
three pupils to the central school the teacher thus relieved may find time for much 
better instruction of the pupils in the lower grades who remain under his charge. 
School exercises at the town or county centers.—For the small ungraded schools 
that can not be abolished, perhaps one-third of all the schools in the United States 
at the present time, your subcommittee suggests the provision of occasional meet- 
ings at town centers or county centers, perhaps twice a year or oftener, under the 
direction of township, union township, or county superintendents, as the case 
may be. The meeting should have as its primary purpose the bringing together of 
advanced pupils—say sixth to ninth years’ work for examination and comparison, 
the examinations to be chiefly written. Certificates should be given to those who 
complete the elementary course of eight years as a whole or in any one of its 
branches, permitting a pupil who passes in one branch this year, say in grammer 
or history, to pass in another branch at a subsequent examination whenever he
-P-A-G-E-963
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 883 
presents himself. These examinations have been in operation in several counties 
of New Jersey for nearly twenty years. 
This plan has an interesting and profitable illustration of many of its features 
in the operation of the Boxwell law in Ohio. (State School Commissioner Corson, 
Report 1895-96.) It was also carried out years ago in many particulars by Super- 
intendent Wade in West Virginia. 
The proper use of competitive examinations.—It is understood by your subcom- 
mittee that the prejudice against competitive examinations is well grounded, It 
often happens that schools are subjected to mere mechanical drill in order to secure 
a higher per cent in this sort of examination. High per cents can not be obtained 
by entire classes upon work which requires not only a knowledge of details, but a 
knowledge of the causal relations underlying them. Your subcommittee desires 
to say that it does not recommend indiscriminate competitive examinations, but 
that it recommends written work and examinations which test the thinking ability 
of the pupil and lead him to considerate inquiries and accurate statements. High 
per cents on anything except mechanical work, such as spelling, the multiplication 
table, the tables of weights and measures, and paradigms, are not desirable. 
The plan of township and county union exercises of rural schools above de- 
scribed obviously includes the good feature of sccial interconnection, each pupil 
of the remote districts working consciously in combination with many others 
toward a common end, and all the pupils stimulated, both in school and out of it, 
by this social motive. 
Promotion of home reading.—The excellence of the Chautauquan plan for the 
promotion of home study lies in the same feature. Each reader is stimulated and 
encouraged by the consciousness that he is working on a task common to the 
endeayors of a vast multitude. The task is dignified and ennobled by such social 
participation. The youth in the rural district is by this plan to be made a home 
student, and his education is thus to be extended beyond the school. He may 
have obtained his first recognition in the township examination while he was a 
member of arural school. He is an object of semiannual inquiry on the part of 
the township or county superintendent for years afterwards. Each new teacher 
that comes to the rural school is charged by the superintendent with the duty of 
looking up the young men and young women who made a record in the central 
examinations, and inquiry is made after their continued reading and study. This 
in itself will be a powerful influence to cause young people to continue self- 
culture by studying a prescribed series of books in years subsequeut to the school 
period. It will add dignity and self-respect to the rural-school teacher who is 
charged with the work of making friendly inquiry into this school extension and 
of offering help in case of application from any of the parties interested. 
Reviewing studies.—The rural school with its five-minute or ten-minute recita- 
tions can not do much in the way of reviewing previous lessons. The good 
teacher in a graded school carries on from day to day a review of previous lessons. 
He gathers up and connects with the lesson of the day all the essential threads 
that bind it to what has gone before. It is this work of reviewing that will be 
assisted by the occasional examinations at the township center. 
Moreover, the old evil of the rural school, that of having all pupils begin at the 
beginning of the book at the commencement of each annual term, will be removed, 
for the superintendent will have a record of the standing of the advanced pupils 
and will require a report from the new teacher as to their programme of study. 
This planalso points to the utility of more written work in theruralschool. Aset 
of questions prepared beforehand and given to a pupil at the close of the week, as 
above recommended, will test not only his knowledge of the superficial details of 
his week’s work, but also of his understanding of their deeper connections and 
principles, as no oral recitation could be made to do,
-P-A-G-E-964
  884 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
School extension.—In this connection another branch of what is called ‘‘ school 
extension” or ‘‘ university extension” is practicable. Home reading can be man- 
aged from the same center, namely, the rural school. Everything that adds 
social importance to the rural teacher may be of service. It is evident that those 
pupils who have graduated from the public school and have entered upon the 
business of life may profitably carry on useful courses of reading in the various 
departments of literature and art, science, and history. The township or union 
township superintendent, in conjunction with the county superintendent or State 
superintendent, should set into operation as far as possible courses of home read- 
ing, employing the aid of the rural-school teachers to carry this into effect. A 
record containing the names of the persons who have undertaken home reading, 
the names of the books completed, and the dates of such completion will form an 
interesting record. This home reading, moreover, should have its social gather- 
ings in which there are discussions of the contents of particular books that are 
read. For this purpose the township superintendent or the county superintend- 
ent may select specially well-fitted persons who shall present analyses of the books 
and discussions of their contents. It is desirable that the course of home reading 
shall not be one-sided, but shall move in each of the three directions: literature, 
including poetry and prose; science, looking toward the organic and inorganic 
kingdoms of nature, the plant, the animal, and the details of matter and force; 
and toward archeology, ethnology, and sociology, and politics, history, biogra- 
phy, and art. One must not be altogether dissatisfied if it is found that the novel 
is the chief book in demand, especially in the first five years of the home-reading 
circle. In our day the novel discusses every question of history, politics, sociol- 
ogy, and natural science. The old-fashioned novel which describes manners has 
its great use, too, in the fact that it gives to the people of whom we are speaking, 
the people of the rural districts, a ready knowledge of manners and customs of 
polite society. In this respect it is sometimes more useful than books of science 
and history. 
Laneasterian or monitorial plan.—The topic of written work suggests a further 
topic of great importance in the rural schools, namely, that of the occasional 
employment of older pupils in the work of supervising the exercises of less 
advanced pupils—a committee of two or three pupils to examine and mark the 
papers written by those studying geography; a monitor assigned for some hour 
in the day to inquire into the work of a backward or dull pupil who has reached a 
difficult place in arithmetic; a similar assignment of a pupil to help another ina 
grammar lesson or a history lesson; these are cases where the monitorial or Lan- 
casterian system may have greater or less utility. It cultivates directive power 
and self-respect in a pupil to be called to the aid of the teacher. But the dangers 
of it are well known. No weak disciplinarian should try the monitorial system. 
On the other hand, every strong disciplinarian in the ungraded school can use 
some features of it to advantage. 
The bane of the Lancasterian system was its use to furnish cheap assistant 
teachers in graded schools. It resulted in bringing into the schools a class of 
so-called ‘‘ pupil teachers,” educational novices in the place of experienced and 
professionally trained teachers who ought to be everywhere employed in graded 
schools. Limited entirely to ungraded schools and to teachers with disciplinary 
power, the older pupils may profitably be employed to help in the work of the 
school. But they should not take up any work continuously. It should all be 
occasional, inasmuch as every thread of the school work must come under the eye 
of the schoolmaster frequently—daily, or nearly as often. If he has asked an 
older pupil to explain a point in arithmetic to a dull pupil, the latter will show the 
degree of efficiency of that help in the first recitation after it. 
Another rule for the guidance of the teacher is: Never to employ a monitor 
 
-P-A-G-E-965
  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 885 
unless such assignment of work is useful both to the pupils taught and to the 
pupil teacher. 
A teacher may gain time needed for assistance of the advanced pupils in some 
important study by requiring in advance the assistance of these pupils in some of 
the following forms: 
(1) Marking examination papers. 
(2) Helping pupils over some difficulty in arithmetic, grammar, or other branch 
having strict logical sequence in its topics. 
(3) In explaining the thought of a reading lesson to a backward pupil. 
The effort of one pupil to explain to another a difficult passage of literature is 
one of the most profitable of all school exercises. There will undoubtedly be 
crudities in the explanation, but this will all come out under the teacher’s subse- 
quent tests, and the exercises will increase in profit through the final explanation 
given by the teacher. 
(4 In assisting to test mere memory work on the part of a pupil, as in the case 
of the spelling of difficult words, the learning of paradigms in grammar, the 
learning of the required tables of weights and measures, the multiplication table, 
etc., or in any other necessary data that have to be fixed in the memory. In 
general, what is nearest to mechanical work may be supervised at times by moni- 
tors, and monitors may be useful in assisting in the preparation of thought lessons 
that are to come later before the schoolmaster, as, in the example given, the getting 
out of the thought of a reading lesson, or even of a history lesson. 
In conclusion your subcommittee would lay chief stress on the function of school 
extension, above sketched in outline, as the most profitable line of work for the 
improvement of the rural school—both pupils and teachers. 
Wim T. Harris, Chairman. 
Appison B. PoLanp.

Mr. Poland, while coneurring in most particulars, desires to add the following 
statement: z 
While I concur most heartily in nearly all of the recommendations made by the 
subcommittee on course of study, etc., I feel compelled to state that, in my opin- 
ion, the report somewhat exaggerates the difficulties and dangers of attempting 
to classify pupils in rural schools. It fails to discriminate between rural schools 
of ten-pupils each and schoo!s of a larger number, say thirty to sixty pupils each, 
The general argument is based upon conditions that exist in a ‘‘school with ten 
pupils of ages from 5 to 15 years;” and the conclusion drawn is that ‘‘for these 
reasons Classification as above described ought not to be expected in the (any) 
rural schools.” 
The conclusion, it seems to me, is altogether too general. My own observation 
of rural schools in the States of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey has 
led me to believe that their efficiency as a rule is in direct ratio to their wise and 
careful gradation; that, in fact, the best graded schools are the most efficient. I 
am speaking, of course, of rural schools containing twenty-five pupils and upward 
where partial grading at least is generally believed to be practicable. Grant all 
the cases of individual hardship that the report truly affirms of misgraded pupils, 
yet the total loss of efficiency is immeasurably less than where no grading is 
attempted. Economy of teacher’s time, longer recitation period, class emulation, 
etc., more than offset the disadvantage, often only theoretic, of a pupil’s working 
in advance of his point of ‘‘ maximum efficiency.” 
I am not, therefore, in full harmony with the report, in so far as it may have 
the effect to discourage teachers from attempting to classify pupils whenever and 
wherever practicable. 
A. B, PoLanp.
-P-A-G-E-966
  886 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Mr. Wolfe, while agreeing in many points with Mr. Harris, desires to make 
the following statement: i 
Perhaps my opinion may be characterized as explanatory or supplementary 
rather than dissenting. Believing with Dr. Harris that the chief aim of the 
report of the committee of twelve is to provoke thought, I make this contribution 
to that end. Complete unanimity no more exists among the members of this 
committee than among the great army of teachers for whom the report is pre- 
pared; nor is such unanimity desirable. The subject will be treated under the 
following heads: 
1. The present condition and trend of rural-school grading and classification in 
the Statesof the Union. 2. Dr. Harris’s plea forindividual instruction rather than 
the instruction (in the same class) of pupils who are more than one year apart in 
their advancement. 3. The underlying pedagogic principles that seem to justify 
Dr. Harris in opposing the doctrine of his report to a body of opinion on classifi- 
cation and grading which is gathering volume and momentum with each decade. 
4, Objections to the doctrine of the report. 
1. Recent decades have witnessed a strong movement in many of the States of 
the Union to model the rural-school course of study, grading, and classification 
after the ideal of the city graded school. Several States prepare, publish, and 
distribute State courses of study for rural schools, and send out, at stated times, 
uniform examination questions prepared with reference to the course of study and 
the system of grading and classification set forth therein. In other States the 
county school authorities issue the rural-school course of study. In still other 
States the school journals and associations hold up the grading and classification 
of rural schools as an ideal to be obtained in the near future. 
2. The burden of Dr. Harris’s report is: ‘‘ Be ye not unequally yoked together.” 
Just here a word of explanation of the expression ‘‘the ideal of the city graded 
school.” This ideal is a course of study divided into at least eight yearly divi- 
sions or grades of work, the pupils of the school being divided into eight corre- 
sponding divisions or grades. A school is graded when the pupils of a certain 
year or grade are pursuing the work of a corresponding year or grade in all the 
branches. It is, therefore, evident that the word “grade” has two meanings—a 
grade of work and a grade of pupils. All pupils who are graded are classified, 
unless there be but one pupil to the grade. But all pupils who are classified are 
not necessarily graded. A pupil without classmates is graded when he pursues 
all the work of the corresponding grade, and yet he can not be said to be classified. 
Pupils may be grouped in classes, and thus be classified, and yet not be graded, 
because they may be pursuing work of different grades. Dr. Harris is notopposed 
to a course of study for rural schools, nor to dividing that course of study into 
eight divisions or grades of work, nor yet to grouping pupils into classes or grades, 
provided classmates are not more than a year apart in their advancement. But 
most rural-school courses of study necessitate the grouping of the pupils of the 
fifth and sixth years of advancement into one grade; also, the grouping of the 
pupils of the seventh and eighth years into another grade. It thus happens that 
not only are pupils two years apart in their advancement yoked together in the 
same class and grade, but that, on alternate years, they are obliged to study the 
sixth year’s work before the fifth, and the eighth before the seventh. It will thus 
readily be seen that the main thought of Dr. Harris’s report is a standing protest 
against the grading and classification of pupils in the rural school as now practiced 
in many of the States. 
8. We are now to inquire what pedagogic principles can be invoked to justify 
Dr. Harris in throwing the whole weight of his influence against the evolution of 
the ungraded country school into the graded school. And first, we must bear in 
mind that the subject of the report of Dr. Harris is ‘Instruction and discipline 
in the rural schools.” First, efficient instruction must be adapted to the capacity
-P-A-G-E-967
  
REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 887 
of the learner; otherwise it can not bo grasped and assimilated. Second, other 
things being equal, instruction is more efficient when given to pupils associated in 
classes than when given to individual pupils. Not only does a pupil gain much 
information from his classmates during a recitation, but the recitation gives him 
an insight into the individual capacities and peculiarities of those among whom 
he is to succeed or fail in professional or business life. Third, efficient instruction 
requires a reasonable length of time for a class exercise. In a city graded school, 
with at least one teacher for each grade of work, the three principles—adaptation 
of instruction to the capacity of the learner, grouping of pupils into classes, and 
areasonable time for recitation—can be conserved. But in a rural school with 
one teacher, to maintain one of these principles is to sacrifice another. The prin- 
ciple of the adaptation of instruction to capacity can be adhered to by dividing 
the pupils into eight grades of advancement; but such division gives a minimum 
time for recitation and a minimum association of pupils. If, however, pupils of 
the third and fourth, fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth years of advancement be 
grouped into three corresponding grades, we secure a longer time for recitation 
and a larger measure of association, but we violate the principle of adaptation of 
instruction to capacity, thus associating, in the same grade and class, pupils two 
years apart in their advancement. It thus appears that the problem of the most 
efficient instruction in a rural school with one teacher is one of maxima and minima. 
The principle of adaptation of instruction to capacity forever antagonizes the other 
two. A maximum adherence to it means a minimum adherence to the other two, 
and vice versa. Perfect adaptation of instruction to capacity would necessitate a 
grade for each pupil. Dr. Harris’s report shows that he feels that, when pupils 
one year apart in advancement have been grouped in the same grade, this great 
principle of adaptation of instruction to capacity has been strained to its utmost 
limit, and that any sacrifice thereafter must come from other antagonistic and 
minor principles. His report throughout shows that he considers adaptation of 
instruction to capacity the paramount and controlling principle; and the fact that 
he has made this the burden of his report shows with what trained acumen he has 
brushed aside the trivial and subsidiary, and has laid grasp upon the vital and 
fundamental, 
¥ A still more universal principle underlies this valuable report. It is this: That 
the success of an institution of any kind—political, religious, economic, educa- 
tional—depends upon its adaptation to its environment. A republic is, no doubt, 
abstractly the best. form of government; but equally true is it that, under certain 
environment, an aristocracy or a monarchy is better than a republic. I take it, 
then, that Dr. Harris has been a spectator of this evolution of the rural school, 
with its peculiar environment, into the city graded school, with a very different 
environment, till he has said to himself, ‘‘This is a forced and artificial evolu- 
tion.” Having arrived at the conviction that the rural school with one teacher 
can not without injury be metamorphosed into a graded school, Dr. Harris addresses 
himself to the problem of changing the present rural school conditions, (1) through 
transportation of pupils and (2) through pupil-teachers. Now, this goes to the 
very heart of the question, for, through the transportation of pupils to central 
schools, the rural school conditions are transformed into city school conditions, 
and instruction can then proceed in harmony with the three principles above dis- 
cussed. Or, if pupil-teachers are employed, or if the pupils of the higher grades— 
fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, or seventh and eighth only—be transported, the 
rural school condition will be i a measure removed and instruction can proceed 
more in harmony with these principles. It is true that transportation of pupils 
now seems practicable only in a small portion of the territory of the United States, 
and that pupil-teaching meets with but little favor among rural-school teachers 
and pupils; but a careful study of the report of Dr. Harris will no doubt lead to a 
larger use of pupil-teachers and a much wider extension of pupil transportation,
-P-A-G-E-968
  888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
especially in the upper grammar grades. During the last few decades there has 
been in operation in many of the Western States a strong evolutionary force which 
has eliminated most of the high-school branches from the majority of the country 
schools. In such cases the pupils who have completed the eight years’ work of the 
country school are expected to find high-school instruction elsewhere at their own 
expense of tuition and transportation. May not this same evolutionary force in 
its own due time similarly eliminate from the rural schools the work of grades 7 
and 8? Whether such rejected pupils will be transported or not will depend upon 
the sentiment of the community. In favor of the ultimate transportation of not 
only grades 7 and 8, but of higher grades, is that great socialistic force that has 
given birth to our free-school system, our postal system, and our asylums for 
physical, moral, and mental delinquents. Having addressed himself to the modi- 
fication of rural school environment through pupil transportation and pupil-teach- 
ers, the doctor finds himself face to face with a great body of rural school conditions 
which are unmodified and at present unmodifiable. Itis here that he makes his 
plea for individual instruction rather than the instruction in the same class of 
pupils who are more than a year apart in their advancement. 
4, The branches of the eight years’ course of the rural school are: Writing, 
drawing, music; physiology, grammar, civil government; spelling, language, 
geography, history; reading; arithmetic. We shall be able to get a better under- 
standing of the subject if we suppose a city school of eight grades, four rooms, and 
four teachers to be suddenly reduced to one-fourth its former number of pupils, 
rooms, and teachers. There will then remain one teacher, one room, eight grades 
of pupils, and eight grades of work, and, say, forty pupils; that is substantially 
rural school conditions. This one teacher now finds that, while he has no more 
pupils to instruct than he had before, these pupils are ‘scattered among the eight 
grades. If he adheres strictly to the former graded structure of the school, keep- 
ing each grade of pupils distinct in all the branches (allowing six recitations a day 
to each grade), he will have eight times six, or forty-eight, classes. This gives 
him an average of about five minutes for a recitation period. The inadequacy of 
this time for the development of a subject needs no comment. He must group 
these scattered pupils into classes, largely ignoring grades, and many of these 
classes will contain pupils from different grades. By almost unanimous consent 
it is agreed that the pupils of the eight grades can be grouped, for general exer- 
cises, in writing, drawing, and music, requiring but one recitation period for each 
branch. One recitation period will answer for each branch in grammar, physi- 
ology, and civil government; two recitation periods each in spelling, language, 
geography, and history; four in reading; five in elementary numbers and arith- 
metic. This gives twenty-three recitations, ranging from ten minutes in the 
lowest grades to twenty in the highest. It will be observed that I state above that 
many of these classes will contain pupils from different grades. Here appears the 
significance of my definitions of class and grade in the beginning of this discus- 
sion—definitions on which the teachers of this country are far from being a unit. 
The fundamental principle underlying grading is symmetrical development; the 
fundamental principle underlying classifying is harmonious development. Sym- 
metrical development aims to advance the pupil with equal pace in all the 
branches; harmonious development aims to advance him in harmony with his 
individual capabilities. Many of the pupils of our best graded schools are classi- 
fied in violation of the principle of harmonious development. 
This statement takes no note of mistakes in grading by which pupils are 
assigned to the wrong grades. The grading of schools in accordance with the 
principle of symmetrical development necessitates a violation of the principle of 
harmonious development. I have reference to those pupils who are assigned to 
the right grade in a majority of the branches they pursue, but who, in one or 
more branches, belong to grades above or below the one to which they are assigned,

  REPORT ON RURAL SCHOOLS. 889 
It, therefore, follows that the reorganization consequent upon transforming the 
four-teacher school into the one-teacher school would bring some pupils into 
classes better suited to their abilities than the classes to which the graded system 
had assigned them, thus bringing about a classification more in harmony with the 
principle of adaptation of instruction to the capacity of the learner. Classification 
and its correlative principle of harmonious development are the corner stone of 
the rural school; grading and its correlative principle of symmetrical development 
are equally fundamental to the city school. In a graded school the pupil is 
assigned to classes belonging to one grade only; in the country school he is assigned 
to classes adapted to his capacity, regardless of the number of grades represented 
by these classes. I institute no comparison here as to the relative merits of the 
principles—harmonious development and symmetrical development—but simply 
state the fact of their relations respectively to the city and rural schools. 
If practical adaptation of instruction to the capacity of the pupil were really 
attainable in the graded school, I should hesitate to recommend a classification 
that would group in one class pupils more than a year apart in their advance- 
ment. But such adaptation is largely ideal and theoretical. However well the 
school be graded, the strongest pupils and the weakest are separated by a long 
distance in the character or grade of their work. Whether in the primary, the 
grammar, the high school, the college, or the university, a certain per cent of the 
students do most of the highest order of work. These strongest pupils discover 
and develop the deepest relations. The weaker pupils soon learn to repeat the 
stereotyped expressions of these relations, and to store them away in their memories 
to be fished forth at stated intervals by the written test. The Apostle Paul, that 
he might not offend his brother, would eat no more flesh while the world stood; 
but a large per cent of the students of all grades, not from fear of offending their 
brother, but from their very mental constitutions, abstain, with equal fidelity, 
from the strongest mental diet. I can select, at random, one-half the pupils from 
grades 6 and 7 of a city school, and put them to studying, indifferently, North 
America, South America, Europe, or Asia, and the former leaders in grades 6 and 
7, respectively, will still lead. What is true of geography is true of history, civil 
government, physiology, spelling and reading, and, in a measure, of grammar and 
arithmetic. Certain pupils are mentally built for accuracy, clearness, depth, and 
power; others, for relative inaccuracy, obscurity, shallowness, and weakness. A 
rule requiring, as a condition of promotion, that all pupils of any certain grade 
should do as high an order of work as is being done by some of the pupils of that 
grade would virtually stop the wheels of promotion. Many of the pupils would 
never reach a higher grade; many others would do so only after repeated attempts 
and failures. 
The gist of Dr. Harris’s objection to grouping pupils who are more than a year 
apart in their advancement is that the more advanced pupils will ke kept marking 
time, while the less advanced will be dragged along at an unnatural rate. My 
answer is that the stronger pupils will do the higher order of thinking, just as 
they always do, while the weaker pupils will do the lower order of thinking, as they 
always do, getting some knowledge from the books, some from the teacher, and 
some from their stronger classmates. The rural school has the advantage over 
the city school in that its pupils learn much from the recitation of classes to which 
they do not belong. Ina graded school the walls of the schoolroom shut pupils 
out from what is being recited in other grades. In a rural school the pupil can 
listen to the recitation of any grade. You tell me that this is absorption, that the 
pupil gets this outside knowledge at the expense of the preparation of his own 
lessons, and that the practice of listening to other recitations militates against the 
principle that a great aim in education is to learn to master the printed page; but 
it is nevertheless the testimony of many of our greatest educators that the knowl- 
edge thus obtained by them in the country school was invaluable. The mind has
-P-A-G-E-970
  890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
strange and subtle methods of threading its way to knowledge, not always in har- 
mony with the pedagogue’s theory. What teacher in arithmetic (who has had 
the courage, temporarily at least, to lay aside his cut and dried solution formule) 
has not been surprised and delighted at the ingenious methods different pupils 
have of solving problems? What master of the topical method in history, civil 
government, or literature has not marveled at the rich relations revealed by 
pupils when left free to take their own initiative? A nation does not postpone its 
entrance upon a career of republican government till all its members are ready 
for self-government. The members of a church are not of equal intellectual or 
spiritual caliber, nor are the members of a family; yet they are associated in one 
class—the state, the church, the family. In actual life, persons of all degrees of 
advancement behold alike the same procession of the heavens, the same succession 
of seasons, the same world happenings; but all do not get the same kind and 
amount of information from the marshaling of the constellations, the budding 
and fruiting of spring and summer, and the drama of events daily unfolding. I 
grant that the examples above given are not identical with the thing to be exem- 
plified, but they present important elements of similarity. Finally, I am fully 
convinced that the rural school conditions necessitate a departure from the doc- 
trine so ably laid down by Dr. Harris, and I believe principles can be found to 
justify such departure. Whether or not I have found these principles and set 
them forth in this supplementary report is another question.

  CHAPTER XVIUI. 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR ENGINEERING COLLEGES. 
At the Buffalo meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Engi- 
neering Education, in August, 1896, the committee on entrance 
requirements of engineering colleges presented a report giving the 
results of their investigations. 
The committee was composed of the following members: F. O. 
Marvin, Mansfield Merriman, J. P. Jackson, J. J. Flather, and H. W. 
Tyler. 
In their report the committee adopted the following classification 
of colleges, which was not based upon the relative general merits or 
standing of the colleges, but had reference solely to their entrance 
requirements: 
Class A. Those colleges whose requirements for admission include 
at least algebra through quadratics, plane geometry, solid geometry 
or plane trigonometry, one year of foreign language, and moderately 
high requirements in English. (31 colleges.) 
Class B. Those colleges of the remaining list whose requirements 
include algebra through quadratics and plane geometry. (33 col- 
leges. ) 
Class C. Those colleges whose requirements in mathematics are 
lower than algebra through quadratics and plane geometry. (25 col- 
leges. ) 
Class D. 'Those colleges that offer no courses in engineering as 
such, but do work analogous to that of an engineering college, gener- 
ally under the head of mechanic arts. Many of them will undoubt- 
edly develop into genuine engineering colleges. A few of them now 
give engineering work in a fifth or post-graduate year. (18 colleges.) 
Existing requirements.—The requirements for admission to the 89 
colleges of Classes A, B, and C are given in the following table in 
detail for the purpose of showing their gread range and variety. The 
data have been taken almost entirely from the catalogues of 1895, 
supplemented by information gained by the committee through cir- 
culars of inquiry and through correspondence.

-P-A-G-E-974
  894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The replies to the inquiries of the committee tended to show that 
nearly every college is satisfied with its own plan of admission. The 
report goes on to say: 
There are 21 colleges that seem to have fair regulations governing admission by 
certificate, though there are ‘very few that publish their rules in detail or that 
have given them in detail to the committee if they exist. The University of Cal- 
ifornia has one of the best and most complete systems. The scheme includes the 
following points, viz: 
1. Application for accrediting to be on a special blank, showing the subjects on 
which the school seeks to be accredited, the names of teachers and the subjects 
taught by them, the number of pupils in each grade, length of school year and 
terms, etc., and accompanied by sets of actual examination papers and the course 
of study. 
2. Visitation of school by a faculty committee, whose favorable report is essential. 
3. Application for accrediting must be renewed annually. Inspection is annual 
also. 
4, Schools are notified of being accredited on special blanks, showing the require- 
ments for different university courses, the courses for which the school may pre- 
pare, and the subjects for which they can write certificates. 
5. Certificate signed by the principal shows the graduation of the candidate, the 
list of subjects in each of which the principal recommends, and the course the can- 
didate desires to enter. 
6. Lack of above recommendation in any subject to be counted a failure, 
‘7, More than two failures, or one failure and two conditions, or three conditions 
prevents admission. 
8. Failure in algebra and geometry or physics and chemistry prevents admission. 
9. Certificates are accepted by a committee, but can only be rejected by the 
academic council. 
10. Besides above-mentioned blanks, the university issues departmental circulars 
as occasion arises containing suggestions as to preparatory work. Also an admis- 
sion circular of 120 pages containing the following matter: A few pages of general 
information; extended description of all subjects included in any recuirements; 
requirements for the different university courses; time, place, and order of entrance 
examinations; rules governing examinations; rules for accrediting schools; sug- 
gestions regarding preparation for the university; samples of questions previously 
used for entrance examinations. 
11. The university holds conferences on secondary education with high schools 
and normal schools. : 
Professor Christy speaks well of the working of.this system and says that it is 
the result of a good many years of persistent effort on the part of the university. 
The University of Michigan has a similar plan, accrediting schools for three 
years, using four circulars. No.1, the circular of instructions to the school apply- 
ing. No. 2, the application showing enrollment, length of course and year, size of 
library, amount of apparatus and museum collections, character of laboratories, 
etc., also asking for further information concerning teachers, their length of serv- 
ice, where educated, subjects taught; concerning studies, the text used, the ground 
covered, time given in weeks and hours per week, and in what grade the subject 
is taught. No.3, report of inspecting committee, including statistics of the school 
and its facilities, a statement of studies pursued, text-books used, time given, 
grade of work, an estimate of the efficiency of each teacher, and a recommenda- 
tion that graduates be admitted to certain indicated university courses. The 
inspection may be made by others than members of the faculty, the university 
delegating its authority to some selected person or persons. No. 4, the certificate 
showing graduation and detailed list of subjects. 
The School of Practical Science, at Toronto, admits the largest part of its stu-

dents on a government certificate to the effect that the candidate has passed the 
“high school leaving examination.” In the Province of Ontario the government 
conducts these public school examinations. 
In New York and adjacent States the certificates of the New York regents are 
taken by some colleges for the ground covered. 
Not all of the 21 colleges mentioned above have as complete a method as Cali- 
fornia or Michigan, but they all require considerably more on the part of a 
school seeking to be accredited than the mere condition of ‘‘ being satisfactorv to 
the faculty.” 
In expressing an opinion as to the present working of the certificate plan, or 
its extension, many of the committee’s correspondents are epigrammatic or 
answer its questions by a short yes or no. But one can gather from the general 
character of the replies that the objections raised are in many cases due to dis- 
satisfaction, not so much with the present system as with its working, and that 
those favoring the system do so because of its applicability to existing conditions 
and its inherent advantages. 
Uniformity of requirements.—The tabulation below gives a summary of the 
replies under this head: 
  
    
  Total.

Not desirable... 6 1 15 
Practicable to so1 8 2 28 
Not practicable. 8 9 13 2 82 
    
The replies as a whole are quite decidedly favorable to the abstract idea of uni- 
formity, though the belief in its practicability is not so general. Here again the 
answers, many of them, were confined to monosyllables or were given in more or 
less uncertain terms. This is a very natural result, because no definite plan of 
action was presented for consideration and because of a lack of practical experi- 
ence with any scheme involving it. 
General statement of principles.—Before the committee formulated 
its conclusions, attention was directed to certain general principles, 
some of which were assumed by the committee, while others form the 
basis of replies received. These principles and the conclusions of 
the committee are stated as follows: 
1. Inits circulars of inquiry the committee expressed its opinion that ‘“ prepara- 
tion for scientific or other colleges is an essentially secondary function of the 
great body of high schools of the country, and that entrance requirements should 
be, so far as necessary, adapted to the capacity of any high school of thorough 
methods and high standards.” 
2. The primary object of entrance examinations or other requirements is to 
determine whether each candidate for admission has attained a certain standard, 
of development on the one hand, of information on the other, fitting him to under- 
take the work of the particular college in question. 
3. The secondary effect of entrance requirements in particular subjects is a ten- 
dency on the part of teacher and candidate to concentration of effort on those sub- 
jects required, at the expense—perhaps to the neglect—of others. In particular 
cases this may even seriously deform the school curriculum. This consideration 
must not be overlooked in formulating a normal list of requirements. 
4, The tendency of all examinations is to stimulate preparatory study, the degree 
of such stimulation varying widely according to circumstances, and requiring, as 
in case of any other stimulus, very careful control. For such control the col- 
leges must depend in the main on the schools; unless it is exercised, the results of 
the examination are of relatively slight value. Certain teachers and certain schools  
-P-A-G-E-976
    896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
are notoriously able to prepare candidates who can pass entrance examinations, 
but do little afterwards. 
5, The entrance examination at its best is a healthful stimulus especially to an 
indolent candidate; it presents to the schools an external, independent, concrete 
standard by which their work may be measured to the satisfaction of the ambi- 
tious and successful, to the confusion of the unworthy; it enforces upon school 
committees the need of strengthening weak points. 
6. On the other hand, besides the danger noted under 4, the examination has 
certain serious defects as a test. Examiner and teacher are separated by a wall 
with more or less numerous loopholes, catalogue specifications, former examina- 
tions, etc. Too often the examiner’s object is merely to select the best of these 
loopholes, that is to ‘‘ coach ”—not to educate—his candidate. 
It is difficult to proportion the parts of an examination in accordance with the 
relative importance of the corresponding topics. It is difficult even to make the 
questions so clear that some applicants shall not totally misunderstand them. 
It is difficult to judge applicants fairly—in some cases even to mark their 
examinations justly—without personal acquaintance, Some always do themselves 
more than justice, others less. 
Last and most important, while an entrance examination may be an adequate 
and accurate test of an applicant’s knowledge of particular subjects, it isan indi- 
rect criterion of general mental capacity on the one hand, and of specific aptitude 
for the kind of work in view on the other. 
7. In consideration of these defects of the entrance examination system, many 
colleges substitute admission by certificate; many others attempt to strengthen 
their weak points by a combination of the two systems. 
Some of the advantages of a good certificate system are these: 
(a) It requires supervision and examination of the work of the school by the 
college or by some other central body, thus showing strength or weakness in the 
work directly. 
(b) It gives the certificated school authoritative recognition which, if deserved, 
it ought to have. 
(c) It keeps school and college in touch with each other. 
(d) It substitutes for the information test of examinations the judgment of a 
teacher to whom theapplicantis personally known. A good teacher must generally 
be a better judge of mental capacity and aptitude than the best examiner. 
Familiar difficulties of the certificate system are: 
(a) The difficulty of establishing and maintaining—by law, or by college 
cooperation—the necessary ‘‘ supervision and examination” of school work. 
(b) The extreme diversity of work in different parts of the country and State. 
The certificate system should tend to remedy this. 
(c) The reluctance of college officers to deny or suspend the acceptance of cer- 
tificates from poor schools. 
(d) The reluctance of school officers to deny certification to unfit applicants. 
8. The tendency of present diversity is to localize education unduly. Itis gen- 
erally difficult for a candidate to prepare for a college in some other, perhaps dis- 
tant State, as easily as for one in his own. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. 
1. Uniformity of requirements.—The committee regards absolute uniformity of 
requirements as entirely inconsistent with the diversity of educational conditions 
in different States, and as not in itself desirable. Each community, large or 
small, must work upward as it best can toward its own ideal. Variation is the 
basis of evolution. 
Needless arbitrary deviations from uniformity in mere details are vexatious 
and harmful to all concerned and should be removed as soon as possible by 
cooperation between colleges and schools.
-P-A-G-E-977
  ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR ENGINEERING COLLEGES, 897 
To secure such degree of uniformity as is practicable, the committee recom- 
mends the approval by this society of a definite list of entrance requirements 
somewhat as follows: + 
Mathematics.—Arithmetic (complete); algebra, elementary; algebra, through 
quadratics; algebra, advanced; geometry, plane; geometry, solid; trigonometry, 
plane. 
Science.—Physical geography, botany, chemistry, physics. 
Language.—English, French, German, Latin. 
General.—Free-hand drawing, United States history, some second subject in 
history. 
This list includes the requirements of nearly ail of the colleges. From this list 
are excluded the scattering odds and ends, writing, reading, partial arithmetic, 
mensuration, elementary mechanics, higher mathematics, civil government, local 
government, bookkeeping, elocution, mental science, logic, economics, theory of 
teaching, Miln’s Realm of Nature, zoology, astronomy, geology, mineralogy, mete- 
orology, natural history, biology, introduction to science, etymology, Latinelements 
of English, Spanish, and Greek. This diversity has crept in to some extent, no 
doubt, through the attempt on the part of colleges to meet the varying courses of 
their contributory schools through a system of options in requirements, and pos- 
sibly to make the scientific courses level up to the classical ones without the neces- 
sity of imposing the dead languages on the student. But the effect has been to 
scatter and to produce confusion on the one hand, and to limit each college to its 
own field of cultivated schools on the other. 
What some of these subjects are doing as requirements for engineering courses, 
unless as temporary makeshifts, is not easily comprehended. There is enough 
within the above list, that so many colleges agree upon, to fully occupy the time 
of any boy in his four years in the high school, and there is variety enough to 
give breadth of training. There is work in the five chief lines of mathematics, 
language and literature, history, science, and art. Any school course, on the one 
hand, and any college set of requirements, on the other, ought to include all of 
these lines. 
Again, while the colleges should confine themselves to the above subjects, there 
is nothing in the list that does not properly fit into the school curriculum, Lab- 
oratory work of the right kind in physics, chemistry, and botany may be found in 
comparatively few schools, but it ought to be given in all high schools with four- 
year courses for their own sakes, irrespective of the demands of scientific colleges. 
Somewhat apart from the other subjects named, stands manual training, includ- 
ing shop work and mechanical drawing. 
It is obviously impossible, even if desirable, to make either of these a require- 
ment for admission to engineering colleges generally. On the other hand, the 
engineering colleges should be the first to recognize the true value of hand and eye 
work as a form of education. The committee believes that, so far as practicable, 
such recognition should be more generally shown by the acceptance of certified 
work in manual training as an optional requirement by institutions accepting 
any optional subjects. As previously stated there are only two engineering col- 
leges that at present require manual training. 
2. What should be required.—It is difficult to generalize, to the extent of laying 
down absolute requirements to which all colleges should conform. Yet, broadly 
speaking, there exist to-day two grades of engineering colleges whose work lies 
about one year apart. For the first of these the minimum requirements should 
include the following subjects: Algebra (advanced), plane and solid geometry, 
physics with laboratory work, chemistry with laboratory work, New England 
requirements in English, two years of foreign language, American history and 
some additional history, free-hand drawing. 
For the second grade the minimum requirements should include: Algebra

  898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
through quadratics, plane geometry, physics,! English along the line of New Eng- 
land requirements but less in amount, one year of foreign language, American 
history, free-hand drawing. 
Below these are colleges, like some of the colleges of architecture and mechanic 
arts, that are forced by the necessities of environment or the terms of their foun- 
dation to maintain low standards of admission and do in course what other col- 
leges throw into requirements. These should insist on requiring as a minimum: 
Arithmetic (complete), elementary algebra, plane geometry, English along the 
line of New England requirements, but less in amount, American history. 
Any lower requirements than these bring students into college before they have 
completed their courses in the lower schools. This works a double injustice, 
through lessening the force and prestige of the preparatory school and making it 
necessary for the college to do some of its work. 
The differentiation here spoken of is not confined to the requirements, but is 
naturally apparent in the courses. These gradations in colleges are inevitable. 
They constitute one of the expressions of the varying conditions of life in the dif- 
ferent communities and sections of thisbroad land. Thesooner that this isfrankly 
and freely admitted and acted upon, the better for American education. The older 
and higher grade colleges should recognize the value and dignity of the work of those 
that are newer or of lower grade, and on the basis of quality rather than grade. 
On the other hand, the newer or lower grade colleges ought to recognize that 
the graduates of the colleges of higher grade are more evenly educated, more 
broadly cultured and better equipped for professional life than their own, and 
cease trying to bring about an apparent equality of grade. President S. P. 
McCrea, of the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, writes: 
“New Western colleges like this will be more concerned in securing advanced 
standing for their engineering students in the older and high-grade institutions, 
than in attempting to put their work on the same plane without respect to condi- 
tions. Can your committee do anything in this direction? If not, can a commit- 
tee be appointed to deal with this matter?” The same spirit is manifested by 
correspondents from some other points. 
8. Admission by certificate.—In the opinion of the committee, the advantages 
of the certificate system as already outlined, are fundamental, and its defects are 
toa great extent temporary and remediable with the general ‘leveling up” of 
secondary school work, Here absolute uniformity is not to be thought of. The 
more general observance of the following principles is of the highest importance: 
(a) As the primary essential, personal visitation and inspection, on the part of 
the college, of the school asking a commission. 
(b) This commission to be limited as to time and reissued only after reinspec- 
tion, or on full knowledge of the condition of the school. 
(c) The reservation of the right of the college to withdraw the commission for 
cause shown. 
(d) Certificates to show in detail the extent of the ground covered and actual 
time spent in each subject and to contain the personal recommendation of the 
superintendent or principal. 
(e) Students received on certificate to be required to make up any deficiency in 
preparation that may appear in any certificated subject. 
(f) The college to cultivate friendly relations with its accredited schools and to 
make clear, through publications and conferences, just what its requirements are. 
In the application of these principles each college would necessarily work out 
its own details, and under present conditions be obliged to do its own visiting and 
inspecting. But there is no reason why the colleges should not cooperate in this 
matter under suitable restrictions, the commissioning of a school by one, involving 
its acceptance by others. 
  
1In the opinion of the committee the physics should include laboratory work.

  CHAPTER XIX. 
EARLY HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS, MO.! 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION—WHERE IT SHOULD BEGIN. 
There has been for some time a popular clamor in favor of the introduction of 
the arts and trades into public schools. It has been supposed by self-styled ‘‘prac- 
tical” writers upon education that the school should fit the youth for the practice 
of some vocation or calling. They would have the child learn a trade as well as 
reading, writing, and arithmetic; and the most zealous of them demand that it 
shall be a trade, and not much else. But the good sense of the educational world, 
as a whole, has not been moved to depart from the even tenor of its way, and has 
defended its preference for technical, conventional, and disciplinary training of a 
general character, useful for each and every one, no matter what his vocation shall 
be. Who can tell, on seeing the child, what special vocation he will best follow 
when he grows up? Besides this, the whole time of the child, so far as it can be 
had without overtasking him, is needed from the period of 6 or 7 years to 16 years 
in order to give him a proper amount of this training in technical, conventional, 
and disciplinary studies. Moreover, it is evident that these general studies are 
the keys to the world of nature and man, and that they transcend in value any 
special forms of skill, such as arts and trades, by as great a degree as the general 
law surpasses the particular instance. It is to be claimed that arithmetic, the 
science of numbers, for example, is indispensable in a thousand arts and sciences, 
while each art has much in it that is special and of limited application in the 
other arts. 
But, on the other hand, analytical investigation has done much in the way of 
singling out from the physical movement involved in the trades those which are 
common and may be provided for by general disciplines of the body, which may 
be introduced into the school along with the science underlying the art. For 
example, the theory and practice of drawing involves arithmetic and geometry, 
and also the training of the hand and eye. Thus, drawing furnishes a kind of 
propzedeutics to all of the arts and trades, and could not fail to make more skill- 
ful the workman, whatever his calling. Drawing, then, may properly enter the 
programme of all schools, having its claim acknowledged to be a general 
discipline. © 
FROEBEL’S ‘‘GIFTS”—THEIR RATIONALE, 
But while we may acknowledge the transcendent importance of the regular 
branches for the period of time claimed by the school at present—namely, from 
the age of 6 to 16—it must be conceded that the age from 4 years to 6 years is not 
mature enough to receive profit from thé studies of the school. The conventional 
and the disciplinary studies are too much for the powers of the child of 4 years or 
Syears, But the child of 4 years or 5 years is in a period of transition out of the

  900 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
stage of education which we have named ‘‘nurture.”. He begins to learn of the 
outdoor life, of the occupations and ways of people beyond the family circle, and 
to long for a further acquaintance with them. He begins to demand society with 
others of his own age outside his family, and to repeat for himself, in miniature, 
the picture of the great world of civil society, mimicking it in his plays and 
games. Through play the child gains individuality; his internal—‘‘ subjective,” 
as it is called—nature becomes active, and he learns to know his own tendencies 
and proclivities> Through caprice and arbitrariness, the child learns to have a 
will of his own and not to exercise a mere mechanical compliance with the will 
of his elders. 
It is at this period of transition from the life in the family to that of the school 
that the kindergarten furnishes what is most desirable, and in doing so solves 
many problems hitherto found difficult of solution. The genius of Froebel has 
provided a system of discipline and instruction which is wonderfully adapted to 
this stage of the child’s growth, when he needs the gentleness of nurture and the 
rational order of the school in due admixture. The ‘gifts and occupations,” as 
he calls them, furnish an initiation into the arts and sciences; and they do this in 
a manner half playful, half serious. 
Of the twenty gifts which the kindergarten system offers, the first six form a 
group having the one object to familiarize the child with the elementary notions 
of geometry. He learns the forms of solids, the cube, sphere, and cylinder, and 
their various surfaces; also, divisions ot the cube and combinations of the cube 
and its divisions in building various objects. He learns counting and measuring 
by the eye, for the cube and its divisions are made on a scale of an inch and frac- 
tions of an inch, and the squares into which the surface of his table is divided are 
square inches, Counting, adding, subtracting, and dividing the parts of the cube 
give him the elementary operations of arithmetic, so far as small numbers are 
concerned, and give him a very practical knowledge of them; for he can use his 
knowledge, and he has developed it, step by step, with his own activity. 
It is always the desideratum in education to secure the maximum of self-activity 
in the pupil. The kindergarten gifts are the best instrumentalities ever devised 
for the purpose of educating young children through self-activity. Other devices 
may do this—other devices have done it—but Freebel’s apparatus is most success- 
ful. It is this fact that occasions the exaggerated estimate which his disciples 
place upon the originality of Froebel’s methods. Long beforehis day it was known 
and stated as the first principle of pedagogy that the pupil is educated, not by what 
others do for him, but by what he is led todo for himself. But Freebel’s system of 
gifts is so far in advance of the other systems of apparatus for primary instruction 
as to create an impression in the mind of the one who first studies it that Froebel 
is the original discoverer of the pedagogical law of self-activity in the pupil. The 
teacher who has already learned correct methods of instruction, or who has read 
some in the history of pedagogy, knows this principle of self-activity, but has 
never found, outside of the kindergarten, so wonderful a system of devices for 
the proper education of the child of 5 years old. 
The first group of gifts, including the first six of the twenty, asalready remarked, 
takes up the forms of solids and their division, and therefore deals with forms and 
number of solids. The second group of gifts includes the four from the seventh 
to the tenth, and concerns surfaces, and leads up from the manipulation of thin 
blocks or tablets to drawing with a pencil on paper ruled in squares. In drawing, 
the child has reached the ideal representation of solids by means of light and 
shade—marks made on a surface to represent outlines. The intermediate gifts— 
the eighth and ninth—relate to stick-laying and ring-laying, representing outlines 
of objects by means of straight and curved sticks or wires. This, in itself, is a 
well-devised link between the quadrangular and triangular tablets (which are 
 
-P-A-G-E-981
HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 901 
treated only as surfaces) and the art of drawing. We have a complete transition 
from the tangible solid to the ideal representation of it. 
Counting and the elementary operations in numbers continue through all the 
subsequent groups of gifts, but in the first group are the chief object. In the first 
group the solid, in its various shapes, is the object of study for the child. He 
learns to recognize and name the surfaces, corners, angles, etc., which bound it. 
In the second group the surface and its corners or angles become the sole object. 
But the child begins the second group with the surface represented by tablets, 
thin blocks, and proceeds to represent mere outlines by means of sticks or wire 
(in the eighth gift), and then to leave the solid form altogether and to make an 
ideal one by means of pencil marks on slate or paper (in the tenth gift). Theslate 
or paper, ruled in squares of an inch, like the kindergarten tables, is the best 
device for training the muscles of thefingers and hand to accuracy. The untrained 
muscles of the hand of the child can not guide the pencil so as to make entire 
forms at first; but by the device of the ruled squares he is enabled to construct 
forms by the simple process of drawing straight lines, vertical, horizontal, and 
oblique, connecting the sides and corners of the ruled squares. The training of 
the eye and hand in the use of this tenth gift is the surest and most effective 
discipline ever invented for the purpose. 
Here it becomes evident that if the school is to prepare especially for the arts 
and trades it is the kindergarten which is to accomplish the object, for the train- 
ing of the muscles, if it is to be a training for special skill in manipulation, must 
be begun in early youth. As age advances, it becomes more difficult to acquire 
new phases of manual dexterity. 
Two weeks’ practice of holding objects in his right hand will make the infant, 
in his first year, right-handed for life. Tbe muscles, yet in a pulpy consistency, 
are very easily set in any fixed direction. The child trained for one year on 
Froebel’s gifts and occupations will acquire a skillful use of his hands and a habit 
of accurate measurement of the eye which will be his possession for life. 
But the arts and trades are provided for in a still more effective manner by the 
subsequent gifts. The first group, as we have seen, trains the eye and the sense 
of touch, and gives a technical acquaintance with solids and with the elementary 
operations of arithmetic. The second group frees him from the hard limits which 
have confined him to the reproduction of forms by mere solids, and enables him 
to represent by means of light and shade. His activity at each step becomes 
more purely creative as regards the production of forms and more rational as 
regards intellectual comprehension, for he ascends from concrete, particular, 
tangible objects to abstract general truths and archetypal forms. 
The third group of gifts includes the eleventh and twelfth, and develops new 
forms of skill, less general and more practical. Having learned how to draw out- 
lines of objects by the first ten gifts, the eleventh and twelfth gifts teach the 
pupil how to embroider; i. e., how to represent outlines of objects by means of 
needle and thread. The eleventh gift takes the first step, by teaching the use of 
the perforating needle. The child learns to represent outlines of forms by per- 
forations in paper or cardboard. Then, in the twelfth gift, he learns the art of 
embroidering, and, of course, with this he learns the art of sewing and its mani- 
fold kindred arts. The art of embroidery calls into activity the muscles of the 
hand, and especially those of the fingers, the eye in accurate measurement, and 
the intellectual activities required in the geometrical and arithmetical processes 
involved in the work. 
The fourth group of gifts (including the thirteenth to the eighteenth) intro- 
duces the important art of weaving and plaiting. 
Among the primitive arts of man this was the most useful. It secures the 
maximum of lightness with the maximum of strength, by using fragile material
-P-A-G-E-982
    902 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
in such a manner as to convert the linear into the surface and combine the weak 
materials into the form of mutual firm support. 
The thirteenth gift (with which the fourth group begins) teaches how to cut 
the paper into strips; the fourteenth weaves the strips into mats or baskets, with 
figures of various devices formed by the meshes; the fifteenth gift uses thin slats 
of wood for plaiting, and the sixteenth uses the same, jointed, with a view to 
reproducing forms of surfaces; the seventeenth gift intertwines paper, and the 
eighteenth constructs elaborate shapes by folding paper. This group constructs 
surfaces by the methods of combining strips or linear material. Vessels of 
capacity (baskets, sieves, nets, etc.), clothing (of woven cloth), and shelter (tents, 
etc.) are furnished by branches of this art. 
Wood is linear in its structure, and stronger in the direction of the grain of the 
wood. Hence it became necessary to invent a mode of adding lateral strength by 
crossing the fibers, in the form of weaving or plaiting, in order to secure the maxi- 
mum of strength with the minimum of bulk and weight. Besides wood, there are 
various forms of flexible plants (the willow, etc.) and textile fibers (hemp, flax, 
cotton, etc.) which can not be utilized except in this manner, having longitudinal 
but not lateral cohesion. 
In the fourth group of gifts the industrial direction of the work of the kinder- 
garten becomes the most pronounced. There is more of practical value and less 
of theoretic value in its series of six gifts (thirteenth to eighteenth). But its 
disciplines are still general ones, like drawing, and furnish a necessary training 
for the hands and eyes of all who will labor for a livelihood; and, besides these, for 
all who will practice elegant employments for relaxation (ladies’ embroidery), or 
athletic sports and amusements (the games and amusements that test accuracy of 
hand and eye, or mathematical combination, marksmanship, hunting, fishing, ball 
playing, archery, quoits, bowling, chess playing, etc.). 
The fifth group, including the nineteenth and twentieth gifts, teaches the pro- 
duction of solid forms, as the fourth teaches the production of surfaces from the 
linear. The nineteenth, using corks (or peas soaked in water) and pieces of wire 
or sticks of various lengths and pointed ends, imitates various real objects and 
geometrical solids by producing their outlines, edges, or sections. This gift, too, 
furnishes the preparation for drawing in perspective. The twentieth and last 
gift uses some modeling material (potter’s clay, beeswax, or other plastic sub- 
stance), and teaches modeling of solid objects. This group of gifts is propedeutic 
to the greater part of the culinary arts, so far as they give shape to articles of food. 
It also prepares for the various arts of the foundry—casting or modeling—of the 
pottery, etc., and the fine arts of sculpture and the preparation of architectural 
ornament. 
In the common school, drawing, which has obtained only a recent and precari- 
ous foothold in our course of study, is the only branch which is intended to culti- 
vate skill in the hand and accuracy in the eye. The kindergarten, on the other 
hand, develops this by all of its groups of gifts. 
Not only is this training of great importance by reason of the fact that most 
children must depend largely upon manual skill for their future livelihood, but, 
from a broader point of view, we must value skill as the great potence which is 
emancipating the human race from drudgery by theaidof machinery. Inventions 
will free man from thralldom to time and space. 
By reason of the fact, already adverted to, that a short training of certain mus- 
cles of the infant will be followed by the continued growth of the same muscles 
through his after life, it is clear how it is that the two years of the child’s life (his 
fifth and sixth), or even one year, or a half year, in the kindergarten will start 
into development activities of muscle and brain which will secure deftness and 
delicacy of industrial power in all after life. The rationale of this is found 
in the fact that it is a pleasure to use muscles already inured to use; in fact, a
-P-A-G-E-983
  HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 903 
much-used muscle demands a daily exercise as much as the stomach demands food. 
But an unused muscle, or the mere rudiment of a muscle that has never been used, 
gives pain on its first exercise. Its contraction is accompanied with laceration of 
tissue, and followed by lameness, or by distress on using it again. Hence it hap- 
pens that the body shrinks from employing an unused muscle, but, on the con- 
trary, demands the frequent exercise of muscles already trained to use. Hence in 
a thousand ways, unconscious to ourselves, we manage to exercise daily whatever 
muscles we have already trained, and thus keep in practice physical aptitudes for 
skill in any direction. 
The carriage of a man who appears awkward to us is so because of the fact that 
he uses only a few muscles of his body, and holds the others under constraint, as 
though he possessed no power to use them. Freedom of body, which we term 
gracefulness, is manifested in the complete command of every limb by the will. 
This is the element of beauty in the Greek statuary. The gymnastic training 
may be easily recognized in a young man by his free carriage. As he moves he 
uses a greater variety of muscles than the man of uncultivated physique. It fol- 
lows that a muscle once trained to activity keeps itself in training, or even adds 
by degrees to its development, simply by demanding its daily exercise, and secur- 
ing it by some additional movement which it has added as subsidiary to activities 
in which other muscles are chiefly concerned. In his manner of sitting or rising, 
of walking or running, even of breathing, of writing, or reading, one man varies 
from another through the use or disuse of subsidiary muscles, thus kept in train- 
ing or allowed to remain as undeveloped rudiments. 
I have, in this protracted discussion of the significance of Froebel’s gifts as a 
preparation for industrial life, indicated my own grounds for believing that the 
kindergarten is worthy of a place in the common-school system. It should be a 
sort of subprimary education, and receive the pupil at the age of 4 or 44 years, and 
hold him until he completes his sixth year. By this means we gain the child for 
one or two years when he is good for nothing else but education, and not of much 
value even for the education of the school as it is and has been. The disciplines 
of reading and writing, geography and arithmetic, as taught in the ordinary pri- 
mary school, are beyond the powers of the average child not yet entered upon his 
seventh year. And beyond the seventh year the time of the child is too valuable 
to use it for other than general disciplines—reading, writing, arithmetic, etc., and 
drawing. He must not take up his school time with learning a handicraft. 
The kindergarten utilizes a period of the child’s life for preparation for the arts 
and trades, without robbing the school of a portion of its needed time. 
Besides the industrial phase of the subject, which is pertinent here, we may 
take note of another one that bears indirectly on the side of productive industry, 
but has a much wider bearing. At the age of 3 years the child begins to emerge 
from the circumscribed life of the family, and to acquire an interest in the life of 
society, and a proclivity to form relationship with it. This increases until the 
school period begins, at his seventh year. The fourth, fifth, and sixth years are 
years of transition, not well provided for either by family life or by social life in 
the United States. In families of great poverty, the child forms evil associations 
on the street, and is initiated into crime. By the time he is ready to enter the 
school he is hardened in vicious habits, beyond the power of the school to eradi- 
cate. In families of wealth, the custom is to intrust the care of the child in this 
period of his life to some servant without pedagogical skill, and generally without 
strength of will power. The child of wealthy parents usually inherits the supe- 
rior directive power of the parents, who have by their energy acquired and pre- 
served the wealth. Its manifestation in the child is not reasonable, considerate 
will power, but arbitrariness and self-will—with such a degree of stubbornness 
that it quite overcomes the much feebler native will of the servant who has charge 
of the children. It is difficult to tell which class (poor or rich) the kindergarten
-P-A-G-E-984
  904 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
benefits most. Society is benefited by the substitution of a rational training of 
the child’s will during his transition period. If he is a child of poverty, he is 
saved by the good associations and the industrial and intellectual training that 
he gets. If heisa child of wealth, he is saved by the kindergarten from ruin 
through self-indulgence and the corruption ensuing on weak management in the 
family. The worst elements in the community are the corrupted and ruined men 
who were once youth of unusual directive power—children of parents of strong 
wills. a 
The kindergarten will give the physical aptitude for manual skill. After the 
common-school education is finished, the ‘‘manual-training school ” will complete 
the preparation for a trade. In the ‘‘school shops,” as the manual-training 
schools are sometimes called, the pupil learns how to use the various tools which 
belong to most of the industries—the ax, saw, plane, auger, hammer, square, 
chisel, and file. There are very many tools, but they are for the most part only 
applications of these few instruments. 
Cost oF TUITION IN THE KINDERGARTEN. 
The total amount of salaries in this department for the 131 paid teachers was 
$21,860; average number of pupils belonging in the kindergartens was 3,841, 
making the average cost per pupil $5.70; cost for each of the 6,202 pupils enrolled, 
$3.52. :

The cost of tuition in the kindergarten for 1875-76 was, for each pupil belong- 
ing, $11.86; for each pupil enrolled, $5.76. For 1876-77, for each pupil belonging, 
$9; for each pupil enrolled, $4.05. 
This shows a constant reduction in the cost of instruction in the kindergarten, 
and forms a very important consideration in the question of the introduction or 
continuance of the kindergarten in the public-school system. 
The average cost of tuition in all the schools is $16.73 for each pupil belonging, 
and $11.78 for each pupil enrolled in the course of the year. 8 
In my report for 1875-76 I have discussed the several questions relative to the 
course of study and management of the kindergarten, and in my report for 1876-77 
T have given extended statistics as to results. 
As the kindergarten has now been in operation for six years, and on a very 
extended scale, the time has arrived when the subject may be discussed in the 
light of experience, and satisfactory conclusions reached as to the advisability of 
continuing and extending the system thus far developed. 
The history of the establishment of the kindergarten with us is perhaps of suffi- 
cient interest to be rehearsed here. 
1, From the report of the superintendent for 1870-71: 
The average duration of the school life of a child in manufacturing districts is 
only three entire years. Commencing at the age of 7, he completes his school edu- 
cation at10. If he could be properly cared for in school at 5 years of age his school 
life reed last five years. This period would suffice to make a durable impression 
on his life. 
The exclusion of pupils under 7 years of age, to which I have alluded in previous 
reports, still continues, but not to such an extent as formerly. In certain sections 
of the city where the influences are corrupting to the children, they being obliged
-P-A-G-E-985
  HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 905 
to play on the street, it is decidedly better to have them in school at an early age, 
and to so far modify the tasks imposed on them as to prevent overstraining their 
delicate organisms. The kindergarten system of culture for the young is justly 
receiving much attention from educators everywhere. To it we must look for 
eee hints on the method of conducting our instruction in the lowest primary 
grades. 
The establishment of an experimental kindergarten was accordingly recom- 
mended. It got no further, however, than the experiment made at the Everett 
Primary School, wherein some of the features of the kindergarten were adopted. 
2. Colonel Rombauer introduced a resolution, in November, 1871, into the board, 
appointing a committee for a report on ‘‘play schools.” 
This committee reported March 12, 1872, as follows (the report being laid over): 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON PLAY SCHOOLS. 
To the President and Board of Directors of St. Lowis Public Schools: 
An investigation into the merits of play schools, their practical operation in 
other places, and the earnest enthusiasm of all supporters of their institution, has 
convinced your committee that our public-school system can no doubt beimproved 
in that direction. However, though highly recommended, the play school has 
nowhere found a general application. An institution of this description, under 
the direction of Prof. A. Douai, of Newark, N. J., is the only one which enjoys the 
direct support of the public-school authorities. This play school is in a flourishin 
condition, and the subsequent success of its pupils in the district schools is state 
sy be most satisfactory, as these pupils are almost invariably at the head of their 
classes. 
While a great many children do not enjoy the advantages of the supervision and 
guidance of parents whose intellectual culture, pecuniary means, and business 
relations would permit to give the necessary time, or to secure playgrounds, play- 
mates, and playthings which would invite the full bodily and mental activity of 
the child, institutions which, by association and combination of means, can secure 
these desired facilities must be highly commendable. 
From the reviewed and digested experience of others, your committee has come 
to the conclusion that an educational institution preceding the day education of 
the district schools, dealing with children at the tender age when they are most 
susceptible for lasting impressions, should try to attain, besides its negative bene- 
fits, the following positive objects: 
1. To develop the individuality of the child sufficiently that the same should not 
be obliterated by subsequent class education. 
.2. To shape its character, and train it to perseverance, strength, and mental 
vigor. 
5 To elicit talents, independent action, and leading tendencies of mind, by giv- 
ing them the opportunity of, and by inviting, their expression. 
4, To acquaint the child with nature and its forces through play. 
5. To lead the child to habits of order, classification, and system. 
6. To give the child a taste for beauty as the best safeguard against vice. 
7. To give the child ample exercise and the surroundings of health, 
The above objects can be advanced to no inconsiderable extent by the institution 
of play schools, and this influence will aid our district-school system beyond 
expectation. However, no definite method in their administrations and no definite 
system in their organization has yet been arrived at. For this reason a practical 
test of the system in our own midst, and under the supervision of the board and 
its officers, would appear to be most desirable. It should be also ascertained 
whether there is an actual demand for an institution of that kind in our community. 
In one sense the whole of life is an education, for man is a being that constantly 
develops—for good or evil. In every epochof his life an education goes on. There 
are well-defined epochs of growth or of. education; that of infancy, in which 
education is chiefly that of use and want, the formation of habits as regards the 
care of the person, and the conduct within family life; that of youth, wherein the 
child learns in the school how to handle those instrumentalities which enable 
him to participate in the intellectual or theoretical acquisitions of the human race, 
and wherein, at the same time, he learns those habits of industry, regularity and 
punctuality, and self-control, which enable him to combine with his fellow-men

in civil society and in the State; then there is that education which follows the 
period of school education—the education which one gets by the apprenticeship to 
a vocation or calling in life. Other spheres of education are the State, or body 
politic, and its relation to the individual, wherein the latter acts as a citizen, mak- 
ing laws through his elected representatives, and assisting in their execution; the 
church, wherein he learns to see all things under the form of eternity, and to 
derive thence the ultimate standards of his theory and practice in life. 
Before Miss Blow’s experiment in the Des Peres School the kindergarten was 
only a vague dream in the St. Louis schools. Since that time the following has

The question of the kindergarten can not be settled without considering many 
subordinate questions. 
Your committee therefore recommend to aid such an institution with means, 
provided citizens taking an interest in similar educational institutions will give a 
practical expression to such interest by also aiding the same with their private 
means, 
Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolutions: 
1. That $1,000 are hereby appropriated for the institution of a play school, pro- 
vided private citizens furnish a similar amount for the same purpose. 
2. That the institution and the funds created as above shall be under the con- 
trol ot ene president, superintendent, and chairman of the teachers’ committee of 
the board. 
3. That the objects of that school shall be the same as expressed in this report. 
4, That admission to said play school shall be free. 
5. That the citizens contributing to the establishment of that play school may 
select its locality, and elect an advisory committee for its management. 
6. That the superintendent of the public schools shall report from time to time 
upon its condition and progress.

8. From superintendent’s report for 1871-72: 
From his third year, the child begins to widen the sphere of his activity so much 
as to extend it beyond the family influence. Through play he comes in contact 
with children of other families; and soon after this commences he needs the 
counterbalancing influences of the school, Through contact with other children 
in play—especially where, as happens in cities, the street is the place of this 
association—his will develops powerfully, and something more is needed for its 
control than the mere family nurture. . 
The régime of the school (more general than that of the family) is needed to 
prevent arbitrariness and caprice, and to secure the growth of proper respect for 
elders, and for moral and civil ordinances. That threefold reverence which 
Goethe speaks of as the basis of all higher life—reverence for superiors, for equals, 
and for inferiors—is very difficult to inculcate if the child remains too long under 
family influence, without the training of the school. School discipline is found to 
be far more potent when applied at the age of 5 than at the age of 8 years. 
I hope another year will witness the formation of a sufficient number of small

primary schools—founded more or lesson the kindergarten plan—to accommodate all of the localities situated near the river and in our manufacturing districts. A 
genuine kindergarten, as an experiment, would furnish additional hints to our 
teachers and suggestions to the board, enough to doubly repay the cost of its 
support. 
{ 4, From superintendent’s report for 1872-73: 
' We do not look so much to the gain in intellectual possessions as to the training 
of the will into correct habits during the years previous to the seventh. After his 
third year the child becomes social, and hungers for companionship. In the 
school he can secure this with less danger to him than on the street. Such care- 
ful training in habits of regularity, punctuality, industry, cleanliness, self-control, 
and politeness as are given in the ordinary primary school and still more efficiently 
in the well-conducted kindergarten, are of priceless benefit to the community. 
They lessen the number of rough, ungovernable youths, whose excesses are the 
menace of the peace of society. 
The offer of Miss Susie E. Blow to undertake gratuitously the instruction of one 
teacher appointed by the board, and to supervise and manage a kindergarten, 
provided the board would furnish the rooms and a salaried teacher, was accepted; 
and in the report of the teachers’ committee, August 26, 1873, it was recom- 
mended— 
That room No, 4 of the Des Peres School be devoted for the present year to the 
purpose of ascertaining, by a faithful experiment, what valuable features the 
kindergarten may have that can be utilized in our primary schools; and, for this 
purpose, that Miss Mary A. Timberlake be assigned to this room, with rank of 
first assistant; and that Miss Susie E. Blow, having proffered her services gratui- 
tously, thesame be accepted, and the school be placed under her control and super- 
vision.

The question of the kindergarten also involves, besides this one of province— 
i. e., the question whether there is a place for it—the consideration of its disci- 
plines, or what it accomplishes in the way of theoretical insight or of practical 
will power; these two, and the development of the emotional nature of the human 
being. Exactly what does the kindergarten attempt to do in these directions? 
And then, after the what it does is ascertained, arises the question whether it is 
desirable to attempt such instruction in the school; whether it does not take the 
place of more desirable training, which the school has all along been furnishing; 
or whether it does not, on the other hand, trench on the province of the education 
within the family, a period of nature wherein the pupil gets most of his internal 
or subjective emotional life developed? If the kindergarten takes the child too 
soon from the family and abridges the period of nature, it must perforce injure his 
character on the whole; for the period of nurture is like the root life of the plant, 
essential for the development of the above-ground life of the plant, essential for 
the public life of the man, the life wherein he combines with his fellow-men. 
Then, again, there is involved the question of education for vocation in life— 
the preparation for the arts and trades that are to follow school life—as the third 
epoch inlife education. Should the education into the technicalities of vocations 
be carried down into the school life of the pupil; still more, should it be carried 
down into the earliest period of transition from the nurture period to the school 
period? : 
Besides these essential questions, there are many others of a subsidiary nature— 
those relating to expense, to the training of teachers and their supply, to the abil- 
ity of public-school boards to manage such institutions, to the proper buildings 
i
-P-A-G-E-988
  
  908 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
for their use, the proper length of sessions, the degree of strictness of discipline 
to be preserved, etc. The former essential questions relate to the desirability of 
kindergarten education; the latter relate to the practicability of securing it. 
The most enthusiastic advocates of the kindergarten offer, as grounds for its 
establishment, such claims for its efficiency as might reasonably be claimed only 
for the totality of human education, in its five-fold aspect—of nurture, school, 
vocation, State, and church. If what they claim for it were met with as actual 
results, we certainly should realize the fairest ideals of a perfected type of human- 
ity at once. Such claims, however, can be made only of a lifelong education in 
its five-fold aspect, and not of any possible education which lasts only from one to 
four years in the life of the individual. Notwithstanding this exaggeration, it 
may prove to be the case that the kindergarten is justified in claiming a province 
heretofore unoccupied by the school or by family nurture, and a province which 
is of the utmost importance to the right development of those phases of life which 
follow it. It is, indeed, no reproach to the friends of the ‘“‘new education” (as 
they call it) toaccuse them of exaggeration. The only fault which we may charge 
them with is a tendency to ignore or underrate the educational possibilities of the 
other provinces of human life, and especially those of the school as it has hitherto 
existed.! 
1 To illustrate the breadth of view which the advocates of the kindergarten entertain in regard 
to the theory and practical value of the kindergarten, I quote here a statement of its rationale, 
furnished me by Miss Elizabeth Peabody, justly considered the leading advocate for the new 
education in this country: 
“The rationale of Froebel’s method of education is only to be given by a statement of the 
eternal laws which organize human nature on the one side and the material universe on the 
other. 
“Human nature and the material universe are related contrasts, which it is the personal life 
of every human being to unify. Material nature is the unconscious manifestation of God, and 
includes the human body, with which man finds himself in relation so vital that he takes part 
in perfecting it by means of the organs; and this part of nature is the only part of nature 
which can be said to be dominated vitally by man, who, in the instance of Jesus Christ, so puri- 
fied it by never violating any law of human nature—which (human nature) is God’s intentional 
revelation of Himself to each—that He seems to have had complete dominion, and could make 
Himself visible or invisible at will; transfiguring His natural body by His spiritual body, as on 
the Mount of Transfiguration; or consuming it utterly, as on the Mount of Ascension. Whether 
man, in this atmosphere, will ever do this, and thus abolish natural death, or not, there is no 
doubt there will be infinite approximation to this glorification of humanity in proportion as 
education does justice to the children, as Froebel’s education aims to doit; for it is his princi 
ple to lead children to educate themselves from the beginning—like Socrates’s demon—forbid 
ding the wrong and leaving the self-activity free to goodness and truth, which it is destined to 
pursue forever and ever.” 
A writer in the Canadian School Journal gives utterance to the following estimate of the 
value of kindergartens: 
“ Graduated from a true kindergarten, a child rejoices in an individual self-poise and power 
which makes his own skill and judgment important factors of his future progress. He is not 
like every other child who has been in his class; he is himself. His own genius, whatever it 
may be, has had room for growth and encouragement to express itself. He therefore sees 
some object in his study, some purpose in his effort. Everything in his course has been illumi- 
nated by the same informing thought; and, therefore, with the attraction that must spring up 
in the young mind from the use of material objects in his work, instead of a weariness, his way 
has been marked at every step bya buoyant happiness and an eager interest. Any system that 
produces such results is educationally a good system. But when you add that all this has been 
done so naturally and so judiciously that the child has derived as much physical as mental 
advantage, and an equally wholesome moral development, who can deny that it is superior to 
any other yet devised or used, and that, as such, it is the inalienable birthright of every child 
to be given the advantages of its training? * * * Before the time of Froebel, the science of 
pedagogics was founded upon abstruse thought, although sometimes introducing—as in the 
various object systems—the concrete form as a means of education; but Froebel, by a Divine 
inspiration, laid aside his books, wherein theory mystified theory, and studied the child. 
“He said, God will indicate to us in the native instincts of His creature the best method for its 
development and governance. He watched the child at its play and at its work. He saw that 
it was open to impressions from every direction; that its energies were manifested by unceasing
-P-A-G-E-989
  HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 909 
The disciples of Froebel everywhere see the world in this way. With them the 
theory of the kindergarten is the theory of the world of man and nature. Froebel 
himself was as much a religious (or moral) enthusiast as a pedagogical reformer. 
The moral regeneration of the race is the inspiring ideal which his followers aim 
to realize. 
Ido not disparage this lofty ideal; it is the ideal which every teacher should 
cherish. No other one is a worthy one for the teacher of youth! But I think that 
any gifted teacher in our district schools, our high schools, or our colleges may, 
as reasonably as the teacher of the kindergarten, have this lofty expectation of 
the moral regeneration of the race to follow from his teachings. If the child is 
more susceptible at the early age when he enters the kindergarten, and it is far 
easier then to mold his personal habits, his physical strength and skill, and his 
demeanor toward his equals and his superiors, yet, on the other hand, the high- 
school teacher or the college professor comes into relation with him when he has 
begun to demand for himself an explanation of the problem of life, and it is possi- 
ble, for the first time, at this age to lead him to insight—the immediate philosoph- 
ical view of the universality and necessity of principles. 
Insight is the faculty of highest principles, and of course more important than 
all other theoretical disciplines. It is therefore probable that the opportunity of 
the teacher who instructs pupils at the age of 16 years and upward is, on an aver- 
age, more precious for the welfare of the individual than that of the teacher whose 
pupils are under 6 years. This advantage, however, the teacher of the youngest 
pupils has, that she may give them an influence that will cause them to continue 
their education in after life. The primary school, with its four years’ course, 
usually enrolls five pupils where the grammar school, with a course of four years, 
enrolls only one pupil. The importance of the primary school is seen in the fact 
that it affects a much larger proportion of the inhabitants of a community, while 
the importance of the high school rests on the fact that its education develops 
insight and directive power, so that its graduates do most of the thinking and 
planning that is done for the community. 
But there are special disciplines which the child of 5 years may receive profitably 
that the youth of 16 would not find sufficiently productive. I have already dis- 
cussed, under the topic of Evening Schools, the industrial training that the kinder- 
garten furnishes. With the author’s permission, I make the following extracts 
from an admirable (unpublished) lecture by Miss Susan E. Blow—to whom our 
kindergartens are so deeply indebted—on the subject of the several phases of the 
kindergarten education which form its distinctive features of contrast with other 
education: 
THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THE GIFTS AND OCCUPATIONS, 
Let a child try to fashion his lump of clay into a bird’s nest, and, though his 
effort yield no other result, it will certainly lead him to examine carefully the next 
bird’s nest he sees. Let him make an apple and a pear, and he must feel their 
difference in form as he would never have done had he simply looked at the two 
curiosity and unceasing restlessness; that, if left to itself, the impossibility of reaching any sat- 
isfactory conclusions in its researches little by little stifled its interest; the eager desire to 
explore deeply the world of ideas and objects before him passed into a superficial observation, 
heeding little and sure of nothing. He saw that the law which made it flit from object to object 
in this unceasing motion was a law of development implanted by God, and therefore good; but 
that, unless it were directed and given aim and purpose, it became an element of mischief as 
well. Then what could be done? How was the possible angel to be developed and the possible 
devil to be deteated? Froebel said: ‘If we take God's own way, we must be right; so let us 
direct into a systematic but natural course of employment all these tender fancies, these fear- 
Jess little hands and feet, and these precious little eager souls; and then we shall work with the 
divine love and intelligence and it with us, and our children shall find the good and avoid the 
evil.’ Then year was added to year of thought and study and practice, until he gave his system 
to the world in its present completed form.”

fruits. Let him attempt to lay with his sticks the outline of a house, and his 
attention can not fail to be caught by facts of direction and proportion. Let him 
apply numbers in weaving, and their relations grow interesting tohim. Lead him 
to construct symmetrical figures, and he must feel the laws of symmetry. Teach 
him rhythmic movements, and he must recognizerhythm. All things are revealed 
in the doing, and productive activity both enlightens and develops the mind. 
It has always been a difficult problem to strike the balance between knowledge 
and power. The mind is not a sponge, nor is education the absorption of facts. 
On the other hand, nothing is more dangerous than energy uncontrolled by knowl- 
edge and insight. The mind, like the stomach, suffers from overloading, yet both 
need constant food. The test of healthy assimilation is increasing strength, and 
we know we are supplying the mind with the right kind and amount of food if wo 
notice a gain in vigor and originality. The child’s intense play is nature’s effort 
to order the thronging impressions of the first years of life, and the kindergarten 
simply follows nature in alternating receptive and creative activities and in con- 
stantly registering the results of perception in reproduction. 
In an age so analytical and scientific as our own, the kindergarten has a special 
value. Scientific methods need to be supplemented in education by artistic proc- 
esses. The scientist, beginning with the embodied fact, seeks its relations and its 
causes; the thought of the artist is the final cause of the statue, the painting, or 
the poem. The scientist, ‘‘handicapped by fact and riveted to matter,” strug- 
gles painfully toward the spiritual, while before the artist the invisible is con- 
stantly shaping the visible and the eternal declaring itself in the transitory. The 
restless scientist strives to order a bewildering variety; the artist instinctively 
realizes the unity from which variety is evolved, and feels the soul of the whole 
animating each particular part. We prepare the children for spiritual insight 
when we lead them to create. 
Again, the representative system is death to superficiality and self-conceit. The 
child’s imperfect results teach him humility, and stir him to fresh effort. He is 
constantly testing his perceptions by production, and measuring himself by his 
attainment. He learns that what he can use is his; that only what he consciously 
holds he truly possesses. He finds out in what directions he can best work, and 
transforms uncomprehended tendency into definite character. He advances, on 
the one hand, from perception to conception, from conception to reproduction, 
from reproduction to definition; and, on the other, from an instinctive to a self- 
directing activity, and from this to self-knowledge and self-control. Thus, by 
ne same process, he unlocks creation and realizes in himself the image of his 
reator. 
The order of the kindergarten gifts follows the order of mental evolution; and 
at each stage of the child’s growth, Froebel presents him with his ‘‘ objective 
counterpart.” ‘‘The child,” he says, ‘‘ develops, like all things, according to laws 
as simple as they are imperative. Of these, the simplest and most imperative is: 
That force existing must exert itself; exerting itself, it grows strong; strengthen- 
ing, it unfolds; unfolding, it represents and creates; representing and creating, 
it lifts itself to consciousness and culminates in insight.” This perception of the 
course of development determines his idea of the stages of early education, It 
should aim, first, to strengthen the senses and muscles, conceived as the tools of 
the spirit; second, to prepare for work by technical training, and to aid self- 
expression by supplying objects which, through their indefiniteness, may be made 
widely representative; third, to provide material adapted to the conscious pro- 
duction of definite things, and diminish the suggestiveness of this material in 
direct ratio to the increase of creative power; and, fourth, by analysis of the 
objects produced, and the method of their production, lift the child to conscious 
communion with his own thought. The first stage of this educational process is 
realized through the songs for mother and child; the second, through the kinder- 
garten games, the simpler occupations, and the first two gifts; the third, through 
the exercises with blocks, tablets, slats, sticks, and rings, and the work in draw- 
ing, folding, cutting, peas work, and modeling; and the fourth, through the wise 
appeal of the kindergartener to the thought of the child, as she leads him slowly 
from the what to the how, and from the how to the why and wherefore of his own 
action. 
The definitely productive exercises begin with the third gift. Froebel contends 
that the proverbial destructiveness of children is a perversion of the faculties of 
investigation and construction, and that the broken toys strewn over our nursery 
floors express the mind’s impatient protest against finished and complicated things. 
Unable to rest in externals, the child breaks his toys to find out ‘‘ what is inside,” 
and, scornful of what makes no appeal to his activity, he turns from the most 
elegant playthings to the crude results of his own manufacture. What he wants 
   
-P-A-G-E-991
HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. OEE 
is, not something made for him, but material to make something himself. What 
he needs is an object which he can take to pieces without destroying, and through 
which he can gratify his instinct to transform and to reconstruct. 
At the same time, the possibilities of the object must not be too varied, and it 
must be suggestive through its limitations. The young mind may be as easily 
crushed by excess as it is paralyzed by defect. Hence Froebel’s choice of a cube 
divided into eight smaller cubes. It is easily separated into its elements, and 
easily reconstructed. It is capable of a reasonable number of transformations, 
and its crude resemblances satisfy the child’s crude thought. It offers no variety 
of form to confuse his mind, but rigidly confines him to vertical and horizontal, 
to the right angle and the square. Moreover, he can scarcely arrange his blocks 
in any way without their taking forms which will suggest some object he has 
seen. If he piles them one above the other, a word from mother or kindergartener 
enables him to see in the unsought result of his doings a tower, a light-house, or 
alamp-post. If he arranges them side by side, he is confronted with a wall; if 
in two parallel rows, behold the railroad. The change of a single block trans- 
forms the railroad into a train of cars; and, with another movement, the cars 
vanish in a house. Having, as it were, reached these results accidentally, the 
child next directly aims to reproduce them; and thus, through the suggestiveness 
of his material, is helped from an instinctive to a self-directing activity, and from 
simple energy to definite production. This point once attained, he triumphs over 
more and more complicated material, and constrains an ever-increasing variety 
of elements to obey his thought. With planes and sticks he advances to surface 
representation, and prepares the way for drawing, and finally begins, of himself, 
to form letters and to spell out the names of familiar things. 
His progress, like that of the race, moves thus from the concrete to the abstract, 
from the fact to the picture, and from the picture to the sign. Through analysis 
of their productions the children are slowly awakened to facts of form and rela- 
tions of number, and led to the clear and precise use of language. As they grow 
older, the analysis becomes more definite and extended; and whereas the baby 
beginners only name the objects they produce, the more advanced children tell 
how they make each object, and the graduating class must be able to resolve 
whatever they create into its elements, and state the facts of form, number, direc- 
tion, and relation which it illustrates. I consider this final stage very important, 
for the reason that it makes clear to the mind the meaning of all its experiences, 
and leads from the particular fact to the principle governing all the facts of the 
given class, 
With children who have completed the pure kindergarten course the gifts may 
be profitably used to teach the rudiments of geometry and arithmetic. The geo- 
metric forms are first recognized, then sought under their veiled manifestations 
in nature, then applied in construction, then consciously produced, clearly ana- 
lyzed, and sharply defined, and finally shown in their relations to each other. 
Thus the child who begins by simply calling his building blocks ‘‘ cubes” will 
end by recognizing in his cube the solid, the polyhedron, the hexahedron, the 
prism, and the parallelopiped, and will comprehend its precise definition as a 
rectangular parallelopiped whose faces are equal squares. So, beginning by point- 
ing out the square corners of his cube, he ends with the definite conception of a 
right angle, as produced when two straight lines meet each other so as to make 
the adjacent anglesequal. Allthesimple problems of geometry may be illustrated 
to perception and grasped as matters of fact, and the mind thus be prepared for 
the geometrical reasoning of later years. 
It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the evident adaptation of the gifts to the teach- 
ing of arithmetic. Infinitely varied exercises in counting and in the four funda- 
mental rules may be given with sticks, while the divided solids offer striking 
illustrations of fractional parts. Halves, quarters, and eighths must grow clear 
through the right use of the third and fourth gifts, while the fifth and sixth lead 
on in their natural division to thirds, ninths, and twenty-sevenths, and may also 
be used to illustrate halves, quarters, sixths, and twelfths, The salient features 
of the method used are: (1) To excite interest in the relations of numbers, rather 
than to give mechanical drill; (2) to constantly associate number and form, 
making them mutually illustrative; (8) to apply numbers to mechanical and 
artistic production. Whereas, in the kindergarten proper, the child abstracted 
from his productions numerical facts, he now directly seeks in his constructions 
to solve numerical problems. To illustrate: With a given number of blocks the 
children are required to build a house of stated height, breadth, and thickness, 
with a fixed number of windows and doors of definite dimension, and, having 
built it, to calculate its square and cubic contents. With their tablets they make 
squares, oblongs, rhombs, etc., of different sizes, noting length, breadth, and con-

tents; or with their sticks develop symmetrical figures from different mathemat- 
ical centers, calculating themselves the number of sticks required for each new 
addition. Gradually they grow capable of abstract exercises, and, far from find- 
ing vexation in multiplication and madness in fractions, their lessons in arithmetic 
are to them a delight axd an inspiration. 
From this imperfect survey of the gifts let us turn now to the occupations. 
These are perforating, sewing, drawing, intertwining, weaving, folding, cutting, 
peas work, cardboard and clay modeling. 
The perforating tool is a sharp needle fastened into a wooden handle. Holding 
this in a perfectly vertical position, the child pricks small round holes in paper. 
Little children are provided with drawings in bold lines, and by perforating these 
lines produce on the opposite side of the paper a raised outline of the drawn fig- 
ure. As they grow more expert, they produce pictures in relief by delicately per- 
forating the surface between the lines. They also receive paper marked off in 
squares, and, first pricking the corners of these squares, and then by careful per- 
forations connecting these corners, obtain vertical and horizontal lines of different 
lengths. These are next united to form figures, and as the eye gains accuracy and 
the hand precision, advance is made to slanting and curved lines and their com- 
binations. . 
Squared paper perforated only at the corners, and outline pictures perforated 
at distances of about the eighth of an inch, give the basis of the sewing exercises. 
Armed with worsted and an embroidery needle, the child connects the corners of 
the paper and works various combinations of lines, or carefully retraces the out- 
lines of pictures. The salient feature in the new occupation is variety of color, 
and through this simple work the harmonies and contrasts of color may be indi- 
cated and the attention directed to the colors of natural objects. 
Sewing and pricking culminate in drawing, which again emphasizes both com- 
binations of lines and representation of objects—hinting, on the one hand, the ele- 
ments of design and on the other the first principles of artistic reproduction. 
Beginning by copying the outlines they have laid with sticks, the children advance 
to reproduction of the figures resulting from combinations of tablets; and from 
these, first to front views, and finally to simple perspective representations of the 
solids and their transformations. As the first step in drawing is to learn to see 
correctly, it is evident that all the exercises, both in gifts and occupations, pre- 
pare for the use of pencil and chalk. As the mediation of word and object draw- 
ing is of vast importance in its reaction on the mind, and as the soul of all tech- 
nical processes, it is the indispensable basis of industrial education. 
The material for intertwining consists of strips of paper of different colors, 
lengths, and widths, which, folded lengthwise and plaited according to definite 
rules, represent a great variety of geometric and artistic forms. The plaiting by 
rule must, however, lead up to free combinations. 
In the occupation of mat plaiting the child weaves strips of paper into a leaf of 
paper cut into strips, but with a margin left at each end to keep the strips in place. 
Designs are not imitated from patterns, but produced by numerical combinations. 
In this mediation of number and form lies the special significance of the weaving 
exercises, which, however, are also valuable for cultivating the sense of color. 
The folding material consists of square, rectangular, and triangular pieces of 
paper, with which a variety of figures are produced by slight modifications of a 
few definite ground forms. Through this occupation ideas of sequence and con- 
nection are emphasized and the relation of mathematics to artistic production 
indicated. 
In the occupation of cutting, a square or triangle of paper is folded and cut by 
rule; and the pieces into which it is thus separated are combined in symmetric 
forms and mounted on a sheet of paper or cardboard. The child is also encour- 
aged to originate cuts. i 
By fastening sticks, sharpened at the ends, into peas soaked in water our little 
worker next produces the skeletons of real objects and of geometric forms. This 
occupation leads to close analysis of form, connects different solids with their cor- 
responding planes, and prepares for perspective drawing. 
While peas work throws into relief the outlines of objects, cardboard model- 
ing represents their surface boundaries, and clay work brings us back to the solid 
itself. By modifications of and additions to the sphere, cube, and cylinder, a 
variety of objects are represented; and these typical forms are more definitely 
recognized in the works of nature and of man. ; 
Taken as a whole, the occupations apply the principles suggested by the gifts, 
and give permanence to their vanishing transformations. _It will be observed that 
particular occupations connect with particular gifts. Thus, pricking, sewing, 
and drawing, which are essentially one, connect with the sticks and rings; inter-

twining and mat plaiting connect with the slats; folding and cutting with the 
tablets and peas work; cardboard and clay modeling with the undivided and 
divided solids of the first six gifts. It is also noticeable that while the gifts move 
from the solid to the surface, the line, and the point, the occupations, reversing 
this movement, develop from point to line, surface, and solid; and that while the 
determined material of the gifts limits to the combination and arrangement of 
unchangeable elements, the plastic material of the occupations is increasingly 
subservient to the modifying thought and touch of the embryo artist. 
As has been repeatedly said, the aim of the kindergarten is to strengthen and 
develop productive activity. But we must be conscious of ideas before we can 
express them, and we must gain the mastery of material before we can use it as a 
means of expression. Hence the first use of the gifts is to waken, by their sug- 
gestiveness, the mind’s sleeping thoughts, and the first use of the occupations to 
train the eye and the mind to be the ready servants of the will. While the child 
is still imitative in the occupations, he becomes inventive in the gifts; but as he 
grows to bé more and more a law unto himself, he turns from the coercion of his 
blocks, tablets, and sticks to obedient paper and clay, and, ultimately outgrowing 
the simpler occupations, concentrates his interest in the exercises of drawing, 
coloring, and modeling. These artistic processes, with a technical training 
according to the very successful Russian plan, might, it seems to me, be profit- 
ably introduced into our regular school course. 
The symbolism involved in all things—for in nature everything corresponds to 
spirit, and hence each lower material object is in some sense a key to unlock the 
perception of a higher, more subtle object—this symbolism is the basis of the 
intellectual value of the gifts of Froebel. No other educator since Plato’s time 
has understood so well the connection of the child’s first activities with his subse- 
quent ones and the significance of what is rudimentary as a preparation for what. 
is to follow. 
The following extracts (from another unpublished lecture by Miss Blow) point 
out this symbolical education as Froebel has intended it: 
THE SYMBOLIC PHASE OF EDUCATION, 
The instinct of children is to share the life around them. Little girls are eager 
to help in the work of the house—to sweep, dust, cook, sew, or do anything that. 
older people are doing. The boy will follow his father to the farm, to the forge, 
to the shop, and is proud and happy to be of the least use. How often do father 
and mother reject the weak but willing help of the little child! How often do 
they complain bitterly of the laziness, selfishness, and indifference of the older son 
or daughter! 
As the child’s interests and sympathies expand, he comes to notice the differ- 
ent activities of men, With the presentiment that he, too, is born to be a worker 
in the world, he eagerly watches the world’s work; and not content with watch- 
ing, he tries to imitate. The baby will try to follow the motions of those he sees 
working. The older child digs and plants, makes houses in the sand, floats his 
tiny boat on the water, and dams the stream to turn his toy mill. Froebel 
responds to the effort of the baby by a series of dramatic games representing the 
movements peculiar to different kinds of work, and to the need of the older child 
by the gifts and occupations of the kindergarten, through which he is enabled to 
imitate all kinds of technical and artistic processes. 
The importance of industrial education is every day more widely admitted. 
That Froebel has found the true beginning of technical training is also quite gen- 
erally recognized. It is one of the important features of the system that a defi- 
nite training of the hand is begun in babyhood. There are games to strengthen 
and give freedom to the wrist; there are games to discipline the muscles of the 
arm; there are games to teach force and flexibility to the fingers. The hand is 
man’s first and most important tool. It can not be too early taught to obey his 
thought and execute his will. We shall have no large class of skilled workmen 
until we learn from Froebel how to keep hands from growing clumsy and fingers: 
from getting stiff. 
The most fascinating feature of Froebel’s games to a thoughtful person is, how- 
ever, their reaction on thought. They are rooted, every one of them, in the rela- 
tionship of feeling, action, and thought; they obey without exception that deep 
law which connects instinct, expression, and insight. How, through their con- 
trasts, the activity of comparison is roused; how they quicken and intensify per- 
ception; what presentiments they create of the subtle relationships of sound and

movement; how they stir in the child the sense of proportion; how they show the 
soul of harmony in the relations of numbers; how they foreshadow even the mys- 
terious correspondences of space and time! All these things and many, many 
others can only be realized by those who, believing that in the night of uncon- 
sciousness slumber all the possibilities of the poet and the philosopher, will have 
patience to watch with Froebel for the dawning of the soul’s light. 
The opponents of the kindergarten have indulged in a great deal of scornful 
mirth over what they have been pleased to call its false and pernicious symbolism. 
Can that be seriously called an educational system, they ask, which allows balls 
to be called fishes and frogs, cats and squirrels; which sees in little matchlike 
sticks trees and lamp-posts and soldiers; which makes the same block stand for a 
house, a chair, and a sheep; and even uses the child’s fingers to represent his 
grandmother, his parents, and his brothers and sisters? 
Again, Froebel appeals from the scorn of his critics to the history of the race 
and the instinctive manifestations of the child, He hears untutored men call 
the brave man a lion, the meek man a lamb, the cunning man a fox. He hears 
the savage describe his face, not as round, but as moon; and says of his fruit that 
it is sugar cane, instead of saying that itis sweet. He finds among the monu- 
ments of ancient art three cubes standing side by side, inscribed with the names 
of the Three Graces. He studies reverently Egypt’s great unsolved problems as 
they are imaged in the Pyramids and the Sphinx. He reads the spirit’s faint intui- 
tion of immortality in the mysterious phenix. Finding everywhere that.man has 
sought to express in symbols the truth he feels, but does not understand, he turns 
his eyes upon the child, to seek in his instinctive life another parallel with the 
development of mankind. At once he notices the tendency of childhood to detect 
and delight in the most remote resemblances. ‘‘ Father and mother stars,” calls 
out a 2-year-old baby on seeing in the sky two large, bright stars in the midst 
of a number of smallones. ‘‘ Dust on the water,” exclaimsa boy of 4, as, standing 
on the seashore, he is blinded by the mist and spray. ‘Let me catch the bird,” 
cries the little girl, as she watches with delight the flickering reflection of the sun- 
light on the wall. Mlustrations might be multiplied, but we do not need them. 
We have all seen the boy ride his father’s cane, and call it a horse; we have 
watched many a little girl caress the towel she has rolled and wrapped for her 
baby; we know how, to the imagination of the child, ‘‘the rose leans over to kiss 
baby Se and ‘God sends the little star baby, ’cause the moon was so lonely 
in the sky.” 
The symbolic stage of thought is characterized by the perception of resem- 
blances without abstraction of the qualities in which the resemblance lies. When 
the child calls the quivering reflection of the sunlight a bird, he shows us that he 
has been struck chiefly with the bird’s swift motion, but at the same t™me has not 
learned to consider motion as an abstraction. 
So, too, it is through the creeping, swimming, and climbing motions that he 
identifies the cat, the fish, and the squirrel with his ball. His sticks stand for 
trees, lamp-posts, and soldiers through the quality of straightness; and his many 
fingers on one hand suggest the merging of father, mother, and children in the 
unity of the family. 
It is a fact full of deep meaning that the obscure thought or feeling recognizes 
itself in. a symbol, and can not recognize itself in a definite and exact reflection. 
We need a mirror, not of what we are, but of what we already dimly see our- 
selves to be. This is the reason that the child’s life grows clearer to him through 
the life of birds and animals than through the human life around him. He is 
drawn closer to his mother by watching the cat with her kittens, or the mother 
bird with her young, than he is by seeing other children with their mothers. It is 
no idle curiosity which bids him peer into the bird’s nest and watch so intently 
while the mother bird feeds her young or covers them with her sheltering wings. 
He is fascinated, because thus his own life is made objective to him; his own rela- 
tionships are shown to him in symbol. 
The child not only expresses himself symbolically, but is quick to interpret the 
symbolism of nature. And if, on the one hand, we recognize that he must repre- 
sent before he can understand, and know that tho analogies which underlie his 
action will in due course develop comparison and abstraction, can we doubt, on 
the other, that the types of nature will reveal their archetypes and the material 
symbol vanish in the spiritual reality? Looking into the past, we find that all the 
phenomena of nature have been worshiped by. men; that the human heart has 
bowed itself to sun and moon, to mountains and rivers, to beasts, and even to 
the most disgusting reptiles. We remember the thunders and lightning of Sinai, 
the mystery of the burning bush, and the pillar of cloud and of fire. We know 
that to-day the oldest of Christian churches celebrates her mysteries in symbolic.
-P-A-G-E-995
  
HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 915 
forms and services; and the universal heart of Christendom concentrates its 
deepest feelings and intuitions in the symbol of the cross. From all these things 
may we not infer deep analogies between the outer and the inner world—between 
. the truths God writes in human hearts and those He proclaims through the thou- 
sand voices of earth—and believe that by a process we can not trace the mind 
may move from the perception of the symbol to the conscious realization of the 
truth symbolized? Such, at least, was Froebel’s firm conviction; and we find 
him, consequently, in many of his little plays directing attention to the natural 
symbols of great truths—leading the child to love the light, teaching him rever- 
ence for unseen forces, making him feel the unity that underlies variety, and 
stirring within him a prophetic certainty of complete self-recognition. 
A single illustration must suffice to indicate this phase of Froebel’s thought. 
To many, I fear, it will prove a stumbling-block; to many others, foolishness. 
To those only will it commend itself who, realizing that all things are connected, 
know that nothing is insignificant. 
“Tt is my firm conviction,” writes he, ‘‘ that whatever gives the child pure and 
persistent pleasure is, however remotely, connected with some deep truth of his 
nature, and has in it a germ of highest possibilities. 
“Tn the light of this faith, look at the shadow pictures on the ‘wall! 
«Between the bright light which shines on the smooth, white wall is thrust a 
dark object, and straightway appears the form which so delights the child. This 
is the outward fact. What is the truth which through this fact is dimly hinted 
to the prophetic mind? Is it not the creative and transforming power of light— 
that power which brings form and color out of dark chaos, and makes the beauty 
which gladdens our hearts? Is it not more than this—a foreshadowing, perhaps, 
of the spiritual fact that our darkest experiences may project themselves in forms 
that will delight and bless, if back of them, in our hearts, shines the light of God? 
Stern, bare rocks and forbidding clefts grow beautiful in the sunlight, and the 
fairest landscape loses life, beauty, and expression in the darkness. Is it not thus 
also with our lives? Yesterday they seemed to us full of beauty and hope; 
to-day we see nothing but struggle and pain. Yesterday we felt within us great 
possibilities ; to-day we stagger under doubts and groan in the darkness of our 
souls. Only clear conviction that it is the darkness within us which makes the 
darkness without, and that all lives are beautiful when lived in the light of God’s 
idea of them, can restore the lost peace of our souls, Be it, therefore, O mother, 
your sacred duty to make your child feel early the working both of the outer and 
theinner light! Let him see in one the symbol of the other, and tracing form and 
color to their sourcein the sun, may he learn to trace the beauty and the meaning 
of his life to their source in God!” 
The analogy between light and truth has always been most deeply felt by the 
most spiritual minds. ‘‘The magi said of God that He had light for His body and 
truth for His soul.” The psalmist exclaims, ‘‘Thou hast covered Thyself with 
light as with a garment.” Christ tells us that Godis Light, and in Him is no dark- 
ness at all; and St. John, writing of that state where we shall have done with all 
symbols, because completely penetrated with the realities they represent, declares 
that ‘‘ the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon to lighten it.” 
' If the connection is thus real, will it not make itself felt? May not the heart of 
the child thrill, as the heart of mankind has done, in response to the objective 
expression of its inward need? May nota childhood of spiritual presentiments 
best prepare for a manhood of spiritual insights? 
As has been already repeatedly stated, Froebel’s life and thought were ruled by 
the idea of organic unity. That all-pervading law of organisms by which they 
progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, and realize the highest unity 
through the extreme of variety, was ever present to his mind, and his ideal conse- 
quently was the complete development of the individual man for the sake of all 
men. Therefore, he aimed through self-activity to develop powers, through 
love to consecrate them to service, through service to lift them into consciousness. 
To know himself man must feel and know all his relationships; and he learns the 
sweetness and solemnity of his life only by realizing its connections with nature, 
with man, and with God. 
In view of this vital truth, Froebel insists that from the beginning of life the 
child shall be led to see and feel connections and dependencies. As these connec- 
tions exist in the least things they can be shown in the least things, and the habit 
of mind thus formed will extend itself to greater things as the child’s powers 
strengthen and his experiences enlarge. An instinct of this connection underlies 
the favorite game of all nurseries, ‘‘pat-a-cake,” in which the mother shows the 
child that without the baker he could not have his cake. Froebel seizes this hint 
and develops it. For. the cake the child depends on the baker, the baker on the

miller, the miller on the farmer, the farmer on the sunshine and the rain. In 
another game, called grass-mowing, the same general idea is carried out. The 
motion of the game represents the mowing of the grass; the words tell how the baby 
loves milk, how the milk comes from the cow, the cow must be fed with the grass 
the mower reaps; God sends the sunlight and the rain to make the grass grow. In 
still another play Froebel unites in one all the little games the child has learned. 
I give the words which accompany this game, only adding that the particular 
motion associated with each separate game is repeated when that game is referred 
to. Thus the child connects his isolated experiences into a whole, and begins to 
organize his memories: 
MOTTO FOR THE MOTHER. 
‘“Whatever singly thou has played. 
May in one charming whole be made. 
The child alone delights to play, But better still with comrades gay. The single flower we love to view, Still more the wreath of varied hue. 
th this and all the child may find 
The least within the whole combined.” 
SONG. 
“Two hands! thereon eight fingers are; 
Two thumbs the two grandmothers are. They've come to make each other a call; *Tis long since they have met at all; They bid each other welcome. Oh, welcome! Oh, welcome! Such bowings and such greetings! 
Such glad and tender meetings! They talk as if they would never rest; They tell of the basket, the eggs in the nest; They tell of the doves and the pigeon-house, How they fly in and out in gay carouse. They tell of the little fishes gay, in the sparkling water floating away; The baker and little patty-cakes; The target the good brother makes. Now, when they’ve reviewed their plays all through, They ask each other what next they shall do. 
The fingers say, ‘To the steeple we'll go!’ But the little grandmothers they say, ‘No!’ In the church door the grandmothers go.” 
We build up the future on the past; we look back that we may move forward; 
‘we grow er eas what is to be by seeing clearly what has been. Hence the 
great value of history; hence, too, the strength of those who, from time to time, 
pause in life to collect the results of living. 
To most of us, however—perhaps to all of us—the first few years of life are a 
blank in memory. We wake to consciousness with definite feelings, thoughts, and 
tendencies. Whence sprang the feelings? How grew the thoughts? What fixed 
the tendencies? We askin vain. Over the sources of life roll the silent waves of 
unconsciousness, and memory loses itself in a beginning when ‘all was without 
form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.” 
TuE Limits OF THE KINDERGARTEN AS AN EDUCATIONAL APPLIANCE. 
While the industrial preparation involved in the kindergarten exercises is a 
sufficient justification for its introduction into our school system, it must be con- 
fessed that this is far from satisfactory to the enthusiastic disciples of Froebel. 
They see in the kindergarten the means for the moral regeneration of the human 
race, and they look upon the industrial phase of its results as merely incidental 
and of little consequence; and, indeed, they regard those who attempt to justify 
the kindergarten on an industrial basis as sordid materialists. That they have 
good reason to claim more than this preparation for manual arts is evident from 
the preceding extracts, in which Miss Blow has shown how the games, gifts, and 
occupations are symbolic, and thus propzdeutic to subsequent intellectual and 
moral training. Every conscious intellectual phase of the mind has a previous 
phase in which it was unconscious and merely symbolic. Feeling, emotion, sensi- 
bility—these are names of activities of the soul which become thoughts and ideas 
by the simple addition of consciousness to them; i. e., the addition of reflection. 
What smoke is to the clear flame in some sort is instinct to clear rational purpose. 
Thoughts and ideas preexist, therefore, as feelings and impulses; when later they
-P-A-G-E-997
  HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. OTF 
are seen as ideas they are seen as having general form or as possessing universal- 
ity. As feelings they are particular or special, having application only then and 
there; as thoughts they are seen as general principles regulative of all similar 
exigencies. 
The nursery tale gives the elements of a thought, but in such special grotesque 
forin that the child seizes only the incident. Subsequent reflection brings together 
the features thus detached and isolated, and the child begins to have a general 
idea, The previous symbol makes easy and natural the pathway to ideas and 
clear thought. 
Besides the industrial training (through the ‘gifts and occupations”) and the 
symbolic culture (derived chiefly from the ‘“‘games”), there is much else in the 
kindergarten which is common to the instruction in the school subsequently and 
occupies the same ground. Some disciplines also are much more efficient in the 
kindergarten by reason of its peculiar apparatus than the same are or can be in 
the common school, 
The instruction in manners and polite habits which goes on in all well-conducted 
kindergartens is of very great value. The child is taught to behave properly at 
the table, to be clean in his personal habits, to be neat in the arrangement of his 
apparatus, to practice the etiquette and amenities of polite life. These things are 
much better provided for in Froebel’s system than elsewhere. Moreover, there is 
a cultivation of imagination and of the inventive power which possesses great sig- 
nificance for the future intellectual growth. The habits of regularity, punctual- 
ity, silence, obedience to established rules, self-control are taught to as great a 
degree as is desirable for pupils of that age, but not by any means so perfectly as in 
the ordinary well-conducted primary school. The two kinds of attention that are 
developed so well in a good school (1) the attention of each pupil to his own task, 
so absorbed in it that he is oblivious to the work of the class that is reciting, and 
(2) the attention of each pupil in the class that is reciting to the work of the pupil 
reciting, the former being the attention of industry and the latter the attention 
of critical observation, are not developed so well as in the primary school, nor is 
it to be expected. The freedom from constraint, which is essential in the kinder- 
garten, or in any school for pupils of 5 years of age, allows much interference of 
each pupil with the work of others, and hence much distraction of attention. It 
is quite difficult to preserve an exact balance. The teacher of the kindergarten is 
liable to allow the brisk, strong-willed children to interfere with the others and 
occupy their attention too much. 
As regards imagination and inventive power, it is easily stimulated to an abnor- 
mal degree. For if it is accompanied by conceit, there is a corresponding injury 
done to the child’s faith and reverence which must accompany his growth if he 
would come to the stores of wisdom which his race has preserved for him. The 
wisest men are those who have availed themselves most of the wisdom of the race. 
Self-activity, it is true, is essential to the assimilation of the intellectual patri- 
mony; but it isa reverent spirit only that can sustain one in the long labor of 
mastering and acquiring that patrimony. 
The cultivation of language—of the power of expression—is much emphasized 
by the advocates of the kindergarten, and, I believe, with fair results. 
There is a species of philosophy sometimes connected with the system which 
undoubtedly exercises a great influence over the minds of the followers of Froebel. 
It is, apparently, a system founded on a thought of Schelling—the famous ‘iden- 
tity system ’—which made the absolute to be the indifference or identity of spirit 
and nature. Its defect is that it deals with antitheses as resolvable only into 
“indifference” points; hence the highest principle must be an unconscious one, 
which makes its philosophy a pantheistic system when logically carried out. But 
Froebel does not seem to have carried it out strictly. He uses it chiefly to build 
on it as a foundation his propeedeutics of reflection, or thinking activity. Antith- 
 
-P-A-G-E-998
    918 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
esis, or the doctrine of opposites (mind and nature, light and darkness, sweet and 
sour, good and bad, etc.), belongs to the elementary stage of reflection. It is, 
however, a necessary stage of thought (although no uitimate one) and far above 
the activity of sense perception. But, compared with the thinking activity of the 
comprehending reason, it is still very crude. Moreover, from the fact that it is 
not guided by a principle above reflection, it is very uncertain. It is liable to fall 
from the stage of reflection which cognizes antithesis (essential relation) to that 
which cognizes mere difference (nonessential relation). Such imperfection I con- 
ceive to belong rather to some of the interpreters of Froebel’s philosophic views 
than to Froebel’s system as he understood it. It is certainly not a fault of his 
pedagogies. His philosophy is far deeper than that of Pestalozzi, while his peda- 
gogical system is far more consistent, both in theory and in practice. 
As regards the claimed transcendence of the system over all others in the way 
of moral development, I am inclined to grant some degree of superiority to it, but 
not for intrinsic reasons. It is because the child is then at an age when he is liable 
to great demoralization at home and is submitted to a gentle but firm discipline 
in the kindergarten that the new education proves of more than ordinary value 
as amoral discipline. The children of the poor, at the susceptible age of 5 years, 
get many lessons on the street that tend to corrupt them. The children of the 
rich, meeting no wholesome restraint, become self-willed and self-indulgent. The 
kindergarten may save both classes and make rational self-control take the place 
of unrestrained, depraved impulse. 
But the kindergarten itself has dangers. The cultivation of self-activity may 
be excessive and lead to pertness and conceit. The pupil may get to be irreverent 
and overbearing—hardened against receiving instruction from others. In fact, 
with a teacher whose discernment is dimmed by too much sentimental theory, 
there is great danger that the weeds of selfishness will thrive faster among the 
children than the wholesome plants of self-knowledge and self-control. The 
apotheosis of childhood and infancy is a very dangerous idea to put in practice. 
It does well enough in Wordsworth’s great ode, as a sequence of the doctrine of 
preexistence; and it is quite necessary that we should, as educators, never forget 
that the humblest child—nay, the most depraved child—has within him the possi- 
bility of the highest angelic being. But this angelic nature is only implicit, and 
not explicit, in the child or in the savage or in the uneducated. To use the lan- 
guage of Aristotle, the undeveloped human being is a “first entelechy,” while the 
developed, cultured man is a ‘‘second entelechy.” Both aro, ‘‘ by nature,” rational 
beings; but only the educated, moral, and religious man is rational actually. ‘By 
nature” signifies ‘‘ potentially ” or ‘containing the possibility of.’ 
There is no technical expression in the history of pedagogy with which more 
juggling has been done than with the word ‘‘nature.” As used by most writers, 
it signifies the ideal or normal type of the growth of anything. The nature of 
the oak realizes itself in the acorn-bearing monarch of the forest. The nature of 
man is realized in the angelic, godlike being whose intellect, and will, and emo- 
tions are rational, moral, and pervaded by love. We hear the end of education 
spoken of as the harmonious development of human nature, physical, intellectual, 
moral, and affectional. This ‘‘nature,” in the sense of ideal or normal type, is, 
however, liable to be confounded with ‘‘nature” in the opposite sense, viz, nature 
as the external world (of unconscious growth). This confusion is the worst that 
could happen, when we are dealing with the problem of human life; for man, by 
nature (as unconscious growth), is only the infant or savage, the mere animal, 
and his possible angelic ‘‘nature” is only possible. Moreover, this possibility 
never will become actuality except through his own self-activity; he must make 
himself rational, for nature as the external world will never do this for him, 
Indeed, where nature as the external (unconscious) world is most active in its 
processes—say, in the torrid zone—there the development of man will be most   
-P-A-G-E-999
  HISTORY OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN ST. LOUIS. 919 
retarded. Nature as external world is a world of dependence, each thing being 
conditioned by everything else, and hence under fate. The humblest clod on the 
earth pulsates with vibrations that have traveled hither from the farthest star. 
Each piece of matter is necessitated to be what it is by the totality of conditions. 
But the nature of man—human nature—must be freedom, and not fate. It must 
be self-determined, and not a mere “ thing” which is made to be what it is by the 
constraining activity of the totality of conditions. Hence, those who confuse 
these two meanings of ‘‘nature” juggle with the term, and in one place mean the 
rational ideal of man—the self determining mind—and in another place they mean 
a thing, as the product of nature as external world. The result of this juggling 
is the old pedagogical contradiction found in Rousseau throughout, and now and 
then in the systems of all other pedagogical reformers—Pestalozzi in particular, 
and even in Locke before Rousseau. 
To become rational, man must learn to practice self-control and to substitute - 
moral purpose for mere impulse. Man inherits from nature, in time and space, 
impulses and desires; and, as subject to them, he is only a Prometheus Vinctus— 
a slave of appetite and passion, like all other animals. The infant begins his 
existence with a maximum of unconscious impulse and a minimum of conscious, 
tational, moral purpose. The disciple of Froebel who apotheosizes infancy and 
says, with Wordsworth: 
Heaven lies about us in our infancy, 
and who thinks that the child is a— 
Mighty prophet! Seer blest, 
On whom those truths do rest 
Which we are toiling all our lives to find, 
is prone to regard the kindergarten as a ‘‘child’s paradise,” wherein he should be 
allowed to develop unrestrainedly, and the principle, laissez faire—‘‘let him 
alone’”’—is to fill the world with angels. 
This belief in the perfection of nature is the archheresy of education. It is the 
more dangerous because it has a side of deepest truth—the truth which makes 
education possible, viz, the truth that man possesses the capacity for self-regener- 
ation—the capacity of putting off his natural impulses and desires, his animal 
selfishness, and of putting on righteousness and holiness. His ideal nature must 
be made real by himself in order to be. His real nature, as a product of time and 
space, must be annulled and subordinated, and hisideal nature be made real in its 
place. 
The child as individual, and without availing himself of the help of his fellows, 
is a mere slave, a thing, a being controlled by fate. Through participation with 
his fellow-men united into institutions—those infinite, rational organisms, the 
product of the intellect and will of the race conspiring through the ages of human 
history and inspired by the Divine purpose which rules all as Providence—through 
participation in institutions, man is enabled to attain freedom, to complement his 
defects as individual by the deeds of the race; he subdues nature in time and 
space and makes it his servant; he collects the shreds of experience from the 
individuals of the race and combines them into wisdom, and preserves and trans- 
mits the same from generation to generation; he invents the instrumentalities of 
intercommunication—the alphabet, the art of printing, the telegraph and railroad, 
the scientific society, the publishing house, the bookstore, the library, the school, 
and, greater than all, the newspaper. The poor, squalid individual, an insignifi- 
cant atom in space and time, can, by the aid of these great institutions, lift him- 
self up to culture, and to the infinitude of endless development. From being 
mere individual, he can become generic, i.e., realize in himself the rationality of 
the entire species of the human race. By education we mean to do exactly this 
thing; to give to the individual the means of this participation in the aggregate 
labors of all humanity.
-P-A-G-E-1000
  920 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Hence we are bound to consider education practically, as a process of initiating 
the particular individual into the life of his race as intellect and will power. We 
must give to a child the means to help himself and the habit and custom of help- 
ing himself; to participate in the labors of his fellow-men, and to become a con- 
tributor to the store created by mankind. Institutions: the family; civil society, 
with its arts and trades and professions and establishments, schools, etc.; the 
state, with its more comprehensive organizations, and, finally, thechurch. These 
are greater than the individual, and they are products of his ideal nature, and 
exist solely as means whereby the individual may develop his ideal. 
The kindergarten, then, has the same general object that the school has had all 
along —to eliminate the merely animal from the child, and to develop in its place 
the rational and spiritual life. 
Now, as regards the science of the kindergarten, there is one more consideration 
. which is too important to pass by—the theory of play as an educational element. 
The school had been too much impressed with the main fact of its mission, viz., 
to eliminate the animal nature and to superinduce the spiritual nature, to notice 
the educative function of play. Froebel was the first to fully appreciate this and 
to devise a proper series of disciplines for the youngest children. The old régime 
of the school did not pay respect enough to the principle of self-activity. It sacri- 
ficed spontaneity in an utterly unnecessary manner, instead of developing it into 
rational self-determination. Hence it produced human machines, governed by 
prescription and conventionality, and but few enlightened spontaneous personali- 
ties who possessed insight as well as law-abiding habit. Such human machines, 
governed by prescription, would develop into lawbreakers or sinners the moment 
that the pressure of social laws was removed from them. They did not possess 
enough individuality of their own. They had not assimilated what they had been 
compelled to practice. They were not competent to readjust themselves to a 
change of surroundings. 
Now, in play the child realizes for himself his spontaneity, but in its irrational 
form of arbitrariness and caprice. In its positive phase he produces whatever his 
fancy dictates; in its negative phase he destroys again what he has made, or what- 
ever ishis own. He realizes by these operations the depth of originality which 
his will power involves—the power to create and the power to destroy. This will 
power is the root of his personality—the source of his freedom. Deprive a child 
of his play, and you produce arrested development in his character. Nor can his 
play’ be rationalized by the kindergarten so as to dispense altogether with the 
utterly spontaneous, untamed play of the child, wherein he gives full scope to his 
fancy and caprice, without depriving his play of its essential character and 
changing it from play into work. Even inthe kindergarten, just as in the school, 
there must be prescription. But the good kindergarten wisely and gently con- 
trols in such manner as to leave room for much of the pure spontaneity of play. 
It prescribes tasks, but preserves the form of play as much as is possible. If the 
child were held to a rigid accountability in the kindergarten for the performance 
of his task, it would then cease to be play and become labor. Labor performs the 
prescribed task. Play prescribes for itself. The attempt to preserve the form of 
self-prescription for the child in his tasks is what saves the kindergarten from 
being a positive injury to the child at this tender and immature age. It is the 
preservation of the form of play, and at the same time the induction of the sub- 
stance of prescription, that constitutes what is new and valuable in Froebel’s 
method of instruction. There is a gentle insinuation of habits of attention, of 
self-control, of action in concert, of considerateness toward others, of desire to par- 
ticipate in the common result of the school, that succeeds in accomplishing this 
necessary change of heart in the child—from selfishness to self-renunciation— 
without sacrificing his spontaneity so much as is done in the old-fashioned primary 
school, And he gets large measures of the benefits of the school that he would

have lost had he remained at home in the family. The child, too, at this period of 
life has begun to experience a hunger for the more substantial things of social 
life, and the family alone can not satisfy his longings. The discovery of Froebel 
gives the child what is needed of the substantial effects of the school without the 
danger of roughly crushing out his individuality at the same time. 
THE PRACTICAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE KINDERGARTEN. 
After we have decided in the affirmative the essential questions relative to the 
reasonavleness of the course of study and discipline of the kindergarten, its suita- 
bility to the age of the children, its effect upon the education that follows it, we 
come to the subsidiary questions regarding expense, training of teachers, and the 
details of management. These questions are not important, unless the decision is 
reached that the kindergarten theory is substantially correct. If it is found to be 
avaluable adjunct to the school, then we must solve the practical problems of 
how to introduce it into the public-school system. The problem is, how to meet 
the expense. If the traditional form of the kindergarten be adopted, that of one 
teacher to each dozen pupils, and this constituting an isolated kindergarten, the 
annual cost of tuition would be from $50 to $100 per pupil, a sum too extravagant 
to be paid by any public-school system. The average tuition per pupil in public- 
school systems of the United States ranges from $12 to $20 for the year’s schooling 
of two hundred days. No school board would be justified in expending five times 
as much per pupil for tuition in a kindergarten as it expended for the tuition of a 
pupil in the primary or grammar school. 
If it is necessary to limit the number of pupils per teacher to 12 or 20, while in 
the primary school each teacher can manage and properly instruct 50 or 70, it 
becomes likewise necessary to invent a system of cheaper teachers. At once the 
Lancasterian system, or the ‘‘monitorial” system, suggests itself as a model for 
the organization of the cheap kindergarten. The kindergarten shall be a large one, 
located in a room of ample size to hold 5 to 10 tables, each table to have 15 chil- 
dren attending it, and presided over by a novitiate teacher; and the whole room 
shall be placed under the charge of a thoroughly competent teacher of experience 
and skill and well versed in the theory and practice of Froebel’s system. The 
director of the kindergarten must be a well-paid teacher, receiving as much as the 
principal of a primary school, with 2 assistants. Her assistants. the “‘ novitiate 
teachers,” are learners of the system. The first year they shall be volunteers, and 
receive no salary; the second year, or as soon as they pass the first examination in 
theory and practice of the kindergarten, they are to receive a small salary as ‘‘ paid 
assistants.” After a year’s service as paid assistants they may pass a second exami- 
nation, and, if found competent, be appointed directors, and receive a higher 
salary. 
In the St. Louis kindergartens the number of 60 pupils entitles the director to 1 
paid assistant, and there is 1 additional appointed for each 30 pupils above that 
number, Thus there would be a director and 4 paid assistants if the kindergar- 
ten had 150 pupils. (The director would, in St. Louis, receive $350 per annum, 
and each paid assistant $125 per annum. The cost of tuition, based on teachers’ 
salaries, would be $850 per annum for the 150 pupils, being less than $6 per annum 
for each.) 
Besides the salaried teachers of the kindergarten, it is expected that there will 
be an equal or greater number of volunteers. In order to make it worth while for 
volunteers to join the system, as well as to secure the development of the salaried 
teachers, it is necessary to have two persons of superior ability that can give 
instruction once a week on the theory and practice (the ‘‘ gifts and occupations”) 
of. Froebel’s system. A young woman will find so much culture of thought to be 
derived from the discussion of Froebel’s insights and theories, and so much pecul-  
-P-A-G-E-1002
    922 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
iarly fitting experience from her daily class in the kindergarten—experience that 
will prove invaluable to her as a wifeand mother—that she will serve her appren- 
ticeship in the kindergarten gladly, though it be no part of her intention to follow 
teaching as a vocation. 
It is a part of the system, as an adjunct to the public schools, to educate young 
women in these valuable matters relating to the early training of children. I 
have thought that the benefit derived by the 200 young women of the St. Louis 
Kindergartens from the lectures of Miss Blow to be of sufficient value to compen- 
sate the city for the cost of the kindergartens. A nobler and more enlightened 
womanhood will result, and the family will prove a better nurture for the child. 
Here we come upon the most important practical difficulty in the way of the 
general introduction of the kindergarten. If the teachers are no better than the 
average mothers in our families, if they are not better than the average primary 
teacher, it is evident that the system of Froebel can not effect any great reform in 
society. ‘‘It is useless to expect social regeneration from persons who are not 
themselves regenerated.” 
In our St. Louis work we have been very fortunate in having a lady of great 
practical sagacity, of profound and clear insight, and of untiring energy to organ- 
ize our kindergartens and instruct our teachers. Her (Miss Susan E. Blow’s) dis- 
interested and gratuitous services have been the means of securing for us a system 
that now furnishes its own directors, assistants, and supervisors. 
There is another important point connected with the economy of the kindergar- 
ten. The session should not last over three hours for the children of this age. 
Hence each room permits two different sessions to be held in it per day, one in the 
morning and one in the afternoon, thus accommodating double the number of 
pupils. In some cases, where the teacher has attained experience and strength 
sufficient, she teaches in both sessions, and receives a higher grade of salary for 
the work. (In St. Louis, as already mentioned, directors receive $600 for two 
sessions per day, and $350 for one session; paid assistants receive $125 for one ses- 
sion and $200 per annum for two daily sessions. ) 
The furniture of the kindergarten is made up of small, movable chairs and small 
tables, each one capable of accommodating two children—the surface of the table 
being marked off into divisions 1 inch square. It is better to use the small tables 
than large ones that will accommodate a whole class, for the small ones may be 
moved easily and combined into large ones of any desirable size, and may be 
readily arranged into any shape or figure, and placed in any part of the room, by 
the children themselves. It is necessary to use the floor of the room during one 
exercise each day for the games, at which time all the children are collected ‘‘on 
the circle;” at this time it may be desirable to remove the tables to the sides of 
the room, and with small tables this can be easily accomplished. Again, in the 
absence of one of the teachers, it may become necessary to combine two classes 
into one, uniting two tables. The small tables are, therefore, an important item 
in the economy of the kindergarten. 
With these suggestions, I leave the subject, believing that they are sufficient to 
justify the directors of our public schools in making the kindergarten a part of 
our school system. The advantage to the community in utilizing the age from 4 
to 6; in training the hand and eye; in developing habits of cleanliness, politeness, 
self-control, urbanity, industry; in training the mind to understand numbers and 
geometric forms, to invent combinations of figures and shapes, and to represent 
them with the pencil—these and other valuable lessons in combination with their 
fellow-pupils and obedience to the rule of their superiors—above all, the useful 
suggestions as to methods of instruction which will come from the kindergarten 
and penetrate the methods of the other schools—will, I think, ultimately prevail 
in securing to us the establishment of this beneficent institution in all the city 
school systems of our country.

college. The title of the report is Agricultural Schools: Their Objects, Methods, 
and Equipments. In the course of his argument the reporter remarked that 
“agricultural colleges have for their aim the promotion of intelligence in farm- 
ing” and of ‘‘such discipline of body, mind, and sympathies as shall give strength 
for the task of elevating agriculture while the everyday surroundings add to the 
natural curiosity about seeds, soils, moisture, heat, germination, and fertilization, 
variation in plant and animal, adaptation of parts and forces. Botany, chemistry, 
mineralogy, entomology, comparative anatomy, physiology, zoology, and geology 
make a series so full of constant adaptations to previous curiosity as to give new 
zest to the problems of farm life.” 
Upon the conclusion of the report one of the members of the Council inquired 
whether the agricultural schools had investigated certain questions in agricultural 
chemistry which he deemed to be of great practical importance and to which he had 
seen no satisfactory answers. One of these yuestions was, ‘‘ Does the deprivation 
of light have an effect to cause air to deposit some of its nitrogen?” He also wanted 
an explanation of the reason why untilled land produced a sparse vegetation, while 
the earth overturned and frequently stirred was far more fruitful, He thought 
(speaking in 1888) that there should be far more experimenting among farmers 
and in agricultural colleges, and he also thought that when youth were properly 
instructed in agricultural schools they would be able to show the fallacies of the 
one-tax theory. In reply to the inquiry, the reporter, President Fairchild, 
remarked that his college had been conducting experiments for two years upon 
the source of nitrogen, and when the experiments were completed a report thereon 
would be made, as the problem is a very complex one from the many modifying 
circumstances. 
This report to thenational council in 1888 was upon education in agriculture, and 
in such a report it would have been out of place to have spoken of the other group 
of technical subjects which Congress had joined with agricultural, that is to say, 
the engineering professions, when that body founded the schools for the benefit 
of agriculture and the mechanic arts. But in treating of such double-purposed 
colleges it would be somewhat anomalous for this Bureau to speak of them as 
though they were wholly agricultural colleges. As poorly as the study of agri- 
culture had flourished in the land-grant colleges up to 1890, it was in a better posi- 
tion than the study of mining and metallurgical engineering. ‘‘We Germans,” 
said a professor of that nationality, “have a large export trade in chemists.” Thus 
a country filled with natural resources and home and foreign capital to develop 
them had no institution that could compare in status with the Royal Mining 
Academy of a little German State no bigger than the half of Massachusetts. 
Part I—BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTIONS. 
Agriculture is both a science and an art, and the knowledge of all the conditions 
of vegetable life forms its scientific basis. If, then,it be asked, Whatis the reason 
one kind of plant succeeds in a field where another fails? the question belongs to 
the science of agriculture; but if it be asked, What measures are to be taken to 
preserve the fertility of a field or to render it fertile? that is a question put by the 
art to the science.' 
The confusing federation of isolated sciences which form the course in agricul- 
ture in American colleges interferes with the study of that science. It is impos- 
sible to deny that the study lacks unity.. There is a department of practice or 
labor, of chemistry, of physics, of botany, and the other classificatory sciences in 
every agricultural school. This separation is, indeed, unavoidable, but the work 
of these departments appears to be unfocused.

  AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 925 
In the following matter it will be confidently assumed that the advance in 
piological study has cleared the way for a conception of a course in the theory 
of agriculture that is more homogeneous than the mere parallelism of a number of 
abstract sciences, the application of which to agriculture is recognized, but not 
shown. In thus recalling and in collating certain facts in regard to the science 
of agriculture, it will be considered, for the sake of brevity and clearness, to be— 
1. The theories about the chemical changes whereby manure is changed into 
food (‘‘ fertility”). 
2. The circumstances that produce fertility. 
3. The self-activity of plants in availing themselves to the utmost of the possi- 
bilities of their surroundings in order to perfect the hereditary instincts produced. 
by the natural or artificial impregnation of the flower whence comes the seed. 
In pursuing the course thus marked out the conceptions by which chemists and. 
botanists have represented to themselves and to the public the manner in which 
plants grow and how they feed will be spoken of, then the effect on the soil of a 
long continuous growing and feeding of agricultural plants, and finally the man- 
ner in which plants behave as individuals endowed with the energy of sustaining 
themselves and perpetuating their kind and how new kinds of plants are created. 
But before speaking of a century of inconclusive but epoch-making hypotheses 
about vegetable nutrition, a half a century of facts which are true of Rothamsted 
at least, and a quarter of a century of the study of natural selection and the vari- 
ation of plants under domestication, we must speak of two experimenters to 
whose sagacity the idea of an agricultural chemistry built on facts, the inspi- 
ration to found a Rothamsted, and the idea of a natural selection are due. 
In 1804 M. Theodore de Saussure published the first and most important body 
of original and indisputable facts concerning agricultural chemistry ever issued. 
It bore the title ‘‘ Recherches chimiques sur la végétation,” and as it isnot a work 
of the imagination, it may be described for those who like a lively diction and the 
brilliant effects found in Mr. Jules Verne’s Trip to the Moon as a very dull book 
indeed. M. de Saussure did not wish to amuse. He desired to avoid all questions 
to which experiment could give no answer, for ‘‘in natural history facts alone 
lead to the truth,” and though he candidly acknowledges that the road he has 
chosen is dry and tiresome, he justifies his course on the ground that it alone will 
lead to the development of agriculture.! 
About 1860 Mr. Darwin began publishing his investigations in vegetable forces, 
and in doing so apologizes for his intrusion into the field of botany. ‘‘The hybrid- 
ization and movement of plants, he says, ought to have been treated by a professed 
botanist”;® but it was necessary that the author of the Descent of Man should seek 
instances in the vegetable kingdom to verify his hypothesis—the so-called Dar- 
winian hypothesis—of natural selection.? These investigations of Mr. Darwin are 
epoch making, but seem not yet to be classed as a part of agricultural science. 
The future may show that to ascertain the difference between the vigor of a weed. 
and of a ‘‘useful plant” is a very important thing for agricultural science to do. 
THE CONVERSION OF GASES AND EARTHS INTO FOOD. 
Before the dawn of the century now drawing to aclose, Bonnet,‘ of Geneva, had 
discovered that the leaves of plants give off a gas; Priestley, an Englishman, the 
discoverer of oxygen, that the gas is oxygen;’ Ingenhouse, an Anglicized Hol-

lander, that light causes the gas to flow out,! and Senebier, *again a Genevese, 
that the gas discarded is a waste product which the leaf, so to speak, pulls out 
from the chemical compound which enters it as carbonic-acid gas. Thus the 
basis for a chemistry of agriculture was laid, and upon this foundation Saussure, 
another citizen of Geneva, began to build the science of agriculture. 
Mr. de Saussure’s problem was this: Is Bonnet right in claiming that plants are 
fed entirely by air and water? Do they really make the chemicals contained in 
their structure or are they fed entirely by matter in the shape of gas?+ He sought 
the answer in the ashes of plants, and he was ‘‘astonished to find that three-fourths 
of the ashes of green herbaceous plants are alkaline salts.”> My life, he says in 
substance, was not long enough to investigate this matter thoroughly by studying 
the ashes of different plants and different parts of the same plant at different 
periods of a plant’s existence. But even this regret bore fruit, for it inspired Sir 
John Lawes to undertake the work of long breath now so famous as the 
“Rothamsted Experiments,” ® while the experiments he did make have given rise 
to the theories or quasi theories of Boussingault, who stood out for the overwhelm- 
ing value of the nitrogenous (ammoniacal) matiers of manure; of Liebig, who 
stood out for the value of the mineral matter it should contain, the air furnishing 
ammonia,’ and of Pasteur, who stood out for microbous ferments, which, in their 
action, perhaps robbed the air of its nitrogen and turned it over to the plant chem- 
ically as Liebig* contended; perhaps broke up the insoluble compounds of nitrogen 
which Liebig showed were in the soil as the leaf takes out carbon from the carbonic 
acid of the air; perhaps merely converted the farmyard manure into ‘‘ammonia 
salts,” as Boussingault, without dreaming of a microbe, thought® in one way and 
Saussure in another.” : 
In view of these statements it may be suggested that the starting point in the 
science of agriculture is the work of M. de Saussure, entitled Recherches chimiques 
sur la végétation, and that their author is the father of agricultural science.'' It

8 The investigations with which I have busied myself in this work (Recherches chimique sur 
la végétation) haye for their object the influence of water, air, and humus upon the vegetation 
(pi). My end was to learn (by examining the ashes of burned plants) the law of their structure, 
not only by examining the ashes of different plants, but of the different parts of the same plant 
and at different periods of its growth. My life was too short to thoroughly carry out sucha 
work and I deemed it sufficient to follow general investigations (p. 312).

amount of nutriment furnished by the air.

M. Boussingault, in Revue Scientifique, July 9, 1887). Likewise Professor Pettinkoffer, of the 
University of Munich, claims the same distinction for his friend and colleague, Baron Liebig. 
Tt seems natural, to say the least, to place Saussure as the founder of agricultural chemistry 
and of the proper method of investigation, while to the genius of Liebig may be given the honor 
of throwing the facts into a pedagogic form. Such ideas can in no way interfere with the 
vast merit of M. Boussingault in his researches on nitrogen as announced by the great chemist 
himself in telling M. Dehérain that when he began “no one knew how much azote (nitrogen) is 
in hay.” Saussure’s problem was to find how much air stuff there is in hay, and Liebig’s to tell 
how it got there.

was he who first used the direct method in the chemical observation of plant 
growth, though Boussingault claims for himself the honor of applying with profit 
the indirect method of procedure which is called by the ambiguous name of ele- 
mentary analysis (analyse élémentaire).! 
As there will be frequent mention here of experimentation, let us ask, What is 
an experiment? ‘When I consider,” says Sir Humphry Davy, ‘‘the variety of 
theories which may be formed on the slender foundation of one or two facts, I 
am convinced thatit is the business of the true philosopher to avoid them [theories] 
altogether; it is more laborious to accumulate facts than to reason concerning 
them, but one good experiment is of more value than the ingenuity of a brain like 
Newton’s.” Despite this slashing argument it is to be observed that it may require 
a brain like Newton’s to tell what an experiment is worth after it has been made, 
and it may not be too delicate a point to raise to ask whether it is ignorance or 
a theory which starts an experiment; and if it be ignorance, how can the experi- 
ment be intelligent, and if it be theory, how can the experiment—whether positive 
or negative, and however well done—be intellectually better than its source? In 
the course of this paper an attempt will be made to answer this question. At 
present the value of a single experiment may be ascertained from the following 
relation: 
About the close of the last century one Lampadius made the following test: He 
constructed of boards five adjacent compartments or boxes, each box being 2 feet 
square and 1 foot deep. In one of these he put clay, into another sand, iato 
another magnesia soil, into another lime soil, and into the remaining one garden 
soil, having, it should be added, previously mixed 8 pounds of cow manure with 
the material placed in each box. Upon these five soils he sowed rye, and in due 
course of time and of the necessary incinerations of the harvest he found that the 
ashes yielded by the plant products of each box of soil were made up of the 
same kind of substance. He forthwith concluded that these substances had been 
formed without any reference to the nature of the soil, but he forgot to note the 
possible effect that 8 pounds of the same substance he had mixed with the earth 
contained in each box might have upon his conclusion. It must be remembered 
that it was only a few years before that Lavosier had triumphantly disproved the 
idea of the savants of the eighteenth century that water makes soil.” 
We can form three hypotheses about the source of plant food. It may be con- 
jectured that it is manufactured by the plant itself, or that it is merely appropri- 
ated by the plant ready-made, either from the air by its leaves or from the earth 
through its roots. Of these let us begin with the atmosphere which is the sphere 
of the leaf. The following description will give some conception of this organ: 
The apparatus of the leaf: Examined under the microscope with very high powers the leaf 
of a tea plant presents the following characteristics: The upper skin (fig. 5) is formed of polyg- 
enal cells, with their cell walls or cases slightly undulating. The skin on its outer surface, 
next the air, is comparatively thick and smooth. The lower (fig. 4) is formed of cells a little 
more irregular, and is furnished with mouthlike openings, which are called stomata (meaning 
in the Greek language a mouth—stoma), and hairs, better shown in the crosscut (fig. 2) of a 
melon leaf. These stomata present a very characteristic appearance, which is peculiar to the 
Camellia family. They are surrounded generally by three cells, which are smaller than the 
others and are flattened. The hairs consist of a single cell shaped like a cone; are generaily 
curved, and have very thick walls. A hair cell is shown in fig. 4, where it is represented as flat 
upon the leaf; in fig. 2 it is represented standing up. Fig.1 is the crosscut of the midrib of 
a tea leat. Fig. 8 is a stoma of Sedum lipurium. (Illustrations compiled from Articles on

The leaf has three exterior exchanges with the atmosphere—one is to discharge 
water vapor into the air; another to disconnect the carbon of the carbonic acid

gas acid go, and the third is, in common with all parts of the plant, to respire—to 
breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbonic acid gas day and night during its. 
entire life. In the light this ‘‘ transpiration,” “assimilation,” and ‘‘respiration” 
all go on together. While leaves, stem, and roots are throwing off carbonic acid 
(as all living things must, and as the skin and lungs relieve the human frame of 
the waste products of the nervous system), the vital energy of the leaves is expend- 
ing itself in breaking up in its leaves that very carbonic acid in order to carbonize 
the juices of the plant, just as the lungs inhale oxygen to burn up the products of 
that carbonization when they have been introduced into the stomach as food. 
Conservation of energy of this description excited the astonishment of the British 
Royal Society over one hundred years ago! and was beautifully pictured by Dumas 
and Boussingault® long before the discovery of the physical conception of that 
fact at Berlin and Manchester. 
It would be absurd to contend that the water and carbonic acid breathed out by 
the plant nourishes that plant, and it seems to follow that the feeding (if such it 
is) done by the plant through its foliage is confined to the extraction of the carbon 
suspended in the atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid gas. The simplest 
experiment imaginable led to this discovery. Finding that confined air was not 
spoiled by the growth of a mint plant kept in it for some months, Dr. Priestley 
thought it possible that the process of vegetation might restore the air injured by 
the fumes from a burning candle. Accordingly on the 17th of August, 1771, he 
put a plant of mint into air in which a wax candle had burned until it had been 
entirely consumed, and on the 27th of the same month he found that the oxygen 
had been restored to the vitiated air, for another candle burned perfectly well in 
the receptacle in which the air used in the experiment was confined.’ 
But this kind of experiment does not tell all. There yet remains the quanti- 
tative proof of the fact. This Saussure gave. Let seven plants of vinca or peri- 
winkle be kept for six days in 2,262 cubic inches of confined atmosphere, of which 
7.5 per cent is carbonic acid gas, mixed up with 92.5 parts of common air; then 
on the seventh day it will be found that 169.6 cubic inchés of carbonic acid gas 
have disappeared and 114.7 cubic inches of oxygen have taken its place. Fifty 
years afterwards such an experiment in the hands of Boussingault would have 
resulted in giving a volume of oxygen practically equal to that of the dissipated 
carbonic acid.’ It is quite safe, then, to say that the leaf eats (so to speak) of 
carbon, and that indirectly it takes this from the air, though it must never be 
forgotten that the capital function of the leaf is, to use an expression necessitated 
by our ignorance, ‘‘to elaborate” the sap. Why the leaf should act thus through 
a green substance it contains called chlorophyll has engaged the attention of 
many, but there is something about the question that stunts the growth of an 
hypothesis. 
If the carbon that is required by vegetation is obtained from the atmosphere, 
which contains only three parts of carbonic acid in every 10,000 parts of common 
air, it might be supposed that nitrogen, which forms 8,000 parts of every 10,000 
of the air, would also be obtained in the same way. But nature in feeding vege- 
tation prefers to decompose compounds, and during this century, at least, it has 
become more and more the ambition of agricultural chemists to discover the source 
of nitrogen obtained by the plant. Not that nitrogen is more important than 
free oxygen or water in vegetable nutrition, but because it was recognized that it

is the very essential ingredient of fertility that man must supply. In the valley. 
of the Nile nature unaided annually performs a great irrigating and fertilizing 
feat,! but in countries where human labor and foresight have to overcome natural 
deficiencies farm-yard manure or, in general, the waste products of life were 
long thought to be alone capable of supplying the missing ingredient. Even now 
in China, the most fertile country, it is said, imaginable, after centuries of culti- 
vation the people still continue to use this simple, antiquated method of preserv- 
ing the fertility of their soil. -—Europe is more advanced, and were text-books of 
agriculture and papers read before learned societies to be consulted as a guide it 
would appear that the farmer who asserts the preeminent value of farm-yard 
manure is worthy of the reply made by one of Moliére’s physicians to a patient 
who contended that the heart was on the left side of the human body, ‘‘ Oh, we 
have changed all that now.” Manure, said Liebig, is extremely useful to the 
plant when it has no leaves, since it furnishes to the roots the carbonic acid 
required in starting the new growthin spring, but as for its being the main source

of nitrogen, that is not so, for the plant obtains that gas from the ammonia of the 
air which is washed into the soil by the rains,? To this M. Boussingault* imper- 
sonally replied that the experience of all farmers is of far more value than the 
opinion of one scientist. 
Theory and practice and the doctors thus disagreeing, it may be well to inquire, 
** What is a root?” or rather ‘‘ What is the function of a root?” 
What the mixture of gases called the atmosphere is to the leaf, that and more 
is water to the roots. _We are not more surprised to learn that the air we breathe 
can be solidified than to learn that by irrigation a desert may be made fertile. It 
is true that some forms of vegetation, such as mosses and mushrooms, have no 
roots, but the conditions of their growth recalls a charming fancy of Voigt, 
wherein he claims that vegetable mold is not wholly dead matter, but is a vast

pervading, unorganized plant which bears and nourishes other plants as a tree 
affords nutrition to all its branches and shoots.! 
The root is then an apparatus to absorb water. It is composed of three parts, 
acap or penetrating point, a muff of fine hairs which follows close behind the 
cap, and finally an arm or the body proper of the root, which is at once an anchor, 
an alimentary canal, and a pump. For the direct purpose of plant nourishment 
the most important of these parts of the root is the muff of absorbing hairs. It is 
this structure that takes up nutriment suspended in the moisture of the soil, as is 
shown by the following illustrated statements: 
  
  
  1. Both root cap and muff submerged in fertile 
liquid. 2. Root cap alone submerged. 38. Neither 
cap nor muff submerged. 4. Muff alone sub-

tion of root: 7, root; p, dies. “It is well to cover surface of liquid with 
muff; c, cap. oil in meking this experiment.” 
The following are Saussure’s rules regarding absorption of solid substances by 
the roots:* 
1. The roots of plants take up alkali salts and humus extract in a smaller proportion than 
they are held by the water in which they are dissolved. 
2. The pruning of the roots, their decay, and, in general, the pining away of the plant favor 
the absorption of salts and humus extract. 
3. A plant does not take in in equal proportion all the dissolved substances held by the water surrounding its roots. In general, it takes in least of those substances which are the most viscid. 
4, If the weight of the extracts which the most fertile soil affords be compared with the 
weight of the dry plant which has grown upon it, it will be found that the plant’ has obtained 
only a small part of its weight from that soil. 
Such is the root, the apparatus which is supposed to obtain the nitrogen required 
by the plant; but though the best established facts in agriculture had long before 
concurred in showing that nitrogen is fixed by growing plants, it was not until 1838 
that an attack in the Saussurean manner was made upon the problem by Mr. 
Boussingault, a traveler, a chemist, and afarmer. ‘‘Had I chosen the old line of 
investigation,” said this experimenter, ‘‘ I would have failed; so I sought an answer 
by aid of an elemental analysis of the seed sown and the crop of seeds a similar 
seed produced from water and air.”? The results thus obtained are fundamental, 
and are summarized by the investigator in this language: 
1. Clover and peas grown in a soil absolutely without manure acquire a very

appreciable quantity of nitrogen in addition to a large quantity of carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen. 
2, Wheat and oats grown under precisely the same circumstances took carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen from the air and water around them, but no nitrogen.! 
As it is known that plants absorb water—that is to say, oxygen and hydrogen— 
and it has been shown how they absorb carbon from the carbonic acid of the air, 
the question arises, where did the peas and clover of those experiments get the nitro- 
gen that was beyond the power of the wheat and oats to procure? Do leguminous 
plants make their own nitrogen? Probably Mr. Boussingault would have con- 
sidered the last question too trivial for an answer. At all events, he neither 
asked the question nor attempted to explain whence came the nitrogen produced 
in his remarkable tests. Upon that point, in 1838 at least, he ‘‘could only offer 
conjectures,” and yet would not.’ 
Nevertheless, a genius of a more didactic than an experimental cast, and one 
haying no doubts about anything in his specialty, did not hesitate to explain the 
phenomenon, ‘The first and most important question to be solved,” said Pro- 
fessor Liebig, ‘‘is how and in what form does nature furnish nitrogen to vege- 
table albumen, and gluten to fruits and seeds. This question,” he says, ‘‘is sus- 
ceptible of a very simple solution.” His solution was this: There is not the 
slightest reason for believing that the leaves or the roots of plants take in nitro- 
gen directly from the atmosphere for the purpose of feeding the plant, but there 
are numerous facts showing that the roots of plants do take up a compound of 
nitrogen called ammonia given off into the air by the putrefaction of animal 
matter and thence washed down into the soil by the rains.’ 
It must be confessed that the hypothesis was built upon strong grounds of 
probability. From Saussure down it had been known that there is a trace of 
ammonia in the air,‘ and the ease with which water absorbs the gas (well known 
as the ‘‘ammonia” of the shops), the acknowledged power of the plant to break 
up both carbonic acid and water into carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and the 
excess of hydrogen which is found in the plant,’ all seem to supply every evi- 
dence required by conjecture to enable it to resolutely affirm that ammonia gas 
from the atmosphere is the source of vegetable nitrogen. But while Liebig was 
declaiming on the theme that humus is merely ‘‘a slow and constant source of 
carbonic acid to the roots,” and that to spread manure upon the fields, which 
already contain more nitrogen than the manure spread upon them contains, for 
the purpose of adding nitrogen to those fields, is folly, Boussingault was assert- 
ing that ‘“‘ whatever may be the constitution and physical properties of land, it 
yields lucrative crops only in proportion as it contains an adequate quantity of 
organic matter, in a more or less advanced state of decomposition, called humus, 
or what is nearly the same thing—vegetable earth or mold.1. Having thus 
apparently flatly contradicted Baron Liebig, he goes on to say that no working 
of the field, nor favoritism of climate, nor salts or alkalis will take the place of 
1It is impossible here and perhaps unnecessary to follow up Boussingault’s work in attempting 
tosolve the nitrogen problem. In a positive way he never got further than his 1838 declaration. 
2My mode of experimenting had in view merely to determine the assimilation of nitrogen by 
certain vegetables without entering into the question of the means by which this was effected. 
Upon that point I could only offer conjectures. 
Organic Chemistry, pp. 9, 10, 69, 72, second American edition, Cambridge, 1841. The key to 
Liehbig’s position is this: Humus is decayed vegetation, therefore vegetation must have pre- 
ceded humus. But there isa difference between alichen growing cn an undisintegrated rock 
in “symbiosis” with a microbe and a wheat plant growing in soil or as it is called disintegrated 
rock.

manure, which conclusion so exercised Mr. Georges Ville that he was lead up 
to publishing a ‘‘School of Manures,” in which the ‘‘student” is told by the “pro- _ 
fessor” that it is not necessary to manure a 
clover field with farmyard manure for the pur- 
pose of nitrogenating it, as clover gets all its 
nitrogen from the air, and the phosphate, pot- 
ash, and lime it requires may be best put on 
as mineral matter, “‘for manure only acts by 
the nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and lime it 
contains.”! 
Perhaps the situation in 1850 had not changed 
very much from that of 1804, when Saussure 
wrote, ‘‘1f nitrogen is a simple body, if it is not 
apart of water, it must be conceded that plants 
assimilate it only in the form of vegetable and 
animal extracts (humus), in ammonia vapor, 
or in other compounds dissolved in water, 
which they can take from soil or air; for it 
must be admitted that when a plant grows in 
a confined atmosphere by the help of a little 
distilled water, the new growth gains nitrogen 
at the expense of the parts that had been formed 
before the experiment commenced.”* At all 
events, when Pasteur, in 1862, said that the 
entire study of nitrification would have to be 
all done over again, no one thought his criti- 
cismilltimed. But before exposing the devel- 
opments made by the new line of investigation, 
it is desirable to show the structure and func- 
tion of an organism which M. Pasteur found 
in a wine tub, Mr. Tyndall even in the pure air 
of the Alps, and M. Schloesing and others, 
more wonderful still, found in the ground— 
the ubiquitous microbe in all its bewildering 
uncertainty of an administering and a destroy- 
ing angel. 
For the present purpose microbes may be 
divided into two classes, one of which, in the 
air or in oxygen, will manifest its properties as 
a ferment, while the other will only work ina 
vacuum or in an atmosphere of carbonic acid 
or hydrogen gas. Both sets require oxygen, 
but the set that works in a vacuum, etc., has 
the ability to break up compounds containing 
oxygen in order to obtain that absolutely nec- 
essary element of life, hence it is called an an- 
aerobe, while the microbes, that work in an 
oxygenated atmosphere like common air, are 
called aerobes. The dreadful scourge of hos- 
pital amputations, known as septicemia or blood 
poisoning, is caused by an anaerobe, which finds 
a breeding place in the carbonic-acid gas sur-

of blood, and the carbonic-acid gas and marsh gas produced at the bottom of a 
manure pile are due to the same cause. On this occasion an aerobe, the Asper- 
gillus niger, is chosen for illustration for reasons that will suggest themselves as 
its performances are related. 
This aspergillus (aspergillus, a brush, and niger, black) lifts its black tuft of 
spores above the mycelium or network which ramifies in the liquid that nourishes 
it. From this mycelium little cylindrical columns somewhat larger than the 
threads of the mycelium run up into the air, terminating in heads formed after 
the manner of a dandelion ball or tuft when the yellow flower has fallen, except 
that the many projecting bodies of the aspergillus are black instead of white and 
carry balls or ‘‘spores” at their extremities instead of gossamer stars, 
Now, suppose one or more of these balls or spores should be sown in a liquid at 
blood heat, made up of ingredients such as these:!

Then certain precautions of a technical nature necessary for the experimenter, 
but not for the reader, to know being taken, there will appear in eighteen or 
twenty-four hours a mycelium (c of the cut) at first white, but after the lapse of 
another day yellow and then brownish, and finally black because of the deposit 
of spores. Now, what is the influence of the potash, for instance, upon the 
growth of the aspergillus? The answer is found in this way: Take two recepta- 
cles, one containing the liquid given above and the other the liquid minus the 
potash. The whole liquid will produce 25 grams of dried plant or fungus; the 
liquid, without potash, will produce only 1 gram. The suppression of the potash 
has caused the product (dried) of the aspergillus to fall twenty-four times. Let us 
then say that its usefulness is measured by the number 25, and in the same way 
(growing two crops so as to exhaust the liquid and measuring both crops) it is 
found that the value of—

The numbers opposite ammonia, phosphoric acid, potash, and magnesia need 
not astonish us, says M. Du Claux, chief of the Pasteur Institute, they having long 
been known to be excellent manures. 
Microbes acting thusare called ferments; that is, they break upa chemical com- 
pound in which they start to grow into elements which are left free to rearrange 
themselves, it may be assumed, in new combinations. In such a way wine is 
turned into vinegar and animal bodies into dust. After having been used to 
explain the diseases of men, beasts, silkworms, beer, milk, and cheese, the microbe 
is now offered as an explanation of fertility. The discovery of this function of 
the microbe is due to two French chemists, Messrs. Schloesing and Mintz, who 
have so candidly described the beautiful experiment which acquainted them with 
the fact that their joint ‘‘note” to the French Academy of Sciences (in 1877)? is 
given nearly in full.

Note to the French Academy of Sciences, by Messrs. Th. Schloesing and A. Miintz, 
concerning nitrification of the soil by organic ferments.* 
It is generally admitted that the nitrates which are formed in the soil come from 
the burning (chemically) of ammonia and nitrogenous matter of organic origin, 
put there is no agreement upon the mechanism by which this burning is done. Is 
the nitrification a result of direct reaction, purely chemical, between oxygen gas 
and nitrogen compounds; is it brought about by the intermediation of organisms 
acting as ferments; or, indeed, is it produced by both of these actions working in 
concert? These questions have been asked since the day when M. Pasteur showed 
that certain organisms—such as the so-called ‘‘ mycoderma” of wine and vinegar— 
have the property of introducing the oxygen of the air into organized substances 
of the most miscellaneous kinds, and also that they are the most active agents in 
the destruction of organized or, so to speak, biological matter which has lost its 
vitality. Now, M. Pasteur has also shown that organic substances (which are, 
at least, as alterable as those which may be supposed to nitrify in the soil) oppose 
a singular resistance to oxygen when they are protected from all contact with 
germs of a fermenting organism. In putting these two facts together we are led 
to suppose that living agents must intervene to effect combustion in the soil, at 
least in the case of rapid combustion and nitrification, without our being obliged 
for all that to refuse to free oxygen, working in virtue of chemical forces, the 
faculty of burning and of nitrifying nitrogenous matters. In short, we assume a 
living as well as an inert chemical agent in the destruction of dead organic 
matter. 
Convinced of the truth of these conceptions, M. Pasteur since 1862 has constantly 
asserted that the study of nitrification must be made ever from the point of view 
of the function in nature of the microbe. The experiment we are about to report 
confirms the anticipations of M. Pasteur without just now rigorously maintaining 
their truth. 
One of us [Miintz] while occupied recently with an investigation concerning 
the irrigation of land with sewage water desired to ascertain whether the presence 
of humic matter in a soil is indispensable to effect the purification of water of that 
kind. In short, is humus necessary to cause the total burning up of all impuri- 
ties held in solution by sewage water? To this end, a large giass tube 40 inches 
long was filled with 11 pounds of quartz sand, which had been purified of all 
organic matter by being exposed to a red heat and then mixed with 100 metric 
grams of carbonate of lime in powder. The sand was watered every day with 
the same quantity of sewage water, put on in such a manner that the liquid 
took eight days to descend through the tube. During the first twenty days no 
appearance of nitrification was produced, and the proportion of the ammonia 
in the water filtered in this way remained invariable. On the twenty-first day 
the niter appeared and increased very rapidly, and then it was evidént that the 
sewage waiter on leaving the apparatus contained no trace of ammonia. 
Let us assume that in the fact above related the oxygen and nitrogenated matter 
had been burned chemically by the oxygen working directly on the organic mat- 
ter held by the water, that is, burned it like nitric acid will burn a copper plate. 
or oxygen will rust (i. e., burn) a nail ina moist atmosphere. In that case the 
question might be asked why the burning had waited twenty days before it began. 
That delay is better accounted for upon the hypothesis that it was caused by a 
living ferment which is not able to work, evidently, unless, after their germs have 
been sowed, they have had time to develop. 
The experiment commenced in June and had continued four months, when it 
occurred to us to introduce into the apparatus the vapor of chloroform. One of 
us [Miintz] had shown that this substance suspends all activity among living fer- 
ments without in any manner interfering (entraver) with soluble ferments. If, 
then, the nitrification observed in our apparatus after the twentieth day was pro- 
duced by organic beings, chloroform ought to stop it by putting those organisms 
to sleep.. If, on the contrary, the nitrification was a mere chemical reaction, the 
chloroform would have no effect in stopping nitrification, which would go on as 
before. Accordingly we placed upon our sand in the tube a little vase full of 
chloroform and diffused its vapor through the tube bya current of forced air. As 
we have said, it took eight days for the daily dose of sewage waters to run through 
the sand. Thus we were unable to note the immediate effect, but after ten days 
the liquid running through contained no trace of niter; on the contrary, the 
ammonia of the water was again found in its complete totality. The filtered

liquid when evaporated now left a deposit perceptibly colored, having an odor 
such as is given out by filtered but unpurified sewage water. 
After having continued our chloroforming of the contents of the tube for fifteen 
days (November 27 to December 12), we removed the little dish which contained 
that liquid. During the next fifteen days the water running through the tube 
continued to give off the odor of chloroform. This odor, however, disappeared 
toward the end of December. Nevertheless during all January, the tube remain- 
ing at a mean temperature of 15° C, (59° F.), not a trace of niter was found. Our 
nitrifying organisms were dead without a doubt, and the sewage water did not 
furnish germs to replace them, perhaps because it was not in a sufficiently 
advanced stage of putrefaction. 
On the ist of February we determined to endeavor to sow the nitrifying germs 
in the tube. A vegetable soil we thought should contain it. We dissolved 10 
metric grams of a soil well known to us for its aptitude to nitrify in water and, 
agitating it the while, poured it upon the sand in our tube. We expected the 
niter to appear after eight days. It appeared on February 9. The proportion 
increased, and we think that very soon the old state of things before the introduc- 
tion of chloroform will be restored. It now remains for us to discover and isolate 
the nitrifying organisms. 
Ten years elapsed before the microbe of nitrification was discovered and iso- 
lated. The honor of having done this is given to Messrs. Hellriegel and Wil- 
farth. These investigators discovered that the nodes or bumps upon the roots 
of leguminous plants were nitrogenating forms of a microbous nature. But itis 
_ desirable to pass to the experiment of Messrs. Schloesing, jr., and Laurent, 
described in their note to the French Academy of Sciences,! for in it they appre- 
ciate the value of the discovery and the methods of Messrs. Hellriegel and 
Wilfarth. They relate the results of their experiment in these words: 
Messrs. Hellriegel and Wilfarth have shown within the last few years that the 
leguminos are capable of fixing the nitrogen gas of the atmosphere in conjunc- 
tion with certain micro-organisms whose activity corresponds to the development 
of the swellings or bumps (nodosities) upon the roots. 
In the case of a question of this importance it is useful to multiply the proofs 
and to give them the utmost possible accuracy. Now, Messrs. Hellriegel and Wil- 
farth confined themselves in their investigations to the indirect method which is 
founded upon the simple analysis of soils, seeds, and plants. It therefore still 
remained to demonstrate the origin of the nitrogen taken up by the leguminosa, 
excluding that in the seeds and soils, by using the direct method. To do this it 
was necessary to grow the plants under such conditions that they would be able 
to fix gaseous nitrogen and to measure this fixation by the amount of nitrogen 
consumed.” 
The difficulties in making such an experiment are obvious. In order to find 
accurately the variation of the nitrogen gas the volume of the atmosphere (which, 
for the purposes of the experiment, is isolated from the atmosphere) is made as 
small as possible. Since it is impossible either to let in at the beginning in the 
apparatus all the carbonic acid which is necessary for the eseieaOn of the plants

2The French chemists distinguish two kinds of analysis, which they respectively name 
analyse immediate and analyse élémentaire. M. Troast, in his Chemistry, p. 692, 1884 edition, 
describes them thus: “‘ Organic substances rarely exist apart in vegetable organs, being combined 
or mixed with others (elles y sont soit combinées soit mélangées les unes aux autres). If it 
is desired to determine the physical and chemical properties of these ingredients, it is there- 
fore necessary to completely separate them. In doing this an “analyse immédiate” is made. 
It is a very delicate process, as it is essential that nothing shall be done or used that will alter 
the character of the substances being sought for. To prevent contamination of these sub- 
stances, a temperature of fusion or of boiling is used. Crystallization, in very many cases, gives 
invaluable information. When it is certain that the isolated body is a true chemical substance, 
the investigator may pass to the analyse élémentaire, the object of which is to make known both 
the nature and the relative proportions of the simple or elemental bodies [gases ?] of which itis 
formed. This consists in burning by oxidation the carbon and hydrogen [in the substance] 
which pass off in the state of carbonic-acid gas and water vapor. From the weight of these 
compounds is deduced the weight of carbon and that of hydrogen (e. g., 44 grams of carbonic 
acid contain 12 of carbon, and 9 grams of water contain 1 of hydrogen). The quantity (dose) 
of oxygen is indicated by the difference. As to nitrogen, that is determined by a second opera- 
tion, the gas being either free or “ammonia.” This was first used by Gay Lussac in 1810.

or to take out afterwards all the oxygen which is produced by the breaking up 
of the carbonic acid by the chlorophyll, it is necessary to provide for furnishing 
the carbonic acid as it is wanted and then to withdraw the oxygen set free by the 
leaves as the experiment proceeds. 
In a kind of elongated cylinder of glass we introduced sand, out of which all 
organic matter had been first burned and then saturated with a mineral solution free 
from nitrogen, in which the plant will grow. Every precaution is taken to keep 
germs from the air out of the apparatus. In the sand are sowed three seeds of 
dwarf pease (pois Gouthier), and these are watered with a little pure water in 
which there has been placed some fresh nitrogen nodes ground up in a mortar 
(broyé),! taken from pease and beans that have grown in the open air. Thecylin- 
der is then placed ina south window. The seeds sprout, and we continue our 
experiment for three months, August to October, two trials being made. 
The pease did not grow very large, but they were healthy and, for their size, vig- 
orous. They flowered, but did not fruit. The figures are these:

It is impossible to attribute these differences to errors which were caused by 
the method pursued. Suppose that in each measurement the maximum error 
was committed, and counting all the errors in such a sense that they would pro- 
duce the greatest possible error in the total, yet this would not exceed 3 cubic 
centimeters. 
An examination of the plants at the end of the experiment brought out the fact 
that there were a large number of nodes upon their roots. ©

  To sum up: The indirect method shows that there was a gain of nitrogen dur- 
ing the course of growth, while the direct method shows that this gain is really 
due to the fixation of nitrogen gas, for when the apparatus had been all connected. 
together a perfect vacuum was created in all its parts, and then this vacuum was 
filled with, first, pure oxygen, 20 to 25 parts; pure carbonic-acid gas, 6 to 9 parts, 
and pure nitrogen, 65 to 70 parts, the last being measured with the greatest possi- 
ble exactitude by means of a volumeter. 
When this ‘‘note” had been read to the academy, M. Berthelot observed: “This 
note seems to me to close the polemic relative to the fixation of free nitrogen by 
the concurrence of the soil and the plant. It shows, indeed, in confirmation of a

mented mushrooms. While some botanists refuse them ‘‘all autonomy,” Laurent thinks they

a germ or from land carrying microbes.

long series of my observations since 1883 and confirmed by Messrs. Deherain, 
Frank, and Tacke, together with the observations made by Hellriegel and Wil- 
farth, Bréal, and Prozmowski, that the soil and plants enrich themselves with 
nitrogen by the influence of microbes, microbes of which I discovered the pres- 
ence in the soil and of which the German savants have discovered the parasitism 
and specific action upon the roots of the leguminose.” 
As beautiful and as important as was the experiment with chloroform by 
Professors Schloesing, sr., and Mintz, it is possible to think that it did not sur- 
pass in the latter particular still another experiment of Schloesing, jr., and Lau- 
rent in 1891. They made two tests. In the first they found that nonleguminous 
plants absorbed nitrogen just as in the year before by the same method they had 
proved that fact of the leguminous plants. This surprising result was not credited, 
however, for certain mosses (Brynum, Leptobrynum, rootless plants) and alge 
(conferva, oscellaria, nitzschia, likewise rootless) and other like green plants of 
“low orders” were seen little by little to cover the soil, A second series of experi- 
mentation was undertaken in which the green plants of the lower orders were 
smothered out by a thin layer of calcined quartz sand. After that no plant except 
those of the leguminous order was found to fix nitrogen. From these tests they 
drew two conclusions: (1) There are green plants of a low order botanically, 
which take nitrogen from the air, and (2). nonleguminous plants do not fix nitro- 
gen in a measurable quantity, while under the same conditions a legumin will. 
But despite the present accentuation of nitrogen as a food of plants taken in 
through the roots, as nitric acid (?), it has not always held its present. position. 
Saussure wrote in 1804: ‘I ave found the phosphate of lime in the ashes of 
every plant I-have examined, and there is no reason to suppose that plants 
can exist without it.”! Liebig speaks more openly: ‘Ashes of plants represent 
the whole nourishment which vegetables receive from the soil. By furnishing 
them in sufficient quantities to our meadows we give to the plants growing in 
them the power of condensing and absorbing carbon and nitrogen by their sur- 
face. With a knowledge of the cxact quantity of ashes the farmer will be able to 
keep an exact record of the produce of his fields in harvest, like the account book 
of a well-regulated manufactory, and then by a simple calculation he can deter- 
mine precisely the substances he must supply to each field, and the quantity of 
these in order to restore their fertility.” Well might Boussingault, a scientist, 
say that the experience of many farmers was worth more than the opinion of one 
scientist. He, indeed, acknowledges that artificial fertilizers, including, of course, 
nitrate of potash, are ‘‘ mineral manures or stimulants,” but remarks that, ‘‘Ashes, 
gypsum, or lime spread upon the soil would not improve it in any sensible degree;” 
and, having thus seemingly contradicted Liebig, goes on to partially acknowledge 
the justice of Liebig’s pretension that nitrogen is unnecessary by saying that 
nitrogenous stuff alone (such as nitric acid) would be no better than the alkalis 
or phosphates or limes. What is necessary is a combination of the two, one the 
nitrogen coming definitely from the air (certainly Liebig’s contention), the other 
from the ‘‘solid parts of the globe”? (which ‘‘ other” Liebig wanted put on when 
not present in the parts of a portion of the globe to be manured). Comparing 
these statements with the experiments of Messrs. Schloesing, jr., and Laurent, it 
will be found that if the microbe be called manure both Liebig and Boussingault 
are right, at least as far as the leguminous plants are concerned, though both were 
quite ignorant of the facts in the case. What, then, do plants get out of the soil? 
And we are recalled to Saussure’s work. 
It was believed by many before Saussure that plants elaborated for themselves 
the ashes left when they were consumed by fire. It seemed so natural to think so

that no one took the trouble to show that it was so.! Some had found that the 
green parts of trees and plants give more ash than twigs and the twigs more than 
the limbs or trunk, others that annual plants transpire water more freely than 
a tree, but it remained for Saussure to make the analyses that were used for more 
than half a century, 
Let us take two of Saussure’s analyses of ashes:?

  It is very evident where the phosphates are needed in an agricultural seed plant. 
But in order to show how small a part all the ash constituents of a seed are of the 
unburned seed the following analysis is taken from Boussingault * to supplement 
those of Saussure given above:+

It has thus been shown that two gases of the atmosphere, carbonic acid and 
nitrogen, are used by nature in building up that part of the plant structure which, 
when wood is treated by fire in a certain way we call charcoal, but cellular 
structure when the plant is merely dried by a heat that evaporates the uncom- 
pined or chemically loose water which it holds mechanically in its framework. It 
is supposed, probably proved, that the carbonic acid broken up by the leaf is the 
source of its cellulose, and that its nitrogenous matter is elaborated by the same 
agency. No space has been devoted to proving that plants absorb water, nor has 
any notice been taken of the fact that water is thought to be decomposed into its 
elements, hydrogen and oxygen, by the plant. If such decomposition does occur 
it occurs within the plant, though the formation of the carbohydrates (cellulose,

silica, alumina, lime, and magnesia “are formed in organized bodies.”

4Liebig classified cultivated plants into potash plants, lime plants, and silica plants, according 
to the presence of those substances in the ash of the straw. Potash plants are corn, the beets 
turnip, etc.; lime plants are peas and clover; and silica plants are those from which the staff 
of life is obtained—wheat ,rye, oats, and barley.

starch, etc.) may possibly be formed without the decomposition of water. What- 
ever authority deems true on this point will be given when treating of the self- 
activity of plants. But there can be no doubt that the ashes represent the con- 
tribution of the soil to the plant, and that the matter so furnished is, in the form 
of silica, decidedly present in the straw and, in the form of phosphorus, equally 
present in the seed. On the other hand, it is to nitrogen that the philosophers of 
vegetation of the last half of the nineteenth century would attribute the charac- 
teristic of vigor, and, indeed, the value of ammonia and of phosphoric acid in the 
Aspergillus experiment seems not unconnected with its heavy crop of spores and 
the heavy growth that produced them. Therefore by leaving out of considera- 
tion the ash elements we may make a diagram somewhat as follows:

THE AGRICULTURAL PROCESS. 
In the foregoing we have been dealing with hypotheses founded on experiments 
conducted according to the canons of induction.'_ An experimentor series of simi- 
lar experiments furnished a new truth or a proof of a speculative conception, and 
this the syllogism classified and converted into a theory that was true as far 
as the whole meaning attached to the words were not contradicted by other facts 
not yet recognized as connected with the question or as yet unknown. The dis- 
covery of a truth in this way is almost always brought about by human interference 
and, if the statement be not held too rigidly to the exact meaning of its terms, 
it may be said that the method disregards time and place. But there is another 
method of discovering truth in nature, which Mr. Mill in his logic calls a ‘‘collo- 
cation of facts,” which is illustrated by Kepler's discovery of the mathematical 
figure made by the planets in their passage around the sun.? Time and place in 
an investigation such as this, requiring the collocation of an immense number of 
observations of other astronomers through a long course of years, are the very 
elements of a discovery or the making of a scientific generalization. 
An investigation on the collocation of facts system has been going on at Roth- 
amsted for over fifty years. Nature is not interrogated in a flower pot at that 
establishment, and the results of a uniform treatment of the fields under observa- 
tion has been purified by the variations of a continuous number of seasons. Itis 
an agricultural experiment station where nature is besieged, not attacked sword 
inhand. The inquiries at Rothamsted may be said to include two great problems: 
The one relating to the effect of variations in soil conditions under fluctuating 
atmospheric conditions on the crops; the other being the reciprocal problem as to 
the effect of crops upon the soil. 
It may be of service here to ask ‘‘ What is a soil?” It is said that it is disinte- 
grated rock, and thus the question becomes an investigation of the conditions 
which cause disintegrated rock to grow the plants which undisintegrated rock 
refuses tonourish and of the source of rock. To follow the last out would require 
us to follow the earth—a satellite of the sun like the moon is of the earth, itself— 
back to the time when it was being disengaged from the sun* as Saturn is now to

be seen disengaging ‘“‘rings,” and when the earth as an original part of the sun 
was possibly a blazing mass of hydrogen.! Nor would such an excursion be 
satisfactory, for it would be necessary to look upon the rocks as the slag or sedi- 
ment of the terrific combustion or a cold form of hydrogen gas which is given off 
when most metals are heated.’ This, therefore, will suffice that the rocks, particle 
by particle, are being carried away toward the sea by water which is a compound 
of hydrogen. Yet the action of water, either in its liquid or glacial state, in 
grinding down the rocks so as to catch and hold fertility, is not agriculturally 
speaking of so much interest as its offices in effecting the formation of decayed 
vegetable matter or humus, which certainly is not a cooled rock. This organic 
soil is the product of water vapor which originally fed the primitive plants of 
which the alge. and the lichens, though air-fed plants are, comparatively speaking, 
highly evolved forms. 
From the decay of such forms has arisen the vegetable soil of the globe or 
humus, which changed under mechanical pressure by heat and exclusion from air, 
is burnt beneath the boilers of our steam engines in the form of coal, and when 
reconyerted into vegetation is consumed in the animal body. How soon this vege- 
tation appeared after the earth had lost its heat can not be said; but it is not too 
much to say that it awaited the first clouds, if not the actual fall of rain.? Howit 
began or whether nature is even now calling from unorganized matter new forms 
of life is a question that must be left to those who believe in the creation of an 
unique parental cell and slow process of natural selection or ‘‘evolution,” and 
their opponents, who uphold ‘‘spontaneous generation.” 
There are but few facts in the history of the earth’s surface that are not easily 
matters of unlimited controversy. Even of the Tertiary-Quaternary period which 
immediately preceded our own we only know that nature seems to have special- 
ized her backboned creatures from the extraordinary beasts—half giraffe and half 
alligator, the restorations of which people our museums—to a wholly land animal, 
and changed an as yet unknown climate to one of intermittent periods of ice 
  
1 Mr. Lockyer’s Meteoric Hypothesis. Ina letter in French published by theFrench Academy 
of Sciences this astronomer put his earlier theory in these simple sentences. The hotter a star 
is the simpler is its spectrum [fewer kinds of stuffs it has in it] and the metalliferous elements 
appear in the order of their weight, taking hydrogen as 1. So we have (1) very brilliant stars 
in which are only to be seen hydrogen in enormous quantities and magnesium, (2) cooler stars 
as our sun in which we find hydrogen + magnesium + sodium, or instead of sodium, calcium, iron, 
ete., but no metalloids [oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and in fact he might have said 
and did almost say so in the original letter, the minerals of the vegetable kingdom], (8) cooler 
stars still in which all the metal elements are associated and their lines are no longer visible in 
the spectrum, but where we find the spectrum of the metalloids and the compounds [such as on 
the carth?]. Finally the older a star becomes the less there is seen of free hydrogen, and on our 
globe we find no free hydrogen (p. 344, of the Meteoric Hypothesis). It wouldappear that Mr. 
Lockyer’s present view is that a swarm of meteors coming together increase in heat until they 
become a brilliant star like Sirius, and then having reached their limit of gaseous condensation 
and being, therefore, at their hottest begin to solidify. See Note A, to this chapter. 
2In Professor Ramsay’s address as president of chemistry section, British Association for 
Advancement of Science (Toronto, reported in Nature, August 19, 1897), he says: ‘‘ Most minerals 
give off gas when heated, and the gas contains as a rule a considerable amount of hydrogen.” 
8 “‘As soon as the central heat ceased to act upon the temperature of the surface of the globe 
and of the atmosphere, the precipitation of vapors must have become almost general * * * 
and from the first drop of water which fell upon the still burning surface of the earth to the 
first ray of sunlight which shone upon the ocean is the period when the geologist must look for 
the plutonic forces upon the crust of the globe.” (Revolutions of the Crust of the Earth, by 
Professor Pilar, University of Brussels.) Mr. T. Sterry Hunt, in a statement prepared at Pro- 
fessor Henry’s request, which is published as ‘‘On the Chemistry of the Earth,” says: “The 
part which vegetation has played in the chemical history of the globe has not been limited to 
purifying the air of carbonic acid. It seems to have been the great agent through which so 
large a force has effected a partial decomposition of the thoroughly burned or oxidized mate- 
rials of the primitive world. By means of growing plants carbonic acid and water are reduced, 
giving rise to the various forms of carbon and to hydrocarbonaceous bodies, which act upon 
the sulphates deoxidizing them.”

sheets ‘‘a mile or two thick.” There are, however, a few facts furnished by 
geologic changes of an organic nature now in course of consummation that will 
serve to give, no matter how faintly, a conception, based on recorded experience, 
of the difference between the inorganic and the organic substances which form 
the aerated surface of the globe. 
To those who for pleasure or health have visited Florida, especially the region 
of the chain of lakes whose waters, known as the Kissimmee River, first collect in 
Lake Tohopekalega and ooze out from Okeechobee into the ocean, it is useless to 
explain that the country is flat and that the geological soil or ‘‘ disintegrated rock” 
issand. To those who have watched in that region the matter floated out of a 
descending pipe on its way to tap artesian water and to those who have tasted 
that water when found, it would be equally useless to say that the region is lifted 
above the Atlantic by a pedestal which, partly, at least, has been constructed by 
a coral-making animal.! To them it will not be difficult to show that the portion 
of the Floridian peninsula which is bounded on the west by the sluggish waters 
of the St. Johns and the Kissimmee, and on the east by the Gulf Stream, isa 
product of a sea change. 
When the waters of the caldron-like Gulf receive the mechanical impress that 
shoots them through the narrow neck of sea that separates Cuba from Florida, 
the rapid current eddies in the open Atlantic, and so far as it does so deposits the 
suspended matters its waters have gathered up from the sediments of the Orinoco, 
the Mississippi, and the mountain torrents of the eastern slopes of the cordilleras 
of Spanish North America.? Thus the ocean stream, keeping its channel clear by 
the force of its own momentum, makes a delta for itself in the ocean as the 
Mississippi makes its “‘ passes” in the Gulf. 
Observe the cross section, fig. 3. At the right we have the Gulf Stream sweep- 
ing along in its 400 or 500 fathoms groove between precipitous banks of 2 or 3 
fathoms below the surface on the Bahama Island side and of 30 or 40 fathoms on 
the Florida side, and rapidly shoaling as it approaches the Floridian keys. Here 
isthe opportunity of the coral-making animal. Nourished by a warm, swift food- 
bearing current, the coral animal can excel the builders of the Egyptian pyramids. 
To aid the imagination the mound marked ‘Coral reef” may be taken as a begin- 
ning of a process which has resulted in the formation of Everglades and the Atlantic 
side of Florida, and then let the steps be given in the words of Professor LeConte:? 
On the living reef islands have just commenced to form. Some are yet only a 
collection of large coral fragments, the nucleus of an island. Some are more com- 
pacted by smaller fragments thrown in among the larger. Some are small, but 
perfect islands, i. e., coral, sand, and mud have been thrown upon and completely 
buried the large mass. But none of these are yet clothed with vegetation, much 
less inhabited by either animals or men. Next come the larger, inhabited islands 
of the line of keys [where it has been picturesquely remarked that horticulture 
is carried on with a butcher knife and a crowbar]. On cutting into these the 
same structure as described above is revealed. These are a string of wave- 
formed coral islands, and here was once a line of living reef, but the corals have 
long ago died, because cut off from the open sea by the formation of another reef 
farther out. Next comes the southern coast. Examination of this reveals the 
same structure precisely. Here, then, was the place of a still earlier reef. The 
formation of barrier reefs without subsidence may be accounted for thus: From

Smithsonian Institution, in his ‘‘ New Astronomy: ‘‘ The explosion which occurred at Krakatao 
August 27, 1883, was heard, according to official evidence, at a distance of 1,800 miles, and the puff 
of its air wave injured buildings 200 miles distant, and, we repeat, carried into the highest 
regions of the atmosphere and around the world matter which it is at least possible still (1892)

the manner in which, by my view, the bases of the coral reefs have been formed, 
viz, by deposition of sediment, there must have always existed a very soft, shallow 
sea bottom. Along such a shore line a fringing reef could not form, because the

(flowing south) rivers being considered to have been in the past what the so-called Indian and 
Halifax rivers (mere salt-water lagoons, fenced off by outlying sand bars or keys) are now.

water is 100 feet deep, and the waves no longer touch the bottom, a line of reef 
would form, limited on the inside by the muddiness and on the out or ocean side 
by the trough of the Gulf Stream. This would be in form a barrier reef, but 
wholly different in signification from those of the Pacific.

But Professor LeConte was merely interested in the contributions of animals to 
the geology of Florida so far as those contributions served to check the too wide 
application of the theory that as a mountain in the South Pacific sank into the 
waters of that sea the coral animals built up a ring around the sinking mass, 
which, starting on the submerged and sloping side of the mountain, grew upward 
and inward as the mountain sunk, and when the mountain had slowly disappeared 
beneath the surface became its sepulcher—a narrow ring of verdure-dotted coral 
a dozen miles or more around separating the quiet surface of a lagoon from the 
wind-tossed waters of the open sea.! But imagine this open sea to be replaced by 
land as flat, though not as easily moved by the wind, as the surface of the sea; 
imagine the coral band that holds the lagoon to be replaced by a ridge of sand 
covered with cypress or even less amphibious trees, and the greenish water 
exchanged for one stained blue black, and the atoll of the South Pacific is changed 
into the rim and basin of a Floridian lake. As wind and wave drive floating 
matter upon the coral reef from without, so the same agencies from within drive 
upon the shore of the lakes in the prairie regions of the Kissimmee the sand and 
decaying vegetable matters that their shallow bottoms ever give up to the waves 
created by the heavy winds that sweep across their surface. But behind the ridge 
thus formed there is a depression something like that existing between the coral 
reef and the sinking mountain peak, which is sheltered from the wind by the rim 
of the basin and kept moist by the drainage water of the surrounding land, which 
is cut off from the lake by this rim. In that climate all the elements for growth 
of coarse vegetation—heat, moisture, and quiet—are present and there soon 
appears over the whole surface of the white sand a skin of black. Where flats have 
existed such as those through which a tortuous Floridian creek empties itself, or 
joins two lakes, the conditions are such that beds of muck 2, 3, 4, or more feet 
are created, which when the lakes are drained are exposed to view. The soluble 
portion of this decayed vegetation or humus, though brown in color, lends the 
lakes under certain. sky effects there a dark-blue shade, but does not appear to 
contaminate their waters. 
But this water-logged humus is quite different from the leaf mold of the forest. 
No mosses add nitrogen to its substance while it is sopped in water; no nitrog- 
enated air circulates within its body; no trees prevent the fierce chemical action 
of the sun upon its spongy surface. Cracks wide enough for a man to thrust his 
arm in seam its body, and it will smolder for weeks when ignited from the fires 
set to the tree like weeds that naturally spring up when it is by drainage freed 
from stagnant water. The whole mass halts between a coal bed and a garden 
soil, and as yet is neither. How different the humus of the forest-covered moun- 
tain sides. A myriad of bugs and worms aerate the mass and knead it with the 
geologic soil upon which it rests. Thus it acquires a smaller range of variation 
under extremes of extension by moisture and of shrinkage by dryness than it natu- 
rally possesses, and though it works its way slowly down into the valleys, enough 
is still retained upon the slopes to insure the existence of the mountain forest. 
Thus, while nature is tirelessly making ‘“‘muck” upon the banks of the Gulf 
Stream opposite Florida, man upon our mountain side is with equal industry 
baring the rocks of ‘‘humus” by processes which two hundred years ago had left 
no alternative to the governments of Europe but to interfere to prevent a national 
calamity. 
With some hesitation as to the entire propriety of its introduction in support 
of the difference between swamp muck and forest humus, but still, as suggestive,

  This explains the difference between ‘‘muck” and ‘‘humus.” It is a difference 
between the generation of two forms of carbon, one of which (carbonic acid) in 
daylight is useful to the leaves of plants but not to the roots, and nitrogen, which 
is useful to the roots, no matter how theory fixes up the modus of the process, but. 
not to the leaves. 
_ ‘The universal opinion,” says Professor Liebig ‘‘ that the substance called humus. 
is extracted from the soil by the roots of plants for the purpose of assimilation is 
untenable, for there are the most conclusive proofs that humus in the form in 
which it exists in the soil does not yield the smallest nourishment to plants.” 
Which statement he endeavors to substantiate by applying the arithmetic of the 
chemical laboratory to the ‘‘amount of basic metallic oxides, potash, soda, lime, 
magnesia, iron, and manganese” produced annually, ‘‘on the average,” by the 
growth of firewood on an acre of Hessian pine trees.® 
Against this argumentation of the brilliant chemist the accurate and cautious 
experimenter Saussure may be quoted: ‘‘ Plants do not take all their mineral food 
out of solutions such as those which are artificially made by dissolving hydro- 
cloride of lime, iron, or manganese in pure water; but they take them for the 
most part from compounds which we are unable to form, namely, out of such 
compounds in which these salts are chemically combined with oxygen, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, and carbon in humus extract, a fact that can only be revealed to us by 
an examination of the ashes of the plant.” As-there is nothing in the ingenious 
guesses, though based on remarkable experiments, which have affected Saussure’s. 
statement made in 1804, and as in the “arid soil” of the desert, though there is 
only one-fourth as much humus as in a “humid soil,” that arid humus is three 
times richer in nitrogen than the humus of the “humid soil,”? the statement of 
M, de Saussure will be adopted as the truth so far as known for practical agricul- 
ture, but see pp. 957 and 960. 
Man nevertheiess is not the only agency that denudes the mountain sides of their 
mold. In many parts of England a weight of more than 10 tons of dry earth 
passes annually through the body of the worms contained within the boundaries 
of a single acre and by them is brought to its surface. In woods, if the loose 
leaves of autumn are removed, the whole surface will be found strewed with the 
castings. A professor in charge of the State forests near Nancy, France, has 
pointed out this circumstance as a beautiful example of the natural cultivation 
of the soil. Thus, on hillsides, a considerable quantity of elaborated earth is 
moving down into every valley. Butif the trees are there moisture is there, and 
with moisture mosses, fungi, and worms, the agricultural implements of nature.

with sand, in which fallen leaves were strewed, and these were soon dragged into 
their burrows to a depth of 3 inches. In six weeks an almost uniform layer of 
sand four-tenths of an inch in thickness was conyerted into humus by passing 
through the alimentary canals of these two worms. But it is not by flower-pot 
experiments alone that this matter has been proved. 
“On December 20, 1842,” says Mr. Darwin, ‘‘a quantity of freshly broken chalk 
‘was spread over a part of a field near my house which had existed as pasture cer- 
tainly for thirty years. The chalk was put there to note the distance down it 
would bo found at some future time. Twenty-nine years after (November, 1871), 
a trench was dug across this part of the field, and a line of white nodules could be 
traced in both sides of the trench at adepth of 7 inches from the surface. Exclud- 
ing the turf, the mold had been thrown up at an average rate of two-tenths of 
anincha year. Another part of the same field was mossy, and, as it was thought 
that sifted coal cinders would improve the pasture, a thick layer was spread over 
this part either in 1842 or 1843 and another layer some years after. In 1871 a 
trench was dug, and many cinders lay in a line at a depth of 7 inches beneath the 
surface and another line at a depth of 54 inches parallel to the one beneath. Had 
the land been plowed land, instead of being permanent pasture,” continues Mr. 
Darwin, ‘“‘the accumulation of mold in that field would probably not have been Calciferous glands.

so fast; had it been thicker, it would probably have been slower.” He had a slop- 
ing field called the “stony field,” the large stones of which he doubted in 1841 if 
he should ever live to see the worms cover up when he put it down to pasture to 
start the process going. In 1871 a horse might gallop over the field and not strike 
a single stone. The thickness of the matted turf was not quite half an inch, 
then came 2} inches of stoneless mold, then coarse clayey earth full of flints, such 
as could be found in the fields around. The average rate of the accumulation 
above the sinking stones was not quite 1 inch in twelve years, or 0.083 inch a year. 
The form of this extraordinary agricultural animal is well known. With the 
exception of the fisherman, few care to come in contact with the creature, and its 
defenselessness is proverbial, The inside of the worm is not more attractive 
than the outside, as may be seen from the sketch herewith annexed. Through 
this train of vital mechanism pass enormous quantities of dirt, which is dis- 
charged by the animal at the mouth of its burrow. Half-decayed leaves, petioles, 
peduncles, and decayed flowers are likewise swallowed and the nutriment they 
contain likewise assimilated. The leaves are drawn into the mouth of the burrow 
and are moistened with a sort of saliva, which acts on the fresh leaves in a 
remarkable manner, changing the green color of the chlorophyll-bearing cells to a 
brown. The saliva is the same as the pancreatic secretion of the higher animals.! 
It operates with an alkaline reaction and converts vegetable cellulose into soluble 
carbohydrates and is, in fact, a ferment. The calciferous glands excrete lime. 
Farmer and gardener are apt to be deadly enemies of this harmless little animal.

It was thought that it feeds upon the tender roots of plants. Upon this point 
the testimony collected experimentally by Wollny may be cited.! 
1. In no one of my experiments have the plants suffered the slightest injury. 
2. Other things being equal, the soil filled with worms was very noticeably more 
fertile than those free from worms. 
8. The pulverization of the soil by the work of the worms lessened its capacity 
to hold water and increased the amount of air beneath its surface. 
4, The work of the worms favorably altered the mechanical properties of the 
soil by making it more porous. . 
- Hensen having stated that the burrows made by worms were the paths of the 
roots of plants, experiments were undertaken by Mr. Méhured Djémil, of the exper- 
iment station of the University of Halle, to test his conclusion. The experiments 
appear to demonstrate the error of this incautious remark of Mr. von Hensen, as 
may be supposed on examining the illustration of the root given above. But the 
results obtained by the experimenter and tabulated by him are far more interest- 
ing in other particulars. 
Eighteen tubes or pots being selected, each 40 inches deep and 8 inches wide, 
they were separated into two sets. In one set worms were to be placed, in the 
other no worms were to be admitted. Into three pots of each set were then placed 
a similar soil, ‘‘ sandy clay;” into three more pots of each set was placed a similar 
soil, ‘‘stiff clay,” and into the remaining three pots of each set was placeda 
‘clayey sand.” The soils were air-dried, sieved, and then dried at a temperature 
of 212° F. The results were as follows for the leguminous plants (those for pota- 
toes, beets, and vetch practically are the same and are not given):

THE ACTINIC ACTION OF THE SUN RAY. 
The value of water to vegetation in any form and of humus to vegetation in its 
higher or mammalian-nourishing forms has been noted. It remains to speak of 
light and heat, without which water is as sterile as a rock, if not, indeed, a rock 
when the thermometer is below 32° F.. Theicebergs that endanger the navigation 
of the North Atlantic carry neither palms nor lichens. 
Weshall consider the solar rays to present three activities, a light-making, a heat- 
giving, and a chemical-acting activity, which, though bound together like tho 
strands of a rope, are yet separable in their effects. Plants breathe day and night,

put it is only in the light of the sun that their leaves disengage oxygen and assim- 
ilate carbon, which, as far as is known, is a chemical process. Attention will 
therefore be given to the chemical or ‘‘actinic” constitution of the atmosphere; 
in other words, the action of the actinic strand so to speak of the rays of the sun 
after they have entered our atmosphere. 
If it were possible to follow our atmosphere upward until it edges off to extinc- 
tion or where what there is of it is, as is said in the infinitesimal calculus, less 
than any assignable quantity, it would be found to be an atmosphere within an 
atmosphere, as the Gulf Stream is a body of water within another body of water. 
It is perfectly well known that a ‘‘perfect vacuum” in a tube will not pass elec- 
tricity,' yet it is equally certain that there is at least a connection between the 
sun and terrestrial electric currents as those currents operate upon the surface of 
the earth, as the following incident will show: On August 3, 1872, Professor 
Young,’ while observing at Sherman in the Rocky Mountains, saw three notable 
paroxysms in the sun’s chromosphere or colored part of its atmosphere. Jets of 
luminous matter of intense brilliancy were projected at 8.45, 10.30, and 11,50 
a.m., local time. The photographer of the party who was making the magnetic 
observations told Professor Young that he had been obliged to give up work as 
the magnetic needle had been ‘‘swung clear off the limb.” Now, at Greenwich, 
in England, in addition to taking a daily photograph of the sun, they have in 
their cellar an apparatus which traces the fluctuations of the daily “‘magnetic ver- 
tical force.” To the astronomer royal at that institution Professor Young imme- 
diately wrote, and, correction for the difference in time being made, here isthe reply: 
  
  Greenwich Observatory (England) magnetic observations on August 8, 1872. The tremulous 
line is made by a magnetic needle carrying a small mirror, whence a spot of light is reflected 
upon a strip of photographic paper, kept continually rolling before it by clockwork. If the 
needle is still, there will be a straight line on the paper. If the needle shivers, the light spot 
vibrates with the motion and the line becomes sinuous or more and more sharply zigzaged as it 
trembles in the grip of the unknown force which it obeys. [The illustration and incident are 
given by Professor Langley in his New Astronomy. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.]

Although Professor Crookes could not send a current of electricity from one end 
of a glass tube which had been exhausted of all its atmospheric air to the other end, 
he found he could do wonderful things by discharging acurrent from the negative 
or cathode pole of an electric battery into a tube in which the air had been so far 
exhausted that it exerted a pressure of only one one-millionth of an atmosphere, 
the pressure of 1 atmosphere being capable of holding up a column of mercury 
80 inches above the font or basin of mercury at the bottom of the column. He 
found that the stuff remaining in the tube struck out in a straight line, from which 
it could not be made to deviate any more than the force of gravity which strikes 
for the center of the earth can be made to deviate. He found that even a sun- 
beam acting on a pith ball striped longitudinally white and black and suspended 
in such a vacuum would make the ball revolve with such rapidity as to jeopardize 
the safety of his delicate apparatus, just as the world, or, rather, its atmosphere, 
might be supposed to be made to spin by sunbeams, were it a pith ball in space, if 
it could be alternately striped from pole to pole with ‘light and shade.” But 
when Mr. Crookes let more and more atmosphere into his apparatus he found the 
greenish phosphorescence change to purplish, that is to say, bluish, and that the 
current from the negative or cathode pole flowed to the positive or anode pole, as 
that was moved around, and could be deflected by a magnet.! ‘‘Could we float,” 
says Professor Langley, ‘‘upon the uppermost layer of our atmosphere, the sun 
would appear to the spectator as bluish.”? Possibly he might say, something on 
the order of the cold, cheerless blue of the hissing electric street lamp. But what 
these remarks are particularly designed to introduce and emphasize is the pene- 
trating and dissociating or chemical effects of solar emanations, whether they be 
called sunbeams, radiant light, radiant matter, or X-rays. 
The progress made by science, says M. Duclaux, professor of physics in the 
Agricultural University of France, leads us more and more to attribute to chem- 
ical rays a special action which is different from and, to a certain extent, inde- 
pendent of that of the heat and light rays, for they seem when passing through 
our atmosphere to obey laws peculiar to themselves. Landscape photographers 
well know that days equally warm or days equally luminous do not give the same 
chemical effects, and in northern lands, where vegetation is well known to be 
specially susceptible to the power of the chemical rays, growth proceeds more 
rapidly than in temperate regions, notwithstanding the fainter light and the lower 
temperature. To what are these differences due?* 
To answer this question the thermometer will not suffice. That instrument, as its 
mercury rises, tells only that the mercury has become lighter, as all bodies appear 
to do when heated.‘ So Professor Duclaux selected a body which, being an organic 
body, is more or less dissipated by the action of the light, from association with 
the illuminating power of which, indeed, he found it impossible to separate the 
special chemical function of the sunbeam. This actinic measure was oxalic acid, 
easily formed from cellulose by heating with nitric acid. Two or 3 grams of the 
crystals of this acid are dissolved in 1} pints of water. In the proportion that the 
acid contents of this solution disappear, as determined by acidimetric measure- 
ments, the actinic or chemical effect of the atmosphere is told off, for M. Duclaux 
distinctly states ‘‘that neither the solar heat nor the heat produced in the

formation of carbonic acid [from the destruction of the oxalic acid] has any per- 
ceptible effect upon the solution as an index of the chemical action of the sunbeam, 
though on fine days half of the oxalic acid may be dissipated.” 
Now, in the first place, it will be found that the chemical changes produced in 
the oxalic-acid solution are influenced by the strength or amount of this acid dis- 
solved in the water, by the depth of the vessel used to hold the solution, and the 
length of the exposure. 
(a) The effect of the strength of the solution is shown by this experiment: !

As the cylindrical or “test” tube was put in the shallow, broad-bottomed 
vessel to secure uniformity of temperature, the result is at least accurate for 
those two in comparison. 
(c) The effect of duration of exposure is shown by the following experiments 
performed on ‘‘ Mont Dore,” September 6, 1888, 8.30 a, m.: Four like vessels were 
exposed to the sun, and at the intervals stated below a vessel was withdrawn and 
the acid burned measured:

Observe the time lost in starting, but especially the rapidity of combustion from 
12.30 to 4.30 p.m. Observe also that notwithstanding the lowness of the sun at 
6 and 7 o’clock in September how fast the acid was burnt. ‘‘Itis always so,” says 
M. Duclaux, ‘‘ whether the transformation of the oxalic acid be slow, as on Mont 
Dore, or quick, as I have sometimes found it at Paris.” Butthisis not all. An 
exposure for one day of a vessel will render its oxalic acid contents more readily 
consumable the next than the contents of a vessel exposed for the first time. For 
instance, four vessels being prepared and exposed, two were examined at the close 
of the first day, and the amount of oxalic acid burned was carefully noted. The

In speaking of these matters in the present connection it must not be supposed 
that Professor Duclaux announced them as facts bearing upon agricultural chem- 
istry or that he intended to present any analogy in discussing the conduct of oxalic 
acid, which occurs in almost every plant, under the action of the sunbeam, to the 
action of the sunbeam upon the union of nitric acid sent up by the roots to the 
leaf and the cellulose within the leaf when the leaf is sunlit. Professor Duclaux’s 
tests of his apparatus nevertheless show how the organic acids in the leaf may be 
varyingly affected by the sunbeam, one day this way, another that; but as this 
is not exactly what he intends to prove by his apparatus, we may turn, in justice 
to him, to his demonstration of the fact that chemical effects of the sunbeam are 
independent of thermal effects thereof and are therefore not measurable by meteo- 
rological implements. ‘The principal lesson of my memoir,” he says, “is that 
the actinic force of the day is not the same for the same day in different parts of 
the globe, and its effect increases more rapidly than the duration of illumination 
increases,” 
First, why does vegetation progress more rapidly in northern lands than in 
France? To Professor Elfving, at the University of Helsingfors, latitude 60° 10’, 
where the day is fourteen hours long in September, and the sun 88° above the 
horizon at noon, was sent an oxalic solution and ten vessels exactly like those 
Mr. Duclaux was using in France. On five days the following observations were 
made:!

Nore By Mr. Ervine: The difference between the first three days of 1887 and the two 
others of that year is great. It probably arises from the fact that the atmosphere was washed 
out by heavy rains on August 30 and September land 2. I observed this effect of rain in March 
last. [The difference between the two years on the two September daysisnot explained. Both 
those days in 1888 had a “ very clear sky.”

together by the writer of this chapter, and M. Duclaux is in no way responsible for the combi- 
nation if an improper one to make.

M. Duclaux comments on these remarkable facts in these words: *‘ What 
strikes us in reading these figures is their smallness, even on fine days. They are 
the smallest I have ever had to record in August and September for somany 
times. Yet September was fine at Mont Dore in 1888. Butis it not noticeable 
how the character of the day and its actinic value do not square? Thus the very 
fine day of September 15 gave only a combustion of 9 per cent, while the slightly 
veiled day of September 28 gave a combustion of 49 per cent. This confirms my 
contention that we have missed our way in considering the chemical action of 
solar light as independent of locality and proportionate to time of exposure or as 
measured by meteorological instruments.”

Those who have read Mr. Du Chaillu’s Land of the Midnight Sun will not 
require any particular description of that romantic country or its people. It will 
suffice to say that for about one hundred and eighty-six days, during the summer 
period north of the equator, day and night are not so characterized by light and 
darkness as in more southern climes. The earth leans over toward the sun and 
the arctic pole points in such a way that the sun’s rays are constantly striking 
the earth behind it, though for the remainder of the year the sun’s rays never 
hit the pole at all. It was Sir David Brewster that showed the effect of this on the 
arctic atmospheric illumination and accounted for its redness. Mr. Lockyer, in 
illustrating this fact, remarks: ‘‘One form of aqueous vapor in our atmosphere 
exerts a powerful obliterating action on the solar light, commencing at the blue 
end of the spectrum and gradually creeping toward the other or red end.”! But 
here is his diagram of Brewster’s theory: 
      Atmosphere through which sunbeams 
have to penetrate at different hour 2 
For the purpose now in hand it is necessary to arrange this diagram a little dif- 
ferently, reconstructing it so as to show the increasing thickness of the atmos- 
phere through which the sun rays must penetrate in order to reach the arctic sur- 
face of the globe. Then the diagram will have this form for June 21 for some 
thousands of years yet, by which time the south pole will have gradually acquired 
the one hundred and eighty-six days of ex- 
posure to the sun now enjoyed by the 
north. If, however, we consider the sun- 
beam as striking the convex surface of the 
exterior of the atmospheric envelope of the 
earth, then the diagram would have to be 
again changed; for the atmosphere of the 
earth, being denser than the ‘‘void” of 
space, would act like a convex lens and 
focus the rays—let us say for convenience, 
at the center of the earth—as those rays 
came out of the ‘‘void.” Rearranging the 
original Lockyer diagram to correspond 
with this suggestion of physics, we have 
a conception in which the course of the 
sun’s rays through the artic atmosphere 
is shorter than in our preceding diagram; 
but they are refracted or bent and the 
value of the sunbeam is proportional to the angle and the manipulation given it 
by the atmosphere; that is to say, its ‘‘refraction” and its “dispersion ” into its 
elements, that is,if any dispersion occurs at all.?

2 Hankel is quoted by Professor Goodale (who in his Botany brings together the chief charac- 
teristics of the investigations up to 1885 and points out that while the spectrum absorption of 
chlorophyll shows up for the chemical or blue end of the prism-divided sun ray, direct experi- 
mentation is equally positive for the red end) to the effect that “‘the angle at which a beam of 
light strikes a plate of g! makes a noticeable difference in the amount of chemical rays which 
can pass through it. Thus, while at a vertical angle 81 per cent of such rays are transmitted, the 
rest being absorbed, at an angle of 60 degrees the amount transmitted is reduced to 71 per cent 
and at 80 degrees to 33 per cent.”

There is in France an experiment station of a peculiar kind. Itis called a sta- 
tion of agricultural climatology, and its object is to study experimentally the 
effect of sunbeams on vegetable life. Its director is the well-known astronomical 
writer, Camille Flammarion. Some singular results, though not new, have been 
proved at that establishment. It seems that if there is anything in the atmosphere 
that may cause the sun rays to tinge more toward the red of the spectrum, the

so to speak, of a sensitive plant to the highest pitch, while under blue effects the 
sensitiveness and the growth are reduced toa minimum. Here is the way four

And here are the plants—not, indeed, the four mimosas, but four lettuce plants,

In these experiments only plants grown under white or red glass have borne 
fruit, and that the red glass grown fruit can not compare with that of the white 
glass. It is suggested that the most important part of this experiment is the defi-

THH ROTHAMSTED EXPERIMENT STATION. 
Rothamsted is a country place in Hertfordshire, 25 miles from London. Soon 
after coming into possession of the place Sir John Bennet Lawes began experi- 
menting, at first in flower pots and then in the open field, and the researches of 
Saussure on vegetation were the chief subject of his study to his end. Of all the 
experiments made about 1834 those in which the neutral phosphate of lime was 
rendered soluble by means of sulphuric acid and the mixture applied for root 
crops gave the most striking results. In 1843 more systematic field experiments 
were commenced and the experimental station founded. The continuation of 
these experiments is insured by the gift of $500,000, the laboratory, and certain 
areas of land by Sir John. In 1889 trustees were appointed and a committee of 
management selected. The trustees aro Sir John Lubbock, F. R. §., Lord Wal- 
singham, F. R. S., Sir John Evans, K. C. B., treasurer of the Royal Society. The 
committee consists of nine members, four from the Royal Society, one from the  
-P-A-G-E-1036
  956 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Chemical Society, one from the Linnean Society, two from the Royal Agricultural 
Society, and Sir John himself. Up to the present Sir J. Henry Gilbert has been 
associated with the founder in the conduct of the experiments for a period of fifty- 
four years. At first an old barn was used for a laboratory, but a laboratory was 
subsequently built by public subscription of agriculturists and presented to the 
founder in 1855. The staff has been one, two, and sometimes three chemists, two 
or three general assistants, a botanical assistant occasionally, two or three com- 
puters and record keepers, and a laboratory man and other help as occasion 
required. 
There are now more than 40,000 bottles of experimenta_ly grown vegetable prod- 
uce, of annual products, of ashes, or of soils, besides some thousands of samples 
not in bottles. Nothing has been done at Rothamsted in the way of manure- 
feeding-stuff or seed-control. 
The investigations have covered three inquiries, (1) agricultural vegetation, (2) 
agricultural characteristics of soil, and (3) manure as affected by the food and 
condition of live stock.

  Agricultural vegetation.—For forty-two years experiments have been made in 
the park on the mixed herbage of permanent grass land. The plots vary from an 
eighth to half an acre, the whole area being7 acres. The results to be watched 
for were pointed by the following considerations: 
Assume a grass field. Its vegetable population is not uniform, but is as mixed 
as the human population of a Western State that has felt the full tide of a varied 
European and American colonization. The true grass family, the bean family, 
the composit family, and others, have representatives all struggling for exist- 
ence. Now, it was known that wheat, oats, timothy, and other grain plants, or 
true botanical grasses, agree among themselves in demanding the same kind of 
manure. It was also known that plants of the bean and clover order—legumi- 
nose, as they are called—vary widely as to their demands, while crops of other
-P-A-G-E-1037
  
AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 95% 
families—root crops (the crucifere, or mustard family), potatoes (belonging to 
the deadly nightshade or belladonna family, called solanacez), and others exhibit 
characteristics differing both from the grain-like or true grasses and still more 
from the bean and clover like plants of the great leguminosz family, which is, 
next to the composite or sunflower-like family which is so largely made of 
weeds, the largest family of the vegetable kingdom. Now, which of this mixture 
of vegetable population is to be encouraged ? 
In the first place we have the popular artificial manures—nitrates, phosphates, 
and the alkali, potash—and next the manure of the farmyard. With these let us 
experiment to get the fifty families of the Rothamsted field to yield the agricul- 
tural product called hay in its best alimentary form. ist., two unmanured plots, in 
all half an acre, show that seventeen true grasses, four leguminous plants, and the 
representatives of twenty-seven or more other families contribute to every 100 
pounds of hay the following proportion:

2d. Farmyard manure reduced the number of contributors to the hay permitted 
py the unmanured half acre, raised the contribution by weight of the true grasses; 
but lowered that of both the legumines and the other families. 3d. In order to 
illustrate the effect of the nitrogenous and other ‘‘mineral” manures applied in 
excessive doses for many successive years, it may be said, to take an extreme case, 
that the legumines have been completely poisoned or crowded out, and the other 
families nearly so, while about a dozen grasses have contributed from 95 to 98 per 
cent of the hay. The philosophy of this result is simple enough; any manure that 
favors an individual family or species of a family ruins natural competition, 
Nitrate of soda, or, better, equal parts of sulphate and muriate of ammonia (all 
nitrogenous manures), makes the true grasses luxuriant, but the beans and 
clovers which we have found getting nitrogen from the air are pushed to the 
wall by dosings of nitrogenous manures. ‘Purely mineral manures, supplying 
an abundance of potash and phosphoric acid, though reducing somewhat the num- 
ber of the competing families, do not increase the luxuriance, though they favor 
the stemminess of maturation of the grasses, but reduce the percentage by weight 
of such herbage in the hay.” But while the potash and phosphatic manures act 
thus on the true grasses that the nitrates nourish, they increase the luxuriance 
of the legumines and the weight thereof in the hay, while reducing the number of 
the miscellaneous competing families and their product. To close out this para- 
graph let us say, perhaps too dogmatically: Nitrogen makes grain-grass hay; 
phosphorus and potash, bean or clover grass hay, and farmyard manure, as we 
shall see in the next paragraph, makes hay. , 
Variety of vegetation adds great value to permanent grass land. Unma- 
nured land produces 1 ton of first-crop hay to the acre having the most varied 
ingredients; potash will yield about one-half more of much less variety but con- 
siderably filled with leguminous plants, in fact, it produces the best mineral 
manure hay; but ‘‘ mineral and nitrogenous manures together ” run the yield up to 
thrice the amount of unmanured land, yet of the 95 to 98 per cent of the 3 tons of 
first-crop grain-family grass it produces 90 per cent is made up of four to six of 
the most freely growing and coarser species, characterized by great stemminess. 
To put the matter statistically, a horse would take into his stomach in eating 
the produce of an acre of unmanured pasture 7} pounds of phosphoric acid, 25 
pounds of potash, and 30 pounds of nitrogen; in eating the produce of an acre of 
potash-dosed land, he would deposit in his stomach 18 pounds of phosphoric acid, 
75 pounds of potash, and 50 pounds of nitrogen; while in consuming the 3 tons  
-P-A-G-E-1038
  958 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97: 
produced by the potash-phosphate-nitrogenated field he would have placed at the 
disposal of his alimentary system some 30 pounds of phosphoric acid, 145 pounds of 
potash, and 108 pounds of nitrogen contained in that ‘‘very coarse, stemmy hay.” 
“The general result has been,” says Sir J. Henry Gilbert in his last annual report 
(1897), ‘‘to show that if artificial manures are largely or mainly relied upon cer- 
tain descriptions of herbage will be unduly forced at the expense of others, and 
also the character of development of the plants will be materially affected. In 
order to maintain a due admixture of herbage on grass land mown for hay, farm- 
yard or stable dung should be liberally applied; and it is also conducive to the 
same end to consume the second crop on the land with cake or corn. The more 
a good condition of the herbage is induced and maintained by such means, the 
more safely may some increased luxuriance, and therefore increased produce, be 
obtained by the judicious use of artificial manures. Provided dung be liberally 
used, it will not as a rule be necessary to apply potash artificially; but phosphates 
may be used advantageously in the form of basic (blast furnace?) slag and a nitroge- 
nous manure in the form of nitrate of soda, which, however, should seldom be 
used at the rate of more than 1 hundredweight or at most 14 hundredweights per 
acre.” ‘‘Away from the Alpine pastures the blood of our stock can never be long 
maintained by foreign breeders,” says the Swiss breeder, Wattenwyl. Let us pass 
to the experiments in the Broadwalk field (see map) on wheat. 
For more than fifty years in succession wheat has been grown in the Broadwalk 
Field without manure, with farmyard manure, with various artificial manures. 
The period of the test is truly long and the results are surprising, Wheat may be 
grown for many years in succession on ordinary arable land (a little over an acre 
in all) without manure, so as to yield ‘‘nearly 13 bushels to the acre, or more than 
the average of the whole of the United States of America, including their rich 
prairie lands.” But this statement must be accepted with caution. In the first 
place, the land was ‘‘ kept clean,” a very important consideration indeed; and in 
the second place, the climate of England may be a “ wheat” climate, while the 
climate of the United States may be a ‘‘corn” climate. In the rice region of 
China wheat does not:yield as heavily as in thenorth, where its culture is charac- 
teristic. Above the Yangtse Kiang, roughly speaking, it is not uncommon to get 
64 bushels of wheat from an acre, below not more than 82 bushels.! But the 
Broadwalk field shows still other results. ‘* Unlike leguminous crops, such as 
beans and clover, wheat may be successfully grown for many years in succession 
on ordinary arable land, provided suitable manures be applied and the land be kept 
clean.” But mineral manures (phosphates, potash, etc.) alone will not do it, as 
Messrs. Liebig and Ville contended, nor nitrogenous manures alone, though they 
are more valuable than mineral manures alone; by combining them, however, a 
very much increased yield was given. In one case the product yielded by mixed 
mineral and nitrogenous manures was more than that by the annual application of 
farmyard manure of 14 tons to the acre. The inquiry naturally suggests itself, 
Was Liebig correct in speaking of the farmer who was to contract to supply to 
nature so many pounds of potash, so many of soluble phosphates, and so on, if she 
would promise to repay him usurious interest for his carting of foreign minerals 
upon hissoil? As far as the exhaustion of unmanured soil goes, perhaps he was. It 
is estimated at Rothamsted that in the forty years elapsing from.1852 to 1891 
there was an average reduction of the yield of a half an acre plot equal to one- 
  
1The language used by M. Simon, in his La Cité Chinoise, p. 367, is this: Two or three days 
after the disposal of the fourth crop by turning it under a second working of the soil was made 
and then the fifth crop was planted in. This consisted of planting 7 meous (meou =a sixth of

In passing to consider the experiments in rotation in the Agdell field, it is perti- 
nent to inquire what is the precise profit in growing straw and light wheat with 
mixed mineral manures. 
There was a time when the panacea offered by science to agricultural distress 
was rotation in crops. It rested the land, it was said. There should be no more 
valuable contribution to agricultural practice than to ascertain the relative mer- 
its of the two or more fold course of rotation in keeping the land in good heart. 
At Rothamsted the four-course rotation was chosen—turnips, barley, beans (or 
fallow), and wheat—for the test which began in 1848. The results are important. 
They show that wheat, the staff of human life, possesses extraordinary agricultural . 
vitality, but that root crops are a highly artificial product, possessing no agricul- 
tural stamina whatever, and will quickly revert to their lean and fibrous condi- 
tion in nature if the soil in which they are grown is not constantly dosed with 
drugs or manure. 
The Swedish turnips commenced the course on three plats, each of an acre; one 
constantly left unmanured, another treated to superphosphate of lime, the third 
treated with complex mineral and nitrogenous manures. The three plats were 
each divided into two, and upon one half the turnips were either fed to sheep 
or cut up and plowed under. A leguminous crop was sown upon each of these 
halves, but the other half was put to fallow. As this is somewhat confusing, the 
diagram is introduced. Thus, in the lowest rectangle @ no manure was given 
to the plants, the root crop and foliage were carted away, and after barley, the 
second crop in each course of rotation, were planted beans or clover. On the 
other hand, in rectangle b exactly the same things were done, except that instead 
of planting beans or clover after barley, the plat was fallowed. But in rectangle 
¢ the first rotation crop (i. e., turnips) was fed upon the ground or cut up and 
plowed under, and the fallow followed the barley, while in rectangle d the root 
crop was fed as in c, but barley was followed by beans or clover. An analysis of

the results of the four unmanured rectangles is put into the form given in the foot 
note.! But far more interesting are the comments of Sir John Gilbert: ‘‘When

bly more with the mineral and nitrogenous manures, when it was grown in 
rotation than when grown continuously year in and year out on the same soil.” 
Taking the quantities of stuff produced by the barley and wheat in the rotation, 
it appears that each produced considerably more than either of the so-called restor- 
ative crops, that is, the roots, or the beans, or clover, but the supply of nitro- 
gen within the soil placed within the reach of the wheat is increased by both the 
leguminous crops, but especially clover, and the fallow. Clover being thus con- 
firmed as a restorative, or, as it was once called, an ameliorating crop, the experi- 
ments on clovers and other leguminous plants in ‘‘ Hoos field” and ‘“ Geescroft 
field” require attention. 
The experiments at Rothamsted upon clover are far from conclusive. Flower- 
pot experiments, and a patch of garden soil tell one tale, the Hoos and Geescroft 
fields another. Experiments were made in Hoos field on the growth of various 
leguminous crops year after year on the same land with mineral, and with mineral 
and nitrogenous manures, commencing in 1848-49, Red clover seed was sown 
twelve times in twenty-nine years, and the plant failed eight times out of the last 
ten trials. ‘The results showed that when red clover was thus sown frequently on 
the same land, there was almost uniform failure. In fact, after the first few years 
practically no crop was obtained. In 1878, after the cessation of the trials with red 
clover, various other leguminous plants of different habits of growth, and especially 
of different character and range of roots, were sown on the (so to speak) clover-sick 
land. The result was that whilst red clover, which was included in the list of the 
new experiments, still failed, giving an average of only 22 pounds of nitrogen per 
acre per annum in five years of crop over seven years, the more weakly rooted and. 
more weakly growing white clover, which had not been grown on the land for many 
years, gave an average of 47 pounds in six years of crop over nine years; the more 
freely growing and deeper-rooting vetch, an average of 75 pounds over fourteen 
years; Bokhara clover, 64 pounds per annum in eleven years of crop over twelve 
years; and the very deeply and very powerfully rooting lucerne an average of 160 
pounds of nitrogen over twelve years. Here, then, when various other legumi- 
nous plants followed on the red-clover-exhausted land, they grew luxuriantly, and 
yielded much larger, and in some cases very large, amounts of nitrogen. Further, 
the surface soils gained rather than lost nitrogen. 
‘‘Experiments have also been made with leguminous crops in Geescroft field. 
Thus, beans were grown year after year on the same land, without manure, with 
mineral manures, and with mineral and nitrogenous manures, commencing in 1847. 
The results showed considerable increase in the produce, and coincidently in the 
yield of nitrogen, by the use of mineral manures containing potash, though but 
little further increase by the addition of nitrogenous manures; notwithstanding 
that beans, like other leguminous crops, contain a much higher percentage of 
nitrogen and yield much more nitrogen per acre than grain crops. Further, by 
the growth of beans thus year after year on the same land, the amount of prod- 
uce and the yield of nitrogen declined considerably, both being much less under 
all conditions of manuring in the later than in the earlier years. The results 
were confirmatory. As in the case of the growth of various other leguminous 
crops on the clover-exhausted land (in Hoos field), so now [in the Geescroft field] 
after the failure of the beans and decline in the yield of nitrogen in them, on 
sowing red clover, with its very different character and range of roots, on the 
bean-exhausted land, very large crops of clover, containing very large amounts 
of nitrogen, were obtained. Notwithstanding so much nitrogen was removed 
in the clover crops, the surface soil became determinably richer in nitrogen, due 
to accumulation of nitrogenous crop residue.” 
In spite of these facts, clover has been grown continuously for forty consecutive 
years on rich garden soil, though the plant showed ‘‘a much reduced persistence,

a considerably reduced amount of produce and of nitrogen, and with this a con- 
siderable reduction of the stock of nitrogen in the soil.” 
Rain and drainage.—The experiment stations of the United States, it may be 
supposed, have won their great achievements in the sphere of the destruction of 
noxious insects, the effects of animal food stuffs when taken into the stomach, and 
sampling fertilizers. 
But they have also obtained some solid results in the line of soil physics, not to 
call it by its Gallic name of agrostology, a less practical question, no doubt, but 
still useful for the advancement of the science of agriculture, especially in the 
West. At Rothamsted the rainfall has been measured from the beginning, just 
as at Paris they have collected the rain falling every day for two hundred years.' 
But it has only been since 1877, that is, for the last twenty years, that the work 
has been wide enough to be of scientific value. The heads of inquiry are now 
Rainfall,” ‘‘ Drainage,” and ‘‘ Loss of nitrogen per acre in drainage.” The appa- 
#itus whereby this is effected is shown in the pictures,

“5-inch funnel.” The 0.00l-acre gauge shows that the funnel gaugo falls short about 1 inch. 
The year 1891 in Nebraskaappearsto have been exceptionally moist and favorable to crops, while 
1894 seems to have been greatly deficient in rain and yield, according to the weekly statements of

acre per annum reckoned as nitrogen, corresponding to an average annual loss of 
nearly 2 hundredweights of nitrate of soda. 
“With reference to the large amounts of loss of nitrogen by drainage thus 
indicated, it is to be borne in mind that probably not more than an average of about 
5 pounds would be contributed annually per acre from the atmosphere in rain and 
the minor aqueous deposits, exclusive of any condensation by the soil. Moreover, 
the soil of the drain gauges had been unmanured since 1868; but, being exposed 
to the access of air from below as well as from above, the oxidation of the nitrog- 
enous matters of the soil and subsoil may be more active than in similar soil in 
its natural [not underdrained] condition. On the other hand, the soil was without 
any vegetation to arrest the nitric acid formed, whilst in some cases of fallow land 
which had been manured and cropped in the ordinary course, and which would 
therefore be in a much higher ‘condition’ than the soil of the drain gauges, as 
much or even more nitrogen as nitric acid has been found to be present in the 
autumn to the depth of 18 or 27 inches.” 
THE LIFE-PROCESS AND INSTINCT OF THE PLANT. 
In the former part of these remarks we have spoken first of hypothesis and then 
of observational experimentation in agriculture. It is now proposed to speak of 
the agricultural plant, a subject which in agricultural courses of instruction is 
considered to be “botany.” The knowledge of the origin of cultivated plants is 
interesting to agriculturists, to botanists, and even to historians and philosophers 
concerned with the dawnings of civilization, says Mr. de Candolle, and for such 
of them as desire to consult the literary record of agricultural vegetation that 
author’s work is by far the best compilation. For those who seek to know why 
men have cabbages to eat instead of lichens and sweet potatoes instead of the 
swelled roots of some other form of the morning glory family the works of Mr. 
Darwin and others on the behavior of plants under domestication are necessary. 
Why the native Hindoo soldiers at the siege of Arcot could truthfully say to Clive 
that the boiled rice should be given to the English soldier, as the water in which 
it had been boiled would be nourishment in their stomachs,! can not be spoken of 
in this connection, for we are here concerned with the vital principle of the plant 
and its ability to care for itself, not with the digestive apparatus of the animal 
that eats the plant. 
The plant sprouts, feeds itself from the air, and reproduces itself in growing, 
but all these activities are not primarily the work of the plant, but in particular 
of certain of its units. It is warrantable to say that the vitality of a plant is the 
sum of the vitality of its cells, modified, indeed, by the coordination of those cells 
to obtain nourishment freely and abundantly and the ability to use the energy 
elaborated from the nourishment thus obtained. Three theories of cell formation 
confront, not to say dismay, the inquirer. One turns upon the survival of the fit- 
test, and each ‘physiological cell” or unit of the individual has the power of 
arranging itself into a special form (Spencer’) or to say the same thing differ- 
1 Macaulay’s Life of Clive. 
2 Inhis argument in Principles of Biology (vol.1,p. 182) Mr. Spencer makes these observations: 
“Tt can not be that the atoms of albumen or fibrin or gelatine or the hypothetical protein sub- 
stance—the chemical units, so to speak—possess the power of arranging themselves into a spe- 
cial form, which I shall call polarity. Nor can such power reside in the mere cell form or mor- 
phological units, since the formation of a cell is to some extent a manifestation of the power. If, 
then, this organic power of arrangement into a special form is possessed neither by the chemi- 
cal units nor the morphological units, we must conceive it to be possessed by certain intermedi- 
ate units, which we may term physiological units.” Again,in connection with heredity, he says: 
“Throughout the process of evolution two kind of units, mainly agreeing in the form in which 
they intend to build themselves, but having minor differences, work in unison to produce an 
organism of the species from which they are derived, but work in antagonism to produce copies 
of their respective parents.”

ently there are ‘‘gemmules” in each cell which flow to the sexual parts of the 
individual and strive concurrently, but perhaps not always harmoniously, to con- 
centrate their energies to bring about the highest development of the individual’s 
offspring (Darwin'). The second theory is based on logic, or ‘‘the formal laws of 
thought,” and not 
on evolution in 
the Darwinian 
sense of that 
term, for it con-

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE CELL IN THE OVIARY. eA 
Such are the hypotheses concerning the modus operandi by which new beings 
are created. The physical or visual facts in the case may be exposed as follows : 
Let it be supposed that the dust called pollen has been emitted by the male 
organ of a flower, that is, by an anther, and a grain of that dust has been caught by 
the appropriate female organ, called the stigma, of a distant plant. Let it be fur- 
ther supposed that the pollen grain is roundish, like the spores of Aspergillus 
niger, mentioned on page 933. In a few minutes or hours that grain, being 
nourished by the sticky, viscid matter of the stigma, sprouts not upward into the 
air, like the Aspergillus, but downward away from the open air, like an anzrobe, 
as shown in the illustration in the margin. The pollen is alive, for it has pushed 
a tube down into the ovary. The stigma is alive also, for it has secreted the 
juices that have nourished the pollen grain and helped along its penetration into 
the interior of the ‘‘pistil.” We are, then, to look upon this growth of the pollen 
1Jt is universally admitted that the cells or units of the body increase by self-division. But 
besides this means of increase I assume that the units throw off minute granules, which are dis- 
persed throughout the whole system; that these, when supplied with proper nourishment, mul- 
tiply by self-division and are ultimately developed into units like those from which they were 
originally derived. ‘These granules may be called gemmules, and are collected from all parts of 
the system to constitute the sexual elements, and their development in the next generation 
forms a new being. They are not the physiological units of Mr. Herbert Spencer. This provi- 
sional hypothesis I call pangenésis [Animals and Plants Under Domestication, pp. 869-870].

grain as we have looked upon that of the Aspergillus. spore, for the juices of the 
stigma are the ‘‘plasma” of the pollen. Thus antecedent to the fecundation 
there is a microbous growth, which sets up interior disarrangements, as will be 
shown, which eventually result after fecundation in the formation of a miniature 
plant. The strange thing about the matter is that the little plant may, when 
grown up, turn out to be greatly different from either the plant from which the 
pollen drifted or from the plant which caught and nourished the pollen on its 
stigma and then received the ‘“‘ being” of the pollen in its ovary.

PREPARATION FOR FECUNDATION. 
In showing how the ovule or mother part of the plant prepares for the act of 
impregnation two things require particular attention. These are the development 
of the mother cell and the embryo sac, or embryonic egg proper, which transforms 
the contents of the sac into a miniature plant surrounded by food—that is, into a 
seed. But first, a moment’s consideration of the development of the flower. For

this let us take a member of the milkweed family,' the shallow-wort, vince toxi- 
cum. The flower begins somewhat as shown in fig.8. The undefined part contin- 
ues to develop in the horn-like way in which the sepals started out, and ata ‘‘fifth 
stage” the flower shows the space that nature leaves for an interior growth, marked 
fin fig. 4. In the sixth stage all the future exterior or atmospheric parts of the 
flower have been formed, and for the present purpose the other ‘‘stage” of growth 
in fig. 6 will finish this introduction to the genesis of an embryo sac and its inval- 
uable contents. We are now to consider what takes place in one of those little 
ovules of which two sets are shown back to back, using, however, another plant.

A short time before the floral organs of the aster, a member of the great com- 
positae family, attain their maximum length there appears at the bottom of the 
ovarian cavity a rounded excrescence. This is the incipient ovule, the promise of 
afuture seed.” At first the ovule is a mere mass of soft cellular substance like 
the interior of any young portion of a growing stem, but as it curves around and 
becomes turned up side down, as shown in the illustration of an ‘‘anatropic” 
ovule given above, a new kind of cell appears at the turning end of the ovule, 
which, surrounded by a single layer of ordinary cells, thrusts itself out from the 
main body. This is called the ‘‘mother cell” (figs. 8 and 9). The proceedings of

  this cell in expectation of the arrival of the pollen, as shown in Professor Gray’s 
picture of buckwheat (fig.2), will now require attention. 
There is a question as to whether the wall or inclosure of the mother cell is 
immediately turned into an embryo sac or whether the sac is a product of the 
operations of its very peculiar contents. In the aster the mother cell proceeds to 
divide itself into three other cells upward and back of itself, then to reabsorb those 
three above it, and finally to consume the row of cells which cover it as it juts out 
from the body of the ovule like a peninsula, as shown at an early stage at b in

fig. 9. Thus it finally has the appearance of the illustration in the margin. It is 
then completely victorious. It has demolished everything within reach save its 
foothold or base of supplies. The embryo sac iscomplete. Quite differently in the 
shallowwort (vincetoxicum) is this result effected. Like the aster’s, the shallow-

without any apparent regularity. In fig. 5 this is changed and a 
sphere isformed having the contents of the mother nucleus at the equa- 
tor. In fig. 6 this equator is separated and two new or ‘“‘ daughter” 
nucleiareformed. These also separate and form four “granddaughter” 
nuclei, so to speak, and these also separate and form eight ‘“grand- 
daughters,” four of which are in the upper end and four in the lower 
end of the embryo sac, which has greatly elongated. In the case of 
the aster one of the upper four moves down to the middle of the sac, 
and then one of the lower four moves up, both consolidating into one 
(fig. 12). This leaves a trio of cells as shown in Plate II (fig. A). Fig. wort’s ovule puts forth a mother cell. This mother cell like- 
wise increases in size,but at no moment of its existence is 
there the least trace of division by new cell walls, and the 
cell, at first like its neighbors, is enlarged and directly formed 
into an embryo sac. This direct transformation is very un- 
usual fora plant having two seed leaves, though among the 
lilies, the tulips, and frittillarias, which have but one, the 
fact is not rare.’ It is, however, by the lilies, which Mr. 
Grant White claims represent the immense threefold type of 
flowering plants,’ that it is intended to show what the mother 
cell does when it is transformed into the embryo sac. 
When the mother cell of the Turk’s cap lily (Liliwm marta- 
gon) has gathered headway, there may be noticed, in addition 
to the usual network structure, certain threads or 
streamers, which hewever vary in their lay with 
regard to different mother nuclei of the same 
stage of development. Some, as in fig. 1 of Plate I, 
form a sort of spherical envelope around the 
nucleus; others, as in fig. 3, stand out from it like 
bristles from a globular brush. In other cases the 
nucleus presents the appearance of fig. 2. But 
later on these differences vanish and the contents 
of the sac outside of the nucleus and the contents of 
the nucleus are mixed in the way shown in fig. 4, 
It will be seen how the bundles converge in fig, 4

THE VEGETABLE CELL. 
The first material fact in the vitality of a plant considered apart from earth and 
air is the cell; the next, the circulation of thesap. The oneis dead matter vitalized, 
the other disobeys the law of gravitation. Both being enigmas, a brief description 
of them will suffice. The vegetable cell is distinctly, though not quite universally, 
distinguished from the animal cell by two chemical features. Its cell wall is 
composed of cellulose, and it contains chlorophyll. Some animals, of which there 
seem to have been myriads during the pericd of geological time called the Paleo- 
zoic or old age of the world, possess a substance resembling cellulose, which has 
been called tunicine from its being found only in the mantle which covers the 
        ‘~ Chlorophiyl

Fungi and other “plants” have none. But let us restate these conceptions in 
another way. 
When yeast is filtered, it is separated into a solid and a liquid portion. The 
latter, when examined with a microscope, will be found to consist of small sphere- 
like bodies 0.025 to 0.007 of an inch in diameter, each an independent, living organ- 
ism, called a torula, floating in a liquid, from which it imbibes its nourishment, 
called a plasma. Again, if the green scum which is often observed collecting on

Let us now speak of a living cell, as we have of a plant which grows, feeds, 
respires, and reproduces itself. We shall find a cell doing the same things. In 
short, the plant is only a form of government of a society of cells whereby the 
whole community strengthen the Protococcus-like individual and produce vegeta- 
tive effects of a far higher order. Yet while the whole body continues to live the 
individuals are ceaselessly dying and reproducing. This balancing of life and 
death, which the cell system we call a plant masks, is related by Professor Bon- 
nier inthe inaugural lecture of his course on Vegetable Biology at the Sorbonne 
in 1887, following Hanstein, Loye,’ and perhaps others. 
This young cell, said he, pointing to an illustration, is wholly formed of thick 
(dense) protoplasm, which is marked off by thin partitions, while in the middle is 
the nucleus (cf. page 965, fig. 1, showing seven such cells in a pollen sac). Here 
is another illustration. The cell is now a little older. It has changed its form. 
Little drops of liquid are interspersed through the protoplasm. In this other illus- 
tration the structure is still further modified, the nucleus has now spread until 
it has almost reached the walls of the sac, and the protoplasm is only a thin layer 
between the sac wall and the nucleus. Here, finally, in the illustration I now 
show you there is neither protoplasm nor nucleus. (See Figure A of Torula 
above.) Those little partitions we found in the first illustration have been incu- 
bated, as it were, within the wall or sac of that mother cell. They have reached 
their utmost development, and the mother cell is dead. Thus a cell is born, 
grows, changes its form, reproduces itself, and dies. Yet this is not the only way, 
nor is it the most usual way of cell multiplication. A cell may divide itself by an 
hour-glass constriction the protoplasm separates itself into two parts. But does 
the cell feed and respire? By methods both delicate and precise, it has been 
determined that the protoplasm takes in oxygen and breaths out carbonic acid, 
therefore it breathes and nourishes itself. When the cell has chlorophyll within 
its protoplasm it has the additional function in a strong light of breaking up the 
carbonic acid of the air and assimilating the carbon.®

VEGETABLE HYDRAULICS OR THE ASCENT OF THE SAP. 
But if cells feed, as the professor at the Sorbonne tells us, how does the nour- 
ishment which comes from the ground reach them? In other words, by what 
charm do the cells in the uppermost branches of a towering pine call the water 
absorbed by the roots up to their lofty station, higher than the standpipes of our 
city waterworks? It has been urged that there is a pulling force caused by the 
evaporation of the leaves which causes the lower cells to hand up their water 
to the cells above them, while to account for the fact that if in summer a grape- 
vine be cut off near the ground and a hollow tube fitted over the stump the sap 
will flow far up into the tube, another force—a pushing force—is imagined. 
Whatever truth this theory may contain, it can not prove itself merely by its sim- 
plicity of structure.

  Perhaps in no country in the world is the tapping of trees for their sap so largely 
and systematically carried on as in New England, where there is quite an industry 
in maple-sugar making, though it is believed that the wild date tree is used in 
somewhat the same way in the oriental countries of the Indian seas. To those 
dwelling in New England, therefore, the flow of sap in the maple is a matter of 
fact that has long affected their business interests, and it has long been known to 
them that sap would flow from wounds in the wood of trees in spring; that the 
maple tree yields a large amount of sugar, and that the quantity and quality of 
the flow are affected by peculiarities of the season. It is said that few species 
of trees bleed at any time of the year when wounded, but several in the climate 
of New England, between the falling of the old and the pushing of the new leaves,

yield their juices when punctured, but lose that faculty when the young leaves 
appear. It has also been found that the sap flows readiest when freezing nights 
are followed by bright and warm days. But observe the diagram on page 973. 
Line A shows the fluctuation of a column of a siphon mercury barometer attached 
to a stopcock screwed into the sap wood of a tree at the level of the ground. 
Line B shows the fluctuation of a similar barometer 30.2 feet above. Line C 
shows the effect of the sun in starting up a pressure. All these observations were 
taken upon the same day, April 21,! and may be more particularly described as 
follows:. 
Line A: Pressure indicated by a column of mercury in a siphon-like tube in 
which whenever the mercury was at the same level in the two arms of the lower 
bend the pressure was put at zero. Line B: Pressure indicated by a similar gauge 
80.2 feet lower down on the same tree trunk, Line C represents another experi- 
ment ona maple tree. The drop between 12 m.andip.m.in lines A and Bis due 
to the fact that on April 21 at 12.30 p.m. a hole was bored into the tree opposite 
to the lower gauge at the same level. In fifteen minutes 1 pound of sap had 
run out and both gauges had fallen to an amount equal to 
19.27 feet of water. Upon closing the hole the mercury 
rose in ten minutes, as shown in the diagram. A stopcock 
having been inserted in the hole opposite the lower gauge, 
it was found that it could almost instantaneously make 
oz both gauges rise or fall in unison when closed or open. On 
the 11th of May the sap pressure indicated the weight of a 
column of water 84.77 feet high. The extraordinary rise 
just before 9 a. m. in line C is due to “the sun having warmed the tree.” The 
minus figures merely state that the middle tube had more mercury in it than the 
tube with its mouth exposed to the air. The black birch (Betula lenta) was a fine 
and sound forest tree 64 feet in circumference and 70 feet high; the maple, a 
healthy ‘‘shade tree” 5 feet in circuit and 60 feet high. 
As soon as the foliage of the birch appeared the upper gauge came to an equili- 
brium (‘‘zero”) on May 14 and the lower on May 27. Too much stress, therefore, 
should not be laid upon its action, except so far as it shows the behavior of the sap 
on the 2ist of April, 1873, as compared with a maple tree. But may it not be 
asked whether the tap root, for instance, of the birch is not a hydraulic ram or 
whether the whole tree is not a closed system of natural waterworks, a sort of 
vegetable artesian well, where levels go for nothing and vital forces for every- 
thing? That the maple tree should be so full of sap during the winter and should 
yield it so copiously during a warm day, if preceded by a freezing New England 
night, is another enigma. The cactus, a leafless plant of the arid region of New 
Mexico and Arizona, also yields a juice which is supposed to nourish the plant 
during the rainless portion of the year, and it may not be going too far tosay that 
during the winter the leafless tree, like the sugar beet, perfects the juices its foli- 
age has elaborated during the summer in order to flower and bear seed in the 
coming year. Fermentation has been suggested as the remoter cause of the 
growth ofa lichen and a bean; and to it also is attributed the ripening of grape 
juice into wine. By analogy there would seem to be an opening for a proposition 
to the effect that fermentation or the ripening of the sap causes spring flowers. 
Be this as it may, an experiment with an annual plant shows that the expansive 
force of a growing fruit will lift more weight at midnight, when the foliage is 
extetiorly at rest, than at any other time of day. Trees,

VEGETABLE MECHANICS OR MOTION OF AND IN PLANTS. 
On pages 928 and 930 it is shown that the leaf and the root are symmetrically 
arranged. The stem or wood portion of the trunk is likewise a symmetrical 
arrangement, as may be readily seen by the following cut: 
The stem of a tree is surmounted by a 
bud, and the bud is but a series of ex- 
panding leaves. The movement of the 
stem, then, need not detain us long, for 
the very raison d’étre of a tree trunk 
is to resist movement. Yet even tho 
trunk up which the sap flows records a 
spiral movement. Observe the illustra- 
tions on p. 976. In the first the spiral 
arrangement on the twig is pronounced. 
The fact there shown is a branch of bot- 
any—phyllotaxy, or the rules of leaf ar- 
rangement. But it may be objected that 
the cherry-tree twig is not a palm which 
consists of asingle growing bud. Tosuch 
objection the “boot” of the sabal palm or 
palmetto will afforda ready answer, for it shows by the arrangement of the foot 
stalks of the decayed leaves how nature distributed those leaves so as to give them 
the most light. 
It now remains to put in evidence the manner in which a bud is constructed and 
its method in extending the tree and fulfilling its purposes. In the first figure, 
p. 977, is shown a diagrammatic sketch of a flower-bearing bud and below it on each 
side two leaf buds. This diagram may be made to explain the growth of the tree 
yucca of the southern gulf coast, but considering the top bud alone the method of 
growth of the hemp agave called sisal is typified. This ‘‘succulent” after sending 
out its rigid century plant-like leaves for four or five years until the whole stands 
4 feet or so high completely exhausts its life by throwing up a spike of bloom 12 
or 15 feet, filled with branches bearing hundreds of little growing plants just like 
its own former but now defunct self, much to the disgust of those who in sub- 
tropical countries plant it for its tropical look and its indifference to full sunshine 
and absence of water. 
Nor are these things all that may be advanced as testimony that the sap twines 
around the tree. On p.977 are two representations, one of an alga (Riella helico- 
phylla), the second figure of the cut, the other of the sap wood of a decaying pine 
tree (Pinus palustris) in a turpentine orchard; the sap wood seems wrapped round 
the heart wood like the bandages arounda mummy. But it is of the leaf that it 
is necessary to speak. 
The leaf of a plant is one of the most prodigious creations of nature. Pro- 
fessor Helmholtz may have said that any German oculist could make a better 
optical apparatus than is the human eye, but no one would ever have the imperti- 
nence to make such a remark about a leaf. They purify the atmosphere of a gas 
deadly to animal life and liberate one which promotes it. They are necessary to 
the production of grain and are themselves a food for cattle, and if the almost 
complete dependence of industry and transportation upon steam be considered, 
then in the form of coal or wood the leaf has brought about the so-called ‘‘indus- 
trial revolution; or the age that we live in.” 
‘One of the most interesting facts with respect to the circumnutation of leaves 
is the periodicity of their movements, for they often, or even generally, rise a lit- 
tle in the evening and early part of night and sink again on the following morn- 
ing. Leaves also turn at night, and the leaves of some few plants move either 
upward or downward when the sun shines intensely on them; but all these move-

ments.” says Mr. Darwin, by whom these remarks were made, “are, we believe, of 
an essentially different nature.” Before entering upon the separation of these 
classes of movements it is well to show what interpretation may be placed upon 
them. 
People who live in houses in summer time are not apt to think how fast the 
earth cools off at night. Even in southern Florida in summer the cool night air 
is unpleasant; but when one approaches the equator or Central Africa, where in

daytime the thermometer is, to use Professor Drummond's expression of his feel- 
ings, ‘‘a billion centigrade,” one seldom lies down in his tent with fewer thana 
couple of blankets anda warm quilt.! As broad leaves have none of these conveni- 
ences, they are obliged to fall off and perish in autumn and to protect themselves 
during the summer nights, when the earth radiates the heat acquired during the

day from the solar radiations which have passed through the atmosphere to it. 
The diagram given on page 978 shows how much greater the heat of the surface of 
the earth is than that of the air. In short, immediately the rays of the sun cease 
to warm the surface of the soil, the surface rapidly loses its heat to the cooler air 
orradiates it like a stove cools off when the fire within it has gone out, though the 
earth does not give back all the heat that_has been shed uponit. Were that so, 
we would have no coal beds or forests in which are stored up some of the solar 
rays of former times. 
“We (Mr. Darwin, and his son, Mr. Francis Darwin) exposed on two occasions 
during the summer to a clear sky several pinned-open leaflets of Trifolium 
pratense, which naturally rise at night, and of Oxalis purpurea, which naturally 
sink at night (plants growing out of doors), and looked at them early on several 
successive mornings, after they had assumed their daylight positions. The 
  difference of the amount of dew on the pinned-open leaflets and on those which 
had gone to sleep was generally conspicuous, those having gone to sleep being 
sometimes absolutely dry, whilst the leaflets which had been pinned open were 
coated with large beads or dew. This shows how.much cooler the leaflets fully 
exposed to the zenith must have become than those which stood almost upright, 
pointing up or down during the night. From the many experiments we have 
made, there can be no doubt that the position of leaves at night affects their tem- 
perature through radiation to such a degree that when exposed to a clear sky 
during a frost it is a question of life and death.”! 
It is a wonderful spectacle, on a warm, sunny day, to behold the leaflets of the 
Averrhoa bilimbi, one after another, sinking rapidly downward and again 
ascending slowly, while at night the leaves hang vertically and motionlessly 
down.’ Indeed, Mr. Darwin was evidently impressed with Averrhoa bilimbi. It

The main leaf stock or petiole (a), which is in constant motion, was so stationed 
that the leaf stock of one of the leaflets (b) was at the center of a graduated arc 
placed behind it. To this leaflet (b) was fixed a fine glass filament in such a 
manner as to project like a continuation of the leaf stock and mid rib of the leaf. 
This filament acted as a pointer, and as the leaf rose and fell, rotating about its 
joining place with the main foot stalk (a), its angular movement could be recorded 
by reading off at short intervals of time the position of the glass filament on the 
graduated arc, and in order to avoid optical illusions the readings were made 
through a small ring painted on the vertical glass in a line with the leaf joint and 
the center of the graduated arc. In the following diagram we learn the course 
of the point of the leaflet during its evening descent, when going to sleep:

Let us see now how this leaf acted under a practically stationary temperature, 
put a quick change from bright sunshine to shadow (p.980). This will illustrate 
the second of the three causes of the movements of leaves, to wit, some few plants 
move either upward or downward when the sun shines intensely on them, which 
has sometimes been called diurnal sleep.' 
And finally here is the effect of a change of temperature of 14° F, during two 
hours and fifteen minutes in the heated part of the day (lower fig., p.980). This 
may, with some modifications as to the nodding around of the leaf or cireumnuta- 
tion, be taken to illustrate the third cause of movements that leaves make. 
The diagram upon the margin of the page 981 represents the circumnutation of 
aleaf of the well-known hothouse climber called Cissus discolor. The period of 
time spent by the leaf in scratching this outline outside of the hothouse in a tem-

AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 981: 
The first movement that a plant makes is to back out of its seed case.! The 
root at once strikes for the center of the earth. If seeds are germinated upon a 
wheel revolving parallel to the surface of the earth, the roots will follow an 
oblique line that will slant more or less toward the earth, according as the wheel 
goes round faster or slower. Having thus commenced, the root lifts what is 
called the head or top of the plant into the air, either from the ground or out of 
its own body. This head consists of two or more leaves, which have no more 
resemblance to the true foliage of the tree—the third phenomenon to appear—than. 
the tadpole has to the frog, as may be seen from figures D and E, page 982, specially 
selected to show extremes of divergence between the seed and the true leaves. 
The tip of the root or radicle, as it is called, as soon as it protrudes from the 
seed coats begins to circumnutate or revolves and the whole growing part con- 
tinues to do so as long as that root continues to grow. In winding its way down- 
ward the root insinuates rather than forces itself. The root of a sprouting bean 
will lift a weight of at least a quarter of a pound placed on'top of it, but will make 
no impression upon a piece of tinfoil placed beneath it, though that foil is so thin 
that a little soft-wood stick with an end resembling the root tip will dent itifa 
weight of a quarter of an ounce be gently placed upon its upper end.? It seems 
impossible to conceive of any motion forcible enough to penetrate 
the soil without connecting with it the idea of a blow delivered 
against the material through which entrance is being made, but 
the conception is facilitated if, instead of looking on the root tip as 
an awl driven by blows from within, we regard it as an hydraulic 
press. The root cap, a delicate point, finding entrance in the porous 
soil, is enlarged by the formation of new cells laid on within the 
socket of the cap which holds the root proper, and it may be 
assumed that a pressure that will lift a quarter of a pound will 
squeeze the earth aside. In the case of a pumpkin, indeed, we shall 
find the formation of cells lifting 5,000 pounds, just as the flow 
of sap indicated a pressure of 4 or even 5 atmospheres. But there 
is still another conjecture that may be ventured, and that is a com- 
parison of the sucking-in power of the root with that of the driven 
wellsunk toa gravelly stratum. Such a well will eventually absorb 
the very fine particles among the gravel, and, the water being lifted 
out thus, creates a reservoir or pocket for itself. 
To illustrate this, reference is made to the figures on page 931, proving that the 
muff of hairs is essentially the feeding part of the root. Let such a sprouting 
plant as is represented in those figures be carefully lifted and marked by some 
innoxious fluid into three parts, the lower one being divided into ten subsections, 
and then let the plant be placed in damp moss until its root has grown to three 
times its original length. It will be found that practically only the ten divisional 
marks have separated; in short, the root grows most between the cap and the top 
of muff, as is shown in the diagrams given in the cut on page 983. 
© We know that it is the part of the root just above the cap that grows the fastest, 
and it is certain that after the cap has been cut off the stump goes on growing at

such a rate that its length has often doubled in a day; nor does the removal of the 
cap prevent the part between the muff and the stump from bending if the plant has 
fairly started,” says Darwin.! With a muff of hairs soaking up the water above 
the cap, it would seem that the cap would never be earth bound and its shaft 
would always have room to wriggle and thus to work the cap toward water, 
for which its scent is as keen as that of a hound forits prey. It is not mineral

To do that requires time. 
HUMAN INTERFERENCE AND “NATURAL SELECTION’ IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 
Professor Wiesner, of Vienna, does not believe in circumnutation; his experi- 
ments with plants tell him a different tale. He contends that their movement is 
caused by a leaning first to this and then to the opposite side, due to inequality in 
the force which is lifting up, or, in the case of the root, pushing down the grow- 
ing mass, or even it may be caused by irregularity or unsymmetry of structure. 
This is substituting a mechanical view for the quite different one advanced by Dar- 
win as an hypothesis. On the Darwinian theory of adaptation of a plant to accom-

plish its own inheritance, it must apply old wheels, springs, and pulleys to new con- 
ditions.!_ A spiral movement, then, if a regular movement, is not an accident, but 
aninheritance. The act of nodding around or circumnutating is a spontaneous act, 
which in psychology is called refley. But in psychology a reflex act is @ “‘nervous” 
act, and is generalized and called the faculty of “irritability.” In vegetable phys- 
iology the nearest approach to a reflex act is a ‘‘ turgescence,” a swelling of the cell, 
or a number of cells, caused, it is said, by ‘‘osmosis.” Turgescence has two direc- 
tions, geotropic and heliotropic. Geotropism is the result when the plant bends 
toward or sinks its parts in the earth; heliotropism is when it rears its parts aloft. 
Geotropism may be called the effect of gravity, and heliotropism the effect of light. 
It is not the purpose on the present occasicn to enter into the niceties of either

of these isms, the literature of which is mostly in German, and has been largely 
the work since Hofmeister, of Sachs, and his botanical institute at the University 
of Wiirzburg. It is not to be wondered at that in the two countries of Europe— 
England and the South German States—where varied agriculture has flourished 
the best, we should find the best and most prolific investigations upon the dynam- 
ies of vegetation. It must be assumed then that roots are naturally geotropic and 
chlorophyllian leaves are naturally heliotropic. There is, therefore, strong evi- 
dence that plants show a reflex ac- 
tivity, that is to say, a spontaneous 
power within themselves to react 
upon their surroundings for their 
own good, and instead of agricul- 
tural instruction and inquiry confin- 
ing themselves to the soil, they may 
busy themselves like the breeder of 
sheep and of race horses with the orig- 
inal habitat and the reflex idiosyn- 
cracies of the plant. Indeed it may

be said that Mr. Darwin emits a criticism from which it may be inferred that this 
has not always been done. ‘‘ We experimented,” said that observer, ‘‘on a variety 
of the common pea, the Yorkshire Hero, which has a much wrinkled, tough skin, 
too large for the seed leaves, so that out of thirty peas which had been soaked for 
twenty-four hours and then allowed to germinate on damp sand, the radical or

abnormalities would probably never, or very rarely, occur with forms developed in 
a state of nature and subjected to natural selection.”! Professor Trail, of London 
University, England, informed Dr. Francis Warner that by increasing the edible 
or ‘‘cellular” portion of the wild carrot, which is comparatively largely composed. 
of fiber, the ‘cultivated root is much more liable to disease from attack of fun- 
gus, while fluids from the soil have to penetrate through a thicker layer of cellu- 
lar tissue [or flesh] to the vascular bundles [or fibers] than in the case of the 
wild plant. The altered proportional growth of parenchyma [flesh] and the vas- 
cular bundles [fiber] may be advantageous to the gardener, but is not advanta- 
geous to the plant.”® It is therefore proper to ask, ‘‘ What is natural selection?” 
The part of the plant which is most attractive to the insect, as well as to the 
human eye, is the flower. Yet lichens, mosses, and fungi are constantly taken as 
models by insects, and there is probably nothing in the vegetable kingdom that is 
not imitated by some animal form,’ but the menteur 4 triple étage, the thrice-dyed 
liar of this description, is the African insect whose disproportionately broadened 
back bears the impress of a vivid green leaf with midrib and veins complete. 
On the other hand, plants have uses for insects. ‘The forms and colors of wild 
flowers,” says Sir John Lubbock, an authority on the manner and customs of

insects, ‘‘are mainly owing to the unconscious selection exercised by insects, 
although no doubt the existence of a certain amount of coloring matter is, as we 
see in the autumn tints, in various fungi, seaweeds, etc., due to other causes.” It 
will at once appear what an important bearing these facts would have in suggest- 
ing or proving an hypothesis that maintains that self-fertilization tends to produce 
weaklings in the vegetable kingdom, and that cross fertilization—that is, the fer- 
tilization of one flower by the pollen brought from another—is necessary to the 
production of a vigorous vegetable constitution.* 
It has been shown how plants ‘‘sleep.” It is the same with flowers. The dan- 
delion is said to close at 5 p. m., the white water lily at 4, while other flowers, 
like the night-blooming cereus, open only in the cool of the evening, or, like the

morning glory, in the freshness of breaking day. ‘‘I would venture to suggest,” 
says Sir John Lubbock, ‘‘that the closing of flowers may have reference to the 
habits of insects, and I may observe, in support of my suggestion, that wind- 
fertilized flowers do not sleep.”! Be this as it may, Mr. Darwin does not hesitate 
likewise to venture an assertion that “as plants are adapted by such diversified 
and effective means for cross fertilization, it may be inferred from that fact 
alone that they derive some great benefit from the process.” In fact, such an 
inference is the positive or ethical import of the Darwinian hypothesis.’ 
Three of the tests made by Mr. Darwin as to the variation of plants under human 
manipulation are especially prominent, two of them, those on an exotic morning 
glory and on the pea, being pointed out by himself, and one, on corn (Zea mais), 
by Mr. Galton, who selects the results for statistical interpretation from a number 
of sets of observations. 
Mr. Darwin bred ten gene- \< Where the growth of each cross fertilized 
rations of plants of the gercratton had reached this height, the 
morning glory, and as far self fertilized, had only reached the height 
as the vigor of generation \ indicated by the 
is concerned the following Bente mae 
diagram will show the re- 
sults. The taller line indi- 
cates the height to which 
theplants grew which came 
from seeds produced by the 
fecundating matter of two 
different flowers on two dif- 
ferent plants. The shorter 
lines indicates the height to 
which plants grew which 
came from seeds which 
were produced by one 
flower of a plant entirely 
within itself. 
Beforeturning to another 
test, which had an entirely 
different suggestion, let us ml = 
make a distinction about moe ae er eee 5 S 8 
progenitors of the seeds ex- 
perimented with. Let us call all seeds formed by the flower itself, whether com- 
posed of one or more pistils, an incestuous seed, formed by vegetable brothers and 
sisters, but when the seed is formed by the pistil or female portion of one flower 
when fecundated by the pollen from the anther of another flower (both flowers 
coming from sister or brother seeds), then let us call the seed formed by that kind 
of cross fertilization cousin seeds. It will be observed that the long line repre- 
sents the vigor of the cousin seeds and the shorter ones the incestuous seeds. To 
show that there is not the slightest attempt to beg the question for the cousin 
seed by the mere ideas which words suggest, another Darwinian test is given, in 
which the incestuous seeds apparently turn the tables on the cousins. This is the 
experiment with a variety of the pea called the ‘‘ Early Emperor ” which had been 
self-fertilized for many generations:

Mr. Darwin,’ ‘‘if any two varieties out of the numberless ones which exist had 
been crossed.” But the element he lays particular stress upon is environment. 
He ascertained by crossing the ninth generation of morning glory cousins with 
pollen from a stranger family that he could produce plants as superior to the 
tenth generation (100 to 78) of cousins as that generation (100 to 77) was superior 
to the tenth incestuous generation. ‘The most important fact at which I have 
arrived,” he says, ‘is that the mere act of crossing by itself does no good. The 
good depends on the individuals which are crossed differing slightly in constitu- 
tion, owing to their progenitors having been subjected during several generations 
to slightly different conditions, or to what in our ignorance we call spontaneous 
variation. * * * This throws light on the origin of the two sexes and on their 
separation or union in the same individual, and lastly on the whole subject of 
hybridism, which is one of the greatest obstacles to the general acceptance and 
progress of the great principle of evolution.’” 
Still as between plants from cousin seeds and those from incestuous seeds the 
greater constitutional vigor is with the cousins, They not only grow higher, after 
getting well started, but they will withstand extremes of temperature better, the 
deadly pressure of competition in a crowded vegetable community, and even when 
they have not exceeded the plants from incestuous seeds in growth, when cut 
down they sprout and grow more vigorously. It is now necessary to close these 
remarks about heredity with the facts about plants grown from corn seeds, by 
Mr. Darwin, and sent to Mr. Galton for statistical arrangement, as before men- 
tioned.

THE SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY. 
Some explain the movements of plants by saying that the plant performs its 
movements in a mechanical manner as the compass needle follows the magnet, 
others that there is an act of willing perhaps, certainly a reflex or spontaneous 
act on the part of the plant, such as the winking of the eye when suddenly 
affected. In short, on one side it is claimed that the plant moves mechanically 
because its cells swell (turgesce) unequally, and on the other that the plant is 
endowed with “irritability.” ‘‘When my father wrote our book upon the power

of movement in plants,” says Mr. Francis Darwin,' “he adopted the conception 
of irritability, and the only trace that he'was able to find of similar ideas was 
a passage from Sachs, in which that writer said: ‘The living matter of plants is 
internally differentiated in such a way that the different parts are endowed with 
specific energies resembling those of the nerves (Sinnesnerven) of animals.’”? 
The nearest approach that science can make to living matter is a class of chemical 
compounds called the compounds of carbon * (or organic chemistry), which at one 
time were thought to be producible by living organisms alone. But this idea has 
been shown to be erroneous, for several of such compounds have been formed 
from inorganic substances without the intervention of the ‘‘life process,” and 
these successes have changed the ‘new chemistry” of the sixties into a still newer 
chemistry to which the name “synthetic” is being given, as itis basedon construc- 
tive rather than destructive analysis. In fact, beside the chemistry of oxygen 
and the oxides there is now the chemistry of the carbons, while hydrogen and 
nitrogen in the oxide forms of water or nitric acid have a leaning toward carbon 
that is peculiar to themselves, though it is going much too far to say that their 
combinations with carbon form “living matter of plants,” a property which is 
generally spoken of as belonging particularly to ‘ protoplasm.” 
The first result of synthetic chemistry was startling. Water was made out of 
two ‘“‘airs.” The apparatus by which this feat was accomplished in the hands of 
an Englishman, Cavendish, was not intricate. An open-mouthed glass jar, turned 
upside down, was filled with hydrogen, and then a candle and oxygen were intro- 
duced, the water formed collecting on the sides of the jar and dropping down. 
To a French chemist, however, belongs the honor of founding the synthetic chem- 
istry. This gentleman, Monsieur M, Berthelot, succeeded in making acetylene by 
igniting carbon sticks in an atmosphere of hydrogen. In the following notice an 
attempt will be made to explain, with as few inaccuracies as possible, the ideas of 
M. Berthelot, who may be looked upon as doing for the chemistry of the carbon 
compounds or organic chemistry what M. Lavoisier did for the chemistry of the 
oxides or inorganic chemistry. 
In ‘‘organic chemistry founded upon synthesis,” there are eight fundamental 
types, eight types performing eight functions, eight functions here synthetically 
arranged in the order of their formation. 
I. Hydrogenated carbons (acetylene CH, ethelene CH?, etc.). 
II. Oxidized hydrogenated carbons formed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. 
(a) Alcohols, Ordinary alcohol, for example. 
(b) Aldehydes. An alcohol from which two atoms of hydrogen have been taken, 
such as camphor. 
(c) Acids. An oxidized aldehyde, acetic acid. 
(d) Ethers. Ordinary ether, for example, formed from an alcohol by treatment with 
potassium, sodium, iodine, bromine, chlorine, or from (b) or (c). 
Ill. Nitrified hydrogenated carbons formed of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. 
(a) Alcalis. The union of ammonia with the alcohols or aldehydes. 
(b) Amides. The union of ammonia with the acids with separation of water, such as 
albumen. 
IV. Compound metallic radicals formed by the reaction of the metals upon certain ethers, such 
as cacodyle composed of carbon, hydrogen, and arsenic. 
Of all these functions, two—the hydrogenated carbons and the oxidized hydro- 
genated carbons called alcohols—are of the greatest importance. These once 
obtained, it is easy to form the six other functions. These two, then, are the true 
foundation of organic chemistry. The hydrogenated carbons are formed by the 
action of the electric arc upon hydrogen and carbon as shown in the cut below.

Acetylene (CH) being thus produced, ethelene or “‘olefiant gas” (CH*) is gener- 
ated from it in the same way by certain precautions, and so on to formene or 
‘“‘marsh gas” (CH‘). Now, acetylene may be condensed into a liquid which is 
like, but is not, water. These products are called diacetylene, triacetylene 
(‘‘benzine”), tetracetylene, or styrolene, which is formed by vegetables, etc., 
according as two, three, four, or more acetylene molecules unite to form the liquid. 
  
  
                            
      
            
                  
                                                      
    
    
The method of M. Berthelot in making acetylene one of the two bases of the chemistry of 
living substances.—Troost’s Chemistry. 
From the same property ammonia gas is used as a refrigerating agent. A quan- 
tity of water, having been saturated with ammonia gas, is heated in the cylinder 
A, and the gas is freed and passes over into the cool vessel B and liquefies, as 
shown in the illustration. Then the vessel C containing the water to be frozen 
into ice is placed in the vessel B and the cylinder A is surrounded with cold water. 
The liquid ammonia in B slowly changes back into a gas, which is again absorbed. 
by the water in A, and, in doing so, makes things so cold in B, which ithas left, as 
to freeze the pure water in C, which was the object to be effected by the operations. 
Why liquids should act thus in vaporizing is a 
very large subject, and it will suffice to say that 
*‘a great quantity of heat becomes latent during 
the formation of a gas;” yet to illustrate the cur- 
ious effects produced, when common air has been 
so condensed as to be heard dropping in the con- 
denser and so congealed as to resemble blanc 
mange (it ‘is a curious sight to see a cake of it 
well up in the middle as it changes back into 
air on being taken from the condenser”) an 
account of the apparatus used in the process is 
given in Note A to this chapter. But let us pass 
to the oxidized hydrogenated carbons, and par- 
y 7 Z vn ticularly the alcohols. 
iaAizitivoiasanaching. In the methodic presentation of the threefold 
or ternary compounds of carbon with hydrogen 
and oxygen the alcohols are of the greatest importance. Prepared by the means 
of the hydrogenated carbons, they, in turn, are used to fabricate the ethers, alde- 
hydes acids, alcalis, and the rest. M. Berthelot so insists upon the chimie synthé- 
tique as opposed to the chimie analytique, that the difference must be illustrated. 
In a wine glass halt filled with mercury let a tube filled with acetylene and hydro- 
gen be introduced as shown in the view. Then let the tube be warmed and the 
result will be that “ the organic” base acetylene (CH) will be hydrogenated and   
  
   
-P-A-G-E-1071

become partly, in such an apparatus, ethylene (CH*). This, like the illustra- 
tion of the formation of acetylene, is ethelene formed by synthesis. Note on the 
other hand the production of ethelene by analysis. First about 50 metric grams 
of alcohol are poured into a cup surrounded by cold water, then about 300 
grams of concentrated sulphuric acid is added, the whole being shaken to prevent 
breaking the glass. When the compound has cooled off it is run into a glass 
retort, as shown in the illustration, having some sand in the bottom. The alcohol 
under the influence of the sulphuric acid changes into ethylene and water, the 
first flowing off through the tube is washed in the first flask which contains 
potash to absorb carbonic and sulphurous acids passing along in company with 
the ethylene and again is acted on in the second flask which contains sulphuric 
acid which catches the ether while the ethylene passes on purified. 
Now, if, as Dumas said, the discovery of the chemical principle of the alcohols 
is as important as the discovery of a new metal, it will be evident that the syn- 
thetic manner of forming them out of acetylene and its forms of benzine and 
marsh gas and the like will be of interest not only to temperance crusaders and to

distillers, but to the public in general. Alcohols, says M. Berthelot, are divisible 
into five great classes: 
Alcohols properly so called or primary alcohols. 
Watered alcohols (alcools d*hydratation) or secondary alcohols. 
Tertiary alcohols. 
Phénols. 
Alcohols having a mixed function (a fonction mixte). 
These are subdivisible into orders, monotomic, diatomic, etc., according as the 
one or more molecules of water they contain is replaceable by an organic acid, 
and these orders are subdivisible into families, such as acetylic alcohols, benzenic 
alcohols, etc. We are here concerned with formation of a genuine alcohol. There 
is first the method of substitution, in which every hydrogenated carbon engenders 
an alcohol by substituting water for part of the hydrogen contained in marsh gas 
CH?(H?) forexample. In short, the carbon, before merely hydrogenated, is now 
hydrated by the addition of oxygen. But the work of water is still more emphatic 
in the making of an alcohol from a hydrogenated carbon by the method of addi- 
tion. In the method of substitution half the hydrogen was oxidized, but in the 
method by addition the elements of water (hydrogen and oxygen) are simply

added, but this is only possible with low grades of hydrogenation, such as acetylene 
(CH) or ethylene (CH,). Insisting, then, irrespective of M. Berthelot, on the 
value of ‘‘substituting ” and ‘‘adding ” water, or the ‘‘ elements of water” in the 
proportion in which water is formed, to the formation of the hydrocarbons or car- 
bohydrates, known as cellulose, glucose, and cane sugar, and the other secretions 
of vegetable life, we pass to his conclusion générale: 
The point of departure for the formation of organic matters is the same as that 
of the formation of mineral matters. We start out with carbon, hydrogen, oxy- 
gen, and nitrogen. With these and the mere play of the mineral forces we have 
formed twofold compounds of a fundamental nature and principally the hydro- 
genated carbons. They constitute the keystone of the whole edifice of organic 
chemistry. After having formed the hydrogenated carbons we have constructed, 
always starting out from realized facts and basing our work on methodical treat- 
ment and following general laws, a new class of compounds called alcohols, a 
threefold substance having no resemblance to anything in mineral chemistry and, 
moreover, formed here by the mere play of affinities. This synthesis gives to 
organic chemistry a definite basis. The alcohols in turn combine with the [organic] 
acids to form the ethers, a new class of artificial compounds, naturally produced 
as the odor of the greater number of fruits, aromatic and irritating qualities, 
seeds, such as in gaultheria and in mustard, and the waxes, such as beeswax. 
These same alcohols united to ammonia give rise to artificial alkalies, which, their 
laws being known, permits us to hope that at an early day we can reproduce arti- 
ficially the vegetable alkalies, such as morphine, quinine, strychnine, nicotine, and 
other active principles in vegetation. 
Again, if we manipulate the process a little we can oxidize the alcohols so as to 
form the aldehydes, a very singular group which contain the greater number of 
the naturally oxygenated essences, such as th. odor of mint and bitter almonds, 
ordinary camphor, etc., but_to make these essences it is tirst necessary to realize 
the formations of the alcohols from-which they are to be formed. A higher degree 
of oxidation of the alcohols engenders another class of compounds, the organic 
acids. A multitude of natural acids have been artificially formed from the alco- 
hols, such as the acid of vinegar, of beer, of valerian; but when we come to the 
natural acids still more oxygenated, such as malic and tartaric, acids then we are 
unable as yet to produce by synthesis in our laboratories what nature produces in 
hers. From theacids come the ethersandthe amides. The amides are compounds 
which are the result of the combination of acids with ammonia. To the study of 
the amides belongs undoubtedly the formation of all the natural nitrogenous prin- 
ciples which are-not derived from the alcohols. Among the principles which have 
been artificially created by the synthetic chemistry it will suffice to mention urea, 
one of the most important excretions of the higher animals, taurine matter con- 
tained in the bile, gelatin, sugar, leucin, and hippuric acid. These general groups 
of organic compounds comprehend the volatile matters and the bodies that may be 
formed by them. What has been effected in the artificial formation of substances 
formed in living bodies is only the first stage of organic chemistry. Fibrine and 
woody fiber and the sugared and albuminous matters dissolved in the liquids 
which bathe these tissues are still without the sphere of the chemistry by synthe- 
sis. The discovery of the way in which these substances may be made artificially 
will be the second stage of the progress of biologic chemistry. 
A review of the material sources of vegetation tends to affirm the old idea that 
plants are creatures of the atmosphere. ‘‘Man,” said the Chemist Dumas, ‘“‘is 
condensed air,” and if that assertion can be made with some degree of probability 
of man, it is still more probably true of the food of man or of the food of the ani- 
mals upon which man feeds. It has been already remarked on this occasion that 
nature, unlike thesynthetic chemistry, starts with compounds. She takes an oxide 
of carbon, the deadly carbonic-acid gas,and it is broken up into its elements by 
the mechanism of theleaf worked by the sunbeams. Neglecting the free nitrogen 
of the air, she for some inexplicable reason feeds it to the plant in the form of 
nitric acid, another deadly poison, through the mechanism of a fungus microbe 
which works under cover of the soil. Hydrogen alone she is compelled to furnish 
to the plant in a compound form, and as for oxygen the plant in daylight both 
discards and absorbsit atthe same time. These substancesare notcostly. Theair 
is composed of oxygen and nitrogen and there is enough carbonic acid in it to sup-

ply many times over the needs of terrestrial vegetation, while water abounds 
except in vast interior basins like the American Desert, the Sahara, and the 
interior of Australia. Can science aid agriculture to appropriate these elements 
regularly and systematically? Thatisa problem of agricultural economy. What 
chemicalsshall be poured into the soil? Thatis a problem of agricultural hygiene. 
Both are branches of practical agricultural chemistry. 
The synthetic chemistry teaches us that the ‘‘elements” of biologic chemistry 
are not the sixty or seventy “elements” of the text-books, and spectrum analysis 
suggests the possibility that those sixty or seventy elements may be compounds, as 
M. Berthelot has shown the organic elements to be. The word element may there- 
fore be a mere relative expression, and in any starting out it is possible to think 
that a table of elements may be drawn up to suit the convenience of the voyager. 
It therefore seems not unworthy of consideration to begin agricultural chemistry 
with a study of water, nitrification, the assimilation of carbon from carbonic acid, 
and the formation of the hydrogenated and hydrated carbons within the plant. 
Among the many questions by which the brightest intellects which have busied. 
themselves with agricultural chemistry are cowed is one which may be formulated 
in these words: Can I feed pigs on corn so that at six months old they will weigh 
800 pounds? If so, what breed of pigs, on what kind of corn? This is a practical 
question, for a true answer to it would have enabled the possessor of the secret to 
have enriched himself at the expense of his neighbors who had not been sharp 
enough to obtain it. But to look upon public institutions as purveyors of money- 
making information for the practical inquirer is no more respectable than for a 
woman under the poor laws of England to regard herself as an heiress because she 
had a claim upon the parish for each of her five illegitimate children. 
The farmers of western Europe, finding that the many agricultural colleges of 
their respective governments were incapable of telling each one how to get ahead of 
his neighbors in raising pigs, have begun the formation of trusts or ‘‘syndicates.” 
So powerful are these organizations becoming that they merit attention and study. 
In the portion of this chapter which immediately follows these institutions are 
described after a brief review of the history of the agricultural population of 
Europe. 
Part II.—SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPTIONS.! 
The growth of cities in population is frequently regarded as somehow connected 
with the present depression in agriculture (which it is the purpose of agricul- 
tural education to remove), though it might be supposed that the increase in the 
number of city dwellers would infallibly increase the price of the productions of 
the farmer. Such isnot the case; and before engaging in the study of cooperation 
among producers of food and other raw material, the object of this portion of the 
chapter, it may be well to inquire under what conditions of birth rate, personal 
aspirations, and human faculties the people of the open country emigrate to the 
city, since, as Bacon says, ignorance of the cause masks the effect. 
The great desire to live in cities which now animates the people of the nineteenth 
century is not peculiar tothem. Before Rome had policed the Mediterranean Sea 
the little city-states that fringed its shores and occupied its islands were accus- 
tomed to store their productions and plunder in citadels built, as at Athens and 
Corinth, upon a precipitous rock; and subsequently, as their wealth and commerce 
increased, to inclose the citadel with wide-extending walls, as many centuries 
later the colonists in America built their blockhouse and then surrounded it with 
a stockade. But protection of life and property is not the incentive that is now 
1It is to be remarked that the second congress (1896) of cooperation, composed of men of high 
political and social standing, demanded that every public-school child should be compelled to 
study cooperation in all agricultural and industrial schools for pupils over 15.

causing the cities to grow, for the present movement of the population is a uni- 
versal influence experienced by a very largenumber of individuals. These nomadic 
impulses are inherent in human nature, and the restlessness they produce in soci- 
ety at large has not failed to receive attention from government after each nation 
has passed from the pastoral or wandering condition to one of fixed territorial 
confines or nationality, or, in other words, become a state, or, in the language of 
the Greeks, a city. 
COLONIZATION, 
The most vigorous manner in which a society is relieved of its restless or dis- 
agreeable elements is by an emigration which is induced by the hope of fortune or 
of escaping the control of too rigorous laws. ‘The revocation of the Edict of Nantes 
sent 400,000 useful merchants and artisans forth from France, and the possibilities 
of acquiring wealth in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main relieved Spain of 
many thousands of adventurers and nobles for whom she had no use after the 
expulsion of the Moors, The interference with the Puritan form of worship by 
the English Government peopled New England, and the defeat of ‘‘King and 
Church party” by the Presbyterians under Cromwell greatly swelled the popula- 
tion of Virginia. The devastation of the Palatinate, one of the war measures of 
Louis XIV, and the faniine in Ireland, due to an exclusive reliance upon a single 
crop, caused thousands to leave their native land for one holding out promises of 
a more successful existence. 
Another method of relieving society of an uncongenial element is that of trans- 
portation. This, however, is far different from the natural emigration referred 
to above, since government seizes the person of the emigrant and sends him out 
of the country either as a criminal or an insurrectionist. Tasmania was many 
years ago the penal colony of England, and France exported her criminal men and 
women to the New World, as is graphically told in the romance of Manon Lescaut 
by the Abbe Prevost, who probably saw the occurrences which he makes his hero- 
ime experience. Czsar relieved Rome, ‘that den of robbers,”! of 80,000 of its 
proletariate by transporting them beyond the Italian seas, and in ancient Greece 
the expatriation of a group of obstinate citizens was frequently and consciously 
made the remedy of relieving a political crisis, in order to serve, to use the lan- 
guage of Curtius, ‘as a blood-letting in times of local feverish excitement.” 
In all this, let it be remarked, there is something of preconcertion or coordi- 
nation, and the movement is conceived to have taken place in the manner accord- 
ing to which we fancy to ourselves the Aryans moving through the passes of the 
Himalayas or the Helvetii, in Cesar’s account, moving into Gaul. It is the mass 
we see; but to see the individual actors, to separate out an idea of the sweep of 
the movement, we must study the emigration from the Atlantic coast across the 
Alleghenies. The Spaniards founded cities in America and dwelt in them; the 
French established a line of trading posts from Quebec to New Orleans; but tho 
English have conquered the country, and in it the English language and the com- 
mon law prevails. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE. 
Nevertheless, during antiquity and throughout the middle ages allmen were not 
at liberty to go where they pleased in pursuit of happiness. In the republics of 
ancient Greece and Rome the State, or, as it was called, the “city,” was conceived 
as one separate class of inhabitants, called citizens, relieved from all private toil 
and all money-getting employments; ‘‘for it clearly follows,” says Aristotle, ‘that 
1Mommsen, Vol. IV, pp. 596,598: “From the whole compass of the widespread empire people 
flocked to Rome for speculation, for debauchery, for intrigue, for accomplishment in crime, or 
even for the purpose of hiding there from the eye of the law.” If we try to conceive a London 
with the slave population of a former New Orleans, with the police of a modern Constantinople, 
the nonindustrial character of modern Rome, and the barricades and street riots of Parisin 1848, 
we shall acquire an approximate idea of the republican glory of ancient Rome.

in the State which is best governed the citizens who are absolutely and not merely 
relatively just men must not lead the life of mechanics or tradesmen, for such a 
life is ignoble and inimical to virtue; neither must they be farmers, since leisure 
is necessary both for the development of virtue and the performance of political 
duties.”! ‘‘Government,” says Mr. Edmund Burke in his Reflection on the French 
Revolution, evidently following Aristotle, ‘‘is not based on natural rights, but 
is to provide for human wants, and society requires not only that the passions of 
individuals should be subjected, but in the mass and body, as well as in the indi- 
viduals, the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted, their will con- 
trolled, and their passions brought into subjugation.” 
There have been three systems by which this subjugation has been attempted 
in European history, called, respectively, slavery, serfdom, and education. Upon 
each of these it is excusable to dwell for a moment in order to bring them into 
proper light, as two of them, slavery and serfdom, have signally failed to accom- 
plish their purpose, and are matters of antiquarian interest. 
SLAVERY. 
“Tf a future historian,” says M. Fustel de Coulange, ‘‘some centuries hence 
should attempt to relate the history of our civilization, it would be particularly 
necessary for him to study many things besides the life of the rural districts; but 
for the life of the European peoples existing between the Roman Republic and 
the sixteenth century, the study of their country life is sufficient.” On the coun- 
try estate was transacted the far larger part of the work, and there were elab- 
orated both the wealth and the power of the community. It was in the interior 
of the country estate that men were brought together, and there the liberties and 
the restrictions belonging to each class were most marked, their inequalities 
exhibited, and their agreements and differences illuminated. To illustrate one of 
the inequalities thus announced by M. Fustel de Coulange, it is sufficient to say 
that Roman society had what it called a slave, or thing (res). This res was defined 
legally as one who is controlled by another, as property over which the master 
had the right of life or death, of loaning, pawning, or whipping. It is evident 
how differently a noncriminal white person is regarded at the present day. It is 
also evident that as all the slave earned was his master’s, he would not be unduly 
excited by the spirit of acquisition.. During the time of the firs; Roman empe- 
rors many of these rural slave persons were chained in gangs (vinctii). Thus the 
slave not only lacked liberty, but personality. This loss of personality was the 
especial vice of the system, for, notwithstanding the possibilities of cruelty, it is 
safe to say that the orderly slave was kindly treated.” 
The numerical proportion of this rural slave population (many of whom were 
degenerated freemen) to the whole rural population is unknown. In Attica, con- 
taining the city of Athens, out of 500,000 people about 400,000 were neither citizens 
nor the wives or children of citizens. 
SERFDOM. 
But from the very trend of civilization even during the days of the Roman 
Empire a beginning was made to ameliorate the condition of the slave. The 
effort was in the nature of an appeal to the instinct in man which leads him to try 
1 Politics, ‘The governing classes,” p. 221, vol. 1, of Jewett's translation. Grote interprets 
this in this way: The whole territory of the State belongs to them and is tilled by independent 
cultivators, by whom the produce is made over and apportioned under certain restrictions. 
Of course it will be understood that the politics is a theory about a State existing under exceed- 
ingly antiquated conditions.

  to take care of himself if compelled to. Some slaves were given plots of land to till 
for themselves. The master was thus freed from the necessity of providing for 
the slave’s support, and could grasp as much as prudence or as little as generosity 
might suggest; but the first determined step in the way of enfranchisement was 
the enregistering these ‘“‘cabined slaves” and their families as servi adscripti for 
the purpose of public taxation. Finally the State became strong enough to forbid 
the master to sell the servus adscriptus unless the ground he tilled and his hut 
were included as a part of the same transaction. It can not be said that the daily 
life of the slave was softer; probably, says M. Fustel de Coulange, it was harder 
for him, considering the slender resources he had at his command to struggle for 
existence. But he began to havea soul; he had a home from which, it is true, 
he might not move, but from which it is also true he could not legally be 
moved. He had a wife and children; he had cares to worry him; success or defeat 
to elevate or depress him, and he became acquainted with the great factors of 
industrial life. 
The germ of serfdom as a modification of slavery was merely sown by the 
Romans. It was nourished and propagated by the Germanic tribes that overran 
the Roman Empire. The Roman cabined serf was servus adscriptus—a slave 
inscribed on the tax lists; the feudal serf became fully ascriptitius glebae, one 
having a holding. As the northern tribes settled down, the maxim “no land with- 
out its lord”! policed the territory to which the serf was attached until the growth 
of cities, the Reformation, and the French Revolution swept the system out of 
existence. The system of serfdom has been commented upon in this language: 
“To live and die as a serf upon the soil where one is born is the life of a plant 
which, while nourishing itself, is plundered of its fruit by its owner;” neverthe- 
less it may be added it is better than to be the mere talking tool, ‘‘the instru- 
mentum vocale ”? of the Roman country estate. 
EDUCATION. 
At the close of the period called the Reformation the peoples whom that move- 
ment deeply touched seem to have specialized their energies. The French have 
won for themselves the European preeminence in art and literature, the Germans 
have cultivated philosophy both as religion and natural defense, and the English 
have thrown themselves into commerce and colonization. But even before the 
Reformation the people of England seem to have manifested a talent for personal 
freedom as eventually expressed in the law of Habeas Corpus and the Bill of 
Rights, only equaled by the Hellenic talent for form in art and literature and the 
Roman talent for centralization. Long before the expiration of the middle ages 
the courts held the serf to be a freeman against everybody but the owner of the 
land he was ‘‘ascribed to,”’ and by the criminal or State law* he was on a perfect 
equality, as far as responsibility is concerned, with anybody in the land. He 
could appeal to the itinerant judge, whether ‘‘in eyre” or at ‘‘nisi prius,” and 
place himself upon ‘‘his country” when he was claimedasaserf. It seems impos- 
sible to separate the growth of personal freedom from the practice of the courts of 
Westminster and the representation of the serf in the transaction of the business

their powers to form a Federal Government.

4The criminal law of England was a State monopoly long before it became so on the Conti- 
nent. Thus the court of King’s bench, the highest of the three courts of law (King’s bench, 
common pleas, and exchequer) had a “Crown side,” which took cognizance of all criminal 
causes, and the ‘‘plea side,” which took cognizance of all civil causes except those of real (land) 
property (court of common pleas) and ‘‘revenue”’ (court of exchequer).

of the little local baronial court;' nor is it wide of the mark to regard the prin; 
ciple of the feudal system in England to be an effort to keep the land under culti- 
vation, on the Aristotelian maxim of a division of labor between a class who are 
to work and not think and a class who are to think and fight but not otherwise to 
work.? In England the State in the beginning being an agricultural community, 
the organization of the people was effected by allowing the landlord certain rights 
upon the agriculturist as pay for his policing the manor over which he presided. 
With such a theory and the common law to invigorate and support it, the troubles 
which characterized the French Revolution culminated in England nearly two cen- 
turies before they did on the other side of the channel; but the political movement 
for personal liberty, ‘‘the rights of man,” was in England masked under the name 
of theology and not under that of the “‘law of nature.” There is no English law 
repealing serfdom such as that passed in France on the evening of August 4, 1789, 
nor any cabinet order like that of Prussia in 1808. Serfdom in England died out of 
pure inanition, and the last that was ever heard of it was a stray case during the 
reign of James I (1618).’ In the process of this decay, which seems to have been 
particularly rapid during the disarming of the feudal barons by Henry VII, many 
persons were thrown upon the country, and to reduce the restlessness of the pop- 
ulation the famous act of the fifth year of Elizabeth (1563) was passed, under the 
title of the statute of apprentices, though Mr. Froude claims that the act of the 
twenty-seventh year of Henry VIII (1536), drawn by that monarch with his own 
hand, was the first compulsory education law, for such that historian claims it 
to be.* ~ 
The seizure of the English monasteries by Henry VIII was based, in history at 
least, upon the plea that the funds which had accumulated in the hands of the 
religious corporations had not been given for the private use of the church, but 
for the poor and their instruction. But the money obtained in this way seems 
to have been appropriated somewhat after the manner described by Edmund 
Burke in these terms: ‘The monarch having sucked the blood of his prey 
threw the carcass to the jackals in waiting.” Nevertheless about 250 ‘‘grammar” 
(i. e., Latin) schools were established for the education of that middle class or 
gentry which ruled England for the next three hundred years. Perhaps instead

(in Sources of United States Constitution, a British work) calls attention to Taylor’s ‘admi- 
rable condensation of the growth of the connection of the State with the local courts.” In the 
course of the assessment and collection of the revenue, which was the chief work of the curia 
regis as a financial body, local disputes so constantly arose that it became necessary to send 
detachments of justices to adjust the business of the exchequer in each shire. As early as the 
reign of Henry I (1100 to 1135, say half a century after the conquest), officers of the exchequer 
were frequently sent through the country to assess the revenue; and in the reign of his grand- 
son this custom was enforced with systematic regularity. The justices while thus engaged in 
provincial business sat in the shire moots where judicial work soon followed in the path of their 
official duties. In 1176 the Kingdom was divided into six circuits, to each of which were assigned. 
three justices, who now for the first time were given in the “Pipe Rolls” the name of Justitiarii 
Itinerantes. After several intermediate changes in the number of the circuits it was at last 
provided by Magna Charta that two justices should be sent four times each year into each shire 
to take the assizes of novel disseizin, mort d’ancester (both real estate cases), and darrein pre- 
sentment (which was ecclesiastic), the provincial visitations of the justices. (Taylor, Origin 
and Growth of the English Constitution.) 
Excepting Somersett’s case, in which Lord Mansfield, 1760, delivered himself to this effect: 
“What ground is there for saying that the status of slavery is now recognized by the law of 
England? Villanage has long ceased to exist in England. [It had been argued that no statute 
had abolished the status of villanage.] The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, 
and every man is free who breathes it. Quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus esses—Let the 
negro be discharged.” .

of the middle class it should be called the grammar or Latin school educated 
class, for through the aid of the endowments children of the laboring class were 
constantly fitted to pass into that of the directive class. Thus was instituted a 
process of natural selection. Any ‘‘ gentleman” or member of the middle class 
might become a nobleman. The youngest son of a noble was but a gentleman, 
but the grandson of a nobleman yielded precedence to a newly made knight, and 
the dignity of knighthood was within the reach of any man who could by dili- 
gence and thrift realize a good estate or could attract notice by his valor in a bat- 
tleorasiege. There were untitled men well known to be descended from Norman 
knights who had broken the Saxon ranks at Hastings and had as crusaders scaled. 
the walls of Jerusalem, yet they bore no distinctive epithet other than that of squire 
and with no civil privileges beyond those enjoyed by every farmer and shopkeeper. 
The yeoman was not inclined to murmur at dignities to which his own children 
might rise. The grandee was not inclined to insult a class into which his own 
children must descend.! The key to success in England was personal ability 
either in battle or industry; but while providing schools for the children of the 
educated class and for the bright-minded children of the poor class, the education 
of the residuum or lower limit of the population was provided for by training in 
manual labor. The theory was, in the language of Lord Derby,’ that whenever 
any youth, however poor, had shown really exceptional ability, he might be 
enabled by some moderate pecuniary help afforded by some scholarship to go to 
the classical school. Thus the State, through private endowment, segregated out 
the bright intellects, just as before the Reformation they were picked out by the 
monks and permitted by the lord of the manor, on the payment of a fee to him, to 
desert the fields for the monastery.* 
The next nation to consider the education of the emancipated serf was France. 
In 1789 the French made the greatest effort ever made by a people to cut its -his- 
tory in twain, and they neglected nothing to render themselves unrecognizable. 
“But I have always thought,” continues M. De Tocqueville,‘ “‘that they were 
very much less successful in this singular enterprise than was fancied by others 
or by themselves.” Be this as it may, the whole system was swept away ina 
single day and 150,000 villains or serfs, in the middle age sense of the word, were 
freed and as many nobles and nearly as many priests (130,000), who together 
owned three-fourths of the land, were deprived of their means of support for the 
25,000,000 who alone had paid the taxes (the nobleman and priest not being tax- 
ables) as well as the manorial dues, were liberated from the necessity of, among 
other ‘“‘seignorial rights,” working fifty-two, more or fewer, days in the year for 
their lord (corvée), of paying on the average one-sixth of the value of their hold- 
ings when they transferred them to another (lods et vents), and of baking their 
bread and grinding their corn at the lord’s oven and mill (banalités). 
To educate the children of these emancipated agriculturists was the problem 
that the French revolutionists could not solve. Idealogues, as Napoleon called

Compare the situation in Germany in 1653, twenty-five years after the right of petition (i. e., 
of remonstrance) was affirmed by Charles I. The Elector of Brandenburg (Prussia) found it 
necessary to declare that Leibeigenshaft must subsist everywhere where it was customary, and 
that wherever there was doubt the presumption was against freedom, and further that the 
peasants must cease their complaining which was done from bad motives. (Quoted from Droy- 
sen, Knapp, the text of the edict of 1714, and Stadelmann, by Cavaignac in La Formation de la 
Prusse contemporaine.) The English law leaned to the side of freedom, and in theory at least 
presumed it.

them, schemes were not wanting. What was wanting were teachers who were 
free from the habits of mind calculated to reproduce the past from which, as 
M. de Tocqueville says, the revolutionists so desired to free themselves, and with 
themselves their country. Wild schemes were proposed, such as removing chil- 
dren of 6 years of age from their parents, as was done in ancient Sparta, and 
placing them in “houses of equality,” so that all might receive the same education 
until their twelfth year.'| Another proposition still more absurd was to modify 
the French language in such a way as to make it more in keeping with the “‘lan- 
guage of liberty.” The laws of the first French Republic regarding public edu- 
cation were of no avail, nor did the first empire, its successor, when establishing 
the system of education called the University of France, pay the least attention to 
the education of the common people, whom the Emperor probably deemed a nation 
of barbarians, to be civilized by the conscription,? as Henry VIII would educate 
them, by apprenticeship. 
The third nation to adopt a system of education as a method of social control 
and pliability was Prussia. Her second and third kings modified the system of 
Leibeigenschaft (literally ‘‘personal property”) into Erdunterthinigkeit (serf to 
the soil) and endeavored by cabinet orders in 1738 and 1749 to prevent the use 
of the whip upon the person of the agricultural peasants in order to stimulate 
their industry. The condition of the Prussian peasants may be expressed in the 
language of one who says that they were contented, ‘‘The peasant always 
belongs to somebody.” * 
In 1807, after the complete overthow of Prussia and the treaty of Tilsit, the 
minister Hardenberg was ordered by the King to draft a plan for the reconstruc- 
tion of the Prussian State. In Hardenberg’s plan it is laid down that the abolition 
of serfdom must be decreed briefly and immediately, and the laws which pre- 
vented the peasant from passing out of the peasant class and restricted office- 
holding to the nobility and relieved that body of taxation must be repealed.* 
Hardenberg being driven from office by Napoleon, the edict of emancipation was 
promulgated five days after Stein became minister, though not fully consum- 
mated until, to use Stein’s language, ‘‘ Chancellor Hardenberg’s love of innovation 
led him in 1811 to transform the relations of the landlord and peasant class, in 
which I (Stein) had no share.” But though Hardenberg’s love of innovation 
induced him to make some of the late serfs small proprietors at the expense of the 
nobility, it was Stein who, seeing the effect of the religious and patriotic spirit 
which inspired the resistance of the Spanish peasants to Napoleon,’ adopted the 
idea set forth in Fichte’s address on the necessity of national and religious educa- 
tion of the people—the conception by them of the nation as the embodiment of the 
will of God—and armed with this idea he started the war of liberation. This 
idea, being successful in freeing Germany, survived and became more and more 
the idea of the Prussian Government—the idea which must guidein preparing for 
national defense. 
INDIVIDUAL INSTINCTS AND SOCIAL UNITY. 
In the preceding matter several facts have been brought into relation in order 
to illustrate the manner in which the European world at different epochs of its 
history has sought to secure the permanency of the social institutions peculiar to

the epoch. As far as the rural, and therefore very much the larger, part of the 
population is concerned, we have found that the Roman villa was the center of 
the agricultural life, then the baronial or manorial hall, modified in England by 
the administration of itinerant courts, and finally, either compulsory apprentice- 
ship or school attendance. In the following section it is intended in the same 
brief manner to examine into certain impulses in human nature which may be 
supposed to bea source of constant danger to any social system which, through its 
government, strives to perpetuate itself by the exertion of the powers which have 
been conferred upon that government for the purpose. 
It is evident to those who consider themselves authorized by experimental study 
to speak of the emotions experienced by the child! that the first feelings that it 
manifests are expressions of wonder and fear. These emotions are the natural 
instruments of its future intellectual growth, and at an early period of its subse- 
quent mental development it is never so contented as when assured of security by 
association with its fellows and amused by a constant change in the objects pre- 
sented to its senses. The love for spectacular amusements, of engaging in games 
of chance other than those played with nature, and for bestowing and receiving 
praise does not interest us here, as our object is to inquire what motive may be 
supposed to induce an otherwise contented man to seek centers of quick exchange 
and rapid circulation of money. 
It would be difficult to find a business that as a business requires greater sagac- 
ity and physical exertion and withal more dependent on the element called luck 
than the business of farming.’ Before the invention of marine insurance probably 
the merchant's ventures were as hazardous if not more hazardous than those of 
the farmer, but insurance has not taken risks on the probabilities of the agricul- 
tural weather during six months of the year, of the destruction of the crop by 
injurious insects, or of profits which are dependent upon conditions that will hap- 
pen between the time the crop is planted and its harvest.? All these risks the 
farmer is compelled to take if he enters the world of competition, and unless he 
have a very deep insight into a futurity that is constantly becoming more ambigu- 
ous by competition, it will too frequently happen that his fertilizing material and 
his labor are expended in vain. Such, in general, seems to be the difficulty, espe- 
cially in cultivating nonvirgin soil which requires manure, and the farmer or 
the farmer’s son, finding conditions at home nonremunerative in an epoch of con- 
stantly increasing desires, at first gladly seeks to place himself under the directive 
power of those who employ labor in cities and manufacturing towns, where he 
thinks himself assured of remuneration and of relief from care, and perhaps of a 
“racare.*'4 
The facts which follow will probably sufficiently illustrate these remarks. The 
figures about to be given are for 34 cities of the Kingdom of Bavaria at the date 
of 1871. The cities range from 3,000 to 240,000, and the people in them, all of

2*Back to the land!” is a cry to which in former days I have been little disposed to listen. 
Nearly twenty years ago (1870) close intimacy with the conditions, social and economic, of rural 
life have taught me that success in agriculture, even on a small scale, demands qualities of head 
and hand and heart which, to say the least, it is quite idle to expect from a merely miscellane- 
ous company of the loafers and slummers and labor failures of town life. It is too often forgot- 
ten by the glib land reformers of our city debating clubs that the efficient agricultural laborer 
is not in reality the dull chaw-bacon sort of person shown in a comic illustrated paper, but one 
of the most highly skilled of English workmen. To expect, therefore, that the town laborer 
who has failed can readily be transformed into the rural laborer who will succeed is to expect 
miracles.—The Land and the Laborers, Rev. Charles W. Stubbs, M. A., London, 1893, Preface.

distributes yearly a sum of £4,000 ($20,000) among those farmers who insure their crops against 
hailstorms.—M. @. Mulhall on Swiss Agriculture, Report of Jrish Recess Commission.

cent, and in Prussia rye fell 13.3 per cent.

whom were born in Bavaria, were 622,988, against 4,740,185 persons born in the 
entire Kingdom. Inother words, there were 622,988 city dwellers in the 34 cities 
who were born in Bavaria and 4,117,197 persons who were also born in Bavaria 
but who continued to live in the country. We may now arrange certain facts 
regarding this city and rural population in the following form:! 
1. Showing the place of birth of the city population (622,988): Persons. 
In every 100 persons living in one of the 34 cities there were— 
(a) Born in some one of the 38¢ cities. 
(b) Born in the country-- 
2. Showing the migration from the cities as far as relates to birt: 
In every 100 persons born in one of the 34 cities there were— 
(a) Living in city in which born 
(b) Living in another Bavarian city than in which born. 
(c) Living in the country or had gone out of the Kingdom . 
8. In every 100 persons dwelling in the 34 cities there were not born within the boundaries

Thus it will be seen that only little more than half of the 622,983 persons in the 
84 cities of Bavaria were born in a city; but this is far from expressing the exact 
character of the movement from the country to the city. Let us take a country 
like France, where the birth rate is stationary. In every 100 persons in the city 
of Paris on one side and all France, including Paris, on the other we find that 
there were—

  It is immediately apparent how little impeded city life is with the very young 
or very old. We shudder at the atrocity of the Roman who ‘‘exposed ” his child; 
but city life accomplishes the same result by another process, as will now appear. 
Observe the following diagram. The spaces between the lines that run across 
the page represent intervals of ten years. The lines that run up and down the 
page represent an increase or decrease of 10 porsons in every 1,000 of the whole 
population of the city of Berlin accordingly as the line moves away from or 
toward the vertical heavy line in the middle of the diagram. Observe also that 
the starting dot and the dot at 20 on both sides the heavy line—that is, for both men 
and women—are almost in a vertical line. But seo how pinched the diagram is at 
the intervening ten-years dot. These are years of great mortality for children, 
even of country parents. On both sides of the culminating point of youthful 
vigor, the age of 20, both for the men and women side of the diagram, the move- 
ment of the line shows how attractive to the young man and woman is the life of 
the city.

To verify the foregoing interpretation of the diagram for Berlin, let us consult 
the statistics for the large city of Leipzig, remarking, as we do so, how many 
children over 5 years come into the city, and also the in-rush of those about the 
age of 20. The sum of the two ‘total columns” equals 100, likewise also the 
sum of the two ‘‘ Male” columns.

Finally, to call attention to the effect that ademand for unskilled employment at 
a center has upon the population of the country districts or other centers, the fol- 
lowing diagram prepared for M. Levasseur’s ‘‘ Demography of France,” is given: 
Pyramid showing the great excess of men 20 to 40 in the city of Paris during the 
epoch of the public reconstruction of the city under Napoleon III in 1856, and the 
unusual flatness of the male side of the pyramid just after the close of the wars 
of the first Napoleon. (Scales, every 1,000, as in preceding figure.)!

Thus having illustrated the instinct which prompts men and women to sell their 
services to the highest cash bidder though they are thereby compelled to put them- 
selves in an artificial or dependent condition—a condition, it is to be remarked, that 
is socially dangerous only when too many have placed themselves in it—it remains 
to take up the other instinct which, for the purpose of this chapter, may be sepa- 
rated out from among the passions of the human soul which foster dissatisfaction. 
This instinct is the desire for visible or objective self-effectuation or renown. 
The individual experiencing the afflatus of this pleasant but tantalizing emotion 
naturally feels a sense of repression if compelled by fortune to endure the narrow 
intellectual horizon of his native village and, especially, the few opportunities 
it offers for the gratification of his desire to unfold the possibilities with which 
nature has endowed him, either for doing good to himself or his fellows. His 
experience both in the world of concentrated directive power at business or polit- 
ical centers and in literature is either nil or is far too meager to counteract his 
thirst for the power and esteem which he thinks he may obtain in the open compe-

tition of the distant city world.! The failures of his acquaintances, if known and 
remembered, are attributed to incapacity, and the successes of others, he flatters 
himself, have been obtained by the exertion of no greater talents than his own. 
Thus the city is filled with the daring, the restless, and, in the long run, with many 
who are disappointed, and that phenomena occurs which in ancient Rome and 
now in German cities is called the proletariat. 
But the foregoing remarks, it must be admitted, are applicable only to the Latin 
and Teutonic races of Europe and America, The Slavs of Russia, at least, are 
an exception. So far from industry inducing a permanent @ain of population 
from the open country of central Russia to manufacturing centers, the very 
reverse is the case. All that industry has done is to have made the Russian 
workman anomad, During harvest time many factories close their doors, and 
those that keep them open pay wages ranged from 10 to 20 per cent higher than 
the wages paid in winter. The Russian workman is constantly oscillating 
between the factory and the farm. He prefers the factory to starvation, that is 
all. Thus it has become aphoristic to say that the Russian workman has not yet 
broken up the bundle of early instilled association of ideas that attaches him to 
the soil.? The country in Russia, as elsewhere, feeds the factory, giving it raw 
material, and, as we shall see in a moment, human hands to work that material 
up. But when it happens, as in Russia, that the flow of human beings to the 
manufactories is merely a tide that quickly ebbs and flows, no permanency can 
be given to industry which falters in an arrested development. In another part 
of this report the particulars of the Russian rural association are more fully, 
though lightly, sketched and authorities stated. 
In concluding these remarks upon the movement of population two instincts 
have been mentioned. separately as exerting more or less influence upon the 
migration of the rural population to the city; it is scarcely necessary to say that 
these instincts are not to be separated except in thought and in the case of the 
Russian whose necessities drag him to what he deems a prison. 
SOURCE OF POPULATION, 
But beside the foregoing conception of a man as a being actuated by motives 
which he follows or refuses to follow there is another conception of him as 
wholly the subject of a force without himself which he is constrained to obey. 
This conception is the outgrowth of statistical inquiry, and owes its introduction 
to M. Quetelet, who elaborated it in his essay upon man.* Any statistical presen- 
tation of the question of the rush to the city is therefore an attempt to explain 
social facts by relating them to physical causes. 
By statistics it is shown that more people are born in the country and survive 
1“T haye, certainly, alsohad always before my eyes the charms of reputation. Over and above 
the money view of the question, I wished from the beginning to be something more than a clerk 
in a post-office. To be known as somebody, to be Anthony Trollope, if it be no more, is tome 
much. The feeling is a very general one and, I think, beneficent. But I confess that my first 
object in taking to literature as a profession was that which is common to the barrister when 
he goes to the bar and to the kaker when he sets up his oven. I wished to make an income on 
which I and those belonging to me might live in comfort.” (Autobiography of Anthony 
Trollope.) 
“Mr. Rogers (one of the founders of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), working on, 
year after year, in a university that was somewhat remote and apart, came to yearn for the 
stimulus of town life and a more scientific atmosphere, and finally, at the age of 49, resigned his 
professorship at the university in order to join his brother Henry in Boston.” Pp. 833,834, Life

longer, are married at an earlier age, and have larger families than happens in 
the city. Consequently the soil is ever being called upon to support a larger 
number of persons, while the cities are unable to generate an urban-born popula- 
tion. Statements so broad require that they should be verified; therefore, 
1. More people are born in the country than in the city. This is evident to 
anyone who will trouble himself to read over the following table: !

  The table shows Saxony to be an exception. It is not only an exception to the 
diminished birth rate in the city, but it is exceptional in every way. The King- 
dom is little more than half the size of Massachusetts, has a population of 3,000,000, 
of which 20 per cent are engaged in agriculture and about 70 per cent, including 
servants, in trade or industry. Fifty-six per cent of its people live in places of 
2,000 or more inhabitants. Another exception is Norway, at least during the years 
1860-1870, and though only one-eighth of its population lived in the seven cities 
(1880) having more than 9,000 inhabitants, the same fact of an increased number 
of children born out of wedlock in urban communities is shown by the statistics, 
for in every 1,000 women from 15 to 45 years of age having children °—

2. The rural population live longer. The third and fourth columns of the next 
to the last table show the facts as regards infants under 1 year of age. Consider- 
ing the whole body of the people of France, it appears that the mortality for the 
years 1861-1865 was 26.1 in every 1,000 of the city population and 21.5 in every 
1,000 of the rural population, and for the years 1878-1882 the average deaths in the 
1,000 of city population was 24.3 and in the 1,000 of country population 20.9, or, 
to state the matter more interestingly, according to the Statistique Generale 
de France for 1861-1865 every 3,880 country people furnished 100 births to the 
population, while every 3,570 city persons furnished 100 births (there being fewer

2Certain restrictions were laid upon marriage by Canton Lucerne, in Switzerland, to wit, 
parties must not be upon the poor rates, nor likely to come upon them; nor if they are without 
money or a vocation, and they must be persons of regular habits. Consequently in Canton 
Lucerne there were fewer marriages and more bastards than in any other Canton of Switzer- 
land, though the sense of responsibility has lowered the number of early marriages. (The

  For England and Wales, Dr. Farr has endeavored to show the influence of town 
life on the death rate of the working classes 35 and over. The table shows that 
if 2,000 persons over 85 were taken (1,000 living in country and 1,000 in city) that 
fewer of the 1,000 city people would be alive at the end of fifty years than of the 
1,000 country people. For instance, if the supply from below were stopped it 
would require 3.1 years to remove all the persons over 85.in the country and only 
2.4 years to remove all those over 85 in the city. The figures follows:

alt will be recalled that in the diagram of Berlin’s population by age and the figures for 
Leipzig that 20 is the age of people who flock to cities, bringing with them the vigor of the 
country. If the city-born population only were counted, the figure would be larger. 
Finally, let us take the death-rate statistics of Scotland:

3. The people marry earlier in the rural districts. This is sufficiently well 
indicated by the column of the table on page 1005, showing the greatly increased 
number of children born to unmarried couples in the cities, despite the ready con- 
veniences of city life. But some allowance must be made for the fact that the
-P-A-G-E-1087
  AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 1007 
city is a refuge in which the mother can conceal her shame. But overmuch 
stress should not be placed on this fact, for at Munich, Vienna, and Prague one- 
half of the births are illegitimate (Von Octtingen'); at Paris, Copenhagen, and 
Brussels one-fourth; at Edinburgh and Milan one-tenth, while at London only one 
twenty-fifth (3.9 per cent) are born out of wedlock. Besides, as we are not here 
concerned with the relative sexual morality of city and country, but only with 
the increase in population, the birth in the city of children of immigrating and 
unwedded country girls is not favorable to the city birth rate any more than sub- 
sequently to its morality. In Sweden it is shown that women cease to bear chil- 
dren (or die) sooner in the city than in the country, to wit:

aThis does not bear out the contention of the text that marriages are earlier in the country 
than in the city. The birthrate of Sweden is slightly higher in towns thanin thecountry. The 
question is, of course, how many mothers were country girls and how many city-born girls. 
  Compare with the foregoing the more elaborate statistics collected by Mr. Kiaer, 
director of statistics for Norway, and based upon 133,587 births during the years 
1874, 1875, and 1876, furnished by the pastors of congregations of the Lutheran 
Church, which exclusively predominates.

woman is 20 to 24 and the man 20 to 34, there is sure to be 1 child, the chances being 51.9 in the 
100marriages. Where the woman is 25 to 29 and the man 20 to 44, the chances are 9 per cent 
fewer, namely, 43 in the 100 marriages, and so on.

4, Therural family is larger than the city family. If more children are born toa 
man and wife outside of a city than are born to a similarly connected couple in it, 
and fewer die in youth in the country than in the city, it certainly follows that 
the rural family must be larger than the city family. Bearing in mind therefore 
that increase is made by the rural family, the statistics of the registrar-general for 
England, shown on opposite page, will show how the countries of Europe have 
overcome their own death rate, that of the cities, and the loss by emigration. 
It only remains to show more particularly how it has been possible for Europe 
to furnish the United States 15,000,000 of people during the period 1816 to 1888, 
and 8,000,000 more to other parts of the world, in addition to increasing the size of 
the city population at home.

The diagram will illustrate the course of this emigration, or, as the French and 
Germans say, the fluctuation in the movement of the population. 
From these remarks upon the character of the cooperation in past times of 
intellectual deadness to produce good government and the necessities of life, 
and upon the conditions which cooperation at the present day must satisfy as to 
human aspirations and fecundity, it may appear that the United States is merely 
a vast colonial enterprise undertaken by European colonists. Such a conception is 
manifestly unjust, for pari passu with the landing of the promiscuous peoples that 
disembark on the Atlantic Seaboard a’ school system has been amplified for the 
purpose of reducing the collected individuals to a homogeneous mass. Although

all this vast tide has been poured onto the territory north of the Potomac and 
Ohio and west of the Mississippi, there yet fails to be any indication of a new ele- 
ment having been introduced into the ‘‘American” that Webster congratulated 
his audience on being in 1820. It is very doubtful if there has been as much 
change in America as there has been in England; certainly not as much as has 
taken place in Germany or in political circles in France. There is loud complaint 
of agricultural distress in America, but in the German Empire, by the report of 
the statistical bureau, nearly 5 per cent of the population, or 771,005 persons, were 
without employment in the month of December, 1895, as shown by the following 
table: 
In the German Empire there were in June, 1895, 300,000 persons out of employ- 
ment, and in December, 1895, 771,000. These persons are divided into five classes:

EFFORTS TO RELIEVE AGRICULTURAL DISTRESS BY COOPERATION, 
Cooperation in agriculture, as here discussed, is limited to the effort of producers 
to overcome the difficulties, each as an isolated farmer experiences in disposing 
profitably of his goods by joining with persons of the same trade. As such 
it is an effort toinsure by force of numbers an adequate remuneration to the 
whole company against the inequalities produced by inferior mental aptitudes 
and want of universal opportunities for making lucky hits, which, being so few, 
create a great noise, arouse spurious hopes, and eventually produce much ruin. 
It is a very difficult task to bring about the unity of many people in the transac- 
tion of business for a considerable length of time, and in the foregoing an attempt 
has been made to show how troublesome the task is by depicting the efforts of 
European society to satisfactorily distribute its population into mutually service- 
able parts, and how now it has engaged in the work of inculcating, through edu- 
cation, a spirit of unselfish devotion to the welfare of the native land, for the wel- 
fare of the nation is, separately from money making, intimately connected with 
that of the many. 
Though at the present day the self-help theories of Schulze-Delitzsch are not 
secure from sneers, nevertheless the so-called people’s banks (Vorschussvereine) 
of Germany and other countries of Europe are based upon his scheme. He, the 
so-called father of cooperation, would sweep out of existence the restrictions 
placed upon trade by the guilds or workingmen’s unions which had survived in 
Germany to his own time (1850), though in England they had been savagely 
attacked as early as the reforming era of the Tudors, and had collapsed both in 
England and in France about the era of the American Declaration of Independence. 
In 1858 Judge Hermann Schulze stated his programme to be: 
At the outset the association will have to be carried on with a certain reticence, 
because the destruction of the old trade associations is not sufficiently complete, 
the building ground is not yet so far cleared of the débris of the old system as to 
enable us to proceed with complete freedom with the work of construction. 
Besides, we have to fight with the tendency to separatism peculiar to German peo- ple, to whom the loss of isolation appears to be a loss of independence, whereas in 
truth independence is only secured by the hearty cooperation of the once isolated. 
units. Therefore, it seems best to begin with purely economic associations and
-P-A-G-E-1091
  AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 1011 
trade associations of a very limited character, which assure to members the condi- 
tions of a desirable activity of trade without as yet associating them for the car- 
rying on of the trade itself, which wili, on the contrary, be carried on by each indi- 
vidual, as formerly, for his own exclusiveadvantage. Only when the extraordinary 
power of the principle of association has thus been brought before their eyes and 
has made them sensible to and ripe for the higher steps in its application, only 
then should one gradually go on to build up with their help great cooperative 
undertakings, still guarding against overhasty and inconsiderate attempts, which 
haye generally failed.' 
As far as Judge Schulze’s plan affects agriculture, which was not its original 
object, an agricultural union not being established on his plan until 1866, it is con- 
sidered in the last report of this Bureau, at page 1239, to which may be added 
the dictum of Baron William von Humboldt: * 
Reason can not desire for man any other condition than that in which not only 
each individual enjoys the most absolute freedom of developing himself by his own 
energies in his perfect individuality, but in which even external nature is left ~ 
unfashioned by any human agency, and only receives the impress given to it by 
each individual of himself and his own free will, according to the measure of his 
wants and instincts, and restricted only by the limits of his powers and his duties. 
I.—COOPERATIVE IRRIGATION. 
The most important effort at agricultural cooperation in America is the collec- 
tion and distribution of water for the purpose of irrigation. The largest extent 
of territory artificially irrigated outside of China is the arid region of the United 
States. Irrigation there has had a checkered career. The early inhabitants of 
California had appropriated the gold found upon the public lands and in the 
streams that traversed them, and about 1865 or 1870 speculators in agricultural 
lands also appropriated the flow of water of convenient water courses. The 
riparian owners below the place where a creek or river had been turned from its 
course appealed to thecourts, which, in the famous case of Lux v. Haggin, decided 
that the English common law applied to the conditions in California, and that no 
riparian owner, at the place where the water course passed through or by his 
property, had the right to divert a whole river into a new channel for the purpose 
of raising the value of some large tracts of property he was interested in, ‘‘dear at 
5 cents, to an auction value of from $25 to $100 an acre.”? The aquatic appro- 
priators, having been shown the impropriety of their action in not consulting 
individual rights in making ‘‘ public improvements,” soon came to reason, and in 
1880 an act known as the Wright irrigation law was passed by the legislature of 
California. As this act is apparently about to become the basis of whatever 
efforts are made to redeem the 500,000,000 acres of public lands situated in that 
region of the Rocky Mountain plateau, where streams are fed in spring and 
summer by the melting snow banks on the mountain peaks, its provisions and 
history require attention. 
In 1880 State Engineer Hall, of California, stated that he had arrived at several 
conclusions, and among others— 
(1) That the State should not construct irrigation works. 
(2) That the State should establish a business basis for enterprise in irrigation 
projects. 
(8) That the cost of works of irrigation should be borne wholly by the lands to 
be irrigated in each instance. 
1 The professional organization of French agriculturists has been completed by the creation 
of unions or federations of syndicates which are designed to bind together local groups to facili- 
tate their functions and to concentrate their scattered forces, so as to lay before the public 
authorities a spontaneous and weighty expression of the wishes of the rural population.

  1012 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The Wright law was drawn in conformity with these principles, and, as a law 
based upon the common or State ownership of natural waters and upon the own- 
ership by communities of works for the storage and distribution of water for irri- 
gation purposes, is now in operation in nearly all the arid States.! 
The Wright law provides for the formation of a quasi body politic and corporate, 
to be known as an irrigation district. This body must be composed of not fewer 
than fifty (or a majority) of the owners of land susceptible of one mode of irriga- 
tion from the same source and by the same system of works. They shall present 
a petition to the county board of supervisors, setting forth their plans and present- 
ing a bond double the cost of the work they intend to do. If the board grant the 
petition and accept the bond, it shall divide the district into five divisions of equal 
size, and in each such division a director shall be elected by the people, or on being 
petitioned the board may order that three or five directors be elected by the irri- 
gation district in its entirety. The question is then voted upon by those having 
the right to vote in State elections, and if two-thirds or more of the electors vote 
for the establishment of the district, it shall be legally constituted. By a majority 
vote the district may issue bonds, which are payable 5 per cent at the expiration 
of eleven years and 1 additional per cent each subsequent year until the twentieth. 
The bonds and interest at 6 per cent are paid by an assessment upon the real prop- 
erty of the district, and all property is pledged for the payment of the bonds. 
The operation of the law was impeded. ‘It is the gloomy misfortune of Cali- 
fornia,” says Mr. John E. Bennett, ‘‘that by far the greater part of her land area 
is owned by persons who, for the most part, do not even reside within the State, 
and it was expected by the framer of the act that this class would make trouble.”? 
The anticipation of trouble was realized in the case of a woman, a nonresident 
land owner, who in 1894 brought suit against the Fallbrook Irrigation Company 
in the United States courts on a question as to the right of the State to organize 
an irrigation district, and the decision was in the plaintiff’s favor; that is, she 
could not be taxed through her land. This decision was overruled by the Supreme 
Court of the United States in the latter part of 1896, and the Wright law stands. 
IIl.—JOINT INTEREST IN LAND OF FARMERS AND LANDLORDS. 
There is another form of what may be called physical necessity of cooperating 
(the smallness of an element being considered in regard to the largeness of the 
demand for it) and that is cooperation in cultivating land belonging to a person 
who may or may not be himself a cooperator in cultivating that land. Thus in 
China, which is essentially an agricultural community of over 400,000,000 of people, 
the land is owned by the State, which rents it at a uniform figure, irrespective of 
the improvement made by the farmer who controls and transmits his holding. In 
Great Britain there is the landlord-and-tenant class of organization, which in Ire- 
land has produced, it is generally conceded, most lamentable results, for there 
“ the insecurity of the tenant’s possession gave him the alternative either of doing 
nothing to better his farm or of bettering his farm without bettering himself.* 
But the reformation of the Irish system was effected by the application in 1870 of 
the tenant-right system, which had grown up in the Province of Ulster, to the 
other three provinces of the island. This tenant right of Ulster gave a fixity of 
tenure to the farmer and also an interest in the land he cultivated, which interest 
he could sell to another who wished to take his place. The extension of this local 
custom to the whole of Ireland was as great an innovation in English legislation 
as was Hardenberg’s interference with the Prussian system of land holding at the

beginning of the century, the prostrated condition of the country to be benefited 
seemingly leaving no option to the legislator. In this way there is recognized a 
certain ownership on the part of the tenant as well as on that of the landlord,'and 
the condition of the middle ages is restored, but in favor of the tenant, who is a 
freeman and is a cooperator with the landlord in possessing the soil and no more 
ah operator—operaius, as the serf was called in medieval Latin. 
In England several attempts have been made by landowners to experiment in 
the line attempted by the Government of Mr. Gladstone in 1870 and 1880. The 
earliest and most successful of these is known as the cooperative farms at Assing- 
ton. In 1830, fourteen years before the commencement of the enterprise of the 
Rochdale pioneers, the idea suggested itself to a Suffolk squire (Mr. Gurdon, of 
Assington Hall) that he would attempt to apply, by way of experiment, the prin- 
ciple of cooperation or copartnership to a farm; selecting 60 acres of land of 
medium quality, furnished with a rough but not unsuitable homestead, he formed 
his little company of shareholders, all of them taken from the class of farm labor- 
ers, to which he gave the name of the Assington Cooperative Agricultural Society. 
The number of the original shareholders was 15, who put $15 a piece into the con- 
cern by way of subscribed capital; the landlord, to give his bantling a chance for 
life,? liberally advanced to the cooperators the sum of $2,000, without interest on 
loan. The society grew and prospered. The land occupied increased from 60 
acres to 130, and the number of shareholders was enlarged from 15 to 21. The 
present value of the shares is, to use the language of the bailiff (manager), ‘all 
of $250.” All years have not been equally remunerative, but there has not been 
any one since the concern started without some little matter to divide. The com- 
pany haye repaid the landlord all the borrowed money, and for all the stock and 
implements on the farm, which are now their own. The rent of the land is (in 
1867) $1,000a year, the company paying tithes, rates,and taxes. The land is farmed 
on the four-course system, and ordinarily employs five men and two or three boys. 
The members (who must be laborers of the parish) are not bound to work upon 
the farm, but it is understood that if a cooperator is out of work elsewhere he has 
aclaim to employment before any other man. When a cooperator works on the 
farm, he is paid wages at the usual rate, and if he be inefficient there is no scruple 
about discharging him. The affairs of the concern are managed by a committee 
of four, but the practical direction of the farm rests with the bailiff, himself a 
cooperator as well. Illiteracy is no bar to serving on the committee, yet ifa man 
be not thought sufficiently intelligent he will be refused when his turn comes. 
The first experiment apparently succeeded so well that in 1854 Mr. Gurdon started 
a second, which was equally successful as the first until the late strain of bad 
seasons impaired, if not destroyed, its prosperity. 
Ill. COOPERATION IN PRODUCTION. 
Having thus exhibited two forms of agricultural cooperation to obtain elements 
which are limited in supply by nature (being land and water) we may turn to the 
consideration of cooperation in agriculture to provide at remunerative prices 
those articles which are only limited by the satisfaction of the necessities of 
human existence.*

reduce the cost of insuring their buildings, but of these there is no occasion here to speak.

  1014 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
«However various the circumstances of the countries of the Continent of 
Europe,” says the report of a recent committee for the improvement of the con- 
dition of agriculture in Ireland, “‘it is a striking fact that we find the same main 
principles adopted by them all in promoting agriculture, which may be summed 
up in three words,—organization, representation, education.” By organization 
the committee mean what is here called cooperation and, as they observe, the 
subject is receiving wide attention. The following is a compilation of reports 
and statements that the organization of this cooperation has brought out. 
(a) ECCENTRIC ASSOCIATIONS. 
Societies for the purpose of cooperation in agriculture must be separated from 
those which in the past have owed their structure either to a deep religious feel- 
ing, so noticeable in rural communities, or to a disgust with the conventions of 
middle-class life; for the people who lay the ground plan of such associations are 
only content when they have isolated their converts from the insufficiently religi- 
ous world or from the forms current in polite society. Of societies of this descrip- 
tion it is not the intention to speak, as we are wholly concerned with persons 
(possibly mere abstractions) who are willing from pure business motives to volun- 
tarily form a pool or trust for their own benefit by selling in the dearest market 
and buying in the cheapest. Such an object is in no way connected with religious 
worship and can not be expected to be cemented by religious belief. It is a mere 
matter of business interest and must be upheld by the ability of each cooperator 
to see his own financial good or safety bound up with that of his fellow cooper- 
ators, to be contented with nonspeculative profits and mediocrity, and to be will- 
ing to work. All these requisites are excessively trying to the nervous system, as 
was pointed out several centuries ago in a panegyric on the downfall of the little 
industrial republics of Italy by Machiavelli.' 
(b) Tam SYNDICATES OF FRANCE FOR PURCHASING MANURE AND FOR MAKING BUTTER AND 
CHEESE. 
Societies for the aid of agriculture may be divided into three classes—for buy- 
ing, for selling, and for growing for sale, or for any two or all of these purposes. 
To these must be added the associations for procuring credit already spoken of 
in Chapter XXVI of the last report of this Bureau. 
The strongest body of agricultural cooperating societies is that of France. They 
are called by a name well-known in America, syndicates, ‘‘Syndicats agricoles,” 
or, in English, agricultural trusts. What is said of these syndicates is merely an 
abridgment of what is so well compiled by M. le compte de Rocquigny in his ‘‘La 
cooperation de production dans l’agriculture,” under which he includes the pur- 
chase of fertilizers and machinery, the rearing of animals, and the sale of the pro- 
ductions of the farm. 4 
The 1,500 agricultural trusts of France are founded on the general law of 1884, 
which allows persons working at the same trade or calling to associate freely for 
the study and the protection of their economic, industrial, commercial, and pro- 
fessional interests. Some of these societies embrace a whole department (county?), 
others limit their activity toa township or a parish. The syndicate of agricul- 
turists of Vicune, at Poitiers, and several others have from 8,000 to 10,000 
adherents. It is estimated that 200 agricultural syndicates have over 1,000 mem- 
bers each, and that the actual total of syndicated agriculturists is about 600,000. 
The chief object of agricultural syndicates is the study and protection of economic 
agricultural interests, which means not only the general welfare of agriculture, 
  
1The Prince, cf. Gray's ode to “Vicissitude:” 
““Mark proud ambition’s march sublime 
Up to Power’s meridian height, 
While pale-eyed envy sees him climb 
And sickens at the sight.”
-P-A-G-E-1095
  AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 1015 
but also the special interests common to the members of each association. ‘‘The 
individual efforts of isolated husbandmen, especially if they be small cultivators, 
are powerless to put down the coalition of adverse interests and to insure them- 
selves a just remuneration for their labor,” says M. Rocquigny. It would thus 
appear that the 600,000 syndicated farmers in France are united for regulating the 
course of business in that country with no other check than the moderation of 
their leaders and the opposition of other trade combinations similarly portentous 
in numbers. 
The soil of Europe is far from being a virgin soil. It is said that the Chinese in 
their garden farming neither impoverish the soil nor buy artificial fertilizers. It 
is not so in France, and the most serious outlay of syndicate money is for nitrog- 
enous, potassic, or phosphatic fertilizers. The syndicate of Vienne, for instance, 
buys annually about $200,000 worth, and so on. The,influence of the syndicates 
on the market has been such that ‘‘phosphatic manures, for instance, have fallen 
from 40 to 50 per cent,” if produced in France, though the price of imported min- 
eral manures has not been affected. To this reduction of the price of home- 
manufactured fertilizers niust be added the enhanced value of the stuff which 
was formerly abominably adulterated. Well may M. de Rocquigny say that ‘the 
monopoly of those manures was in the hands of traders and agents not always 
over scrupulous, who took advantage of the ignorance of the peasants to make 
them pay dearly (say four times the value?) for manures which were wanting in 
fertilizing power.” French manufacturers, it is said, find compensation for 
honesty and limited profits in a sale increased threefold. 
The second great source of expenditure of the agricultural syndicates of France 
is the purchase of machines to be loaned or hired. These are generally plows 
(either ordinary or subsoiling), fertilizer distributers, seeding machines, horse hoes, 
presses, rollers, thrashers, fodder cutters, etc. These instruments are placed in 
the depots where the fertilizer is stored, and are loaned out at a small charge or 
even free of charge to the members who desire to use them. This feature is prob- 
ably one of the great causes of the growth of the syndicates. The thrashing 
machines are hired out at from 50 cents to $1 a day; in other cases the grain is 
drawn to the place where the machine is kept and there thrashed, at a cost of 5 
cents a 100 pounds, or for 2} or 5 cents a hectoliter, according as the syndicate or 
the owner does the work, and so on for the other instruments. The syndicates of 
the vine-growing districts provide for their ‘‘adherents” apparatus for wine mak- 
ing on scientific principles, that would be utterly beyond the purse of small cul- 
turists. Sometimes large cultivators combine to procure steam-power-moyed 
machines, and sometimes contracts are made with individual owners of machines 
to do the work for the members of the syndicates at reduced rates. 
There is an effort to secure mutual action among these syndicates. For example, 
the vineyards destroyed by the phylloxera are best rehabilitated by replanting 
them with native American grapevines. These were held at such high prices and 
so much fraud practiced that about one hundred syndicates started nurseries of 
their own to supply their members either gratuitously or at a smaller price than 
the vines could be purchased in the market. Thus, the Syndicat Agricole et 
Viticole de Jujuneux was at first simply a group of ninety-seven vine growers 
who cultivated for their common benefit a piece of ground planted with American 
vines, in order to replant their individual vineyards with grafted stock (Vitis 
vinefera on the American stock). In 1893 this association became a professional 
syndicate, and 150,000 plants grafted by professional persons were distributed in 
November, 1894. And so on for irrigation, but this last is nothing to be compared 
to what has been spoken of as done under the Wright law a few pages back. 
A very few syndicates, e. g., the Vine Growers’ Association, are also used as a 
means of alleviating distress. For instance, if a member of the syndicate of 
Thenay falls ill or is hurt, or becomes infirm (empéché par maladie, blessure, ou  
-P-A-G-E-1096
  
  1016 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
infirmité), the active members are, either themselves or by another, obliged to do 
the necessary work upon his vines, according to the order of the “bureau.” Then, 
again, a very few syndicates are “‘ benevolent societies,” as we call them in Amer- 
ica, All these syndicates are open to anybody, or, as the French say, “‘mixed.” 
Proprietors, farmers who rent, farmers on shares (métayers), and laborers all may 
belong; but the fact is that it is rare to find a laborer belonging to the syndicate. 
A certain number of syndicates only admit proprietors, and a certain number of 
syndicates are organized by the laborers to prevent the members of the other syndi- 
cates from beating them down to starvation wages and imposing long hours of labor. 
Before passing to the subject of cattle raising a word must be said of a very 
remarkable function, for which a few syndicates have been formed. The Maybug 
(Henneton or Melolonia vulgaris) is a particularly unwelcome visitor in France. 
The larva of this insect lives upon the roots of plants, and in the spring of the 
third year comes forth as a beetle. When we find in the canton of Gorrona 
“syndicat de hannetonnage,” we understand that it is no more a producing but 
a destroying syndicate. One of the 16 syndicates for exterminating hannetons 
killed 300,000 pounds of the bugs (?)' in 1889, and 250,000 pounds in 1892. The 
destructive and collective inclinations of school children are utilized in this work 
of prophylacticagricuiture. There are also half a dozen syndicates for the destruc- 
tion of harmful insects, one especially concentrating itself upon ‘‘the fly Lyda, 
which ravages fruit trees,” and there are 20 syndicates ‘‘for the defense of grape 
vines against frosts” by means of ‘‘artificial clouds,” smoke, etc. Itis understood 
that some vine-growing syndicates have made arrangements whereby they can 
insure themselves against late spring frosts. 
There are quite a number of French societies for the rearing of cattle, but that 
subject will be more fully spoken of under Switzerland’s contribution to coopera- 
tion where cooperative cattle breeding is at its highest development, as will appear. 
The other great object of cooperative production in France is dairying. Thisis 
placed, by M. de Rocquigny under the head of ‘‘ the industrial transformation of 
products,” the transformation of grass into flesh and of scrub stock into good 
grades being considered a natural rather than an industrialoperation. But, how- 
ever it may be properly classified, it is the world over the most successful form of 
agricultural cooperation. Listen to M. de Rocquigny’s eulogy of that inesti- 
mable friend of the farmer, the cow: ‘‘In the face of the continuance of the 
depreciation of the value of every agricultural product cattle have remained the 
great resource of our cultivators. The bovine race especially, thanks to the merit 
of our native races, and thanks to our care for them, gives us products that are 
constantly increasing in value.” In his Milk Industries, Professor Lézé, an 
authority on this subject, remarks that a farm producing 100 quarts (100 liters) 
of milk should get about 6 pounds (3 kilograms) of butter, representing a value 
of $1.20 (6 francs), not taking account of the value of the manipulation and trans- 
portation to market. On the other hand, if the 100 liters be sold immediately, a 
return of $1.60 (8 francs) is secured and the labor and transportation saved. For- 
tunate is it, then, says M. de Rocquigny, that by ‘‘ collective fabrication ” a farmer 
may raise the value of his milk from $2 to $2.40 for each 100 quarts fabricated. 
This ‘‘collective fabrication” or ‘‘ cooperation in production” has particular refer- 
ence to the industrial treatment of milk put in common by the cooperators and 
assures the best utilization of it possible. The object of this branch of French 
cooperation is butter and cheese making at a creamery. 
The organization of a cooperative dairy is very simple. A group of proprietors 
having the required number of cattle agree to furnish all the milk from their 
cows to a proposed establishment, which is built and furnished by the aid of 
  
_ 1“ The cool nights of spring render this beetle rather torpid and it can be collected in great 
numbers.”—Gustave Henzé, Art. Hanneton.

money either borrowed or subscribed by the associated parties. It is conducted 
by a manager and & council of administration, who are assisted by a commission 
of control (executive committee). The receipts from the sale of butter pay for 
the milk used after taking out a part of the receipts to cover the general expenses 
and sinking fund. The value of the milk delivered by each cooperator is deter- 
mined according to the monthly sales of butter, which is a rigorous application 
of the cooperative principle. In 1888 there were two cooperative dairies in France, 
and in 1896 there were nearly one hundred. 
The great center of butter-making factories is in the region of the Charantes 
and Poitou, a region much devastated by the phylloxera. The funds necessary to 
the organization of a factory (purchase of the land, buildings, and machinery) are 
about $8,000 or $10,000 for an average-sized dairy. Some societies do not have 
piggeries attached, and some allow their members to make their own butter. 
The factories sell the butter through the regular channels of middlemen, gener- 
ally auctioneers. They are not ‘‘syndicated” for selling, but only for producing. 
The butter thus sold in Paris is known as ‘“‘ beurre des Charantes” and amounted 
to about 6,384,362 pounds in 1898, according to the city statistics. The amounts 
obtained from the sales are daily turned in to the banks of the Société Générale, 
which credit the departmental agencies in the neighborhood of the factory. The 
dairies too distant from such agencies of the Société Générale are addressed weekly 
by aletter of exchange. The price obtained varies from 32 cents, or even 386 cents, 
a pound in winter to 18 cents or even less insummer. The average is generally 
about 25 cents.a pound the year round. The packages are about 22 pounds (10 
kilograms), plus 200 grams for good weight. The expense of transportation, 
including the octroi (cost of being allowed to come into the city), and of selling 
is not quite 4 cents a pound. 
It is considered that a cooperative dairy should be able at the lowest to count 
on about 2,000 quarts (liters) of milk a day. The ordinary general expenses— 
salaries, coal, oil, packing cloth, etc., and taxes, insurance, transportation, care of 
material, etc.—are covered by a reserve of from 9 to 15 per cent, derived from the 
sale of the butter. The director rarely receives more than $200 a year, and 
must give bond and does not ‘‘ participate in the benefits.” Other employees are 
an engine driver (mécanicien) and one, two, or three butter makers, who receive 
from $120 to $240 per year, according to their ability and the value of labor in the 
locality. These positions, which are very much sought after, are sometimes put 
in “adjudication,” a method not very proper to guarantee ability in those who 
get the position in that way, so itis said. 
The milk is collected at the home of the cooperator by those who contract 
(entrepreneurs) to do that work. They are called laitiers or tourne-lait, and give 
bond and receive pay according to the distance. Some of the associations have 
gone into the business of insuring cows. 
Butter making is one form of dairying, cheese making is another. The cheese 
factory, which the French call by the name of ‘‘fruitery,” is the oldest form of 
agricultural cooperation, for it was instituted by the peasants dwelling in the 
Alps as early as the thirteenth century. “At first the cheese maker went around 
with his outfit to each member of the society, very much as the owner of a reap- 
ing or thrashing machine puts himself and his apparatus at the service of a num- 
per of farmers for ‘‘a valuable consideration.” But subsequently this ‘‘tacite 
association,” as M. de Rocquigny calls it, was made a de facto society, governed 
by general laws. The cheese maker was installed in a house, the manufacturing 
became ‘‘sedentary,” and was regulated by a council. ‘‘In our day,” continues 
M. de Rocquigny, ‘‘ the organization of the cheese factories has been greatly 
improved,” This apparently has been done by means of instruction, and the fol- 
lowing account of a cheese-making school will be of interest: 
*‘Cheese-making schools,” says M. Friant, their inspector, in the report upon  
-P-A-G-E-1098
  1018 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
agricultural instruction in France, ‘‘are establishments rationally organized in 
which students are admitted to perform all work relative to the utilization of 
milk in a scientific manner.” These schools are managed at the risk and peril 
of the cheese-making association. The course is limited to one year, and the 
instruction is free; but each school has two fellowships of $80 [each?]. The State 
pays the professors, and the association meets the cost of the other necessities of 
the school. The theoretical instruction comprises elementary instruction and 
instruction in the chemistry and industry of milk and animal physiology. This 
theoretical instruction consumes eight hours a week, two for the common-school 
studies, six for the technical. The practical instruction is the doing daily the 
work of the cheese factory—making cheese and butter, care of the beehives and 
piggeries. In addition to this, there is an analysis of milk oncea week. There are 
eight of these schools in France, with two exceptions founded since 1888. The 
cheese-making factories number 1,983, more or fewer. The sphere of activity of 
these cheese-making (always taking the word ‘‘fruitiére” in its dictionary mean- 
ing as a mere synonym for ‘“‘fromagerie”) syndicates may be illustrated in the 
case of the syndicate of the cheese-making factories of the Jura (mountains), of 
which M. le Marquis de Froissard is president. This is truly a professional asso- 
ciation of cheese makers. The object of the association is to protect the common 
interests of the makers of Gruyére cheese, to see that good cheese makers are 
selected for the factories, to guard against the jockeying of buyers who wish to 
get rid of their contracts when the market is falling, to prevent frauds on the 
part of the cheese makers, to audit accounts, etc. 
Other syndicates ‘‘of production” are not wanting. There are syndicates for 
vinification (making wine), for panification (baking bread), grinding cereals, dis- 
tilling alcohol, making starch, fabricating olive oil, putting up preserves, and mak- 
ing perfumery, the object being to prevent the transformation of raw material 
into a less raw material by completely manufacturing it at home, thus minimizing 
at least one of the dithculties that statisticians haye in computing the ‘‘ wealth of 
a country.” 
The sale of agricultural products is considered by M. de Rocquigny as the last 
process of agricultural production, and upon this subject he makes these remarks: 
The agricultural syndicates very generally have proposed to themselves the 
accomplishment of the sale of their products just as they have brought about 
cooperation in the purchase of fertilizers, etc. The programme has been to pre- 
vent the sale of products below the cost of production and to prevent the artificial 
depreciation of the market. The means to accomplish this are le groupement des 
offres and the guaranty of authenticity, by opening new markets, by the suppres- 
sion of useless middlemen, and by the current of direct transactions thus insti- 
tuted between the producer and the consumer. But the great difficulties in the 
way have been recognized. The syndicate is not able to operate commercially, 
to make and receive binding propositions, to contract for actual delivery (traiter 
pour des disponsibilités assurées). Its réle is limited to that of a bureau of infor- 
mation for the buyer and the seller. From this arose the idea of annexing to the 
syndicates certain institutions organized in such a fashion that they may accom- 
plish what the syndicates can not. 
As an agency constituted in this way seems to have the power of subjecting the 
consumer of agricultural products to the same burdens that the manufacturers of 
fertilizers in France subject the farmers, and against which combinations the farm- 
ers protested, as related on page 1015, no particular mention can be made of it here. 
(c) THE OBJECT, ORGANIZATION, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CATTLE-RAISING SOCIETIES OF 
BERNE, SWITZERLAND. 
The authority consulted in compiling the following matter is Mr. J. von Wat- 
tenwyl-Elfenau, the president of the society whose work is now to be considered.' 
1The Bureau is indebted to Mr. Eugene Germain, United States consul at Zurich, for many 
documents concerning and illustrations of the cattle raised by this association.
-P-A-G-E-1099
  AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 1019 
Mr. von Wattenwyl in his report, the first of the kind, to the united Bernese 
societies, makes these observations: 
If we examine the history of agriculture, we find an extraordinarily long-drawn- 
out development.. The son inherited the methods as wellas the farm of his father. 
For generations there was scarcely a change. Thus it was for our time that a 
change should be made. A general and increasing tendency to intensive culture 
has spread over Europe. A better acquaintance with the laws of nature and 
especially the development of competition have completely revolutionized agricul- 
tural production. The ease with which grain can be transported caused its culti- 
vation to be neglected in populous Europe and to take colossal development on the 
broad steppes of America, Russia, and Hungary, which have thus become the 
granaries of Europe. But the population of Europe continued to increase and 
industry grow, and as the channels of commerce increased it became necessary for 
agriculture to produce such crops as would pay a higher interest on capital and 
labor. From this necessity there arose in Switzerland the business of milk farm- 
ing (Milchwirtschaft), which is dominated by the idea of the highest possible 
intensive production of fodder and likewise the highest possible intensive valua- 
tion of milk (Sie gipfelt in einer méglichst intensiven Erzetigung von Futter und 
in einer méglichst mtensiven Verwertung der Milch). This is possible to those 
living near cities, but to others less favorably situated cheese making and con- 
densed-milk manufactories were more remunerative. But there is a fourth 
means, and that is the rearing of cattle, the really original source of what may 
be called an intensive milk supply. 
Such is the reasoning of the originator of the Bernese societies. There are now 
at least 184 of these associations inSwitzerland. Mr. von Wattenwyl has no scru- 
ples about expressing his opinion as to the amount of personal freedom to be 
accorded to the members of a cooperative society for raising cattle. In organizing 
such a society the fundamental idea which must permeate the whole body of mem- 
bers is that the will of each individual must be unconditionally subordinated to 
the will of the organization in those matters where the object of the organization, 
and consequently its interests, are at stake. Nevertheless the organization must 
limit its interference with the personal freedom of the members to the most neces- 
sary occasions. ‘It scarcely needs to be pointed out,” says Mr. Wattenwy], ‘that 
the formation of a cooperative cattle-raising society will not instantly put a stop 
to foreign competition in the grain market, nor will it create a fiourishing milk 
industry. The organization as a whole must closely cling to this object: Improve- 
ment of the stock gradually but intensively.” In short, the contention is this: The 
Swiss Alps produce the best cattle of Europe. Let them be purchased by foreign- 
ers, still the breed of Alpine cattle will degenerate upon the plains of Austria, Ger- 
many, and France, and it will be necessary to come to Switzerland, as in the 
beginning, to procure the blood that is made by the grasses of the elevated valleys 
and slopes of that precipitous land. 
The Berne Cattle-Raising Association, for rearing spotted cattle, is composed of 
Swiss citizens, who associate themselves for the purpose of protecting and advanc- 
ing their interests in every particular (nach allen Seiten hin), both at home and 
abroad, and especially for improving the business of cattle raising. Its authorities 
are an assembly of representatives and a board of directors, which bodies together 
elect a president and other directors, who, in addition to the president, are a vice- 
president, a treasurer, and two members. In addition to these it appears that 
there is a committee of experts, composed of three members and two assistants, 
chosen from among the most experienced of the members, who are compelled to 
act when chosen. This committee selects and buys the bulls and passes upon their 
register. They also go round inspecting the animals registered to see if they are 
being properly cared for.

(d) GENERAL STATEMENT OF COOPERATION IN GERMANY.! 
Cooperationists in Germany are divided into two parties; one, organized under the 
name of ‘‘Federal Union of German Industrial and Economic Societies” (Allge- 
meiner Verband deutscher Erwerbs- und Wirthschaftsgenossenschaften), and 
the other under the name of ‘‘ Union of Rural Associations of Germany” (Gener- 
alanwaltschafts Verband lindlicher Genossenschaften fiir Deutschland). The 
difference between them is that the first follows the ideas of Schultze-Delitzsch and 
the other those of Raiffeisen, as explained at pages 1239-1241 of the report preced- 
ing this. 
The aims of the cooperators on the Schultze system are these: The furtherance 
of cooperation in general, the development of the constitution and the institution 
of allied societies, the protection of common interests by united efforts and 
resources, the formation of mutual business relations between societies. In fact, 
the “‘union” is a means for the interchange of the experience gained, for counsel 
and help in any case of attack or difficulty which may embarrass individual socie- 
ties, for the powerful union of their strength, for the prosecution and maintenance 
of common interests, for defense and unity in the face of threatening situations 
and dangers, for the formation, finally, of business relations among its members. 
The union defends the interests of associations publicly, by word and in writing, 
to an extent which makes even associations not affiliated to benefit by its action. 
The business of the union is directed by the ‘‘Anwalt,” who is elected by the asso- 
ciations at their annual congress. The most powerful attack made upon this 
organization was made by Ferdinand Lassalle, who demanded the founding of 
“productive societies” by state help. The union is founded on the idea of self- 
help and a sort of general pooling of the individual interests of the insignificant, 
in a financial sense, members of the community. 
The Reichstag—the federal legislature of the German Empire, corresponding to 
our Federal Congress—has taken upon itself (in 1889) to regulate these societies, 
which were thereafter required every two years to submit their accounts and 
records to the scrutiny of an independent and expert auditor. At this point we 
must leave these associations and the political management and oversight of their 
affairs and examine briefly into an outgrowth of another organization of them on 
the Schultze system, called the Federal Union of German Agricultural Societies 
(Allgemeiner Verband deutscher landwirthschaftlicher Genossenschaften), which 
must be kept separate from the Raiffeisen combination of societies, whose name 
amounts to the same thing. Perhaps it will aid to separate if a table be made of 
membership, etc., of each.

It will be seen that there is quite a difference between the amount of the reserve 
fund. In the Raiffeisen societies it is not quite $1 to a member; in the Schultze 
societies it is over $5. The paid-up-share capital indicates a like difference. In

Milk was supplied to members at a slight reduction from market price. 
The societies on the Raiffeisen idea of decentralized self-help seem rather to look 
to the State (at least, so it is charged by Mr. Cruger, of the rival or Schultze con- 
cerns') for financial encouragement where such societies are feeble, or where the 
State wants them to increase, as in Switzerland and Belgium.? But there is 
another cause, according to the Belgium minister of agriculture, that has pro- 
moted the increase of the Raiffeisen banks. The clergy in central Europe, both 
Lutheran and Catholic, have worked for them, and in 1890 the Catholic Congress 
pronounced warmly in their favor, and that church gained control in Italy of a 
system of Raiffeisen banks started by Sig. Wollemborg, or, to use the words of 
Sig. Enea Cavalieri, of Italy (a Schultzian), ‘‘ Wrested from the hands of Wol- 
lemborg the banner of the rural banks.”* Sig. Wollemborg had started them. 
Mr. Mulhall adduces another reason for the progress of these associations or “rural 
banks:” ‘‘ Belgians have not been slow to perceive that their money is turned to 
better account in this matter under their own eyes than by investing it in remote 
securities.” 
Weare here particularly concerned with a feature of the Raiffeisen system in 
Germany that is of a more distinctly ‘‘ cooperative” cast than association for pro- 
curing credit—that is to say, cooperation more in line with the meaning of that word. 
as used in this present report. Connected with the central Raiffeisen association 
or union there is a trading firm which negotiates the common purchase of coal, 
feeding stuffs, manures, machinery, etc., and which recently has ‘‘ with very 
great success,” begun to grapple with the difficult problem of common sales of 
agricultural produce. That trading firm is, like the central bank, a joint stock 
concern, but with very few shareholders. Independently of the purchases made 
directly by local associations, this trading firm has in the last two years purchased 
for and supplied at cheap prices to the union 22,681 tons of artificial manure, 4,707 
tons feeding stuffs, 119 tons seeds, 5,430 “trucks” of coal, and about $13,000 worth 
of machinery; in all, representing about $730,000 worth of goods. Several local 
centers have put up common warehouses for the storage of agricultural produce 
and have (independently?) succeeded in negotiating common sales. The mere 
organization for distributive purposes, existing as a matter of course in the union, 
has been found to provide facilities for the disposal of produce—potatoes, vine 
poles, hops, etc.—in localities where such articles happen to be wanted. ‘‘ The 
movement is still in its infancy,” says Director Cremer.

(e) THE “ALLOTMENT SYSTEM” OF ENGLAND. 
While St. Simon, in 1817, was applying the English doctrine of utilitarianism to 
take the place of Locke’s social compact idea, urging, in his book on “ Industry,” 
that man is a social being so long as his interests arecommon with that of others, 
and that industry is the cementing principle of society, Robert Owen was wonder- 
ing how much benefit his 2,000 hands received from the wealth that he and his 
partner, Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, were making from the 
machinery used in their factories at New Lanark. To Mr. Owen, the great man- 
ufacturer, is due the idea contained in the dictum that the users of machinery are 
growing rich while the workmen are growing poor, and the term socialism, while 
the science of sociology apparently is an outcome of the theory of the Count de 
St. Simon, to say nothing of his connection with positivism and the worship of 
humanity as developed in the works of M. August Compte. Owen’s attempt at 
forming a cooperative settlement at New Harmony, in Indiana, failed, and so did 
his movement in England, and after saying that it was necessary to find some legal 
means of putting farmers on equality with merchants, manufacturers, and others 
in regard to borrowing money, and that the industrial class (including agricul- 
turists) was the only useful class, the whole St. Simonean movement went down 
in the overthrow of the second French Republic, in 1848. To both men is due the 
honor of calling attention to the survival of the fittest in industry, which is now 
as much debated as Darwinism was in 1860. But instead of evolution we now 
have sociology. 
We have seen that the English Government (that Government so often 
reproached with laisser faire) began a huge system of the support of the poor 
about the beginning of the seventeenth century (1601), and it was not slow to 
take up the cause of the agricultural laborer at the beginning of the nineteenth, 
when it became necessary to correct the evil of pauperizing the whole lower stra- 
tum of the agricultural population on one side and depriving it of commons on 
the other. The remedy proposed to keep this class of cottagers ‘‘ buoyant and 
industrious” was allotments of small pieces of land to the cottages rented by the 
agricultural laborer. The practical Cobbett, in his Rural Rides, notices the ben- 
efit to the laborers of good gardens, especially in the southern counties:! ‘‘ There 
you see that most interesting of all objects, that which is such an honor to Eng- 
land, and that which distinguishes it from all the rest of the world, namely, those 
neatly kept and productive little gardens round the laborers’ homes, which are 
seldom unornamented with more or less of flowers. We have only to look at these 
gardens to know what sort of people English laborers are.” In 1819 an act of 
Parliament empowered the church wardens and overseers of any parish to pur- 
chase or take on lease any suitable portion of land and to let such portion of land 
“to any poor and industrious inhabitant of the parish,” to be occupied and culti- 
vated on his own account; and in 1843 a committee of the House of Commons 
reported very favorably upon the system, and in introducing a bill into the House 
of Commons Mr. Cowper remarked that ‘‘since 1800 no fewer than 2,000 inclosures 
of commons (public land) had passed and tho’ the acreage was not set forth in 
the returns, it must form no inconsiderable portion of the land of the country. 
Besides this, the consolidation of small farms so extensively adopted during the 
war with Napoleon had contributed to deprive the laboring man of his opportuni- 
ties of holding land. The breaking up of the system of leasing for life also had 
the same tendency. The result of the combined causes was that, until the allot- 
ment system was revived, the English laborer was severed from all connection 
1 Quotations are taken from the fourth edition of Rev. C. W. Stubb's The Land and the Labor- 
ers; Facts and Experiments in College Farming and Cooperative Agriculture, London, 1893; His- 
tory of the Allotment System.

with the land.” What Mr. Cowper particularly valued in the idea of the allotment 
system was the moral effect upon the holder. The management of a garden was 
an important ingredient in his happiness. But he afterwards added that at least 
a generation must pass before there would be room for the idea. In 1887 an act 
was passed called the allotments act. There were in 1890, 455,005 allotments. The 
main provision of the act is that any six registered parliamentary electors or rate- 
payers living in the district in the case of towns, or living in any parish of a 
union in case of the country, may bring the question of the need for allotments 
before the sanitary authority, which, in rural places, is the board of guardians. 
If the sanitary authority are of opinion that there is a demand for allotments and 
that they can not be got on reasonable terms by voluntary arrangements they are 
directed, by purchase or hire, to get suitable land and to let it in allotments to 
persons belonging to the laboring population. Public meetings may be held upon 
the subject. The act does not apply to shopkeepers, assistants, or clerks. In this 
connection the account of an experiment by Mr. Stubbs, a rector of Buckingham- 
shire, England, may be of interest: 
At the close of the year 1873 [says the vicar| I divided a portion of my glebe land 
[land under his control as rector], 22 acres, into half-acre allotments, among my 
parishioners, at an annual rental of 66 shillings [$16.50] an acre. I retained two 
lots—that is, 1 acre—in my own hands. I have worked it on exactly the same 
method of husbandry as that of the remaining allotments. That is to say, as it 
was heavy clay land, not over well drained, but sloping for the most part to the 
south and west, the kind of crops we grow are wheat, beans, oats, potatoes, 
mangel-wurzel, carrots, garden vegetables, etc. Now, being interested in col- 
lecting what facts I could as to the results to be gained from small as.opposed 
to large culture, I have kept accurate accounts during some years of the outgoings 
and incomings on my i-acre farm, and this has been the result: In the last six 
years of agricultural depression (1878-1884) my net profit on the acre, after allow- 
ing fully for rent [$16.50] and taxes, seed, labor, and manure, has been £3 8s. 
[$16.46]. Let me give in a tabulated form an abstract of my balance sheet from 
1878 to 1883:

It may be, perhaps, useful to give the full balance sheet for a fairly typical year. 
I will take 1881, because in that year one of the leading agriculturists in my neigh- 
borhood, Mr. W. Smith, of Woolston, did me the honor to criticise publicly my 
results, and I can thus give his criticism and my reply.

  And here is Mr. Smith’s criticism (newspaper clipping): 
There are a few items very questionable. Take potatoes, said to have been sold 
at 2 shillings per bushel. Why, I bought fine potatoes last autumn at 1s. 6d.,and 
the market has been clogged ever since. Now, take straw at £2 10s. Why, I 
bought a lot last autumn delivered home at £2. Now, look to manure; bought 
£1 10s. for beans and roots, including potatoes. Half his land that must get 
manured to keep on under such a cropping would need 10 tons of London dung 
yearly, which, at 6s. 6d. per ton at the railway station, would cost quite 8 shillings 
Be ton on the land, or £4 for the half acre. These three items corrected stand 
thus: 
From 55 bushels of potatoes, at 1s. 6d 
From 1 ton of straw 
Extra for manure. 
Now I must put in interest of money on £12     
    
    Mr. Stubbs's balance - 
Mr. Stubbs must show a better balance sheet, or it is of no use for him to come 
out to show us how to farm. We can not all buy cheap dung, neither can we all 
sell dear potatoes or dear straw, and tenants’ capital ought to bear interest [prob- 
ably meaning the interest on the ‘outgoings ”]. 
The following is my reply: 
In the first place, let me say at once that of course I am quite prepared to allow 
that my balance sheet would be valueless as an example of average results if it 
can be proved that [ am farming under exceptionally favorable circumstances of 
purchase or sale. But this is a contention which, it seems to me, Mr. Smith has 
signally failed in proving. He asserts, it is true, that I sold my potatoes too dear 
and bought my dung too cheap. But where is the proof of this? I put down my 
potatoes at 2s. a bushel. Mr. Smith says I ought to have put them down at 1s. 6d. 
‘Why? Because he bought potatoes at that price last autumn. But I was giving 
the results of my farming, not of his. And I contend that 2s. was a fair ‘‘ times 
price ” about here for potatoes of my sort last Michaelmas. I know several labor- 
ers, at any rate, who sold their potato crop from the same field [the 22 acres he had 
let out in one-half-acre parcels] at 2s.6d.a bushel,and more than one got3s. But 
for my part I do not argue from that that they were exceptionally lucky in their 
sale. LIonly suppose that my tenants were a little better tradesmen than their 
landlord; they were more successful, in fact, in acting up to that business maxim of 
selling in as dear a market as you can and buying in as cheap a one, which, I sup- 
pose, from his argument, Mr. Smith does not accept. 
So again as to straw. Mr. Smith says a ton of my straw is not worth £2 10s., 
because he can buy straw delivered home at £2. 
In reply I would say that not only did I get that value for it, but I knew that 
my purchaser was giving the same price elsewhere, and that other of my laboring 
tenants sold their straw at the same price, to be fetched away, to the regular 
dealer, and therefore, I suppose, to be sold again at a profit. Moreover, one of 
my tenants who has only just thrashed his corn has been lucky enough to sell it 
at £3 10s. And then Mr. Smith must know very well that straw off of my allot- 
ments is straw, and not straw, couch grass, and thistles. 
Then again as to manure. Mr. Smith says I want 10 loads of London dung at 
£4 to keep my land in good heart. Ireply, Why in the world should I buy 10 
  
1It may be observed, in connection with Mr. Stubb’s results, that Mr. Thorald Rogers, in his 
England’s Industrial and Commercial Supremacy, observes: “Transportation from Chicago to 
England costing from 36 to 44 shillings for every acre of 32 bushel wheat fairly good wheat-

loads of London dung at £4 when I can get 10 loads of Granborough dung at half 
that price with as good results? 
By the way, on this question of manure I should much like to ask Mr. Smith, 
who, Lam told, is a practical man, two practical questions. 
First. If he considers 10 tons of London dung the fair allowance per acre for 
farming land onco a year, what does he think of the farming operations of his 
neighbors hereabouts whose land, I venture to assert, seldom gets more than 5 
loads to the acre once in even three or four years; and 
Second. What is the special agricultural advantage of the large dung heaps by 
the roadside, which I so continually see left subject to the action of the wind and 
rain for weeks, with all the best of the ammoniac liquid, assisted by neatly cut 
channels especially devised for the purpose, draining away for the fertilization 
of the weed crop of the nearest ditch? 
The criticism of practical men [adds Mr. Stubbs] is always valuable, but the 
following remarks made by two other critics in the year 1883 were not quite so 
easy to answer as those of Mr. Smith. The first remark was made by the son of 
afarmer (I am glad to think no parishioner of mine) to the man who is good enough 
to.act as bailiff (manager) of my 1-acre farm: ‘‘ Why, what a fool you be, John, 
to let your parson get anything off his land.” And the second remark was made 
to myself by an ingenious member of the capitalist class: ‘‘By Jove, Vicar, what 
a good plan this of yours is to raise the rents of the land!” 
Mr. Kebbel, in his Agricultural Laborer (second edition), after saying that the 
English ‘‘yeoman sank into a peasant and the peasant into a pauper under the 
influence of the inclosure acts.of public commons and the growth of large hold- 
ings,” goes on to say that— 
Of the practical utility of the allotment system, apart from its justice in some 
places and its moral benefit in all, doubts were entertained, but they have now 
ceased. On the first introduction of the allotment system early in the present cen- 
tury it met. with the most violent opposition, not only from the farmers, but also 
from the clergy and landlords, though it is only fair to say that some of its earliest 
and most ardent supports were clergymen. ‘The farmers feared that they would 
no longer get the same amount of work out of their men if these had their own 
grounds to cultivate. It was also thought probable that they would be tempted 
to steal seed, straw, and potatoes, and that they would fall behind in rent. None 
of these apprehensions appear to have been verified, at least to justify dwelling on 
the argument. While Botee ate his potatoes, his turnips, and his wheat, to say 
nothing of fruits and flowers, the laborer is merged in the husbandman and begins 
to understand for the first time what is meant by the dignity of industry.! 
Quite in contrast with the English system is the Russian system, where the serf 
has not yet become wholly yeoman, peasant, or pauper, but seems to be lingering 
in a condition that is hostile to industry of all kinds except those hereditary predis- 
positions which prompt him to do the labor necessary to preserve the family clan. 
(f) THE AGRICULTURAL FAMILY oF RusSIA. 
The fundamental difference between the Russian workman and the workman 
in the eastern parts of Europe is that in Russia all are more or less countrymen,— 
tillers of the soil. The workingman who follows a trade is generally a member of 
arural community, and his work at his trade is a work carried on to supplement 
that of the plow, to which he hopes finally to entirely devote himself. Many facts 
support this assertion, says Mr. von Schultze-Gaevernitz, who has studied this 
subject and from whose work the matter of this statement is taken. For instance, 
the sum of the wages paid workingmen is 10 to 20 per cent higher in summer 
than in winter, notwithstanding which there is a decrease in the number of work- 
ers during the summer. In the weaving factories of Moscow and Vladimir, even 
in case of force (méme en cas de presse), only 70 or 80 per cent of the personnel 
employed in winter are retained through the summer.’ Indeed, the majority of 
the factories close their doors during harvest time. Even more than this, the

yield of the harvest directly affects the salary of the factory hands and other 
persons engaged in industry. If the crops have been large, the peasant. possessing 
enough to satisfy his material needs and pay his taxes has no need to supplement 
farming by factory work, and the scarcity of hands raises the wages of that class 
of workmen. If the crops have failed, the plentitude of applications for work 
diminishes the wage paid.!. The factory hand looks upon the rural village as his 
home. When he is forced by his necessities to seek work at the factories, where 
he is brought under a régime somewhat resembling that proposed by collectivistic 
socialists or communists, he leads a life of restraint such as a person enrolled in 
the army leads. He has a barrack, poor food, and is watched lest he escape. 
The Russian hates and despises shop work. This feeling is universally prevalent 
among the rural populations.’ It is the rural association that supports the sick 
and the feeble and brings up the children. The absence of children in the tene- 
ment houses attached to the great factories of Moscow and Vladimir is a matter 
of astonishment to the visitor from other partsof Europe. Thatsentiment so char- 
acteristic of the English race which is expressed by the word “home” is present 
in the Slavic character in the association of ideas that is engendered by the pecu- 
liar clanlike organization called by Mr. von Schultze-Gaevernitz “family asso- 
ciation” (V’association familiale), and its peculiarity is that it is not based upon 
parentage, but is a true economic association of peasants. Mr. Emile de Laye- 
leye speaks for this association. He calls it a family community (la commun- 
auté de famille), and his description of such a community may be of interest,   
The community of the southern Slav is composed of a large number of buildings. 
The peste building is made of wood, is inclosed by a hedge or a palisade, and 
is surrounded by a lawn covered with fruit trees. Here the chief of.the family 
(gaspoden} lives with his children, and perhaps another couple with their children. 
n the building is the common room where the whole family, 10, 20,50, or 60, meet 
to eat or pass the evening. In other subordinate structures are chambers for the 
other members of the family group, and near by the stables, granaries, etc., of the 
farm. All these make quite an imposing appearance. The more there are in the 
family the more it is considered that God has blessed the community. Poverty 
never comes, say these people, to an undivided family. Nevertheless, the com- 
munities never become numerous enough to form a village. There are villages 
whose inhabitants have the same name, but they aresplit up into many hadrugas. 
In the case of the people of Croatia I have found three generations united under 
the same roof—the grandparents who have retired from work, their children who 
work, one being the gaspodar, and their grandchildren. The difficulty of finding 
employment, the preoccupation to protect the well being of the association, the 
life in common, all are obstacles to too early marriages.* 
Part HIl—METALLURGICAL CONCEPTIONS. 
The best distinction that science can make between what is historic and prehis- 
toric in the existence of man is to separate the course of his civilization into a 
stone and a metalliferous age. The fable of antiquity, born of the hopeful spirit 
which ever prompts man to regret the past and to entertain still more satisfactory 
conceptions for the future, made the world begin with a happy age of gold, which 
passed into an age of iron. But the industrial history of the nineteenth century, 
if it has any significance, pronounces emphatically that in more senses than one 
anage of gold is best approximated through the most varied and unlimited use of 
iron in its several metallurgic forms. Modern statisticians lack a calculus that 
will enable them to measure the wealth of England as accurately as the agents of 
her first Norman king recorded it for his Domesday Book, and no husbandman, 
however humble, on visiting the city now removes the glass windows of his dwell-

Henry VIII,'nor are the royal pots and frying pans now classed among the Crown 
jewels of England, as in the reign of Edward HI.? 
But however lavishly nature has excreted iron ore in every geological pemiod: 
for the accomplishment of an iron age, the successful inauguration of such an. 
epoch in human history has been largely dependent upon the deposits of coal laid 
down during the Carboniferous period. The inestimable value of these deposits 
has beguiled many persons into speculation as to the limit of the supply; but while. 
the calculations are issuing from the press, discoveries in other lands modify their 
conclusions.’ 
Though by no means so intrinsically useful as iron or coal is, yet. seemingly 
indispensable to the progress of civilization, the precious metals are from their 
rarity esteemed as aids of business and ostentation. To gold and silver may bo. 
added the many varieties of minerals, stones, and earths that nature has placed 
at the disposal of man, either gratuitously or through his skill as an engineer. 
Skill in engineering, however, is not a gift of nature. It is due entirely to the 
aceumulated efforts made by men of vigorous will, adequate understanding, and 
patience to overcome the natural obstacles they encounter in the prosecution of 
their designs. It is the character of such conquests, after a large number of 
processes have been accumulated, to permit the disentanglement of what is purely 
local in them and leave a rule of procedure of general application. If the indi- 
vidual instances are generalized to the highest possible degree, the rules are apt 
to be more valuable to the student than to the practitioner, and to limit the other- 
wise untrammeled possibilities of scientific generalizations disconnected from prac- 
tice the idea of the old German polytechnic, with its courses of lectures, has given 
place to a scheme of instruction composed of lectures, laboratories, and shops 
cOmbined. When ships of war were propelled by sails it never occurred to the 
naval authorities to confine the instruction of a midshipman to lectures on the 
parallelogram of forces. Such a course would have seemed as odd as to measure 
aman fora suit of clothes by taking his altitude by a quadrant and from that 
datum to work out his other dimensions by rule and compasses. From the pro- 
fessorial chair, says Prof. Justus Liebig, the pupil receives an abundance of 
ingenious contemplations, but, bodyless as they are, nothing can be made of them.* 
The idea of this engineering skill may be illustrated by the operations of the 
‘general staff * of the Prussian army before and during the campaigns of 1866 
and 1870. The staff had nothing to do directly with the charging and firing, the 
enthusing of the men and holding them to their work, its whole object being to 
place the Prussian army in situations which would enable it to accomplish the 
exploitation of the army which opposed its march. To do this, the general staff, 
the chief of which was General von Moltke, had collected, it is said, all manner of 
details, topographical and other, which molded and modified the application of 
military science to the exigencies of the campaign. The Napoleonic strategy, on 
the other hand, is reputed to have been the heavy concentrations unexpectedly 
made before detached pees of a bewildered enemy, just as in some cases heavy

fore, is but a small fraction, certainly not more than one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of the

concentrations of capital are made upon mineral deposits with great expectations 
of profit through impetuous engineering. 
Asan art, engineering is applied to different spheres of human endeavor, but 
in all the branches of human industry to which the name is given the language 
used is'mathematics, cither algebraic or linear representation. The very color- 
lessness Of such a language makes it eminently adapted to record for practical 
intellects. the facts which are supposed to be free from the ideas and passions of 
the human soul, Beyond this common language there is much thatis common to 
all the forms of engineering, but each of those forms is based upon a different 
function. Thus.it is the function of civil engineering, in its higher forms, to 
overcome natural impediments to commerce by carrying roadways high over 
navigable rivers or over or under mountain tops.!_ The function of the mechan- 
ical-engineer is to utilize the forces of nature by means of machinery, it being the 
difference between the genius of a Watt and a Newton. But the function of the 
mining engineer is to relieve nature of the productions of remote geological ages 
by following her into the crust of the earth, 
In speaking, then, of mining engineering as a science, it appears eminently 
proper to regard geology as its basis. It has been said that mining engineering 
embraces three specialties—geology, mining, and metallurgy—the divergence 
between them not being great.?- Mining connects the duties of the mining: engi- 
neer with those of the civil engineer and metallurgy with those of the chemist, but 
neither the civil engineer nor the mere analytical chemist are called upon to have 
the geological knowledge and experience that should be characteristic of the min- 
ing engineer. Geology furnishes him as a practitioner with the scientific. ideas 
respecting his profession, and while he is a student it is the humanities of his 
course. The cause of the atmospheric changes that produced the ice or the coal- 
making ages, the footprints in the Connecticut sandstones, and the imprint of a 
winged and feathered reptile in the lithographic stone of Bavaria, the casting off 
of the moon mass by the earth and of its rings by Saturn, are well calculated to 
excite the wonder, inspire the fancy, and challenge the credulity of any but the 
dullest or the most restricted intellects. 
  
1The charter of incorporation of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London, defines civil 
engineering as “The art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and con- 
venience of man as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and inter- 
nal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, 
and docks, for internal intercouse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbors, 
moles, breakwaters, and light-houses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the 
purposes of commerce, and in the construction and adaptation of machinery, and in the drain- 
age of cities and towns.” In France the title of engineer was given to persons engaged in 
trigonometrical surveying (ingénieurs géographes), etc. 
2By Professor Ihlseng, of the State College of Pennsylvania, and hear Prof. W. B. Potter, of 
St. Louis, who, in his presidential address at the 1888 meeting of the American Institute of 
Mining Engineers, speaks of a “ present need in the engineering profession.” There is surely no 
branchof the comprehensive profession of engineering which calls for so much technical instinct 
and sound judgment as that relating to the broad fields of mining and metallurgy. There are 
not many mining engineers but have felt how few constants have been determined in their spe- 
cial branches and in what general terms these must be applied. From the examination to deter- 
mine the nature and extent of mineral deposit and to utilize the properties of the useful sub- 
stance this supplies there is no step in the many complex operations in which the scarcity of 
exact knowledge and definite laws does not magnify personal equation and especially call for the 
exercise of that sound judgment which comes of keen technical instinct backed by large experi- 
ence well profited by. How lacking in detail, for instance, is our knowledge of the lawsand their 
complex operations relating to the origin and development of mineral veins, and yet how impor- 
tant such detailed knowledge to the practical results we seek to obtain. With the present 
means, too, how difficult to formulate the strains and stability of materials met with under- 
ground or to determine sufficiently to insure complete control of imprisoned water, gas, the 
effects of heat, and such conditions as affect economy of work and even the life and health of 
those who labor in the mines. To Professor Ihlseng the Bureau is greatly indebted for the sug- 
gestion that it would be opportune for it to begin to compile information in regard to mining 
engineering. In.doing so it is natural that the pedagogical rather than the business side should 
be here considered.

   AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. ~ 1029 
This conception of geology as the science of the conditions of being—at least of 
physical being—seems to have been held by English-speaking peoples, for they 
appear to have striven to make a school of mining a school of science in which the 
rationale of the phenomena of the earth and its atmosphere are to be taught as.a 
body of doctrine, as the relics of the literatures of Greece and Rome were doctrin- 
ized to the everlasting benefit of the people coming out of the Middle Ages, by 
Erasmus, Melancthon, Sturm, and the Jesuits during the Reformation and coun- 
ter Reformation of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. But geology as the sci- 
ence of the preliminary conditions of being has not yet reached this unity. The 
subject was first included in compendiums of chemistry! and has now to contend 
with the ‘‘science of evolution,” which, like the other sciences, except astronomy, 
is based upon the present residuum of past terrestrial conditions. It is therefore 
scarcely necessary to add that geology is here considered in its narrow sense as a 
practical study in the course of the mining engineer, for its indications are the 
beacon lights that may warn him from unpropitious coasts in the operation called 
‘‘mining proper,” which has been separated by the Lehigh University into three 
distinct groups and thus described: 
The first group is concerned with the application of economic geology to the 
needs of the engineer, so that he can study and value mining properties, locate 
appropriately the necessary plant, and calculate the cost of production. _Itincludes 
the discussion of faults and the means of finding faulted bodies, and practical 
problems are presented. The subjects of blasting. timbering, and excavating are 
taught in presence of actual operations, The second course covers the subjects of 
underground and surface hauling, loading, stocking ores, pumping, ventilation, 
hygiene, and mining law. The third course treats of the mechanical preparation 
of.ores by the wet, dry, or magnetic methods, and especially of the preparation of 
anthracite coal. 
It will be observed that this conception of ‘‘mining proper” stops short at the 
mechanical preparation of the ores,. For coaland rock salt, if either may be called 
an ore, this is sufficient, but for the metalliferous ores a further treatment is 
necessary. .An outline® of the general. methods employed in this treatment is 
presented, mostly in the language of a distinguished writer upon the subject, to 
complete the definition of ‘‘mining engineering” here attempted. 
While ores present a great variety of combinations, three general classes ma; 
be recognized by the character of the negative element combined with the metal, 
to wit, native metals, oxides, and sulphides. The metallurgy of the native 
metals—gold, silver, copper, which are, however, rarely pure—consists usually in 
a combination of mechanical and chemical processes. When the ore occurs in a 
vein, as copper and sometimes gold and silver, the vein rock must be crushed and 
the metal separated by gravity or mercury or other chemicals. In order of sim- 
plicity the metallurgy of the oxides follows that of the native metals. The oxide 
ores contain the most important metals known, such as iron, copper, lead, tin, and 
zinc. With the exception of iron, all of these are used pure in the arts, and as ores, 
with the exception of zinc, are heated or fused (deoxidized) by direct contact with 
ignited fuel, in what the French and Germans call a high furnace (haut fourneau, 
Hochofen) and the English a blast furnace. The metallurgy of the sulphide ores 
is more complicated, and, with the exception of mercury and zinc, the processes 
employed are in general three, namely: Roasting and reaction, by which the sul- 
phur and oxygen are both removed; roasting for the purpose of desulphurization, 
and then deoxidation, as in the treatment of oxide ores; precipitation, which con- 
sists in melting the sulphide ores with some substance having a stronger affinity 
for sulphur than for the metal to be reduced from the ore. In this last process 
the unroasted sulphide ore is melted with iron or iron-works cinder and the fluxes

in the order in which they are discussed and illustrated in the lectures at the Royal Institution 
of Great Britain. Mr. Brando in his preface to the third edition (1830) remarks, “the subject of 
geology has been entirely omitted, as embracing a variety of details not strictly chemical, and 
as occupying space which I have now consigned to other matter.”

necessary to fuse the gangue or rock of the ore. Theoretically a blast furnace is 
the best for this purpose, but in practice a reverberatory or turtled-backed oven, 
with a broad floor upon which the ore is spread, is used, the hot air being rever- 
berated down upon it as the current of air passes along under the dome-shaped roof. 
lt is rarely the case that a metal can be reduced, that is to say, separated from 
the ore by one operation, but in this chapter the metallurgical work of the min- 
ing engineer is arbitrarily made to stop at the stage of the process where the 
metal is no longer an oxide or sulphide, but notwithstanding the impurities it 
contains is in the state of a block of ‘‘native’ copper or a nugget of native gold 
ready for refinement for commercial use. 
There is quite another point of view from which the study of the formation of 
the crust.of the earth and its elements are of interest to the most practical. This 
is the refomation or transmutation of mineral substances. Mineralogy, it is 
said, ‘‘is.a science which treats of the substances known as minerals—that is, the 
constituents of the earth as they actually occur in nature.”! As the mineral sub- 
stances of the earth are generally supposed to be the cooled products of heat and 
pressure under past geological conditions modern scientific optimism has not failed 
to engage in the pursuit so dear to the alchemists of the fifteenth and later cen- 
turies, who sought to change dross into gold and carbon into diamonds with that 
persistence and infatuation which is so powerfully drawn by Honoré de Balzac in 
his La Recherche de L’Absolu.? M. Stanislaus Munier, sixteen years a professor 
of geology at the French Museum of Natural History, has written a book upon 
this subject which bears the the title ‘‘ Les methodes des synthése en mineralogie.” 
The merits of that work can not be appreciated here. It is sufficient to remark 
that the difference between a diamond and a piece of coal as worked out in 
nature’s geological laboratory is no greater than the difference between the pig 
iron from the blast furnace and the decarburized iron from a Bessemer converter; 
that is to say, between pig iron and steel ingots.’ 
The foregoing conceptions of the work and the possibilities of mining engineering 
are of aself-regarding or commercial cast. The gist of the matter in an education 
conducted on such lines is a contract by the school to furnish business with 
skilled, intellectual operatives, such as no tool or train of mechanism can ever be. 
Nevertheless, it may not be too premature to speak of the social value of such an 
operative, not as a purveyor of goods to the market but as an administrator or 
advisor of those who administer or watch over national resources. A conception 
of this kind, if understood at all, may, in a country that has some appearance of 
being a vast enterprise of European colonization and exploitation, unnecessarily 
seem so absurd that it is pardonable to dwell upon it.

was totally transmuted into the purest transplendent gold at the Hague, in 1666. 
8M. Munier thinks that synthesis, in the hands of the practical geologist, may render great 
services to science, and among others, these especially: 
(1) By permitting the formation of types of simple compounds, such as are never realized in 
nature, but which are valuable for comparing with natural varieties (e.g. Ebelman’s crystalli- 
zation of rubies (spinelles) “‘ who,” says M. Chevreul, “ by a synthesis, has not only reproduced 
the crystals of nature formed of silicate of magnesia and the silicate of the protoxyde of iron, 
but in addition has formed the silicate of magnesia, Si0;3MgO, which was unknown).” 
(2) By completing the series or families of compounds of which the possible members (termes 
possibles) are not realized in nature (e.g. St. Claire Deville [who first prepared aluminum ona 
commercial scale] prepared a great number of true apatites taking unnatural bases, so to speak). 
(3) By producing perfect crystals rarely found in nature or in amorphous masses for experi- 
mental research (e. g- In this way MM. Friedel and Lurasin obtain their material which 
enabled them to establish the crystalline form and chemical composition of hydrated phosphate 
of zine). 
(4) By elucidating the circumstances surrounding the formation of different species of min- 
erals and rocks. But this must be done by comparing the artificial ways of producing a mineral 
(e.g. galena) with that adopted by nature as studied by the geologist on the spot.

and mine the coal, and do so, if not more cheaply, certainly better than individual 
operators, who endeavor only to get the most and best coal at the cheapest rate, 
neglecting the smaller and inferior coals, which are never reclaimed, but help to 
make up the aggregate of tho fearful loss per acre of American anthracites.! In 
regard to copper mining, Mr. C. Kerchoff, in speaking of the large increase in the 
production of copper (1891), observes that it is a matter which is beginning to 
occasion some comment and is exercising a distinct influence upon the attitude of 
producers to witness the inroads the present enormous annual production is mak- 
ing upon the reserves of our copper mines. In regard to gold, it is stated? that 
no attempt is made to ascertain the true gold content per ton of the rock crushed, 
and in consequence the amount that is lost in the tailings or discarded crushed 
rock is unknown. Though the loss is certainly less than one-third, at which it is 
sometimes placed, there is still a considerable loss by universal admission. 
Mr. Clarence King?® apologizes for this waste and attributes the neglect of 
economy and of thoroughness, which distinguish American mining engineering 
from the best foreign examples, to the ‘‘ peculiar conditions affecting American 
mining,” which especially require originality and ingenuity, and also ‘‘ rapidity 
of execution and the consequent saving of time and interest, for, as a rule, it is 
true that capital invested in precious-metal mines in this country has always 
secured quick returns, if any, and investors are impatient of plodding methods.” 
Mr. King, nevertheless, is free to acknowledge that this Napoleonic strategy has 
been pushed too far, and better results might have been attained in many instances 
by more conservative methods. These must originate in the schools.

3In Precious Metals, Vol. XIII of Tenth Census. The writer regrets that in making these 
suggestions he had not before him the corroborating remarks of M. Badoureau (Les Mines, etc., 
p. 44) to the effect that the exploitation of a mine should not be conducted with the view of 
obtaining immediate results, but should be done én bon pére de famille, for it is important to 
eare for the future. M. Badoureau quotes M. Devillaine (Notice sur la Société Anonyme des 
Houilléres de Montrambert et la Bérandiére) to the effect that “‘a mediocre method, if carried 
out, presents more advantages than a theoretically excellent method imperfectly executed.” 
Also, M. Hermet (Exploitation des couches puissants, Bul. So. de l'industrie minérale de St. 
Etienne) to the effect that ‘It is possible to say that every method of exploitation is good if it 
is regularly and rigorously applied, and if it satisfies these three conditions: Careful and com- 
plete utilization of deposits (bon aménagement et épuisement complet du gite), perfect protec- 
tion of the miner, and reduction in the cost of mining the deposit.” 
4Itis suggestive to compare an account of slow Mexican smelting with theabove. ‘‘We were for- 
tunate enough to find Sefior Mateas’s principalfurnace in operation. The bellows were working 
with asthmatic wheezing, a mufiied roar of fire proceeded from the massive pile, and the attend- 
ants darted here and there on special duty. Low down, at the base of the furnace, several jets 
of blue flame leaped hissing from the plastered wall, and from their midst flowed a sluggish but 
continuous stream of the molten metal. With the utmost gravity our host explained his opera- 
tions; with equal gravity we listened. Out of his hearing, however, we laughed, not at him, but 
at his mode of smelting down the great old mother mountain, as if her treasure could ever be 
exhausted in that way. Our return was by the ancient Spanish road, via Tabalopa and the 
Junta.” 
Says Darwin, in his journal of his voyage in the Beagle, p. 284: ‘‘ At Yaquil, Chile, when tho 
gold ore is brought to the mill, it is ground into an impalpable powder. The mud [tailings] 
which passes from the mills is collected into pools, where it subsides, and every now and thenis 
cleared out and thrown intoa common heap. <A great deal of chemical action then commences, 
salts of various kinds effervesce on the surface, and the mass becomes hard. After having been 
left for a year or two and then rewashed it yields gold, and this process may be repeated six or 
seven times, but the gold each time becomes less in quantity and the intervals required ‘to gen- 
erate the metal,’ as the Chileans say, are longer.” 
The ores which are treated at Oker, in the Duchy of Brunswick, are lead ores mixed with 
pyrites, blende, chalcopyrite, barytes, and from 25 to 40 per cent of sulphur. They are divided 
into five classes, two being treated as lead ores and three as copper. They all contain silver and 
gold. The working of these ores comprises seven distinct processes, mainly interesting for the 
separation of the’amount of silver—0.01 to 0.02 per cent, and gold, 0.00005 to 0.0001 per cent.

The function of an educational institution founded upon the scientific or Baco- 
nianiaxiom that man, the minister and interpreter of nature, can only perform his 
function by observing her, is mental liberality or openness to new conceptions. 
If schools: of science forget their parentage, they will sink into the condition of 
those academical establishments which have been described by the Scotch philoso- 
pher Dugald Stewart as existing in some parts of Europe, which were not (in 1820) 
without their use to the historian of the human mind, for, immovably moored to 
the same station by the strength of their cables and the weight of their anchors, 
they enable him to measure the rapidity of the current by which the rest of the 
world is borne along. 
GROWTH OF THE MINING INTEREST IN. THE UNITED STATES AND ITS NATIONAL 
; IMPORTANCE, 
The best gauge of the importance of national interests so far as recognized by 
the nation is the Federal decennial census. The census of 1790 and of 1800 were 
capitation enumerations for political use, as required by the Constitution; but the 
census of 1810 was something more, for it contained a most extensive schedule of 
questions concerning manufactures, an industry then coming into prominence in 
New England, where one-third of the population of the country was concentrated 
on one-sixteenth of the territory.east of the Mississippi River. In the census of 
1820, under the educative influence of the debates in Congress, the crude questions 
of the census of 1810 were generalized; but in the census of 1830 thé political crisis 
seems to have caused the inquiries to be confined to the number, color, and per- 
sonal freedom of the people of the country, which was then more interested in the 
utterances of Mr. Webster and Mr. Calhoun than in manufactures or the tariff. 
In 1840 a crude form of inquiry entitled ‘‘ industry” was inserted in the census 
and included both manufactures and agricultural products. It was not until 
the census of 1850—the prototype of our modern census—that mining statistics 
appear as a part of a new schedule called ‘social statistics,” but not until the 
census of 1860 were they separated. .The growth of the mining interests of the 
United States since 1860 may be illustrated in a general way by a diagram, slightly 
rearranged, constructed by Mr. M. Mulhall, the English statistician.

Both as to quantity mined, value, and capital invested the most important min- 
ing industry among European peoples'is coal, then iron, and then gold and silver. 
But in the United States the amount of capital invested in gold and silver mines 
is.equal to the capital employed in both coal and iron mining, though coal employs 
over three times as many persons as the mines of iron and the precious metals. 
Compared to these four metals, the other mining industries are relatively of mod- 
erate social importance.

pean peoples is at the present day almost equal to that of Great Britain in weight 
of annual output, but far exceeds the mother country in the value of the substances 
exhumed, as will at once be apparent from an examination of the circles.1 These 
circles show the amount of matter raised during the century, the amount raised 
annually by each nation, and its value. It is evident that Great Britain, the 
United States, and Germany are the great mineral-producing countries, but that 
according to value the United States produces almost as much as the rest of the 
world. 
In the Federal Census of 1850 the only industry specifically treated was agricul-

coincided with the tide of immigration from Europe, cach adult male member of 
which is supposed to have brought with him, on the average, $68.08.! In 1860, 
however, coal and iron are considered worthy the dignity of special treatment,

    At the date of 1850 gold mining, and about 1862 silver mining, became a popular 
craze, effectuating the settlement of the mountainous States west of the Mormon 
settlement in Utah. Movements of this kind are not at all subject to statistical 
treatment, and the best figures that can be given are that in 1889 56,391 persons 
were employed in mining the precious metals, at a wage of $2.50 per diem for 
laborers and $3.12 for miners. The results of these operations were 1,587,000 fine 
ounces of gold, valued in commerce at about $32,800,000, and 51,354,851 fine ounces 
of silver, valued in commerce at about $43,000,000, in all 1,818 tons, valued at 
$76,000,000. On the other hand, the base metal iron and the steam-maker coal 
are credited in 1889 with 9,579,779 tons of pig iron and 141,229,518 tons of coal, 
of which perhaps one-third was used for smelting ores containing iron or other 
metals and the rest for heating purposes required in commercial and domestic 
life. The value of petroleum was $81,000,000. 
The greatness of the production has had the effect of lessening the price of the 
metals. The flow of the precious metals from America to Europe in the sixteenth 
century had the same effect on their value, and the equilibrium being again dis- 
turbed in 1850 by the discovery of the gold fields of California and Australia, the 
value of gold is said to have been again reduced. The recent discovery of gold in 
South Africa may have the same effect upon the present value of that metal if the 
deposits are as permanent in their character and are worked as Napoleonically as 
the other metals, It was computed in the census of 1880 that the shrinkage in 
the price of coal had been 39 or 40 per cent, of iron ore 25.5 per cent, of ingot cop- 
per 24 per cent, while the increase in weight of coal had been 30 per cent for 
anthracite, 55 per cent for bituminous, and 62 per cent for iron ore.? The function 
and the market value of the base metals or minerals is so different from that of 
the precious metals that the two classes can not be compared properly in the same 
graphic scheme, but, in concluding these remarks upon the commercial impor- 
tance of the four great mineral products of the mines of the United States, it may 
be of interest to have the increase of the production of the base and the precious 
class presented separately. (See diagrams pages 1035 and 1036.)

  1807, and then only in an incidental way. In an act of that year called ‘‘An act 
to prevent settlements being made on lands ceded to the United States until 
authorized by law,” there is a proviso! to the effect that in all cases where ‘the 
tract of land includes either a lead mine or salt spring no permission to work them 
shall be granted without the approbation of the President of the United States, 
who is hereby authorized to cause such mines or springs to be leased for a term 
not exceeding three years and on such conditions as he thinks proper.” By 
another act of the same year authorizing the disposal of the public lands west of 
the Ohio, it is enacted* that ‘‘the several lead mines in the Indiana Territory, 
together with as many sections contiguous to each as shall. be deemed necessary 
by the President of the United States, shall be reserved for the future disposal of 
the United States, and any grant which hereafter may be made for a tract of land 
containing a lead mine which had been discovered previous to the purchase of 
such tractfrom the United States shall be considered null and void, but the Presi- 
dent is authorized to lease any lead mine which has been or may hereafter be 
discovered in the Indiana Territory for a term not exceeding five years,” 
For forty years this policy was continued under the Secretary.of War, who was 
practically the minister of frontier affairs in those days. During that period

the value of the deposits of copper in the upper peninsula of Michigan became 
known and the same policy of leasing was applied to them. But the périod was 
not in concord with such a policy. In 1846 the first magnetic telegraph linein the 
world, the property of the Government, was ordered to be sold or leased to any- 
one who was willing to work it for what he could get out of it, and by another 
act of that year one-third of the national district was retroceded to Virginia on 
the ground that Congress should have under its exclusive control no more terri- 
tory than was absolutely necessary. During the same year, 1846, an act was 
passed which authorized the President of the United States ‘to sell the reserved 
mineral lands in the States of Illinois and Arkansas and Territories of Wisconsin 
and Iowa, supposed to contain lead ore,”! and among the acts of the following 
year another act was passed providing “for the sale of mineral lands in the State 
of Michigan.” But the system upon which the mineral deposits of the public lands 
of the people of the United States were to be worked was yet to be established. 
By accident in 1848 the superintendent of Sutter's Mill was made aware that 
gold was to be found in the soil of California. Such news travels fast despite all 
efforts to secrete it, and as other States have come into the Union as aggregations 
of agricultural and village communities, California came into being as an aggre- 
gation of mining camps and the business dependent thereon. Men who have 
braved shipwreck and starvation in rounding the ‘‘ Horn,” or massacre or torture 
in crossing the ‘‘Plains,” are not wont to wait long for Congressional action in 
matters where their business interests are concerned, and with an Anglo-Saxon 
instinct proceed to organization immediately, recognizing that individual liberty 
is due to a social compact and sanction.? Among the many thousands of mani- 
festoes of local organizations in California is one issued at the meeting of the 
miners of Dry Creek, Rancherea Creek, Amador Creek, and Sutter Creek, in 
June, 1851, “in accordance with a previous notice.” At this meeting it was 
resolved *— 
First, That rules and regulations for the security of the peace and harmony of 
the miners who are now or who may hereafter be engaged in prospecting and 
working quartz mines are positively necessary. 
Second. That in compliance with that necessity, we do hereby ordain and estab- 
lish the following rules and regulations for the government of the district within 
the following bounds, to wit: All that portion of the countyeof Calaveras that lies 
south of the dividing ridge between the Consumes River and Dry Creek, and 
north of the Mokelumne River. 
Third. That the size of a claim in quartz veins shall be 240 feet in length of the 
vein, without regard to the width, to the discoverer or company, and 120 feet in 
addition thereto for each member of the company that shall now or may hereafter 
be organized. 
Fourth, That no claims hereafter made shall be considered good and valid unless 
the same shall have been staked off in conformity with resolution third and written 
notice of the size of the claim and number of men in the company posted upon a 
tree or stake at each end of the claim, together with the date of day when the 
claim was made, and all claims that are now made shall be staked off in con- 
formity with these resolutions within five days from the date of the adoption of 
these resolutions. 
Fifth. That the size of the claim, the number of men composing the company that 
holds the claim, together with a brief description of the location of the same so that 
it may be identified, shall within ten days after the claim is made be filed in the 
office of the justice of the peace in whose district the same may be located. Andall 
persons holding such claims shall file the same within ten days from this meeting.   
1Presiderit Polk had pointed out in 1845 that the leases had only given in four years $6,355, 
while the Government persons required to ‘‘superintend the lessees” cost $26,111. He recom- 
mended that the lands be sold, but that Government should reserve “‘an equitable percentage 
of the gross amount of mineral product.” It may be added that in the Lake Superior region a 
large’ proportion of the mines are leased by the present owners, and no difficulty results, and 
Michigan is now the largest iron-ore State in the Union. 
2Tn 1847 California had a population of 15,000; in 1850 it had increased to 100,000.

Sixth. In all cases where claims are held by a company working jointly they 
shall not be required to work in more than one place, but: when held by individuals 
each several claim must be worked. 
Seventh. Whenever a claim has been abandoned and such can be clearly proven 
before the justice of the peace where such file was made, said claim shall be for- 
feited to the person or persons establishing such proofs. 
Eighth. That these rules and regulations and proceedings be signed by the pres- 
ident and secretary of this meeting and filed in the justice’s office at Drytown. 
Thus was organized the Drytown mining district,' in the same manner, and the 
necessary changes being made, for the same purpose as that for which the early 
colonists of the Atlantic Coast organized themselves into a ‘‘town” for the pur- 
pose of civil government, or into a parish for the purposes of religious worship, or 
into a ‘‘ school district” for the purpose of educating their children. 
But the founders of the many mining districts established on the plan of the Dry- 
town mining district were freebooters. The land they appropriated was the prop- 
erty of the people of the United States. This was nosecret. The preamble of the 
resolutions creating the Springfield mining district was expressed in these apolo- 
getic terms: “ California is and shall be governed by American principles. * * * 
And as Congress has made no rules and regulations for the government of the 
mining districts of the same, and as the State legislature of California has pro- 
vided by statute and accorded to the miners of the United States the right of making 
all laws, rules, and regulations that do not conflict. with the constitution of Cali- 
fornia, in all actions respecting mining claims we do ordain and establish,” etc. 
Tn 1850-51, General Frémont, then a Senator in the Congress, introduced a bill to 
lay a ground rent upon the miners. A violent debate ensued, in which many pro- 
posed to sell the lands in large blocks; but through the efforts of William H. 
Seward and Thomas H. Benton the matter was allowed to drop. ?* 
In 1865 the Federal Government finally acknowledged what was called a “‘ posses- 
sory ’ title of exploitation, but still retained its ownership or ‘‘ paramount” title, at 
least as far as the State of Nevada was concerned, which was the second Stato 
admitted having a preponderatingly large mining population. It was the law 
of 1866, however, that made the mineral lands of the United States ‘‘free and 
open” to the “citizens of the United States and those who declared their inten- 
tion to become such,” at a cost of $5 an acre and the expense of survey and regis- 
tration of the claim in the land office of the United States. * 
The legislation of the Government of the United States is not the first effort 
of a European civilization to regulate the disposal of mineral wealth beneath 
the surface of land owned by the people or individuals. . It is, therefore, befitting 
that the main provisions of the American land laws, as far as they govern the dis- 
posal of mineral lands, should be preceded by a retrospective glance at the early 
principles that inspired the codes of Europe, not including whatever laws may 
  
iTn later mineral States this form may have sometimes degenerated into a farce, as was pos- 
sible in a frontier community having some persons more experienced in the forms of procedure 
than in the matter of honesty. When gold was discovered in 1848 the news brought an unpar- 
alleled immigration into the mining counties of California. ‘‘Mining for the precious metals 
was a new industry to the people of the United States,’’ says an official report on the Precious 
Metals in the United States. They had no laws applicable to the wants and necessities of miners. 
The title to the lands was in the United States and it neglected for eighteen years to pass any 
law with regard to mining. The miners themselves made rules and regulations for their own 
government. Under these customs and usages $1,200,000,000 worth of gold (1886) have been 
extracted from the mines of California, $900,000,000 of which came from the ancient river chan- 
nels in Nevada County alone, and more remains than has heretofore been taken out.’”"—Gold and 
Silver Mining in California, in Report of Director of Mint for 1886. 
20On this point of the nonaction of the Federal Congress, the work by Mr. C. H. Shinn, entitled 
“Land Laws of Mining Districts,” 1884, has been used. Mr. Shinn makes much of the’resem- 
blance, as was the fashion during the eighties, of the mining district to the “folk moot” of the 
Anglo-Saxons, and even of the system of the squatters of the early Teutonic and Aryan race. 
It is the adherence to the idea not the instinct that is Anglo-Saxon.

have governed the quest of precious minerals on the part of Spanish adventurers 
and the English and French buccaneers who relieved them of the products of their 
exertions as it was being carried across the ocean to Spain. 
It might be assumed that as a bird of the air is the property of ss enacted has 
the cunning or skill to kill or entrap it, so the discoverer of mineral deposit might 
be regarded as at least partially entitled to the subterranean wealth his ability or 
fortune has led him to find, for in the civil law of Rome the discoverer of hidden 
wealth was entitled to share equally with the owner of the soil beneath which 
had been fotnd the treasure—the res nullius, the thesaurus inventus, the treasure 
trove of the Roman and English lawyers. The depositor of the discovered treas- 
ure might well be considered as having practically abandoned it, for he had left 
no statement of his whereabouts nor of his intentions, and with the same propriety 
it might be held that Nature, in depositing mineral wealth by aquatic or thermic 
action, had relinquished all right in her work to the happy individual that 
Providence should send to find it. Two conditions have interfered with these 
suppositions, one of which has been called by the father of political economy ‘‘ the 
sacred thirst for gold,” and the other is the “right of eminent domain,” a product 
of the feudal ages, when there was no land without its lord and the surface of the 
earth was owned not by those who tilled it, but was held in fee as a reward for 
military or theological services past, present, and to cgme, In ancient Greece, 
Macedonia, and Spain the State left mines of copper and iron to individual pro- 
prietors, though grasping those of silver and gold.!. The right to the mines being 
therefore in the medieval monarch or lord paramount—by ‘‘jus commune, quasi 
gentium,” as Grotius names it—the right of the monarch was easily merged into 
the right of the people when the monarch became the first servant of the State, to 
use the expression of Frederick the Great of Prussia. 
The English law of mines is simple: The owner of the surface or agricultural 
soil owns the mines.? The final overthrow of absolute monarchy in England in 
1688 was accomplished by the land-owning gentry, and in the first Parliament of 
William and Mary a law was passed relinquishing all right of the State to owner- 
ship in lead, tin, or copper mines.* Quite in contrast with the English method is 
that adopted by the French. The revolution in 1789 which overthrew the old 
monarchy was, it is now claimed, a victory of the business men, lawyers, doctors, 
and merchants,—the bourgeoisie. In 1791 the first law regarding mining claims 
passed by a legislature appointed by the people dealt with mining claims in some 
degree as the Roman lawyers had dealt with treasure trove.t This law, due to 
the influence of the celebrated Mirabeau, declared that the State could arrange 
for the exploitation of a mine without the consent of the proprietor of the surface, 
though reimbursing him to double the amount of any loss occasioned to him by 
such exploitation. But the law of 1810 first clearly settled the particulars of such 
arrangement. The provisions of this law are as follows: 
The Government has the monopoly of granting permission to mine. It shall 
select from the applicants for such permission such person or persons as may 
appear most likely to do the work without waste or failure. It may pass over 
both the discoverer or the proprietor of the surface, but the discoverer has aclaim 
(the amount to be fixed by the State) against the person to whom the right to 
mine is given. The proprietor of the surface is also considered. He is forbidden 
to mine on his own property unless authorized to do so by the State, just asin a 
city a building permit is required, but if he be not the party to whom the grant 
to mine is given, that party is required to pay him such a sum under such con- 
ditions and in such a manner as the Government shall decide when granting the 
right to mine. Thus the right to mine, though ‘‘real property,” is entirely dis-

tinct from the ownership of the soil, yet as real estate is subject to all the laws 
which govern that species of property, except that it can not be divided.1 The 
State supervises the working of the mine, with the object of preventing waste of 
the matters contained in the vein, to prevent damage to the surface soil, and 
injury (explosions?) to mine. For its trouble the State requires a fee of 2 cents 
for each hectare (2.4 acres) and a proportional part of the net product up toa fixed 
amount, and then 5 per cent for all over. 
In the United States there have been three sources of legislation—the law of the 
mining district squatters as they took possession of the lands for mining purposes, 
the laws of the State, and finally the acts of Congress of 1866 and 1872. Mr. 
Shinn thinks that the laws of the mining district if collected would fill 2,000 pages. 
But what is essential in them is here supposed to have found its way into the 
Federal and State laws, which are epitomes of them. The Federal act of 1866 is 
based by implication upon “‘the local customs or rules of miners in the several 
mining districts,” and is partially a ratification of those customs, partly a gener- 
alization of them for the purpose of preventing contests and fraud, the fee of $5 
an acre mentioned in the act being, perhaps, merely sufficient to cover the costs of 
surveying, recording, etc, It is to be remarked that there are several United 
States inspectors of mines in the Territories not yet formed into States. 
2. THE TARIFF ON IMPORTED MINERALS, 
There are two features of public laws which are more or less intimately con- 
nected with the industry of mining which may be spoken of in this connection on 
account of their dignity, which lifts them far above provisions for regulating the 
business of private companies or persons, or for deciding actions at law. These 
are (1) the tariff laws passed by Congress since the formation of the Republic in 
1789, and (2) the laws which have been passed to protect the life and limbs of the 
miner by the State legislatures. : 
Principal minerals mentioned either as ore or unwrought material in the more 
important tariff laws of the United States since 1789.

8. PROTECTION OF MINERS. 
If there be excluled from consideration the stricken field of battle, it will be 
found that the most deadly occupation that man can engage in is mining, espe- 
cially coal mining, an occupation in which by far the largest number of miners 
are engaged. In 1886 there were 916 miners killed by accident in England, 180 
more male persons than the railroads succeeded in killing of their passengers and 
employees? For every 57,000 tons of mineral raised in Great Britain during the 
period of 1851-1860 one miner was killed outright. Of the maimed no figures can 
be given for England; but in Belgium from 1880 to 1889 the annual average was 
210 killed, and 74 so severely hurt as to be incapacitated for work during six 
months or more. In England there has been a loss of 33,000 lives from 1851 to 1888, 
the victims being killed upon the spot. In 1895, 1,198 lives were lost. Yet it 
appears that this is preventable, for from 1851 to 1860, one miner in every 245 was 
killed; in 1861 to 1870, one in every 300; in 1871 to 1880, one in every 425; in 1888, 
one only in every 484. At the last European congress of miners Mr. Moller intro- 
duced a resolution which he contended would prevent this destruction of life. 
There should be a state inspector, he thought, who should visit the mine every 
three months in the case of ordinary mines, but once a month in the case of dan- 
gerous mines. Thereshould also be an employee appointed by the mine owners to 
supervise dangerous mines under the control of the State, and finally there should 
be workingmen inspectors selected by their comrades and paid by the state, who 
should have a permanent control of the carrying out of the work set in motion by 
the state inspector. It is noticeable that both in Germany and England great 
respect is paid to the scientific knowledge of the inspectors by the miners, but 
that they put very little faith in their practical knowledge of the working of the 
mine. i‘

The great causes of death in mining are two: Fire-damp explosions, mostly con- 
fined to coal mines, that “blow” out methane or marsh gas, and roof-falls and 
caving in of the sides of the galleries, 
The cause of an explosion in a fiery mine has received, as may be readily 
imagined, considerable attention. In the early part of the century Sir H. Davy 
experimented upon the inflammability of the gas that causes the trouble, which, 
he said, when mixed with from four to twelve times its volume of common air 
may be exploded by introducing a light, resulting in suffocating the miners or in 
shooting them out of the mine as though they had been projected into space by an 
enormous cannon. Another English chemist, Mr. Faraday, on the other hand, in 
areport upon the explosion in the Haswell colliery, remarked many years ago 
““That there is every reason to believe that much coal gas had been made on that 
occasion from the coal dust in the very air itself by the flame of the fire damp, 
* * ® and that much of the carbon in this dust remained unburnt only for 
want of oxygen.” In an address on the Chemistry of Colliery Explosions Due to 
Gases Derived From Coal Dust, Mr. Donald M. D. Stuart remarks that the explo- 
sions at the nongaseous ‘‘Camerton,” and ‘‘ Tunesbury ” collieries were originated 
by the heat generated by the blasting powder which, being 3,200° to 3,600° F., would 
so operate upon and dissociate the coal dust suspended in the atmosphere that it 
would be converted into ordinary illuminating gas, or a “‘ gas” composed of 51.24 
per cent free hydrogen, 38.84 per cent gaseous hydrocarbons, and 10 per cent other 
bodies. As soon asthe free hydrogen of this gaseous mixture meets a considerable 
quantity of common air (which contains free oxygen) the hydrogen and oxygen 
unite, producing a flame and an explosion. This explosion liberates more heat 
and sets up another train of chemical changes which culminate in another explo- 
sion when the moving current reaches another place having a sufficient supply of 
oxygen to ignite it.! Again, it appears that finely divided coal left behind in the 
“sides” of the working places is especially liable to ignite from so-called sponta- 
neous combustion due to the rapid oxidation that is set up when the slack of coal 
is brought in contact with air.? The efforts to obtain safer explosives and illumi- 
nating apparatus for mines will be spoken of hereafter.* 
The second great cause of the mortality and bodily dismemberment of the 
mining population is the neglect of the engineer, either from economy or venture- 
someness, to shore up the excavations he is carrying out.‘ As timber is not scarce 
in America, this evil is less likely to happen here than in Europe. But there is a 
danger in the use of wooden props in the warm, moist atmosphere of the mine, 
readily recognized by those who have lived in the moist climate of Florida or 
other subtropic clime. This danger is the dry rot of timber, and is peculiar to ill- 
ventilated places. The quantity of water daily flowing from the Sutro tunnel 
was, in 1879, 12,000 tons, and its temperature at the mouth of the tunnel was   
1Nature, April 22, 1897. Methods of overcoming the dangers resulting from the accumulation. 
of coal dust in mines. M. Schmerber has studied in the Genie Civil the different means recog- 
nized as overcoming the dangers of coal dust in mines, and notably those having the object to 
dampen the dust. The last named method in its several varieties has been more and more 
adopted, and may be classed in five different categories. 
. The use of salt or other body which has a great affinity for water. 
. Use of water vapor. 
. Setting up of damp surfaces. 
. Watering by means of reservoirs which are either fixed or movable. 
. Watering by canals and subterranean conduits. 
It appears that up to the present the method of moistening the coal dust is the most effective 
in overcoming the dangers of having the atmosphere of coal mines saturated with coal dust.—

128° F., and though this is an exaggerated instance of the combination of moisture, 
warmth, and a comparatively stagnant atmosphere, it illustrates by figures the 
conditions to which timber in mines is subjected, especially poorly ventilated 
mines. The first cost of timber and the frequent repairs it requires have caused 
mining engineers in Europe to use masonry or even iron in their shoring. As 
illustrating the difference, several cuts from Mr. Inspector Foster’s work on 
mining are given.! 
When the lode in metalliferous mines or the bed or seam in coal mines is wide 
other measures must be taken. The methods arein general two. The first is to 
excavate, so to speak, streets in the bed after the manner that a city on the rect- 
angular plan on which Philadelphia is laid out, then to attack the blocks of coal 
that support the roof. The other is to leave a wide ridge of coal through the 
length of which a main tunnel is driven, and from the sides of this offshoot-tun- 
nels are opened, piercing the ridge. At the outer end of these offshoot tunnels the 
whole body of coal is removed and carted back to the main passageway. As the 
work advances from the outer end of the offshoot tunnels they are continued by 
protecting them from the matter accumulated by the pealing off of the unsup-

ported roof on both sides of the ridge of coal which protects the main tunnel and 
the offshoots to the edge of the ridge. It is not necessary to dwell upon the virtue 
of being chronically apprehensive in such situations where familiarity indubitably 
breeds recklessness. 
The statutes of many States contain excellent provisions regarding the protec- 
tion of life in mines.” The accident in the Hartley colliery, in England, upon 
which occasion the beam of the pumping engine fell into the shaft and closed it 
1J¢ is understood that the reclamation and anchorage of the moving sands of southwest 
France by planting pine trees (Pinus maritima) upon them by the government, has resulted, 
now that the trees have grown, in the sale of “props” to the English mines, the forest being 
replanted as the trees are removed. 
2 By the act of Congress (chap. 546, Rev. Stat.) of 1890-91, to provide regulations and inspection 
for coal mines, which are by far the most dangerous, the following rules are laid down in a gen- 
eral or abstract sense: 
1. Owners, lessees, or managers of coal mines having an output of 1,000 tons a year shall pro- 
vide at least two shafts, slopes, or other outlets (in addition to any furnace shaft), which shall 
be separated by natural strata of a thickness of not fewer than 150 feet, so that distinct means 
of ingress or egress shall always be available to the persons employed in the mine. 
2. When a depth of 100 feet has been reached in any coal mine, not fewer than 55 cubic feet of 
pure air per second, or 3,300 cubic feet per minute, shall be furnished to every 50 men at work 
in the mine, and in like proportion for a greater number, which air shall, by proper appliances 
or machinery, be forced through such mine to the face of each and every working place, so as 
to dilute and render harmless and expel therefrom the noxious gases, and all workings sha!l be 
kept clear of standing gas. 
3. A metal speaking tube from the bottom to the top of the shaft or slope shall be in all cases

so completely that before it could be removed the whole body of persons in the 
mine had been starved to death, caused Parliament to pass a law requiring two 
shafts, at some distance apart, instead of one, divided into two compartments. 
This provision has emigrated to America. 
IMPROVEMENTS IN MINING MACHINERY. 
The best though not the cheapest instrument in excavating ore in subterranean 
mining is the skillful miner, and all “improvements” in mining machinery are 
directed on the one hand to supplanting him or to enabling him to work more expe- 
ditiously by removing the accumulated water and gases that impede or would 
eventually prevent his working at all, and on the other hand to the economical 
transportation of the product of his labor to the places of assortment and final 
deposit. Explosives and the drill are generally employed in operations for metal- 
liferous ores, but the inflamable and dust-laden nature of the atmosphere of many 
coal mines renders the use of explosives dangerous. 
Few forms of manual labor surpass in their arduousness of muscular exertion, 
in their painful constraint of attitude and movement, in their liability to acci- 
dent and death, and in their habitual and unavoidable filthiness, the toilsome strug- 
gle of the industrious, lonely pickman, whose hard lot has consigned him to pass 
his working hours hewing with violent efforts into a hard seam of coal in a badly 
ventilated mine.! Where the coal seams are thick, and the miner has 5 or 6 feet of 
thickness to smash at,a bungler by sheer brute strength can manage to make a fair 
wage. But such men are dangerous to havein amine. It takes a man years to 
become acquainted with all the indications of danger. ‘‘ The eye, the ear, the 
sense of smell, and the very nerves of the experienced man tell him when danger 
isnear. If it were otherwise the accidents in mines would be tenfold more numer- 
ous than what they are.”* In excavating other minerals than coal, however, the 
dangers and the discomforts are possibly fewer. 
THE MACHINE Rock DRILL. 
The rock drill, it is claimed, is distinctively an American invention. It embodies 
more newness in comparison with its volume and weight than any other machine 
of equal importance. André, in his work on Coal Mining, states the requirements 
of such a machine to be— 
1. A machine rock drill should be simple in construction and strong in every 
part. 
provided. An improved safety catch shall be provided, and a sufficient cover overhead shall be 
provided on every carriage used in lowering or hoisting pérsons. Only experienced and com- 
petent men shall be placed in charge of hoisting apparatus, and the number of persons to be 
admitted at one time in the carriage shall be specified by the inspector of the mine hereafter 
described. 
4, There shall be appointed by the President as mine inspector for each organized or unorgan- 
ized Territory (practically Alaska) a person who is either a practical miner or a mining engi- 
neer, and who shall not be interested in the operation of any mine in the Territory while 
serving as inspector. He shall have right of access to and of inspection of any coal mine in the 
Territory, but in performing this duty he shall in no way impede or obstruct the working of 
the mine, and the owner shall furnish him facilities for performing his duty. He shall report at 
least once a year upon the condition of the mine and the provisions for the health and safety 
of the miners, as detailed above. In case of fatal accident, a full report shall be made by the 
management of the mine to the inspector in writing. 
5. Failure to comply with the provisions of this act is punishable by a fine of $500 or less sum, 
and as a cumulative remedy, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the working of the 
mine until the law is complied with. 
Nore.—Any organized Territory certifying a copy of its laws for the safe operation of mines 
within its Territory shall be relieved from the incidence of the Federal law.

2. It should consist of few parts, and especially of few moving parts. 1045 
8. It should be as light in weight as can be made consistent with the first con- 
dition. 
4, It should oceupy but little space. 
5. The striking part should be rela- 
tively of great weight and should strike 
the rock directly. 
6. No other part than the piston 
should be exposed to violent shocks. 
7. The piston should be capable of 
working with avariablelength of stroke. 
8. The sudden removal of the resist- 
ance should not be liable to cause any 
injury to any part. : 
9. The rotary motion of the drill 
should take place automatically. 
10. The feed, if automatic, should be 
regulated by the advance of the piston 
as the cutting advances. 
J. J. Couch, of Philadelphia, first 
patented, in 1849, a percussive rock drill 
embodying some of these features. In 
the same year, but a little later, Joseph 
W. Fowle, of Boston, patented and built 
a drill, the first one that had ever been 
introduced where the drilling tool was 
attached directly to the engine or was 
an elongation of the piston rod. Sub- 
sequently Charles Burleigh constructed 
a drill on Fowle’s patents, embodying 
important improvements. Since then, 
Ingersoll, Wood, Githens, and Sergeant 
have endeavored to bring the drill more 
nearly to André’s dicta. All the early 
drills were what are now known as 
“tappet” drills; that is, the movement 
of the valve was effected by ‘‘tap pets” 
projecting into the cylinder and struck 
or moyed by the piston. But the “‘tap- 
pet” construction does not follow one of 
the most important conditions of a per- 
fect rock drill in that a part other 
than the piston is ‘‘exposed to violent 
shocks.”! In 1873 Henry C. Sergeant 
abandoned the idea of the old tappet- 
moved drills and designed the Ingersoll 
Eclipse drill, which is described by its 
manufacturers as follows: 
The Ingersoll has a variable piston 
stroke, which is of utmost importance 
in a rock drill. In starting a hole in 
hard rock the stroke is shortened by 
simply turning the crank, thus feeding 
down the bit close to the rock. A hole 
can be started with a short stroke in 
one-half the time required with a full 
stroke. Another advantage of the varia- 
ble stroke is that it enables the drill to

| work loose in seamy or broken holes and to loosen the mud inmuddy holes. This 
drilling machine has only two quick-moving parts—the piston and the valye—and 
no part except the piston is subject to violent shocks. The blow struck is un- 
cushioned, for the valve does not move until the blow is delivered, which is thus 
struck on the rock with full force, the machine not using steam or air expansively 
but at full pressure in the blow and the recovery. Danger of breakage is over- 
come by elastic buffers at both ends of the cylinder. The machine is compara- 
tively light, and is equally effective in both wet and dry holes. The drill may be 
run either by steam or compressed air, and may be operated attached to a tripod 
or a shaft or a quarry bar. 
A very important feature, it is claimed, is the single-spool valve (C of the illus- 
tration), which admits the motive power into the cylinder (A) to move the piston 
(B), which, being light, is itself moved back and forth easily by the steam or air 
used in the drill. 
The economy of rock drilling by machinery was at one time a mooted question. 
Mr. G. C. André! (writing in 1876) speaks somewhat paradoxically upon this 
matter. After mentioning the inclination of the miner not to work so ‘“‘arduously” 
  Positions of a machine drill in sinking, drifting, and stopping. 
and his demands for more pay and combinations to obtain it, Mr. André remarks 
that ‘‘rock drilling is less a saving of money than of time;” forthe ‘‘ merit of the 
machine drill lies in its ability to concentrate the work of a number of men upon 
one point, or, which amounts to the same thing, to increase the amount of work 
executed in a given time by a given number of men, but the cost in most cases 
remains undiminished.” It would thus appear, according to Mr. André, that as 
far as mining minerals is concerned, the machine saves time but not money. In 
sinking shafts or in tunneling where there may be a feverish anxiety to get at or 
through something the value of the rock-drilling machinery in hard rock is indis- 
putable, but even in soft rock it is claimed by the manufacturers of the machine 
drills that ‘‘a mistaken idea is sometimes entertained by operators that in soft 
rock a hole can be drilled by hand before a power drill can be set up for the work. 
The conditions are exceptional when over five to ten minutes are required to set 
the bar (the supporting column upon which drill is mounted) in position, and once 
set, the hole is put down very rapidly. In sandstones a foot of 2-inch hole is 
drilled at the rate of 8 to 20 inches per minute, in limestones from 4 to 14 inches,

and in granites from 2 to 8 inches, all running time. In some extremely hard, 
blocky materials the rate is less; butit is arule that the harder the rock is to drill 
the greater is the advantage of machine over hand work. When drilling by 
hand the steel must be removed and the hole ‘mudded’ out every few inches. 
Power drills have a run of steel of 24 inches, and the hole cleans itself in most 
cases, often running to a depth of 8 to 12 feet without the use of a sand pump or 
swab-stick. Two drills may be mounted on one bar where the rock is hard and 
rapid progress is desired.”

“Perforateur ” of the Dubois-Frangois drill. 
A perforater, as the French call these drills, known in the trade as the Dubois- 
Frangois, is highly spoken of. Itconsists of a bronze cylinder within which moves 
a piston marked P in the cut, the rod of which T carries the drill. <A is a buffer 
in a chamber for compressed air serving to lessen the shock. Above the piston is 
the pathway through which the compressed air, admitted at the valve B, flows 
down through m and n to operate the piston. At C and D are secondary pistons, 
of which D is the larger and is pierced with an airway 00. The compressed air 
in the upper chamber striking both C and D drives them toward 8, and the pas- 
sageway m is opened, but the air flowing through oO fills the chamber S and the 
two secondary cylinders are moved back and the passageway 7 is opened for an

to drive the piston rod T back causes E to operate the tappit so as to open S and 
let out the compressed air in the chamber into which the piston D works. The 
drill is rotated by an apparatus not here figured. As many as three or four of 
these perforators may be mounted and operated, as shown in the cut.!

machine must be set up, the holes bored, and then the whole apparatus must be 
removed from the effects of the contemplated explosion. Perhaps these features 
of mining will never be entirely superseded by methods which occasion less 
delay, but for years unremitting efforts have been made to accomplish the work 
of the pick with as little discontinuity in the work on the coal vein as possible, 
and apparently there are several machines that will perform the work to a 
moderately satisfactory degree. 
_ In 1863 a coal-cutting machine was introduced into the Ardsley and Newbottle 
collieries, England, upon the merits of which Prof. Henry D. Rogers was enthusias- 
tic. This machine consisted of a large iron cylinder mounted on an iron truck (as 
shownin the cut), with a piston working as in a locomotive, except that, instead of 
communicating its in-and-out motion to a set of wheels, it caused an upright pillar

or tubular shaft, to the lower end of which was attached the handle of a massive 
pick, to make a quarter revolution or more! Thus, instead of the miner resting 
upon his side, slowly undercutting the seam, upon which he works until the 
rumble of the setting coal warns him to desist, we have the pneumatic engine 
driving a ponderous pick, into the lower edge of the seam or beneath it at the 
speed of 120 strokes a minute, managed by one man comfortably seated on the 
carriage behind the cylinder, and refreshed by the escape of the air which struck 
the last blow. In this way one man pleasantly performed the dismal toil of 
fifteen or twenty able-bodied men, The success of the pneumatic picking machine 
being assured, Professor Rogers asks how will the miner who it is to supplant 
welcome it? And he finds no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that, in 
view of the deadly character of work in the coal mines, the collier will rejoice

that heaven has sent a machine that will keep fourteen to nineteen men out of the 
mines. On the other hand, it has been estimated by that stanch friend of the 
miner, having been himself one, the Honorable Thomas Burt, M. P., that in coal 
mines alone 46,000. miners have lost their lives since 1861, the epoch of the perfec- 
tion of the pneumatic picking machine of Yorkshire, to say nothing of the maimed 
and poisoned. 
  
  The Winstanley coal cutter. 
The principle of the coal-cutting machine just described was a pick upon a 
handle moved by the partial revolution of an upright column, to which it was 
attached, as a spoke to the hub of a wheel. By 1875 a coal-cutting machine was 
described as in successful operation in which the pick was replaced by a circular 
saw operated, as before, by a pneumatic engine.' In a 4-foot seam it was said that 
the capacity of one machine would be 50 tons for each shift of ten hours, the work

of thirty or forty men.? This engine was called the monitor coal cutter, appar- 
ently from the revolving disk in the edge of which were placed the knives which 
cut their way into the surface of the wall of coal to the depth of 56 inches. 
Among later inventions still are the Ingersoll-Sergeant coal cutter, the Yoch 
coal-cutting machine, and the Harrison. In the Yorkshire pick we have had the 
swinging motion imparted by the miner to his pickimitated by amachine. In the 
monitor engine we have had the tearing or abrading motion given by a rotating 
disk. We now come to the consideration of an instrument that pounds or drills 
out a groove by a blow delivered bya straight forward or thrusting motion against

requires no track. The illustration will sufficiently well describe its make-up and 
mobility. 
The diamond rock drill, despite its merits as a prospecting instrument, can not 
be more than mentioned here, for we are considering methods of skillfully 
exploiting a deposit, not of enriching deposit hunters. 
THE SUBTERRANEAN TRANSPORTATION OF THE ORE. 
The ore being broken or blasted from its natural place, it becomes necessary to 
remove it as economically but as quickly as possible. An old method of starting 
it on its journey to the mule-drawn car is shown in the cut, but the mule power

  which was formerly the great motor of the mine is now being supplanted by the 
locomotive. At first this innovation was a mere form of the surface engine, but 
its disadvantage was that it vitiated the atmosphere of the mine. The con- 
structors of this form of locomotive have now engaged in the construction of 
motors operated either by electricity or compressed air.' 
When the level upon which the deposit is being worked does not open upon the 
side of a declivity, it is very evident that the transported product of the mine 
must be lifted to the surface of the earth, This was formerly accomplished in a 
very primitive way in Spanish America by the human back® and at the copper 
mines of Michigan by a contrivance called a whim.

a “new-type"’ mining locomotive operated by electricity, built by the Baldwin Locomotive 
Works and the Westinghouse Manufacturing Company for the Crozer Coke and Coal Company.

Compare with the methods represented in these illustrations of the lifting appa- 
ratus of the Spanish and Anglo-American mining engineers of 1850 the lift of any 
large building equipped with an elevator or the drums in the power house of any 
system of street railways with its wire rope built to resist abrasion. Indeed, end- 
less chain or cable system is frequently employed in mines. 
But the amount of mineral substance lifted out of deep mines that can not be 
drained by a tunnel or adit is far inferior to the amount of water that must be 
pumpedout. The atmospheric engine that James Watt studied and improved into 
an entirely independent machine was merely a steam pump, the weight of whose 
pump rod mainly pulled up the piston that the atmosphere had pushed down into 
the vacuum artificially created beneath it in the cylinder in which it worked; and 
when Watt, in 1772, had changed the steam pump of Newcommen into the steam 
engine of our own day the first orders that were received by the new firm of Watt 
& Boulton were from the owners of coal mines.! 
In all pumping operations the variation of the steam pressure and of load are 
frequent and unavoidable to such an extent as to be frequently attended with dis-

aster. To regulate the stroke, and especially to prevent as far as possible the jar- 
ring or pounding of the pumping machinery, a fly wheel has been attached to 
lifting and force pumps worked by power generatedon the surface. The fly wheel 
is intended to stop the stroke or to slow it down when nearing completion. Simi- 
lar efforts to regulate the stroke of the forcing class of pumping engines, which 
are placed at the bottom of mines, are apparent in the case of the Worthington 
engines and the isochronal pumping engines. But it is believed that eventually 
the system inaugurated at the Comstock mine some years ago will supersede the 
direct action of the steam-driven piston upon the pump rod or plunger. It seems 
paradoxical to lift water out of a mine by dropping water into it through a pipe, 
yet Mr. Joseph Moore, availing himself of the invention, called an accumulator, 
of Sir William, now Lord, Armstrong, conveys the water (and with it the accu- 
mulated hydraulic pressure) from the surface where the steam engines that feed 
the accumulators are, to hydraulic engines working plungers fixed almost half a 
  
represented in the illustration) with a load of 125 pounds on their back (in 1855). Mr. Darwin 
says that the Chilean tanatero brings up as high as 200 pounds from a depth of 450 feet, living 
entirely on boiled beansand bread. Voyage in the Beagle, p. 283.

mile down in the mine below, and thus forces the mine water in one column over 
800 feet high to the level of the Sutro Tunnel at the rate of 1,600 to 1,700 gallonsa 
minute. This was an important innovation in the drainage of mines; on a much 
smaller scale, perhaps, compressed air may be made to operate plungers in the 
same way, as at certain collieries of Pennsylvania.! 
In noting, even in the fragmentary manner here followed, it can not fail to be 
remarked by the reader that between the steam engine at the surface and the scene 
of excavation within the mine a secondary engine is coming into play. This 
power some years ago first entered the field of industry, except so far as nature 
had abhorred a vacuum in connection with a 
pump, as a carrier of small packages and letters 
from one part of a building or a city to another 
through pneumatic tubes. Now, as compressed 
air, it is drilling holes into the hardest rock, under- 
cutting coal and driving engines, and even under 
certain “artesian” conditions lifting water with- 
out the aid of valves. The use of compressed air 
as a motive power, says a writer in the Scientific 
American,’ on board a war ship (which is a sort of 
floating mine, it may be observed), presents sev- 
eral advantages over steam or hydraulic power 
which render it a powerful competitor. In pipes 
itis less dangerous than steam, especially during 
an action, when a bursted or broken steam pipe 
might prove terribly fatal, nor is it calculated to 
elevate the atmosphere to an uncomfortable degree, 
and there are certain places, such as the turret 
crowded with men, and the steering below the 
protected deck, where the exhaust from the pneu- 
matic engines would be a source of comfort. As 
Diagrammatiosketchof hydraulic compared with the hydraulic power the com- 
accumulator. pressed air (on shipboard) is cleaner, more conven- 
ient, and wholly free from the discomfort that 
arises from leaking water pipes and cylinders. 
As to the possibilities of the great secondary motive power of the times, electric- 
ity, in damp excavations and gaseous mines in competition with the pneumatic, 
or, as it is called, the compressed-air system, it is not within the sphere of this 
paper to speak, but it would appear unquestionable to assert that electricity asa 
means of illuminating mines can never be superseded.* This advantage may off-

3 Several years ago the Society for Mineral Industry (French) appointed a commission com- 
posed of M. Févre, mining engineer, M. Place, director of the Rochebelle mines, M. Bessard, 
director of the mines of Cessons, and M. Lange, engineer of the Rochebelle mines, to examine 
into and report upon the attempts made to construct electric lights adapted to the use of miners- 
The experiments were made with four types of portative lamp, to wit: Pollak, Edison, ‘a trans. 
portable but not portable,” Breguet, and Stella. The report of the committee does not appear 
to have been conclusive, though the Stella lamp seemed to be preferred on account of its light 
weight and the perfection of its “appareil,” which is, according to M. Georges Petit (Revue 
Scientifique, Tome XLVIII, p. 307), necessary, as ‘the danger (in coal mines) resides especially 
inthe wires themselves.” Let these be badly isolated by accident or ignorance and ‘‘a contact” 
may cause a spark and then an explosion. The light is not needed in the gangways, says M. 
Petit, for even the horses know where to bob their heads though in the dark where the light is 
needed, as at the face of the wall, and the lamp from which it originated ‘‘must have the same 
mobility of movement as the miner.” It is useless, then, to dream of a dynamo installed above 
ground feeding incandescent lamps below. It is useless to think the problem so easily solved.

set the hygienic properties of the expirations of a pneumatic motor, but it seems 
likewise justifiable to indulge in the expectation that ‘‘ with increased knowledge 
as to the laws governing its transmission and use, with greatly increased efficiency 
in the methods of obtainining the air under pressure, and with the use of engines 
requiring but one-fifth of the original amount of coal required to drive the com- 
pressors, compressed air will rapidly take a leading part in power transmission. 
For mining and underground work it has advantages which can not fail to insure 
its increasing and continued use as its merits become better understood.” 
VENTILATION. 
Whatever may be the fate of air as a motive power in operating the tools of 
mining, it is absolutely indispensable to the human machine. The State has 
interfered in this matter both at home and abroad,! and in several countries per- 
ons have been appointed to see that the law is executed. This inspection, how- 
  El rastra. 
ever, does not always prevent disaster, and consequently is condemned by those 
for whose benefit it has been instituted. Mr. J. M. Forster, styling himself aminer, 
gives his ideas regarding mining inspection in England at the date of 1885 in very 
plain language.’ Mining inspection, he says, speaking of coal mining, is useless 
unless it is thorough. It is of no use to examine the pit, shaft, furnace, and fan. 
It is the air ways and working places which need inspection, for it is in the far- 
away corners of the mine the ventilating current is weak, and there it is that great 
explosions have their origin. Now, how long would it take each subinspector to 
examine the 286 mines in his district? For the smallest, one day; for the largest, 
two or three days. In short, he can visit each mine once a year if he could devote 
his whole time to subterranean work, but this he can not do, for he is liable to be 
called away to the scene of some fatal accident.

The old methods of dropping water down a tube into a water level to carrya 
current down into a mine, and the method of heating a column of air to carry a 
current up into the outside atmosphere have given place to exhaust fans or other 
machinery not so particularly special to mining as tocall formention. The great- 
est improvement is probably to be effected by a judicious study of the conditions 
of each mine, and not by inventions or even legislation. 
METALLURGY. 
The metals are mostly found in nature in chemical combination with oxygen, 
sulphur, carbon, and silicon, as has been stated several pages back, and, in addi- 
tion, are embedded in matters which are called gangue. The first process, then, is 
to crush the metal, which is done in the case of the native or regaline metals in 
two operations. A Spanish-American method of conducting these isshown in the 
cut in which the person with the hammer breaks up the ore into nut-sized lumps, 
and a mule operating a ‘‘rastra” or drag slowly reduces the lumps to a paste or 
slime by the attrition of the two heavy stones strapped to the windlass, which 
drags them around in the pool; and it was said in 1859 that ‘‘the rastra is used 
with success at veins which have been abandoned as profitless for the modern

quartz mill.”' It is scarcely necessary to say that in the golden age of California 
this thoroughgoing but slow contrivance of Spanish inventive genius, when oper- 
ated in California, was owned and managed by Mexicans.” 
Among the very many machines that the last half century has produced to 
supplant the Mexicans, their hammer, their mule, and their drag, may be men- 
tioned the Blake stonebreaker, which is said to have ‘‘rendered inestimable serv- 
ices to the miner, and to have constituted a most important step in advance in the 
art of ore dressing.”* If the broken rock is to be still further divided until it 
becomes a pulp, the work is done by the old gravity process employed by the pile 
driver, whereby a weight is lifted and let fall, or by the direct action of steam upon 
a hammer, the weight of which is of comparatively small importance, or by an

2Mr.T. A. Rickard observes in an article upon the “ Limitations of the gold stamp mill" (Trans. 
Amer. Inst. Min. Eng., 1893) that ‘the use of amodern form of the arrastra at the Pestarena mill 
is quoted. The extraction, according to the report of the company, was 81 per cent in 1888-89, 
and 78 per cent in 1889-90. The loss of mereury in the respective years was 230 and 234 grams 
per metric ton, equivalent to about 7} pounds per short ton. The capacity of each mill was 
two-thirds of a ton per day. No doubt machines of the arrastra type will, in many cases, give 
the best conditions for promoting amalgamation; but, as compared with the stamp mill, most 
machines of the grinding class have a very small crushing capacity and consume a great deal of 
mercury.”

Anglo-Saxon or quickened rastra process, whereby the pieces of ore are whirled 
around against each other and the bars of a cage, which is made to revolve with 
great rapidity. ' 
The size of the lumps broken off from the face of the wall, speaking of coal, has 
something to do with the amount of hand or machine labor required, both within 
and without the mine, to prepare it for commerce, Thus the hydraulic presses 
which force wedges into holes drilled into the seam of coal with the view of slicing 
it away without the use, in coal mines, of dangerous explosives, is said to bring 
down the coal in too large masses, for they required further breaking up. Possibly 
the same objection might lie against compressed air, which has already been 
applied to charging hollow cartridges of iron until they burst and rend the outer 
coal from the body of the seam. 
The ore broken by the rock breaker may or may not be assorted by the hands of 
men or boys, and in Europe by children and women, but in either event two 
natural elements are called into play—one, gravity; the other, water—before the 
metallurgical processesarecommenced. Take pieces of coal, ‘‘rock” or ‘‘gangue,” 
and metals or stuff rich in metalliferous matter, and suspend them in water by 
moving them up and down, then the metals being heaviest will settle to the bot- 
tom, the gangue on top of the metals and the coal on top of the gangue. This

process is called ‘‘ concentration” in the case of metals and ‘‘ washing” in the case 
of coal slack. Formerly where the process was done by flowing water it was 
called buddling (‘‘sluicing” of the California gold digger), and where done by. 
agitating the pieces in a sieve (the panning of the Californians), is culled jigging. 
Hydraulic mining of gold is jigging on an immense scale, the stream of a hose 
being directed against an auriferous bank, which breaks it down and washes 
away its less bulky contents. It willsuffice to say that noimprovements have been 
made upon the eyes of children and women nor the action of gravity or the use 
of water in the process of jigging save that it is now continuously carried on by 
appropriate machines, presenting many ingenious expedients to overcome obstacles 
in practice to the theory of ‘“ concentration.” 
The earliest representation of a blast furnace is painted upon a wall of a tomb in 
Egypt, which shows us the foot blast and possibly the bloom or mass of pasty iron. 
  
1The Scientific American, September 26, 1896, gives the following popular account of the 
stamping machinery of the Calumet and Hecla Mine: “The stamp mills and copper-washing 
machinery used at the copper mines of Lake Superior have reached a high state of perfection. 
The adyance in this particular which has been made there is wonderful. The early crude, iron- 
shod, wooden stamps that would crush a few tons of rock a day and hand buddles (separation of 
heavy metalliferous pieces from nonmetalliferous picces by gravity in flowing water) have given 
place to large structures of stupendous machinery that crush 4,000 or 5,000 tons a day. Now 33 
cents covers the cost of treating a ton of rock,”

Another contrivance only lately disappearing from Spain and other parts of 
Europe is the Catalan forge, blown by a water blast or by a blacksmith’s bellows. 
This primitive rectangular open-hearthed water blast driven furnace was first 
changed into a sort of chimney by building up its sides and changing its form to 
that of a circle. Of nights the flames from such a furnace could be seen ascend- 
ing 15 or 20 feet above its top. Eventually the heat thus wasted was utilized by 
closing the top and tapping the hot gases in the manner shown in the French fur- 
nace now pictured,! it being understood that such a furnace is charged with alter- 
nate layers of ore and fuel. Attention is called to the massive character of the 
masonry held together by iron bands and the rounded corners of the interior 
cavity.

In the figure below given the hot gases are carried out of the furnace proper and 
emptied into a secondary chamber, through which a fresh-air pipe runs, where 
the gases are burnt by letting in atmospheric air, and the flame thus created heats 
the fresh-air pipes in the chamber, and necessarily the uncontaminated air being 
driven through them by machinery to the tuyére or blast nozzle. Through the 
invention by Sir Williams Siemens of a ‘‘regenerator gas furnace,” this method 
of heating the blast, though an immensely important improvement, has in turn 
been antiquated as completely as the high furnace has antiquated the open- 
hearthed. As applied to the blast furnace, the Siemens furnace is called the Cowper ~

In speaking of the Catalan forge, it has been taken as the predecessor of the 
“Haut fourneau,” or shaft furnaces. This is not altogether true. The Catalan 
forge, open-hearth process, or bloomery, has the function of making weld iron at 
one continuous process, and as such its successors are not the shaft, or, as they 
are usually called in English, ‘‘blast” furnaces, but a class of structures and 
methods called ‘‘ by the direct process.” The direct process of getting weld iron 
is very costly of the raw iron contained in the ore, just as the indirect process by 
the shaft furnace is costly of labor and perhaps of fuel. An illustration of a high 
or shaft bloomery used in Finland was given among the Transactions of the 
American Institute of Mining Engineers.!' The walls of the entire body of this

at different levels or in the hearth itself. The blast, passing spirally around 
between the iron walls, is given a temperature of 300° to 500° F., and, by means of

The old-fashioned reverberatory furnace in use ten years ago, with a capacity. 
of 10 tons per day and a ratio of fuel to ore of 1 to:14, would stand no chance 
whatever in competition with the present style of blast furnace.. But certain 
changes in the construction of the reverberatory within the last: two years: have 
increased the capacity to about 25 to 27 tons per day, with a ratio of fuel to ore of 
1 to 3.. This; perhaps, is the highest’ record reached by reverberatory smelting 
except some work said to have been accomplished in Montana by introducing red- 
hot ore into the furnace direct from the roasting cylinders.! 
A primitive form of the reverberatory furnace, still used in Peru, is given in the 
cut. Itis said that “the most recent development of the reverberatory furnace 
resembles the earlier form in the construction of its bed, but is fired by gas pre- 
pared in an entirely distinct apparatus known as a ‘‘ gas producer.” 
The regenerator furnace of Sir William Siemens has been spoken of when illus- 
trating the utilization of the waste gases of the blast furnace. There the heat 
gained by the operation of the ‘“‘regenerators” in the Whitvvell or: other form of

the!Cowper stove is wholly a gain. But the original invention had in view a 
gas producer as well as a gas regenerator.. In. the gas: producer culm or slack, or 
even sawdust, may be used, though soft bituminous coal is the best fuel. The 
inflammable chemical product of the combustion in the producer is principally 
carbonic oxid, called ‘‘air gas,” and when this is subjected to a steam jet its car- 
bon is hydrated and the product’ is called water gas; this, when burnt in the fur- 
nace proper or hearth in connection with warm, fresh air, bursts into flames and 
gives an intense heat. 
The work of the mining engineer'as a metallurgist is conceived in this article to 
stop with the rendition of the metal, as that of the farmer does with the threshing 
of his wheat. The decarburization of iron in Bessemer converters belong to, or is 
the forerunner of, a species of engineering which partakes more of manufacture of 
what may be called commercial minerals, to distinguish them from the ‘‘ele- 
ments” of the books on chemistry, than to: mining such oxides and. sulphides of 
the minerals as are found in nature. In this connection, however, two minerals 
may be spoken of as having been: first) industrially prepared during the present

century. These are zinc, from its sulphur form of zinc blende, and aluminum, 
from its oxide form of bauxite. 
Zinc sulphide,' being roasted in a reverberatory furnace to expel the sulphur, 
gives off sulphurous acid, which is valuable for bleaching, the refining of sugar, 
and the manufacture of ice, and as sulphuric acid is still more generally useful. 
Through the metallurgical skill of two Germans a furnace has been constructed 
by which some two-thirds:of the sulphurous’ acid is: conducted into condensing 
chambers: and converted into: sulphuric: acid.. A. longitudinal section of this.

Professor Dittmar in Encyclopedia Britannica. 
Nor is this the only improvement in treating zinc blende, as that metal is now 
produced by electric deposition. The roasted ores are washed with wood ashes 
(lixiviated) in walled tanks coated with asphalt.. The solution of zine sulphate 
is then collected in the cistern (B), and when freed from iron, etc., is pumped 
into c, the ‘precipitating tank.” The negative poles (c) consist of thin sheets 
of. zine; the positive poles (d) are of carbon, platinum, or lead. The zinc, being 
precipitated upon the sheets: of zinc, copper, or brass, is. easily removed, and the 
lye water, being rendered acid by the elimination of the zinc, flows.away continu- 
ously through pipes (e), inorder to be used for dissolving fresh masses containing 
zinc oxyde.’ (See cut page 1064.) 
In this way the manufacture of zinc ‘has been revolutionized;” but though its 
manufacture is cheapened and the manner of its reduction changed, the revolution

has left the chemical qualities of the metal unchanged. In the fire process, 
after the ore has been desulphurized, it is, in one operation, put in a low furnace, 
in which are built a number of muffles, whence the metal is distilled over into a 
chamber, from which it flows into the moulds. The ignorance of the metallur- 
gic property which zinc has of becoming malleable at a temperature of about 
266° F. was the cause of its being so long neglected. ‘‘ The introduction of zinc 
among the useful metals,” says a French professor, ‘‘is one of the most beautiful 
conquests of our age.” Perhaps such language is more appropriately applied to 
the new metal, aluminum. 
Davy, Brezilius, and CGirsted haying failed to isolate aluminum, it was at last 
obtained chemically by Wéhler by the medium of potassium, and in 1854 manu- 
factured by Sainte Claire Deville, by the medium of sodium, in commercial quanti- 
ties. ‘‘Since that date,” says Professor Troost, of the Faculty of Science, Paris, 
“industry has been in possession of a new metal, which possesses remarkable 
qualities, fitting it for many important applications in the arts,” and, he may have 
added, for metallurgical synthesis in forming new industrial compounds. It was 
not until within recent years, however, that the natural compounds of the metal

  could be attacked by agencies sufficiently economical in their operation to warrant 
the production of aluminum. In 1879 Sir William Siemens patented his Siemens 
electric furnace, which was the forerunner of that class of metallurgical agencies. 
It consisted of a large crucible (connected with the poles from a dynamo), which 
was placed in a vessel filled with charcoal. Iron, steel, and platinum could be 
melted in such a crucible.! In 1885 the Messrs. Cowles, of Cleveland, obtained a 
patent for an electric furnace, and other inventors soon came forward. Thus 
electric metallurgy received a new direction entirely distinct from its use in the 
metallurgy of silver and copper. Discoveries of this kind invite reflection. In his 
preface as translator of the Baron de Joustrorff’s ‘Practical Treatise on Metal- 
lurgical Chemistry” (Paris, 1891), M. Ernest Vlasto speaks of the change in the 
French practice of that art in the following strain: 
It is now nearly twenty years since I entered the great iron works of the Messrs. 
Wendel at Hayange. The function of the chemist in those days was far from 
what it has since become. Then all that was expected of the laboratory was an 
estimate of the amount of iron, silica, lime, and alumina in a given ore, or the

amount of the ash in coke; hardly more than just that. Practical forge masters 
valued the form of a blast furnace by the look of the slag from it, and wrought 
and cast iron by the appearance of its fracture with a serene indifference to what 
its internal composition might be. Some years previously, indeed, forge masters 
had asked contemptuously, ‘‘ What do I want with a chemist in my establish- 
ment?” and no one permitted himself to indulge in the extravagance of a labora- 
tory except through vanity or for an advertisement. But the echo of the German 
cannon woke up our engineers. We began to study the steel guns of Krupp and 
the manufacture of this new steel. The war once ended, industrial metallurgy 
made a remarkable advance among us. We studied more—we studied what the 
English were doing. In short, we put ourselves to the task of analyzing a metal 
80 that we could reproduce its character in any desired form. 
In the way just described by M. Vlasto the possibilities of the synthetic miner- 
alogy spoken of some pages back are evident.' 
WHAT IS TAUGHT IN MINING SCHOOLS. 
In the foregoing, after speaking of the mining-school curriculum from a, theo- 
retical point of view, we first briefly considered the manner in which the State 
has become connected with the exploitation of the mineral wealth within its bor- 
ders, then the value of that wealth, and finally the improvement in the methods 
of treating it. In brief, it has been implied that a scientific study of mining with 
a view to a conservative treatment of the deposits with which nature has endowed 
the country as the basis of its industrial prosperity is well worth the study of 
our publicly endowed institutions of education. The selection of this social con- 
ception of mining engineering as a basis upon which to operate a school of mines 
may possibly be unfortunate, but the remark may be ventured that some con- 
ception beyond the mere personal aggrandizement of the pupil is absolutely 
necessary to create a successful school or system of schools. 
  
1In the course of conversation in regard to the, progress of metallurgical engineering, Mr. 
J. H. Blodgett informed a colleague of the Bureau of Education of the following circumstance, 
to wit: 
An establishment converting pig or other forms of manufactured iron into manufactured 
articles of malleable iron was accustomed to draw its supply of the raw material from a corpo- 
ration mining and smelting ore in Michigan. The manufacturing establishment in question 
had the habit of testing the fitness of the raw iron for the purpose of their manufactures. On 
an occasion of this kind it became evident that the structural or internal or chemical properties 
of the iron received was different from that furnished by the Michigan mining and smelting 
company upon former occasions. An inquiry was instituted which developed the fact that 
formerly the Michigan company had smelted their ores with ores obtained from the lands of 
another owner. Finding an apparently similar ore in their own land, however, they ceased to 
purchase the accessory from another and used their own instead. This produced an iron that 
was unfitted to the uses to which the manufacturing establishment designed to put it. 
This memorandum was sent to the manufacturing establishment concerned with the remark 
that ‘this statement is thought to haye some bearing upon a statement which may be made in 
print, that the examination of a metal, if rigorously carried out,—if analyzed in view of the sery- 
ices it is to be called upon to perform,—will eventually lead to the production of raw material 
suited to any given purpose.” To which, in due course, the following courteous reply was 
received: 
RocKFORD MALLEABLE IRon Works, ‘ Rockford, Ill., July 6, 1397. 
My DEAR S1R: Your favor of the 3d at hand. Iremember the instance to which you refer in regard to the trouble I had with iron a number of years ago, and your statement of it is sub- stantially correct. At the present time the conclusions of your friend are carried out in our 
line of business; that is to say, all iron we purchase on a guaranteed analysis specified in our 
orders for iron for our purpose, so that now each car of pig iron we receive is accompanied by 
achemical analysis of its different constituents; in fact, nearly the whole pig-iron business in 
this part of the country is done in the same way. When we make a contract or order for pi 
iron, the percentages of the various constituents in the pig iron must come up to those ececie 
ctaions. The manufacturers of the pig iron buy their ores and fuel to get the results required 
by those to whom they sell. In addition to that, nearly every concern of any importance, espe- 
cially in our line of business, have their own chemist, so that the raw as well as their products 
are analyzed and kept very close to the standard required. Each smelting furnace have their chemist, so that all ores, fuel, and flux are analyzed as used from day to day. 
Ithink of nothing further that I could add to what I have above said. 
Very respectfully, 
A. D, Forbes, President.

Yet it is‘especially necessary and fair to say that this is not the argument for the 
study of mining in-schools advanced by those:who have attacked or defended the 
education of a.mining engineer.. ‘‘ Let it be admitted,” says one, ‘‘ that the min- 
ing population is insignificant in number, that only 6,000 mining engineers are 
required in the United States; nevertheless the value of the material they produce 
makes them. the most important element in the entire population:”' Another 
specialist in engineering observes: 
As for mining engineering, what is there about the ordinary work-of the ordi- 
nary mining engineer which requires a different training from that of a mechay- 
ical engineer? Chiefly a certain amount of metallurgical and prospecting or 
sampling work, But'to become a specialist in this kind of work aman. should be 
a chemist and metallurgist at once and nothing else. * * * After amine has 
been discovered * * * the chief work of the mining engineer is to open and 
operate the mine advantageously, and the knowledge and experience of a civil or 
mechanical engineer gives just the right preparation for this kind of work.? 
To these very interesting statements may be added that of Professor Hoffman, 
of the Technical University of Berlin.* “‘ WeGermans are producing more scien- 
tific men than. we'can absorb, but we have the export trade in that commodity 
entirely to ourselves. Two orthree yearsagoI was traveling in the United States, 
and wherever I went I found German chemists, and they were at the head of every 
industry to which scientific knowledge is applicable, chemical works, gas works, 
whatever it was a German was at the head of'it.” 
However superior the Anglo-Saxon may be as an exploiter of nature and an 
inventor of labor saving or quickening tools, nevertheless in metallurgical or bio- 
logical chemistry the genius of the race is not so pronounced as that of other 
nations to which belong a De Saussure, Dumas, Boussingault, Gay-Lussac, Liebig, 
Berthelot, and Pasteur, or more especially a Kirchhoff, Wohler, St. Claire-Deville; 
Bunsen, Plattner, and Siemens. Men who have studied under such professors or 
their rivals are not turned back at Castle Garden, and American mining has 
fostered German mining education. 
For one hundred and thirty-one years the Royal Saxon Mining Academy has 
been in existence;.and we learn that the French school of mines was organized in 
1778.. Since 1851 there has been .a not very successful attempt in England to pro- 
vide such a: State school. It, therefore, will be interesting to examine the 
characteristics of these schools to account for their prolonged vitality. 
A comparative study of the programmes of the State schools of mines of the 
Kingdom of Saxony, the Republie of France, and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain conveys the impression that the German school has avoided the tendency 
to turn out acute mining critics and the other tendency to make the school of 
mines an institution for training ‘science teachers” (i. ¢., school-teachers instead 
of engineers), or’a.college in which:science is. squarely opposed to literature as an 
educational agency. In Saxony the State owns the mines; in France the State in 
some degree is' interested in them; in England the State merely inspects them. by

virtue of its police powers andthe omnipotence of Parliament. It would: be 
natural, therefore, to expect that the German Kingdom should organize its school 
so as to obtain engineers who mine, that the French school should turn out highly 
educated mining scientists or philosophers, and that England, where the miners 
themselves had asked for a school,! should confine its instruction to inspection for 
the protection of the life and the health of the miner. 
The Royal School of Mines has ‘had acheckered career since its establishment in 
1851.. By 1848 the violent opposition to Lyell’s conception of the evolution of the 
crust of the earth had so far subsided that in that year he was knighted, eighteen 
years after the publication of his Principles of Geology. The effect of his two visits 
to the United States, in 1845 and 1849, upon American scientists is easily recognized 
in the letters of William Barton Rogers, so prominently connected with the Geo- 
logical Survey and University of Virginia and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology,’to say nothing of the effect of broadening the horizon of the English geolo- 
gist by his'researches upon the wider and more massive field of North American 
formations—the Passes of the Mississippi and the alluvial plain the river is creat- 
ing, the vegetable accumulations of the Dismal Swamp as illustrating the forma- 
tion of possible coal beds, and Niagara Falls as a marker of time for the recent 
geological past. The effect in England must have been more intense, and a geo- 
logical survey and a mining school were established. Later on the School of Mines 
became “ Division B” of a ‘‘ Metropolitan Science School,” but by 1859 the Metro- 
politan School had disappeared ‘in its Division B, and by 1871 the institution became 
almost entirely a normal school for preparing the science teachers then called for 
by the Parliamentary grants in aid of science. In 1881 the school was reorganized 
into the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines, and lately into an 
institution called the Royal College of Science, to which the ‘‘ Royal School of 
Mines is affiliated.” 
Quite different has been the life of the French School of Mines at Paris. The 
person who is selected to enter that institution has already received two educa- 
tions—that is, has been subjected to two species of instruction.. First, he is 
instructed in his native and in foreign languages, including Latin and Greek, and 
in college mathematics.. Having’ distinguished himself during: this:course, he is 
permitted to enter the Ecole Polytechnique; where he receives his second educa- 
tion. The course of the Ecole Polytechnique has been accused by one of its critics 
as drafting off the best brains of France merely to make learned engineers for the 
bureau service of the State, and has been defended as being a ‘“‘great physico- 
mathematical encyclopedia,” which is specialized as an educational institution, so 
as to develop the scientific sense or instinct and to furnish each pupil with the 
ideas that later on will serve him when engaged in professional work. In short, the 
school produces neither engineers nor officers.. Its réle is at once more elevated and 
more modest, and is to prepare students for the:special schools; such as the civil- 
engineering school called the School of Bridges and Roads, the School of Mines, 
the Artillery School, where technical instruction is given.? In this Beole Poly- 
technique the student receives his second education, breathing an atmosphere 
saturated with mathematical language and generalizations of mechanical forces, 
and he is taught to theorize upon matter as philosophy theorizes upon intellect. 
Having passed successfully through this school, where the discipline is rigid and 
the instruction thorough in the highest sense, the students who are to become 
State mining engineers are selected out and appointed by the Government to the

ties, let us consider more particularly— 
Tar RoyaAL SAxon MIninG ACADEMY AT FREIBERG. 
Saxony is one of the twenty-four States of the federated German Empire. Of 
inhabitants it has little more than one-half the number possessed by Pennsylvania, 
and of area not quite one-eighth as much. Its mines furnish one-sixth the weight 
of coal and ore annually raised in the German Empire, or about 16,000,000 tons, 
which are valued at $15,000,000, being one-tenth of the value of the mineral prod- 
uct of the mines of Pennsylvania and one-eighth of the value of the products of 
the mines of all the Imperial German States. The Kingdom is old. It befriended 
Martin Luther and joined Gustavus Adolphus in defending the Protestant cause. 
Itscompulsory school law was the first ever promulgated, and its industrial organi- 
zation and system of education are unsurpassed. The Mining Academy at Frei- 
berg is now one hundred and thirty-one years old, and seems still to be in vigor- 
ous life. 
At the close of the year 1895 twenty-one persons were graduated from the Frei- 
berg Academy of this little State that has about one hundred and fifty mines 
within its borders, mostly of iron, argentiferous lead, and coal. For the period 
elapsing between 1884 and 1896 the attendance at this academy increased 23 per 
cent, but as it fluctuated in a remarkable manner the character of the increase is 
given in diagrammatic form as shown on page 1069.” 
It will be seen that the school has attractions for foreigners. From 1872 to 1892 
it graduated half as many mining engineers as all the American schools put 
together, and the school discriminates as to the character of its diplomas. Thus

mine surveyors (Markscheider), 5 as metallurgical engineers (Hiitteningenieur), 
and 1 as Hisenhiitten engenieur, or metallurgical engineer foriron. As this mining 
academy is intended to give a complete scientific education to the mining engineer 
and metallurgist, the student on entering must be 18 years of age and have grad- 
uated from an institution called a gymnasium, or a realgymnasium, or a high- 
grade scientific school, the value of the diploma of which is equal in quality, 
though not in quantity, to the degree of a ‘‘ small American college.” 
Tae AMERICAN MINING SCHOOL. 
In speaking of the mining schools of Europe no mention has been made of the 
fact that they are State-supported institutions. The importance of finding means 
to conduct the wars in which it became involved probably induced the first French 
Republic, in 1794, to create an ‘‘ agency of mines,” to study the questions relating 
to the mineral resources of France, possibly the first geological survey, and on the 
1st of Vendemaire, in the Year 1 of those radical reformers, was issued the first 
number of the first Journal des Mines, which opened with these words: ‘‘ Liberty

gives new forms: as well as new virtues: to those who fight for her. The soil of 
France is as rich beneath as upon the surface. It is time thatthe genius of Liberty 
should avail herself of the natural treasures which have. been held. in reserve for 
her: The Committee of Public Safety has become convinced that the interest of 
liberty requires:that the mines should be vivified. An agency has therefore been 
established under the authority of the commissioner’ of firearms and gunpowder, 
which is tooccupy itself especially with the subject.” It was about this time that 
the French: school of mines was firmly founded. 
The geological surveys of the several States may have caused the creation of the 
American mining school, either by suggesting their value for educating engineers 
or providing geological surveyors. It is certain that the first attention mining 
engineering received. from American: schools was inthe shape of courses in geol- 
ogy, mineralogy, and assay of mineral-bearing rocks, which was a course in ‘gen- 
eral science,” as: at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or the development of a 
civil-engineering course, as at several institutions, or even of ‘natural philoso- 
phy,” as at the University of Virginia, where the course was described as:an edu- 
cation for directors of geological surveys, their assistants, prospectors, and assay- 
ists: As the idea of a mining school began to be entertained, we find it in one 
case connected with the object of “‘ promoting the interests of the university and 
the community at large,” and that ‘‘ the committee on the school is authorized to 
associate with themselves from time to time such gentlemen as are interested in 
the development of the mineral wealth of the country,” and finally the positive 
expression, which the-others may have implied, that the object of the mining school 
is ‘‘ the advancement of the interests of science and in connection therewith to 
develop the mineral.resources. of the country.” But the origin of the American 
mining school bears evidence of coming from Great Britain. 
It has been mentioned that ini 1854 a metropolitan science school had been 
founded in England. The’plan of the school was this: 
A.. General division for those who desire a general knowledge of applied science. 
(Due tothe desire of the Government to educate teachers. competent to teach 
science schools outside of London.) 
B. Mining and metallurgical division. (Due to the petition of the mining: dis- 
tricts. 
Cc. Techaneat division for those who desire to engage in other business'than min- 
ingand metallurgy. (Due tothe petitionof theichief manufacturing towns.) 
D. Workingmen’s division to. afford instruction to workingmen. by evening lec- 
tures. (Due to the rise of the ‘‘university-extension”’ idea..) . 
This English school was kept constantly in print, by the unquiet life it led, until 
in 1859 its name was changed to the School of Mines, and in 1862 reorganized with 
a view to specializing it as far as possible as a school of mines, the courses being 
(1) mining, (2) metallurgy, (3) geology. In the United States, about 1860, a pro- 
spectus of a Massachusetts institute of technology, to bea society of arts, a museum 
or conservatory of arts, and.a school of industrial science and art, speaks of the 
Conservatory of Arts:and the Central School of Arts and Manufactures of Paris 
and of the School of Mines. and the Museums of Geology and Botany of London 
as worthy of reproduction in America. In 1862 the first-committee of the Massa- 
chusetts institute was ‘‘on mineral materials, mining, and the manufacture of 
iron, copper, etc.” In 1864 the department of practical geology, mining, and 
metallurgy was deemed so important that a separate pamphlet was printed out- 
lining its course,and in. the catalogue for 1871-72 the department of geology, min- 
ing engineering, metallurgy, and paleontology was unmistakably prominent. In 
fact, it is possible to surmise that the Massachusetts institute was: about’ to be 
specialized, as. far as possible, toward a school of mines, as in the case of the 
English school. It will be remembered that William Barton Rogers, who made 
the geological survey of Virginia, was the first’president of this school as well as

In 1863 a proposition ' was made to Columbia College, in New York City, to estab- 
lish a school of mines and metallurgy. This proposition was adopted. A school 
of mines was opened in order ‘‘to furnish the means of acquiring a thorough sci- 
entific and practical knowledge of those branches of science which relate to min- 
ing and the working up, of the mineral resources of this country and to supply 
those engaged in mining and metallurgical operations:persons competent to take 
charge of new or old works and conduct them on thoroughly scientific principles.” 
As finally settled upon in 1864-65, the course came'toresem ble rather closely that of 
the English school, as it consisted of (1) mining, (2) metallurgy, (3) geology and 
paleontology, (4) analytical and applied chemistry. In three or four years civil 
engineering was addetl to the course of this School of Mines, whose object was 
now stated to be to give “‘students the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge 
of those branches of science which form the basis of the industrial pursuits that 
are to play the most important part in the development of the resources of our 
country.” In other:words, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a general 
institution, seems to have tended to specialize into a mining school, and the Co- 
lumbia College School of Mines, a special institution, seems to have very soon 
begun to drift toward. a.general engineering school.. It is scarcely necessary to 
remark that during theseventies and eighties mechanical engineering and railroad 
surveying were offering great opportunities to students. As mining schools, 
neither the English or American schools have made great reputations. At least 
no foreign students flock to their halls for instruction: 
An examination of the curricula of the present: courses of mining engineering 
in the United States shows the following facts, to wit: 
1. The course in ‘‘mining engineering,” no matter what the name of the school 
may be, is always one of several courses im engineering, civil, mechanical, etc., 
taught.im that school. 
2. The coursein mining engineering is composed of the same studies and they are 
taught in the sameclasses:with the other generic kinds of engineering (mechanical, 
etc.) for the first. and second year of the intending mining-engineering student's 
sojourn in the school. 
8. The course in mining engineering is, during the first year of the course, more 
or less literary, though there are exceptions to this remark.? 
4, The course in mining engineering specializes its curriculum to metallurgy, or 
to mine opening and exploitation, at the will of the student, save at the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology, where the course is plainly a course in metallurgical 
chemistry, and at the School of Mines of Columbia University, where a fifth year 
is added to the course in order to give instruction in what may be called the 
strategy and tactics:of mining operations. 
5. The course in mining engineering is:a four years’ degree course, graduating 
either a ‘‘ bachelor of science” or an ‘‘engineer,” except that in the case of the 
Lehigh University and the Pennsylvania State College short courses have been 
introduced, and at the Michigan School, at Houghton, and at the University of 
California many special students are admitted. 
The main distinction between the Saxon Academy, at Freiberg, and the American 
mining schools, outside of. the personality of the institutions, to speak of them as 
though they were vital, sentient ‘beings, is that the American school has:a consid- 
erable amount of secondary cr literary study mixed in with the technical study 
of mining. Compare the following statements of two American courses in mining 
engineering with the course of the Saxon Academy, set forth in Note Dat the close 
of this chapterand, indeed, with that of the American school givenin full in NoteE.

The formation in great variety of the compounds of carbon with the elements 
of water, that is to say, with oxygen and hydrogen, is the science of organic chem- 
istry. It has been shown by experiments, which so far remain unimpeached, that 
the formation of cellulose, starch, etc.,is done in the leaf and by the action of, let 
us say, chlorophyll. If there is no carbon (in the form of carbonic acid) present 
  
student enters so badly equipped that from a year toa year and a half is expended in teaching 
him the mathematics and other preliminary studies which he must use in the later years of his 
course, so that any application of these studies must be confined to within alittle less than half 
of the entire school training.”— Thoughts and Suggestions on Technical Education, by T. Egles

Institute of Mining Engineers.

no growth will take place, no starch will be formed. Instead of being satisfied, 
then, with the dictum that the soil is disintegrated rocks, an inquiring mind might 
go back still farther and ask questions to which the spectroscope alone can give 
answer or suggest answers. In the ‘‘Chemistry of the Sun,” and especially in 
the ‘‘Meteoritic Hypothesis,” Mr. J. Norman Lockyer has given a place to carbon, 
or rather to the spectroscopic appearances of carbon, which make it as prominent 
in solar physics or chemistry as laid down in the Meteoric Hypothesis as it isin 
the organic chemistry of this planet. ‘‘The radiation and absorption flutings of 
carbon,” says Mr. Lockyer, ‘‘atford the best means of establishing the connection 
between the physical and chemical nature of the various groups of [cosmical] 
bodies.” These groups are arranged by Mr. Lockyer as shown in the cut, the 
more rapid ascent of Column A at Group IIT being due to a quicker generation 
of heat than the heat thus generated is dissipated in the falling Column B. 
In this scheme Group Iland Group VI are marked by the spectroscope as carbon 
stars. In Group II the condensing swarm of meteorites at the epoch, denoted by 
Group II, is not surrounded by an-atmosphere-like envelope, if there is one, that 
is sufficiently thick to absorb the light of some state of heated carbon which

thus is emitted into space. Group VI, on the contrary, denotes a class of stars, 
each surrounded by a thick atmosphere or envelope which interferes with: the 
perfect emission of light from some state of heated carbon, or, as it is said in the 
case of Group VIstars, shows ‘‘enormous carbon absorption.” In short, a Group IT 
star is a swarm of meteorites whose collisions are becoming more and more fre- 
quent as the swarm (under the influence, it may be supposed, of its vis viva, 
which, as such, must bea definite quantity determining at Group VII?) gathers 
itself together into a bunch, but radiating in the meantime less and less carbon 
light from its decreasing interspace out into space, while a Group VI star is a 
solidifying globe with a red-hot crust of integrating rock surrounded by an atmos- 
phere of unknown density and chemical composition. The spectra of many com- 
pounds of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulphur, have 
been observed in the laboratories in this way, and it is found under certain condi- 
tions, which vary with the compound experimented upon, there are some mark- 
ings, called flutings, which are common to all, which are not, however, uniformly 
interpreted by the learned. The main conclusions are that there are two systems 
of flutings which depend upon temperature only, At low temperatures (a coal-gas-

  1074 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
flame into which pure oxygen is driven to make it hotter is a ‘low temperature”) 
all compounds of carbon give a set of simple flutings. At higher temperatures 
there is a series of compound flutings, the brightest edges of which are at differ- 
ent places on the scale. At very high temperatures each compound gives the 
line spectrum (that is, black or bright-colored lines) of its constituents. Thus a 
molecule of marsh gas would give the spectrum of carbon and the spectrum of 
hydrogen, and carbonic acid the line of carbon and the line oxygen, the heat hav- 
ing broken up the molecule. Manipulation in the laboratory shows the difference 
between spectra of carbon at a low temperature and at a high temperature as 
follows: The line at 483 is not reproduced in the high-temperature spectrum, and 
is therefore taken as a sure indication of cool carbon because no fluting in the 
hot-temperature spectrum falls near it, which is not the case with the first two 
flutings at the right as you look at the cut. 
483

The upper spectrum is that of Sirius. It is an absorption spectrum, and the lines, which are 
black, cover the spectrum, such as an ordinary light ray let through the prism of the spectro- 
scope would form, as though a grating had been let in upon the seven prismatic colors, the red 
being on the left. ‘The lower spectrum is a laboratory or artificially produced affair, made by 
transmitting light through a tube containing hydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure; the red 
line at ©, the blue-green line at F, and the blue-violet line at G shine out radiantly against the 
background of deadened prismatic colors, just as the black lines in the absorption spectrum of 
light from Sirius gridironed those colors in the ue illustration. Differences of atmospheric 
pressure or of temperature and of chemical combmation may cause lines to move a little this way or that, though Mr. Huggins attributed the difference in place of the line F to the fact that 
Sirius is moving from us and we from it. It should be said that Mr. Lockyer uses the star a 
Lyre instead of the more popularly known Sirius to represent his Group IV. 
But what becomes of the carbon ‘‘ phenomena” during the tremendous periods 
of time that must elapse during the course from Group II to Group VI? Group 
II shows flutes changing into lines; Group IiI stars show widening hydrogen lines 
as those stars get hotter; Group IV stars show “excessive hydrogen absorption,” 
and their spectra are the simplest and their contents the hottest of all, while the 
Group V stars, such as our sun, show diminishing hydrogen, but greatly increased 
metallic absorption, chiefly iron, calcium, magnesium, and sodium vapors, which 
metallic absorption in Group VIis reduced, ‘‘ while the carbon increases its inten- 
sity.” ‘The reason why we have hydrogen absorption in such great excess in 
Group IV is possibly that most other substances, including carbon, have been dis- 
sociated (temporarily wiped out) by the intense heat resulting from the condensa- 
tion of the meteoric swarm.” The following representation of Dr. Huggins’s pho- 
tograph of the spectrum of Sirius, a popularly known Group IV star, will show 
that, though the whole spectrum is barred from one end to the other with ‘‘absorp- 
ion” or black lines, that four lines are decidedly prominent, to wit: C, D, F, and 
G, the broad band-like bluish green line F being *‘ characteristic ” of hydrogen. 
The condensation spoken of by Professor Lockyer has been reduced to a formula, 
and we quote Professor Newcomb’s remarks in his astronomy to the following 
effect: ‘‘A curious law of cooling gases was discovered by Mr. J. Homer Lane, of 
Washington. If a globular mass is condensed to one-half its primitive diameter, 
the central attraction upon any part of its mass will be increased fourfold, while
-P-A-G-E-1155
AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY. 1075 
the surface upon which the attraction is exercised will be reduced to one-fourth. 
Hence the pressure per unit of surface will be increased 16 times, while the den- 
sity will be increased only 8 times. Hence, if the elastic and gravitating forces 
were in equilibrium in the primitive condition of the gaseous mass, its tempera- 
ture must be doubled in order that they may still be in equilibrium when the 
diameter is reduced one-half. By losing heat the body contracts, but in contract- 
ing more heat is generated than what had to be lost in order to produce the con- 
traction (p.520). The value of this generalization is also vouched for by the high 
authority of Sir William Thompson, now Lord Kelvin.! 
No one excelled the astronomer R. H. Proctor in his admiration for Saturn. 
He wrote a book about that planet and ‘‘his system,” and quarrels with Laplace 
for his misconception of both in founding the nebular hypothesis upon them. In 
one of his essays he remarks: ‘‘Saturn’s.ring system is in reality a part as yet 
unfinished of his system of dependent bodies, It consists of multitudes of tiny 
bodies traveling in the same general plane. Hereafter, under the mighty forces 
of the planet’s energy of attraction, this system of rings will be broken up to 
form two or three other worlds, akin to the eight satellites which already travel 
round the planet.” Some interesting phenomena concerning rings on a small 
scale upon the face of the earth have been published by Prof. A. EB. Dolbear, of 
Tufts College. They seem to show how a part of the atmosphere can be made 
independent, so as to be a form in the atmosphere. _

In a boxhaving a round hole in one end and a piece of cloth over the other place 
two saucers, one containing strong ammonia water, the other strong hydrochloric 
acid. The dense fumes may be expelled in rings through the hole by striking the 
cloth. The ring, once formed, consists of a definite amount of gaseous material or 
atmosphere in a state of rotation, made visible by the fumes. The ring moves 
forward in a straight line just as though it were a solid body, and if left to its 
own forces always holds itself up straight, as in the cut. It will push against 
anything that is before it; will, if moving parallel to a wall or table, move toward 
it and break up against it; but a light body like a feather or a thread will be 
apparently pushed out of the way in front of it, or in toward itif behind it. If 
two rings bump together at their edges,each one will vibrate with well-marked 
nodes and loops, showing that as rings they are elastic bodies, and that their 
period of vibration depends upon the rate of the rotation. If two rings be moving 
in the same line, one behind the other, but the hindermost moving the swifter, 
then the foremost one spreads itself, while the hindermost contracts itself and then 
passes through the first, both resuming their original form when without ono 
another, If two meet in going in opposite directions, the smaller goes through tho 
larger and may be held for a short time until the other has got some inches away. 
If two similar rings are formed at the same time, side by side, at a distance apart 
of an inch or two, they always collide, either destroying both or each may break 
at the point of impact and the opposite ends may weld together, forming a singlo 
ring, which will move as if it bad been originally formed as one. _ In like manner 
three rings may become one, though sometimes the rings rebound at right angles 
to the plane in which they were moving; if moving crosswise, will bound up or 
down. Tho material of the ring rotates about the ring, but the ring does not 
rotate. (Matter, Ether, and Motion, by A. EB. Dolbear, Ph. D., revised, enlarged, 
Boston, 1894.) Itappears that Professor Tait first called attention to these singular 
phenomena. i

NOTE B. 
THE WHITE ANT—A THEORY. 
A few years ago, says Professor Drummond in his Tropical Africa, under the 
distinguished patronage of Mr. Darwin, the animal in vogue with scientific society 
was the worm. At present the fashionable animal is the ant. 1am sorry, there- 
fore, that the animal whose praises I am about to sing is, as an ant, an impostor, as 
it is not anant, but.a termite; and so far from being in vogue, this clever but art- 
ful creature is hated and despised by all civilized peoples. Nevertheless, if I mis- 
take not, there is neither among the true ants nor among the worms an insect 
which plays a more wonderful or important part in nature. 
When we watch the farmer at work and think how he has to plow, harrow, 
manure, and humor the soil before even one good crop can be coaxed out of it, we 
are apt to wonder how nature manages to secure her crops and yet dispense with 
all these accessories. The world is one vast garden, bringing forth crops of the 
most varied and luxuriant kind, century after century. Yet the face of nature is 
nowhere furrowed by the plow, no har- 
tow disintegrates the clods, no lime und 
phosphates are strewn upon its fields, no 
visible tillage of the soil improves the 
work on the great world’s farm. Now, 
in reality there can not be crops or succes- 
sion of crops without the most thorough 
agriculture; and when we look more 
closely into nature we discover a system 
of husbandry of the most surprising kind. 
Nature does nothing obtrusively, and it 
is only now that we are beginning to see 
the magnitude of those secret agricul- 
tural operations by which she does already 
all that man would wish to imitate, and 
to which his most scientific methods are 
but clumsy approximations. 
Now, in Central Africa, though I looked 
for them often, Inever saw asingle worm. 
Even when the rainy season set in the 
closest search failed to reveal any trace 
; either of them or of their casts. Where, 
A white ant hill of the Lake Region of Cen- then, are we to look for the animal hay- tral Africa. ing the agricultural function—the tropi- 
S cal analogue of the worm? The animal 
we are in search of is the termite or white ant. In traveling through the great 
forests of the Rocky Mountains the broken branches and fallen trunks strewing 
the ground breast high with all sorts of decaying litter frequently make locomo- 
tion impossible. But in an African forest not a fallen branch is seen. The ter- 
mites have cleaned them up. The insect excavates an elaborate system of subter- 
ranean tunnels, which mine the earth sometimes to a depth of many feet or even 
yards. The material excavated from these underground galleries is formed into 
the huge ant hills which form so distinctive a feature of the African landscape, 
extending for miles and arranged in mounds each 30 or 40 feet in diameter and 
10 or 15 feet in height. The brick houses of the Scotch mission station on Lake 
Nyassa have all been built out of a single ant’s nest. A supply of bricks as large 
again could probably be yet taken from it. The work of the ant is also a work of 
denudation. Nowhere as on the forest-clad hills of the great plateau between 
Lake Nyassa and Tanganika are the termites so masters of the situation. If it 
is the case that in these most elevated regions of Central Africa the termite colo- 
nies attain their maximum development, then the fact is of much interest in con- 
nection with the geological and agricultural function they seem to serve, for here 
precisely it is that the tiny head waters of the Nile and the Congo set their course, 
Herodotus, with equal poetic and scientific truth, describes Egypt as a gift of the 
Nile. Had he lived to-day he might have referred some of it to the humble ter- 
mites in the forest slopes about Victoria Nyanza.

SOLIDIFICATION OF AIR. 
To those who are familiar with Berkeley’s conception and proof of the imma- 
teriality of the world wherein he talks away the substance of matter by the most 
rigid logic, so that the only answer to it is to appeal to matter, it will be interest- 
ing to describe a machine by which the common air we breathe is converted either 
into a liquid or a jelly-like substance. 
In Nature for February 6, 1896, there is an account of the machine used by Pro- 
fessor Dewar to liquefy oxygen, one of the two gases of the atmosphere, and 
the atmosphere itself. It appears that M. Olszewski, a French experimenter, had 
stated that air can not be solidified. To test this dictum Professor Dewar repeated 
his former experiments on a larger scale. His statement before the English Chem- 
ical Society runs thus: If a liter (12 pints) of liquid air be exhausted in a silvered 
vacuum vessel half a liter of solid air is obtained, 
which may be kept solidfor half anhour. Thesolid co

              THE ROYAL MINING ACADEMY OF SAXONY AT 
FREIBERG,   The instruction at this academy is minutely 
divided into 64 topics, which are collected under 
40 heads in the programme, taught by 17 professors 
orassistants. There are four courses in the school— 
one of four years for mining engineers, one for min- 
ing surveyors of three years, one of four years for 
general metallurgical engineers, and one of four Fra. 1.—A, air or oxygen inlet.

France. It is preceded by a college education, but @, carbon dioxide coil. 
it is also preceded by a four months’ course of a 
practical miner’s course (practisch-bergminnischer Vorbereitungscurs) for those 
who desire to become students in the school in order that they may have the actual 
visual and practical knowledge for profitably following its coursés. The studies 
of the first year are the calculus, descriptive geometry, theory of higher equations, 
spherical trigonometry, mechanics, study of metallic and nonmetallic substances, 
mineralogy, and practicum in crystallography, topographical drawing for mining 
engineers. The lectures on these subjects consume twenty-five hours a week 
during the entire school year, except the studies of higher equations and spherical 
trigonometry, which require four hours a week during the summer session. In 
addition, two hours are passed at descriptive geometry and two in the physical 
laboratory. 
The second year the course begins to pass from the general to the particular. 
The calculus is now applied to the ‘‘quadrification, rectification, complanation, 
and curvature” of geometrical figures and physical problems. General physics   
 
-P-A-G-E-1158

gives place to the study of the movement of a mathematical point, energy, dynam- 
ics and their applications, hydrostatics and hydronamics, geology and rock forma- 
tion, mining literature and history, the more important minerals, surface and 
subterranean search for veins or beds, rock formation, exercises in classifying 
rocks, mineralogical and physical practicums, blowpipe analysis, and machine 
drawing. These studies occupy twenty-two hours of teaching a week and eight 
hours a week in laboratories or drafting room, except that classification of rocks 
occupies two hours a week only during the summer semester. 
The third year, in addition to surveying and geodetic practicum, the following 
studies are introduced: The use and character of extractive machinery, ventila- 
tion, etc., under the name of special mining engineering, machinery taking the 
place of mechanics; veins and deposits taking the place of rock formation, the 
preparation of the ore for smelting, and finally general smelting. To these are 
added building construction and for coal ‘‘ brikettiren,” whichis the process of com- 
pacting the dust of coal into bricks or ‘‘ water-pressed stone.” During this year 
machine drawing, principally of water and steam motors, is continued, four hours 
a week being devoted toit. Sixteen hours a week are given to, lectures upon the 
aforenamed topics throughout the year, except that to labor-saving machinery are 
given five hours a week during the winter semester, and to the preparation of ore 
and coal, including coal-brick making, six hours are given during the summer 
semester. 
The fourth year is almost entirely devoted to the consideration of practical 
sociological questions connected with the subject of mining, to wit: General law, 
mining law, mining and ‘‘ metallurgical” statistics, capital, competition, labor, 
etc., hygienic conditions, but also mining geodesy and practicum, sketching mining 
buildings, exercises in preparing the ore or coal for commerce orsmelting, and finally 
electrotechnic. Only four of the studies run through the whole year, to wit: Sur- 
veying, geodesy. hygiene, and electrotechnic, requiring seven hours of lectures 
a week, but to this must be added six hours a week of practice in mining survey- 
ing, four of sketching mining and metallurgical works, and two of electrotechnic. 
During the winter semester four hours of lectures are given to general law, one 
hour to statistics, and three to political economy. During the summer semester 
four hours are given to mining law and two to political economy.

  CHAPTER XXI. 
THE TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
EXPOSITION, HELD IN NASHVILLE, TENN., MAY 1 TO 
OCTOBER 31, 1897. 
Report of J. C. Boykin, Agent of the Bureau of Education and Chief Special Agent 
of the Interior Department. 
WASHINGTON, D. C., February 1, 1898. 
Sir: The Exposition at Nashville washeld to celebrate the one hundredth anni- 
versary of the admission of Tennessee into the Union. Tennessee became the six- 
teenth State on June 1, 1796, and the actual completion of her centennial was marked 
by elaborate commemorative exercises and by the dedication of the Exposition 
grounds. The opening of the Exposition itself was deferred until the following 
May, because it was impossible to complete the preparations on the scale desired 
in the time that intervened since the beginning of active work. 
It was during the fall of 1893, when the Columbian Exposition was exciting so 
much admiration and emulation, that the idea of holding its like in Tennessee was 
first effectively advanced. The newspapers of the State at once took up the sug- 
gestion and during the following year the matter was widely discussed. Though 
several meetings more or less informal in character had been held, the real begin- 
ning of the enterprise was in June, 1894, when a convention of business men met 
in the capitol at Nashville. A temporary organization was then effected, a legal 
corporation formed, and the canvass for funds begun. Seventy-five thousand 
dollars were soon raised by private subscription, and Davidson County, in which 
Nashville is situated, promised $50,000 more. The effort to secure an appropria- 
tion from the legislature however failed, and without the prestige of State sup- 
port the plan seemed doomed. 
But the matter had gone too far to die without a struggle, and a mass meeting 
was called and held in July, 1895, to discuss the situation. Unexpected interest 
was developed, and the ardor of the speakers and the enthusiasm of those present 
were such as to put at rest all doubts as to the advisability of continuing the 
efforts for the Exposition. Other meetings were held, and the corporation was 
reorganized with Maj. John W. Thomasas president, Mr. E. C. Lewis as director- 
general, and a board of directors consisting of 100 of the leading men of the State. 
Thenceforward the work went on with redoubled energy and effectiveness, and no 
other serious setback occurred. 
The legislature finally granted the funds desired; several counties in the State 
made appropriations; the city of Nashville donated $100,000, and the Congress of 
the United States passed an act admitting foreign goods for the Exposition free of 
duty, and provided for a Government exhibit to be housed in a building of its 
own, and appropriated therefor the sum of $130,000. There was therefore no lack 
of prestige so far as governmental recognition could give it. 
It is worthy of note that from the conception to the end the purely commercial 
features of the Exposition itself were reduced to a minimum. It was explicitly 
stated in the prospectus that ‘“‘the plan of celebrating this great event is not 
1081
-P-A-G-E-1162
  £082 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
intended as a money-making scheme, but aims at the higher and nobler end of 
marking with proper dignity and display the end of an eventful century and of 
recalling and keeping alive the deeds and names recorded to its credit.” Nor were 
these empty words. They were justified by the behavior and spirit that marked 
the conduct of the responsible officers in all their actions. 
The location for the Exposition was well chosen. A racing park 2 miles west of 
the center of.the city, containing about 200 acres, was selected, and proved well 
adapted tothe purpose in view. The ground was slightly rolling, and though 
there were no grades sufficiently sharp to unduly tire pedestrians, the irregulari- 
ties gave good vantage points for the erection of buildings intended to be especially 
conspicuous. = 
The corner stone of the first building was laid with appropriate ceremonies in 
October, 1895, but the real work of construction was not begun until after the 
celebration of the actual centennial in June, 1896. 
The two largest buildings were devoted respectively to Commerce and Agricul-~ 
ture, the names being taken from the seal of the State of Tennessee. The other 
large buildings were the Transportation, the Machinery, the Negro, the Minerals 
and Forestry, and the Government building, the Auditorium, and finally, the gem 
of all, the Parthenon. In addition to these there were a great number of smaller 
structures, the principal of which were the Woman’s, Children’s, History, Edu- 
cation and Hygiene, and Railroad Terminal buildings. The names of most of 
these indicate the character of the exhibits in them. The Commerce building 
contained the miscellaneous exhibits that have usually been classed under tke 
head of ‘‘manufactures and liberal arts;” the History building contained relics of 
historical value; the Parthenon was devoted to fine arts, and the Railroad Termi- 
nal building was used by severai railroad corporations to display the resources of 
the territory through which they respectively pass. 
All the buildings were covered with the composition known as “staff,” and the 
glare of the sun reflected from the masses of pure white in every direction proved 
very trying to the eyes on bright summer days. 
The buildings were of considerable architectural beauty, and the appearance of 
the place as a whole was very pleasing. Foliage plants and fiowers were used in 
great profusion on the grounds, and cool arbors and miniature lakes added to the 
beauty of the scene. Especial attention was paid to illumination at night, and 
in addition to numbers of, arc lights distributed over the grounds, incandescent 
lights were arranged ‘“‘in rows, clusters, and circles” on the roofs of the buildings 
and on the bridges. About 10,000 lights were thus employed, and strikingly 
effective decoration was the result. 
The plan of arrangement of the buildings was particularly happy. Upon the 
most conspicuous point in the grounds was erected a full-sized model of that 
most famous of architectural master pieces the Parthenon, and around that as a 
center the other principal buildings were grouped. 
If there had been nothing else to make it so, the Nashville Exposition would 
have been noteworthy for the presence of the reproduction of the Parthenon, In 
its principal dimensionsand general appearance it was in accord with the original, 
and it not only gave an unsurpassed object lesson in Grecian architecture of the 
highest type, but it led to discussions of the details and history of the original 
that proved to be of great educative value. Nearly all the advertising circulars 
sent out contained more or less information about the Parthenon, and the Fine- 
Arts Catalogue began with a sketch of it, covering several pages, by the architect 
of the reproduction, Mr. William C. Smith, of Nashville. Nevertheless it seemed 
to me that the full significance of the undertaking was not generally realized, 
and that not sufficient stress was laid upon it,,even by the management of the 
Exposition, 
‘When it is remembered that the Parthenon was the finest specimen of archi-

tecture that the hand of man has ever erected; that its decorations were the 
choicest productions of the sculptor “in whose works were established for all 
time the laws of beauty and sublimity in art;” that for a hundred years it has 
been the favorite study of archeologists, architects, and artists, and that while it 
has furnished ideas and inspiration for buildings innumerable, no attempt had 
ever been made before to reproduce it entire, then the value of the suggestion of 
Director-General Lewis and the importance of its execution may be the better 
realized. 
THE PARTHENON, 
The ancient city of Athens was built around a rocky hill about 300 feet high, 
which, after the custom of the Greeks, was called the Acropolis. The strength 
of this height from a military standpoint undoubtedly influenced the location of 
the city, and the Acropolis was in reality a citadel. But it became the site for 
some of the principal temples of the city, and early in its history it was devoted 
so fully to such uses that its military usefulness became entirely obscured by its 
religious aspect. 
During the Persian invasion the Greeks were compelled to abandon the city 
and to take refuge in their ships. After the final defeat of the Persians at 
Platea, 479 B. C., the Athenians returned to find their fortifications and temples 
in ashes and the city a scene of desolation. Their joy at their return and their 
gratitude to the gods for deliverance from the barbarian invasion were expressed 
in an eager desire to rebuild the city more glorious than ever and to consecrate 
new and more magnificent temples to the gods. The rulers encouraged the ardent 
patriotism and religious fervor of the people, and at the same time strove to 
increase the influence of Athens in affairs common to all the Greeks. The pres- 
tige of the city was already great because of the bravery of the Athenians in the 
Persian wars, and this prestige was increased by the sagacity of the Athenian 
leaders Themistccles, Cimon, and Pericles. The last-named attained a positicn 
of ruling influence in the affairs of Athens about 460 B. C., and the next thirty 
years, the ‘‘era of Pericles,” marked the period of the highest development of 
Greek art and architecture, 
The funds contributed by the Greeks for the common defense were in the con- 
trol of the Athenians and were removed through the influence of Pericles from 
Delos to Athens. He had little difficulty in convincing his fellow-citizens that 
the Athenians were not answerable to their allies for the disposition of these 
funds so long as protection from foreign invaders was assured. An enormous 
revenue was thus at the disposal of the Athenian Government, and after provid- 
ing and storing in the city a sufficient supply of all things necessary for war, 
the remainder was largely used in beautifying the city with public and sacred 
buildings. 
As the victor in the contest with Poseidon, Athene had a peculiar interest and 
claim on the Athenians. The country was hers by the verdict of the gods on 
Olympus. Then the revenue, without which there could be no government, no 
country, was especially hers, and the national treasury was in a peculiar sense 
the possession of the goddess—her temple. As such it was worthy of the most 
lavish expenditure and the highest effort. The temper of the people was shown 
when Phidias was discussing the material for the statue of Athene to be placed in 
the Parthenon. He had suggested the use of marble as the most durable, and the 
Athenians listened.in silence; but when he added that it was cheap they bade him 
hold his peace. The most expensive material possible was demanded, and the 
statue was made of ivory and gold. 
To the Greeks there could be no good without beauty, and what was beautiful 
needed no other attribute to recommend it. Their devotion to beauty was the one 
characteristic to which all others were subordinated, and to tender to their ewn 
 
-P-A-G-E-1164
  1084 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
particular goddess a temple that was less than the embodiment of beauty would 
have been to them the grossest sacrilege, 
Phidias, the friend and favorite of Pericles, was made ‘‘surveyor-general” and 
had supervision of all the public improvements inaugurated by Pericles. Ictinus 
and Callicrates were the architects of the Parthenon, but the decorations were 
more or less designed by Phidias himself, and perhaps executed by his own hand, 
though the extent of the scheme made the employment of other artists necessary 
for the less essential parts. 
An older temple which stood on the Acropolis had been burned by the Persians 
during their occupancy of the city, and the foundations remaining were extended 
and utilized for the Parthenon. Carefully selected white marble from Mount 
Pentelicus was used throughout, in the construction of the buildings proper as 
well as for the sculptured figures. 
The base of the structure was a marble platform, or stylobate, reached by three 
steps on all sides. . The stylobate was 100 by 225 Attic feet, an Attic foot being 
about a hundredth longer than ours. Around its edge rose the architectural sup- 
ports of the roof, 46 Doric columns about 35 feet high, 17 appearing on each side 
and 8 on each end. Inside this outer peristyle there were at each end 6 smaller 
columns surmounted by a frieze which extended all round the cella or the body of 
the temple. In the external entablature on all four sides were metopes, orna- 
mented with sculptures in high relief, between Doric triglyphs or raised tablets 
chamfered on the sides and deeply channeled with two vertical grooves. The roof 
was low pitched, and in the triangular spaces at the ends, called the pediments, 
were the sculptured groups, which were the most striking external features of the 
Parthenon. 
THE STATUE OF ATHENE PARTHENOS, 
But it was in the interior that stood the greatest artistic glory of Athens—the 
statue of. Athene Parthenos. On it was lavished a wealth of gold and ivory, so 
skillfully-wrought that all thought of the value of the material was lost in con- 
templation of the beauty of the workmanship and the sublimity of the artist’s con- 
ception. The statue itself was 33 feet high, and stood on a basis which raised the 
crest of the helmet to 40 feet. Many writers of antiquity refer to it at greater or 
less length, and Pausanias thus describes it: 
This work of art is in ivory and gold. In the middle of her helmet is an image 
of the Sphinx * * * and on each side of the helmet are griffins worked. 
These griffins, says Aristus the Proconnesian in his poems, fought with the 
Arimaspians beyond the Issedones for the gold of the soil which the griffins 
guarded. And the Arimaspians were all one-eyed men from their birth, and the 
griffins were beasts like lions, with wings and mouths like eagles. But the statue 
of Athene is full length, with a tunic reaching to her feet, and on her breast is the 
head of Medusa worked in ivory, and in one hand she has a Victory 4 cubits high, 
in the other a spear, and at her feet a shield, and near the spear a dragon, which 
is perhaps Erichthonius. And on the base of the statue is a representation of the 
birth of Pandora, the first woman according to Hesiod and other poets, for before 
her there was no race of women. 
Pliny tells us also that ‘‘on her shield he (Phidias) wrought in relief the battles 
of the Amazons on the swelling circuit (i. e. the convex surface), on the concave 
part of the same target (buckler) the combats of gods and giants, while on her 
sandals [he wrought] those of the Lapithe and Centaurs, so completely did he 
make every spot (literally, all divisions) available for art.”! 
In one of the dialogues ascribed to Plato? it is said that the nude parts were of 
ivory, the eyes partly of ivory and partly of stone, and the dress and weapons of 
gold. 
The robe was easily removable, having been made so at the instance of Pericles,

and contained gold valued at forty talents, or about $470,000. Pericles suggested 
taking this gold for the purposes of the war when the Athenians were hard 
pressed by the Spartans,! but the suggestion was made, evidently, to allay the 
fears of the people by recounting the wealth at their command, rather than with 
any real intention of allowing it to be used. The removability of the golden robe 
served an unexpected purpose, according to Plutarch, when the enemies of Peri- 
cles sought to injure him by charging that his favorite, Phidias, had stolen some 
of the gold supposed to have been put in the statue. Pericles at once silenced the 
accusers by bidding them to take it off and weigh it. Nevertheless, Phidias was 
imprisoned later on a charge of sacrilege, it being alleged that he introduced his 
own portrait and that of Pericles among the figures in the reliefs on the shield of 
Athene.? 
THE PARTHENON FRIEZE, 
The frieze around the cella was 520 Attic feet long, and was ornamented with a 
great number of figures, presumably representing the Panathenaic procession. 
This procession was a feature of the festival held every four years in honor of 
“ Athene, the occasion being the presentation of a new peplos to the divinity. The 
figures of the frieze were cut in low relief and were cunningly contrived to avoid 
the disadvantages of their peculiar position in which all the light that reached 
them came from below. Great variety was introduced in the composition; there 
were youthful horsemen, some preparing for the start and others in motion, 
Athenian cavalrymen in full gallop, charioteers, warriors in armor, musicians, 
youths with jars and dishes, men leading sacrificial animals, maidens, marshals, 
magistrates, priests, and, lastly, two groups of divinities. Every degree of motion 
appears, from the calmly conversing magistrates to the rushing charioteers and 
horsemen, but so skillfully are the parts of the procession blended that at no point 
is there any lack of harmony. Another peculiarity of the frieze is that all the 
heads are on substantially the same line, notwithstanding the differences in pos- 
ture and movement; but here again the skill of the artist in the arrangement of 
the figures avoids all appearance of monotony. 
THE METOPES, 
There were originally 92 of the metopes. Their height was uniform, about 4:4 
feet; but their width varied considerably, the average being slightly over 4 feet. 
They show great differences in style and technique, and were not only the work 
of many different hands, but they seem to belong to different periods of art 
development. The supposition regarding them is that they were the first of the 
Parthenon sculptures to be completed, and that they actually mark the develop- 
ment of art during the building of the Parthenon. It is well known that in the 
time of Phidias, and under his influence, Grecian sculpture was finally released 
from the restraints of archaic stiffness and rose to the heights of freedom, 
beauty, and sublimity. And the Parthenon metopes are supposed to mark that 
transition. 
The full meaning of these sculptures is not satisfactorily explained, and none 
of the suggestions concerning them has included a reasonable central idea which 
might run through them all and connect them in a single related series. It is 
conceded, however, that those on the southern side of the building represented 
the battles between the Centaurs and Lapiths. The Lapiths were, according to 
the legend, the ancestors of the Greeks, and Peirithous was their chief. When 
he married Hippodamia he invited the Centaurs to the wedding feast, and while 
it was in progress Eurytus, a drunken Centaur, carried off the bride and caused 
the fights commemorated in the metopes.

1086 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The combats between the gods and the giants are supposed to have been repre- 
sented in the eastern metopes, and the battles of the Amazons are believed by 
many to have been the subject of those on the northern side. There is no satis- 
factory clue to the meaning of those on the west. 
THE EASTERN PEDIMENT, 
The only reference in ancient literature to the groups of the pediments is this 
sentence from Pausanias: ‘‘And as regards the temple which they call the Par- 
thenon, as you enter it everything portrayed on the gables relates to the birth of 
Athene, and behind is depicted the contest between Poseidon and Athene for the 
soil of Attica.”! With this as a basis, endless speculations have arisen as to the 
significance of the different figures. 
But little remains on which to base a judgment of the meaning of the eastern 
group, but it is believed that the moment after the birth of the goddess was taken 
for the representation and that the center of the pediment was occupied by Zeus, 
Hephestus, and the newly born Athene, and that the figures on the sides were 
of the minor deities. In one corner the sun god, Helios, is rising from the sea, ~ 
driving his famous horses, whose heads have just emerged from the water. Next 
to them isthe superb nude figure of a man, commonly called Theseus, reclining in 
an easy attitude upon the skin of an animal. There follow two female figures, 
often referred to as Demeter and Persephone. They are seated, the arm of one 
resting familiarly upon the shoulder of the other. The next is the draped figure 
of a female, and is thought to be Iris, the messenger of the gods descending 
through the air to bear tidings of the wonderful event which has just taken place. 
In the opposite angle Selene, the moon goddess, seems to be disappearing with 
her horses into the ocean, and this, taken in connection with the approach of 
Helios from the other side, is understood to symbolize the dawn of a new day for 
Attica upon the miraculous birth of her patron goddess. Near Selene are three 
female figures, two seated and the third reclining at full length with her arm 
resting upon the lap of the one in the center. These three are conceded to be the 
finest existing representations of the draped female figure, the drapery concealing 
nothing of the beauty of the superb forms beneath, but rather accentuating the 
charm by its own gracefulness and freedom. The arms and heads of all three of 
the figures are gone and we can form but an imperfect idea of their action. Two 
torsos other than those mentioned are preserved, one being that of aman standing 
erect and the other of a draped female, evidently striding forward. 
Nothing remains of the central, the most important personages of the group; 
what became of them, or when, is not known. 
THE WESTERN PEDIMENT. 
Of the western pediment even less remains than of the eastern. The breast, 
shoulders, and back of Poseidon, the torso of a reclining river god, a headless 
female figure leaning against a badly mutilated representation of a god, a part of 
a crouching male figure, another male torso, fragments of horses, and a few mis- 
cellaneous scraps, are all that is left of this series of statues. Fortunately, how- 
ever, we know from extant drawings the position and attitude of nearly all the 
figures. 
The story is that both Athene and Poseidon sought the possession of Attica, 
and it was agreed that the honor should fall to the one who produced the more 
useful gift. Poseidon struck the rock with his trident and a salt spring gushed 
forth. At the command of Athene an olive tree sprang up, and she immediately 
received the award, The sculptor, according to the general acceptation, repre- 
sents this contest before the assemblage of gods on Mount Olympus.

-P-A-G-E-1167
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1087 
The principal figures were those of Athene and Poseidon in the center, and as 
both seem to be preparing to leave the scene, the moment chosen for representa- 
tion was evidently that immediately after the decision. 
The head of Athene and the arms of both figures were missing when the draw- 
ings were made, and the action is therefore uncertain; but Athene seems to go in 
triumph to her chariot while Poseidon, full of anger, retreats toward his. Both 
chariots are awaiting their occupants, that of Athene being hitched to two rear- 
ing steeds and that of Poseidon being drawn by hippocamps, or monsters with 
horses’ bodies and fishes’ tails. 
There were originally eight or nine attendant deities on each side, those on the 
side of Athene being usually recognized as Nike, the charioteer of the goddess; 
Hermes, who stands in the background behind the horses; Persephone and Deme- 
ter, seated with the boy Iacchus between them striving to get away from the 
scene of excitement; then Hebe and Heracles, and finally, in the angle, the river 
god Cephissus, who has been unexpectedly aroused and raises himself gn his arm 
to look languidly toward the center. 
On the side of Poseidon is a figure supposed to be Amphitrite, seated in her hus- 
band’s chariot; next an indistinguishable figure in the background; Leucothea, 
with a child; then the nude Aphrodite seated on the knee of Thalassa, and attended 
by Eros; next is a nereid and the god Illissus, with the nymph Calirrhoe in the 
angle. 
It is noticed that the figures in the angles are apparently oblivious to the drama 
enacted in the center, or take but little interest in it, while the action increases in 
intensity the nearer we approach to the main actors, and in them every muscle is 
tense with earnestness and excitement. 
THE USE OF COLOR AND OF METAL. 
Color was freely used in Doric temples, and the Parthenon and its decorations 
were no exceptions to the rule. Metal ornaments and accessories were used in 
connection with the statues, and many necessary parts not shown in the reliefs, 
especially of the frieze, were undoubtedly supplied with the brush. Athene Par- 
thenos herself was adorned by the painter’s art, and her golden robe is believed to 
have been toned down and shaded so as not to contrast too rudely with the nude 
parts. 
The external architrave was probably left bare originally, but in later years 
shields and a metal inscription were placed uponit. The shields were probably 
those Alexander the Great sent to the Athenians after his defeat of the Persians 
at Granicus; and an American student, Mr. Eugene P. Andrews, recently dis- 
tinguished himself by deciphering the inscription, which was of the time of Nero, 
by means of the position of the holes into which nails had been driven to fasten 
on the metal letters. 
ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENTS. 
In its architectural features there was much in the Parthenon that was not 
apparent to the casual observer, and much that escaped the attention of modern 
students until a comparatively recent date. The precision and beauty of the 
workmanship in even the minutest details and the excellence of the materials 
have long been observed. But unexpected refinements of architecture have been 
discovered from time to time, and the belief is justified that even now all the 
beauties have not been revealed. It.was for a long time assumed, quite natur- 
ally, that the sides of the columns were straight lines, but since 1810 investiga- 
tions have shown that they are bounded by delicate hyperbolic curves, not per- 
captible without close scrutiny, but which have been determined to amount to 
shy Of the height of the columns.

The architrave, too, is curved to form a very flat arch, and the stylobate, simi- 
larly, is curved upward. The pillars are not vertical, but incline toward the 
center nearly a quarter of a foot, and the spaces between them are irregular. In 
nearly every instance the curves, where curves are apparent, were not arcs of 
circles, but were conic sections, either hyperbolas or parabolas. 
All these niceties evidently resulted from a keen appreciation of the effects of 
optical illusion, but the precise reasons for some of them have not yet been dis- 
covered. Though the laws which governed these details be unknown to us, we 
nevertheless feel the effect of their absence in the stiffness and formality of build- 
ings erected in imitation of Greek temples, but without their subtle refinements. 
It is likely that in much that they did, the designers were guided solely by a 
highly developed artistic instinct, and could not themselves have assigned a 
reason. The same acute perception of the requirements of special conditions and 
the same delicate ingenuity in meeting them, that prevailed throughout the con- 
struction of the Parthenon, are illustrated in the story of the statue of Athene 
which Phidias is said to have made in competition with Alcamenes. When the 
rival statues were exhibited on the ground, that of Alcamenes was decidedly pre- 
ferred by the Athenian public, but when they were elevated upon the high col- 
umns for which they were intended, the work of Phidias was so plainly superior 
to the other that Alcamenes became the laughing stock. 
LATER HISTORY OF THE PARTHENON. 
The Parthenon passed unscathed through the varied fortunes of the civil wars 
which distracted Greece, and retained its character as a sacred treasure house 
until after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B. C, In the dissensions and 
wars that followed that event Athens was a conspicuous sufferer. Her degen- 
erate citizens were the prey of first one conqueror-and then another, and they 
treated them all with servile adulation. Demetrius Poliorcetes was quartered by 
the Athenians in the Parthenon itself, and the sacred temple became the scene 
of wild debauchery and licentiousness. He despoiled it of its treasure excepting 
only the vessels and other articles distinctly sacred, but Lachares, who gained 
the ascendency in the city when Demetrius had fled, well nigh completed the 
work of spoliation. He thought only of enriching himself, and nothing was too 
sacred for his rapacity. Pausanias states that he removed the shields from the 
temple, and even robbed the goddess of her golden robe. But he was obliged to 
flee the city suddenly and was not able to take away his plunder; so Athene’s 
robe was restored and the statue was intact several centuries later at the time of 
the visit of Pausanias, which occurred about170 A. D. 
After the treasure had been removed the Parthenon Jost much of its importance, 
but still remained the central point of the Panathenaic festival and the place for 
the distribution of the prizes for the contests. With the decline of that festival 
the prestige of the Parthenon was gone. 
What finally became of Athene Parthenos is not definitely known. Athens 
remained under Macedonian influence from the time of Alexander to the conquest 
of Greece by the Romans in 146 B.C. Under the latter the city enjoyed pros- 
perity; its temples not only remained undisturbed, but others were erected and 
great pains were taken to restore the city to its former splendor. It was only 
after the spread of Christianity that the statue disappeared. After remaining in 
all its glory for nine hundred years ‘‘ with all the freshness of a modern work and 
all the beauty of an ancient one,” it was removed from its place about the middle 
of the fifth century. After that nothing remains to tell us of its fate. The religion 
of those Greeks who refused to accept the teachings of Christ in time degenerated 
into mere idol worship, and when Christianity gained the ascendency the antip- 
athy for the pagan gods was in inverse ratio to the reverence in which they had 
 
-P-A-G-E-1169
  
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1089 
formerly been held. The work of Phidias had especially invited adoration from 
its wonderful beauty and perfection, and it is natural to suppose that it was 
among the first to suffer when the Christians ‘threw down the false gods.” 
The Parthenon became a Christian church in the fifth century, and thereafter 
its character was changed according to the religions of the successive conquerors 
of Athens. Its first dedication as a Christian church was to St. Sophia, but later 
it was called the Church of the Mother of God, and retained that name as long as 
it was held by Christians. Many alterations were made in it from time to time to 
adapt it to its new uses, the principal of them being the construction of an apse at 
the eastern end of the building. This necessitated the removal of some of the slabs 
of the frieze, but they were carefully preserved and placed in a safe position inside. 
After the fall of Constantinople and the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by 
the Turks, the Parthenon once more changed its religion and this time became a 
Mohammedan mosque. Again minor changes were made to suit the caprices of 
the new occupants, and among them the Pentelic marble of the interior was white- 
washed! On the top was erected a slender minaret, from which the muezzin daily 
cried the Mohammedan call to prayer. 
For over two hundred years after the fall of the Byzantine Empire Athens was 
seldom heard of by Christian Europe, and during the entire period of Turkish 
domination but two events occurred to entitle the city to a place -in the annals of 
Christian nations. The Venetians attempted unsuccessfully to capture the city in 
1464, and a similar and more successful effort was made by them in 1687. An 
army under Francesco Morosini had been sent by the Venetian senate into Greece 
after the defeat of the Turks by John Sobieski at Vienna, and had gained a num- 
ber of important victories in Morea. Morosini, in September, 1687, sent a force, 
composed largely of mercenaries, under Kénigsmark, a Swede, to reduce Athens. 
He occupied the city, but the Turks remained in the Acropolis, which they strongly 
fortified, Kénigsmark planted his artillery advantageously, began the bombard- 
ment of the citadel, and soon had effected the ruin of the beautiful structures on 
its summit which had passed through the vicissitudes of two thousand years with 
undiminished glory. The Propylea bore the brunt of the heaviest cannonading, 
the temple of Nike Apteros was entirely destroyed, and a bursting shell caused 
the explosion of a powder magazine in the Parthenon and completed the ruin 
which the steady artillery fire had begun. The explosion wrecked the center of 
the building irretrievably, but the pediments were only slightly injured. When 
he had gained possession of the Acropolis, Morosini, thinking to add to the glory 
of his campaign by sending home such choice art treasures, sought to remove the 
central group of figures from the western pediment; but his soldiers were more 
accustomed to handling artillery than statuary, and allowed the precious sculp- 
tures to fall, shattering them in a thousand pieces. 
The Venetians held Athens but a short time, and when the Turks returned they 
saw in the mass of débris on the Acropolis only a source from which they might 
obtain building material, or a quarry from which they might get stones to burn 
into lime. The Parthenon bore no longer the semblance of a building which could 
serve as a mosque, the highest use which their civilization suggested; and so far 
as any appreciation of its sculptures was concerned, that was not to be expected 
from Musselmans, whose Koran forbids the fashioning of the likeness of any liv; 
ing thing. There was no motive left, therefore, to prevent the complete devasta- 
tion of the remains of the Parthenon by the Turks of that period, so far as it suited 
their convenience and interest, and for the next hundred years and more there 
was a gradual disappearance of such sculptures as were left after that fatal bom- 
bardment of 1687. 
From time to time, before and after that event, drawings had been made by vis- 
itors to Athens of different parts of the Parthenon, and it is to them that we are 
indebted for nearly all our knowledge of some of its features. The most impor- 
ED 97. 69   
 
-P-A-G-E-1170
    1090 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tant of these drawings were made by Jacques Carrey, a French painter, who was 
employed by Marquis de Nointel, the French ambassador at Constantinople, in 
1674, The structure was substantially intact at that time, and though but two 
weeks were granted him, the artist succeeded in drawing both the pediment 
groups, thirty-two of the metopes, and about three-fourths of the frieze. These 
drawings, twenty-one in number, are still preserved in the Bibliothéque Nationale 
in Paris. 
The eastern pediment had lost its principal figures long before the time of Car- 
rey, but when or by whom they were removed there is no evidence td show. 
Turkish limekilns were not the only foes that wrought mischief to the Parthe- 
non sculptures during the period of Turkish rule, for the relic hunter was as 
active then as he is now, and he had no difficulty in securing permission from the 
corrupt officials to remove legs, arms, or other parts of. statues. 
The French ambassador, Count Choiseul-Gouffier, and Fauvel, an artist in his 
employ, in 1797, removed entire a slab of the frieze and one of the metopes and 
sent them to France. Prompted. by this, perhaps, the British ambassador, the 
Earl of Elgin, secured permission from the Turkish Government, a few yearslater, 
for his artists to make drawings and plaster casts and to take away pieces of stone 
with inscriptions. By suitable ‘‘presents” he induced the Turkish mayor at 
Athens to so construe this as to allow him to take away anything he chose. He 
employed 300 or 400 men a day in the work of removal. Everything bearing the 
slightest resemblance to a sculptured figure and every fragment that seemed to 
possess any value whatever was taken, whether it was found on the ground or 
still in its place on the building.! 
The difficulties and annoyances encountered were many and great and the 
expense was enormous, but the British Government finally repaid Lord Elgin 
about $175,000 of his expenditure and the statuary was lodged in the British 
Museum, where it still remains under the name of the ‘‘ Elgin Marbles.” 
Little remains now of the Parthenon on its own stylobate but the badly dam- 
aged columns at the ends and shattered portions of the entablature and pediments, 
Such is the history of architecture’s finest example. It has been described, 
studied, measured, discussed in all its details, enthusiastically and lovingly, 
through centuries ancient and modern. Learned conjecture has been brought to 
bear upon its lost features, and unmeasured admiration is ever expressed for what 
remains. Restorations and reproductions in great number have been made or 
suggested and models are to be found in every art gallery. At least one note- 
worthy attempt has been made to reproduce the color scheme, that of Chipiez, the 
French archeologist, who made the famous 12-foot model for the Metropolitan 
Museum in New York; but it remained for the Tennessee Centennial to be the 
first to build a full-sized model with colors, restorations of the sculptured orna- 
ments, and all in approximate exactness of detail. 
TuE TENNESSEE PARTHENON, 
It is not to be supposed that any claim was made of strict accuracy or that the 
structure was more than ‘‘a model,” as its architect called it. The cella was 
built of brick, covered with ‘‘staff,” the columns were of framework similarly 
treated, and the floor and stylobate were of wood. The structure was intended 
for temporary uses only, and necessarily cost was considered in all things, It was 
to save expense that the frieze was omitted, and a like consideration led to the use 
of the same group in both the pediments, and to the reproduction of only a few 
1 The figures called ‘‘ Hebe” and “Heracles,” in a badly decayed condition, and the lower part 
of “ Calirrhoe” are still on the western pediment, and the horses’ heads, in low relief, remain 
on the tympanum of theeastern. Several of the metopes also remain, but are so defaced as to 
be indistinguishable.
-P-A-G-E-1171

(thirty-three) metopes, which were repeated all round the building, This must 
be taken as an evidence of wisdom as well as economy. For if any attempt had 
been made to-supply the missing figures in the eastern pediment or to design 
metopes to take the place of those that are lost or defaced the result would have 
been disastrous, for the work naturally would not have been the work of a Phid- 
ias. But Carrey’s drawings made it possible to learn enough of the western group 
to reproduce it without jarring faults, and enough metopes still exist in fair 
preservation for their reproduction to give the entablature a satisfactory Phidian 
air if one were not so critical as to object to the repetition, which was not pain- 
fully conspicuous. 
THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT. 
The scheme of classification of the Paris Exposition of 1900 gives the place of 
honor to education, and it is stated in the advance notices that especial attention 
will be given to the educational exhibits. These great expositions serve as models 
for the smaller ones that are held for years afterwards, and it is likely that the 
next century will see better treatment of education than it has had in the past. 
There has been no disposition to slight the claims of the educational material, 
for the authorities of the past expositions have been as liberal as it seemed to 
them wise to be. Nevertheless, agriculture, machinery, electricity, manufactures, 
and the fine arts have had precedence, and education has received what was left 
after the demands of these classes were satisfied. It is a matter of relative values, 
and the announcements from Paris indicate a new relative value to be placed on 
education. It is not to be valued as fourth or fifth in importance, but as first; 
and exhibitors of this class will have cause for rejoicing. 
At Nashville there were educational displays in the Education and Hygiene 
building, the two galleries of the Commerce building, which were not connected, 
the Children’s building, and the Negro building; and, lastly, the exhibit of the 
Bureau of Education, which had no connection with others of the same class, was 
in the Government building. 
The galleries of Commerce were reached only by long flights of stairs, and the 
exhibits in them were greatly handicapped by their inaccessibility. 
In the Children’s building the ground floor was used as an audience hall, a kin- 
dergarten room, and for the display of curios. A great deal of kindergarten work 
was hung on the walls of the audience room. The floor above was occupied by 
some of the exhibits of elementary schools, and for the purpose it suffered from the 
same difficulty as the Commerce galleries, for visitors show an invincible objection 
to climbing stairs. 
In the Education and Hygiene building the exhibits fared better. Nearly all 
the institutions of higher grade had their exhibits there, and being on the ground 
floor they had their just proportion of visitors. The same was true of the insti- 
tutions for the colored race, whose displays were in the Negro building. 
In mentioning individual exhibits, I would refer first to those of the University 
of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University, and the city schools of Nashville. All these 
were admirable in both the matter and the manner of display. The last-named 
exhibit was one of those that were in the Commerce building, but the other two 
were advantageously placed in the Education and Hygiene building. The Uni- 
versity of Tennessee people are experienced exhibitors, and state that they have 
had excellent results from their work in this line. The exhibit was attended bya 
man who was selected for his special fitness in setting forth the facilities and 
advantages of the institution in a tactful and effective way. 
The Peabody Normal School had a very creditable display; and several other 
institutions had their spaces attractively and tastefully furnished, apparently as 
resting places, where visitors might look at portraits of distinguished alumni or at 
albums of photographic views. 
   
-P-A-G-E-1172
  1092 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In the Negro building educational institutions were predominant, and the indus- 
trial side of their work was most prominently shown. Among the most conspicu- 
ous exhibits were those of Fisk University, Lincoln University, Tuskegee (Ala.) 
Normal and Industrial School, and the Industrial and Normal School at Nor- 
mal, Ala. 
The most successful feature of the educational department was the kindergarten, 
conducted daily in the children’s building. The teachers were fully alive to the 
spirit of their work, and the kindergarten was‘a revelation to hundreds of people 
ina section of the country where such methods of instruction are unfortunately 
too little known. Whether regarded as an exhibit pure and simple or as educa- 
tional missionary work in a suitable field; the kindergarten was in every way 
admirable. It was in charge of a young lady who received her training in the 
public kindergartens of St. Louis. 
No attempt was made to hold conventions and congresses under the auspices of 
the Exposition. A number of meetings were held in the Auditorium, but the 
Exposition authorities had little or no connection with them further than to fur- 
nish the place of meeting. Those attending paid for their admission into the 
grounds as all other visitors did. The meetings were encouraged, of course, asa 
source of revenue, but their success or failure was not in any sense chargeable to 
the Exposition itself. 
The exercises on ‘‘ Public School Art Day,” May 7, were the nearest approach to 
an educational convention that took place. Addresses were made by Dr. W. T. 
Harris, United States Commissioner of Education; Miss Josephine C. Locke, super- 
visor of drawing in the Chicago public schools; F. Hopkinson Smith, the author 
and artist, and others. 
THE EXHIBIT OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Since statistics and educational information are the special province of this 
Bureau, the first thought and the most time were given to the preparation of 
statistical charts. They are not the best exposition material, but they are most 
representative of the Bureau’s principal function. <A large chart was made for 
wall display which showed the progress of education in the South for twenty years 
past. The public school system in the Southern States has had its greatest growth 
in that time and the figures of the chart brought out the remarkable strides that 
have been made. Eighty charts were prepared and displayed in ‘“‘ wing frames,” 
about half of which were devoted to the statistics of education in the United 
States and half to education in foreign countries. There were among these several 
charts that were comparative in character, and showed for several countries the 
relative number of male and of female teachers, the relative number of elementary 
pupils, relative illiteracy, etc. 
Allied to the charts in general character were eight large maps of the United 
States, upon which were shown the location of the higher educational institutions, 
the distribution of public school and high school attendance, and of public libra- 
ries, and the percentage of illiteracy in the several States of the Union. These 
maps were very valuable, and were constantly examined by interested visitors. 
Twelve cases of photographs were shown in which were views of typical educa- 
tional institutions classified as follows: Public schools, normal schools, seminaries 
for girls, academies for boys, institutions for the colored race, colleges for women, 
universities and colleges, agricultural and mechanical colleges, institutes of tech- 
nology, and schools of medicine. In each case the institutions represented were 
selected to cover as wide a field as possible, and there were pictures from every 
State in the Union. Comparatively few photographs were included from Nash- 
ville and the vicinity, on the supposition that the schools in the neighborhood 
would all have exhibits of their own, and that Tennessee material in our space
-P-A-G-E-1173
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1093 
would be of little interest. This proved to bean error. The few Tennessee pho- 
tographs in the collection were more popular than all the rest together, and a great 
many visitors expressed disappointment at not seeing more of their home institu- 
tions represented. People in looking through the cases would almost invariably 
hunt for scenes with which they were familiar. I am led to believe, therefore, 
that'a liberal display of the pictures of local institutions would add to the interest 
of such a collection, and by inducing people to ‘‘ proceed from the known to the 
unknown” would make the whole of greater use and value. 
A number of water-color pictures were made to indicate the progress of school 
architecture. They showed respectively a primitive log-cabin schoolhouse, an 
interior of the same, a ‘‘dugout” school of the Western, plains, the ‘‘little red 
schoolhouse” so familiar in educational literature, a city school building of thirty 
years ago, and lastly a typical modern building. These pictures, with the excep- 
tion‘of the last named, were made, and well made, by Mr. Spencer B. Nicholls, a 
young artist of this city. Mr. Edward W. Donn, of the firm of Donn & Peter, 
architects, originated the design and drew the picture of the present day structure. 
The most apparent and conspicuous improvement that relates to schools has been 
in the matfer of equipment. Comparatively few years have elapsed since the pre- 
vailing type of schoolhouse in this country was of very primitive character. The 
rural aspect of the country as a whole and the undeveloped condition of the school 
system operated to associate the school in the popular mind most intimately with 
the log cabin or the simple one-room frame structure. It is unnecessary to say 
that this is no longer true. Typical American life of to-day is life in cities and 
villages, and the representative schoolhouse is the commodious 8-room building 
so frequently seen the country over. This evolution was very well shown by the 
pictures exhibited, and they attracted wide attention. 
The twenty historical pictures of school punishments which were made for the 
Bureau exhibit at the Atlanta Exposition by Mr. Felix E. Mahony were again dis- 
played, and were again an attractive and popular feature. 
That part of the exhibit which related to Alaska was during a considerable part 
of the summer one of the most sought-for exhibits on the grounds. The excite- 
ment caused. by the discovery of gold on the Yukon River was attended by a wide- 
spread desire to learn as much as possible of that little-known territory, and made 
everything connected with Alaska an object of interest. The Bureau's exhibit 
was prepared before the go!d discoveries were made, and for that reason had but 
little to show from the vicinity of the ‘“‘diggings.” But at my request Mr. Will- 
iam Hamilton, the assistant general agent of education, kindly indicated on a 
map the points around which the most of interest is centered, and wrote a letter 
describing the region, the mode of reaching it, etc. Both the map and the letter 
were framed and hung in a conspicuous place, and were nearly always surrounded 
by eager visitors, since that information was not then readily accessible elsewhere. 
Nearly all the material in the Alaska exhibit was furnished by Dr. Sheldon 
Jackson, the general agent of education, and by Mr. Hamilton. It comprised two 
show cases filled with curios, eighty sheets of statistics, photographs, drawings, 
etc., showing as far as possible the conditions of education in the Territory, and a 
collection of water-color paintings of Alaskan wild flowers made by Miss E. Leslie 
Jackson.. The curios included totem poles, models of fur garments, specimens of 
carving, weaving, and needlework, and the like. The native drawings. were 
remarkable for the conception of perspective they displayed, and for an accuracy 
of execution that was surprising in those whose instruction had been of the most 
limited and the rudest sort. But few of the “‘artists” had attended the Govern- 
ment schools at all. 
The flower pictures of Miss Jackson were noteworthy for their artistic excel- 
lence as well as for their botanical correctness, and were much admired. To most  
-P-A-G-E-1174

visitors the most surprising part of it was that there were such flowers in Alaska 
at all, and the exhibit did much to dispel the prevalent idea that Alaska is a land 
of perpetual snow and ice. 
In the matter of installation the changes introduced were more in the nature of 
improvements over old ideas than of radical innovations. The photographs of 
typical educational institutions were mounted on heavy cards and hung in hinged 
frames in neat cabinets. Since wall space was limited, these cabinets were recon- 
structed upon tables, six upon each, and the result was two very handsome pieces 
of furniture. 
Between the space assigned to this Bureau and that of the Indian Office two 
screens were erected, one on each side, with a sufficient space for passage between. 
The screens were 10 feet long and 8 feet high, and were substantial and orna- 
mental. The frames were of polished oak, to correspond with the rest of the fur- 
niture, and the central portions were covered with burlap similar to the wall 
covering. They served excellently for additional hanging space for pictures. 
Wing frames, hung in rows above 8-foot tables, were used for the statistical 
charts and for the Alaska photographs; and the maps showing distribution of 
educational institutions were hung upon self-acting rollers, in wall cases so con- 
structed as to permit the ready examination of any map in either case. 
The show cases used for the Alaska curios were like those commonly seen in 
stores, save that they were of glass on all sides. The frames were perfectly plain, 
though of highly polished oak. The handsome appearance of the furniture and 
the great number of pictures on the walls made attempts at ornamentation for its 
own sake unnecessary. Four groups of Rogers’ statuettes of school subjects and 
a large brass telescope were, however, used to good advantage on the tops of the 
cases. 
I have appended a catalogue of the exhibits in the Government building and, as 
matter worthy of wider and more careful attention than they could receive in the 
exhibit, a number of the statistical charts mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs.

DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT Exurptr.' 
The Congress of the United States, by act approved December 22, 1896, provided 
for a representation at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition by the Government of 
the United States from its executive departments, the Smithsonian Institution, 
and Fish Commission of ‘such articles and materials as illustrate the function 
and administrative faculty of the Government in time of peace and its resources 
as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their 
adaptation to the wants of the people.” To secure a complete and harmonious 
arrangement of the exhibit; the act provided for a board of management, to be 
composed of a representative designated by the head of each department. The 
following representatives were respectively appointed: E. I. Renick, Department 
of State; C. E. Kemper, Treasury Department; Capt. H. C. Ward, U.S. A., War 
Department; Lieut. C. M. McCormick, U. 8. N., Navy Department; J.B. Brown- 
low, Post-Office Department; F. W. Clarke, Department of the Interior; Frank 
Strong, Department of Justice; C. W. Dabney, jr., Department of Agriculture; 
F. W. ‘Irue, Smithsonian Institution and United States National Museum; W. 
de C. Ravenel, United States Fish Commission. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, jr., president of the University of Tennessee and Assist- 
ant Secretary of Agriculture, was appointed by President Cleveland as chairman 
of the board. The organization was completed by the selection of W. V. Cox, of 
the National Museum, as secretary, and H. P. R. Holt, of the Treasury Depart- 
ment, as disbursing officer. 
1 Based upon the description prepared by the representatives of the several departments and 
presented to the president of the Exposition by Mr. W. V. Cox, secretary of the Government 
board of management, on the day of opening.

THE EXECUTIVE MANSION, 
This exhibit is small and for convenience is made part of the exhibit of the 
Department of State. It contains a portrait of the President and Vice-President, 
steel engravings of all the Presidents of the United States conveniently arranged, 
and a photograph of the Executive Mansion. The official working of the Presi- 
dent’s office is shown by a blank form of nomination to the Senate, commissions 
issued for different offices, samples of stationery, the official seal, a warrant direct- 
ing the Secretary of State to place the seal of the United States upon an executive 
instrument, and forms of letters used. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 
The historical archives of this Department contain many rare collections of 
papers and letters written by men connected with the foundation of the Govern- 
ment. There is on exhibition one volume of the Washington Papers containing 
manuscript letters of George Washington, including that of December 29, 1783, 
resigning his commission as General of the Army. This collection comprises 313 
volumes. There is one volume from each of the following collections: The Madi- 
son Papers, in 75 volumes; the Jefferson Papers, in 131 volumes; the Hamilton 
Papers, in 65 volumes; the Monroe Papers, in 22 volumes, and the Franklin Papers, 
in 34 volumes. These valuable documents have all been purchased by the Goy- 
ernment. All of them have been carefully restored, mounted on sheets, indexed, 
and bound in volumes, except the Washington and Hamilton Papers, and the 
work on these is progressing. The Department has in its custody the original 
Declaration of Independence, but this precious document is so faded that it is 
necessary to protect it from the light. A facsimile is exhibited, with 38 portraits 
of the signers. Accompanying these is an artotype copy of the original rough 
draft, containing the interlineations and corrections by Adams and Franklin. An 
artotype reproduction of the original Constitution of the United States, with 36 
portraits of the signers, makes an interesting exhibit. These artotype reproduc- 
tions are so like the originals that they are considered equally good for exhibition. 
There is a fine collection of autograph letters from foreign officials and celebri- 
ties to the President of the United States, among them being Robespierre, Barere, 
Carnot, Louis, King of France, Napoleon I, Jerome Bonaparte, Queen Victoria, 
Alexander I, of Russia; William I, Emperor of Germany; President Diaz, of Mex- 
ico; Ranavalmonicao, Queen of Madagascar; Chulalongkorn, King of Siam. The 
autographs of the Presidents are shown in original proclamations on various sub- 
jects, the only signature lacking being that of President William Henry Harrison, 
who died before signing a proclamation. There is a set of portraits of the Secre- 
taries of State; maps showing the growth of the United States diplomatic and 
consular service; maps showing the expansion of the territory of the United States 
under treaty provisions; Andrew Jackson’s sword; swords presented to the United 
States by Japan and Siam; Malay krises captured from pirates; a large gold medal 
set with diamonds, containing a fine cameo with a representation of Columbus dis- 
covering America, designed and presented to the President of the United States by 
the Sultan of Turkey in commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the 
discovery of America; a statuette of George Washington by Baron Marchetti from 
the original study and model by his master, Houdon, of Paris, in 1785-1790, for an 
equestrian statue, which, according to Thomas Jefferson, then United States min- 
ister to France, was sent to America by Houdon with the expectation of receiving 
an order from the Congress of the United States to have it cast in bronze, but the 
model was destroyed by fire in Washington, leaving this statuette as the only sur- 
vival. Itwas in the possession of the Duke of York, and at the time of the Chicago 
Exposition he presented it to the United States and it was placed in the custody of 
this Department. 
The workings of the various bureaus of the Department are carefully outlined, 
particularly in the passport division, which is of great interest to those contem- 
plating a trip abroad. It shows the forms of passports used by the Department, 
the forms of application for a passport, those to be used by a native citizen, by a 
naturalized citizen, and by persons claiming citizenship through the nataraliza- 
tion of their husband or parent; instructions governing the issuance of passports, 
and a pamphlet (for free distribution) showing the passport regulations of for- 
eign countries. 
THE, TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 
The administrative functions of the Treasury Department may be divided into 
three branches—the accounting, the financial, and the commercial. The first of 
these consists of examining and revising every expenditure of the Government,
-P-A-G-E-1176
  1096 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
and no money appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of the General Goy- 
ernment or any of its branches can be legally expended except upon the approval 
of the Secretary of the Treasury. This branch of the Department, being purely 
clerical, can not be illustrated by an exhibit. 
The financial branch of the Department is illustrated by a complete set of all the 
currency issued by the Government, froma 10-cent shinplaster to a $10,000 gold note. 
The process of coining the money of the Government is shown by operating a coin 
press, which has been in constant use in the Philadelphia Mint for fifty-two years. 
It has a capacity of $90,000 per hour, and in coining a silver dollar strikes a blow 
equal to the weight of 100 tons. A medal specially prepared for the Exposition 
will be coined during the period of the Centennial. In connection with the mint 
exhibit is also shown a complete set of the current coins of 70 of the princi- 
pal nations of the world, and a full set of all the national medals authorized by 
ngress. 
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, in addition to showing all the paper 
money. of the. United States, will exhibit a plate printing press in operation, illus- 
trating the manner in which United States notes are printed, and upon which 
will be printed a souvenir card of the Exposition, showing the White House and 
Capitol at Washington and portraits of the President and Vice-President. 
The commercial branch of the Department has control of all matters pertain- 
ing to the collection of revenue, and, by analogy, Congress has assigned to the 
Secretary of the Treasury the duty of enforcing all laws relating to domestic and 
foreign commerce of the United States, including the Light-House Establishment, 
the Life-Saving Service, the Marine-Hospital Service, the Coast and Geodetic 
Survey, and similar branches of Government business, 
The Light-House Establishment exhibits a more complete assortment of light 
apparatus and furnishings than ever before shown, consisting, in part, of one large 
second-order bivalve lens, weighing over 8 tons, one third-order lens, flashing red 
and white lights alternately, and one fourth-order lens, all of which are shown in 
operation, together with all the lighting appliances in use by the Department. 
The Marine-Hospital Service’s exhibit will be illustrative of the functionsof the 
Government in preventing the introduction and spread of epidemic diseases by the 
establishment of quarantine stations, where all vessels and passengers are exam- 
ined by trained surgeons, and by the erection of Government hospitals for the 
care and treatment of American and foreign seamen. The exhibit consists of 
models and photographs of quarantine stations.and hospitals, hospital furnishings 
and fittings, disinfecting apparatus and surgical instruments. 
The Treasury Department, through the medium of the Coast and Geodetic Sur- 
vey, is the custodian of the standard weights and measures of the United States, 
and, under the authority of Congress, supplies each State with a set of standard 
weights and measures, from which all others are made and tested, and these will 
be exhibited by the Survey, accompanied by models of the metric system. 
The Supervising Architect of the Treasury has control of the design and erec- 
tion of all public buildings, and the exhibit of his office consists of water colors, 
photographs, and sketch plans of the most important buildings erected by the 
Government. 
THE WAR DEPARTMENT. 
The War Department exhibit represents four branches of the Army, viz: The 
Quartermaster’s, Engineer’s, Ordnance, and Signal Corps departments. 
Quartermaster’s Department.—This department exhibits lay figures, mounted 
and dismounted, showing the uniforms of officers and men from 1776 to the pres- 
ent date, and that of a Puritan soldier of 1620; also a case of chevrons, represent- 
ing the various insignia of rank of the enlisted branch; two pack mules, showing 
old and new methods of packing used by troops on a campaign in the far West 
against Indians, and where wagon transportation is not available or practicable; 
silken colors of regiments, battalions, army corps, divisions, and brigades, and a 
silken guidon of the Seventh Cavalry, of Custer fame. 
Engineer's Department.—This department exhibits models of Harlem River 
improvement, St. Marys Falls Canal lock, pontoon bridge apparatus, mortar bat- 
tery at- Hell Gate, block house and lift-gun battery; a number of photographs; a 
series of sixteen transparencies, and a submarine-mine group, showing how our 
harbors and rivers are protected. 
Ordnance Department.—This department displays a light-battery field gun, with 
carriage and limber complete; Gatling gun, with carriage and limber complete; 
field mortar and carriage; gun rack, with large collection of ancient and modern 
guns and revolvers, including those now in use in the Army; samples of the dif- 
ferent swords, sabers, and scabbards used in the Army; cavalry and infantry man’s

  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1097 
complete equipments; armor-piercing shot for 8, 10, and 12 inch rifles; shells for 
7-inch howitzer and 5-inch siege gun; sample boards of fuses and ammunition, 
both reloading and nonreloading. 
Signal Corps.—This exhibit includes the various apparatus used for day and 
night signaling; photographs of arctic scenes; the famous relics of the Greely 
relief expedition—the medicine chest, the seal-skin boots boiled up to make their 
last meal, the improvised scales used to weigh rations, the hatchet and piece of 
flag carried by Lockwood and Brainerd to the farthest north, the oar with its dis- 
tress signal, a sledge made from pieces of boards used by Rice and Frederick in an 
unsuccessful attempt to cross to Baird Inlet to obtain the beef which had been 
cached there. Rice died on this sledge during this trip and was buried in the snow. 
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. 
The exhibit of the United States Navy Department is assembled especially to 
show the present status of the Navy. Nothing is exhibited on account of its his- 
torical yalue only. The few old articles exhibited are only intended to accentuate 
the modern implements of naval warfare. It is endeavored to give this exhibit 
the greatest intellectual value, and to do this prominence has been given to the 
Bureaus of Construction, Equipment, Ordnance, and Steam Engineering, while 
other bureaus have received little or no attention. : 
In the middle of the rotunda is a full-sized model of the military mast of the 
gunboat Helena (a miniature of this vessel being included in the fleet of models). 
This mast carries two military tops, in each of which are mounted two 1-pound 
rapid-firing guns. On theplatform, between the tops, a 30,000-candlepower search 
light is mounted. The bronze ship’s bell, mounted near the base of the mast, was 
made for the U. 8. 8. Canandaigua. Service and international signal flags are 
flown from the masthead. 
Leaving the mast, the first exhibit in the Navy Department space is-a full-sized 
model of a battle ship’s anchor, weight 14,000 pounds, attached to which is a short 
section of 24-inch chain cable, with club link and shackle. At the crown of the 
anchor will be placed a model of the U. 8. gunboat Nashville, made especially for 
this Exposition. This vessel heads the fleet of ship models, in which will be found 
one or more vessels of each of the various types of battle ships, monitors, cruisers, 
and gunboats, with a concise description of each. The lines of these models are 
made with extreme accuracy, and the models themselves show the perfection of 
the mechanic’s art. 
Following the ship models will be found a Howell and a Whitehead torpedo, and 
amain-deck torpedo gun, used in firing Whitehead torpedoes. Adjacent to the 
torpedo gun is a full-sized half-section model of a 13-inch rifle, showing, in the 
section, how the tubes, jacket, and hoops are locked. On line with the bore of the 
gun, and extending to the end of the allotted space, is a rough painting, illustrat- 
ing the penetration of a 13-inch projectile fired with an initial velocity of 2,400 
feet per second, at a target consisting of steel, wood, granite, and brick. Along- 
side this model are shells of all calibers, from 13 inches down, a number of which 
have been fired against armor and ‘show more or less distortion. Model powder 
charges for 13-inch and 6-inch guns, with their cases, are here displayed. Atten- 
tion is called to a sample of one of the return springs for the 13-inch gun, with its 
specifications. A breech block for a 10-inch gun is mounted near breech of 18- 
inch gun. 
Following the line of the exhibit is found a 5-inch rapid-fire rifle, a Hotchkiss, 
and a Driggs-Schroeder 6-pounder, a Hotchkiss 1-pounder, a Hotchkiss revolvin; 
cannon, and a 8-inch field gun on its carriage, all with their ammunition and drill 
cartridges, A few-pieces of old cannon, possessing historical value, serve to show 
the contrast and development of modern ordnance. 
A nickel mode! of the Hichborn turret divides the heavier ordnance from machine 
gunsandsmallarms. The latter consist of a Gatling gun and its successor, the 
Colt automatic gun, the latest and most approved adaptation of the Navy. This 
gun fires the same cartridges (caliber 6 millimeters, or about 0.236 inch) as the new 
Navy rifle, one of which is mounted on a tripod, from which sections of boiler 
plates, showing penetration and efficiency, are suspended. A case near by con- 
tains three of these rifles, which show sections, through the breech mechanism, at 
different positions of firing. 
In front of this case is displayed a Franklin life buoy suspended from a section 
of a ship’s side. Immediately in rear of this is shown a plaster development of the 
Caribbean Sea, and the engraved plate from which charts of this sea are printed, 
together with a portfolio of charts, Ulustrating the chart work of the Hydrographic 
Office. On the wall are displayed pilot, current, storm, and other charts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1178
  1098 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Various instruments of navigation, samples of primers, fuses, pressure gauges, 
and of the various powders used in the service, and other small articles are exhib- 
ited in a show case near by, and alongside this stands the latest type of compen- 
sating binnacle compass complete. 
Following these are seen a propeller blade of the U.S. S. Maine, a section of 
crank shaft of the same vessel, and a steam-launch engine and its propeller. A 
large drawing of the engines of the U.S. S. New York is suspended on the wall. 
Ina wall case are shown samples of the various kinds of rope made in the United 
States rope-walk, at the Boston Navy-Yard. 
A diving suit, with complete equipment of air pump, piping, telephone, etc., 
stands prominently against the rear wall of this exhibit. 
On the side wall will be found four cabinets containing a large number of pho- 
tographs illustrating various subjects connected with the naval service and life 
on board ship. 
Attention is called to the drawing in the center of this wall, illustrating the 
relative strength of the different naval powers of the world. On each side of this 
are numbers of paintings, drawings, engravings, and numerous large photographs 
illustrative of naval vessels and_ scenes, the painting of the Nashville having been 
made especially for the Exposition. 
Besides what is shown in the Government building, the Navy Department also 
has a medical exhibit in the building of Hygiene and Education, which comprises 
most of the hygienic implements used in the naval service, besides models of great 
interest.

indicating the principal features of their work. 
Bureau of Education.—[See report of the special agent. ] 
Bureau of Indian Affairs.—This Bureau attempts only to show its work in the 
Indian schools. Three large showcases, built by Indian pupils at the Indian 
school, Carlisle, Pa., contain articles of handicraft, such as carpenter and black- 
smith work, shoemaking and tinware, embroidery, dresses, beadwork, etc. A 
large, three-seated wagon and several sets of harness are included in the display. 
Patent Office.—This exhibit occupies the center of the square, and, as usual, 
exhibits models of American inventions. The models occupy ten large cases and 
are classified in groups, each showing the infiuence of the Patent Office in the 
development of some particular class of industry. Thus we find agricultural 
machinery, metal-working tools, typewriters, textile machines, woodworking 
machines, guns, measuring instruments, and machines for working clay, for exca- 
vating, for paper manufacture, etc., and a case of chemicals and dyestufis derived 
from coal tar.

resources. 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 
The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution includes also the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, the Bureau of International Exchanges, 
the Astro-Physical Observatory, and the United States National Museum. — It is 
intended to convey a. clear impression of the character and scope of the work 
accomplished by the institution and the bureaus under its direction. 
A complete set of its publications, including those of the Bureau of Ethnology 
and National Museum, forms one of the principal features of this exhibit. There 
are portraits of James Smithson, the founder of the institution; three secretaries, 
Joseph Henry, Spencer Fullerton Baird, Samuel Pierpont Langley, and the late 
George Brown Goode, assistant secretary, so well and favorably known as a 
scientist and for his exposition work. 
The Bureau of American Ethnology.—This exhibit consists of one-half of a 
Kiowa camping circle, with the associated shields and other objects, and is 
extremely interesting on account of the fact that this aboriginal tribe is now the 
only representative of a distinct stock of North American Indians. 
The National Zoological Park.—This park is represented by a large model show- 
ing buildings, roadways, bridges, etc., while in the windows above are enlarged
-P-A-G-E-1181
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1101 
photographic transparencies of objects of greatest interest in the park, including 
buffalo and other animals. 
The Bureau of International Exchanges.—This Bureau is represented by a com- 
plete set of the publications of the United States Government for one year. Fifty 
similar sets are distributed annually by the Bureau to foreign countries. Numer- 
ous: maps and diagrams, illustrating the workings of this Bureau, are also shown.

exterior. and interior of the building at Washington and of the principal instru- 
ments. therein—siderostat, galvanometer, spectrometer, a bolometer or electric 
thermometer, the invention of Professor Langley, and large photographs of por- 
tions of the solar spectrum. 
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM, 
The exhibit of the National Museum is larger than those of all other dependen- 
cies of the Smithsonian Institution combined. It has been intended, as far as pos- 
sible, to show the scope of the Museum and to indicate the manner in which the 
collections at Washington are arranged, labeled, and displayed. It is divided 
into seventeen departments. 3 
The Department of Mammals.—This exhibit comprises a collection of lemurs— 
monkey-like animals. About twenty-five species are artistically mounted, while 
on the walls are casts of the heads of the various species of porpoises and one of 
the smallest and rarest whalebone whales known to exist. 
The Department of Birds.—This exhibit is one of the best ever shown by the 
Museum. It is placed near the main aisle and is notable for its excellent repre- 
seutation of the parrot family, 
The Department of Reptiles and Batrachians,—This presents a group of the 
principal poisonous snakes of the United States, rattlesnakes and copperheads; 
tortoises are also shown. 
The Department of Fishes.—This exhibit consists of a selected series of deep-sea 
fishes, supplemented by a number of casts of North American fishes, colored as in 
life. 
The Department of Mollusks.—This exhibit represents the families of mollusks 
and brachiopods, and shows the utilization of the materials, such as pearl, cameo, 
etc., derived therefrom. 
The Department of Insects.—This is most interesting, illustrating as it does pro- 
tective resemblance and aggressive mimicry. Butterflies take on the color and 
appearance of the leaves upon which they most frequently settle. Aggressive 
mimicry of insects is shown by the imitation in form and color of twigs of trees 
and of insects known to be their enemies. : 
The Department of Marine Invertebrates.—The exhibit of this department com- 
prises sponges, corals, and echinoderms. Suspended from the ceiling are life-size 
models, one of the giant squid and one of the octopus or devil-fish, made familiar 
toeveryone by Victor Hugo’s Toilers of the Sea. 
The Department of Comparative Anatomy.—This exhibit includes two series of 
specimens, one showing the modification of the limbs of animals for different modes 
of life andthe other the structure of the human brain. 
The Department of Paleontology.—This. department is represented by a collection 
of fossils from ancient bothrioepis to modern bony fish, like the shad, and by synop- 
tic collections of trilobites and crinoids. 
The Department of Geology.—A collection from this department illustrates in a 
most striking way the occurrence and association of gold and silver in nature. 
The Department of Minerals.—This instructive exhibit contains about five hun- 
dred specimens of selected minerals. 
The Department of Ethnology.—This interesting display comprises groups depict- 
ing the home life and arts of the Pueblo Indians. A prominent feature of the 
exhibit is a hut occupied by Norton Sound Eskimos. Fine and extensive collec- 
tions of dance masks and types of basketry used by the Indians of the Pacific coast 
are included, as are also specimens of Pueblo pottery and implements for weaving. 
The Department of Prehistorie Anthropology.—This department is represented 
by implementsand objects used by prehistoric man at all epochsand periods. The 
State of Tennessee being rich in implements and articles belonging to prehistoric 
man, the field of American archeology was left entirely to the local archeologists 
and private exhibitors, and the entire display of this department is confined to 
specimens from foreign countries and is about equally divided between the stone 
and bronze ages. 
The Department of Oriental Antiquities,—The display from this department con- 
sists of objects illustrating Brahminism and Buddhism, the principal religions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-1182
  1102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
eastern Asia; Mohammedanism, the literary history of the Bible, and the religious 
ceremonies of the Jews. 
The Department of Technology.—The collections selected for this exhibit consist 
of objects illustrating the early methods of transportation in the Southern States; 
a series of models from the primitive sledge to the introduction of the first railroad 
in the United States, which ran in South Carolina in 1831. There is a model of a 
full-rigged ship with the various sails, ropes, spars, etc., in place and labeled, over 
400 in number, and an accurate and authentic rigged model of the Savannah, the 
first steamship to cross the Atlantic. 
From the electrical collections of the Museum there is displayed _a series repre- 
senting the early instruments of Franklin, Henry, Morse, Vail, and Page. 
Historical section.—Numerous histowcal objects, coins, and medals, illustrating

Materia medica.—This section is represented by instructive specimens of nat- 
ural and cultivated cinchona barks and their products and the alkaloids of opium. 
Numerous transparencies—photographs on glass—illustrating particular fea- 
tures of the exhibits are placed in the windows. 
The National Museum has an interesting ethnological collection of exclusively 
woman’s work among the aborigines displayed in the Woman’s Building, and also 
a portion of the lace collection belonging to Dr. Thomas Wilson. 
UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION, 
The exhibit of the United States Fish Commission is located in the southeast 
corner of the Government building and occupies 5,000 square feet of space in the 
form of an L, It isarranged to show the character of the work performed by each 
of the divisions of the Commission, the method and apparatus employed, and 
results attained, and is classified under three heads—scientific inquiry, fish cul- 
ture, and methods and statistics ot the fisheries. 
In the section of scientific inquiry are to be found models and illustrations of 
the vessels of the Commission, specimens of the nets, dredges and other collecting 
apparatus for scraping the ocean bottom, apparatus used in assorting and preserv- 
ing the collections, a model of the sounding machine used in deep-sea work, and 
samples ot the various thermometers used in physical observations. The results of 
the scientific inquiry explorations of the Commission appear in the form of charts, 
besides specimens of corals, crabs, star-fishes, sea-urchins, and various inverte- 
brate animals; also extensive series of oysters, showing the rate of growth on 
different bottoms, and the method of attachment of the spat and the injuries 
produced by starfish, drills, and other enemies of the oyster. 
Another interesting exhibit included in this section consists of 150 flexible casts 
of fishes painted from the fresh or living specimens in faithful imitation of nature. 
Two groups of sea lions and fur seals are part of this section. 
The methods employed by the fisheries of the South Atlantic, Gulf, and Missis- 
sippi States are illustrated by models of pound nets, seines, spars, hooks, trawls, 
etc. A series of models of vessels shows the development of the fishing vessel of 
the present day from the crude craft first used in this country. The various 
phases of fishing life are illustrated by photographs. 
In the fish-culture section an effort is made to show in a practical way the 
methods followed in hatching the eggs of salmonide, representing heavy éggs; 
shad, representing the semibuoyant types, and cod, representing the floating marine 
eggs. Supplies of shad eggs will be delivered weekly until June 10 from Wash- 
ington and hatched at the east entrance of the grotto. The hatch will be liber- 
ated in the Cumberland River. Trout eggs are furnished from the streams in 
Colorado, and the fish resulting from the same will be in the aquarium during the 
exposition. 
The aquarium, located in the southeast corner of the building, is a grotto-like 
L-shaped structure, 120 feet long, and contains twenty-two tanks. Each tank is 
7 feet long, 3 feet high, and 5 feet wide at the top. An equal number of tanks for 
salt water and fresh water, respectively, are arranged on each side of the grotto, 
with a passageway 12 feet wide dividing them. 
The tanks next to the wall contain many of the food-fishes propagated by the 
Commission, besides a large number of the important food and economic fishes 
of the Mississippi River Valley and from the States bordering on the Gulf and 
Atlantic coasts. In the other tanks are shown most of the important fishes of the 
Gulf, including the snappers, groupers, pompano, crevalle, and mullet, also the 
bright-colored tropical fishes, crustaceans, shellfish, etc. 
The water for displaying the marine fishes was brought from Morehead City, 
N. C., in tank cars, and is stored ina large reservoir tank beneath the floor. From 
this tank it is forced, by means of nickel pumps driven by electricity, into a
-P-A-G-E-1183
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1103 
smaller tank 18 feet above the floor, located in the southeast corner of the build- 
ing. Itis introduced into the aquarium from the overhead tank by means of 
gravity. From the aquaria it returns to the reservoir, first passing through a filter, 
which removes all extraneous matter. As an aid in keeping this water pure, air is 
being constantly forced into it by means of an air pump, operated by hydraulic 
pressure. The air is liberated in minute particles at the bottom of the tanks 
through plugs of basswood inserted inrubber liberator holders attached to rubber 
tubing, which is connected with a pipe leading from an air-pressure tank. 
The fresh water is obtainedfrom an artesian well 84 feet deep, located near the 
southeast corner of the building, which supplies a constant stream of clear cold 
water of 58 degrees temperature. Connections have also been made with the city 
waterworks, so that in case of failure from the well, the aquarium can be main- 
tained in that way. The overflow from the fresh-water aquarium passes into 
Lake Katherine. s 
The interior of the grotto is finished in adamant and cement, partly as stucco 
work and partly plastered, in imitation of a roughly blasted rock tunnel. Where 
the two arms of the L meet, a rotunda has been formed, with a pool at one side in 
imitation of an entrance to a water cave. Itis illuminated by electric lights. Here 
and there in the grotto, mosses, ferns, and other evergreens are planted in the rock- 
work. Two arched portals in imitation of cut stone and of simple architectural 
design form the entrance to the grotto. 
The aquaria tanks are lighted from the rear, and a number of ventilators are 
placed at the crown of the grotto arch. The rockwork of the interior of the 
grotto is in imitation of light trap rock; that of the portals of cream-colored lime- 
stone. with trimmings in darker shades.

The population was about one-half greater in 1895 than in 1875. 
In the public schools the number of pupils was over two and one-half times as great; teachers 
were nearly twice as numerous, females having increased far more rapidly than males. There 
were nearly twice as many schoolhouses, and school pro; eee was over three and one-fourth 
times as valuable. The average school term was twelve days longer, and the total expenditure 
was over two and one-fourth times as much. 
Ninety-six new colleges were established between 1875 and 1895; there were 1,494 more pro- 
fessors and over twice as many students at the latter date as at the former.

THE EXPOSITION AND ITS STRUCTURES. 
Reprinted from an account by Robert A. Halley in the Nashville American, May 1, 1897. 
The site of the exposition could not be more favorably located, and, indeed, 
there was no other location which could have been so improved by the expenditure 
of a similar amount of money. Including West Side Park and adjacent property, 
there are about 200 acres available, and the greater part of this is occupied in 
one way or another. Less than 2 miles from the public square, which is the 
acknowledged center of the city, it is sufficiently elevated to command a fine view 
of the entire western portion of the city and the outlying suburb to the northeast 
and southwest of the city of Nashville. In the distance the State capitol looms 
up in its grandeur and the entire aspect is one that is intensely pleasing to the eye. 
THE SITE, 
When the exposition people took charge they found a park with hundreds of 
trees well kept, and to these they have added hundreds more, which now lend 
their shade to the visitor and suggest the delightful evenings to be spent under 
them the coming summer nights. The beautiful blue grass covers every spot 
which would otherwise be vacant, and through the green borders wind charming 
shaded avenues and walkways. Flowers are everywhere, in beds, in masses, in 
banks, or single plants throw up their heads proudly wherever there is a warm 
spot or a pretty view. Orange trees and lemon trees show their golden or yellow 
fruits, and the palms of the Tropics rear their stately tufts of dark green foliage. 
Cacti fill beds in the sunny corners, and here and there all the summer long will 
be blooms of that strange barbaric beauty and brightness that characterize these 
wonderful children of the desert. Scarlet geraniums, multitinted coleus, and 
fiery nasturtiums lend their glow and color to the beautiful outdoor decorative 
scheme. Through the quiet waters of the lakes glide the gondolas of Venice, 
steered. by the sons of the sunny land where their picturesque garb may be seen 
at home, but where it can not lend a more artistic beauty to the landscape. 
Arbors of native vines, and one arbor where only the strange tropical vines of the 
gourd family grow, offer a cool and shaded retreat to those whose feet have tread 
the walks of the exposition till they tire from the very surfeit of delight. Under 
the trees and in the arbors the sultry heat of the summer may not reach, and 
spring and autumn lend added beauty to the prospect when seen through the 
green curtains of the vines. 
MINERALS AND FORESTRY BUILDING, 
The first building to greet the eye after the visitor has fully admired the pros- 
pect and starts on his tour of the displays is that known as the minerals and 
forestry building. It stands on the space between the northern shore of Lake 
Katharine and the southern extremity of Lake Watauga. It is not only promi- 
nent, but handsome and commodious. It belongs to the Doric order of architec- 
ture as modified by the Romans when they had, attained their highest excellence 
in the art of building. Its size is 526 by 124 feet, with an annex 72 by 162 feet. 
Its main entrances are three in number and each is marked by an imposing por- 
tico with six columns. This gives the building a pleasing general effect. The 
columns guarding the entrances are crowned by sculptural gables in high relief 
and of beautifully appropriate designs, 
The minerals and forestry building is filled with the products of the mine and 
forest, and includes every variety of materials used for building a home, from the 
humblest cabin to the palace. Not only the marbles, the stones, the clays, the 
minerals, the coals, the ores, the precious metals, and the woods of Tennessee, and 
the vast number of their varied products in all branches of industrial art, there to 
be shown, but there will be some of the finest products of other States in the same 
lines. Georgia has a magnificent exhibit of her products in minerals and for- 
estry, and other States have made valuable contributions to thesame work. Two 
structures inside the building are of particular interest—the cabin built of Mar- 
shall County cedar logs taken from a structure which stood for over eighty years, 
and the reproduction of the Ann Hathaway cottage, to be used as Hamiltoi 
County’s headquarters. The State’s display is particularly fine. : 
THE AUDITORIUM. 
West of the minerals and forestry building stands the auditorium, where the 
big concerts and conventions will have possession during the exposition. Witha 
seating capacity of 6,000, it is deemed ample for all gatherings except on special
-P-A-G-E-1185
  
TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1105 
occasions. Colonial in style and Ionicin treatment, its airy porticos, facing the 
points of the compass, give the building the shape of a short cross, except for 
the colonnades extending from the main entrance around in either direction to- 
the ends of the building. Above the colonnades are balconies from which. 
immense numbers of people may view the fireworks at night or the pageants of 
the day. From the tower, 100 feet above the roof, can be had a view of the elec- 
trical effects at night, which will not be equaled by any other view on the grounds. 
In the day from this tower can be had a fine view, not only of the exposition, but. 
of the city of Nashville farther away. The inside finish is of hard wood, and a. 
broad gallery extends around three sides of the hall. The stage and band pit are 
of ample dimensions, even for the great bands engaged and for the great conven- 
tions booked for holding there this summer. 
THE GOVERNMENT BUILDING. 
In the southern part of the grounds is situated the splendid Government building, 
350 by 150 feet in extent, and in the form of a cross. The surmounting dome is. 
50 feet high and very similar to the dome on the new Congressional Library in 
Washington. The Government has not been niggardly in supplying the ways an@ 
means whereby this great public undertaking may be aided, and not only appro- 
priated the sum of $130,000 for the buiiding and exhibit, but has done more. By 
act of Congress it provided for the free admission of foreign exhibits intended for 
exhibition, and this information was transmitted to every foreign Government 
with an invitation to participate in the exposition. It is needless to say that this 
building and its varied exhibits will be one of the most interesting and valuable 
features of the entire exposition. The displays will be on an elaborate scale, and 
commissioners connected with past expositions have been appointed from every 
department, so that the advantage of their experience may be had in this instance. 
The exhibits represent every working department and all will be educational in 
theirnature. The fisheries display, of course, will be the leading attraction to most. 
people, but the models of guns, ships, etc., and the displays of important papers,. 
the show of army costumes from the beginning, and thousands of other objects are 
worthy of anybody’s inspection. 
THE WOMAN'S BUILDING. 
The woman's building illustrates what woman has accomplished in the past 
hundred years. The pioneer’s cabin of logs near at hand, with spinning wheel, 
hand loom, and all the early implements with which women of that day did their 
work, stands as a forcible comparison between the women of then and the women 
of now. Every appliance of modern art, every convenience for the home, and 
every decorative idea for the advancement of the higher tastes will be found in 
the splendid palace whichthe Exposition management has reared to perpetuate the: 
high regard of Tennesseeansfor woman. The Woman’s Building is modeled a little 
after the Hermitage, and some pleasing features of the Grecian architecture have 
been added with fine effect. The building is 160 by 65 feet, and eight massive 
columns support the roof, which is surmounted by an observatory. <A flight of 
steps of pink Tennessee marble lead to the entrance. The surroundings are most 
beautiful, including the splendid Moretti fountain, the three other fountains, 
besides one in the main hall. Of the interior of the building much might be said. 
without giving an adequate idea of its beauty. The assembly room, decorated by 
the Knoxville women, will be the meeting place of the many women’s conyen- 
tions arranged for during May and October. There is a parlor for the president, 
Mrs. Kirkman, elegantly furnished by the contributions of women of the State. 
There is the magnificent main hall, furnished and decorated by the Memphis. 
women; the red-cedar room, decorated by the Murfreesboro women, where relics. 
of the three Presidents, Jackson, Polk and Johnson, will be seen; Chattanooga. 
room, Georgia room, New York room, Mount Vernon room, Colonial bedroom,. 
Oriental room, model kitchen, where demonstrations in cooking will be given 
free during the summer, a display of laces of the world, a vast collection of the 
art works of women in every branch of decorative and applied art; a library of 
the books written by women, the room where the patents and inventions of 
women are shown, the salesroom, where articles for sale are kept, and a number 
of others. All are beautifully decorated and furnished. The halls are full of 
displays from the counties, and many other things are to be seen. 
COMMERCE BUILDING. 
Commerce and agriculture are the two words which appear on the seal of the 
State of Tennessee and the two leading exhibit buildings were therefore very 
appropriately named thus. The commerce building is the largest structure on the: 
ED 97 70   
 
-P-A-G-E-1186
    1106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
grounds, being 591 feet long and 256 feet in width. It is likewise the most strik- 
ing and commodious of the exposition group. The interior is divided into aisles 
and a nave, the former 25 feet and the latter 45 feet high. The central pavilion is 
two stories in height, the second story forming a gallery on either side 145 by 160 
feet, overlooking the nave, and is reached by four broad stairways, one at each 
corner. Tho general style is based on the Corinthian and Ionic orders of the 
Greco-Roman. Over the central pavilion a dome rises to a height of 175 feet. and 
when the elevators are running there will be a grand view of the surrounding 
country to be had from the top. Inside the building is the most elaborately dec- 
orated of any of them, and there is the handsomest line of exhibits ever grouped 
in an exposition. These embrace every article of general commerce and art, and 
come from all the countries of the world. There is a large foreign section, and it 
is filled with rare and costly displays. 
THE PARTHENON, 
It is the Parthenon, beautiful and majestic, that beggars description. The 
most callous and careless observer must acknowledge its splendor, and as the first 
reproduction of that famous building it will bring many thousands of people here 
who have no other incentive to come, Its 58 fiuted columns, its wonderful statu- 
ary, and the absolutely perfect manner in which every detail of drawing, con- 
struction, and coloring are carried out can not fail to interest the visitor who 
comes within sight of it. Inside there is the grandest collection of pictures ever 
brought to the South, aggregating in value over a million dollars. To describe 
this structure and its contents intelligently would require more space than can be 
given in a newspaper article. It stands like a chapter from the ancient times for 
the inspection and wonder of the civilized world. 
PALLAS ATHENE, 
In front of the Parthenon stands Miss Enid Yandell’s gigantic statue of Pallas 
Athene, 41 feet in height, including the pedestal, and modeled after Fruhner’s 
Pallas de Velletri, which is in the Louvre, Paris. This is regarded by critics 
abroad as the most beautiful and most justly celebrated of all. It is the largest 
statue ever executed by a woman. 
THE ERECTHEON, 
The Erectheon, which stood near the Parthenon, was reproduced for the History 
Building, and is one of the really beautiful structures, though not of large size. 
It contains about 4,200 square feet, and is intended to receive only the priceless 
exhibits of an historical nature. Rooms are set apart for the Tennessee Historical 
Society, Daughters of the Revolution and Colonial Dames, Confederate Veterans, 
Grand Army of the Republic, and for miscellaneous exhibits. This building will 
be a center of interest, for the articles will be in every case carefully selected, and 
nothing except of a rare and valuable character will be admitted. 
THE CHILDREN’S BUILDING. 
There is no prettier little building on the grounds than the pretty structure 
erected for the children of the State. The first suggestion of a building for which 
the children should contribute the money and which should be filled with things 
of especial interest to them was promptly met and a considerable amount of 
money was secured. The design is chaste and the interior arrangement adapted 
well for the purposes had in view. The school exhibits of the State from schools 
below the grade of a college will be seen in this building. There is a collection, 
also, of the curios sent for the purpose by United States consuls in many parts of 
the world. During the Exposition there will be entertainments by various schools 
of the State in the Children’s Building, and the first Wednesday in every month 
will be children’s day. 
TRANSPORTATION BUILDING. 
The excessive poetic simplicity of the transportation building is remarkable. 
There are no columns; but the artistic grouping of the masses and proportioning 
has given a very pleasing effect. The structure is 400 feet long and 120 feet wide, 
and stands near the western border of Lake Watauga. Immediately in front of 
this is Lily Lake. The sculpture and relief work illustrate the development of the 
art of carrying from the old creaking cart to the lightning express and even the 
flying machine of the future. The exhibits show what has been done recently in 
 
-P-A-G-E-1187
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1107 
the improvement of transportation facilities and what was done in the initial 
stages of the railroad era, The De Witt Clinton train, the first, will stand side by 
side with the modern locomotive and its train of elegant vestibute cars. Vehicles 
of every variety will be shown in their most splendid finish. 
AGRICULTURE BUILDING. 
The products of the soil of Tennessee will be exhibited in the agriculture build- 
ing, by many considered the gem of the entire exposition group. The Renaissance 
style of architecture has been used, and the dimensions are 525 feet by 200 feet. 
The central dome rises 100 feet, while six minor domes lend a charm to the whole 
which can not be described. Four entrances lead under arches with statuary. 
The classic lines and beautiful proportions can be seen from almost every part of 
the grounds to advantage, and at night the building is particularly adapted for 
an electrical display. The interior decorations of this building have been pro- 
nounced superior to anything ever seen before in the history of expositions, sur- 
passing, according to Chicago people themselves, the best seen at the World’s 
Fair. Within will be the vast and varied productions of Tennessee and agricul- 
tural implements, still and in motion, from nearly every first-class factory of the 
country. The decorations made from field products are especially fine, and each 
of the small domes is decorated with a single product, one in corn, one in tobacco, 
one in cotton, and one in grain. 
MACHINERY BUILDING, 
In the machinery building utility and beauty are united, satisfying the artistic 
tastes and practical demands at the same time. The building is 875 by 138 feet, 
and in outline and detail it satisfies the most fastidious tastes in architectural art. 
There is no steam admitted, that being supplied from the power house, some dis- 
tance away. This will keep the building pleasant on warm days, and enable 
visitors to see it without discomfort. The various machines in operation in this 
building will manufacture a number of things of interest, and one of these work- 
ing exhibits will be a ribbon-weaving loom. The great engines moving noise- 
lessly will be no small part of the interest, as there are some of the finest here 
that were ever made. : 
NEGRO BUILDING, 
The negro building, which many think the most beautiful on the ground, not 
only in situation but in design, is one of the finest evidences that could be given 
of the feelings of the white men of the South for their former slaves. The negroes 
of Tennessee have the opportunity of their lives to make this display educational 
in the highest sense, and this they are doing every day. The building was not 
completed in time for the entire exhibits to be arranged, but since it was turned 
over the negro department has done great work in getting it stocked with the 
many fine exhibits which they had gathered from every part of the State and the 
South. The sight of the building across the fair Lake Stenea is no more beau- 
tiful than the displays within, for the outside of the structure can not tell the 
story that is told by the interior. That story is the story of the negro race from 
the days of slavery to the present—the story of achievement under obstacles often 
seemingly impossible to overcome. The school exhibits and the exhibits showing 
the life of some of the graduates after their school days closed and real life began 
are of notable interest. 
HYGIENE AND EDUCATION, 
The hygiene and educational building was really an outgrowth of the increas- 
ing size of the exposition. The space assigned these two departments was so soon 
filled that the need of greater accommodation early made itself felt. The final 
result was the erection of this structure, and not only has the space been taken up, 
put the gallery of the commerce building has been taken as an annex to the 
educational department. The building is in the Renaissance style, and is 144 
feet square. A peculiarity is that the four sides are identical in finish, and the 
only difference to be aed that on the south side there will be two groups of 
statuary, representing oratory and philosophy. Inside the educational depart- 
ment will be seen the finest and most complete collection of school work ever 
shown at an exposition anywhere. This will include all work done by schools of 
and above the grade of colleges. The lower schools will place there work in the 
children’s building. In the hygiene department will be grouped one of the most
-P-A-G-E-1188
    1108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
unique, attractive and instructive exhibits ever placed before the American public. 
Everything pertaining to the science of health will be exhibited, and it will all be 
of interest to intelligent people. 
ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. 
The building used for the administration building will be abandoned in a few 
days and will then be used for a restaurant and club house. The administration 
building will be the pretty little cottage built about a year ago by Mr. Edward 
pee and here the offices of exposition officials will be kept till the exposition 
closes. 
RAILWAY BXHIBIT BUILDING. 
The railway exhibit building, erected by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. 
Louis Railway, is a beautiful structure at the northwest part of the grounds, and 
exactly 100 feet square. It will contain the terminal station and exhibits also. The 
passengers who come by the railway, either from the city or from other places, will 
be landed here in one of the most complete exhibit buildings erected on the 
grounds. In it are displays, among other things, a sample of everything that has 
been grown profitably in Tennessee. The timbers, the ores, the products of the 
State, are all given space, and form the most complete showing that has ever been 
made of the things which the State grows. The immense log shown is an example 
of what is done down this way in wood. 
EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, 
The Emergency Hospital, back of the clubhouse, will be a very useful place’ 
even if it be never needed. The occurrence of a single case requiring attention 
would be a very serious matter if no such place were provided. Asitis, everything 
has been arranged for prompt attention in any case of accident that may be 
reported. 
MEXICO BUILDING. 
The Mexico Building is a long, low structure in the southern part of the 
grounds, and will be occupied by Mexico, New Mexico, and Chili, as well as by 
any other of the South or Central American Republics. The exhibit made by 
Mexico is far better than that made at the World’s Fair, and contains a great 
many more relics. These are of the greatest interest, as many of them are from 
the Government Museum and have not been exhibited before. 
THE POWER HOUSE, 
The power house shows the finest boiler plant ever set up in the Sonth and will 
supply steam to all parts of the grounds, as well.as furnish the great electric light 
system. It is a place full of interest to those who desire to study the finest plant 
of the sort in the country at actual work. 
PYRAMID OF CHEOPS. 
Near the Parthenon, on the north side, is a gaudy colored building of curious 
construction which never fails to attract attention. It is the reproduction of the 
pyramid of Cheops at ancient Memphis in Egypt. Memphis, which is in Shelby 
County, built it for the county building, and it is not only the headquarters of the 
visitors from Shelby, but it contains the exhibits from that county. 
RED MEN’S WIGWAM. 
The gaudy tepee of the Red Men is a structure that must be seen. Its attract- 
iveness is such that you can not miss it. The little wigwams at the six sides of 
the large central one are for the various tribes found in Nashville, and each is 
painted with the appropriate colors. On St. Tammany’s Day there will be a great 
celebration and a sham battle after the dedication of the wigwam. 
THE RIALTO. 
The Rialto, built from the original in Venice, is an attraction that will be 
doubly attractive when the score of bazars are open for business and the colored 
lights are turned on at night.
-P-A-G-E-1189
  TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 1109 
THE FLAGPOLE. 
The flagpole is the cause of more questions than anything else on the grounds, 
because it is invariably asked: ‘‘How tallis it?” It is 285 feet, and the pole itself 
represents Tennessee. There are fifteen columns around the pavilion at the base, 
each of a different Tennessee wood. These represent the fifteen States that pre- 
ceded Tennessee into the Union. The sixteenth, the flagpole, is Tennessee. 
THE PYTHIAN BUILDING. 
The Knights of Pythias have one of the prettiest headquarters ever built at any 
exposition. In it there will be reading rooms, resting rooms, and all the comforts 
of a home to be enjoyed by members of this order and their families who come to 
the exposition. 
THE PALACE OAR. 
The Seaboard Air Line Palace Car is one thing which is there for a purpose. It 
is the headquarters of all the towns and cities on the line of that road, and in it 
about every ten days some one of the cities will be the host and give a banquet 
which will be attended by citizens of that place and by invited guests. 
THE JUNIOR ORDER BUILDING. 
The Junior Order of United American Mechanics have a pretty building to the 
south of the wigwam and will have everything there for the comfort and enter- 
tainment of their members. 
The Cotton Belt Line has a neat pavilion near the Transportation Building for 
their exhibits. 
The photograph gallery is both attractive and useful, and worth a visit from 
any one who wants a good picture. 
KNOXVILLE BUILDING. 
Capitol avenue is a thoroughfare which has been laid out but a short time, but 
six very handsome structures are either up or nearing completion. The largest of 
these is the Knoxville Building, in which that prosperous city will have head- 
quarters and which will be filled with Knoxville exhibits. It is nearly complete 
and will be a most interesting place to visit. 
ILLINOIS BUILDING, ‘ 
At the far end of the avenue is the fair white Illinois Building, the reproduc-. 
tion of the Administration Building at the World’s Fair, where the great State of 
Tlinois and the great city of Chicago will do the honors during the exposition. The 
forty-eight statues which ornament this building are like those on the Adminis- 
tration Building at Chicago, and cost over $1,000 dollars each to model. Thesame 
models were used for these. 
CINCINNATI BUILDING. 
Directly opposite Knoxville Building is the Cincinnati Building, the first to be 
commenced on the avenue, and it is now about ready for dedication. The people 
of Cincinnati have from the first taken an interest in this exposition, and as soon 
as they became satisfied that the exposition was going to be a success they went 
to work and raised the money for this building. 
NEW YORK BUILDING, 
New York State is about finishing up a building that will be very delightful to 
all visitors. It is commodious and well planned, and the interior decorations are 
in keeping with the character of the structure. The building cost a large amount 
and will be the center of many pleasant times before the exposition closes. 
LOUISVILLE BUILDING. 
Louisville is erecting a building the design for which shows the beauty of the 
idea carried out, and here will be another place where social pleasure will abound, 
The building will be the rallying place for all Louisville people and for Kentuck- 
ians as well, and the close relations between the States will be closer than ever 
before the show is over. 
THE PRESS BUILDING. 
The press of the country has been kind to the exposition, and the management 
has remembered them by erecting for the newspaper men a commodious and con- 
venient place where they may work or rest. The building is of the prettiest design 
and is now about finished.

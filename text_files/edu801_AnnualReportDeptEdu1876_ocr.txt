- REPORT. 
The scholastic reports of County Superintendents are somewhat 
fuller than in 1875, though very deficient in the details required by 
“law, arising mainly from {the impossibility of getting prompt, full 
and accurate reports from the various school districts. Every effort 
‘has been made, from’ this! office, to induce a, prontpt/and exact com= 
spliance with the law, and the result is shows by the follwing

ELECTIONS ON SUPPLEMENTAL TAX. 
Elections were held during the year in 21 counties, to take the 
sense of the people on the question of levying a supplemental 
achool tax. Eleven counties voted against the tax, viz: Fentress, 
Gibson, Grainger, James, Lawrence, Macon, Marshall, Morgan, 
Putnam, Robertson and Wilson. And ten counties voted in favor 
of the supplemental school tax, viz: Bledsoe, Blount, Carter, 
Fayette, Giles, Johnson, Knox, Loudon, Maury and White. 
Average supplemental poll tax in 46 counties, .83.7. Average 
supplemental property tax in 47 counties, .13.3 on $100 worth of 
property. The average privilege tax could not be ascertained from 
the reports from counties not having been made in sufficient detail. 
For more particular detail, reference may be made to the latter, in 
the Appendix, which embody the figures from each county. 
LESSONS FROM THE SUMMARIES. 
A careful consideration of these statistical figures, which should 
be {studied .as conveying valuable lessons, will convey encourage- 
ment as to the success of our public school system, throughout most 
of the counties of the State, and especially in those counties which 
have levied a sufficient supplemental tax to continue their schools 
from five to seven months, and have provided for wise and intelli- 
gent supervision of their schools. From a few counties, reports 
show that no organization of the system has taken effect, so as to 
develop a solid public sentiment in its favor. No tax has been 
levied, and no effort made to encourage the County Superintendent 
to labor zealously and efficiently. CBut in a greatly larger number 
of counties the work has gone on vigorously, and a system of edu- 
cation has been organized, which promises a progressive develop- 
ment fully equal to the best wishes of its friends and of the people

at large. Success is no longer a problem, but a fixed fact.) There 
is a slight deficiency in the enrollment and average attendance of 
pupils, as compared to 1875, which arises mainly from the instruc- 
tions given to school officers, by a cireular ;issued from this office, 
June 1, 1875, which resulted in a suspension of schools in some 
‘school districts, where the directors had made an over-estimate of 
the accruing school revenue, and had thereby incurred a considera- 
ble indebtedness to teachers. It was adjudged better to suspend 
the schools in such districts, until the indebtedness could be can- 
celled and a sufficient fund should be coming in to meet the run- 
ning expenses of the schools, in cash. The terms of these instruc- 
tions were as follows: 
“Another measure, which I recommend to County Superintend- 
ents, is to make out each year, before any contracts are entered 
into with teachers, an estimate of the amount of the school money, 
from all sources, which will probably be apportioned to each dis- 
trict in the ensuing year, or require the Directors to do the same, 
taking as a basis the actual apportionments of the preceding year, 
provided ‘no change has been made by the county in the levy of 
taxes. If any change in the levy has been made, then the estimate 
may be increased or diminished accordingly. But it will always 
be more prudent to under-estimate the apportionment. than to ex- 
ceed the amount. There is scarcely any circumstance which con- 
tributes more to cast odium upon the system than unliquidated 
indebtedness to teachers, who have earned their salary by their 
services, And there can be nothing which so greatly discourages 
teachers themselves, and dampens their ardor. After such estimate 
has been made, the amounts first received should be set aside to pay 
any accrued indebtedness to teachers or others, and contracts should 
only be entered into to consume the- balance of the year’s estimate 
remaining, after paying off the indebtedness. 
“Tt this system be strictly observed, all indebtedness will be can- 
celled, and the schools will hereafter be conducted free from the
-P-A-G-E-11
10 REPORT OF THE * 
incubus of debt, which has proven the blight of both private and 
public enterprises. Iam induced to make and urge this recom- 
mendation from the numerous instances which have come to my 
knowledge of gross carelessness in making contracts, reckless as. 
they have proven of the rights of individuals, and tending to bring 
our school interests into disrepute. County Superintendents are 
directed to make reports, under the head of “ remarks,” with regard 
to the indebtedness of any districts in their counties, (designating 
the districts), and whether this recommendation has been ob- 
served,” 
These suggestions, issued before the contracts were entered into 
with teachers for the scholastic year 1875-6, were very generally 
observed by school officers, and in many districts the schools were 
suspended, until the indebtedness could be cancelled and a surplus 
accumulated with which to carry on schools in the ensuing year. 
" The result is plainly shown in the reports of the County Superin- 
tendeuts, whose balances of cash on hand, on September 1st, 1876, 
aggregate the sum of $141,174.47, all but seven counties reporting 
a handsome balance, while they report an indebtedness, aggregating 
$8,680.75; leaving a net balance over indebtedness, of $132,493.72. 
This constitutes a good fund with which to commence the school 
year on Ist of September, 1876, and with the current accruing re- 
sources and good management, must result in a fairer and more 
favorable test of our system than has been heretofore practicable or: 
even possible. The counties reporting an indebtedness are, Bedford, 
Grundy, Clay, Johnson, Obion, Putnam and Rutherford. 
EXTERNAL ECONOMY OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
I have endeavored earnestly, within the past two years, to collect 
all the available statistics, with regard to private schools, which 
could be had in the absence of legal authority to demand reports 
from such institutions, with the view of comparison to the public 
schools in the matters of enrollment, attendance and cost. The
-P-A-G-E-12
‘ 
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 1t 
object of the State government in fostering a system of public 
schools is not to destroy or even injure the cause of private instruc- 
tion, where it is preferred by the guardians of the children. Even 
in States where a compulsory system of education has been adopted,. 
attendance upon free public schools has never been claimed or en- 
forced. All that has ever been required has been to educate all the- 
children by such methods as should be most eligible to those having- 
the responsibility of rearing and training them. Public school sys- 
tems have been organized and are maintained in all the civilized. 
States of the world, only because a vast number of their inhabitants 
are either unable or unwilling to incur the expense and sacrifice of 
imparting to their children such instruction as will fit them for so- 
cial, civil and industrial duties, and rescue them from the wretched: 
fate which ignorance and vice entail upon their victims. 
In the progress of the great educational movement to which this. 
noble principle of statesmanship has given birth, it has been dis- 
covered that the organized effort and supervision by which public- 
school systems have been created, have not only, by discussion and: 
publicity, given to them improved school methods and discipline,. 
secured abler and better teachers, in the aggregate, and given a new 
and nobler impulse to the aims of statesmanship, but have very- 
materially reduced the cost of education, not only in public, but 
also in private schools. This fact has been well known to educators. 
wherever the free school system has taken deep root and had time 
to develop its fruits. 
But in our own State, we have not heretofore had any authentic- 
data upon which to base such a conclusion. In 1875 I issued in-~ 
structions to the County Superintendents to furnish the facts from 
their own counties, with the view of making a just comparison. 
Complete or partial returns from the twenty-six counties which fur- 
nished the reports asked for, established the fact that the average. 
cost of tuition per pupil for each month taught, was $2.84. I do 
not suppose that these returns were entirely accurate ; for I am fully 
aware of the difficulties which must be encountered in ascertaining:
-P-A-G-E-13
12 REPORT OF THE 
the exact figures. But that they were approximate, I do not enter- 
tain a doubt, and that the error (if there was any) was in deficiency 
rather than excess, I am equally as confident—from personal knowlh 
-edge of the rates of tuition in private schools. But the returns 
embodied in this report, (1876), are much more in detail, fuller, and 
have been gathered with more care and diligence. These returns 
-embrace sixty-six counties, and are ‘given fully in Table TX in the 
appendix. The reports from which they are consolidated mostly 
specify the districts in which the schools are carried on, and must 
therefore be accepted as a fair approximation, if not entirely accu- 
rate. From them it is ascertained that the average rate of tuition 
per pupil foreach month taught, in 1.083 private schools of sixty- 
six counties, in which are enrolled 31,416 pupils, is $1.79, ora 
fraction over 93 cents per pupil per month in excess of the rate of 
tuition per month paid for the 194,180 enrolled pupils of the public 
schools of Tennessee. And these figures represent only the rate of 
tuition, or the teachers’ fees; while the 85.6 cents which is the cost 
per month of each pupil in the public schools represent the entire 
-expense of operating the free schools, excepting the cost of improve- 
ments, or school-houses, sites, ete. 
Now if this excess of cost in educating one child for one month 
(93) be multiplied by the number of children enrolled in the free 
public schools of the State, viz: 194,180, it will be seen that there 
is a saving to the public of $180,587.40 in one month. And if this 
-excess (93) be further multiplied by 31,416, which represents the 
number of children enrolled in the private schools of sixty-six 
-counties, there will be shown an additional saving of $29,216.88, 
which added to the saving of $180,587.40, will develop the solid 
saving of $209,804.28 on the public schools and private pupils in 
the State, provided these private pupils were educated in the publie 
schools. , 
In addition to this showing, it appears that the competition of 
‘public schools has reduced, in one year, the cost‘of tuition per 
anonth from $2.84 to $1.79, equal to $1.05 per pupil per month.

This is all that is claimed for public schools by their most ardent 
advocates, and completely vindicates both their economy and their 
influence in cheapening the expense of education for those even who. 
prefer private teachers for their children. I do not refer to these. 
facts for the purpose of depreciating private agencies in education,. 
nox still more with the view to lower the wages of teachers, which 
ought to be more remunerative than they are; but I introduce them. 
as the natural corollary from the statistical records in this report, 
and with the farther view to show to the masses of the people that 
the most economical method they can adopt to educate their charges,. 
is through the agency devised and carried into operation by the 
General Assembly of the State. 
This saving of $209,804.28 per month, in five months would. 
amount to $1,049,021.40, which would be a sum more than sufficient 
to pay the expense of all the public schools in the State, at the pre- 
sent cost, and with the present enrollment. : 
The enrollment, in the sixty-six counties reporting private schools,. 
would indicate an enrollment of about 45,000 in private schools, in 
the ninety-four counties, which added to the enrollment in the pub-- 
lie schools, equals 239,180, in public and private, schools, in- the 
whole State, which is about 55 per cent. of the school population.. 
I have no data upon which to estimate the average length of time. 
of attendance at the public schools, during the school years, from 
6 to 18 years of age. But it may be supposed that not more than, 
one-third of the enrolled pupils attend the public schools over four- 
years of their school] age, which is one-third of the term between 
six and eighteen. In a period, therefore, of twelve years, even 
under our present unperfected system, if this hypothesis be correct,. 
nearly the entire school population of the State would be in the- 
public schools some time within their school age. 
INTERNAL ECONOMY OF SCHOOLS. 
But-economy in the cost of public schools would be a poor satis- 
faction to the people who decreed their organization and support

them by taxation, were there not to be found an internal economy 
in their discipline and method of sound instruction which should 
‘compensate for the expenditure. It is on this very point that there 
is claimed for them, in their average results, a superior organiza- 
tion. In districts where great or partial ignorance prevails among 
the adult population, the schools must be inferior, unless there is 
‘pressed upon them a public responsibility, judicious inspection, and 
wise supervision. They must be inferior, at any rate, to those in 
more favored localities, if their immediate management depends 
‘upon ignorant and incompetent local trustees. But with all sur- 
rounding circumstances equal, it has been established by experience 
in every State where the system has been soundly organized, that 
the average public free school affords higher opportunities for edu- 
‘cating the youth of both sexes than the average private school. 
It has therefore followed, in these instances, that private schools of 
the same grade disappear, in the same community, before the public 
‘schools, excepting in cases of superior excellence and established 
reputation for ability and thoroughness. In making such a com- 
parison, we must take into the account only schools enjoying the 
same surroundings and advantages. In any community where un- 
due parsimony prevails, where the superintendent and inspectors 
are of inferior qualifications, where the buildings and apparatus are 
incommodions and unsuitable, and where, as a consequence, the 
teachers cannot be expert, in theory or practice, we may not antici~ 
pate favorable results, The reverse will appear where the condi- 
tions are different. But the skillful and successful management of 
a vast system of public schools will as surely. depend upon an able 
administration of their various and complicated details in each lo- 
eality and district where they exist, as will any other great enter- 
prise or business draw its vitality and success from its administra- 
tion. The internal economy of public schools cannot prosper with~ 
out able, well-sustained, and active supervision and inspection. 
School reports only show results as to attendance, receipts, disburse- 
ments and per centages. All the machinery and appliances by
-P-A-G-E-16

which they are collected will be utterly worthless, so far as concerns 
. sound instruction, unless the internal arrangements of every isolated 
establishment which draws its sustenance from the public bounty 
are looked into, weighed, encouraged and approved, or corrected 
and improved.. The schools, both in the midst of busy marts and 
in obscure and out of the way corners, must be sought out by honest 
and competent supervisors, and the spirit of the teachers must 
_ thereby be noted, their methods observed, the manners and discip- 
pline of their pupils looked at, the character of their school build- 
ings and out-houses, as to ventilation, warmth and neatness seru- 
tinized, and the entire character and training they impart, seriously 
inquired into by a living observer—one of trained eye and solid 
 aequirements. No mere report, either written or oral, can convey 
to the supervisor or superintendent the valuable knowledge thus 
gained. And no mere circular or message can impart to the teacher 
or his school the encouragement or the correction (honestly desired 
by any one willing to advance himself in his profession and ambi- 
tious to attain excellence) which such visitations communicate. 
The supervisor or superintendent must himself be thoroughly com- 
petent, that his important mission may be successful and improving. 
He must be a person “of literary and scientific attainments,” as our 
law emphatically directs, and therefore must not be one who has 
attained the position by making the lowest bid to the County Court, 
thus lowering the standard of official qualification as certainly as 
though the badge of the administrator of one of the most important. 
laws on our statute books were hung up under the auctioneer’s 
hammer. In communities and counties where the office of super- 
intendent, supervisor, or inspector is thus despised and trifled with, 
good results or satisfactory instruction are not to be seriously looked 
for; nor are they realized. It is only where’ men of the highest 
qualifications as educators and administrators—men of organizing 
eapacity and of comprehensive views and high aims—honest, earnest 
and able men are sought for, that the great living power of super- 
vision, organization and subordination can be utilized and brought
-P-A-G-E-17
16 REPORT OF THE 
into available operation, Such men must be paid living wages for 
their valuable services, and the money thus expended upon procur- . 
ing their interposition, mediation, organization and supervision, will 
be instrumental not only in securing that internal economy indis- 
pensable to a sound school system, but also in guaranteeing a true 
external economy. While it will cheapen cost and expenditure, it 
will advance and enhance, beyond the calculations of arithmetic, 
the highest welfare of the youth of the State who shall be entrusted 
to their guardianship. Without such supervision there is no ac- 
countability in the multiplied agents who have been selected to 
perform the most important functions known to the social condition 
of civilized man. The State which furnishes the means to execute 
so great a work—one in which is: involved its own future good 
order and social, as well as political, well-being—ought surely to. 
provide the instrumentalities which will supervise its proper and 
efficient execution, and demand the strictest accountability, both 
from its moral and financial agents. It can know nothing of the 
success of the.work for which it provides material aid, and can do. 
nothing to correct abuses, mismanagement, or mistake, without such 
accountability. “Indeed, it is not too strong to assert that the aban- 
donment of such supervision is equivalent to the abandonment of 
an efficient free school system; and it may be predicted, with cer- 
tainty, that the tax-payers will soon grow weary of wasting treasure 
upon a system of which nobody will have any knowledge, and for 
which nobody has any care or concern. And it may, with equal 
certainty, be affirmed that those who advocate such abandonment 
are either consciously or ignorantly the most determined, because 
_ the most insidious and dangerous enemies of free schools whose pur- 
pose is, or should be, to keep pace with the great movement of 
progress in education, which to-day agitates cvery free and enlight- 
ened State on the American and European continents. No direct 
and open assault can ever accomplish what this undermining move- 
ment hopes to effect against a system which needs to be perfected 
and developed, instead of assailed and stabbed in its most vital

parts. I should be untrue to my trust did I not warn the General 
Assembly, through this report to the Governor, of this well-ma- 
tured plan to emasculate the law, by which their predecessors have 
‘endeavored to place the children of Tennessee upon a plane of op- 
portunity equal to that enjoyed by their sister States of the Union. 
Every such covert movement, whether made through ignorance or 
design, should be unmasked, and made to assume its true purpose 
or its inevitable tendency and consequence. 
SOME PRACTICAL AMENDMENTS. 
The experimental operation of our free school law has demon- 
strated the necessity of some changes, not radical in their character, 
and tending to a retrenchment of expenditure, and which, at the 
same time, will render it more efficient in practice. Such amend- 
ments have been well matured by those who have had the oppor- 
tunity to observe defects in its working. . It is deemed important 
in order to secure greater unity and zeal in the system of each 
county, and more accurate, prompt, and complete reports of school 
work and financial operations, that a County Committee of Direct- 
ors should be established and organized with all the powers now 
entrusted to the District School Boards, excepting the power to 
select and contract with teachers, visit schools and take care of 
school property, to be elected by a convention of the District Di- 
rectors, and of which the Chairman of the County Court shall be 
ex officio Chairman. 
The County Superintendent of schools should be ex officio Secre- 
tary and executive officer of said Board, and he should be paid for 
“his services by fees allowed for the examination of teachers, by a 
commission for disbursing the school fund of the county among the 
school districts, of which he should be treasurer, and a fee for visit- 
ing and inspecting schools, and reporting the details of his exami- 
nation of such schools to the State Superintendent, according to a 
form to be prescribed. He should be required to give bond, with 
2

sufficient sureties, to be approved by the County Court, and to hold 
County Institutes for instruction and counsel. The expense of such 
‘County Committee would be much legs than the present mode of admin- 
istration by District Boards, and would be incomparably more vig- 
orous, satisfactory, and efficient. The State Superintendent should 
also be authorized by law to hold general Institutes in fixed divi- 
sions of the State. I submit these amendments with confidence 
that they will improve the administration of the law, cheapen its 
cost, and render its working more satisfactory in elevating the 
standard of instruction. , : 
INSTITUTES. 
I have held general Institutes at various points in the State, 
‘during the last year, without special legal authority, and without 
expense to the State, and have had the satisfaction to observe that, 
in every case, they have had a healthful and -encouraging in- 
fluence on public sentiment, and in raising the enthusiasm and 
quickening the intelligence of the large bodies which have attended 
them. Ihave thus been encouraged tg devise a more systematic 
plan for extending their advantages into every portion of the State, , 
and have accordingly issued a circular addressed to County Superin- 
tendents, and providing for holding one or more general Institutes 
in each Congressional District, and herewith ask legislative sanc-— 
tion to the same, which will tend to give higher authority to their 
sessions, and to enlist more fully official co-operation from school 
officers and teachers. It is impossible for the State Superintendent 
to visit each of the ninety-four counties of the State, and to attend 
to the indispensable business accumulating in his office, and his 
necessarily large and increasing correspondence with the various 
district and county school officers. Indeed it would consume his 
whole time to make such visitations, leaving no opportunity to dis- 
charge office business, which will hereafter entirely devolve upon 
him, in view of the fact that the aid appropriated to the o ffic 
four years past by the Peabody Fund has been withdrawn.

NORMAL COLLEGE. 
I would respectfully ask attention to the report of the Secretary 
of the Board of Education, embodying the operations of the State 
Normal College for the last school year. I take pleasure in bearing 
-emphatic testimony to the high skill and scholastic ability with 
which this noble institution, founded and endgwed by the joint 
amunificence and public spirit of the Peabody Trust and the Uni- 
versity of Nashville, has been conducted, as well as t6 the great 
‘work upon which it has successfully entered, of furnishing for the 
State able, worthy and efficient teachers for our free schools. The 
providing of such teachers for nearly four thousand schools is no 
‘holiday task, and demands the wisest co-operation and the most 
‘earnest zeal of all who wish to bring the schools to a high standard 
‘of usefulness and,success. As in my first annual report, I renew 
the recommendation in favor of a liberal, fostering care to an insti- 
tution whose beginning has been so auspicious, and which promises, 
in the future, to realize the most sanguine expectations of its found- 
ers and benefactors. It is a free school of the highest order, but 
its endowment being only provisional, will require a wise provision 
for the future from the General Assembly. 
GEOLOGY OF TENNESSEE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
The Public School Law prescribes, as one of the branches to be 
studied, “ Elements of Geology of Tennessee.” When the law was 
passed there was not in print a text-book on this subject. Within 
the last two years two good text books have been supplied. The 
practical difficulty which confronts us now is the want of qualified 
teachers. The Normal College proposes to partially supply ‘this 
need by training its pupils in the desired study. So important is it 
regarded to the future welfare of the State, that, if competent teach- 
rg cannot otherwise be provided, it should send out to Insti- 
tutes, for the instruction of teachers, lectures on this branch of
-P-A-G-E-21
20 , REPORT OF THE 
science, as has been done in England. The importance and neces— 
sity of this study are graphically set forth by Col J. B. Killebrew in. 
the following extract : 
“The study of the crust of the earth, which is the object of 
Geology, is at the same time one of the most interesting and one of” 
the most important that can engage the attention of rational crea- 
tures. The soils which produce our food, the coal which warms our ‘ 
homes, the ores ffom which the machinery and utensils of civilized 
life are made, the stones and clays from which our buildings 
are constructed, the gems and precious metals that are used for 
ornament, or as the basis for our currency—all these are matters 
properly treated of in a work on Geology. The habits of observa- 
tion and investigation which the study of Geology engenders, and’ 
above all the great army of eager enquirers into the hidden resources. 
of the State, which should yearly go out, are sufficient reasons why 
Geology should take its place among the studies of our schools.” , 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCHOOL LAW. 
A large portion of the time of the State Superintendent is: 
consumed in deciding cases of controversy arising from disputed 
constructions of the law in the different school districts. The most 
careful consideration has always been given to these controverted 
constructions, or when doubtful points have arisen ; and the decisions. 
rendered have uniformly been acquiesced in, and, in some instances, 
it is known, have prevented expensive and troublesome litigation. 
Two cases involving points of law, which were complicated in the 
general statutes, were referred to the Attorney General of the State, 
and prompt and lucid opinions rendered by that officer. It is be- 
lieved that the publication of all these decisions, in a pamphlet 
volume, would tend to prevent future litigation, and to enforce. 
throughout the State a uniform practice in interpreting the ‘school 
law, and preventing disputes and litigation. If authorized by the. 
General Assembly, this will be done. *

PEABODY FUND. . 
The appropriations from the Peabody Fund to free schools in the 
State for 1875-6, were made to the schools detailed in my first 
‘annual report. The amounts were paid to all the twenty-six schools 
mentioned in said report, with the exception of five schools which 
‘failed to make certificate of compliance with the conditions of the 
‘appropriation.’ The amounts to be appropriated, for the year 
1876-7, have not been apportioned to the schools which have ap- 
plied.. In consequence of the disproportionately large appropria- 
‘tions made to the schools of the State in the past, the aggregate 
‘appropriation for 1876-7 will be perceptibly smaller, though still 
vaffording a decided stimulus to the organization and maintenance of + 
free graded schools, which is the special work to be encouraged by 
the distribution of this beneficent fund. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, 
The annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association for 1875, 
was held at Knoxville on 26th, 27th and 28th December. The 
meeting was numercusly attended by educators and teachers in the 
Eastern Division of the State, by Dr. T. W. Humes, President of 
‘the East Tennessee University, Hon. John M. Fleming, ex-State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and others. The meeting 
-was also attended and addressed by City Superintendent Mallon, 
Atlanta, Georgia; Prof. R. W. Jones, of Virginia ; State Super- 
aintendent Henderson, ‘of Kentucky; Dr. B. Sears, General 
Agent of the Peabody Fund, and others. Resolutions were 
adopted unanimously, proposed by the State Superintendent of 
‘Tennessee, and. reported by him from the Committee on Memo- 
rials, embodying, in substance, though not in detail, the amend- 
ments to the School Law suggested in this report, and. which’ 
are respectfully recommended to the favorable consideration of the 
‘General Assembly. They are not merely theoretical changes, but 
‘contain practical remedies for admitted defects in the law, and will

remove, if adopted, serious obstacles to its efficient working. Hon 
Jas. T. Leath, Superintendent of City Schools, Memphis, was. 
elected President of the Association. 
UNIFORMITY OF TAXATION. 
It is scarcely necessary to state—what is so well known to all—- 
that the pro rata of the counties of the interest on school fund, the 
one-mill State tax levied for school purposes, and the State poll tax,. 
are not sufficient to carry on the public schools longer than from 
two to three months in the year; and especially is that the case when 
neither the one-mill tax or poll tax are scrupulously collected, or- 
are, as is sometimes true, used for general county revenue purposes,. 
.as I have been unofficially informed. In consequence, the wise 
intention of the Legislature “ to establish a uniform system of pub- 
lie schools,” throughout the State, is defeated by the action or the- 
non-action of the County Courts. There are two remedies for this. 
deplorable delinquency: 1st. The General Assembly may levy an- 
additional one-mill tax on property, throughout the State, which. 
will only be practically operative on those counties which have- 
levied no supplemental county tax; or 2d, it may enact that no. 
county shall be entitled to receive its pro rata of the interest on the 
sehool fund until it shall levy such additional one-mill tax, or until 
said county’s share of the fund shall amount to enough to carry on- 
schools for five months. This latter plan has been tried in some of the- 
States, and has, as I am advised, acted as such a stimulus upon the- 
county authorities, that they have all, within a reasonable period, 
levied the required tax and fallen into the line of progress. In 
view of financial exigencies the General Assembly can best judge- 
as to the wisdom of applying either of these remedies at present. It 
should also be made the duty of the County Superintendent to take. 
care that every tax, required by law, should be regularly assessed,. 
collected and paid over, under the penalty which the Code prescribes, 
when the County Trustee fails to pay over other moneys to parties. 
entitled to them. The County Court should also be deprived of alk
-P-A-G-E-24
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 23 
power to draw warrants upon the school money, under a sufficient 
penalty against the Trustee, if he shall not resist and refuse to pay 
such warrants. 
ESCHEATED PROPERTY. 
' Section 34 of the School Law, 1873, provides that “To the per- 
manent State fund may be added, from time to time, the proceeds 
of all property accruing to the State by forfeiture, of all lands sold 
and bought in for taxes,” etc. It is deemed important that some 
more detailed legislation should be made, in order that the proceeds 
of such estates should be covered into the treasury for the benefit of 
the school'fund, and should be held in custody for rental, when it 
it is not thought wise to convert them, by such officer as the law may 
direct. If the County Superintendent should be made a bonded 
officer, it would seem proper that he should be made the custodian 
of such property, under the counsel and orders of the County Com- 
mittee of Directors contemplated by amendment to the law. Refer- 
ence is made to a decree of escheat which was determined by the 
Supreme Court at its January Term, 1876, as showing the necessity 
for some more definite legislation. 
EXPENDITURE OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE. 
Herewith is presented a classified statement of the expenditures 
made in the Superintendent’s office from March 25, 1875, to Sep- 
tember 1, 1876, from the time of my induction into office to the 
close of the last scholastic year. The principal items, besides the 
" salary allowed ‘to the Superintendent, are ‘printing blanks, school 
registers, and annual report for 1875, postage and expressage. The 
postage account was mostly incurred in sending these reports and 
blanks to the parties entitled to them. All these items were in- 
curred during my administration of the office, excepting one bill 
for printing, etc., of about $600 previously ordered, and it is be- 
lieved, are as near the standard of true economy as the office can be 
operated, so as to carry out the purposes of its organization. Item- 
ized vouchers are filed in the office of the Comptroller.

CONCLUSION. 
Earnest acknowledgments, for uniform courtesy and. considera- 
tion, are hereby tendered to the various County Superintendents 
_ and other school officers with whom I have been in constant and 
daily correspondence. I am indebted to my intelligent assistant, : 
Mr. W. E. Armstrong, for ready, cheerful and able service in the 
discharge of duty. I also feel profoundly grateful to many able 
educators in the State for hearty and needed support-in counsel and 
at general Institutes. And I again renew my sincere thanks to 
your Excellency for strong, wise and unwearied support and coun- 
sel, at all times, when required by the public welfare or my own de- 
ficiencies.

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ REPORTS.

“to teachers, which accounts for the small enrollment. Past indebt- 
-edness was thereby liquidated. 
  
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
Joun R. Dran, Superintendent. 
Hight schools less than last year are reported in operation, two 
or three districts having used their money to build school houses. _ 
A County Board of Education recommended. A Normal Depart- 
ment organized in connection with Shelbyville High School. Teach- 
-ers’ Institute in successful operation. 
BENTON COUNTY.

Great delinquency on the part of district directors: in making- 
their reports. 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
W. H. Henry, Superintendent. 
Complaint is made of district directors delaying their reports... 
The small enrollment is accounted for by the indebtedness to teach- 
ers, and the consequent suspension of schools in some districts. 
Marked improvement, in the grade of teachers, which is attributed: 
to the influence of Teachers’ Institutes. Public school system. 
working better than heretofore, and fully sustained by public senti- 
ment.

ferent. Sentiment of the people reported favorable to the school 
_ system. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
J. A. Irwin, Superintendent.

CARTER COUNTY. - 
H. C. Boyp, Superintendent. 
* Only six schools taught—cause, indebtedness. Incoming year 
opens with more flattering prospects. Greater interest manifested 
than at any former period. 
  
COFFEE COUNTY. 
T. J. Wiison, Superintendent. 
Failure in several districts to make reports noted, caused by ex- 
piration of term of service of directors. Change of the school 
year recommended. Much improvement in the quality of schools 
reported, though the school term is very short. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
R. 8S. THompson, Superjntendent. 
Few schools in operation on account of previous liabilities. Pub- 
lic sentiment would be more favorable to public schools could they

Directors negligent about making reports. 
  CUMBERLAND, COUNTY. 
Tuomas C. Center, Superintendent. .

' Enrollment and attendance have increased with the population, 
and the finances, considering the stringency of the times, have sur-

STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 57 
passed expectations. No improvement in school houses or 
apparatus: A County Board of Education strongly recommended, 
without which Board any attempted advance will be defeated. The 
Superintendent desires to emphasize this recommendation. 
  
DECATUR COUNTY. 
J. M. Porterrievp, Superintendent. 
The county is thinly settled—few free school pupils, which is a 
drawback to the system. 
  
DeKALB COUNTY. 
J. T. Trapp, Superintendent. 
The public schools are flourishing, and reports generally good. 
  
DICKSON COUNTY. 
L. L. Leacu, Superintendent. 
The Free Schools in Dickson county have accomplished more 
than the best educators of the county anticipated. In 1873 the 
Revenue Collector failed, and after considerable delay judgment 
was taken against him and the sureties on his official bond, for over 
$2,500 for school purposes, which amount has not yet been realized. 
Still, as former reports show, the schools have been kept-upa portion of 
each year. Fora number of years, under the previous school laws, 
some of the rural districts had been entirely neglected, others par- 
tially so. Under the present system all have been reached. Three 
years ago the County Court contributed one mill on property to 
that assessed by the State, 50 cents additional on polls, and divided 
the tax on privileges equally between the County and Schools. 
‘That was as liberal as the most sanguine friends of education ex- 
pected. 
Two. years ago the Court declined to tax property any- 
thing for schools, but retained the poll and privilege clauses, and 
still retains them. Under the previous school systems numerous
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  58 . REPORT OF THE 
liabilities had been created. They are liquidated now. The pre- 
sent Trustee took the trouble, during his previous term, to give 
notice to all having just claims, no matter when created, and the 
last dollar has been paid. In one of the districts, although the in- 
structions of the State Superintendent were shown them, the Directors 
organized too many schools, and are something over two hundred 
dollars in debt for salaries to teachers. The other districts are all 
out of debt, or have the money on hand to pay as soon as the schools 
close. So that the year 1876-7 will enjoy financial facilities not 
previously enjoyed.” Formerly, the men owning magnificent estates 
ignored the education of their neighbors’ children—sent their own. 
children abroad to be educated, and even neglected, when they went 
to die, to provide for the future youth of the country. I will not 
do the memory of Montgomery Bell injustice—he did not entirely 
forget this County, to which he mainly owed his large fortune. 
‘When the County Court assessed one additional mill on property 
for schools, the largest property holder in the county—a gentléman 
who pays taxes on more than 15,000 acres of land in the county— 
openly declared he would rather. they had made it four mills than 
one. No one in my recollection has opposed the increase on taxes. 
purely for school purposes. Three years ago all the private schools. 
in the county were converted into public schovis, and they so re~ 
main. In this way, when there are funds to run the Public Schools, 
the profegsional teachers of the county teach them, and no instance. 
is remembered where there has been a conflict between the Public 
and Private Schools. Jt was apprehended three years-ago that the’ 
interest of two of the old Academies would conflict with the organ- 
ization of Public Schools in those localities, owing to the local pat- 
ronage. The Trustees of both Academies agreed with the Directors

The consolidated and graded schools have better buildings and 
furniture and more text-books ; but there isa marked improvement 
in all the new school-houses; even when constructed of hewn tim~ 
bers, light and ventilation are better provided for than formerly— 
a healthy improvement since my last report in that respect. Some 
advancement has been made towards uniformity of text-books, but 
not sufficient to hope for its early accomplishment. -We wish to_ 
revive the Institute meetings early next season. This locality does not 
‘need a compulsory system of education. We need money, without 
-depending on the County Court to supplement the State. Parents 
‘and children in common shared the regret that the schools could not 
be prolonged for the want of means. Many of the opponents of the -

discipline and more accurate methods of instruction, not only by 
cutting off superfluous and unnecessary teachers, but by subjecting

fully paid and a balance on hand of $16,000, with which to com- 
mence the school year of 1876-7. Public sentiment seems to favor 
the public school system, and these schools have almost monopolized 
the educational work of the county. Schools vary much in degrees 
of excellence. Some are almost contemptible in all the appoint- 
ments of well-regulated schools—while others are indeed excellent, 
largely attended—under teachers of rarely superior attainments, and . 
held in commodious and comfortable buildings, well provided with 
excellent furniture. Some amendments are deemed essential to the 
successful working of the law—principally the enlargement of the 
powers of the County Superintendent, and requiring him to devote 
his entire time to his work. An excellent and well-digested code 
of regulations for the schools of the county has been adopted and 
promulgated. .

A visitor, Rey. J. B. Pence, a thoroughly educated teacher, was.

detailed report on the history and condition of the schools. This. 
visitation and report awakened a new interest in the teachers, and: 
also in patrons, encouraging them to improve their school houses, 
grounds, etc. Uniformity in text books is nearly complete, beingy 
however, the work of several years. Supervision cannot be dis- 
pensed with. Without it there is no centre, no motive power, and 
the Jaw is a nullity. Eight Teachers’ Institutes have been held.

Dear Sir: In the case of the child of Finster, I see no way 
to escape the effect of the Act of 1855-6, c. 40, s. 1, which declares 
persons of color to include “all negroes, mulattoes, mestizoes, and 
their descendants having any African blood in their veins. Code, 
2745, a. 
The Act of 1873, c. 25, s. 30, prohibits white and colored per- 
‘sons being taught in the same schools. As the definition of colored 
persons is so sweeping, it seems that the least taint of it is sufficient. 
I would recommend that you ask the Legislature to declare the 
‘degree which should operate to exclude. It would seem odious that. 
the distinction could never be bred out. 
Yours, 
J. B. HEIskeLy, Aitorney General.

80 REPORT OF THE . 
STATE NORMAL COLLEGE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
NASHVILLE. 
The Chancellor of the University of Nashville and President of 
the State Normal College, Eben 8. Stearns, A. M., has furnished 
the following clear statement of the origin, opening and progress of 
the College: 
This institution, so called in order to recognize its connection with 
the University of Nashville, and to designate its object, to educate 
teachers for every grade of instruction, is the keystone of the grand 
arch of Public Education. It owes its existence to the enlightened 
efforts of prominent educators in this and neighboring States, and 
the demand of the people for better qualified teachers, expressed 
through the Legislature of Tennessee, by an act passed March 23, 
1875, and approved the same day. 
The Preamble of the Act sets forth that “an adequate supply of 
professionally educated teachers is a necessity to the maintenance of 
an efficient system of public schools,” and the Act proceeds to make 
such provisions as have culminated in this institution. The State, 
_ however, not having provided the funds necessary for a full devel- 
opment of its purposes, the University of Nashville, one of the 
oldest and best known Universities in thé State, made a generous 
offer to suspend its literary department, and devote its buildings, 
grounds and funds, with the exception of those appropriated to the 
Medical College, to it; which generous proposition the Trustees of 
the “ Peabody Education Fund,” through their distinguished agent, 
Dr. Sears, promptly supplemented by an offer of $6,000 per annum 
for two years. 
These noble offers having been accepted by the Siate Board of 
Education, and grounds, buildings and funds to the amount of 
$12,000 having been thus furnished, measures were taken to open 
the institution.
-P-A-G-E-82
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 81 
Owing to the greatness of the work, the many hindrances en- 
countered, and the necessity for moving cautiously where such great 
interests were concerned, the College was not organized until De- 
cember 1, 1875, when it was formally inaugurated with appropriate 
ceremonies. : 
The season had already far advanced; the project was wholly 
new to most of the people; opportunity to make them acquainted 
with its design and time of opening could not be afforded; many 
.persons who might gladly have availed themselves of its advantages 
were already variously employed for the year, and not a few of its 
most sanguine friends doubted whether its beginning would not be, 
as to numbers, even humbler than was that of the first Normal 
School established on this continent, which started with three female 
students, The result, however, far exceeded expectation, and no 
less than fifteen candidates presented themselves for examination, 
and before the first term of ten weeks had closed, forty-seven had 
been admitted. At the close of the school year, the aumber had 
increased to siaty. 
‘EXAMINATION FOR ADMISSION. 
These examinations, conducted chiefly in writing, were made 
upon grammar-school studies only, and revealed a surprisingly gen- 
eral deficiency of knowledge of the elementary studies, on which 
all good education depends. Probably some of the candidates 
would have passed a far better examination in some of the higher 
branches of study. A great and most serions defect in school 
study, public and private, was thus at once brought to the surface, 
and indicated clearly where the earliest efforts of the College must 
be employed. : 
Each candidate, on entering, signed the following declaration: 
“TA. B., of am years of age. My object in entering 
this institution is to qualify myself to teach in and conduct schools, 
and for this purpose I intend to remain at this institution y and 
after that to devote myself to teaching; and I hereby promise to 
attend regularly and faithfully upon the exercises required, and to 
conform cheerfully to the discipline and rules which may be pre- 
scribed.

with reference to a three years’ course, or nine terms. 
ATTENDANCE, ETC.

the unfortunate habits of our people in this respect, been somewhat 
irregular, though several have not lost an hour of time or omitted 
‘the least required duty. The most of the students have been ma-

rience. : : 
With but few exceptions they have seemed fairly to appreciate- 
the grand work their chosen profession undertakes, and the necessi- 
ty of being thoroughly prepared for it by special study and train- 
ing, and have accordingly devoted themselves with great earnest- . 
ness and considerable success to the requirements of the institution. 
VISITORS, 
The interest of the public has been manifested by frequent visits. 
from educators and those who wished to assure themselves of its- 
character and usefulness by personal observation. 
On the 28th of April, the President, on the invitation of Colonel. 
Trousdale, attended the “ Teachers’ Institute and County Superin- 
tendents’ Convention for Middle Tennessee,” held at Murfreesboro,. 
taking with him several of the teachers and more advanced students. 
for the purpose of explaining the design of the College and illus- 
trating its work as éarried on from day to day. They were received. 
and listened to with great apparent interest by the intelligent edu- 
cators who composed the Convention, and were most hospitably en- 
tertained by the citizens. 
CLOSING EXAMINATIONS. 
The year closed with a series of written examinations with refer- 
ence to the advancement of the students and their future standing. 
No class has been graduated the present year. 
On the whole the friends of the State Normal College and of” 
popular education have great occasion to congratulate themselves. 
upon the success of the Institution thus far, and for the highest 
confidence in its future usefulness to the State and the South -gen- 
erally. 
GIFTS OF BOOKS, ETC, 
A most important and valuable gift of text-books has been made. 
the College by the well-known publishing house of A. 8. Barnes & 
Co., of New York and Chicago, through the agency of the “Pea- 
body Education Fund,” worth at retail not Jess than $1,000. They. 
presented also a set of their valuable “Teacher’s Library.” A
-P-A-G-E-86
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 85 
‘large number of volumes, mostly professional, have been given by 
"Geo. B. Emerson, LL. D., long known as a distinguished educator. 
A splendid set of “Appleton’s New Cyclopedia,” 16 vols., elegantly 
bound in full Russia, has been presented by Hon. Geo. H. Kuhn, a 
‘distinguished merchant of Boston, Mass., and the Messrs. Merriam, 
-of Springfield, Mass., with characteristic liberality have presented 
‘a complete set of Webster’s Dictionaries. The Institution is also 
indebted to Col. Trousdale for a set of outline maps, etc., from his 
‘office; and Hon. J. B. Killebrew, State Commissioner of Agricul- 
‘ture, etc., has not only furnished several copies of the Report of 
the “Resources of Tennessee,” but has kindly given to the students 
free access to his valuable collection of mineral ores, etc., at the 
‘Capitol. The Institution is under special obligations to him for 
valuable instruction in the Geology of the State. 
Doring this first year of the State Normal College, no charge 
‘whatever has been made for tuition or incidental expenses, includ- 
‘ing the use of text-books, in case of any student. Tt will be thus 
-seen that this Institution has been organized and conducted up to 
the present time without costing the State, or any of the students, a 
mill for its support. It has been, however, necessary to practice 
‘the closest economy and to restrict the Institution in many respects, 
when a more liberal expenditure would have been wisely made, had 
‘it been possible. . 
This is the peoples College, designed to benefit every citizen 
‘however humble. It is sure to make itself felt for good in every 
enterprise, upon every farm and in every shop. Experience has 
fully shown, in other States, that such an Institution once known to 
sand appreciated by the people will never be relinquished, but will 
be earnestly and liberally supported. Let the Legislature, who ex- 
-press the will of the people, once see and comprehend this, and 
they will feel sure that no act of theirs will more certainly commend 
‘them to the good judgment of their constituents, and it will receive 
-all the support from the State it requires. 
ITS WANTS. 
The wants of the College are many and urgent. An expected 
increase in the uumber of students will require additions to the 
-corps of instructors, and teachers for such a position must of course 
tbe of the very highest class, and such as would command the largest

compensation anywhere, It needs means to employ lecturers ins 
special departments. It needs convenient and tasteful furniture.. 
It needs apparatus for illustration in the various branches of Nat- 
aral Science. It requires musical instraments—books for a profes- 
sional Library—collections for the illustration of the branches of 
Natural History, and means to lay out and embellish the spacious 
grounds placed at its disposal by the University of Nashville. 
To meet these and other wants, to put the College on a level with. 
similar institutions elsewhere and to keep it up to a proper degree. 
of efficiency, an annual appropriation of not less than $10,000- 
should be made by the State—a small sum in comparison with the- 
wealth of the great and proud State of Tennessee, and yet one more. 
certain than perhaps any other that could be made to be returned’ 
to every class of people. 
Eren 8S. Stearns, Chancellor, ete. 
The corps of teachers and scholars have, from the opening of the- 
school, been much encouraged by the interest and sympathy exhib- 
ited in their work on the part of the Superintendent of Public In- 
struction and the Governor of the State. 
As this is the first attempt to establish an institution which shall 
be to teachers what the law or the medical school is to lawyers and 
doctors, in this part of the world, for white people, its friends have- 
reason for great hope in its future usefulness—from the steps already 
made in a healthy progress. Aspiring youth of both sexes are, in. 
various portions of the State, making preparation to enter its classes. 
Pupils who have enjoyed its advantages for but a brief season, have- 
been taken from its halls by eligible offers in the school-room. 
The action of the Peabody trustees at their last annual meeting, 
held in Virginia, is full of encouragement. The late Judge S. 
Watson, a member of the Board, and writing at the time, says: 
“Our trustees, in their discussions upon our school, show a decided 
and almost unanimous disposition to make our Normal School the 
Normal School of the South-west.” 
. In conclusion, allow me to say that a grand opportunity now pre-. ” 
sents itself to the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee. 
The history of popular education nowhere exhibits so liberal and 
munificent a contribution towards the enlightenment-of the masses. 
by an old and well established university as that which has been 
made by the Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville..
-P-A-G-E-88
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 87 
Their action has been seconded by that of the Trustees of the Pea- 
body Education Fund, a body composed of men known throughout 
America for business cupacity, integrity and far-sightedness, and who 
disburse the income of two millions of dollars. Both these Boards 
design to’ erect, under the authority and management of the State 
of Tennessee, a grand Institution at the capital of that State, which 
shall be felt and blessed by thousands upon thousands in that and 
the adjoining States for all coming time. One sole and perfectly 
reasonable condition is annexed by both these Boaads, namely, that 
the great State of Tennessee shall at least exhibit an equal interest 
in its maintenance and usefulness. 
All of which is respectfully submitted by 
J. Berrien Linpstey, 
Seoretary of the State Board of Education.

NASHVILLE. 
s. Y. CALDWELL, Superintendent. 
Nashville, November 1, 1876. 
It affords me great pleasure to be able to state that the work ac- 
complished in our city schools during the year closing August 31st, 
has been entirely as satisfactory as that in any one of the twenty 
years of their previous existence. In fact, the evidences of present 
prosperity and future promise warrant me in assuring a degree of 
progress hitherto unknown. These results have been attained in 
no very favorable circumstances. We have for the past two ses- 
sions labored at great disadvantage, in consequence of the difficulty 
of obtaining funds to pay teachers. This deficiency was caused by 
the legislation of the last General Assembly postponing the collec- 
tion of taxes. 
As the readiest means of furnishing you, at short notice, a com- 
prehensive statement of our condition, the following extracts from

STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 91 
‘The scholastic population has increased 263, being 8,851 for the 
year before; but there has heen a corresponding increment in total 
enrollment, making the percentage of those who have entered the- 
schools as great as formerly. This, in connection with the fact that 
the past high standard in regularity and punctuality has been sus- 
tained, proves that the school advantages are being enjoyed by those- 
for whom they were intended, to as great an extent as -héretofore. 
A fall appreciation of the schools would greatly lessen the dis- 
crepancy between average attendance and total enrollment, and 
nothing should be neglected that tends to accomplish so desirable a 
‘result. We would not complain, however, on this score, for the: 
progress is perhaps as rapid as could be expected, being over one- 
per cent. per annum for the last four years. At this rate of in- 
erease we may reasonably hope that our city will eventually equal: 
the most favored localities, in the extent to which public education. 
reaches the masses of the population. 
There is greater margin for improvement in this respect in the- 
colored than in the white schools, the per cent. in the latter being 
63, ‘against 76 in the former. From their less favorable surround- 
ings for school attendance, they will probably not be able to reach 
the same standard; however, it would hardly be safe to assert this. 
positively, since, as will appear in the tables in the appendix, they 
stand highest in per cent, of attendance on number belonging. 
The annual total cost of the schools was $66,615.65, which is 
about the same that it has usually been, The total expenditure,. 
however, was $80,988.34, of which $14,372.69 was a past-due in- 
debtedness from the previous year. To meet these amounts the 
receipts from State, county and city taxes were $61,871.49, leaving 
a deficit of $18,226.85. This has been constantly accumulating for 
the past six years, and, now that it amounts to almost one-third of” 
the yearly estimate for funds for the schools, is a serious incubus 
upon them. It is true, that at the close of each year temporary re- 
lief has generally been secured by negotiating a loan in bank, or by 
an advance of funds from the ordinary revenue in the hands of the 
City Treasurer, as was the case this session; but this only transfers 
the trouble, and in the end increases it; for the amount thus antici- 
pated is always liquidated Yrom the first receipts from the estimate 
for the following scholastic year, and thus, by a system of robbing 
Peter to pay Paul, the moneys which should be in hand to meet the
-P-A-G-E-93
920 REPORT OF THE 
salaries for the first months of the current year are absorbed, and 
teachers and other creditors must wait for the collections to come in 
from the succeeding months, and thus the session closes with an 
increased deficit. 
You will observe that the total cost per pupil, as compared with 
that for last, year, has diminished, while the cost for tuition alone 
has slightly increased. This shows that there has been a general 
reduction of expenses, but a loss in teachers’ labor, on account of 
-classes falling below the average number on roll. This is attributa- 
-ble in part to the irregularity in attendance mentioned herein be- 
fore, and in part to the unequal distribution of pupils to some of 
the buildings. The latter applies especially to the Hynes building, 
as will appear from the disproportionate cost per pupil in it, as 
shown in the table of detailed statistics in the appendix. 
A confirmation of the correctness of this explanation is found in 
the fact that the average salary paid to the teacher has diminished 
from $710 to $675. The former rate was not higher than that paid 
‘in other cities sustaining good schools, but the ten per cent. reduc- 
‘tion which you have decided upon will make it next year $600." It 
‘is possible that you may secure the services of an efficient corps at 
this rate, but it is perhaps the most dangerous direction in which to 
‘economize. We should never forget that, after all has been said 
and done, it is the TEACHER that makes the school. A hundred 
‘children in charge of a really educated, cultured, self-reliant, sue- 
-cessful instructor will be benefitted far more than would one-fourth 
‘the number under a superficial, blundering cheap teacher. 
Under the impulse of a temporary fit of economics, very often, 
‘plans for retrenchment have been adopted that were found to be in 
the end suicidally wasteful, if not irreparably ruinous. Public 
schools, far less than private, can afford to employ indifferent teach- 
ers, for the reason that they are accessible to all classes. Better 
abolish than render them inefficient. 
The average per cent. of scholarship was 69, which is an advance 
-of one per cent. It is based upon the results of written examina- 
tions alone. Of these, in addition to the monthly and the final ex- 
-amination, a semi-annual one was held in the month of February, 
for the purpose of preparing material for exhibition at the Centen- 
nial Exposition at Philadelphia. It was conducted in conformity 
with directions issued from the United States Bureau of Education.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. 93: 
A set of questions embracing the subjects of the previous five 
months’ study, was submitted to the classes, throughout the schools, 
on the same day. Twelve octavo volumes, averaging 500 pages. 
each, of manuscript work by the pupils, and ten portfolios of free- 
hand and map drawings, were prepared, which, in the opinion of ° 
competent, disinterested critics, were.as creditable as the perform- 
ances of graded schools in other cities. The work was gotten up. 
as inexpensively as possible, no attempt being made at display; in 
fact, except the cost of plainly binding the volumes, there was no 
expense, the children themselves doing all the work of ruling paper, 
copying questions, etc. We preferred that they should do so, for 
the reason that it thus became a more truthful, if a less showy, ex- 
hibit of their handiwork. 
Some volumes of manuscript work from the Memphis, Shelby-" 
ville and Powell’s Station schools, were also sent forward for ex- 
hibition, constituting, with ours, the only educational display from 
this State. As there was no appropriation whatever for this pur- 
pose, and the necessary funds had to be raised by individual effort, 
we of course labored under great disadvantages. _ 
But for the voluntary assistance rendered by Mr. Chas. T. Grier 
and his intelligent and accomplished lady—formerly of Nashyille,. 
but now residents of Philadelphia—-we would not have been able 
to present the articles, They took charge of the space allowed us, 
arranged the things in proper place, and have supervised them most 
carefully, presenting them in the most acceptable manner possible 
in the circumstances. These, we regret to say, were by no means 
favorable, since: the space allotted us by the directory was an obscure. 
corner in a section assigned to the American Missionary Society.

98 REPORT OF THE 
The past year has been a prosperous one for our schools, except 
financially. They have felt the stringency of the times, and many 
needed improvements have been deferred until a favorable turn in 
the business tide shall cause money to flow more freely and in wider 
channels. / 
The monthly enrollment has increased 83 over any previous year, 
and the average belonging 105. This isa long step in the right 
direction, for without regular attendance no scholar can pursue a 
regular course of study satisfactorily to himself, his teacher or his 
friends. 
There are yet many errors to, correct and abuses to reform in re- 
gard to absence and irregularities in our schools, which deserve the 
most careful consideration if we would perfect our séhool system 
and render it the most efficient. The more thoroughly parents aud 
pupils realize that rules against unnecessary absence are for their 
benefit and the best good of the whole, instead of an arbitrary show 
of authority on the part of teachers and school officers, the more 
readily will they conform to a strict regimen. . ° 
Punctuality and promptness in every department of life are 
essential qualities to the highest success, and school should not be 
an exception, nay, rather should they be inculcated by precept and 
example by the teacher and parent, and when necessary, stringent 
rules ought to be made and enforced. 
Our school system is now four years old, and the improvement of 
pupils in habits of study, morals and manners, scholarly bearing, 
and, in short,-all those qualities that tend to make excellent scholars 
and noble men and women for the future of our city and State, has 
been very marked and gratifying. Much of our hard work has 
been beneath the surface, laying broad and deep the foundation for 
a solid and beautiful superstructure, that shall be commensurate 
with the needs of our growing city. , The surface has been reached, 
and the work already stands out with prominence, the pride of our 
people, commanding their sympathies and hearty co-operation to. 
such an extent that the per cent. of enrollment on the scholastic 
population is greater than in most cities of the South and West.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. . 99 
KNOXVILLE. 
H. T. Morron, Superintendent. 
From the annual report, ending June 10, 1876, of the Superin- 
 tendent, Rev. H. T. Morton, the following facts are gathered: 
There has been a decided improvement in public sentiment to- 
ward the city schools. Oral instruction has been introduced into 
the three years of the primary grade, which has been a saving to 
* the patrons of $2,000 to $2,500. With regard to comparative. cost 
of private and public schools, Mr. Ray], President of the Board of 
Edugation, remarks: : 
In our best private schools the cost of tuition is from $3.00 to 
$4.00 per month for each pupil, while in the city schools i gosts the 
taxpayers only $11.80 for ten months’ tuition, for bic ‘hchiplan, be- 
longing, and the character of the instructioa\imparted is to a whit 
inferior to that given in any private school’of similar grade ia‘the 
city. Apa verification of this assertion, we' tef ye the 1,500 chil- 
dren taught, and also to the parents who-have én, their childreh 
with a good degree of regularity and panctuality ; and for'thebe two 
reasons: oa o 
1. The teachers are as well qualified and Aave better opporfini- 
ties for improvement in governing and instrycting. yor 
2. The schools are more thoroughly graded than any small pri- 
vate school can be. : 
As stated above, 1,500 children have attended the schools for a 
longer or shorter period. For the sake of comparison, take a num- 
ber less than the enrollment and yet greater than the average at- 
tendance, say 1,100, and estimate the price at $3.00 per month, and 
you have for the eleven hundred children educated in our schools, 
the handsome sum of $33,000, instead of a little less than $138,000 
as reposted by the Treasurer. Then as to the cost of private and 
public schools, it would seem that he that runs might read.

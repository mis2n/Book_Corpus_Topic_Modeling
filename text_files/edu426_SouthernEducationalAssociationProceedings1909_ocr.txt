1. The Southern Educational Association expresses its sense of grati- 
fication at the success of the twentieth session of this body held in 
Charlotte, N. C., December 28-30, 1909. The attendance has included 
large delegations of the most representative quality from the educa- 
tional leadership of sixteen Southern States. 
2. The papers and discussions have been of the highest order, at 
once full of inspiration and of sharp practical value in all the fields 
of educational endeavor. 
8. Especial commendation seems due to the excellent exhibits from 
many of the leading school systems of the South. 
4, The Association marks with pleasure the note of optimism from 
every section of the field of Southern education, and pledges itself to 
hearty codperation in the furtherance of all of the educational interests 
of this great section. 
5. The Association expresses its cordial appreciation of the many 
courtesies and hospitalities of the citizens of Charlotte, a community 
which is itself, it seems to us, a fine complete embodiment of the spirit 
of educational progress, civic pride and industrial and vocational en- 
terprises, the great principles for social uplift to which this Association 
stands pledged. 
6. Especially does the Association express its thanks to the author- 
ities in charge for the use of the Presbyterian College and Graded 
School building; to the Charlotte Observer, and the Charlotte Chronicle, 
and the Charlotte News for their full and appreciative reports of the 
proceedings of the different Associations; to the Committee on Recep- 
tion, the Federation of Women’s Clubs and the Greater Charlotte Club

for their charming hospitality, which has contributed greatly to the

tended to all of the executive officers of the Association.

The meeting was called to order by President Van Sickle, 
after which Supt. J. Y. Joyner, President of the National Edu- 
cational Association, extended a very cordial invitation to the 
Southern Educational Association to attend the meeting in 
Boston in July. Prof. Frank McMurry, of Columbia Univer- 
sity, read a paper on “What is Good Teaching,” after which 
Mrs. Andrews, of Boston, gave a talk on the “Significance of 
the Peace Movement Among the Public School Children.” 
President Thach then offered the following resolution, which 
was unanimously passed: 
The Southern Educational Association in meeting assembled at Char- 
lotte, N. C., hereby expresses its cordial sympathy with the aims and 
purposes of the American School Peace League, and pledges its earnest 
and untiring codperation in the furtherance of its high purpose of 
promoting the interests of justice and brotherhood among the nations 
of men. 
Ex-President Eliot, of Harvard University, then made an ad- 
dress, taking for his subject, “Best Directions for Immediate 
Educational Effort.” After a resolution was offered and 
adopted thanking the President and Secretary for working up 
such a large meeting, the Association was ordered adjourned 
by President Van Sickle.

AN EXPLANATION. 
The present Secretary of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion will not attempt to enumerate the difficulties encountered 
in getting together the papers and other copy for this volume. 
He was elected Secretary by the Board of Directors after the 
adjournment of the meeting of the Association held in Chatta- 
nooga, December, 1910. The proceedings for 1909 had not been 
printed, and only a few of the papers read at that meeting, as 
well as the 1910 meeting, were turned over to him. 
The following circular issued by President Cassidy from Lex- 
ington, Ky., on March 18, 1911, explains itself: 
To Wom Ir May Concern : 
Owing to the delinquency of the former Secretary of the Southern 
Educational Association, the proceedings of the Charlotte, N. C., meet- 
ing have not yet been published. It is the sincere desire of the present 
officers of the Association to issue, at the earliest possible time, both 
the Charlotte and the Chattanooga proceedings in two separate volumes. 
Because of an unwise and perhaps unwarranted expenditure of the 
Association’s funds by the former Secretary, the amount that can be 
expended on these publications is necessarily limited, and in order 
to meet the unpleasant—yes, embarrassing—exigency that has been 
forced upon the Association, it is found necessary to publish the papers 
read at Charlotte and Chattanooga in a greatly abridged form. This 
is much to be regretted, for, having read these papers, I am impressed 
with both their thought and style of presentation and am exceedingly 
sorry that each one cannot appear as originally written. 
It was at first contemplated, and was so ordered by the Board of 
Directors, that I should edit and condense all of the papers read on 
the two occasions referred to. The papers were sent to me for this 
purpose, but on beginning the work I was soon convinced that it was 
a task which no one could perform with satisfaction, either to himself 
or to the authors. It would be taking too much liberty with the fine 
thoughts of others. And upon mature reflection, I have concluded 
that in justice to the authors these excellent papers should be returned 
to them, and that they should be requested to rewrite them as briefly 
as possible. 
I feel sure of the cheerful codperation of each writer in this em- 
barassing situation and earnestly request that he rewrite his paper, 
incorporating nothing that is not absolutely essential to preserve the 
thought and unity of the production. In other words, make it as brief 
as possible. 
If each contributor will do this at once, and return the condensed 
production to Mr. Wm. F. Feagin, Secretary of the Southern Educational  
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Association, Montgomery, Ala., at the earliest possible moment, the pro- 
ceedings will be printed as soon thereafter as possible and promptly 
sent to the members of the Association. Please bear in mind, in re- 
writing your paper, to preserve only essentials, to have the rewritten 
paper typewritten, and to return immediately to the Secretary at Mont- 
gomery, as stated in the previous paragraph. 
All who have not returned their papers by April 3, 1911, will be 
considered as not desirous of having them printed, since the proceedings 
must be in the hands of the printers not later than April 10, 1911. I 
beg to assure you that you will greatly assist us by complying promptly, 
if not cheerfully, with this request, and that no such contingency will 
arise after the next meeting. 
Assuring you of my gratitude and asking your hearty codperation for 
the future success of the Association, I am, 
With great respect,

President Southern Educational Association.

WELCOME ADDRESS. 
SUPT. J. Y. JOYNER. 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
In the name of ten thousand teachers, seven hundred thou- 
sand school children, more than two million people, I extend 
to you a Tar Heel welcome to the Old North State, “Where the 
weak grow strong and the strong grow great.” 
The whole State stands with outstretched hands and bids 
you welcome. My poor words of welcome are but the feeblest | 
echo of the unworded welcome that thrills a thousand thousand 
hospitable hearts today at the news of your coming within our 
gates. 
We welcome you for what you are, a goodly company of men 
and women from all our sister Southern States, called to the 
high calling of developing the unknown possibilities of child- 
hood into the infinite possibilities of manhood and womanhood, 
an aristocracy of mind, morality and unselfish service to whom 
more than to those of any other calling has been entrusted the | 
fashioning of the forces for protecting our homes, perpetuating | 
our prosperity and preserving our civilization. 
We welcome you for what you bring to us—instruction and | 
inspiration, higher ideals and nobler aims, a finer enthusiasm 
and a sublimer faith. We shall receive more than we can give, 
but we rejoice that it is truly more blessed to give than to re- 
ceive, then yours will be by refiex action the greater blessing 
still. 
Such a body of men and women, on such a mission bent, 
ought to feel at home in a State that was among the first of all 
the Southern States to establish and maintain a public school 
system before the war; to reconstruct, enlarge and improve it 
after the war; that was, so far as I know, the only Southern 
State that kept open its public schools and preserved untouched 
its permanent school fund of two million dollars throughout 
the war. 
Could all the people of the State have been consulted they 
would, I think, have chosen for the royal entertainment of 
their honored guests this, their “Queen City,” that stands upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the sacred soil where American patriots first hurled defiance 
into the teeth of British tyrants. 
Our welcome is all the warmer because you have come to see 
us in the midst of a happy Christmas-tide, when “Peace on 
Earth, Good Will Towards Men,” is written above the portals 
of every home and every heart in our old-fashioned State that 
has not yet grown so new-fashioned, thank God, as to neglect 
hospitality, forget spirituality, sneer at honest sentiment, and 
teach its children that nothing must be believed that cannot 
be proven; that Santa Claus and the spirit that he stands for 
is a myth, and the Babe of Bethlehem no longer divine. 
We are glad that you have come; we shall be sorry when you 
must leave. We wish you while you stay profit, goodfellowship 
and gladness. 
Ours is yours while you remain. If any old fellow grows 
tired of the city, come into the country and we will warm his 
heart with a country welcome—one of North Carolina’s own. 
“A hospitable wide hearthstone, 
A cheering pipe of cob or briar, 
And a red, rousing, light’ood fire.” 
ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
SUPT. F. P. GRAHAM, CHARLOTTE, N. C. 
Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen of the South- 
ern Educational Association: 
I am here today to welcome you to a city that is 580 miles 
long and 180 miles wide. My welcome, therefore, is exactly in 
that proportion, 580 miles long and 180 miles wide. I feel this 
morning (not having any subject assigned to me, that being 
impossible), like Senator Mooney did when he arose to speak 
at the Southern Manufacturers’ Club in this city. “Boys,” he 
said, “you have not given me any subject, so I think I will just 
take a crack at creation and quit at that.” This is the first 
time in all my life that I have had an opportunity to address 
the whole Southern Confederacy at one time, with the border 
States thrown in. I know of nothing more appropriate to say 
to you in a welcoming address than to say that North Carolina  
-P-A-G-E-23
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 23 
feels like a full sister to many of your States, and at least a 
half sister to all the rest. 
When I look over this list of States represented here, North 
Carolina has a right to claim as a first State not as a sister 
only, but as a daughter, Tennessee. Tennessee came into this 
Union at the same time that the great State of Kentucky came 
in. I believe as I go along I will try and show the bond. Ten- 
nessee claims that she has had three Presidents of the United 
States—Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew John- 
son. North Carolina claims to have furnished the birthplace 
of all three of these. Polk was born in North Carolina only 
seven, or perhaps nine, miles from the spot where I am now 
standing. Jackson was born in North Carolina, not very far 
from the place where we are now assembled, and Johnson was 
born in the city of Raleigh. 
As we do not seem to be in a great hurry this morning I 
would like to tell you the first time I ever saw a President of 
the United States. It was that great man Johnson, when he 
came to visit at the University of North Carolina. One hun- 
dred and twenty-five men greeted him at the Governor’s Man- 
sion. When called upon for a speech, it was made in language 
something like this: “Young gentlemen, I cannot quote to you 
of any great Emperors of Roman history, for I have never 
studied Latin, neither can I cite to you any great heroes of 
Grecian history, for I have never studied Greek, but if you will 
pardon me I will point you to myself. Forty years ago, young 
gentlemen, almost to a day, I passed along that pathway there, 
barefooted, and with only thirty-five cents in my pockets, which 
had been given me by a friend. Today I stand here a President 
of the United States of America, a position second to none on 
the face of the globe.” 
I have not called your attention to the fact that Maryland, 
Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia were members of the 
original family of our State. Tennessee and Kentucky are the 
oldest ones of the original thirteen. Louisiana comes next, com- 
ing at the same time as the great State of Indiana. We have 
under Johnson the great State of Arkansas, that joined our 
Confederacy; after that we have the great States of Missis- 
sippi, Missouri and Alabama, under the great President 
Monroe.
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Under Polk we received the great State of Texas; then we 
received the State of West Virginia, and under Mr. Roosevelt 
the great State of Oklahoma. I believe now that this composes 
this great audience, sixteen States, besides the District of Co- 
lumbia. 
Now, fellow-citizens, North Carolina feels like the mother of 
all these States. I could give you some reasons why she feels 
that way. There is hardly one of these States that North Caro- 
lina is not related to. Take the great State of Kentucky. 
Whom does Kentucky claim as her father? Who, indeed, but 
the great Daniel Boone, who was born within forty miles of 
this place, in Yadkin County. Next after the great State of 
Kentucky we see the great State of Louisiana. Fellow-citizens, 
North Carolina and Louisiana have something in common. 
The ex-President of the University of Tulane was a native of 
this State, Dr. E. A. Alderman. Former Governor Johnston, 
of Alabama, was a native of this very town in which this Asso- 
ciation is here assembled, and former President Winson of 
the University of Texas. There is not one of these States but 
what is associated by holy ties with this State. 
I do not know anything to make you feel more welcome in 
the State of North Carolina than to tell you that this whole 
State is grateful to the South for supporting in its early in- 
fancy the great University of North Carolina. The children 
of North Carolina and of the public schools of North Carolina 
are indebted to all these Southern States for their patronage. 
I heard an astute educator once say that if it were brought to 
a necessity of abolishing the University or the public school 
system, with bowed head he would say, “Abolish the public 
school system.” And why? Because of you keep a University 
the public school system will naturally and inevitably result 
from that, but if you destroy the university both university and 
schools would ultimately disappear. This has been the experi- 
ence in this State, working simultaneously with the develop- 
ment of the State University to a point of higher efficiency, 
where it has now nearly 900 pupils, there has come a corre- 
sponding extent and improvement in the elementary schools. 
I would like to speak to you longer, fellow-citizens, but I do 
not feel that a longer speech is necessary, particularly on this 
occasion, but I will put upon the programme, of all good things
-P-A-G-E-25

there are three. We have given you three welcoming ad- 
dresses and hope that now you all feel welcome. If you will 
excuse me I again would like to leave with you as a remem- 
bered sentence, that alluded to by Superintendent Joyner, a 
sentiment of one of the brightest ladies in all the North. She 
said: 
“Here’s to the Land of the Long Leaf Pine, 
The Summer Land, where the sun doth shine; 
Where the weak grow strong, and the strong grow great, 
Here’s to ‘Down Home,’ the Old North State!” 
RESPONSE TO WELCOME ADDRESS. 
SUPT. R. J. TIGHE, ASHEVILLE, N. C. 
Mr, President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Association: 
I am very sorry that more of the Southern Educational Asso- 
ciation are not present to hear these welcoming words of ad- 
dress from our Honorable State Superintendent, Mr. J. G. Joy- 
ner, the Mayor of the city, and Mr. Graham. 
Gentlemen and representatives of the South in this Associa- 
tion are glad to be here, and those of Greater North Carolina 
are also glad to be at home here in the Old North State. It is 
peculiarly fitting that the Southern Educational Association 
should come to North Carolina occasionally. 
Some twenty years ago we people of this State and educators 
of this State, with others in the South, thought it quite neces- 
sary that the field of the South should have an Association, 
and so twenty years ago in this State—I believe at Morehead 
City—this Association was organized, at least a branch of it, 
and the same year at Montgomery another branch was born. 
Thus it might be said that the Association began life as twins. 
Later, at Chattanooga, the two were made into one Associa- 
tion, and since then it has been doing business in one State or 
another throughout the United States. 
This Association has a peculiar work of its own. Every sec- 
tion, of course, has its own peculiar problems. The South is 
no exception. We have ours. We feel that we have done some 
good work and that considerable progress has been effected  
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
as a result of organized effort. I want to speak in behalf of 
the Association that they have given us the value of a good 
programme and they have tried to make it the best. 
I hope that the people of Charlotte will come out here and 
hear what these people have to say and also come to the 
Department sessions. Mr. Mayor, we beg to accept your kind 
invitation to your city, and hope to be able to return it to you 
in as good condition as when we received it. And now, on 
behalf of the Southern Confederacy of Education, we accept 
with thanks the kindly greetings of the State North Carolina. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 
J. H. VAN SICKLE. 
Irv is my pleasant duty and privilege to introduce the dis- 
tinguished speakers who will address this Association upon 
topics of vital importance to education in general, but particu- 
larly to education in the Southern States. 
What are the problems before the Southern Educational As. 
sociation? In part they are the same as those under discus- 
sion in all sections of the country—economy of time in educa- 
tion, provision for exceptional children in the public schools, 
courses of study, vocational training, school attendance, moral 
education, rural schools, agricultural education, the supply, 
compensation, and training of teachers, etc. In part they 
grow out of special conditions which obtain more or less gen- 
erally throughout the sixteen States in the Association. 
One of these conditions has to do with the financial support 
of schools. Fifty years ago the per capita wealth in the South 
was greater than in the North, and thirty per cent of the 
entire wealth of the country was in the South. The average 
per capita wealth of the whole country, at the preesnt time, is 
more than twice that of the Southern States; and the amount 
raised for each child of school age in the United States in 
1906 was between three and four times that raised in the 
South. Consequently the inadequacy and uncertainty of school 
revenues has been one of our pressing problems. The last five
-P-A-G-E-27
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 27 
years have been years of wonderful progress toward securing 
more adequate local revenue and better and more reliable 
State and county support for schools. Meanwhile wealth is 
increasing both actually and relatively in the South, so that 
in a few more decades this financial aspect of school main- 
tenance will disappear as a special problem, applicable as such 
only to a particular section of the country. But until com- 
munities become accustomed to higher local taxation for the 
maintenance of their schools, the financial side will continue 
to be a question of special importance. 
The large rural population of the South, as compared with 
the urban, makes the rural school problem one of special im- 
portance and one surrounded with peculiar difficulties. 
The education of two races side by side, but absolutely sepa- 
rate, immensely complicates our problems. 
Vocational training must be planned to correlate with the 
prevailing industries of a locality. This is, therefore, a special 
problem. Compulsory attendance, child labor, and the hygenic 
conditions under which children live and work, will require 
special attention form us, until our record in these particulars 
shows distinct advance over the present status. 
These are problems adapted to develop educational talent 
of a higher order. They afford scope for statesmanlike quali- 
tties. May it not be that through our necessities, working as 
we have to do with resources less ample than other sections, 
we shall first solve some of the problems now agitating the 
public mind—for example, that of economy of time in educa- 
tion; that of harmonizing vocational and cultural aims; that 
of differentiation of courses to provide for special aptitudes 
among our students, so that talent along any line may be dis- 
covered and developed with the least waste of time and energy. 
Not all of our special problems will be solved by us nor in our 
time. How can we shape our present plans so as to develop 
all of the initiative and originality that the young in our 
schools are capable of, so that they will be prepared to lead 
in the unfinished work? How avoid the dead level and 
monotony which creates followers when we need to develop 
feaders? The very limitation of our resources impresses upon 
us the absolute necessity of simplifying our educational plans 
wherever outworn traditions hold sway. * * *

Improvements is to be looked for in better discrimination 
between the essential and non-essential in formulating the 
course of study; in earlier and surer discovery of exceptional 
children, and in provision for their proper segregation, classi- 
fication, and advancement along the lines for which they are 
best fitted; in differentiating courses for children according to 
aptitude and aims somewhat earlier than is now customary. 
This implies better prepared teachers, better paid teachers, 
closer and more expert supervision, and a higher conception 
of the importance for the purposes of the State and of the in- 
dividual of the early, formative years. 
Nowhere else in America is such earnest and telling work 
being done to accomplish these purposes as in the sixteen 
States of our Association. Some of these States have made 
phenomenal progress in these important directions, and we 
may confidently expect this meeting to give additional impulse 
toward further progress.

A COURSE OF STUDY FOR COUNTRY HIGH SCHOOLS. 
SUPT. 'T. H. HARRIS, BATON ROUGE, LA. 
SummManrizinG, I advocate (1) elementary instruction of a 
nature to lay firm foundations in English and mathematics 
and in habits of self-reliance, plus the utilization of as much 
material uniting the schools with the life about it as possible; 
(2) high school courses broad enough to serve the few who 
wish to prepare for college and professional life, and also the 
many who pass from the high school to the serious work of 
life; (3) that the high schools may leave the masses more 
efficient wherever they touch them, there should be added to 
the courses of study the type of industrial training adapted 
to the needs of the community which the school is serving; 
(4) domestic science, wood work and iron work, commerce, 
agriculture, and other industries within. the scope of high 
school instruction can be taught only by teachers specially 
trained for this character of work; (5) the masses will be 
educated along practical lines through the agency of the peo-  
-P-A-G-E-29

ple’s college—the public high school—and in order to place 
the high school within reach of all the people and to broaden 
its work to meet the needs of all the people, more money must 
be invested in this phase of education than it has ever yet 
occurred to us to put into it, a large part of which cost must 
be lifted from the shoulders of local communities and borne by 
the general State government; (6) the industrial work which 
the country high school will undertake will necessarily be 
domestic science for the girls and agriculture for the boys. 
The successful operation of such departments in the country 
schools will give to the country districts of our land women 
who know how to create comfortable, beautiful homes, and 
men who love the soil and know how to make it fruitful— 
men who will carry to their work on the farm the same type 
of intelligence, industry, and skill that are to be found in other 
lines of successful labor. All labor will be skilled labor; all 
work will be honorable if it has brains to direct it, and the 
school will have become a positive agency in equipping people 
with strength for their daily duties. 
A TEACHERS’ ADVISORY COUNCIL. 
SUPT. ARTHUR LEFEVER, DALLAS, TEXAS. 
{Nortr.—From monthly report of the public schools of Dallas, Texas, 
made by Supt. Arthur Lefevre, April, 1909. Action was immediately 
taken by the Board of Education in accordance with the recommenda- 
tion.] 
Tue substitution of autocratic regulation for genuine organi- 
zation in the professional life and work of teachers is the worst 
defect in the public school systems of the United States. In 
the large public school systems of this country each teacher, 
speaking generally, feels concerned for only one very small 
segment of the work of the schools. Not infrequently the lack 
of organized céoperation between different parts of the system 
engenders suspicious, repellant, or antagonistic attitudes in 
those who ought to be co-workers. The consequences of this 
universal defect are not confined to poor results in studies, but 
appear in the moral atmosphere of the school.
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
There is not, within my knowledge, a public school system 
in the United States in which formal arrangement has been 
made for requiring and for considering the counsel of those 
who do the actual teaching, in determining plans for directing 
and controlling the work they perform. It would, therefore, 
be expedient to institute formally provisions for securing the 
advice of teachers, with the main purpose of engendering a 
free interest in the entire scope of their joint professional work 
and a sense of individual responsibility for intelligent 
initivative. 
Personal invitation by the Superintendent is not enough. 
No matter how sincere he may be in his personal efforts to stir 
up those charged with such a responsibility as the intellectual 
and moral development of children and adolescent youths, 
from thoughtless subjection to or dependence upon autocratic 
judgment and initiative, it is practically impossible to elicit 
the needed response in the individuals of a large body of 
teachers. It is true, that a genuine organizer of workers for 
any sort of spiritual results must have the power of communi- 
cating his own feeling for the dignity of individuality, and 
that sense of personal responsibility which is essential to true 
success in such work, but so inveterate is the conception of 
“the rank and file’ in public school teachers, so new and un- 
thought of is the idea of transforming passive ranks and files 
of toilers into truly organized individuals aroused for intelli- 
gent initiative and to personal responsibility for wise counsels, 
self-criticism, and self-control, that formal recognition by the 
supreme authority of the existence of such duties and oppor- 
tunities is needed. 
The Superintendent’s invitation needs to be reinforced by 
suitable requirements by the Executive Board. Final decisions 
must remain with the Board and with the Superintendent, but 
every teacher should be led to understand that there is a regu- 
lar way by which his judgment upon any existing or proposed 
arrangement affecting the work of the schools will be duly 
considered, and that counsel in such regards is not only wel- 
come, but the expression of deliberate opinions is expected and 
imposed as a duty. Such conditions ought to be established 
in a formal and institutional manner. 
I propose that a Teachers’ Advisory Council be instituted,
-P-A-G-E-31
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 31 
the Council to be constituted of teachers in the schools for 
white children as follows: One representative elected by the 
teachers of each “grade” of the elementary schools; one repre- 
sentative elected by the faculty of each high school; two prin- 
cipals of elementary schools elected by the principals. This 
council should meet as occasions arise to hear all teachers who 
may desire to present their views, and the council should be 
required to file with the Secretary of the Board of Education 
on or before the first day of June each year such report as it 
may choose on matters concerning the elementary schools as a 
whole, addressed to the Superintendent, but to remain intact 
in the records of the Board and to be considered by the Board 
in connection with the reports and recommendations of the 
Superintendent. 
I recommend the adoption of a rule requiring that the Teach- 
ers’ Advisory Council be formed each year before the end of 
' the third month in the manner and for the purposes described. 
It is a vital point in my proposal that the advice from the 
teachers be filed intact in the records of the Board. Even in 
higher educational institutions, where faculty reports are al- 
ways made, they frequently never reach the Executive Board, 
or reach the supreme authority so revised by the President 
as to misrepresent by distortion or by suppression their origi- 
nal purport. 
I beg to assure you, that if you institute the procedure I 
propose, the Dallas Board of Education will set a notable ex- 
ample, and one that may in due time spread abroad incal- 
culable benefits. If the Executive Board of any system of 
public schools in this country has ever taken such action, I do 
not know it. Of course, it is even notorious that the “Chicago 
Teachers’ Federation” is including among other demands the 
establishment of educational councils such as I advocate, but 
the dictatorial and belligerent manner in which those demands 
have been urged may lead to vicious use of privileges extorted 
by poltical force. Such an attitude and spirit are as abnoxious 
to true organization as the inert and stagnant conditions they 
replace. It is not privileges, but duties and opportunities of 
high service that I would have considered. It is to arouse 
individual consciousness of such duties and opportunities that 
I would have the teachers called upon for counsel.

The cause of the universal practice, in which one supposed 
expert dictates to hundreds of passive teachers, has been the 
necessity of centering the final power and responsibility in 
one man. Such final decision and power of control is a real 
necessity, but in the work of teaching the control ought not 
to be an arbitrary control of a passive rank and file, nor should 
decisions be without advice from those who are expected to 
perform the delicate work for which the entire system exists. 
John Stuart Mill has well said, “Whatever crushes individ- 
uality is despotism, by whatever name it be called.” 
Organization means spontaneous cdoperation in a natural 
spirit of responsibility for mutual support. Because financier- 
ing combinations have been successfully administered without 
being truly organized, it has been supposed that school systems 
could be prospered by like administration. But in this error it 
has been forgotten that a dividend was the simple object of the 
financiering combination, whereas a system of schools should 
be true organism (not mere combination), and its parts can 
subsist healthfully only in an atmosphere of confidence and fel- 
lowship and through mutual service. The work of schools re- 
quires for true success far more than the executive ability of 
an autocrat. A Superintendent of schools may easily make 
a test of his own fitness: do his opinions receive consideration 
for their merit, or must they always be backed by his au- 
thority?

A MOTHER’S ESTIMATE OF THE KINDERGARTEN. 
MRS, E, C, CRONK, COLUMBIA, 8. C. 
Tue only thing which entitles me to the attention of this 
Association is a five-year-old boy. 
I am not a kindergartener. I have been asked to speak from 
the view-point of a mother. 
My language will likely betray me as an alien in your midst, 
for I know not your technical terms. But I come to you fresh 
from a daily (and oftimes a nightly) “point of contact” with 
the object of your study.
-P-A-G-E-33
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 83 
For bringing one face to face with the real issue there is 
nothing like constant association with a real, flesh-and-blood, 
five-year-old boy. As an exploder of beautiful (but only par- 
tially) true theories he stands unexcelled. 
I used to have a great many beautiful theories. Now I have 
a five-year-old boy. The “poor-little-helpless-child” theory was 
one of the first ones to go up, consumed by the marvelous per- 
severance of a mite of humanity, who soon reduced the entire 
family to a state of unconscious subjection. 
The very helplessness of a child invests him with a power 
which is a menace to future relationships. 
One of the ablest physicians in Atlanta was delivering a 
lecture to baby’s family on the evils of the “pacifier.” The 
baby, who was on the doctor’s lap, began to cry loudly. The 
doctor was so much interested in her theme that, uncon- 
sciously, she reached for the reviled “pacifier” tied around 
the baby’s neck, and, sticking it between the two little lips 
opened in victorious confidence, she continued her warnings to 
the family. Meanwhile the “poor-little-helpless-baby,” who had 
attained his own ends in his own way, contentedly sucked in 
bacteria. 
So, we mothers find ourselves almost unconsciously doing 
the things that we would not. 
As strong a plea to kindergarten as the helplessness of the 
child is the helplessness of the average mother who knows not 
how to make the most of the opportunity which has come to 
her. Each day brings to me a stronger realization of my own 
weakness and Jack of wisdom and tact and a stronger desire 
for genuine help in training my boy for life. 
Then there is the “plastic-clay” theory. You notice I speak 
of it in the past tense, so far as I am concerned. It has figured 
largely in Sunday school addresses and in poetic literature. 
It has a nice sentiment in it, and then it rhymes easily with 
“every day,” “the proper way,” ete. 
One soon learns, however, that a boy is not mass of inert, 
unresisting material, just waiting to receive impressions of 
kindness, truthfulness, unselfishness, and kindred virtues, to 
be made in a single day and set back to dry over night. 
So I found as the days went by that I did not know nearly 
as much about the proper training of a child as I had thought 
3
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
I did when I had observed the lack of it in other people’s chil- 
dren. The very things I had resolved to do I knew not how 
to do, and the weaknesses I had scorned in other mothers be- 
came my own. I even found myself on the verge of resorting 
to that weak, ridiculed, and unscientific, but withal time-hon- 
ored and strikingly effective method of discipline—“Now if 
you do not do as I tell you, I am going to tell your father when 
he comes home.” 
I recall these experiences that you may know from what 
viewpoint I estimate the kindergarten. I was not seeking a 
place to leave my child where he would be nursed and amused 
so that I might be free to attend to more important matters. 
I realized that the most important matter for me was the right 
training of my child. I realized also that I needed trained 
help for that training. Then I decided that, although the boy 
was not three years old, I would take him to visit the kinder- 
garten and quietly estimate, during the visit, its possibilities 
for help. 
I think I must have been exceedingly fortunate in my choice 
of a kindergarten. As soon as I opened the door that morning 
I began to make up my estimate. The first breath was a breath 
of pure fresh air, filled with sunshine, with the pleasant voices 
of little children and that indescribable, all-pervading atmos- 
phere ef peace and happiness which seems to me to be always 
a very part of that room. 
I place a high estimate on the value of atmosphere as a part 
of nurture, so I have tried to ‘analyze and dissect the atmos- 
phere of that room. The pictures on the walls, the exquisite 
order of neatness of the room and its contents, the imprisoned 
light of the sunbeam, the quiet music of the piano—all of these 
I can reproduce and take home in sections—but I wonder some- 
times, in despair, if that atmosphere would not still be part of 
the room, if all these things were removed and there yet re- 
mained the gentle genius of the place, who seems to breathe 
her very spirit into all those who enter that room. 
Soon after we were seated, the teacher brought out a box of 
blocks and proceeded to count out eight for the little visitor. 
But with the complacent monoply of the only child who has 
had no younger brother to take from him his birthright of 
individual ownership of playthings, the little visitor reached
-P-A-G-E-35
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 85 
upward and laid hold upon the whole box of blocks. The 
teacher explained that each child had only eight blocks and en- 
deavored to draw the box away. The little visitor held to it 
with a tenacity which was far from “helpless,” meanwhile re- 
inforcing the weakness of his hands with the strength of his 
lungs. A mortified mother arose to enforce order, but quickly, 
almost as if by magic, the teacher, blocks and boy disappeared 
through the door into the hall. What took place at that ses- 
sion, which proceeded behind closed doors, you kindergarteners 
know better than I. I only know the result. When she re- 
turned the child to his mother the evil spirit was gone from 
him and he sat down with smiling contentment—and eight 
blocks. 
No kindergarten exhibit of “pieces” spoken with perfect ac- 
cent, of songs, or of marches and skips executed in exact time, 
or of table after table of handwork, could have given me as 
high an estimate of that kindergarten as did that exhibit of 
the prompt securing of cheerful, happy obedience. Of course, 
the boy remained at kindergarten. 
I value highly the manual training of the kindergarten and 
all of its training of body and senses, but of far greater worth 
to me has been its moral and spiritual undercurrent. 
I do not mean that I should value a kindergarten in which 
the teacher meet her little pupils at the door with a handful of 
tacks, a hammer, and an assortment of moral precepts which 
she constantly endeavored to tack on, but when these precepts 
are a part of the weaving, in the work and the play, they be- 
come a very part of the child. The basket-laden Thanksgiving 
visit to the old people’s home means more than the unaccom- 
panied repetition of the precept, “Follow after charity.” 
I saw day after day that the kindergarten was doing for my 
boy what Elisha had prayed the Lord to do for his frightened 
servant: “I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see.” Day 
by day I noted eyes opening to things around, before unseen. 
He saw trees and birds, and flowers and jeweled raindrops, 
and over all, and in all—God, in the most natural way. 
I almost marveled at the natural way in which moral train- 
ing entered into every department of the work of that kinder- 
garten. I value highly the skill acquired in the accurate fold- 
ing of little pieces of paper, but I value more highly the train-
-P-A-G-E-36
    36 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ing which enables one to read on those blank places so many 
beautiful unwritten stories, and to see through those little win- 
dows so many beautiful views, while higher still in my scale 
of valuations stand some lessons learned in the distribution 
of those papers, and the passing of them along to others ac- 
cording to direction. 
I value very highly the kindergarten games, but I value just 
as highly the lesson of unselfiish consideration of others taught 
in the choice of a game. To my mind, a kindergarten which 
has become a mere manual and physical training school has 
still much worth, but it has lost more. When it becomes a 
school which exaggerates moral admonition, it has lost that 
which it sought to gain. 
I was impressed with the fact that the kindergarten I have 
observed most closely really did lead into more perfect develop- 
ment and expression the physical, mental and spiritual life of 
the child. 
One thing which impresses me strongly is that the value of 
kindergarten training depends to a great extent on the indi- 
vidual teacher. There are some general, sweeping statements 
which may be made of all kindergarten work, but it seems to 
me that the most important equipment of any kindergarten is 
the teacher. It is hard for a teacher to teach to others lessons 
she has never learned herself. It is almost impossible to im- 
part to a little child principles that are not part of oneself. 
So that teacher who has not been taught in the school of Him 
who took little children in his arms and blessed them, has 
missed the first and best course of kindergarten training. 
I have given you a mother’s estimate of the kindergarten. 
May I add a mother’s appreciation and thanks? I am not an 
empowered representative of Southern motherhood, but I as- 
sume responsibility for thanking you in the name of Southern 
mothers for what you have done and are doing for us and for 
our children. In estimating my balance sheet I acknowledge 
a heavy debt to the kindergarten and to you who are giving so 
much earnest study and skilled help to the training of our 
children. I might sum up my estimate in a few words. I went 
to the kindergarten seeking real help. I found what I sought 
and more.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPHR.] 
A SUGGESTED SECONDARY CURRICULUM FOR THE 
BOY OR GIRL WHO WILL NOT GO TO COLLEGE. 
HENRY S. WEST, PH. D., 
Assistant Superintendent of Public Instruction, Baltimore, Md. 
Our proposed secondary curriculum, in order to be a worthy 
educational programme, must accomplish a fourfold develop- 
ment in every pupil: a physical development, an intellectual 
development, a manual development, and a moral development. 
As to moral development and the means of securing it in the 
school, we should not, perhaps, amid the prevalent variety of 
opinion and dearth of knowledge on the subject, advocate any 
specific instruction in ethics, but rather let moral training, for 
the present at least, be given through the discipline, co-opera- 
tive life, and general exercises of the school, through the per- 
sonal influence of the teachers, and through attention to the 
ethical aspects of all the studies. With his moral development 
thus provided for, the pupil can, I believe, be developed physi- 
cally, intellectually, and manually, and in a way that will give 
him a thorough good general equipment for life under present 
day conditions, by following during his secondary course a 
programme of studies comprising the following ten subjects: 
the mother tongue, the two prevailing modern foreign lan- 
guages (which for us are German and French), mathematics, 
science, history, handicrafts, art, music, and physical culture. 
Turning to the problem of arranging these ten selected 
studies into an organized and workable programme, I shall 
assume that we are dealing with the common four-year secon- 
dary course, and that there is to be a daily schedule on the 
six-period basis, the weekly schedule thus consisting of thirty 
periods, but I propose to place the instruction and practice in 
physical culture in afternoon hours outside of the regular six- 
period scheme, and I should also provide for extra-schedule 
work in the handicrafts, so that pupils with aptitude in this 
direction might gain more knowledge and skill in craftsman- 
ship than the regular programme prescribes. Next I propose 
that the thirty periods of the weekly programme covering the 
instruction in the academic, manual, and art branches of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
388 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
curriculum (nine subjects) be apportioned as follows: pre- 
pared studies twenty periods; unprepared studies (handicrafts, 
art, and music), five periods; study under supervision five peri- 
ods—making each pupil’s daily programme consist, as nearly as 
possible, of four prepared lessons, one unprepared lesson, and 
one study period. And as to the twenty periods of specifically 
academic work, I propose to depart from the practice that has 
been most common since the notable report of the Committee 
of Ten, in that I plan to have the pupils pursue through each 
year five academic subjects concurrently, having four periods 
a week in each, instead of carrying but four academic subjects 
with five periods a week devoted to each. 
Casting into tabular form what has been proposed, I submit 
the following four-year curriculum: (See opposite page.) 
It will be observed at once that by the plan here presented 
one avoids the serious gaps often occurring in curricula ar- 
ranged on the four-subject basis; for example, the complete 
omission of history from one or two years with the consequent 
loss of instruction upon great historical periods. Here there 
is a continuous course through all four years in each of the 
five varieties of academic work, the mother tongue, the foreign 
languages, mathematics, science, and history; for, on leaving 
pure mathematics at the end of the second year in order to 
take up the second foreign language, the pupil goes into his 
physics and economics, sciences that require a continuation of 
mathematical thought and practice. Thus during each year 
the pupil is getting instruction and training in all five of the 
academic lines as well as in handicraft work, in art, in music, 
in physical culture, and last, but by no means least, in the 
right way to study. The effort has, therefore, been made to 
have each year’s programme as broad as possible without be- 
coming superficial, and at the same time to gain continuity 
and intensiveness of training by maintaining work in the sey- 
eral lines of study through the whole extent of the curriculum. 
By such an arrangement one would hope to see his pupils both 
develop the many-sided interest and grow in practical ef- 
ficiency. 
In defense of my deliberate exclusion of the classical lan- 
guages from the secondary curriculum here submitted, and to 
those who would retain at least Latin in every pupil’s curric-

can be developed, to the full extent to which the adolescent is 
capable of realizing it, by such study of English, German, and 
French as is provided for in the curriculum here submitted. 
In the third place, judging both from the considerable amount 
of secondary instruction in the classics that I have observed, 
and from my own experience with the classics, I accept with- 
out reserve certain notable sayings on the subject of the 
classics, uttered by Professor Laurie and Professor Hanus. 
Professor Laurie was, it seems to me, eminently right when, 
as long as twenty years ago, he declared, concerning the sym- 
pathetic study of English literature, “This, and not the spelling 
out with tears and vexation of a dozen lines of Virgil, is the 
humanities.” And Professor Hanus, too, is, it seems to me, no 
less right in his three assertions that “the modern idea of gen- 
eral culture is much broader than classical scholarship ;” that 
a secondary education consisting largely of Latin and Greek 
is, “for most of the great majority who never go to college, 
a perversion of opportunity and an economic and edu- 
cational waste,” because classical culture is not obtainable 
anyhow in the secondary school “by studying the classical lan- 
guages themselves ;” and that “a new culture and a new civili- 
zation have arisen since the Renaissance” with which the mod- 
ern man must get into full relation in order that he may have 
“the capacity to understand, appreciate, and react on the re- 
sources and problems of modern civilization.” With so much 
said by way of holding up the shield of authority, I respect- 
fully venture upon my own part the declaration that, in the 
present industrial age with its intense and intricately complex 
life, with its bristling economic problems enmeshing every one 
of us, it appears to me utterly absurd to make the boy whose 
schooling to end with the secondary course laboriously puzzle 
out the Latin description of the fortifications of a Roman 
camp or the mechanism of Cesar’s bridge across the Rhine, 
when he might be learning something about the mechanism of 
modern trade or the bridging of the chasm between capital and 
labor; and it appears to me little short of preposterous to make 
the same boy spend weeks in painfully trying to understand 
Cicero’s arguments in favor of the Manilian Law, instead of 
studying the law of a depreciated currency or the arguments 
in favor of and against the ubiquitous trusts.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.) 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS. 
J. F. DUGGER, 
Director Alabama Hxperiment Station, and Professor of Agriculture, 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute. 
Tue beginning of the movement to teach agriculture in sec- 
ondary institutions in the South dates back to 1889, when the 
State of Alabama establish two agricultural high schools. 
Now Alabama has a system of nine agricultural high schools, 
one in each congressional district, and it was the first State 
in the nation to make provision for State-wide instruction in 
agriculture in secondary schools. 
At the present time special agricultural schols constitute 
merely a small fraction of the high schools that are teaching 
agriculture. They are far outnumbered by the ordinary high 
schoois now teaching this subject. Moreover, a large number 
of normal schools are giving instruction in agriculture. 
The South has led. in the establishment of special agricul- 
tural schools, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Louisi- 
ana, Texas, Arkansas, and Virginia, each having a number of 
agricultural schools. 
In its best and most successful form the typical agricultural 
school of today meets the following requirements: 
1. It has a course of study closely parallel to that of the 
ordinary high school, and of equal educational and disciplinary 
value. 
2. Its curriculum provides for much theorectical and prac- 
tical instruction in the underlying principles and practical as- 
pects of crop production, horticulture, and animal production. 
3. In its curriculum a larger amount of time is given to the 
study of the natural sciences, especially chemistry and botany, 
than in the average high school. 
In short, the ideal agricultural school of secondary grade is 
an institution giving a sound and orthodox educational train- 
ing, fitting for any life work, but placing especial emphasis on 
the natural sciences, and supplying also a fair amount of voca- 
tional training. It is not a trade school, nor entirely a class  
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
school, and its final product is an intelligent American citi- 
zen, supplied also with the information that will make him 
able, if he so desires, to make farm life more profitable and 
more attractive than can those who lack this special training. 
The model of the agricultural school of this country is not the 
trade schools of agriculture so common in Europe for the train- 
ing of peasants. Its ideal is distinctively American. 
As a concrete example of how these ideals of agricultural 
education are being attained, I shall refer briefly to the agri- 
cultural and science studies required in the uniform curricu- 
lum of the nine district agricultural schools in Alabama. The 
course extends through four years and covers the usual high 
school grades, namely, the eighth to the eleventh inclusive. In 
each of the four years every pupil is required to spend two 
hours per week in practical field work on the school farm or in 
the gardens or grounds. The first year the textbook study is 
elementary agriculture, which, for many pupils is a review and 
amplification of the same subject universally required in public 
schools of the State. The second year a more advanced course 
is given in agriculture with special reference to field crops. 
This occupies half of the year, while botany, five hours per 
week, is the science study in the second term. In the third 
year botany is continued, and one term is given to the study 
of domestic animals, and the second term to the elements of 
horticulture, two hours per week. In the fourth year chemis- 
try, with laboratory work, extends through both terms. In 
this year agriculture in the first term may be either soils and 
fertilizers or dairying; in the second term local and special 
agricultural topics are studied in the bulletins of the State 
experiment stations and of the National Department of Agri- 
culture. 
In brief, this course requires, besides four years of weekly 
practice, three and a half years of text book instruction in 
some branch of agriculture. 
Naturally such a full course in agriculture as is demanded 
' in special agricultural schools having a vocational end cannot 
be given without some omissions from the usual high school 
course, and this sacrifice has been made in these institutions 
chiefly at the expense of foreign languages; however, oppor- 
tunity is afforded for the study of Latin as an elective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 43 
_ Agriculture has been included in the uniform course of study 
adopted for all of the county high schools of Alabama. In- 
stances by the score could be cited in all parts of the United 
States where ordinary high schools have successfully intro- 
duced the study of agriculture. 
I believe that without sacrificing the educational end to the 
vocational one, agriculture should be taught in the following 
classes of institutions, though to a smaller extent than in 
special agricultural schools. 
First, in high schools of county, village or town, or district, 
or in consolidated country schools—in short, wherever the 
dominant industry in agriculture. 
Second, in the normal schools of all States that require the 
teaching of agriculture in the public schools. 
Agriculture is here used in the widest sense of the word, as 
inclusive of the production of field crops, vegetables, flowers, 
fruits and trees, and the care of farm animals. As an educa- 
tional subject agriculture deals with all applications of the 
laws of chemistry, botany, and other branches of science to the 
production of plants and animals. Hence, it has broad educa- 
tional aspects and may be so taught.as to constitute a vehicle 
for unique mental training. 
Agriculture claims a place in the curricula of high schools: 
(1) Because of the educational value of the subject. 
(2) Because of the educational needs of the pupils. 
(3) Because of the industrial or vocational needs of the in- 
dividual, the community, the State, and the nation. 
When agriculture is properly taught the pupil is led to the 
observation of natural phenomena as revealed by plants and 
animals and the earth’s mantle of soil. A training is given 
to the faculties of observation and of generation such as is af- 
forded by no other subject. This character of training most 
nearly parallels that afforded by the study of botany. 
The study of agriculture should lead the pupil to make men- 
tal record of the familiar happenings, which usually merely flit 
across the vision without arousing thought or interest. It 
awakens curiosity, inquiry, interest, and with interest it de- 
velops attention. 
Normal schools and high schools find a reason for teaching 
agriculture in the educational needs of their pupils. The

greatest opportunity for specialization in teaching lies, I be- 
lieve, in preparation to teach agriculture and the group of 
natural sciences on which agriculture is based, especially chem- 
istry and botany. This is because there are fewer teachers 
trained to teach agriculture than to give instruction in any 
other required branch of public school work. 
In contrast with the supply of trained teachers note how 
great is the demand. The rapid and almost universal teaching 
of agriculture in the public schools is only limited by the sup- 
ply of teachers who have the necessary preparation or the 
needed interest and enthusiasm. Here lies one of the func- 
tions of the secondary schools—to prepare, at least partially, 
a great army of teachers with some knowledge of botany and 
chemistry and the principles of agriculture, and, most of all, 
with some conception of the high privilege and national use- 
fulness of their future teaching of the principles of agriculture. 
A preparation thus begun in the secondary schools will often 
awaken an interest leading to more specialized work at the 
higher institutions. 
The third reason why agriculture deserves a place in the 
curriculum, whether it be of grammar school, high school, or 
special agricultural institution, is because the study of agri- 
culture is the most universal means of promoting the economic 
good of the individual, the community, the State, and the 
nation. 
Consider for a moment what stupendous issues depend upon 
the productiveness of our fields. In all this recent cry of con- 
servation of our natural resources it is universally recognized 
that our chief and most permanent asset is the soil, and our 
only renewable wealth the crops and trees which spring from 
it and the animals that build their bodies from the earth-born 
grass. 
Up to this time we have properly proclaimed that public 
education is justified because it is a training for citizenship. 
We are now ready to define training for citizenship as that 
which not only best fits the individual to further the political 
and moral well-being of society, but also that training which 
fits him or her to conserve and enrich for posterity the ma- 
terial resources of the nation. 
The schools can make an effective contribution to the propa-

ganda for scientific education and thus add to the economic ad- 
vantage of every class of our peeple. Our soils, which should 
grow more productive with the passing years of scientific crop- 
ping, are being wasted through careless tillage and ignorant 
management. Let us be warned by the desolation of some of the 
abandoned plains of China, by the sterility of once productive 
Palestine, and by the recurring famines in India. To help to 
save the nation from calamities like these is a task worthy to 
be shared by the school, even though the end be economic, for 
an improved agriculture means a higher plane of living, ma- 
terial, moral, and mental, for the large body of the people. 
Fortunately, there is a remedy. This remedy is a double 
one, namely—first, agricultural investigation; and second, the 
universal promulgation of present and future knowledge of the 
laws of scientific agriculture.

AMERICAN IDEAS IN EDUCATION. 
ELMER §, BROWN. 
Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C. 
Tue story is told of an Indian family in Alaska, years ago, 
when the formal education of natives in that region was in its 
beginnings, who were persuaded with much difficulty to send 
their children to school. Going to school, as they understood 
it, meant to learn the white man’s wisdom, and the old Indians 
were not sure that they cared to have their children learn the 
white man’s wisdom. When at last they were persuaded, and 
one small boy began his daily schooling, he was eagerly ques- 
tioned at home concerning the lessons he had learned. The 
first day he had learned that c-a-t spells cat; a little later that 
the cat can eat a rat; a little later still that the cow has four 
legs and a tail. Little by little the wonder grew, that the 
white man’s wisdom had nothing better than this to offer, and 
at last in sheer disgust the boy was taken from school and 
left to get on as best he could with the red man’s wisdom— 
woodcraft, witchcraft, tribal customs, and the rest. 
I confess to a good deal of sympathy with the point of view 
of these old Indians. We do, indeed, sometimes forget that
-P-A-G-E-46
ee en er ee eT 
46 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the schools are concerned with imparting the best wisdom of 
our people. They sometimes lose themselves in training and 
technique. This has often happened in the history of schools. 
And yet all down the ages the idea has been present that the 
schools are to teach the way of wisdom and righteousness, and 
not simply to cultivate the wits and load the memory with 
knowledge. 
As one walks through the crowded streets or looks on any 
great concourse of our people, and still more, as one looks 
abroad over the whole land with a sense of its enormous popu- 
lation and diversified interests, the thought often comes, how 
great is the service of any leader who can bind this people 
more closely together by common thoughts and aspirations: 
by high thoughts and aspirations befitting our national great- 
ness; not lightly held, but really shaping our national senti- 
ments and making their way out into living deeds. Such a 
result cannot be brought about merely by conscious efforts 
dealing with altogether new materials. What can be done is 
to take the ideas which are already abroad in our national 
life, the ideas which have indeed made our national life what 
it is, and bring them into clearer emphasis. 
With such an end in view, what we have now to do is to 
review some of the ideas which may in some special sense be 
called American, even though our hold upon them be not a 
monopoly, and see if we cannot find ways of giving them a 
larger place in our American education. 
The first great American symbol which meets the immigrant 
coming to this country is the statue of liberty enlightening the 
world. To make more clear to all our people what liberty 
earlier colonists, at least in the minds of the best of our 
colonial leaders. There is perhaps no one conception for 
which America stands more distinctly in the eyes of all the 
world. To make more clear to all our people what liberty 
means must be a cardinal object of American education. 
It is easy to show, but we sometimes forget to show, that the 
only liberty that is possible in this world is that which comes 
through self-government. Self-government and freedom, then, 
are to be taught as two sides of the same shield, two elements, 
individual so long as our rational character shall not be lost 
in dissolution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. AT 
We may think of human life as a passing back and forth on 
various undertakings along the highroad of our time. If there 
were no regulation, no restraint, this highroad would be the 
scene of endless collisions betweeen those moving in opposite 
directions. Government is regulation which provides that all 
shall pass to the one side or the other, so that collisions may be 
avoided and free movement be assured. But if some are given 
right of way over all others, many may still be crowded to the 
wall and placed at hopeless disadvantage. Liberty means that 
the passers on the highway shall themselves, and all of them, 
have part in making the regulations by which the highway is 
controlled, that so far as possible none shall have special privi- 
lege to override another. This in part is what liberty means 
in America, that all shall have their share in making the regu- 
lations by which free movement is secured to all. 
We can hardly conceive of the improvement that would 
come into our national life in a thousand different directions 
if the genuine American idea should become firmly fixed in the 
minds of all our citizens, that the only liberty is that which 
goes with self-control. 
So our idea of government is that which should proceed from 
the people and in turn should further the independence of the 
people. Government with us is a way of making people bet- 
ter able to take care of themselves. The national government 
is to strengthen and not weaken the government of the States; 
the States are to strengthen and not weaken the local govern- 
ment of counties, municipalities, and other political units. 
Even when, for the common good, it is found necessary to 
strengthen the central authority, the end in view is largely 
that of giving a fair chance to those who would otherwise be 
overridden. The government of our new outlying possessions 
is directed mainly to rendering them capable of self-govern- 
ment. Every year our governmental institutions come to be 
more of the very nature of educational institutions. 
For the greatest spirits among the founders of our institu- 
tions, liberty meant first of all religious freedom. We cannot 
overestimate the significance of this historic fact, that our 
spirit of freedom was grounded in the spirit of religion. Even 
if in our own day religious freedom is often interpreted to 
mean freedom to be irreligious, which is indeed some part of  
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
its meaning, by far the strongest strand of historic continuity 
in the development of our liberties is the sentiment which de- 
mands freedom for every man to be religious in the way that 
for him is most real and inspiring. The most ancient ortho- 
doxy, as well as the most modern religious experiment, finds 
under these conditions fair encouragement to make its best 
appeal to men, and fair chance to put its doctrines to the test 
of present needs. A wonderfully rich and genuine religious 
life is the outgrowth of these conditions. Because of our re- 
ligious freedom we may not permit in our public schools in- 
struction in the peculiar tenets of any church. We have in- 
stead the privilege of making clear the meaning and value of 
that freedom which has fostered the religious life of our peo- 
ple and made it a power for peace and righteousness. 
One great wave of democracy in this country was religious, 
and especially Calvinistic in its origin. Another great wave 
was humanitarian and associated with the ideas of France in 
revolution. Our own revolution declared that all men were 
created equal. In all of the varying interpretations of this 
saying there is a fair measure of agreement among us that men 
should at least be equal in opportunity, equal before the law, 
equal as regards the sacredness of their personal rights. The 
whole meaning of a democracy which aims at such equality is 
not to be learned in a single generation. It is a lesson set for 
us, a national lesson which we have as yet mastered only in 
part. The American people are all at school and must for a 
long age yet be at school, striving to learn the full meaning of 
their own democracy. 
Even so far as we have gone with this lesson we have learned 
so much as this, that the ordinary education uf the common 
schools is one of the main things to be cared for in making 
good for our people this endeavor after equality of oppor- 
tunity. And so the very existence of the schools together with 
compulsory attendance laws and laws to relieve children from 
unsuitable labor, that such attendance may be possible—all 
of these things are evidence of our attempt to secure for all a 
fair opportunity, even if any absolute equality is still beyond 
our reach. 
We very well know that equality of education must result 
in inequality of attainment. Our American democracy. does 
not expect to find any flat uniformity in human nature. It
-P-A-G-E-49
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 49 
expects diversity of gifts and prizes the qualities that make 
for leadership; at the same time it recognizes the fact that 
leadership is and must be of many kinds, offering opportunity 
for a wide variety of genius. Our schools do not as yet make 
it a conscious part of their aim to seek out and bring to the 
front the qualities which make for leadership. Yet respect 
for competent and inspiring leaders is abroad among our peo- 
ple, and our schools must inevitably come to more definite ef 
forts to develop such leadership. That unusual powers are to 
be regarded as gifts held in trust for the good of all, is one of 
the lessons of our essential democracy. In a broader sense, 
the idea of public service as a duty for all is an idea which our 
very democratic aspirations would prompt the teachers in our 
schools to emphasize. 
Our American society is accordingly one characterized by 
everlasting readjustment. Our unlimited opportunity is pos- 
sible because no man’s status is fixed for life. In particular, 
no man’s status is fixed for life to the detriment of any of his 
fellows. A fair chance for every one is our aim, and we are 
a little less than Americans if we do not believe in giving to 
every man such a chance. We call it the square deal. There is 
no American characteristic better worthy of encouragement 
than that which stands for the square deal. 
But the fair chance and the square deal need to be joined, 
as they are pretty generally joined, with brotherhood. We 
have to guard against the notion that individual opportunity 
means opportunity to rise at the expense of others. Ours is a 
government that promotes self-government, but it is of the 
greatest importance that self-governing people shall pull to- 
gether. Codperation in a thousand forms, free codperation, is 
another of the best things of our American life. To cultivate 
the idea of team work and the spirit that makes team work 
possible is accordingly one of the American ends to be attained 
by American schools. 
Freedom, self-control, codperation—these call for attention 
in our industrial life. With all of our new emphasis upon in- 
dustrial education, we require new emphasis upon those Ameri- 
can qualities which shall hold our industrial undertakings to 
practices consistent with good citizenship, or shall swing them 
back to such practices when they depart therefrom.

From the beginning ours has been a land which offered a 
wide welcome to foreigners who should come to us to be 
Americans with us. This is still a cardinal American doctrine. 
We are a people who refuse to regard the foreigner as a foe 
because he is a foreigner. As all peoples on the earth have 
taken a deep interest in the fortunes of our republic, so our 
interests and sympathies havé gone out to all peoples. If 
America is, as Mr. William Stead has declared, the one great 
international country on the earth, our foreign policy may be 
expected to have back of it the constant interest of our people 
in other nations. To strengthen that interest and make it 
more intelligent is among the aims proper to our schools. Our 
spirit of fair play, the spirit of free codperation, these things 
are to be with us international in their scope, and are to make 
us a people which shall influence all nations through the lofti- 
ness and pervasiveness of our ideals. 
This is but a hasty glance at some of those sentiments and 
convictions which make our American character American in 
the better sense of the word. These things go into the making 
of American wisdom for our American schools. There is dan- 
ger in the special propaganda of sentiments which are con- 
cerned merely with the success of a government or form of 
government. Too narrowly prescribed inculcation of specific 
doctrines is by all means to be avoided. But the emphasis 
upon those things which has made the character of our people 
at its best, and on which the maintenance of their character 
at its best is seen to be vitally dependent, such emphasis is to 
be warmly promoted, and our schools thereby will the better 
come to their rightful place and influence.

BIOLOGICAL FACTOR IN THE ELEMENTARY CUR- 
RICULUM. 
L, A. ROBINSON, 
Superintendent cf Winthrop Training School, Rock Hill, 8. C. 
Tue school curriculum has been based largely upon tradi- 
tion, and men in writing courses of study have given almost 
no consideration to the physical welfare of the child. In other 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 51 
words, educators have attended to the training of the mind, 
but have neglected the body. Even the subject of physiology 
seemed for a time to be an added sin against the health of the 
child by increasing rather than diminishing the nervous strain 
on the pupils of our schools. However, this subject is now be- 
coming a more practical requirement, but in order to realize 
the full benefits to the children the theory of hygiene must be 
supplemented by health-producing activities, and by attention 
to proper nutrition of the pupils in school. 
All subjects in school have their dynamic phase, especially 
in the primary grades. Action must accompany all learning. 
The child needs to handle his blocks and sticks in counting; 
he needs to dramatize his reading by real action; he needs to 
test the reality of geography by experience with nature out of 
doors; and, in general, he needs to live his mental activities 
out in physical responses. These facts emphasized by the 
value of muscular activity, demand that the motor and physi- 
cal factors in teaching should receive more attention than they 
now do in most places. While the teaching of all subjects in- 
clude muscular activity, which is an essential element of 
health, still there are subjects in school especially adapted to 
affect the physical welfare of the children. These subjects in- 
clude writing, drawing, sewing, and the manual arts and in- 
dustries, vocal music, nature study, gymnastics, play, domestic 
science, and all subjects requiring motor activity. 
There are many reasons for having vocal music in the 
schools, but its presence in the curriculum can be justified 
from the standpoint of health alone. Its effect in calming the 
mind and resting the nerves makes it a tonic to the whole 
system. 
“Music the fiercest grief can charm, 
And fate’s severest rage disarm. 
Music can soften pain to ease, 
And make Gespair and madness please.”       
Besides relinquishing the nervous tension in the school 
room, singing gives restful physical activity and breathing 
exercise. The muscles, cramped from sitting long in one posi- 
tion, become rested and the lungs constricted from stooping 
over a desk will be filled with air and rejuvenated by a few 
minutes of lively vocal effort. Music should be prescribed in 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
every course of study as a daily exercise. Most emphasis 
should be given to it in the lower grades where not less than 
twenty minutes a day should be devoted to singing. 
Nature study, observational geography, agriculture, and 
school gardening may be intimately correlated, and constitute 
a health-promoting group. Besides giving mind culture and 
land culture, this group of subjects affords good physical cul- 
ture. The outdoor exercises and fresh air needed for carry- 
ing on these subjects are very valuable for relieving the ner- 
vous fatigue due to the school room. Scarcely enough can be 
said in favor of these subjects. The school garden is especially 
valuable in affording a kind of laboratory for the other sub- 
jects of the group and furnishing the outdoor exercise so con- 
ducive to vigorous health. In the severe climate of Massa- 
chusetts school gardens would seem more ornamental than 
practical, and yet they are becoming very common in that 
State. How much more should school gardens be the rule in the 
South, where agriculture is the chief pursuit and the climate 
permits the children to work in the garden a large part of the 
winter! The time spent in the garden will not be wasted by 
the child even if he does not expect to earn his living by farm 
work. It brings him close to nature. Contact with the ground 
gives him strength to cope with the adversities of life as it 
gave strength of resistence to the mythical hero of old. 
Perhaps there is no school activity more vitally important 
to the physical welfare of the child than gymnastics and play. 
Without physical training the subject of hygiene becomes a 
farce and a falsehood. Further, without the health and vigor 
that comes from gymnastics and pleasurable exercise, the men- 
tal training of the child will only increase his misery. It 
seems as fortunate to be ignorant and well as to be learned 
and weak. Nothing earthly will justify the sacrifice of health. 
But health cannot be perserved without exercise. To cease 
moving is to cease growing and die. The gymnasium and the 
playground must belong to every well equipped school. Rec- 
ord-making in athletics is not our special need, but the general 
physical training of our children is an integral part of their 
education is the essential thing. The physical training of chil- 
dren should not be confined to the time of recess or vacation. 
It should form a part of the curriculum itself.
-P-A-G-E-53
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 53 
One difficulty, however, must not be overlooked, even after 
having gymnasiums and playgrounds provided. That difficulty 
is the problem of securing teachers who can direct physical 
training. 
Great, indeed, is the need of leadership in this field of train- 
ing. As is indicated by President Hall, there must be a unifi- 
cation of aims, and a concerted movement of educators to ad- 
vance physical training along the broadest lines in order to 
give it sufficient prominence in the curriculum. Some teachers 
prize gymnastics for the training of muscles alone, some for 
correction of form and development of proportions, some for 
volitional control in responding to commands, while some prize 
only the play element of physical training. Now, it is readily 
seen that any one of these is only a part of the whole elephant. 
The complete animal includes them all. It should be recog- 
nized that formal gymnastics which require close attention 
and vigorous muscular effort are more work than play and do 
not rest the pupil so much as is popularly believed. Some un- 
restrained play is needed. “All work and no play makes Jack 
a dull boy.” The play element of physical training deserves 
some special consideration beyond what is now generally in- 
cluded in gymnastics. 
Play is a synonym for youth and strength. It is the typical 
exercise for promoting physical vigor and stimulating mental 
powers. If games requiring the use of a large number of 
muscles, and keeping the children in the open air much of the 
time, be used the physical benefit is doubly valuable. Not only 
is muscular strength thus developed, but the functioning power 
of the vital organs—heart, liver, lungs, ete—is greatly im- 
proved. But play does more than aid the physical body; it is 
a prime factor in the mental and moral development of the 
child. If you want to judge of the progress in a school ask the 
children, not what they study, but what they play. In this 
way you are more likely to get the true spirit of the school 
without sham or pretense. Hall says of play, “It gives not 
only strength, but courage and confidence, tends to simplify 
life and habits, gives energy, decision and promptness to the 
will, brings consolation and peace of mind in evil days, is a 
resource in trouble and brings out indiviuality. And yet 
courses of study do not even require a recess nor provide a
-P-A-G-E-54
54 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
time for play. This should be done. Not only should the 
school curriculum prescribe a liberal amount of recess time, 
but should prescribe it for the definite purpose of play, and 
should suggest games which will help the teacher when neces- 
sary to give encouragement to play. The teacher should not 
be allowed to punish children by keeping them in at recess, 
for this prevents them from taking part in the very activities 
that aid most in improving their conduct. It is well to have 
the play as spontaneous as possible. Restraint and direction 
by the teacher detracts from the enthusiasm, and yet it is often 
necessary for the teacher to take an active part in order to get 
satisfactory results. The teacher should feel the necessity of 
getting the children to play, and, if he be at all tactful, can 
generally “secure appropriate games and sports by mere sug- 
gestion. In some cases it may be necessary for the teacher to 
direct the play or game as though it were a lesson in gymnas- 
tics. But whatever the method used, play should be encour- 
aged for the welfare of the children. 
But there is another problem of vital importance to the 
physical welfare of school children: How shall they be fed at 
school? It does not seem wise to attempt to do it at public 
expense alone. The problem will vary much according to local 
conditions. Perhaps the easy way out of it is for the school 
authorities to have nothing to do with it, and simply let the 
children provide for themselves the best they can by bringing 
lunches when they live too far away to go home to dinner. 
This means a cold, dry lunch which at best is unpalatable, and 
at worst is a producer of riots and treasons in the stomach. 
One difficulty is that many of the mothers do not know how 
to prepare a wholesome noon-day luncheon for school; some 
send dry unnutritious food; others send rich nick-nacks ruin- 
ous to the most iron-clad stomach. What can the educator do 
in the next matter? One way of solving the problem is to 
have the school equipped with cooking ranges so that the chil- 
dren may warm their lunches and prepare under the direction 
of the teacher one or two wholesome dishes. In this way do- 
mestic science may become a practical subject in even the rural 
schools. Hear what a country school teacher of Michigan says 
on this subject: “Oh, that dinner pail! Who does not know it 
with its tempting and nutritious array of pie, cake, pickles,
-P-A-G-E-55
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 55 
and tarts, or worse, its yellow ‘sody biscuits, dried apple sass 
and fried fat pork! Yes, cold, greasy, fat prok! Then think 
of a child who walks from half a mile to two miles to school, 
rain or shine, snow or sleet, and who is expected to apply him- 
self to the industrious pursuits of knowledge, living on such 
cold dinners during eight or ten months of the year!” A very 
little trouble and expense would furnish every district with the 
necessary cooking utensils, and the work of preparing the din- 
ner and washing the dishes, could, in most instances, be done 
by the pupils, who, with a little tactful guidance by a sensible 
teacher, would consider it a privilege to assist in the. house- 
keeping. 
Another solution for the city schools, is to provide a lunch 
counter in the basement at which the children can buy a bowl 
of hot soup and other substantials at small cost. In some 
cities the schools have lunch rooms provided with tables at 
which the children eat their lunches. A lunch counter is fre- 
quently available for supplying additional food at cost. It 
needs to be recognized that any one method will not work 
equally well in every community. But this fact does not lessen 
the duty of the educators to plan for the physical welfare of 
the child in nutrition so far as possible as well as in other 
needs. It seems that domestic science must inevitably enter 
the activities of the elementary school. If other argument 
were not sufficient for putting cooking into the curriculum, its 
utility for maintaining the health of the children in school 
ought to be sufficient for its introduction. 
In conclusion I would insist upon more attention to the. 
physical welfare of children than is now given to it in school. 
“In every school there should be direct instruction given to 
every pupil in hygiene and sanitation. In addition there 
should be competent supervision of physical exercise to the 
end that every pupil may leave school stronger than when he 
entered. Health and growth and strength should be improved 
by the days which the child spends at school.” Every subject 
and exercise prescribed in a curriculum should be considered 
from the standpoint of physical welfare to the child. The sub- 
jects which relate especially to the physical health and strength 
should receive greater prominence than they now do in the 
curriculum. From one-fourth to one-third of the time in the  
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL’ ASSOCIATION. 
elementary programme should be devoted to these health-pro- 
ducing activities. Care should be used to have daily pro- 
grammes alternate subjects so as to avoid having the children 
under one kind of nervous strain long at a time. The general 
rule should be to have short periods of concentrated effort and 
frequent changes, special emphasis being given to this in the 
primary grades where the mental exercises should not exceed 
fifteen minutes at a time. 
Finally, let me urge that education without health is no edu- 
cation at all. Healthy bodies are the greatest hope of the na- 
tion and race. When the cities of Greece neglected physical 
training decay began. “Health is the soul that animates all 
the enjoyments of life, which fade and are tasteless without 
it.” “Without health life is not life; it is only a state of lan- 
guor and suffering—an image of death.” Under the heavy re- 
sponsibility that educators have in directing and supervising 
the activities of children during such an important part of 
their life, it behooves each one to give attention to the require- 
ments of nutrition and health in order that we may raise up 
a race with strong bodies with which to serve their country 
and their God. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
CORRELATION OF PRIMARY WORK. 
MABEL LEE COOPER, MEMPHIS, TENN, 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
In this day, when everything must be taught in the primary 
grades, it is the primary teacher who must see to it that none 
of the important branches, so necessary to the development 
of a well-rounded education of the child, is neglected; for if 
one is neglected, a warp will surely be detected in the founda- 
tion of the child’s education. 
Now, the question arises: How can the primary teacher 
develop along all the lines in the short time usually allotted 
to her? 
After many years experience in the primary department of 
a large public school, I have found no other way save that of 
correlation. And there must be a center for this correlation.
-P-A-G-E-57
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 57 
Again, my experience has been that industrial education forms 
the best center, since it demands that the child do the thing 
as well as to see it or try to say it. The industrial center as- 
similates the best in all the other branches because it is so 
full of activity and expression. All child-life is overflowing 
with activity and these activities are only the natural expres- 
sion of his innate impulses. Activity is necessary to child life 
and it is the purpose of industrial education to direct this 
activity into useful channels, so that it will be a pleasure and 
a future benefit. 
Let us enter the vast realm of story telling and consider for 
a few moments the great classic of childhood—‘Mother 
Goose.” The child is nurtured upon these rhymes, they are 
his share, his undisputed heritage in the great realm of stories 
and literature. The fortunate child hears, learns, reads, marks 
and inwardly digests them at a fond parent’s knee, and when 
he enters school, his mind stored with them, how happy he is 
to meet old friends and how delighted he will be in his paper 
cutting and drawing, when he is told to cut or draw “Little 
Boy Blue,” “Jenny Wren,” “Old Woman in Her Shoe,” 
“Tommy Tucker” and many, many others. How much more 
real will seem the excited race, when the dish ran away with 
the spoon, if it is illustrated on the sand table or in a booklet, 
the result of the child’s own handiwork. After thus drama- 
tizing the working out these rhymes, what a part they become 
of child life and what a pattern in the future study of great 
classics. And do they not become a very part of our life? For 
where is the grown up child, who would willingly crowd out 
from his memory the characters of “Mother Goose?” These 
names are to us the echoes of a royal past, when our wills 
were rarely ever disputed, when we ruled with a despotism 
not tolerated in monarchs of large size, and our imperial man- 
dates were issued from a throne, the foundation of which never 
trembled—a mother’s knee. 
It must be remembered that in the correlation of story tell- 
ing and industrial work—the languages, writing and spelling 
is made a great feature; the child’s vocabulary is increased; 
his memory strengthened, his ingenunity of mind and skill of 
hand is developed; neatness and accuracy are encouraged and 
his general information increased. Thus with the aid of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. * 
sand table, paper, scissors, paste, etc., the necessary industrial 
equipment of the primary grades, story telling is so correlated 
with industrial training as to become a very serious factor in 
the education of the child rather than a mere means to amuse 
him. 
The favorite story, “The Leak in the Dyke,” can be made a 
lesson in geography, reading, spelling, language and composi- 
tion as well as an interesting story and a lesson in courage. 
In the presentation of this story the peculiarity of the land 
and water in this strange country, the dykes and their use to 
the people, the wind mills, the Dutch children with their 
wooden shoes, the typical home of the brave little boy can be 
so plainly shown on the sand table. Our boys and girls can 
see exactly how he stopped the leak and surely the written 
or spoken reproduction of the story will be more animated and 
intelligent and the lesson it should teach planted deeply in 
their hearts. 
In the higher primary grades, in the study of geography and 
history, the possibilities of the sand table are limitless, think 
of the numbers of things that can be done—stories of primitive 
life told in miniature pictures in the sand, Puritan life, 
colonial life, stories from Greek, Roman and English history, 
Norman castles, building of canals, the desert with its oasis, 
palm trees, its caravan or camels and Arabs. These little 
scenes, when worked out by pupils give them an understand- 
ing and awaken an interest in far away lands and customs 
that months of study from their books would not have given 
them. 
Hand work furnishes the best and broadest elementary 
study of all the past, and there is no better way to open the 
study of history and all the sciences than through hand work. 
Industrial education, rightly directed in the primary grades, 
is a source of interest and pleasure and profit which is de- 
manded by the modern child and which is now recognized as 
necessary in his education. In the whole educational process 
there is nothing more interesting than to watch the growth 
of power through the industrial training. 
The little craftsmen in the primary grades, who are just be- 
ginning their hand work, are so manifestly helpless, it may 
seem discouraging to see the lack of co-ordination among their
-P-A-G-E-59
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 59 
faculties the absence of any real accuracy or originality. But 
where there are normal children to work with, the change is 
marvelous, control takes the place of lack of control, stupidity 
gives place to alertness, awkwardness to dexterity; grad- 
ually the hands begin to obey the brain and in a short time the 
children gain an immense amount of’ power; if this training 
is directed in the primary grades the more difficult tasks of 
manual work in the higher grades are easily performed. 
But aside from its adaptability to correlation of almost all 
branches taught in primary grades, industrial training has an 
educative value peculiarly its own. It, more than any other 
phase of education, compels a child to go through life observ- 
ing and seeing things. It teaches him to see beauty in com- 
mon things and to find happiness in the things that appeal to 
the senses, it trains him to stop and listen and observe every 
time he hears or sees a beautiful thing. In action drawing, it 
compels him to notice life and action of the human figure, 
birds, animals and insects. In the constructive work of mak- 
ing boxes, furniture, etc., it trains him in accuracy and design 
and develops the creative faculty. 
In his landscape drawings, however crude, it takes him out 
of doors, makes him observe the growth of blossoms, fruits 
and trees—the shape and color of flowers and plants. A little 
child stands looking at a beautiful tree, he is told to look at 
it once, twice, five times. It is a grand old apple tree, full of 
rose petals of pink and white. At first it-is only a tree, but he 
looks again, and oh, how beautiful and how fragrant it is. An- 
other look—the branches sway, there are patches of light and 
the blue sky is revealed. Again he looks—there is a bird, the 
mother bird and the little ones; he hears them sing and fly 
away. Grace, color and song have added another charm to the 
picture already beautiful. Strength, color, perfume, life, mo- 
tion, song, all have appealed to the sensitive soul of the child. 
He sees again and again the old apple tree and carries the 
picture of its beauty in his soul for all time. It is well that 
he did not stop with one look at the tree, for, looking again, 
he saw, felt and knew more of beauty, more of delight, which 
filled his soul. 
Now, if we can train the child to an appreciation of nature 
by observing the beauty and wonder of it, how much more inti-
-P-A-G-E-60

mately it is brought home to him when he tries to delineate that 
beauty himself? 
A wise psychologist tells us: “A thing is scarcely.our own 
until we have tried in some way to express it.” 
And this is why we encourage tree drawing and cutting and 
other nature studies in paper cutting, in mass and in color in 
our public schools. 
Froebel has said: “The things of nature form a more beauti- 
ful ladder between heaven and earth than that seen by Jacob— 
not a one-sided ladder leading in one direction, but an all- 
sided one, leading in all directions.” And that system of edu- 
cation is best, which develops the youth in all directions, thus 
forming a well rounded character leaving specialization to his 
later years. And that education is poor which trains and de- 
velops only a part of a child. 
Thus industrial education though extremely practical in its 
general aim, becomes an asthetic agent in the child’s educa- 
tion since it endeavors to instruct, to develop and to train. It 
teaches observation, and, through observation, reverence for the 
beautiful world of nature, the handwork of God, from whom 
alone cometh every good and perfect gift.

COUNTY SUPERVISION IN SOUTHEAST MISSOURI— 
ITS IMPORTANCE AND ITS POSSIBILITIES. 
MRS. CLARA EDWARDS GRAHAM. 
Superintendent, Mississippi County, Missouri. 
THaT county supervision has been a long felt need in our 
State, all who are familiar with the conditions will testify. 
But, because of peculiar local conditions in Southeast Mis- 
souri, the importance of it has been greater there, perhaps, 
than in any other part of the country. There we are con- 
fronted with problems unknown in other sections—the divided 
term and the irregular times for beginning the school term. 
The divided term exists for two reasons: The boys must 
help on the farm, or the roads in the bottom lands become im- 
passable. In either case the school will begin in the spring or
-P-A-G-E-61

early summer months, run for two or three or four months. If 
cotton picking is the excuse for dividing the term, the school 
will resume after the crop is saved; if the bad roads is the ex- 
cuse, the vacation will be shorter, usually not more than two 
or three weeks, but these short vacations are often used by the 
uninterested, itinerate teacher, to advantage. He persuades 
the school board to begin at such time, as will complete three 
or four months of school by the middle of August. Then he 
goes away “for a much-needed rest,” and writes back that he 
will be unable to finish the school. He has secured (perhaps 
months before) another school whose term begins in Septem- 
ber. The school he left must find another teacher if they can. 
There is not quite so much to fear from these interlopers where 
the term is divided, so that the boys may work in the fields, 
for in such districts the term opens somewhat later, seldom 
ever before the middle of July. Then by the time cotton pick- 
ing comes all other schools are in progress. 
Thanks to our wise legislators, we have some good laws now 
which will protect these unfortunate schools. Here the work 
of the Superintendent may count. By vigilance and helpful 
suggestions good may be accomplished. 
In our county we have classified the schools into two groups, 
the one group running regularly and beginning in September; 
the other group beginning their sessions in May, and running 
without intermission, if possible for eight months. 
The outlook is hopeful; the possibilities are great. 
In my round of visiting this fall I have surveyed a vast ter- 
ritory of fertile lands. I have driven for miles along the shore 
of the Father-of-Waters, and have observed how man, by his 
ingenunity and industry, has restrained this mighty power with 
vast levees or embankments of earth. I have traveled through 
forests primeval in their tangled and unkept condition. 
I have driven over some fine roads and some not so good, 
past splendid farms whose broad acreage pours each year into 
the lap of the farmer a rich harvest of fruit and grain. 
I have breathed into my nostrils.some of the finest dust that 
ever outsailed a flying machine, and have carried upon my 
buggy wheels and upon my feet some of the stickiest mud that 
ever stuck; and having surveyed for the first time this great 
county, and measured its wealth and its possibilities, I am

happy in the visions that come to me daily, and out of these 
day dreams I trust may come ere long the creature animate— 
a system of education that shall be inferior to none. 
I have visions of a time when farms have grown smaller and 
school houses have multiplied; when all submerged lands have 
been reclaimed and yield generously to the touch of industry; 
when every farmer owns his quarter section, his eighty or forty 
acres of land and living upon it, and tilling the soil with his 
own hands, helps to make the ideal rural community. 
I see a time when every boy and every girl of school age is 
attending school] for the entire school year; when the school 
sentiment is so great that it will be a reproach to that man 
who does not provide for the highest development of his child.

COLLEGE FRATERNITIES FROM THE INSTITUTION’S 
POINT OF VIEW. 
PRESIDENT FELL. 
President Fell, of St. John’s College, Annapolis, Maryland, 
delivered an address on the above subject. After giving a 
brief and concise review of the growth and history of college 
fraternities, and their early relations to the institutions to 
which they belonged, he took up the question confronting all 
universities and colleges to-day, and said: 
About twenty-five years ago the Greek letter fraternities 
passed into the present stage of their development, and their 
position in the college life is now recognized and powerful. 
They have met a much-needed want by providing houses and 
home life for the young student who enters a college com- 
munity without knowledge of the changed conditions under 
which he will be expected to conduct himself. 
By the growth of the State universities housing of the stu- 
dents, the necessity for keeping alive their social instincts and 
for the development of their moral character became ap- 
parent. 
The fraternities then stepped in and supplied houses and 
homes, but, in many cases, did not realize that home-building 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 63 
was not home-making, and neglected to provide a suitable form 
of government or oversight. 
Hence arose certain evils which have caused unfavorable 
comment, and which thoughtful members of the fraternity 
body generally admit as existing, and desire to have remedied. 
These may be briefly summarized as follows: 
First—Failure to maintain the ideal of high scholarship. 
Second—The introduction of license in the observance of so- 
cial fellowship. 
Third—The establishment of combinations and cliques, 
which is contrary to the fundamental principles of a true de- 
mocracy. 
These evils may be eradicated if young people have wise 
guidance, and a disposition is already manifested on the part 
of graduate members and also by members of the college facul- 
ties to interest themselves in the matter. 
But no permanent good can be obtained unless the faculty 
does more than merely come in contact with the student body. 
They should feel a personal interest in a student’s welfare, and, 
unless a portion, at least, of the faculty touch the student in 
a confidential relation, the influence of the fraternity may not 
be exercised for his best interests. 
Every effort, therefore, should be made by the authorities 
not only to recognize the elemental instincts of students as 
they tend to form these associations, but should coéperate 
with them, so that they may become, in reality, a part of or- 
ganized friendship for the social betterment and general im- 
provement of its members. 
In conclusion, he said: Viewed in this light the fraterni- 
ties must be recognized by the institution as a powerful factor 
in the cause of education, capable of promoting its best inter- 
ests and of supplying an interest which the college itself is sur- 
rendering, for the protection and comfort of young men at the 
formative period of life.

DOES THE CURRICULUM OF THE ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOLS MEET EXISTING NEEDS. 
SUPT. R. J. TIGHE, ASHEVILLE, N. C. 
Tue answer to this question will vary evidently in different 
communities. In some ‘places the people are demanding 
changes and in others they seem satisfied. The same is true 
of the teachers. We hear demands both for enrichment and 
curtailment. We have a course covering nine years in some 
New England towns and seven years in many of those in the 
South. These are the extremes. The average course covers 
eight years. There jis a tendency at present to reduce the 
course from nine to eight years and to add industrial and voca- 
tional training during the last two years. In industrial com- 
munities there is an evident state of unrest caused by what is 
termed the unmitableness of the curriculum for persons who 
expect to enter industrial pursuits. Hence the introduction of 
vocational training. 
The present curriculum has grown from the three R.’s a 
century ago into what we have at present. This growth is the 
result of changes in our civilization—scientific, industrial and 
sociological. And working through these causes we had had 
at the same time the pedagogical influence started by Rons- 
seau, Pestalozzi, Herbart and Froebel. What new social con- 
ditions have demanded, new educational conditions have sought 
to supply. 
Nevertheless, I do not think that the present elementary 
curriculum is suitable for the child of the twentieth century. 
I believe that too much time is being spent on the formal sub- 
jects and much time is being wasted through inefficient teach- 
ers. Herein lie the causes for so much waste in education. It 
is not strange that so many drop out of school before the ele- 
mentary course is completed. A large part of the retardation 
in classes, loss of efficiency, and early dropping out is due to 
poorly constructed curriculums, but a large part is due to in- 
effective teaching of the subjects now in the courses. We need 
more and better training schools for teachers, higher profes-
-P-A-G-E-65
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 65 
sional requirements, especially in the rural schools, and 
salaries that will induce the best men and women to enter the 
work. 
In addition to the formal subjects of reading, writing, draw- 
ing, arithmetic and composition we have history, geography, 
nature, and hygiene, vocal music, physical training, manual 
training, and domestic arts. In the rural schools we have 
added agriculture, and some cities vocational training. 
This course seems to cover the field well enough, but all the 
communities do not offer all of these opportunities. In fact, in 
most places little is offered outside the formal subjects except 
history, geography and physiology, and these poorly taught. 
The reading course should, and often does, offer exceptional 
opportunities for the study of good literature. Our history 
courses in the hands of good teachers open up a new field for 
thought and pave the way for good citizenship. Modern geog- 
raphy in the better schools supplements the history course and 
leads to a study of social and economic needs. A proper study 
of nature should form the beginning of science study and 
should acquaint the child with reasons for the more common 
natural phenomena as well as a broader sympathy for the life 
out-of-doors. 
Physical training and hygiene are beginning to revolutionize 
our health conditions by giving the child an insight into 
causes and effects of habits of life and environment. This 
work is being supplemented by the domestic arts where taught, 
and music and art add to the enjoyment of life. In the various 
phases of industrial education lately introduced into the cur- 
riculum we have the attempt made to make education more 
practical, to fit the child not only to apply his knowledge to 
things, but also to prepare those who do not expect to go be- 
yond the elementary course. Just how far this latter phase 
of the problem can be carried is still a question. So my an- 
swer to the question proposed is that the most modern ele- 
mentatry courses are adequate for existing conditions, but they 
are not yet general enough and our teachers are not prepared 
sufficiently to get the best results from the curriculum now in 
use.

DISCIPLINARY EDUCATION. 
R. H. CROSSFIELD, PH. D. 
President Transylvania University. 
In no country is education so universally sought and valued 
as in America. So pronounced is the sentiment of our people 
in this regard that, should anyone endeavor to minimize or to 
belittle the importance of education, he would find his detrac- 
tions resisted at every point. The lettered and the unlettered, 
the rich and the poor, the home-born and the foreigner, the 
urban and the rural resident, through platform, pulpit and 
pass, all join to sing the coronation hymn of education. Next 
to the acquisition of wealth, it is our national passion, and 
some one has asked, with more seriousness than humor, “Are 
we educationally mad?” 
This deepending and widening sentiment emerges in the 
form of increased tax levies in State, county, and municipality 
for elementary, secondary, collegiate, and university educa- 
tion. What is more, private wealth is being poured into equip- 
ment for enlargement and efficiency, the amount of which an- 
nually reaches into the ninth figure. 
It shall be the purpose of this paper to inquire into the type 
of higher education we are endeavoring to give to the youth of 
America. What are the ideals of those who are attracted to 
these institutions? What is the finished product? 
A questionaire submitted recently by the writer to a body of 
undergraduates developed the fact that they came to college for 
the following reasons: association, athletics, other out-of- 
class interests, training prerequisite to professional studies, 
and fundamental training necessary to prepare “for the occa- 
sions and uses of life.” I take it that the student body of this 
college is typical, and that these are the reasons underlying 
the attendance of the vast majority of those who register in 
our American colleges. 
The student who attends college for the association it af- 
fords is an ever-present and consequential factor. He con- 
siders the course of study rather a convenience to keep the fel-
-P-A-G-E-67
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 67 
lows together. Comradeship, rubbing against college walls, 
inhaling the atmosphere of the place, are fundamental in the 
thought of such a student. He sometimes asks with all serious- 
ness, “Ought a college student to study? Should one’s studies 
be allowed to interfere with one’s education ?” 
It will not be disputed by even the most limited experience or 
‘the most casual observation that such association and sentiment 
contribute a substantial increment to manliness, to culture, to 
esprit de corps to the give-and-take principle of life. Persistent 
friendships are thereby formed, and liberalizing forces started 
which perceptibly influence the student’s attitude toward the 
various and varying phases of life. He catches a spirit of team 
work. His harsh, blunt, assertory voice is modified into the 
problematical tone. Self-reliance of a better type is developed. 
All these and many other advantages are to be derived from 
the college quadrennium, but, after all, does not the student who 
comes to college primarily for association pay too dearly for 
what he gets? Measured in terms of years and months and 
days, the disparity between the price and the product is signifi- 
cant, but measured by the supreme importance of the storm 
and stress period devoted to college life—the high tide for 
preparation which rises but once, the one opportunity to de- 
velop “the ideal attributes that exist in potentia in the human 
spirit”—the cost cannot be computed. For what does it profit 
a young man if he gain the whole world of form and conven- 
tionality, and become a flabby flank in society? or, what can he 
give in-exchange for the solidifying and crystallizing prepara- 
tion that comes only through earnest study and application to 
academic subjects? 
Another by-product—or, as some one has chosen to call it, a 
side show taking the place of the main tent—that is sometimes 
elevated into the major place of consideration is athletics. 
Much is to be said to the credit of college athletics. They 
serve a valuable purpose in academic life, and, by almost unani- 
mous consent, will be continued. They infuse a wholesome 
spirit into both the physical and mental life of the student. 
Morbidity is prevented ; priggishness is tabooed. Athletics serve 
to keep the young man sexually clean, and afford an outlet for 
physical energy which might otherwise find vent in dissipation 
and mischief. They also cultivate the manly virtues of self- 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
restraint, fair play, courtesy, generosity, courage, obedience, and 
decision of character. : 
All said, however, in favor of improved conditions in student 
life resulting in a measure from college athletics, it remains a 
fact that in the lives of an increasingly large number of stu- 
dents, athletics stand for far too much. 
I would not be understood as laying the entire blame for the 
disproportionate importance attached to these sports on the 
student. Some one connected with a leading American college 
has come out into the open long enough to suggest, with scarcely 
less truth than irony, that, “after all, the American college is no 
Jonger ap educational institution, but a huge gymnasium.” This 
facetious remark was evoked, not by the glaring headlines of 
the daily press, giving hardly less space and prominence to the 
Thanksgiving game than to the “Ascot race,” or the latest pro- 
fessional pugilistic mill, nor yet by the bizarre bleachers and 
the explosive underclassmen, but by the attitude of college 
authorities themselves. Whatever may be printed in catalogues, 
circulars, bulletins, and the like, the real advertisement of an 
appreciable number of institutions of higher learning would 
lead one to believe that their athletic equipment, standing, and 
supremacy constituted their all-sufficient raison detre. Not 
only do the athletic director and the coach of the football team 
frequently receive larger salaries than the best-paid professor 
in the institution, and their fame exceed that of the ripest 
scholar, but the student athlete is heralded as the hero of the 
hour by the college itself. 
Without any effort at all to criticise clean, sane athletics, the 
question is up for determination: Are not our student bodies 
unduly interested in that which, properly administered, should 
be a relish and a secondary consideration? 
The student who comes to college primarily because of the 
opportunities afforded in athletics, or who, after matriculation, 
becomes so engrossed as to fall into negligent habits of study, 
fails utterly in that for which the college was established, and 
the ideals for which it should be maintained. 
Other students go to college because of fraternity life, the 
college press, dramatic clubs, musical organizations, and the 
like. These out-of-class interests have value in proportion as 
they furnish profitable occupation for the free time of the stu-
-P-A-G-E-69
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 69 
dent. The unfortunate thing about the whole matter is that 
the primary purpose of attending college, namely, the develop- 
ment of the mind for efficiency, and the real process by which 
this is accomplished, namely, contact of the student with his 
studies through the personality of some great-souled teacher, 
are obscured. This is as if one should go into ecstacies over a 
star of the fiftieth magnitude, and fail to see Venus standing 
out conspicuously in the field of night. It is leaving the main 
road to follow a by-path. It is penny-wise and pound foolish. 
It is the blind man feeling but one part of the elephant, and 
failing to perceive the co-ordinated whole. 
I have tried to say with emphasis that the function of the 
college is not primarily to afford a place for association and 
sentiment; not to develop the athlete, nor to furnish such games 
as will attract the lovers of sport; nor yet to train men through 
out-of-class enterprises. Now I come to say that it is not the 
function of the college to furnish industrial and professional 
training—training in agriculture, the arts, crafts, trades, and 
the learned professions. 
It would seem that the “bread and butter” side of education 
is in this day of materialism receiving the supreme emphasis. 
It is the fad of our present-day training. The short cut to pros- 
perity, the hurry-up method in money-making, the rapid transit 
to financial success, hold a prominent place in our educational 
programme. That education which may be had in the shortest 
time and for the least money, which will make the student a 
producer of wealth, is extravagantly popular. The American 
student wants to be moulded into a first-class engineer, lawyer, 
or doctor, and the moulding must be done “while you wait.” 
The old-fashioned way of first training in disciplinary subjects 
and then specializing in industrial and professional studies 
would by many be relegated to the limbo of old fogyism; conse- 
quently, a long and loud protest has gone up against formal 
training. The result is high school graduates are going around 
the college into schools of applied science and into professional 
schools, and many who receive superior technical training fail 
of attaining the highest results because of deficiences in all 
around culture. 
This method is like sowing the field without first upturning 
and thoroughly preparing the soil; like building the house with-
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
out laying a careful foundation; like attempting to win a race 
without the severe training necessary to the development of 
muscle and endurance. 
What America most needs today is not so much men trained 
in one branch of learning, but men trained to think. The funda- 
mental purpose of undergraduate study is to train the mind to 
think clearly and consecutively ; to correlate facts so as to con- 
ceive new ideas and to reach unquestioned conclusions; to inter- 
pret and digest evidence; to systematically and carefully win- 
now reasoning; to put aside personality, party, and even pa- 
triotism, and to see things from a non-partisan point of view; to 
develop the spirit of fellowship and interest in all things 
human; and to know how to deal with men on the broad basis 
of mutual and universal welfare. This is the province of the 
college. 
Such training is highly desirable whether the student selects 
as his life work a vocational or a professional pursuit. Facts, 
it is true, have their important place, but at best they are but 
tools with which the educated man serves his country, succeeds 
in business or profession, and contributes to the welfare of 
society. 
This sort of training, however, is difficult. In the first place, 
the great mass of our American people still estimate the value 
of an education by means of the dollar mark. So much money 
spent per annum on a boy in college for four years will produce 
so much money in earned results. What will it cost? What 
will it come to? 
This materialistic view of education was scorned by the 
wisest of the sages. Plato contended that “practical arts are 
degrading,” and, while Aristotle taught that citizenship was the 
object to be attained by education, he vigorously insisted that 
“to be always in quest of what is useful is not becoming to a 
highminded man and freeman.” Then ethical and patriotic 
values held the primacy. Today comparatively little emphasis 
is put upon the contribution the educated man is enabled to 
make to civil society, the joys growing out of his attainments, 
and the philanthropic offices he is enabled to perform. Such 
disciplinary training does not qualify a man to take at once a 
position in a bank, to enter the government service, to conduct 
a mercantile business, to produce eighty bushels of corn to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. Th 
acre, or to operate a mine, and is, therefore, not generally so 
highly considered. 
In the second place, the teaching of knowledge is more agree- 
able to the feelings of the student than the teaching of power. 
The one pre-eminent characteristic of childhood is the desire 
to know things. We call it curiosity. There is a rare pleas- 
ure connected with the discovery of the uses and designs of 
things. So when the student is offered facts, which to him were 
hitherto unknown, there is a pleasurable and spontaneous re- 
sponse. On the other hand, the teaching of power, the enlarging 
of the brain areas, causes mental fatigue. Illustrations charm 
us; principles are irksome. The one is the bird in the hand, the 
other is the bird in the bush. No wonder, then, we prefer erudi- 
tion to power, an increase in knowledge rather than the train- 
ing of the mind to think. 
The mastery of a foreign tongue well illustrates the true edu- 
cational process. Much time is necessarily devoted at first to 
rules, principles, forms, exceptions, idioms, conjugations, 
declensions—the real drudgery of study. But unless these are 
mastered at the very beginning, the probabilities are that the 
student will never become proficient in the language. To 
plunge into the Agricola or Germania without first thoroughly 
grounding one’s self in the principles of Latin grammar would 
be to violate every law of sound pedagogy. 
The same principle obtains in athletic sports. The successful 
foothal] coach teaches his squad first of all the fundamentals of” 
the zame—catching the ball, holding it properly, running, punt- 
ing, tackling, etc. These elements enter into all successful prac- 
tice. They are the difficult and less interesting features of train- 
ing, and from them the student very naturally withdraws, but 
so indispensable is skill in these things to ultimate success that 
the coach continues practice on these points to within a few 
days of the contest. Then, the fundamentals well mastered, the 
details are taught in the last stage of training—the formations, 
the signals, the trick plays, and the like. 
To become a producer is only one phase of the educational 
process and should be reserved to the last. With a well-dis- 
ciplined mind, trained to think accurately, quickly, logically, 
and ready to do one’s bidding, industrial and professional sub- 
jects are easily acquired.

There is another purpose of fundamental training which is 
not often emphasized, viz., the enabling of one to become an 
intelligent consumer. Schools exisit everywhere for the purpose 
of developing skill in producing, but where is a man to be taught 
how wisely to expend his accumulated means? This prepara- 
tion involves an investigation of the whole realm of relations, 
which is possible only to the disciplined mind. 
The coal miner should know how to release the mineral from 
its measures in the most advantageous manner, for skill at this 
point will enable him to earn sufficient wages for support. But 
he should also have a knowledge of the laws of commerce, as 
the value of his work depends not solely upon his efforts, but 
upon the manner in which his product is conveyed to the con- 
sumer. The planter of the South should be intelligently inter- 
ested not only in those processes by which he may secure the 
largest yield for the labor expended, but also in all evolutions 
through which a given product passes before it returns to him 
ready for consumption. For the same reason, the wool grower 
should understand and defend the principles of equitable reward 
to each man who has to do with producing the finished product. 
It often occurs that the tobacco grower in Kentucky (some- 
times led into the lawlessness of night-riding because the Trust 
refuses to purchase his tobacco at a price which he thinks fair), 
buys without complaint the same article when manufactured at 
an outrageously exorbitant price. After all, the producer is a 
member of a complex system in which his production is only one 
element. Only that fundamental training in subjects that give 
the student a wider horizon, larger powers of discrimination, 
and better judgment in determining points involved in any 
given transaction, will enable him wisely to use what he has 
already brought forth. Making and spending go hand in hand 
in our economic system, and preparation should be made for the 
one as well as the other. 
It should be noted also that education in knowledge looks 
rather to work than to leisure. One-third of each normal day is 
spent in leisure. How is this to be employed so as to yield the 
greatest profit? If one’s education has been so directed as to 
produce power, the problem is easy of solution. If a man can 
think, he is always in good company, and he may be “least alone 
when alone.” As he wanders through field, wood, the centers of 
 
-P-A-G-E-73

population, or peruses the pages cogent with the thought of the 
noblest and best of earth, or communes as soul with soul, his 
powers of observation, discrimination and fellowship are a 
source of constant delight. 
I am not here taking account of the vacation season. This is 
not to be spent in idleness, for doing nothing does not relieve 
the strain of an overworked head and hand. One must be able 
to enjoy art, music, books, friends, and travel, if the vacation is 
to result in the greatest good. Such preparation comes through 
training in the broadest sense. 
In disciplinary education, I assume that different subjects 
have different values. President Baker, of the Committee of 
Ten, says: “If rightly understood, the majority of the commit- 
tee rejected the theory of equivalence for general education.” 
Yet, the gospel of equivalence is preached with increasing ve- 
hemence and is made to apply to all departments of education. 
Trades and crafts are being introduced into elementary schools 
as having equal educational value with the time-honored three 
R.’s. The high school, it is contended by many, should offer 
such courses as will prepare the student, first of all, for a gain- 
ful trade, or serve as an introduction to professional life. 
For all practical purposes, the doctrine of equivalence holds 
good in the great trunk lines of education. It would be unwis- 
dom to debate the relative value of Latin, Greek, mathematics, 
philosophy, pure science, and history in disciplinary education, 
all of these subjects developing the memory, the imagination, 
the power of observation, and requiring correlation of facts. 
In mathematics, there is a combination of memory, observa- 
tion and reason, and this science is at once the foundation of 
logic and philosophy. Such a subject is, therefore, an indis- 
pensable tool of an active mind. It gives insight into the ma- 
terial universe, and is broad and practical in its operations. 
Daniel Webster said that he reviewed his plane and solid geome-. 
try every year in order to strengthen his mind in the processes 
of logic. 
The study of the Latin language is of especial value. Along 
with its refining influences, and its cultivation of exactness of 
thought, it is an open door to the institutions, thoughts, and 
feelings of one of the four great nations of the earth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
It also furnishes the root of that part of our vocabulary which 
is especially the language of thought and reflection. The Teu- 
tonic groundwork of the English language yields the vocabulary 
of every-day life and experience communicated through the 
senses. The Latin foundation furnishes our great principles 
and systems of thought. It affords an introduction to the litera- 
ture of power. It gives us the forms of civil and municipal life. 
In these particulars, the institutions of our complex modern 
civilization are essentially Roman. a 
Nor does it suffice to study the literature of a great language 
in the translated form. To get the real content, the spiritual 
aspiration, thought, and experience of the people, the original 
must be mastered. Failing in this, its disciplinary value is in a 
measure sacrificed. 
The Greek is a language of culture and its study is valuable 
in the highest degree as a mental discipline. It requires closest 
observation, discrimination, and deduction. Moreover, our 
aesthetic forms and scientific terms go beyond Rome to Greece 
for their origin. As in jurisprudence, we speak the language of 
the Czesars, in science and art, we speak the language of Plato 
and Phidias. Just as from the Roman colonies were born great 
modern states, whose civil institutions have been nurtured 
under her code, so from the Greek speaking peoples, art, science, 
and culture have evolved. 
Modern languages do not stand in the same relation to culture 
and discipline as do these ancient tongues. The reason is not 
far to see. All these—French, German, Italian, Spanish, ete.— 
presuppose original sources; just as the English language. Not 
so with the Greek and the Latin. They stand in the relation of 
ihe embryo to modern developments in language. Their litera- 
ture, art, ethics, science, philosophy, revealing the highest fornt 
of human freedom, influenced, it is true, in many ways by Egyp- 
tian, Babylonian, Chaldean, and Assyrian forces, posssess an 
original stamp found not elsewhere, and speak not loudly of 
antecedent civilizations. 
Free electives, it seems to me, have militated in a pronounced 
way against disciplinary education. It is a matter of general 
agreement that the courses of study offered by our colleges today 
are infinitely superior to those of fifty years ago. We would 
not return to the practice of cast-iron uniformity. The elective 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 15 
system is a long stride in the direction of better results in train- 
ing, and, therefore, has come to stay. 
The thing about which much complaint is made is that in the 
failure to properly administer the elective system, it has ceased 
to be a system, and has reached the crazy-quilt condition. To 
suppose that the three R.’s constitute a complete curriculum for 
education is hardly less erroneous than that the average under- 
graduate is able to make his ways with dispatch and profit 
through the mazes and jungles of the free electives offered by 
many institutions. Free election has gone to seed. The temp- 
tation to make the college course a summer vacation rather 
than the hard work of term time is altogether too pronounced. 
Instead of thought-provoking Greek and Latin, the student may 
choose archeology and literature; and in the place of fundamen- 
tal history and pure science, he is tempted to elect modern an- 
nals and applied science. 
It only remains for one word to be said on the subject of dis- 
ciplinary education as it relates to the teacher. The courses of 
study may be entirely satisfactory, flexible, yet disciplinary, but 
without the proper personality as a means of making the cor- 
rect impression upon growing life, the purpose of education will 
be but feebly accomplished. 
Philip of Macedon rejoiced not only that he had a son, but 
that this boy was born in the time of Aristotle, the great 
teacher. We have heartily laughed over the statement that 
Mark Hopkins and a student on a log constitute a university ; 
and yet the vital truth remains as salient today as ever before, 
that no matter how carefully the course of study be planned, 
unless the student is brought into contact with a teacher who 
has a great mind, a great heart, and a great soul, he will not 
come out of a college an educated man. As good English cannot 
be attained wholly by the study of texts and literature, but 
must come through association with those who have it, so the 
student will be taught to think, to reason properly, to exercise 
imagination, to be constructive, very largely as the result of 
coming in contact with such a mind in the instructor. 
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Our colleges 
need to emphasize those studies and processes that will prepare 
trained minds, and place in charge of these courses the highest 
types of scholarship and manhood.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
EXTENSION PLAN FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
JAMES H. DILLARD. 
President Jeanes Fund. 
Tue idea which I have to present for extension work among 
the schools in the open country can be stated very briefly. The 
idea came from two actual experiments, which were made in 
connection with the work of the Jeanes Fund. The Superin- 
tendent of a county in Virginia asked for the salary of a com- 
petent supervising teacher, who would introduce simple forms 
of industrial work into the twenty-two negro rural schools of 
the county, and would give her time to supervising this work. 
In a county in Mississippi an industrial teacher in a central 
school asked permission to extend this industrial work into four 
small rural schools that were within a distance of five or six 
miles of the school used as headquarters. There is abundant 
testimony that these experiments have worked out well, and 
they contain the idea which I believe can be used in such a way 
as to promote very greatly the improvement and efficiency of the 
small rural schools of a county. 
Cities and towns make use of the plan of having teachers of 
drawing, teachers of sewing, teachers of music, pass from school 
to school. Why should not the same plan be adopted for rural 
schools? Tt is easier and less expensive to take a teacher to the 
pupils than to bring the pupils to the teacher. The consolida- 
tion of rural schools is a great and important movement, but 
even the consolidated schools may need special teachers, and 
there will always remain smaller schools within walking dis- 
tance of the children of a community. 
Extension or supervising teachers might be used for any 
special branch. It seems to me that the great need today is for 
teachers who can introduce manual training and industrial 
work, can show the local teachers how to conduct the work, and 
can supervise it after it is introduced. The testimony is that 
children like such work, and that it actually tends to improve 
the character of the book work. 
The improvement of the rural schools is a tremendously press- 
ing problem. The Farmers’ National Congress, which recently   
-P-A-G-E-77
ee ee 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 17 
held its annual session at Raleigh, was quite right in demanding 
an equal chance for country boys and girls at school with city 
children. We are just beginning to find out that rural educa- 
tion has been neglected, and that for the general improvement 
of rural life, about which so much is now being written, the 
basic need will be the reorganization and betterment of rural 
schools. It is upon this that the States must put the educa- 
tional emphasis for the next twenty-five years. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
A FEW FUNDAMENTAL QUALIFICATIONS OF THE 
COUNTY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 
SUPT. CHAS. F. TRUDEAU, NEW ROADS, LA. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Having in mind the many brilliant and able discussions, which 
have been presented already to educational associations of either 
State or national character, discussions not only of all the 
phases of the topic which I am to discuss before you today, but 
as well phases of all other educational questions worthy of dis- 
cussion before this or any other educational association, I am 
better prepared to realize the situation of the young but am- 
bitious astronomer just out of school, having in his possession 
only the ordinary high school telescopes, as he attempts to 
explore some spot in the beautiful heavenly dome, hoping to dis- 
cover there some star which heretofore had escaped the skillful 
and experienced eye of the older astronomer, peering for years 
without number, through the great Lick telescope, turned upon 
the self same spot. However, as it is generally conceded to be 
good pedagogical doctrine now and then to emphasize principles 
already taught by means of periodical reviews, therefore, should 
I not go beyond the limits previously surveyed, nor plunge to 
greater depths than those who have preceded me, and if, alas, I 
but restate some facts previously and more learnedly discussed 
by others, I shall plead the wisdom of the law of “Friday after- 
noon reviews” in justification of my efforts. : | 
Even they who have had but a faint insight into the varied 
and innumerable duties of the twentieth century County School
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  78 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Superintendent, and, more especially, they who through their 
experience have reached that vantage point in educational work 
whence they may look back and see the intelligent and pro- 
gressive Superintendent in relation to his duties, his responsi- 
bilities and varied tasks, they, we say, at once recognize the im- 
portance; nay, the necessity, of the following fundamental quali- 
fications in the present day County School Superintendent. 
First of all, a broad, rich and liberal scholarship is as indis- 
pensable to a County School Superintendent as is his very life 
blood to his existence. The very nature of his work requires 
scholarship that it may grow. The raison d’etre of his position 
is grounded on scholarship. Nor would it be proper to mention 
this elementary fact here were it not that in reading statutory 
provisions, enacted only a few years back, and defining the quali- 
fications of that officer, we find in too many instances no legis- 
lative effort made to emphasize the fact that no man should be 
appointed or elected to this office unless he possess, first, a 
liberal measure of scholarship. For, my fellow-teachers, is not 
this officer expected in the nature of his work to prepare courses 
of study for pupils ranging from primary grades on up through 
the grades of the high schools? Is it not a part of his duty to 
pass upon the qualifications of teachers before they are ap- 
pointed to teach? Is it not his duty to superintend and criticise 
the work of teachers in the classroom? Is it not his duty to lead 
in the institute work in his county, to keep informed on, and to 
discuss intelligently at the proper time, all educational move- 
ments whether of a county, State, national, or world-wide char- 
acter? Is he not expected to bring to all with whom he comes 
in contact that influence which inspires respect, confidence, and 
love; that influence which makes for nobler things in the world; 
that influence which is born of scholarship? Hear, please, the 
words of Supt. J. W. Olsen: “The County Superintendent must 
have learned that he cannot give save from his own supply; he 
cannot arouse intellectual ambition, nor kindle the spirit 
of social service unless he have the love of knowledge and of 
humanity strong within him. Only life begets life. He should 
know that only by superior qualities of head and heart can he 
inspire his teachers and officers with that confidence in him 
which will result in cheerful following of his lead towards the 
larger education.” And this, fellow-teachers, now brings us to
-P-A-G-E-79
eT ee 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 19 
the consideration of another fundamental qualification of the 
Superintendent. I mean that priceless jewel, that precious 
something, called character. 
| This, which admits its possessor into the company of refined 
and intellectual people when nothing else will, is, above all, to be 
be sought after, and, when earned, jealously guarded by him who 
is intrusted with the responsibilities attaching to the Superin- 
tendent’s office. In the first place, as a teacher of teachers, the 
Superintendent’s character should be spotless; for otherwise, 
not only would he fail in his leadership (and thus wreck his 
life and waste his ambition), but his influence upon the lives 
of those for whom he could do so much, and to whom he could 
bring such warmth of love, sympathy and hope, might, instead, 
be a poison in the water they drink, or the venom of the adder 
injected into their blood. The Superintendent should stand for 
the best in everything. His banner should always be unfurled 
on the side of righteousness. His life should be such that it will 
admit of no question, and as soon as the man himself is known 
to the community in which he lives and works, there should be, 
on the part of no one, further doubt as to his motives. On the 
other hand, his life, his habits, his manner of thinking, in fact, 
all about him, should be an open book, and should at once recom- 
mend him to the confidence and esteem of his community. And, 
while it may be desirable that he keep aloof from local animosi- 
ties and neighborhood strife, yet, his fairness of mind, the purity 
of his motives, and his manly sincerity should recommend him 
as a competent and desirable judge in the settlement of all con- 
flicts growing out of, and indiginous to, selfish interest in every 
school community. It is well for him that he have the wisdom 
of the serpent, and the harmlessness of the dove; but, that with- 
out which he cannot succeed in his work as a school officer, is a 
clean, manly noble character. 
Of no less importance, however, to the success of the County 
Superintendent than the qualifications above mentioned are 
those of energy and business sense. The nature of his work, the 
very situation in which he finds himself, his multiplicity of 
duties and their varied character, and the people with whom he 
has to deal, demand that he have much of both. Think for a 
moment of the extensiveness of his correspondence, and of the 
nature of this correspondence. Think of his duties as treasurer  
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of school funds (in those States where he is also treasurer of 
those funds), of the accounts which he must keep with the tax 
collector, the banks, the teachers, the Assessor, the State Treas- 
urer, and the school-book and furniture supply house; think of 
the record he must keep of school statistics, of the reports he 
must furnish the State Superintendent of Education, monthly, 
quarterly, and annually, and at any other time called upon to 
furnish same; think of his work in examining teachers and 
advising them in their work; think of the time and labor 
demanded of him in planning and carrying out the parish insti- 
tute work, in visiting several times, annually, all the schools of 
his parish, in making special visits to adjust local school differ- 
ences (when adjustable, and, when not, oh my!), or to assist the 
teacher in some particular work; think of the demand made 
upon his time and energy in planning and conducting a cam- 
paign for a special school tax, in planning a new school house, in 
supervising the construction of that school house; think of his 
work in preparing for, and taking part in, conferences called by 
the State Superintendent, from time to time; think of the time 
and energy necessary that the Superintendent may promote his 
own growth, his own intellectual and professional advancement ; 
then look upon the hundred of other demands made upon his 
time and store of energy by the many perplexing conditions 
incident to this twentieth century school development and join 
me in saying that the Parish Superintendent, beyond the shadow 
of a doubt, and, par excellence, should be, must be, a man of 
conspicuous business sense and a man of undaunted energy. 
Fellow-teachers, if the people of the different counties of the 
South will hold the County Superintendent responsible for the 
full performance of his every task, and the conscientious dis- 
charge of his every duty, no officer will earn more fully every 
dollar that is paid him for his services, no person lead a more 
active, verile and fruitful life of social service than will the 
County Superintendent of Education. The knowledge on the 
part of the people of what a Superintendent should do, and 
their desire that these things be done constitute a law suf- 
ficiently rigid to determine the degree of success or failure of 
the County Superintendent. Now, fellow-teachers, regardless 
of the many other qualifications that a Superintendent might 
or might not have and make a success of his work, I wish to
-P-A-G-E-81
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 81 
mention just another which everyone concedes to be indis- 
pensable. And this is not only true in the business of the 
teacher; it is equally true in all other pursuits and avocations. 
It is the lack of this one quality which has led to many failures; 
it is the absence of this gift which has caused a cloud to hang 
over the lives of many men and which has brought disappoint- 
ment and bitter regrets into the lives of many men and women. 
In short, in estimating the teacher’s fitness for his work, I 
doubt if one could leave out of the consideration with any 
greater degree of safety this quality of adaptability to one’s 
environments than he could leave out of the consideration the 
character, scholarship, business sense, or the energy of the 
teacher, or of the County Superintendent. He it is who must be 
prepared at all times to meet both peasant and prince. He it is 
who must be ever ready to hold his own in the company of 
statesmen and scholars, and equally ready to speak of common- 
place things at the rustic, but usually hospitable, board of some 
illiterate friend. It is essential that he be as much at ease in the 
most elegant reception room of the most cultured and refined 
lady of the land where literature, music and the fine arts are the 
topics of conversation, as he must make himself, while standing 
on the headland between cotton rows with his trousers be- 
smeared with red clay mud and his coat sleeves testifying to a 
luxuriant crop of cuckle-burrs, while this County Superintend- 
ent is discussing with his sunburnt farmer friend the question 
of voting a special tax in that district, or yet the question: On 
which side of the schoolhouse shall be placed the hitch-post for 
the teacher’s horse? He must be as much at home in discussing 
school finances with the business man of his community as he is 
when discussing the value of commercial fertilizer with the pro- 
gressive farmer. He must at once discuss the question of school 
hygiene and sanitation with an expert school medical examiner, 
and the question of repairing the roof of the schoolhouse with 
a carpenter, or the question of drains with the janitor. He must 
be as skillful in advocating such entanglements in petty local 
political contests as would endanger the success of his work, as 
he must be patient in listening to the disconnected and often 
meaningless harangues of the well-meaning, but, alas, innocent 
fellow-countryman on one subject or another. He must derive 
as much pleasure (or feign with histrionic skill to so derive) 
6
-P-A-G-E-82
82 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
while partaking of the good old farmer’s coarse but ample meal, 
and such other inconveniences so well known to his host, as he 
would derive at a sumptuous banquet spread in honor of the 
Governor of North Carolina and served with the consummate 
skill of the Waldorf-Astoria, or, better still, that of the St. 
Charles Hotel. In fact, while not sacrificing any of his manly 
independence, nor forfeiting any of his personal preferences, 
nor in any way trifling with his manly sincerity, he must, in 
some sense, be all things to all men. This necessity grows out 
of the eccentricities of human nature. The poor illiterate has, 
by nature, small faith in, and less fellow-feeling for, the gloved 
hand aristocrat, regardless of the immensity and intensity of 
the love and kindly feeling of the latter for the former. This is 
of necessity so. Not that the philanthropist has not the right 
to be an aristocrat and dress as he pleases, but rather because 
the other, in his poverty and ignorance, feels unrelated to his 
more favored brother, and, more than that, feels an estrange- 
ment and alienation caused by the dissimilarity of conditions 
which underlie their respective stations in life. Hence, the 
necessity of the Parish Superintendent’s adjusting himself to 
things as he finds them. Not, indeed, that he continue to live 
in conformity to conditions as he finds them, but rather in order 
that he may more readily and more surely change them to con- 
form to his standard of what things should be, in a word, to his 
ideals. And, while a man possessing all the qualifications that 
that office requires, as above described, would naturally find 
greater congeniality with the more intellectual and refined por- 
tion of the community in which he lives, yet his love of duty, 
his desire to promote the welfare and happiness of the less 
favored majority, his pleasure in emulating as far as his hu- 
manity permits, the example of him who sought the lowly, the 
poor, the sick, in preference to the company of kings and other 
earthly potentates, in emulating his worthy example in placing 
aside the pleasures, the riches, the honors, the acclamations of 
the populace, and in choosing, instead, a life of self-sacrifice in 
the interest of humanity, that County Superintendent has the 
opportunity of pouring out in the interest of his fellowmen the 
chalice of his love and sympathy, as the greatest of teachers him- 
self poured forth his blood on Mount Calvary in expiation of 
the sins which pressed so heavily upon his great humanity of 
which he himself is the Savior.

IMPROVEMENTS MOST NEEDED IN THE KINDER- 
GARTEN COURSE OF STUDY AND IN 
DAILY PRACTICE. 
HENRIETTA M. ARMSTRONG, SPARROWS POINT, MD. 
Resolved: 
“To keep my health. 
To do my work. 
To live. 
To see to it I grow, and gain, and give. 
Never to look behind me for one hour.” 
If living means growth, then what shall we do in our line of 
education, the kindergarten, to keep alive, to grow? In the 
other departments of education we find great strides being made. 
To be sure the kindergarten principles are largely used, so that 
they are instrumental in revolutionizing elementary education, 
as well as the times. The kindergarten stands as an integral 
part of the great whole in this system of education, and we must 
present our ideas to the child in the same logical scientific way. 
We cannot draw our skirts and say we are kindergarteners, we 
do thus and so. The kindergarteners should realize that they 
belong to this great school system, and unless they build the 
sure foundation, no matter how much is done for the child later, 
there will be a consequent weakness that will never be over- 
come. Therefore I ask, are we carrying out our theories in a 
good, practical way? Everyone acknowledges our theories are 
sound, but they do criticize our practical work and they have 
every reason to do so. 
Carefully study the programmes which are given by some 
trainers. Are they always logical? Do not some of us forget 
that each lesson is connected and grows out of that which pre- 
cedes it? There is no isolation in this great universe, one thing 
depends upon and is related to something else—so we should not 
give isolated ideas to our children. Thus the student who has 
had kindergarten training should have a fundamental knowl- 
edge of the theories of kindergarten work, and how to apply 
them in a sound, practical way. They should realize the need
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to understand the child. Should have a desire to grow to live, 
and be endued with the true spirit of our great disciple, Froebel, 
which is the most important in the hurry and stress of today. 
Everyone would be the better man or woman, boy or girl, if he 
or she had some of the spirit of that master mind. 
To those of us who are working with the children, I would 
say, let us in working out our problems endeavor to make the 
children more self-reliant, capable of doing and obedient. 
Teach the children to live in harmony, first by living that way 
and then by having playthings which all must share. If they 
quarrel, and they occasionally do, try to have them understand 
that they must play harmoniously, they must share or no play. 
The codperative work, by using large materials to build 
houses, facorties, etc., on the floor, helps the child to realize he 
has to do his part as perfectly as he can, for on each part 
depends the whole. 
If we teach the children to be obedient, self-reliant, to do for 
themselves, to live in harmony and do their share of the work, 
and do it well, we are helping them to grow, and gain, and give. 
But they must get this knowledge in a logical, scientific way— 
as well as a beautiful spiritual one. 
As the practice work depends upon the course of study, let 
only those who can work out their theories in a logical, scientific 
way, and who have the spirit, undertake this noble calling.

H. BE. BENNETT, COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY, WILLIAMS- 
BURG, VA. 
An inquiry was recently sent to about seventy representative 
institutions engaged in training public school teachers. Replies 
were received from forty-seven, pretty evenly distributed 
through the country and representing universities, city training 
schools and public normals in about the same proportion as the 
whole number of such institutions. It is believed that the whole 
field is fairly represented.

The first question was, “Does your institution offer any dis- 
tinct courses on moral training?” Thirty-five answered “No;” 
six offer some form of ethics for this purpose, and six others 
treat the subject definitely under psychology, management or 
principles. Apparently none treat instruction in character- 
building as a separate study. 
The second question was, “Do you regard such courses as de- 
sirable?” Twenty-five answer definitely in the affirimative, nine 
as definitely in the negative. Of the doubtful remainder, four 
at least may be regarded as affirmative, subject to the organizing 
of a suitable content for such course. We may fairly say that 
the vote stands three to one in favor of specific courses in moral 
training, among those who have reached a conclusion upon the 
subject. 
The third question asked for (a) the ground covered by such 
courses or (b) the policy approved in lieu thereof. The replies 
were so varied, touch upon so many topics and show so little 
agreement, that a digest would consume practically all the time 
available here and reach no conclusion. The more frequent 
views are presented in the following discussion and all have been 
carefully considered in preparing it. The greatest difficulty 
arises through the common confusion of the problem before us, 
i. e., the specific preparation of teachers to build character, with 
two quite different ones; (a) the moral development of the pros- 
pective teachers themselves and (b) the formal moral instruc- 
tion of children. 
Though nearly every educational writer might be cited to the 
effect that the chief function of the school is to develop good 
moral character, a widely used modern text states that “under 
present conditions moral training must be a by-product of the 
schools.” Still, we believe that it will readily be agreed that the 
following points are practically settled. (a) The schools are 
responsible for the moral development of the child so far as it is 
within their power; (b) nearly every kind of school activity may 
have a moral significance; (c) moralizing and “preaching” may 
take the edge off the child’s moral consciousness, and (d) a sine 
qua non of character-building is the formation of right habits. 
The first point raises the question, just what is that moral char- 
acter for which the schools should aim? The next, by what test 
shall we know certainly that each school exercise does have its 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    86 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
due moral value? What part of the moral structure is con- 
tributed to by each kind of activity? How shall we know that 
these are balanced so as to round out the character and not 
merely duplicating some parts while omitting other essentials? 
The next one, (¢c), demands at just what angle may we apply 
the whetstone of precept to the juvenile moral consciousness, 
that we may sharpen and not dull it? or must we reject that 
time-honored instrument altogether? And finally, what habits 
have moral worth? Which have the greatest value? What, if 
anything, does habit-forming lack of being the whole of effective 
character-building? Most emphactically arises the problem, 
much mooted of late, how may we be assured that the habits 
carefully formed in school will be carried over into the activities 
of life? Surely, if education is a science and character its aim, 
these and other such questions should be studied until answered 
by everyone who assumes to practice the art of teaching. 
To make more definite our plea for a character-centered 
pedagogy, the following central topics are suggested as a pos- 
sible content, though detail or defense is impossible here. 
1. The teacher must be brought to realize the possibility of 
establishing a definite type of character, individual or national, 
definitely planned in advance and wrought out through specific, 
organized educational effort. He must magnify his office and 
have a vitalizing faith that schools may make the nation. Selec- 
tions from the history of education, studied strictly from this 
point of view, are quite conclusive. The conscious policy or 
organized practice introduced into the education of any people 
should be correlated with the resulting type of character. Ma- 
terials are needed for the definite illustration of the influence 
of local school organization or individual teachers upon com- 
munity or individual life. Nearly everyone knows a few such 
instances of an inspiring sort, but we need enough of them to 
establish a conclusive correlation. 
2. An ideal of the character to be established should be 
definitely considered, but not as an aggregation of abstract 
“virtues.” Certainly not with a view to moulding all in one 
cast, to restraining spontaneity in the slightest, or assuming 
the divine function of making men in one’s own image. There 
should be a concrete recognition of qualities that make for good 
and traits that make for evil, based upon some sympathetic but
-P-A-G-E-87
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 87 
scientific child study. Heroes of history and literature will 
afford concrete materials for comparison and analysis. In pur- 
suing those studies we are forbidden to spoil a good story by 
moralizing. Here, having the facts, let us moralize, not mawk- 
ishly, but with frank, vigorous selective thinking as in any 
other subject. Here we may study educational aims. To the 
classic three, practical, disciplinary, and culture, add citizen- 
ship, social efficiency, self-realization and as many more as may 
appeal to student or teacher. Then we will find that all these 
are not antagonistic, but harmonious and mutually supplemen- 
tary, and that moral character involves and co-ordinates them 
all. Possibly the formulation of the ideal, so far as that may 
be desirable, would eventuate in something like this: The inte- 
gration into a stable and balanced self, or personality, of every 
mental and physical capacity, each being developed to its fullest 
and highest functioning, and all dominated by a habit of align- 
ing motives and conduct in harmony with the highest ideal of 
which the self can at the time conceive. 
8. Having the design, the character builder may well turn to 
consider the materials with which he has to deal. The recent 
development of psychology on genetic, functional, dynamic and 
social lines is peculiarly happy for this purpose. The laws of 
habit, the essential unity not only of the higher psychical pro- 
cesses, but of all psycho-physical functioning, their indis- 
solubility for purposes of training, the utter interdependence 
of all the parts of the complex nature, all these are inspiring 
facts, simple to learn and apply and yet crowded out for the 
“compartment plan” of teaching psychology. “The whole mind 
active, this is will.” but the whole mind is not truly active and 
functioning without the whole body vigorous and duly con- 
tributing. The will in action is the true meaning of the whole 
psychic life and of man’s significance as a human being and 
hence is his moral character. Such problems may well be 
treated in a most untechnical fashion, clear even to those who 
have had no previous training in, psychology, and with constant 
reference to the periods of child-life—the gradual and sound 
building of character through psychical and physical activity. 
The analysis of conduct, in which the pupils may well be more 
keen than the teacher, will tend to show that back of every act, 
however evil, is an instructive impulse which is fundamentally 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
good and usable in the noblest of living if rightly directed. A 
habit of such analysis would of itself be of incalculable service 
to any trainer of children. 
4. Some guiding principles of moral training would evolve 
from such preparatory study and might take some such lines as 
these : 
(a) Moral education is concerned with the whole child. 
Every capacity is available for and essential to full moral 
development. Avoidable failure to develop any capacity is im- 
moral. 
(6) It is concerned with every relation, activity and time of 
life. It is contributed to by all conscious and unconscious in- 
fluences, institutions and environments. Especially is every 
phase of school activity significant. 
(ec) It is a positive, not negative, process; accomplished 
through expression, not repression ; activity, not passivity ; what 
the child does, not what is done to him; dynamic, not static; 
directive, not corrective; not exorcising of devils, but exercising 
of God-given impulses; making, not breaking the will. 
(d) Development of any tendency is through use, suppres- 
sion through disuse. 
(e) Conscious codperation of the child is essential to economy 
of process and permanence of results. Children do appreciate 
and respond to the highest motives which are concerned with 
the activities of their several stages of development, and these 
may be made as effective as any lower ones in conduct, while 
. adult motives would be useless in child conduct. Few errors 
are more serious than underestimating the child’s moral percep- 
tion and bolstering up conduct on temporary and insincere 
motives instead of developing the highest through use. 
(f) Desirable habits and attitudes developed in school or 
home must be brought to definitely formulated concepts in 
order to insure their being carried over into the general activi- 
ties of life. 
The last (e) and (f), seem to follow naturally from the vari- 
ous studies of “formal discipline” and the conclusions reached. 
Objections to formal moral instruction on the ground of its 
being uninteresting to the child or tending to make the child 
morbid or blazé, are best explained by the traditional content 
cf many such courses. Time forbids more than the insistence
-P-A-G-E-89
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 89 
that there is a content and method for this subject which is as 
much more interesting than school subjects geenrally as life 
itself is more interesting than sums and sentences, as inherently 
wholesome and timely as any nature-study or literature that 
ean be devised. It is merely the study of the child’s best self 
and his best and happiest relations. 
Naturally the teacher’s course will include a survey of the 
educative and moral significance of play and recreation as well 
as of school conduct and studies. Happily some of our treaties 
on school management are character-centered rather than 
school-centered. Methods in arithmetic mean something vastly 
more inspiring when mind and character are the criteria of 
progress instead of marks and promotions, or even mathemat- 
ical efficiency. Every special method and every kind of school 
activity may be reviewed, or studied de novo from the stand- 
point of its character-making value. The student in observa- 
tion work may well be called upon to analyze teaching exercises 
and conditions as to their elements that make for sincerity, for 
certainty and clearness of idea, for purity of aspiration or lofti- 
ness of purpose, for unity and worth of the personality, as well 
as for habits that count for character. No teacher anywhere, 
much less a practice student, should presume to go before a 
class of children without the consciousness that every act of 
his, and more significantly, every act of the pupil, is making 
for character. But all such thoughts and analyses will be vague 
unless organized into a system. 
Have we the requisite knowledge available? All knowledge 
of educational values, whether of method or matter, is of this 
sort. So, probably is all that is not merely mechanical, tradi- 
tional or speculative. While this ordering of topics will doubt- 
less have great value discovering gapes in our pedagogy and 
thus leading to new research and attainments, its newness will 
be more in viewpoint and arrangement than in content.” 
Can we find time for additional courses with more now than 
any of us can cover? If these vital topics have been treated in 
other courses, a resumé with new relations and significances 
will be an ideal review. If not, there is none that we can afford 
to omit. Why cannot a shifting of topics and viewpoint give us 
an inspiring, practical, character-centered pedagogy for the com- 
mon-school teacher who has but the one course with which to 
start?

Criticisms of school work are rampant. Inefficiency is the 
charge. Despite their varying excellencies, the best institu- 
tions, systems and methods are constantly being censured for 
some partial failure. It is not because we deliberately choose 
one kind of development and pay for it by giving up another, 
but with our eyes on some partial aim we lose sight of some 
other. Then the pendulum swings to the neglected side and 
hoi polloi cry out on another “fad.” Can we do better than to 
try centering our attention upon the whole aim—character- 
building? May we not investigate and progress as well in sub- 
jects, methods, schools and systems of schools, and even in the 
development of faculties, by regarding them as tools instead of 
ends? Not merely in theory, but in actual practice? Can we 
bring this about better than by teaching teachers thus to teach? 
The greatest teachers have always been those who have had 
the clearest and highest aims and have kept closest to them. 
Nor can the humblest laborer in the teaching industry be 
specialized as a mere piece-worker so long as it is a whole child 
that comes to school to him.

ILLUSTRATED LESSONS IN MORALS. 
MILTON FAIRCHILD, BALTIMORE, MD. 
“TuLustRATED Lessons in Morals” designated a new method 
of moral instruction. The most influential instruction given by 
the teacher is that given at the time of some incident in school 
life. General opinion has been favorable toward this incidental 
instruction. In the home, the instruction of parents is largely 
incidental, and the reason for this is, that when something hap- 
pens, boys and girls are interested in the discussion of the right 
and wrong involved. It was very natural to suspect that if inci- 
dents of real life could be photographed and made into lantern 
slides and thrown on a screen before large audiences of boys 
and girls, they would be interested in and influenced by the 
discussion of the right and wrong involved, if the discussion 
was carefully adjusted to their degree of intelligence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 91 
From long observation of the free life of children on the 
streets and playgrounds, and at work, it became evident that 
they themselves were disposed to discuss the right and wrong 
of matters in their own world with keen interest and strong 
convictions. It seemed, therefore, that it might be possible by 
photographing these episodes in the lives of boys and girls them- 
selves, which they themselves were likely to discuss from the 
standpoint of morals, we should be able to inject into their own 
thought about these things the intelligent opinion as to right 
and wrong which comes with maturity of mind and experience. 
Photographs were taken, and the first attempt to construct an 
“illustrated lesson in morals” dealt with the topic, “Boys’ 
Fights.” It was exceedingly difficult to secure the necessary 
photographs, and finally I devised a camera which will take 
thirty pictures in a minute; thus enabling me to secure a series 
of instantaneous photographs covering these real happenings in 
the every-day life of children and adults. Later, other illus- 
trated lessons were developed, and in 1906 practical experi- 
ments began in the public schools. They were very successful, 
holding rapt and intense interest for periods of three-quarters 
of an hour to an hour, provoking personal discussion among the 
children themselves, affording an excellent opportunity for the 
teachers to continue the discussion, and influencing profoundly 
the personal convictions and conduct of school children. The 
lessons are very interesting and yet not sensational. They are 
kept on the high plane of true education. Within the last three 
years these illustrated lessons have been given to an aggregate 
audience of about one-hundred thousand boys and girls in some 
twenty different States. 
The titles of the lessons used were, first, “What Men Think 
About Boys’ Fights ;” second, “What I Am Going to Do When 
I Am Grown Up,” and third, “The True Sportsman.” The first 
two were for grammar schools and the last for high schools. 
During the past summer, with the assistance of Mr. Bernard 
N. Baker, of Baltimore, two additional lessons have been pre- 
pared for high school use: one on “Personal and National 
Thrift,” which urges boys and girls to make good use of their 
high school opportunities; and the second, “Who Is the Gentle- 
man,” which explains to high school audiences, intelligent pub- 
lic opinion on that topic. The Moral Education Board includes

one hundred and fifty members, many being leading educators, 
and among them your President, James H. Van Sickle, and 
Edw. F. Buchner, Professor of Education in Johns Hopkins 
University. The clergy are somewhat represented in the mem- 
bership as being particularly interested and intelligent in mat- 
ters of practical morals, and I am happy to say that almost 
all the different denominations are properly represented. 
Your interest and codperation is desired, in order that as 
great a good as is possible from this system of moral instruc- 
tion may be achieved. Such formal instruction as this is inter- 
esting and influential if under favorable circumstances, but will, 
of course, carry little weight, unless codrdained with the other 
accustomed means of moral education: viz., personal influence 
of the teacher, school organizations, indirect influence of studies, 
and incidental instruction and discipline.

KENTUCKY’S EDUCATIONAL AWAKENING. 
J. G. CRABBE, STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, 
FRANKFORT, KY. 
In 1907, under the old cumbersome, iniquitous district school 
system, Kentucky faced squarely certain facts: 
1. There were twenty-five thousand Trustees; five thousand 
could not read nor write; out of the twenty-five thousand, 
fifteen thousand were merely appointed, leaving about ten thou- 
sand who were elected in a poor sort of way. It is an old story 
to say that twenty thousand of these Trustees were not at all 
interested in the schools and that the vast majority only cared 
for a kind of graft to secure certain teachers and perquisites 
available. 
2. There was no local taxation, therefore 
3. There was no money for schoolhouses, school supplies, 
equipment, repairs and incidentals. 
4, There were no high schools. 
5. Salaries were poor, for the teachers simply received “the 
draw.”
-P-A-G-E-93
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 93 
6. There were but few trained teachers and there were but 
little opportunity to secure professional training. 
7. There was no well-defined plan of instruction for the rural 
schools. 
8. There was practically no supervision. The field was too 
big. The Superintendent’s salary was ridiculously small. He 
did not and could not devote his entire time to the schools. Per- 
force, he practiced law, or practiced medicine, or farmed or 
otherwise. 
9. There were no school libraries. 
10. There was no school interest among the people. Of 
course, there was but little interest among the teachers and 
pupils. 
In 1906 a beginning had been made when the General Assem- 
bly voted an annual appropriation of twenty thousand dollars 
each for two State Normal Schools, one at Richmond and one at 
Bowling Green. But the school forces and their friends were 
marshalling for a desperate struggle. On the firing line were 
the Kentucky Educational Association, the Kentucky Develop- 
ment Association, and best of all, the Federation of Women’s 
Clubs. On January 6, 1908, the writer became head of the 
State Department of Education. On the same day the General 
Assembly met in biennial session. The enactments made were 
momentous and this Assembly will doubtless be called “The 
Educational Legislature.” 
1. It passed the County School District Law, or the Sullivan 
bill, which called for a complete reorganization of the school 
system and for the establishment within two years of a high 
school within every county in Kentucky. 
2. It made State College a State University and enlarged the 
scope of its usefulness. 
3. It appropriated a half million dollars for higher education 
and another seventy thousand dollars annually for additional 
maintenance for State University and the Normals. 
4. It passed a bill creating an Educational Commission and 
instructed it to make a thorough investigation of the whole 
school system and report to the next General Assembly. 
5. It passed a bill appropriating forty thousand dollars for 
additional improvements at Kentucky Normal and Industrial 
Institute for Colored Persons.
-P-A-G-E-94
94 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
6. It passed a bill regulating the child-labor law. 
7. It passed a compulsory attendance and truancy law in 
cities of the first, second, third and fourth classes. | 
Here is found the remedy for the glaring defects and failures | 
in the schools—under “the new school law.”: There are eight 
thousand Trustees properly elected and qualified. There is a 
fair amount of money for buildings, equipment and repairs. 
High schools are in full operation. Teachers’ salaries are in- 
creased. Teachers have the inspiration (and money) to attend 
professional schools. Public sentiment is demanding for Super- 
intendents who will devote their entire time to the school busi- 
ness, and as a result the present mere pittances called salaries 
will be commensurate with the duties devolved upon the super- 
intendency and with the demands of the schools. Libraries are 
being established. More than all, all the people are intensely 
interested in the welfare of the schools since the vigorous cam- 
paigning of the past two years. 
Pactically all the counties have made a liberal school levy. 
A conservative estimate of the amount to be realized from the 
county school tax is nearly three-quarters of a million dollars. 
A new schoolhouse is building every day in the year—‘We’re 
Building One a Day.” Nearly all the counties have established 
at least one county high school, while some have opened two, 
three and even five such schools. 
When the “Whirlwind Campaign” for better education in 
Kentucky was inaugurated, the movement was but an untried 
experiment. The leading school men of the country looked 
askance at the scheme and scant favor was accorded it. But the 
“Whirlwind Campaign” of 1908 was a cyclone in Kentucky. 
The entire State was intelligently covered by earnest speakers 
during a period of nine days. Sitxy thousand people heard a 
new gospel of education, of inspiration, of helpfulness, of com- 
mon sense among the plain people. It was a revelation that 
amounted to a revolution. Today a dozen States have inaugu- 
rated their whirlwind campaigns for better education in their 
respective States, and these campaigns bid fair to become as 
popular and successful as the original “Whirlwind Campaign” 
of Kentucky in 1908. The second “Whirlwind Campaign” for 
better education was conducted for seven days, beginning June 
27, 1909, and closing July 4. One hundred earnest speakers  
-P-A-G-E-95
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 95 
were kept in the field. They include many of the most promi- 
nent men and women in business, political and of school life in 
the State. An attempt was made to carry the campaign into 
the rural districts and to try if possible to put new life and 
vigor into the rural schools. In addition to the work in the 
rural districts, an all-day, open-air meeting—a rally day—was 
planned in each county of the State. Hundreds and even thou- 
sands of people were in attendance at these rallies, and in many 
counties it was pronounced the greatest event in the history of 
the county. Special programmes, bands and marching were 
features of these special days. 
Sunday, June 27, was designated as “Public School Sunday,” 
and every clergyman in the Commonwealth was asked to deliver 
on this day, in his own church, at least one address on “Public 
Education in Kentucky.” The results were astounding. On 
Public School Sunday there was nearly five thousand addresses 
made from the pulpits of the State. The audiences estimated 
at nearly a half million people. 
Nearly twenty-five hundred set speeches were made in the 
campaign by the regular, special and local speakers and nearly 
a half million people heard these addresses. This campaign has 
had a wonderful effect in bringing the gospel of public educa- 
tion nearer the hearts of the people. “People Are Thinking.” 
Under the operation of the new County School District Law, 
the local taxes in the counties and districts for the year 1908-9 
were increased from the sum of $180,000.00 in 1907-8, to an 
amount estimated at a million dollars. 
This is a story of real progress. The Educational Commis. 
sion, after a careful and exhaustive study of conditions and 
laws in this and other States of the Union, and after consulta- 
tion with educational leaders at home and abroad, outlined a 
code covering the whole common school system of the State. 
Its report was presented to the General Assembly of this year 
and most of its salient features failed of enactment, as did the 
school code proposed by the Educational Commission of Penn- 
sylvania, and the commisions of other States in their respective 
Legislatures. But with the rural schools under the new school 
law, with one or more high schools for secondary education in 
each county, with well-equipped Normal Schools indispensable 
for the training of teachers and with an aroused public senti-

ment, Kentucky may well look up and take courage. Today 
the arousement is on. A public-spirited press is loyally help- 
ing; the ministry rings clear and certain; the women of the 
States camp on the field and fight as against home and State; 
the lawyer and doctor and the patriot adds his influence to com- 
bat ignorance in his State; and the loyal school men and women 
in the trenches, begrimed with many a bout, throw out the ban- 
ner inscribed, “We Must Educate—For the Little Red School 
House, the Boys and the Girls, and the Commonwealth.” 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
LIMITATIONS TO COLLEGE ATHLETICS. 
JOHN §. FLORY, BRIDGEWATER, VA. 
In this discussion of the athletic question and the proposal of 
certain limitations to some of the sports, let it be understood 
that this paper assumes no antagonistic attitude towards ath- 
letics as such. These sports as a means of recreation are not in 
question, and their proper relation to educational work is freely 
admitted. In their sphere they deserve encouragement and sup- 
port. 
Instead of opposing athletics, therefore, I desire to state at 
the outset my conviction that no educational system is complete 
that does not provide for the systematic training of the body as 
well as the mind, and thereby promote a symmetrical and har- 
monious development. That the body may perform its legiti- 
mate part in educational work, in the best way, it needs the 
same regularity in exercise that the mind receives in the routine 
work of the Tecture room and the laboratory. 
In order that athletics may serve this high purpose, it is im- 
portant that their legitimate sphere in relation to the work of 
education be constantly kept in mind and insisted on. Too 
often are these sports treated as though they were the chief pur- 
pose for which colleges exist, and as if efficiency in them were 
one of the main objects to be attained in a college career. Our 
experience in school work leads us to the conclusion that the 
purposes to be served by athletics in educational work are two 
—to maintain the physical health and vigor of the student body, 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 97 
and to afford means for their mental relaxation and interest. 
By these standards the limitations to be proposed are to be 
largely determined. 
Judged by these measurements, I may make bold to assert 
that football ought to be eliminated from the list of college 
sports. If this seems to be abolition rather than limitation, it 
is answered that it is limitation of the kinds of games. 
The removal of football from the list of sports for college stu- 
dents seems advisable for several reasons. It will be generally 
admitted that this game has modified our academic standards 
in more ways than one, and these not to the advantage of the 
college or the student body. The game has introduced into our 
colleges a class of young men, who by their natural endowments 
and tastes, are not qualified to become students. They are 
in school not because they desire to educate themselves, or mean 
to apply themselves to academic pursuits, but—to play ball. 
Their want of interest in their work begets a similar want of 
interest in their associates, so that young men educationally 
inclined and with a sincere desire to fit themselves for a career 
are diverted from their purpose by the irresistable example of 
the athletic hero. In this way our academic standards are 
being vulgarized. Instead of our former lofty intellectual and 
ethical standards, based on scholarship and genuine intellectual 
attainments, ‘the college hero is coming more and more to be 
the physical giant, who can bolt a line or kick a goal. This dis- 
position to shift our standards of academic excellence from the 
intellectual to the physical points to a sad day for the American 
college. 
But not only does football set up a false standard of excel- 
lence; it also tends to lower the standard of scholarship in the 
institution where it exists. The immense advertising that a 
winning football team gives a college has led to questionable 
methods of securing athletic material. These football special- 
ists enter the university in the fall, play through the season, 
attend lectures when they can spare time from their practice, 
and trust to chance, to cramming, or the leniency of an easy 
professor to pass the term examinations. And it is a surprise 
to the uninitiated in how many instances they succeed in pass- 
ing their subjects. Such proceedure naturally lowers the stand- 
ard of scholarship and breeds indifference and carelessness in 
ae

  98 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the student body, for it must not be forgotten that the athlete 
is always a star and a model for a large portion of his fellow- 
students. 
Again, football is in its nature exclusive. A very small pro- 
portion of men in any college play football. It has almost 
nothing to do with maintaining the general physical health of 
a student body. The few who practice the game are apt to be 
over-trained rather than normally trained, while the great 
crowd look on and almost shout themselves hoarse as their share 
of the exercise. Thus it follows that no one, it may be, receives 
the best kind of physical training from the game. 
Another consideration has been emphasized, especially dur- 
ing the season recently closed. This is the element of danger 
in the game. The unprecedented number of casualities reported 
—thirty-two deaths, according to a New York statistician, and 
more than two hurdred injuries, many of them serious—has 
brought about a revolt of sentiment against the game as a 
means of recreation. And the fact that State Legislatures are 
called upon to prevent the game by law, and that school boards 
and city councils are working to the same end, as witness New 
York and Washington, shows how widespread and determined 
the opposition is. If there was any hope of modifying the rules 
so as to remove the element of undue danger, elimination might 
still not be necessary. But the difficulty is fundamental. The 
necessity of downing a man, and that in the most violent way 
possible, with the prospect of piling twenty-one others on top 
of him, is too radical a feature of the game to admit of change. 
without making the game a new one. As it stands, the game is 
dangerous and brutal beyond all justification. He who engages 
in it does so at the risk of his life. 
The experiment tried in New York City a few weeks ago has 
its serious side, and may well be looked upon with some degree 
of alarm. When the athletic teams of two of the leading Cana- 
dian colleges cames to our metropolis and gave what has been 
called a fine exposition of the Rugby game, the sporting element 
of New York City looked on with passive interest. The spec- 
tacle was too tame. Yet it is admitted that there was brilliant 
playing and the teams were evenly matched. But no one was 
killed. Only a few players were slightly hurt. The spectators 
turned away with evident disgust. And this is the important

point; if our athletics are being developed (?) to the point 
where it is necessary to kill people in order to make the game 
interesting, it is high time for the heads of American colleges 
to get together and abolish from their midst a game of such in- 
humane tendencies. 
With football abolished the way would be open to another 
matter of great importance. It would leave the field clear for 
the development of a new ethical and academic standard in our 
American colleges. I have already referred to the influence of 
football upon these. With this tendency to grossness removed, 
could not the ambitions of the young men in our colleges be 
directed more to ethical ideals, to the winning of laurels in ora- 
tory, debate, poetry, journalism, authorship? At the same time 
the real purpose of college athletics could be better conserved, in 
that useful exercise could be more generally distributed to the 
student body, and the ethical tone of our institutions would be 
greatly improved. 
The only other game to which I can make special reference 
is baseball. This truly American game is one of the best, clean- 
est, most scientific ever introduced into an American college. 
Its popularity for half a century has remained unabated. As 
a fine embodiment of the best features of physical training, com- 
bined with the genuine mental excitement and the qualities that 
cultivate in the player prompt decision and accurate judgment, 
it is probably without an equal among our American sports. 
Yet this excellent game is not without its unfortunate adjuncts. 
Chief among these are the training table and the professional 
coach? 
Both of these introduce an element of professionalism into 
the game that is foreign to the spirit of true sport, and should, 
therefore, be removed. Amateur coaching can probably be made 
just as helpful as that of the professional type, and without 
besmirching the game with an unwholesome odium. For 
wherever professionalism enters the free spirit of play is at 
once dissipated. The training table, too, strikes at the very 
vitals of amateur sport. College athletics, in their very nature, 
should be of this class, and should seek to provide recreation 
and exercise for an entire student body. The training table at 
once segregates a small group, upon whom are lavished special 
privileges and favors. This destroys the democratic idea of the

college circle and sets apart a small group as sort of profes- 
sional entertainers. To these limitations I would propose one 
other: that no one be allowed to represent a college on its ath- 
letic teams whose scholarship is not up to a good standard. A 
regulation of this kind, strictly enforced, would have the good 
effect of eliminating from most of our institutions of learning 
a very undesirable class among the student body. 
Another matter of even greater importance, it may be, than 
the latter has to do with the methods of fiancing athletic asso- 
ciations. The loose relationship usually existing between these 
organizations and the institutions under whose dominion they 
exist puts almost unlimited power into their hands. They ar- 
range their schedules of games, assuming heavy financial obliga- 
tions, often hold valuable property in their own right, which 
they manage in their own way, and in general have but casual 
relations with the authorities over them. Such conditions are 
permitted to exist because of the prevalent belief that interfer- 
ence of college authorities in athletic affairs would ruin the col- 
lege. Thus the associations have gone on working out their own 
destiny, and the splendid advertising the colleges get from their 
efforts have usually induced the authorities to keep hands off. 
The results of this policy have generally been in a high degree 
satisfactory to both parties, but it may be a serious question 
whether they have been for the best interests of either. 
Thus without restraint, the associations have dipped into ath- 
letics pretty heavily. One of the New England universities last 
year spent considerably more than a hundred thousand dollars 
on athletics. If the published statistics are to be trusted, five 
of our Eastern universities cleared $182,000 on football in one 
season. This looks like a good deal of money to spend for sport. 
While some of it could doubtless be applied to better purposes, 
this is not the chief consideration. More important is the spirit 
of business that it introduces into our college life. These large 
enterprises, once unertaken by the young men of the colleges, 
they have to plan to meet their obligations as they mature. 
This leads to the inevitable “gate” with its attendant abuses 
and inconstency. 
The fact that heavy obligations have to be met leads to the 
conduct of college games in a spirit of business, whereas all col- 
lege athletics should be conducted in the spirit of sport. If all
-P-A-G-E-101
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 101 
gate fees could be abolished and college authorities and athletic 
associations unite their efforts to provide suitable amusements 
gatis, most of the objectionable features connected with college 
athletics would at once disappear. But as long as admissions 
are charged to inter-collegiate games, and as long as these ad- 
missions return a handsome annual revenue, it is too much to 
expect that the schools themselves will take the initiative in 
developing a system of physical culture that will extend to the 
entire student body 
This matter has, however, been engaging the attention of lead- 
ing college officials. 
Recently the heads of several of our large universities have 
expressed themselves freely in regard to the invasion of athletics 
and other collegiate adjuncts into the real sphere of college 
work. They feel the need of faculty regulation in athletic 
sports, among other things. And a reaction in this direction is 
sure to come. But it is not a matter to be corrected by one in- 
stitution, or a few of them. This has been tried several times 
with the inevitable result that the institution suffered im- 
mensely, from diminished patronage and influence, as a result. 
The concerted codperation of college authorities will be neces- 
sary to effect the change. But if a number of the leading insti- 
tutions will unite on some reasonable basis of action it can be 
done. 
If some such move could be inaugurated among our leading 
educational institutions, a wonderful reform could soon be 
effected in our athletic situation. With football removed, base- 
ball freed from its present taint of professionalism, and the en- 
tire athletic situation raised from a commercial level to a basis 
of true sport, most, if not all, of the objectionable features that 
becloud our present athletic horizon would disappear, and with 
them would go much of the prejudice and the feeling of opposi- 
tion that these things have inadvertently brought against ath- 
letics in general. To make such a move successful will require 
backbone of the part of college authorities, but it can be done; 
and to the immense advantage of the young men in the colleges, 
the infinite delight of many anxious parents, and the great im- 
provement of the colleges and universities themselves.

[aBsTRACT OF PAPER.] 
MUSIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH. 
CAROLINE B. BOURGARD, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Tue coming days seem full of promise. There is a stir, an 
expectancy which presages a general awakening. Only casual 
observation is necessary to discern that the commercial instinct 
of men of business is directed to the unexplored resources of our 
section. Development is the absorbing aim and codperative 
effort has taken the place of competition as a means of attain- 
ment. 
Similarly in the matter of educational advancement the con- 
viction that the unification of forces for concentrated effort as 
a necessary condition for the consummation of greater and 
quicker achievement has been the raison de’ tre for the organi- 
zation of educators into the 8. E. A. 
Just as a man has three-fold nature, physical, intellectual and 
spiritual, all three capable of and designed for unfoldment for 
the full expression of normal existence, so our Southland must 
grow not only commercially, industrially, educationally, but 
also in the direction of art, which is the culmination, the per- 
fect flower of the life of its people. 
But is the growth of art as expressed in musical form as sure 
as that of industry and education? Statistics are meagre, and 
these do not show many important original contributions nor 
that the creative forces are active. Is this dormancy due to the 
lack of stimulating conditions? 
The compositions of the world’s great music masters are per- 
meated by the essence of beauty, inspired by a love of nature, 
her noble trees in field and forest, the fragrance and loveliness 
of the flower, the inarticulate voicings of gurgling brooks and 
rushing streams, the mysterious instincts and songs of birds, the 
wonderful manifestations of God’s power and manifoldness in 
insect and animal life. You feel, too, the thrill of human love, 
passion, friendship, love of home and fatherland. The longings 
of the soul find expression in immortal sacred compositions. 
Sorrow, anguish and woe have played upon the harp strings of 
the soul and produced the sweetest strains almost divine. Bond-

age and affliction have been agencies in bringing forth a people’s 
grandest songs. But does the South lack these inspirational 
elements? They seem to one to be inherencies awaiting, like 
rich veins of precious ore, the human force that can discover and 
use them. The very name Southland stirs the imagination, sug- 
gesting the poetry of beauty, honor and truth. Does not nature 
here find lavish expression in every conceivable, diversified 
form and by transcendent beauty and grandeur invite loving re- 
search into her unfathomable depths. Our people have had full 
measure, too, of pain and suffering, but expression has failed 
through musical form. The songs we claim and love so well, 
“Old Folks at Home,” “Old Black Joe,” “Old Kentucky Home,” 
were written by a man whose home was in the East. Our melo- 
dies, such as Dixie, etc., are borrowed. 
There is no lack of musical activity within our borders, espe- 
cially in our largest cities, which have their teachers and stu- 
dents, their clubs, choral organizations, orchestras, etc. Many 
of our States even have organized associations in the last few 
years. But it may be noted that in the main our musical 
leaders have come to us from abroad instead of being home pro- 
ductions. German influence is still a dominant force. Another 
consideration is that this activity is the outcome of adult, ma- 
ture effort which in its nature is limited and restricted by the 
laws of life. This work cannot be discredited, being worthy of 
all possible encouragement, but the claim that musical develop- 
ment depends solely upon the widening of its scope is subject to 
question. 
A tree never yet has grown downward from apex to its roots. 
We are all familiar with Darwin’s deep regret that being in his 
youth indifferent to the phenomena of sound and the study of 
music, he became in his maturity, as he expresses it, atrophied, 
utterly unable to understand and appreciate and be influenced 
by its beauty. 
A study of the lives of musical geniuses proves that stimulat- 
ing environment in the earliest years was a recognized factor. 
They imbibed music as naturally as they breathed in air. The 
importance of the first six years of life is yet dimly understood. 
An authority claims that a child of six years has already 
learned far more than a student learns in his entire university 
course. Certainly these years greatly determine our predilec-  
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tions and bias in maturity. Can one ever fully escape their in- 
fluence? Parents intuitively apprehend that in this period the 
beginnings in sense training must be made and stimuli are 
willingly supplied, but their indifference towards the stimula- 
tion of the auditory sense is incomprehensible. 
Sight is universally considered the pre-eminent sense, but 
surely the sense of hearing is a close second. The assertion has 
been made that sight and hearing are the same in substance, 
only different in manifestation of the phenomenon vibration. 
My purpose is to urge not the neglect of eye-training, but 
careful systematic ear-training from birth and the giving of 
special attention to those children who are, or seem, defective 
in this direction. 
A most potent factor for music development is school music. 
In the North and East this subject has established its right as 
an important school subject, but statistics indicate that in the 
‘Southern States it is in many places still a novelty, and in 
thers yet in the experimental stage. 
The attitude of musicians towards this branch of musical 
“effort has been, as a rule, if not actually unfriendly and hostile 
at least indifferent and neglectful. This may be due to a lack 
-on their part of a knowledge of educational principles and peda- 
wgogy and also to the inadequate qualifications of supervisors. 
Personal observation is the basis for my conclusion that in 
the past the training of musicians was mainly mechanical, to 
secure technical skill in the use of some instrument, intellectual 
and cultured exercise being, if not totally unconsidered, a mere 
incident. This training produced skillful executants, sometimes 
virtuosi, but was not calculated to develop teachers capable of 
handling the subject scientifically, or of comprehending its 
power as an educational force. 
The supervisor, new in name and function, called suddenly, 
sometimes by a mere accident, to operate in an unfamiliar field, 
has naturally seldom measured up to the exacting requirements 
of a most difficult position, for he must be a composite of ability 
in the various branches of the art in addition to possessing edu- 
cational qualifications and personal endowments, such as mag- 
netism, leadership, etc. 
Likewise the efforts of the grade teacher, upon whom sud- 
denly developed the new task of teaching an intangible, elusive
-P-A-G-E-105
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 105 
subject, withobt grasp of the subject matter or an understand- 
ing of its value in the school, its relation to the other subjects 
and inter-relation to pedagogical method, were naturally unable 
to command the respect of professional musicians. 
These causes and the isolated self-centered, unorganized 
activity of musicians have retarded growth and perhaps in- 
fluenced educators to withhold their interest and assistance. 
The function of school music is educational involving sense 
training, mental development, the esthetic unfoldment in the 
fostering of a love for the best music and the highest ideals, 
the acquisition of music as an emotional language and stimula- 
tion for self-expression of the creative powers, and in this 
scheme of development, in this period of life with its founda- 
tion of the first six years’ accumulation of sound experience, 
lie the germs of growth and power, the hope of music’s future. 
Child nature is wonderful. What potentialities are im- 
bedded in their direct, inquiring minds, awaiting the influences 
that shall quicken them into expression. Children are abso- 
lutely fearless and confident of inherent power to do when the 
teacher’s attitude is positive, optimistic, expressing a real faith 
in them. 
The time seems ripe when we should discourage the whole- 
sale borrowing of foreign song material and stimulate original 
output. We violate psychological law when we use songs and 
music based on facts unknown to our children’s experience. We 
need American music, American song writers who can deal 
with our own conditions and give them noble musical form. 
In summarizing what I consider dominating forces for the 
advancement of Southern music the following points are em- 
phasized : 
1. Organization of professional musicians. The uniting of 
isolated forces and the substitution of codperative action for 
narrowness, self-interest, and unfriendly criticism. 
2. A recognition of the value of good music in the homes. 
Listening to music is one of the greatest factors in musical 
training. Kindergarten teachers, librarians, etc., are very 
active in organizing mothers’ clubs in which the mothers are 
taught the importance of coéperating with these institutions. 
Professional musicians, supervisors, and educators should use 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the same means of teaching mothers the value of early training 
through musical practice and intelligent listening. 
3. The adequate training in music of grade teachers in Nor- 
mal schools. 
4. Supervisors trained to meet all the requirements of a posi- 
tion demanding broad general culture, educational and musical 
qualifications of a high order and the ability to be a musical 
leader in the community. Heretofore the training of super- 
visors has been done mainly by summer schools instituted by 
publishing houses interested in a certain system of music books. 
A supervisor’s department is needed in our colleges and univer- 
sities. 
5. A more general use of the educational journals for ex- 
ploitation of ideas relative to musical facts and pedagogical 
practice by musical authorities. An examination of these peri- 
odicals shows practically no suggestions to grade teachers in 
giving music lessons, no discussions which would show the rela- 
tion between educational principles and music study. Songs 
for occasional use are the main contributions. Often these are 
of the most trivial character, mere jingle and clap-trap of no 
enduring value. Often, too, a beautiful melody familiar as an 
expression of sentiment of a certain type has been crudely ap- 
plied to words entirely different in character from that implied 
by the melody with no thought for fitness. These are musical 
falsehoods, most harmful and disintegrating in their influence. 
Space devoted to musical discussion could be made of incal- 
culable benefit if used to meet the needs of teachers. 
6. The furtherance of school music by all educators and pro- 
fessional musicians who should understand that any improve- 
ment in this field means increased power and activity in the 
musical life of the community. Children should hear much 
good music, the best artists, if possible, in the various branches 
of the art, and musicians should not be unwilling to assist in 
all projects looking to bringing children into contact with 
music, 
7. The music department of the S, E. A. can become an active 
force in promoting discussions which shall formulate the best 
thoughts as to methods, usages and to fix standards.

MANUAL ARTS IN RELATION TO HOME LIFE IN 
RURAL COMMUNITIES. 
MISS MAGGIE GARLINGTON, LAURENS, 8. C. 
Mr. President—I would like to treat the subject of “Manual 
Arts in Relation to Home Life in Rural Communities” in a way 
that is needed in many of our South Carolina rural districts. 
In out-of-way corners of the country and elsewhere are old- 
fashioned schoolhouses of uncertain ages. Often you see be- 
grimed and falling ceilings, dingy walls, destitute of pictures, 
unpolished stove, tattered shades, forked sticks nailed to the 
walls for hat hangers, a dark spot on the wall for a blackboard, 
and one lonely eraser. Can we expect the rural homes of the 
present and the future to be much better than this dark pic- 
ture? <A healthful and a beautiful schoolroom will lead to 
more beautiful results in the home. 
How can our unsightly little schoolhouses be changed when 
the school funds are so limited? If the teacher is energetic 
and much interested in her work, she can conceive many plans 
by which needed funds can be obtained. Entertainments may 
be given during the year, sometimes several dollars can be got- 
ten by private subscription, and in many ways during the year 
small amounts may be obtained. 
One South Carolina teacher changed the dingy walls of her 
schoolroom to snowy whiteness by the use of Alabastine. Much 
of the work was done by her own hands. She put in window 
panes, hung the new pictures, which were the reproductions of 
famous paintings and were neatly framed, and the shades she 
placed at the windows. Later she purchased blackboards, 
erasers, a table cover, vase, soap, towels, a dust pan, a hoe, and 
a rake. For the yard she purchased flower seeds, and as the 
funds were so meager, she requested the Congressman from her 
district to send grass seed, which added much to the surround- 
ings. 
It seems useless to say that no slovenly results will come 
from children accustomed to such an atmosphere of order and 
beauty. Such schoolrooms are none too good for the most out- 
of-the-way ‘corners. The children will imbibe this spirit, this

love for the beautiful, and in a very short time you will find 
many improvements in their homes; the parents will catch the 
spirit and later it will add pleasure, beauty, and refinement to 
the rural communities.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF TEXAS, 
CARLOS BEE, ESQ., SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. 
On March 2, 1836, sixty patriotic and brave pioneers, far 
from the ennobling influences of civilization, but imbued with 
the spirit of their ancestors of 1776, assembled at the small vil- 
lage of Washington, on the Brazos River, in the then Mexican 
province of Texas, and again emulating their patriotic ances- 
tors, declared that, when a government ceased to protect the 
lives, liberty, and property of its people, for the advancement 
of whose happiness it was instituted, the first law of nature, 
the right of self-preservation, and a sacred obligation to society 
enjoined upon the people the right to abolish such government, 
create another calculated to rescue them from impending dan- 
gers and secure to them their welfare and happiness; and that 
the necessity of self-preservation decreed eternal political sepa- 
ration. They, fearlessly and confidently, committing the issue 
to the decision of the Supreme Arbiter of the destinies of 
nations, declared the present imperial commonwealth of Texas 
to be a free, sovereign and independent Republic, and at the 
point of the sword and through the dark valley of the Alamo 
and of Goliad, established their declaration on the plains of 
San Jacinto, and for nine long, dark years maintained among 
the powers of the earth, a sovereign, free and independent re- 
public, to be finally merged in the galaxy of States, where in 
the providence of God it is destined to shine with effulgence 
and glory through the life of our great Republic. With pro- 
phetic ken these men declared that “it is an axiom in political 
science, that unless a people are educated and enlightened, it is 
idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty or the capacity 
for self-government.” 
That declaration, promulgated in times of struggle and hard- 
ship, became the basis and the cornerstone of that system of
-P-A-G-E-109

free education now blessing Texas, unsurpassed in its magni- 
tude by that of any State in the Union. 
In 1839 President Mirabeau B. Lamar, in his first message 
to Congress, urging the passage of an act by Congress for set- 
ting apart from the public domain to each county then exist- 
ing, or thereafter to be created, four leagues (17,712 acres) of 
land for school purposes, used the following language, which 
served as a classic in the cause of popular education. 
“Education is a subject in which every citizen feels a deep 
and lively concern. It is admitted by all that the cultivated 
mind is the guardian genius of democracy, and while guided 
and controlled by virtue, is the noblest attribute of man. It 
is the only dictator that freeman acknowledge and the only 
security that freemen desire. The influence of education, in the 
moral world, as in the physical, renders luminous what was 
before obscure. Cultivation is as necessary to the supply of 
rich intellectual and moral fruits as are the labors of the hus- 
bandman to bring forth the valuable product out of the earth. 
The present is a propitious moment to lay the foundation of 
a great moral and intellectual edifice, which will in after years 
be hailed as the chief ornament and blessing of Texas.” 
And the moment was propitious and the foundation was laid, 
for that which constitutes the pride of every loyal Texan, its 
public free school system. 
Pause with me and consider the conditions under which the 
foundation of this splendid system was laid. Texas was yet 
in the throes of a revolution, her Treasury empty, her domain 
unoccupied, and her place among nations unrecognized, save 
by her mother, the United States, and yet provision was made 
for a university and common schools, for institutions for the 
deaf and dumb, the blind and the insane. 
When we consider that the domain of Texas belonged to those 
whose prowess and courage had rescued it from Mexico by the 
title of the sword—a title accepted as more perfect than that 
in fee simple—and that the founders of Texas could have ap- 
propriated it all to themselves and made their children and 
their children’s children rich beyond human comprehension, 
but instead gave only small sections of 1,280, 640, and 320 
acres of land as a recognition for services rendered and devoted 
the remainder to the public good and for the use of future

generations, this civic act of unselfish patriotism shines more 
resplendently than the glorious achievements of the Alamo, 
“with no messenger of defeat,” of Goliad with blood-stained 
treachery, or of San Jacinto, “which historians may not record 
as one of the great battles of the world, but which was des- 
tined to exert an influence upon the destiny of the human race 
greater than all the conflicts that established or subverted the 
petty kingdoms of the ancient world.” 
Subsequent legislation provided that the alternate sections 
of all lands granted to railroads, to the improvements of rivers 
and similar objects should be set aside as a public free school 
fund, and when sold were to be invested in interest-bearing 
securities as a permanent fund, and the interest set apart for 
the support of the schools. 
According to the report of the Superintendent of Education 
in 1909, the total number of acres of land received by the per- 
manent school fund, under the laws mentioned, was about 
44,000,000, of which 8,000,000 odd have not been sold, and with 
the exception of $1,575,000, placed by act of 1856 to the credit 
of the general school fund, and $2,000,000, donated by the 
United States in bonds, the permanent school fund has derived 
solely from the sale of lands, and amounted on January 1, 
1909, to $61,526,242.75. The interest derived from this amount 
is distributed to each school district in the State as a supple. 
ment to the local tax, and last year amounted to $6.25 per 
capita, or a total of $5,931,387.50, distributed as the State ap- 
portionment from the available school fund for the year 1909. 
There are two hundred and forty-four counties in Texas, 
and besides five hundred and twenty-six independent school 
districts which receive their proportion of the State appor- 
tionment. 
As an illustration of the advantage of the State apportion- 
ment, I will cite the amount received by the City of San An- 
tonio, in which I live, and also the amount received by Bexar 
County, of which San Antonio is the county seat. For the 
scholastic year ending August 21, 1908, Bexar County received 
from the State as a supplement to the local taxation, the sum 
of $28,998.00, and San Antonio received from the State 
* $106,243.75. 
It will be readily seen that the unselfish wisdom and fore-
-P-A-G-E-111

sight of the fathers of Texas is now an important factor in the 
education of the youth of Texas. 
According to the scholastic census of Texas for the year 
beginning September 1, 1909, there are in Texas 949,006 chil- 
dren between the years of seven and seventeen, of whom 
756,770 are white and 192,236 colored. For the year ending 
1909 there were employed in the public schools of Texas 15,881 
white teachers and 3,129 colored teachers, making a total of 
19,010 teachers in the public schools. The property owend by 
the public schools in Texas, outside of the lands and bonds, 
amounts to $17,369,353.87, of which $16,369,721.00 belongs to 
the white schools and $1,099,632.85 to the colored schools. For 
the year ending August 31, 1908, there was a disbursement of 
$9,759,995.85 for school purposes throughout the State. 
It is interesting as indicating not only the growth in popula- 
tion in Texas, but the increased interest in education, to note 
that in 1880 there were 226,439 children within the scholastic 
age, with a per capita allowance of $3.00 for each child and a 
total State apportionment of $697,317.00, while for the year 
ending September 1, 1909, there was a scholastic population of 
949,006, a per capita allowance of $6.25, and a total State ap- 
portionment of $5,931,287.50. These figures not only speak 
volumes for the advancement of the State in wealth and popu- 
lation, but furnish a splendid endorsement of the faithfulness 
and integrity of those entrusted with the care of the public 
school funds and lands, and it is pleasant to state that in this 
day of official peculation and graft, the public school fund of 
Texas, belonging to the children of Texas as a glorious in- 
heritance from their forefathers, has remained inviolate and 
unstained. 
The public school system of the State consists of a State 
University, located at Austin, the capital, with a medical 
branch at Galveston, and an Agricultural and Mechanical Col- 
lege near Bryan, which by the constitution is named as a 
branch of the University, but which is such in theory only, 
being governed by a separate Board of Directors. There are 
four normal colleges for the education of teachers, and the Col- 
lege of Industrial Arts for girls, besides the rural and inde- 
pendent common schools for both the white and colored youth. 
In addition the State maintains an industrial and normal  
-P-A-G-E-112

school for colored youths at Prairie View, controlled by the 
directors of the Agricultural and Mechanical College. From 
the same source also there is maintained a State School for the 
Blind, another for the Deaf and Dumb, a State Orphan’s Home, 
and a Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institute for the colored 
youth, 
It is proper to state that Texas has made no difference be- 
tween the white and colored youth in the matter of education, 
and in spite of the fact that the colored race pay a very small 
proportion of the school taxes, they receive an equal proportion 
of the school fund and their buildings are equally equipped. 
While there is a difference of opinion on this subject, I-believe 
that the interests of the State are best served by making no 
change in this respect. The race problem is an awful spectre, 
but will become worse if ignorance is to remain the portion of 
the inferior race. 
The University of Texas is our pride. Only a little over 
twenty-five years old, it now has an enrollment of over 2,000, 
and its graduates occupy high places in the political, social, 
and legal history of the State. It is a free school, for no tuition 
is charged, and the son of the poor man has equal opportunity 
to enter and remain within its portals and utilize its advan- 
tages as has the son of the rich. It is a part and parcel of the 
public school system of the State. The Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College, with an attendance of from six hundred to 
seven hundred, is also a free public school, and offers the young 
men of Texas an opportunity to do expert work in all lines of 
agriculture and in the several departments of engineering, and 
in addition is a military school with all the advantages which 
the discipline of the soldier bring to the young man. Its gradu- 
ates are to be found in honorable positions in all departments 
of the State. é 
The College of Industrial Arts at Denton is for the practical 
training of the young women of the State in the practical 
things of life, without overlooking those things which make 
woman an ornament and a joy. 
I could speak on indefinitely and yet not do half justice to 
the public school system of Texas, but your time and patience 
forbid. To eulogize education before this cultivated and splen- 
did assemblage of educators—and that, too, by a layman— 
would be not only a presumption, but a work of superogation.

I believe in the system of popular education as thoroughly 
as a Christian believes in his Savior, and I realize that into the 
hands of the educated man of the future will more than ever 
before be placed the hope and perpetuity of our great republic. 
We cannot, we must not, be laggards in the struggle to uplift 
our beloved South. In our enlightened times there is no excuse 
for ignorance. There may be an excuse for stupidity, that is 
a visitation of God. But there is no excuse for the lack of the 
elementary knowledge afforded by our free school system. I 
hope the day will come when not one illiterate man or woman 
will be found in our entire South. I favor compulsory educa- 
tion within a limited period. It is urged that it is paternal. 
My friends, all government is paternal. The government, that 
for its preservation takes the vicious citizen from his home 
and family as a punishment for his transgression against its 
law, is paternal. It were better for the State to assert more 
authority over the education of the citizen. Then it will be 
required to exercise less authority over his individual actions 
and personal liberty, for as ignorance is the breeding cause 
of crime, so is education its remedy and cure. 
I lay a son’s tribute at the feet of Texas for her progress 
and advancement along educational lines, but wish that, in 
common with her sister states, she would realize that without 
money, education is crippled, and that by reducing expenses 
in other avenues she would increase them for the betterment 
of her youth. Having passed the necessity for further educa- 
tion ourselves, we are apt to grow careless of its necessity to 
others. It is better to spend one dollar to fit and equip the 
youth of the land for life’s battles, than to spend one cent in 
the building of jails, penitentiaries and court houses. 
Thomas Jefferson, than whom no greater governmental phi- 
losopher ever lived, truly stated that “the diffusion of light and 
education were the sources most to be relied on for ameliorat- 
ing the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the hap- 
piness of men.” 
The private schools serve their useful purpose and I cheer- 
fully give tribute to the splendid results produced by them, as 
evidenced by the worthy and successful men and women who 
look with pride to the alma mater, but I consider the system 
of popular education as a governmental function, the grandest

conception of the human mind, working upon the problems 
which elevate and ameliorate the condition of men, and which 
bear upon their relations to each other. 
To this system Texas is dedicated and consecrated. Imperial 
in her domain, she is yet more imperial in her citizenship, and 
holding the banner of popular education high aloft, she points 
with a mother’s pride to her magnificent University and Col- 
lege, her normal, her industrial, her manual, her high and her 
common schools, as the proof of the integrity of her intentions 
and the fulfillment of the pledges made for her by the fathers 
who placed her in the Union of States, where her Lone Star

I—Scuoor Leeisuation In 1909. 
In the general election of November, 1908, an amendment to 
Section 3 of Article 7 of the State Constitution was adopted, 
which amendment raised the limit of local school district tax 
from 20 cents to 50 cents on the $100 valuation of taxable prop- 
erty, and provided that a local school tax might be authorized 
by a majority vote instead of the two-thirds majority vote 
which previously had been required to carry these elections. 
Early in 1909 the Legislature gave effect to this amendment by 
appropriate enactment (Chapter 12, General Laws of 1909). 
Other school legislation of the year may be enumerated as fol- 
lows: 
Provision was made for State aid in the introduction of the 
subjects of agriculture, manual training, and domestic science 
into the State Normal schools, the summer sessions of the State 
educational institutions, and the public schools (General Laws, 
Chapter 113). 
The establishment of the West Texas State Normal College 
was provided for (General Laws, Chapter 119).

I].—Deveropment DurinG THE Five-Year Periop From 1905 
to 1909. 
In 1905 the census rolls showed 782,693 names; in 1909 there 
are 949,006. This includes the increased number that is due 
to including in the enumeration children that are seven years 
old. In 1905 the schools enrolled 692,708 pupils; the last re- 
port shows 754,586. In 1905 the daily attendance was 457,510; 
while the last report shows 496,361. 
Cost or Marntenance.—In 1905 the expense account for 
maintenance was $7,470,825.58; the last report shows $9,511,- 
240.81 as having been expended, representing an increase of 
271-3 per cent. Five years ago the schoolhouse and grounds 
were valued at $10,704,003.11; now they are worth $15,680,- 
365.19, an increase of nearly 47 per cent. The value of school 
libraries has increased from $119,395.58 to $198,413.66, an in- 
crease of 66 per cent. Other equipments have increased from 
$1,056,355.31 to $1,490,575.14, 41 per cent. 
TeacHers’ Crertiricates.—In 1905 certificates as follows 
were held: Third grade, 850; second grade, 9,297; first grade, 
4,586; permanent, 2,155. The latest report shows: Third 
grade, 611; second grade, 10,426; first grade, 4,977; permanent, 
2,618. It is gratifying to note that the third grade certificates 
are decreasing and the permanents are increasing. 
Sararips.—In 1905 the rural teachers were paid $250; last 
year they were paid $289. And I doubt not that the next re- 
port will show that they were paid more than $300 for the cur 
rent year. The annual salaries of teachers in independent dis- 
tricts for the last year averaged $468. The salaries of all 
teachers, white and colored, male and female, throughout the 
State averaged $320. I believe the next report will show for 
the current year an average annual salary of $370. 
Leneru or Term.—In 1905 the schools ran an average of 
114.9 days; last year they ran 124.7 days. The schools in the 
independent districts have been running eight or nine months 
for eight or ten years. The increase has been almost entirely 
in the rural schools. For the first time in the history of the 
State, the schools have exceeded the constitutional length of 
six months. 
Loca Taxes.—In 1905 there were 2,916 districts levying 
local taxes for the benefit of the schools. That year the dis-

tricts raised $1,661,392.15. In 1907 the latest completed sta-

increase of 40 per cent in two years, and they raise $2,624,- 
665.95, an increase of $286,000 per year. 
Country Suprrvision.—The law establishing the office of 
County Superintendent has increased the number of profes- 
sional school men in this office from 43 to 112, and has placed 
more than two-thirds of the school children of the State under 
professional direction and supervision. 
TRAINING oF TnacuurRs.—The faculties of the three normal 
schools, located at Huntsville, Denton, and San Marcos, have 
been increased, and the West Texas State Normal College, at 
Canyon City, has been begun. A science building and a library 
building have been built at San Marcos, a new science building 
at Denton, and a manual training building at Huntsville. The 
Canyon City normal has $150,000 for buildings and equip- 
ment—the largest of any normal school in the State. 
The teaching of agriculture, manual training, and domestic 
science has been introduced into the normal schools upon a re- 
spectable basis.

RELATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE PUB- 
LIC SCHOOL. 
MISS MARY HANNAH JOHNSON. 
One of the most significant movements of modern education 
is the close coédperation of public libraries and schools. The 
codperation is such now that the school goes to the library 
and the library goes to the school. But the pity is that this 
system is well established in only a few cities, and that many 
cities do not make proper efforts to bring about this codpera- 
tion which means so much to the child while at school and par- 
ticularly when school days are over. 
The child should be taught that the public library is the 
“University of the People;” that it is an institution for his 
benefit; that though he may leave school at a very early age 
he has the opportunity to work out an education by his own 
efforts, books and information being served him free of charge 
by the free library.
-P-A-G-E-117
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 117 
It is quite certain that educators are realizing this fact more 
and more and are recommending it as necessary to the broad- 
est education. It is now conceded among the most progressive 
educators that the text book alone for educative purposes has 
heard its death knell. “The ancient notion that all a teacher 
needs is to know his text book remains as a persistent super- 
sition.” The consequence of such investigation is that the text- 
book must be supplemented by some good reading along the 
line of study, whether it be history, literature or science. 
First the modern library is an educational institution, well 
equipped, systemized and organized. It should be broad 
enough in its scope to meet the demands of the scholar, the 
desire of the moderate reader, the requests of the indifferently 
educated, and to render the proper service to the child both in 
the library and through the school. 
The children are the nation’s glory and should have the most 
assiduous attentions as our future men and women. The as- 
sistance the public library can give to advance the progress of 
the child is remarkable in its scope and is a direct contribution 
to education and social advancement. One of the means which 
has brought the most speedy results is close codperation with 
the public schools. Every available means should be employed 
to encourage the children to visit the library, even if upon some 
of their visits they do not read, but occupy their time looking 
about and enjoying picture books. 
The Young People’s Department of the public library should 
be to the public schools what the university library is to the 
university student. 
In Nashville, Tenn., the teachers were invited to bring their 
classes to the library. The librarian meets each class and 
shows them through explaining every department. This has 
been done that the child might better understand that the pub- 
lic library was to be an important part of his educational re- 
sources while at school, and to appreciate the possibility of it 
meeting his needs when schools days are over. 
Another way to codperate with the school is by preparing 
tists of books for study both for teachers and children. 
The story hour is another most potent means by which the 
children are brought to the library and made to become inter- 
ested in the institution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 SOUTHEKN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The most important method of codperation of library and 
school is that of lending books to the schools by grades. 
It is important that the smallest children as well as those 
in advanced grades should be taught the value of reading and 
imbued with a love of it. Many children must needs leave 
school at an early age for work, and at whatever time that may 
be, they should know that they can pursue their work and yet 
continue their education at the public library. The best way 
to accomplish this result is to send books from the public 
library directly to the schoolroom and let the teachers have 
charge of distributing them, there being no doubt that the 
teachers can use them to the best advantages both to child and 
library. 
The system of circulating these books used in Nashville has 
been very satisfactory and continues to grow in usefulness. It 
is in brief as follows: Books are selected by a committee of 
teachers and the librarian, twenty-five copies of each title for 
each section of the grade making fifty books to a grade; this 
plan is carried from the first to the seventh grade inclusive, 
making three hundred and fifty books sent to every school. 
These are sent in heavy boxes and remain nine weeks at a 
school, when they are returned to the library to be mended and 
checked and then sent to another school. By this system four 
boxes are sent to every grade during the year and each child 
is permitted to read eight books, suitable to his years, during 
a session. At the end of the session the boxes are stored in the 
library after having been checked and mended for the next 
year’s work. One of the great advantages of having a new box 
of books every nine weeks is the awakening of interest in the 
child for a new book, an unexplored pleasure. The books are 
sent back to the library at intervals that both institutions may 
keep in closer touch. The children are taught that the books 
come from the library and that there are many more there like 
them in worth and better, and that the library is there free for 
their use, and that it is their university to which they are never 
too old to go. 
In conclusion I desire to say that in every city and town 
there should be a public library, and there must be for the 
greatest breadth and advancement of education and culture 
very close codperation of library and school. They should be 
one in purpose.

SCHOOLROOM FENESTRATION. 
N. R, BAKER, SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS, ENSLEY, ALA, 
No more important topic presents itself to the Superintend- 
ents than that of fenestration. 
It is little less than criminal that schoolrooms in even large 
and presumably modern cities are allowed to exist improperly 
ventilated, heated, and lighted. Superintendents and school 
boards are beginning to study the first two of these subjects 
with a view to bettering exisiting sanitary conditions with the 
result that the new buildings are a great improvement over 
those built twenty, ten or even five years ago. 
But the subject of lighting, or, as I may call it, the new 
science of fenestration, has as yet received all too little at- 
tention. 
Dr. William T. Barry, of Woonsocket, R. L., reports that of 
one thousand (1,000), children examined, 334, or 331-3 per 
cent, had defective vision in one or both eyes. 
I let him tell of his experiment in his own words: 
“The strangest point brought out through an extensive ex- 
amination of the eyes of school children, and adults as well, was 
that, although the eyes of many were seriously affected, the 
persons were apparently ignortant of the fact. The onset was 
insidious, and little notice had been taken until the change was 
irreparable. Twelve pupils were found who had practically no 
sight in either eye, yet who were all doing the required school 
work. The remaining good eye had been saddled with the work 
of both and was doing it as well as possible. It so happened 
that the trouble with the eye was in the retina and the optic 
nerve; and as the child did not complain, and there was 
nothing in the outward appearance of the eye to draw attention 
to it, the trouble passed unnoticed. A number of teachers 
frankly admitted that they had thought many pupils, who in 
reality were suffering most severely from defective vision, 
merely stupid and inattentive.
-P-A-G-E-121
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 121 
“The following table shows the result in detail: 
Both eyes defectlye eich aia we leew ists sac oe oe stcbelp oe 146 
Left eye only .... 
Right eye only .

Number of cases of strabismus, or squint. . eee 
Tnose defective using glasses to correct vision......... 16

In another city two large buildings have been noticed for 
seven years. In one where the lighting was improper, inade- 
quate, and unscientific, the eye sight of the children con- 
stantly grows worse. In the other where the conditions are 
favorable and the fenestration approximately scientifically cor- 
rect the percentage of defective eyesight decreases rapidly after 
entering until the pupils in the seventh grade have normal eyes 
almost without exception. 
In my opinion all lighting for regular grade classroom work 
should be unilateral though some still hold to the bilateral sys- 
tem. This plan is only permissible, however, when the second 
side is from the rear and quite high and so much less in 
space as not to overcome the light from the left. 
The light should always come from the left side and as much 
to the rear as possible, as that coming from near the front 
both interferes with blackboard work and by shining into the 
eyes of the pupils causes a false focus of the light through the 
pupil of the eye. 
The bottom of the windows should be as high as the child’s 
head when seated in order again to avoid the strain of focusing 
the eye to receive one strength of light yet compelling it to read 
by another on the book. This conflict of foci cannot avoid 
working harm to the eyes. 
The light space on the left should be one-fifth to one-seventh 
of the floor space on the room. 
By using steel mullions instead of brick piers, it is possible 
to reduce the space between the windows to eleven inches. 
The necessity for this reduction depends upon the same prin- 
ciple as the necessity for the use of a unilateral system, 
namely: the elimination of cross shadows. It is perfectly ap- 
parent that where cross shadows exist they must of necessity
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
fall across the pages of the book in the hands of the pupils, and 
that to read a page or even a line of a page the eye must con- 
stantly focus and adjust itself. The effect upon the eyes will 
be exactly the same as if one were reading in a flaring or flicker- 
ing light. 
As for heating and ventilating it is better that the ceiling 
be not too high, so for lighting it is better that the room be not 
more than twenty-four feet wide. The great body of light 
comes at an angle of about 30 degrees, probably because the 
thinness of the atmosphere through more nearly vertical lines 
and the impurities and obstructions of more nearly horizontal 
lines cause a concentration of average light at this median 
angle. Therefore, light will fall just twice as far on the floor 
as the height of the windows. The light coming in at the top 
of a window twelve feet above the floor will fall twenty-four 
feet into the room. 
If possible the buildings should be long and narrow and all 
rooms facing east or west. South light is too strong. 
North light is good, but prevents by the unilateral system 
any flooding of the rooms by sunlight. Sunlight is nature’s 
greatest disinfectant. 
Thus far we have discussed building construction and the 
ideal conditions which should obtain in new buildings. But 
generally the most perplexing problem is what to do with build- 
ings already constructed which do not meet these scientific re- 
quirements. There are many well constructed brick and stone 
buildings destined to last for a century yet, and equally des- 
tined to ruin the eyesight of hundreds of children for life un- 
less some remodeling is done or some simple, but well estab- 
lished, laws of fensteration are observed. 
In many one-room country schools light is admitted from 
three or even four sides. 
Let the windows in front of the pupils be closed up with 
shutters or dark green shades or the glass painted with brown 
or dark green paint. The same may be said of those to the 
right of the pupils, though slightly lighter tints would suffice. 
Generally the light from the left in such buildings is not suf- 
ficient owing to the large space between the windows. There- 
fore the bilateral system must be adhered to. 
Wings in city buildings with windows on three sides may
-P-A-G-E-123
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 123 
be treated in the same way. Where there is an abundance of 
light in corner rooms the windows should be darkened on the 
right side of the room so as to prevent shadows over the right 
shoulder. Care should be taken, too, that no window far to the 
front near the teacher’s table is allowed to admit light, through 
even a chink or crevice. 
It is generally best to have the walls tinted buff with cream 
tint above the picture moulding and on ceiling and a brown or 
mahogany wainscot. The window shades should be straw col- 
ored or about the shade of unbleached linen. 
In all cases a dull finish is best as it does not dazzle the eyes 
nor render the blackboard useless by reflection. 
In dark rooms, hall, or basements do not fail to use prismatic 
glass. 
Where the building is already constructed along wrong lines 
the difficulty may be in getting the teachers to adjust the shades 
at various times of the day to suit the light, or consent to allow 
some shades used in the readjustment of the light pulled all the 
way down, while others are all the way, or part way, to the 
top. Her objection is, and will be, an esthetic and based on the 
looks of the rooms from outside. But when the eyes of the chil- 
dren are at stake, what right have we to consider even the laws 
of harmony and esthetics? For what shall it profit a child to 
gain the whole mental world and in so doing lose its own sense 
of sight?

SCHOOL GOVERNMENT VS. (a) TEACHER GOVERN- 
MENT, (6) STUDENT GOVERNMENT. 
PRES. ROBERT H. WRIGHT, GREENVILLE, N. C, 
I rink one indictment that may with justice be made 
against our modern educational system is we have done too 
much surface plowing and not enough subsoiling. We are in 
an age of educational experimentation. Experiments, if prop- 
erly thought out before made, then fairly and honestly tested, 
add something to the sum total of knowledge on the subject. 
If, however, they are tested to prove some pet theory then they 
are pernicious.
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The idea that I am going to advance today has not been 
tested in all of its details. I do not claim that it is the 
panacea for all school ills. I do not claim that it is applicable 
to all schools or to all grades in a given school. I gave it a 
trial for nearly three years in a large city high school for girls, 
and can say of a truth that here it worked in a most satisfac- 
tory way as the City Superintendents, the teachers in the school 
and the students themselves will all attest. All who saw it 
work approved. 
The principles of government are fundamental. Whatever 
the form of government the public schools should instill into 
the students the principles of said government. As. Dr. Brum- 
baugh puts its, “The public school finds its chiefest defense, 
not in promoting the welfare of the individual, but the wel- 
fare of the State itself. Its first concern must be to equip 
each to codperate with his fellows and then, and not until 
then, shall it turn to the more individualistic task of fitting 
each one for the highest economic efficiency.” (Report of N. 
E. A., 1908, p. 84.) 
Our government is a democracy, adapted to a large territory, 
which gives us what is known as representative government. 
Since it is not possible for each individual to participate 
directly in all forms of governmental activities, we have a 
government of delegated powers. We delegate the law-mak- 
ing power to representatives of the people. With this form of 
government all laws grow out of the conscious or subcon- 
scious spirit of the people. Place a statute upon the books 
that meets with universal disapproval and your law becomes 
a dead letter. This you see is psychology. 
All principles of education must be laid on a psychological 
basis. In school administration we should at all times adjust 
ourselves to the psychology of the group to be governed. 
In young children the reasoning faculty is not developed. 
They do this or that because they are told to do it and do not 
question why. If they do not obey they should be made to, 
and for no other reason than because they have been told. 
They are selfish and act primarily on this basis. At this age 
a despotic form of government, even a tyranny, is best. They 
should be kept busy, told to do things and made to do what 
they are told. With such pupils any form of student govern- 
ment is, to my mined, ridiculous, absurd.
-P-A-G-E-125
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 125 
As they grow older, say at about the age of twelve to four- 
teen, at that age where boyhood begins to turn into manhood, 
the faculty to reason begins to develop and the social instinct 
makes itself felt in the life of each individual. At this stage 
of development the individual appreciates more than ever be- 
fore, and, in my judgment, more than ever again, the privilege 
of participating in any and every form of social or group 
activity. At this time in life we can use the laboratory method 
for teaching our idea of government with the most telling 
results. 
In early childhood through despotic government teach the 
child, in an unmistakable way, respect for authority and 
obedience to law, but with the quickening of the social instinct 
there should be a change in form of school government, and 
such a change that the child will find in the school govern- 
ment a fertile soil for individual growth. 
Now to our problem. Should this form of government be 
student government? I say unhesitatingly, no. I have no 
patience with student government; for it is not founded upon 
sound principles. I do not believe it exists anywhere; stu- 
dents in the grades are not sufficiently mature to establish 
and maintain a government that any sané educator would tol- 
erate. Without judgment or the social instinct, dominated 
with selfishness, it is impossible to evolve a code of laws that 
will regulate social activities. Like begets like. Unless there 
is a social instinct you can never get laws to govern social 
activities. So we conclude that for the earlier years student 
government is impossible. By student government I mean 
government by. students alone. 
Is this form of government possible for the adolescent? 
While we must admit that there is a psychological basis to 
build upon, yet it is not at all expedient. As the faculties are 
growing and developing they need direction and suggestion 
to help them develop properly. The student needs a wise 
counselor now more than ever before—more than ever after. 
At this age the ispe dixit theory should disappear and we 
should come and reason together. No longer should the pupil 
be forced to do, but he should be led to see and then he will do. 
Just as the tyrant should rule in the earlier years, so now the 
broad, open-minded, wise counselor should rule, but his rule
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should be by suggestion and not by might. To establish stu- 
dent government with this type of student is to fail to measure 
up to the greatest responsibility resting upon an educator; 
for at this age we do the best work for mature years. 
Should our form of government be faculty government? 
Not long ago I was talking with one of our leading educators. 
“When we reduce it to its last analysis,” he said, “all govern- 
ment in schools is faculty government.” I do not agree with 
this idea. If we wish to train in the most efficient way for 
citizenship, we must in some way, for the adolescent, have 
some form of government in which the student in a measure, 
at least participates. Faculty government smacks of the form 
of the government found in an aristocracy. The Czar and his 
nobles make the laws and the people obey them when they 
cannot violate them. How often do we find the laws of a 
school obeyed only when the student cannot violate them? 
When we stop to think the reason becomes apparent. The 
faculty, by delegating to itself the power to make the laws 
and the power to enforce the laws, also takes to itself all the 
responsibility and consequently all the conscience of the 
school. (What follows is for the adolescent.) 
The true solution to the problem, so it seems to me, is to 
be found in a combination of student government and faculty 
government in such a way that the student feels that he has 
an active part in the management of school affairs. This I 
term school government. 
The student body will see the wisdom of allowing the purely 
professional questions to remain with those who are especially 
prepared to solve such questions, if certain questions that con- 
cern only the student end are left to the students. Let me 
explain by giving a concrete example, one solved by the stu- 
dent. In the school in which we tried out this idea there was 
a gymnasium on the same floor with the lunch room. At 
noon some of the students wished to dance, others to prome- 
nade upon the floor. We had in this school representatives 
from each division of the school, elected by the students in the 
several groups. These representatives met with the principal 
in what we called a school council. In the council the ques- 
tion of dancing or promenading at noon came up. I told them 
this was a matter that concerned only their convenience, and
-P-A-G-E-127
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 127 
that I would abide by their decision. At first they voted that 
I say to the school that they, the students, are requested by 
the council not to promenade at noon. This was done. There 
was no definite law made by the council and the natural con- 
sequence followed. In a few days the dancing and promenad- 
ing began to conflict. At the next meeting of the council it 
was decided to refer the matter back to each division of the 
school for a vote. (This was done without any suggestion on 
my part.) As a result of the vote it was decided, at a call 
meeting of the council to hear the returns from the election, 
that all promenading should be stopped. When the results 
were announced to the school the next morning, they were 
given a talk on the initiative and referendum. They fully 
understood the meaning of the term, and the promenading 
ceased. There was never any more trouble. Here is a case 
that was of no concern to principal or faculty, only the student 
body was interested. On the other hand, the course of study, 
text books, methods of teaching and other matters of a pro- 
fessional nature were never brought up in the council. 
This form of government outlined above, styled by me school 
government, has many things in its favor. It lessens friction 
between the head of the school and the student body, between 
the teachers and the students; for it abolishes the “me and 
thou” and establishes in its stead a we. 
It makes the students feel a personal interest in the school 
and its welfare; for they see that they have any active part 
in making the school. They can point to things they have 
done. 
If the head of the school has in council with him a repre- 
sentative body of the students, by suggestion, he can have the 
students do many things that they would not do. For example, 
we had no faculty supervision over the corridors when the 
classes moved, neither did we have faculty supervision over 
the student body at the noon hour, and there was absolutely 
no need for such supervision. Our lunch room was indeed a 
model for neatness. The duties of the teachers are lightened 
along many of the lines of discipline, while at the same time 
the students are stimulated in self-discipline, self-control. 
It reveals to the teacher the student point of view, and thus 
enables him to do with intelligence many things that either
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
he would never do or do in ignorance. Many of the serious 
cases of discipline are due to the fact that the teacher is igno- 
rant of the student’s point of view. When the teacher knows 
how the student views the question, he is best able to handle 
properly the situation. I believe most of our troubles in school 
arise from ignorance on the part of the teacher. I have said 
that in nine out of ten cases of discipline the teacher is at 
fault. Not a fault of motive, but at fault nevertheless. 
It helps the head of the school to shape school spirit. The 
spirit of every school is good if properly directed, but it is 
quite difficult for principal or teacher to find an effective way 
of shaping it. Students are as fond of doing right as of doing 
wrong. If they can be rightly directed they will take pleas- 
ure in doing the proper thing. After this council had been 
in operation about a year the students, instead of hazing new 
students, without a suggestion from me, took pleasure in show- 
ing every attention to those first entering the school. It was 
the spirit of the school. It was clear that they had a personal 
interest in every individual in the school. 
I will stop. Had I the time and you the patience I could 
enumerate good effects coming from such an organization al- 
most indefinitely and give examples. 
The building was not defaced in the least; vulgarity on the 
part of the students was rooted out; the substitute teacher was 
treated with the greatest courtesy; students sat in rooms and 
worked without any one to supervise them; went to the library 
and worked without any one in the room but students; cheat- 
ing on examinations was practically eliminated, etc. 
This form of government is in accord with our national 
idea of government, consequently, when a student comes 
through such a school he goes forth into the community a bet- 
ter citizen with a truer, as well as a higher, ideal of our insti- 
tutions. He is better fitted for life. All school teaching 
should lead to better citizenship. This kind of training does 
this in the truest sense; for it leads the student to have less 
fear of, but more respect for, law. It reduces fear of law by 
showing him that law is based upon justice; when this is real- 
ized there naturally follows more respect for law. 
I end where I began, by saying this has not been thoroughly 
tested, but it has been tested in one school and found there 
most, satisfactory. It produced results.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
SOME SUGGESTIONS TOWARDS ENLARGING THE 
SCOPE OF LITERATURE-TEACHING IN 
THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
J. C. METCALF, PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH, RICHMOND COLLEGE, VA. 
Tue teacher of English in the high school finds himself en- 
gaged in the three-fold task of training boys and girls in prac- 
tical composition, in more or less formal grammar, and in 
esthetic appreciation. In this paper only the last division of 
this three-fold task need concern us; and so I venture several 
suggestions towards the enlargement of the scope of literature- 
teaching in the high school. Perhaps it would be more exact 
to say the enrichment of literature-teaching; for when it is a 
question of spiritual and artistic values we look for quality 
rather than extent. 
First, then, it seems to me that a further separation of litera- 
ture and composition is desirable, if we are to get satisfactory 
results in writing and in appreciation. I do not mean, of 
course, an absolute separation, for often there may be a vital 
relationship between the study of literature and the study of 
composition, certainly on the structural side; and whenever 
the one can give life and stimulus to the other the two should 
touch. What I should like to record my protest against, how- 
ever, is the substitution of outlines and flabby little character- 
sketches, based on some classic, for sincere and vital expres- 
sion in writing, imperfect though it may be, on some topic 
suggested by the pupil’s own experience or interested observa- 
tion. After all, boys and girls with keen eyes and curiosity 
can usually impart definite information on subjects in which 
they are undeniably interested, but to expect them to write 
original essays in literary criticism is merely to encourage 
literary priggishness, to say nothing of the moral aspect of the 
performance. 
My next suggestion logically follows: Extend the range of 
reading in the high school, both optional and required, by 
allowing substitutions and encouraging, within proper limits, 
individual taste. Through variety bring about flexibility and 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  1380 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
adaptability. This is, of course, more easily said than done, 
but it can and ought to be done. The teaching of English 
literature in most secondary schools is too mathematical and 
perfunctory. More flesh and blood, more color and fancy, are 
needed for the appealing interpretation of great poetry and 
prose, so that the pupil will go away from the class wanting 
more, instead of being persuaded that Milton and Gray and 
Shakespeare wrote classics for parsing exercises and as a 
hunting ground for classical allusions. Widen the range of 
reading; enlarge the freedom of choice; let the boys and girls 
read some books just for fun. Happily, the present entrance 
requirements allow more options than the old, and it is to be 
hoped that the future college entrance requirements will be 
more flexible still. Relatively few high school students will go 
to college anyhow, and we should not make a fetish of the 
entrance requirements... They are good, but there is other 
litrature equally as good, all things considered. 
My third suggestion is, that more attention be given to the 
study of the patriotic oration as literature. If there is one 
art in which, by common consent, the South has been pre- 
éminent it is oratory. Handy collections of classic orations 
of Southern statesmen and other publicists are now available 
for class study. Some boys will respond to the appeal of litera- 
ture in the form of great oratory who care little or nothing 
for poetry or the essay. One difficulty which the boy or girl— 
the boy oftener than the girl—frequently has with a piece of 
poetry, for instance, is his inability to visualize situations 
historically and emotionally remote, but an oration touching 
the history of his state or section of American life is usually 
warm with association. The oration as a literary form has 
not received proper recognition either in school or college. The 
popular nature of the oration, originally tested as it was by 
the ear, renders it in a peculiar sense suitable literature for 
high school study, particularly if sympathetically read aloud. 
The range of reading in the high school might be enlarged 
by the discriminating use of standard magazines. A magazine 
of high literary tone which illustrates literature in the mak- 
ing, like the Atlantic Monthly, and which has such a con- 
spicuous place in the history of American literature, is good 
material for the boy or girl in the last year of the high school.
-P-A-G-E-131
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. . 131 
This whole matter of magazine reading is one with which the 
teacher must deal sooner or later; and if he or she can make 
it an auxiliary in vitalizing the approach to literature, all the 
better. Under wisely competent direction I do not see why 
a certain amount of current magazine reading should not be 
credited in a school course. I wish every high school and col- 
lege boy in the South would read our two standard magazines, 
The South Atlantic Quarterly and The Sewanee Review. 
My next suggestion is: Reduce the amount of gossip about 
authors to zero and attention to the mere history of literature 
to a minimum, and increase the reading of poetry, drama, the 
essay, and the oration to a maximum; and don’t be over- 
critical. Far too much energy has been wasted on literary 
pathology under the guise of interest in literature, and often 
glib twaddle about periods and tendencies has caused the 
spiritual biographies of poets and essayists to become shelf- 
worn and not hand-worn. 
A further suggestion towards enlarging or enriching the 
teaching of literature is, that the teacher require more read- 
ing aloud, and that he read more frequently to his pupils. We 
have assumed that ability to answer questions in writing is the 
only evidence of fitness for advancement. This is a species of 
short-shightedness due, in part, to an application of the stand- 
ards of scientific judgment, essentially intellectual, to an art 
which appeals primarily to the emotions and the imagination, 
and in the appreciation of which the element of tone is almost 
essential. Children see so much poetry and hear so little that 
no wonder they want to know why the thing wasn’t written in 
prose where the sense wouldn’t all get lost in the general 
mixup of long and short lines! And that matter-of-fact notion 
that the sense is the main thing; indeed, the only thing of 
interest in poetry as in prose, gets fixed in the boy’s mind 
until he regards poetry as fantastic and weak, and, upon the 
whole, rather too feminine for the superior masculine mind. 
The young person should get much of his poetry through the 
ears as well as through the eyes. The truth is, we have sadly 
neglected the voice in our schools, and literary interpretation 
has correspondingly suffered. The mere reading aloud in a 
sympathetic tone of a great piece of poetry or cadenced prose, 
is sometimes better than an hour of comment. This is par-
-P-A-G-E-132
  182 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ticularly true in dramatic literature, which for young people is 
more or less confusing—an abiding evidence that really vital 
plays are intended to be heard. Visualize and vocalize! In 
these to commandments lies the secret of arousing youthful 
interest in dramatic literature and in other kinds as well. 
Maps and pictures and concrete descriptions of stage-settings 
ought to accompany the study of Shakespeare; and, whenever 
possible, the presentation once a year of a less difficult play or 
parts of a play. 
After all, the main thing is to cultivate a genuine love for 
great literature and to encourage the voluntary reading of it. 
Then boys and girls will without protest memorize passages 
which are vibrant with personality to them, and thus they 
will enrich their minds and spirits with the indwelling power 
of unseen presences. Of course, it is not to be inferred that I 
would favor the neglect of the purely intellectual element in 
literature-teaching, the thought-content of literature; for as- 
surredly we must have ballast for our enchanted boat and good 
steering-gear for our aeroplane. My purpose has been to urge 
greater freedom of movement for boat and aeroplane. 
Manifestly the two essentials for realizing the ambitions 
just set forth are, first, well-read teachers with appealing per- 
sonalities; and, second, libraries. Widely read teachers in 
vur secondary schools are, of course, rare; indeed, not numer- 
ous anywhere, but your teacher of English might be ever so 
widely read and fail miserably. It is safe to say, I think, that 
teachers of no other subject may come in closer contact with 
their pupils than teachers of English literature. With a 
kindly and tolerant knowledge of boy-nature and girl-nature, 
they must unite in some sort at least the prophetic function, 
rightly reading personal values in potential terms. They 
must have the inward vision or their work will perish. And as 
to libraries: there is no more important educational move- 
ment among us today than library extension. A good refer- 
ence library in every high school is a mere minimum of equip- 
ment; in addition to this there should be a good supply of 
standard literature and the better magazines, from which the 
pupil may supplement his knowledge of classroom classics. 
Boys and girls will learn to love books by association with 
books and not merely by prescription. It is the duty of every
-P-A-G-E-133
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 133 
teacher of English to help speed the day when every Southern 
boy and girl may have immediate access to the life-giving 
makers of our literature with their “wells of English unde- 
filed.”

SOME NEEDED ADDITIONS TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF 
EXPRESSION. 
ROBERT H. GAULT, PH. D., NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. 
Tue practical educator requires the advantage of all the 
forms of expression that may be made available. Spoken 
language and gesture are insufficient guides to mental content. 
Neither do they supply the most reliable indication of mental 
power and the possibilities. 
These forms of expression should be supplemented and the 
supplement must be supplied by those who are equipped to 
make clinical observations of children. The expression of 
mental states by vocal control and quality, and indications of 
ability and promise, such as appear in the physical develop- 
ment, especially of the cranium and face, must be sys- 
tematically described. They must be made available to the 
teachers in every grade. 
This new chapter in the psychology of expression must be 
worked out in our schools by teachers who are prepared to 
make clinical observations. To this end our normal schools 
and college departments of psychology and education should 
undertake the special preparation of teachers. Prospective 
teachers should be made familiar with normal and abnormal 
characteristics of physical development. They should make 
physical measurements for themselves as well as study the 
work of others. If such exercises can be wisely practiced we 
may expect to develop a generation of teachers who, judging 
from developmental signs as well as from verbal expressions, 
may adopt pedagogical means to the end of education.

SOME COLLEGE IDEALS. 
BY PRESIDENT WILLIAM A. WEBB, CENTRAL COLLEGE, FAYETTE, MO. 
Or all the educational problems that have been pressing for 
solution upon the conscience of the American nation during 
the past two decades, none, perhaps, has received more care- 
ful consideration than the one which embraces the position, 
function, and ultimate destiny of the American college. Dur- 
ing this period the college has been sorely beset. In spite of 
the fact that its whole history is fraught with self-sacrificing 
devotion to high and holy ideals, and that its achievements 
represent the largest and richest contribution of any of our 
educational institutions to the higher life of the nation, it has 
more than once been called before the bar of public opinion 
and compelled to show cause why its work might not be given 
to other educational institutions and itself consigned to the 
category of outworn and useless organisms. 
I.—THE NEED OF A DEFINITION, 
The lack of some working definition or other device for de- 
termining the metes and bounds of the real college has been 
one of the most fruitful sources of demoralization in the past. 
Not having a generally accepted or easily applied standard of 
measurement, the general public has made little effort to draw 
sharp lines of distinction between the high schools and the 
colleges, and has been entirely too willing to accept all col- 
leges at their own valuation. This condition is possibly due 
to the fact that during the period of organization of our col- 
leges there existed neither a strong central authority nor an 
intelligent public opinion sufficiently vigorous to make itself 
felt in determining the rank and character of the individual 
colleges. In the absence of any authoritative supervision of 
private institutions of learning, each college was permitted to 
establish itself on standards of scholarship subject in too many 
cases only to the whims and caprices of its immediate founders. 
But during the past two decades several forces have been at 
work bringing about a better state of affairs. In place of the
-P-A-G-E-135
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 185 
isolation of former years, the better grade of colleges working 
in harmony with the high schools on the one hand and the 
universities on the other have been uniting into organizations 
whose purposes included raising entrance requirements, ele- 
vating standards of schoarship, and further advancing the gen- 
eral cause of education by disseminating correct views and 
sane ideas about the equipment, fields of labor, and ends and 
aims of the several institutions of learning devoted to the 
cause of higher education. 
II.—SOME HELPFUL AGENCIES, 
(a) Associations of preparatory schools and colleges. 
(b) The classification by the religious denominations of the 
educational institutions under their auspices. 
(c) The Carnegie Foundation for the advancement of teach- 
ing; especially its definition of a standard college. 
III.—THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE COLLEGE. 
A general recognition of the dignity, worth, and standing 
of the college will necessarily bring about a new adjustment 
of a large number of so-called colleges. Many of these institu- 
tions will find that they can serve the cause of education to 
better advantage by frankly becoming first class high schools 
or academies, or perhaps junior colleges; and others fortified 
by a definite statement of conditions will be enabled by means 
of successful appeals to their constituency to enlarge their 
equipment and to raise their requirements for admission and 
graduation to the measure of efficiency demanded by an en- 
lightened public opinion. And so in the long process of time 
the American college, with its roots running back into the 
soil of English culture, with more than a century of honorable 
history behind it, is fast coming to its own. When once the 
public recognizes that the college as an institution of higher 
learning maintains a four years’ course of study, superim- 
posed upon a four years’ high school course; that it is con- 
ducted by a competent corps of trained and experienced 
teachers, under conditions that furnish them adequate equip- 
ment for doing faithfully and well what they profess to do; 
that its entrance requirements are strictly enforced, and that
-P-A-G-E-136

186 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
its standards of scholarship are universally recognized, then 
will all questions of its supercedure or partition be forever 
disposed of, and it will take its place as the very queen of our 
educational institutions. The standardization of the Ameri- 
can college, therefore, makes for both its integrity and per- 
manency, and however much it may have deserved the criticism 
to which it has been subjected during the process of the transi- 
tion from the old-fashioned type of the past to the modern 
college of today, there is little to indicate that it has lost the 
respect and affection of intelligent people as the most success- 
ful instrument yet devised for the purpose of conducting the 
youth of the land into cultured and useful citizenship. 
IV.—ITS PRESENT FUNCTION. 
As in the past, the college must continue to cherish in the 
minds of our choicest youth those ideals of intellectual and 
spiritual life which are the chief glory of a nation. In spite 
of the insistent demands of a practical age, the college in the 
future, as in the past, will continue to stress those subjects 
which are cultural rather than those that are usually denomi- 
nated professional or vocational. This does not mean that the 
college course is to be unnecessarily limited or restricted; on 
the contrary the modern college will gladly welcome subjects 
of instruction drawn from any field of human knowledge pro- 
vided always that competent instructors and adequate equip- 
ment are at hand to furnish the instruction, and provided fur- 
thermore that these subjects are calculated to expand the 
vision, discipline, the intellect, and broaden the spiritual sym- 
pathies of its students. 
V.—PLACE OF PERSONALITY. 
This then is the end and aim of the college course—to instill 
great and noble ideals into the youth of the land in order that 
they may make them prevail in the every day affairs of human 
life. And just here is where the college has a fine advantage 
over its most dangerous competitor, the undergraduate depart- 
ments of the big universities. It is universally admitted that 
culture, especially that culture which reaches its finest flower 
in the Christian ideal of service, can be best inculeated by per-
-P-A-G-E-137
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 137 
sonal contact with great and noble teachers. Of all our insti- 
tutions of higher learning, the college is the most dependent 
upon the personality of its instructors for accomplishing the 
work for which it is set. If its purpose is to maintain from 
age to age the “continuity of culture” in order that it may 
render large and efficient service to mankind, it is essential 
that the work of the college be placed as far as possible in the 
hands of men whose scholarship indeed is above reproach, but 
whose highest distinction lies in their capacity for inspiring 
the youth of their classes with their own superb devotion to the 
truths of science, to the glories of the humanities, and to the 
ideals of Christian citizenship. “Rich personality and human 
sympathy and insight plus scholarship,” says President But- 
ler, “is the formula for a great college teacher.”

SOME RECENT SCHOOL POLICIES IN VIRGINIA. 
CHAS. G. MAPHIS, PRESIDENT STATH BOARD OF EXAMINERS, CHAR- 
LOTTSVILLE, VA. 
By recent school policies I do not mean to convey the idea 
that all the policies I mention are new and different from 
those found anywhere else. They are comparatively new to 
Virginia, so far as usage goes, and some of them differ some- 
what from the laws and regulations of any other State. 
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
Probably the most important is the change in the method 
of electing the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
In 1902 a new Constitution went into effect in Virginia, under 
the wise provisions of which the changes I shall note were 
made possible. 
Under the old Constitution the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction was elected by the Legislature, and was almost 
always chosen from the membership of that body, and almost 
as frequently without any special reference to his fitness and 
training for the position.
-P-A-G-E-138
    188 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In 1905 the first Superintendent under the new Constitution 
was nominated in a State primary and elected by a vote of the 
people. He is a well-trained, able, energetic and enthusiastic 
school man, and the remarkable results obtained by his admin- 
istration of the office fully demonstrate the wisdom of the 
change. He was re-elected this year without opposition in his 
own party. 
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION, 
What the heart is to the circulatory system a good, strong 
State Board of Education is to a school system—a source of 
life and power, vigor and strength, health and activity. 
Under the old system the State Board of Education con- 
sisted of the Governor, Attorney-General, and Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, the first two, elected by the people, and 
the other selected, as above mentioned, by the Legislature. 
The Board, of course, was political in character. Its powers 
were great. It elected all the Superintendents, selected all the 
text books, made regulations for the government of the 
schools, ete. 
The new Constitution provides for, and we now have, an 
educational State Board of Education, which consists of the 
three officers named above, all elected by the people, one mem- 
ber from each of three State educational institutions, to be 
nominated by the Board of Visitors of the institution and 
elected by the Legislature, and one city and one County 
School Superintendent, to be selected by the six members of 
the Board provided for as indicated. These two members do 
not have a voice in the selection of other Superintendents. 
The Board as at present constituted has very large powers. 
It selects Superintendents, adopts text books, makes regula- 
tions which have the effect of statute law when published, ap- 
points School Examiners and Inspectors, etc. Much authority 
is centralized in this Board, but, so far, it has used it wisely 
anc the schools have prospered under its direction. 
STATE BOARD OF EXAMINERS. 
The State Board of Education, realizing the value of expert 
supervision, in 1905 took the first and very advanced step in 
that direction by appointing a State Board of Examiners and
-P-A-G-E-139
  
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 139 
Inspectors, consisting of five members, who should con- 
stitute a sort of cabinet for the Board. Their office is 
a kind of educational house. The Board prepares all exami- 
nation questions, grades all papers, issues all certificates, and 
has full authority in all matters pertaining to the certifica- 
tion ef teachers, subject, of course, to the approval of the 
State Board of Education. In addition to this specific duty, 
the members of this Board, who have general supervision 
over twenty counties each, act as field agents of the Department 
of Education, visit, advise and co-operate with Division Super- 
intendents and other school officials, conduct teachers’ meet- 
ings, organize leagues, address public educational meetings, 
establish and inspect high schools, and perform various other 
duties. 
This Board is probably unique, but the results of its work 
have justified its existence and it has been retained. Promi- 
nent educators who have watched it have declared that its 
appointment was the most progressive educational step taken 
by any Southern State. 
EXPERT SUPERVISION. 
The work of the Examiners demonstrated the value of bet- 
ter supervision, so that the General Assembly of 1908 passed a 
minimum salary law for Division Superintendents of Schools, 
which provides a minimum salary of $900 and permits counties 
to supplement this amount. 
This act revolutionized the system of county and city super- 
vision and put it upon what is essentially an expert basis. 
Formerly a Superintendent’s principal occupation was that of 
a lawyer, doctor, farmer, or business man, and he incidentally 
looked after the schools. He could not afford to do otherwise, 
as the minimum salary was $200 and the average salary $400. 
The minimum is now $700, and in most instances $900, and 
many of the larger counties are now paying from $1,000 to 
$1,800. Except in but few instances the Superintendents are 
now giving all of their time to the schools. In the last ap- 
pointment, July, 1909, forty-three new men were chosen, 
nearly all of whom were trained school men, and already many 
evidences of improvement are not lacking.

SCHOOL BUILDING ACT. 
Another measure which has benefited the schools as much 
as any other, and one which in some features at least is origi- 
nal with Virginia, is the School Building Act, by which school 
districts may borrow money belonging to the literary fund for 
ihe purpose of erecting schoolhouses. 
Other States have had loan funds, but they have consisted 
of special appropriations set aside for this purpose. The Vir- 
ginia plan is unique in that it utilizes the literary fund which 
is already a school fund, and makes it double duty as it were— 
the income going toward the support of the schools and the 
principal being loaned to them. 
AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS, 
The efforts of the Department of Public Instruction have all 
been directed toward giving to the country boy and girl, as 
far as practicable, equality of educational opportunity, and 
toward making the instruction which they are to receive fit, 
and fashion them for an enriched country life. With this end 
in view ten agricultural high schools—one in each Congres- 
sional District—have been established where agriculture and 
domestic arts are taught. 
NORMAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Normal Training Departments have been established in 
twenty selected rural high schools, and in connection with 
them much extension work of a supervisory nature is done. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
One hundred thousand dollars is appropriated annually for 
Special State Aid for High Schools with the result that they 
have increased from 74 in 1905 to 315 in 1909. Of course all 
of these are not full four-year high schools. A large number 
of them do but two years of high school work, but they give to 
the country child that much additional opportunity. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
Ten district summer institutes are held each year for four 
weeks for the Elementary School Teachers and the University  
-P-A-G-E-141
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 141 
of Virginia Summer School is conducted for six weeks, and 
offered courses for advanced students. 
Out of about 9,000 teachers in the State, over 4,000 attended 
summer schools in 1909. 
CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSPORTATION, 
The consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils 
have received much attention and gratifying results have been 
obtained. There are nearly 200 school wagons in use this 
year. In 1905 there were 19. 
LIBRARIES, 
Two school library systems are in operation—a traveling 
library system, consisting now or over 200 libraries, and one 
which provides that in each district where the community 
raises fifteen dollars, the District trustees must give a like 
amount and the State ten dollars—making a total of $40. The 
State contracts for the books at reduced cost. During the 
present year 300 libraries, none costing less than $40 were 
established.

THE ETHICAL FUNCTION OF THE COLLEGE. 
JOHN PRESTON M’CONNELL. 
Professor of History and Economics, Bmory and Henry College, Virginia. 
In the discharge of its ethical function the college is not to 
follow the people, but to lead them; not to reflect public ethics, 
but to direct it. It is, of course, true that the standards and 
aims of the college must not be so remote from the people that 
an impassable gulf yawns between the two, nevertheless the 
college is to lead and not to follow. 
It is incumbent upon the college to impress upon the stu- 
dents that the power they acquire in college is to be used as a 
trust held for society; that the only ethical use of power of 
any kind is that which leaves society richer and stronger in all 
its essentials, and that the personal exercise of power unless 
imbued with this ethical conception makes the strong man too 
often a social bandit.
-P-A-G-E-142
  
142 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Intelligence without conscience is more perilous to society 
than vicious ignorance. The power of the latter is small; its 
appearance repulsive; its method crude and generally easily 
guarded against. The power of the former is great; its method 
shrewd and insinuating; its influence is almost unlimited. 
It is suicidal for society, through the college, to place in the 
hands of a trained man the vast power and stores of knowl- 
edge accumulated through the centuries, unless this man is 
made to feel that he is merely a trustee of this power, which it 
is treason to the human race to use for purely personal ends to 
the hurt of society. 
The college, therefore, is to impress upon the young man who 
goes forth from its walls that he is to be as careful of his 
duties as he is of his rights. Hundreds clamor for a recogni- 
tion of all their rights by others where one insists on being 
allowed to discharge all his duties to others. The truly ethical 
are as zealous for their duties as for their rights. 
The college that is true to its duties appeals to the imagina- 
tion of the young man within its gates. The spirit of the insti- 
tution possesses him. He, as it were, hears voices in the air 
inviting him to a heroic life. He is lifted above the narrow 
prejudices of country or age. With imagination fired and the 
emotions touched by the inspiration of such an ideal, he cannot 
live a narrow or craven life. He leaves college socialized, not 
with an age or group, but with all ages and the human race. 
He understands and recognizes the debt of the present to the 
past and its obligation to the future. Such an attitude of 
mind enriches the college man with the most varied and ele- 
vated enjoyments, and, at the same time, makes him the most 
willing and efficient in social service. 
The so-called “practical man” contents himself with,a suc- 
cessful career according to the ideas and stands of the society 
around him. The ethical idealist aspires to a life as it could 
be in a society as it should be; consequently the college that is 
ture to its function cultivates the idealism of the students, and 
rationally and discreetly appropriating the real of the present 
unceasingly molds it for the ideal of the future. 
A truly ethical conception of our relations enlarges the un- 
derstanding, clarifies the judgment, and gives sweep and vision 
and purpose to the life. The highly trained man without this
-P-A-G-E-143
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 148 
sense of his relation to society is a “social pirate,’ and with 
no uplift face to catch the glow of the radiant future for the 
race, he sails the sea of life under a banner bearing the legend, 
“T owe no man anything.” If the college is unfaithful to its 
duty the coherent and constructive forces of society are de- 
stroyed and the bonds of social order broken. 
Moralized education only gives unwavering purpose and un- 
flagging effort for the constructive tendencies and ideals of 
society in the hours that try men’s lives. This only gives social 
coherence and national immortality. The rich, the warlike, 
and the esthetic nations soon pass off the stage of the world’s 
drama unless ethical conceptions permeate and invigorate the 
national life. The races and nations that have perished have not 
fallen for lack of material goods or intellectual training or 
esthetic culture, but for lack of deeply-planted ethical stand- 
ards amongst leaders and people. 
How shall the college develop this sense of ethical obligation 
and relation is a difficult question. Formal ethical instruction 
accomplishes something, nevertheless few college men will say 
that the text-book and formal instruction in ethics influenced 
their lives as deeply as did the indirect influences. The col- 
lege owes the student no given quantity of ethical informa- 
tion, the quality of the ethical training is the important mat- 
ter. Ethical knowledge acquired by formal or informal in- 
struction is powerless as a force in life unless it is vivified by 
emotion. Knowledge is not so much a fortress against evil as 
is the unreasoned instinctive will to do the right thing. It is 
not so important to teach the student what to do and what not 
to do, as to inspire him with the desire to do right. Possessed 
by this feeling, he will often be perplexed as to what duty re- 
quires, but, so long as he is controlled by this principle, he may 
stumble; but he has not lost the direction of his life, and his 
character is safe. 
It will not be out of place to suggest and briefly to discuss 
some of the indirect means of ethical culture open to the 
college. 
The organization of the sports and play can be made of such 
a character as to elevate the ethical standards, not only of the 
players, but of all the students in the college. As regards the 
ethical effects, the game played is not so important as the 
spirit in which it is played.
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The orderly administration, the punctuality, the regularity, 
the atmosphere and traditions of our best conducted colleges 
are effective ethical influences that can scarcely be overesti- 
mated. 
Studies that deal with human life and progress have most 
influence in the ethical development of the student. History, 
literature, and the social sciences have special value. In these 
studies the young college man becomes conscious that human 
progress has been through a struggle; that evil has opposed 
advance in all the ages, but certain great principles have bound 
men together and given them strength and courage in the con- 
tests of the past. 
There is a strong moral instinct in young men which it is 
not difficult to reach and quicken before the callousness of age 
comes upon them. At this period it is easy to create a moral 
indignation against all that is mean or sordid in private or 
public life. In fact, some of the ancient sages believed that the 
chief function of the teacher is to inspire the young with a 
love of the good and an abhorrence of the bad. Too often the 
alumnus who has achieved wealth, position, or fame, is pointed 
out by the college authorities as successful, regardless of how 
he won and used his wealth or position. 
Wise courses in civics and politics arouse a civic pride and 
make the student, not only a good man, but a good citizen, as 
willing to live for his country in peace as to die for her in war. 
The college man must not be allowed to feel that he, as a 
member of a favored caste, is lifted above the ordinary re- 
straints and obligations that bind other men. 
Every college should require a formal course in ethics. 
Moreover, the college must recognize that the ethical must be 
reinforced by a vital religious faith and reverence. It is pretty 
generally conceded that an ethical system without a religious 
basis does not accomplish much. 
The personality of the teaching force is by far the most im- 
portant single influence in the life of the college student. 
Members of college and university faculties were more often 
selected for personality and strength of character in times past 
than today. The present is the day of the specialist. This 
has its dangers. The association and example of a strong man 
with a sound education who sees life’s problems clearly is
-P-A-G-E-145
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 145 
a more wholesome and stimulating influence .on the under- 
graduate than is the mere specialist who knows more of his 
subject and often little or nothing of life and its problems. 
The college will call into her service men of commanding 
personality and character combined with the most thorough 
scholarship if she can be made to appreciate the tremendous 
significance of such men in the life of students. 
No single thing so enables the college effectively to dis- 
charge, not only its ethical function, but all its manifold 
functions, as to call into its teaching force men of command- 
ing personality and character who are, at the same time, 
trained scholars.

THE NEED OF AN OFFICIAL DEFINITION OF 
THE COLLEGE. 
J. D. RODEFFER, PH. D. 
Professor of German and French, Roanoke College, Salem, Va. 
Tue various states of the Union have in most instances 
been so eager to welcome into the field of education all comers 
who have made fair promises that charters have been granted 
under the name “college” to business schools, technological 
institutes, professional schools, academies, high schools, and 
even to persons who professed to give instruction through 
correspondence. In some parts of the country the old tradi- 
tional conception of the college as an institution where the 
student for the A. B. degree may secure a liberal education 
together with a broad culture has been replaced by loose 
notions proceeding from schools that are in reality not 
colleges. 
At the present time there is in use in the South, so far as 
I am informed, no legal definition of the term “college” or 
“aniversity.” As a consequence schools are being founded 
under these names without being required to give any guar- 
anty whatever as to the maintenance of a proper college or 
university standard. However, down to the present, no 
Southern State has placed itself in the unenviable position 
of Ohio, which in October, 1908, had fifty-two colleges and 
10
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
universities that grant college degrees. Of these, twenty- 
two are members of the Ohio College Association, which 
requires at least thirteen units for admission to the freshman 
year. 
In Virginia two institutions have recently been chartered, 
one under the name college, the other under that of university. 
In both instances there was no guaranty given as to the main- 
tenance of a college standard, and, whereas, in the one case 
an amount of capital stock not specified had been subscribed, 
in the other, which is that of the institution chartered under 
the more ambitious name, there was no capital stock at all. 
How is such a state of things possible? The answer is found 
in the Virginia statute regulating the incorporation of col- 
leges, which, being a part of the Revised Statutes of 1902-3-4, 
may be assumed to be of the better type of such laws. It is 
found in Pollard’s Code, ch. 46a, p. 551. 
“See. 1105d. Incorporation of colleges, associations, cemetery com- 
panies, fraternal associations, societies, etc., in which no capital is 
required. 
“(1) By executing, filing and recording a certificate as hereinafter, in 
sections 2 and 3 of this chapter, set forth, any number of persons not less 
than three, may, under the provisions and subject to the requirements of 
this act, associate to incorporate a college, an alumni association, a fra- 
ternal benefit association, society, order, or lodge, a society for the pre- 
vention of cruelty to children, a society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals, a charitable or benevolent association, or social, hunting, fishing 
club, or any society, association, or organization of a like or similar 
nature, in which no capital stock is required, or to be issued; provided, 
however, the provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize 
the incorporation of any church or religious denomination.” 
As long as a college may be incorporated under the same 
conditions as a “fishing club, or any society, association, or 
organization of a like or similar nature,” we may expect that 
the term will be abused. 
The name college in most of the States of the Union lacks 
dignity for the same reason that it lacks precision: there have 
been few attempts at an official definition of the word. The 
definition adopted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching, borrowed from the Revised Statutes of 
New York State, should be made the basis of all future legisla- 
tion on this point.

“An institution to be ranked as a college must have at least 
six professors, giving their entire time to college and univer- 
sity work, a course of four full years in liberal arts and 
sciences, and should require for admission not less than the 
usual four years of academic or high-school preparation, or its 
equivalent, in addition to the pre-academic or grammar school 
studies. 
“A technical school, to be eligible, must have entrance and 
graduation requirements equivalent to those of the college, and 
must offer courses in pure and applied science of equivalent 
grade.

ductive endowment of not less than two hundred thousand 
dollars.”

THE STATE LIBRARY. 
MISS CORNELIA SHAW, DAVIDSON, N. C. 
As has been stated, the State library came into being when 
books were few and expensive. An enactment for its early pro- 
tection in one of our foremost States, describes its limitation: 
“No book or publication shall at any time be taken out of the 
library for any purpose.” 
Railroads had not cobwebbed the country, bringing scat- 
tered peoples into neighborhood intimacy. While the libraries 
were supposed to be established for the use of the government 
and the people, the former for many years alone had access to 
the State’s collections of books. 
A recent novel pictures the meeting of its two main charac- 
ters in a so-called State library, under the eaves of the State- 
house, dusty, dark, and deserted, which was closed except dur- 
ing the meetings of the Legislature. The evolution of the 
library from this fossil stage has brought about more emphasis 
on the latter half of the original description, “For the use of 
the government and the people.” It is still a valued assistant 
to State officials, and should carry on its shelves the best and 
latest books published that relate to the science of government. 
At the same time, in a few States, it realizes its responsibility  
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
in being the book center of the whole State, and is proving its 
right to live, out of the pockets of the tax-payers, by supplying 
tools for the many as well as for the few. 
Legislative reference work, whether done by the department 
created for this work, or, as in most cases, assumed by the 
library staff, has, since Mr. Dewey blazed the way, in this 
special line of service as far back as 1892, proved its worth in a 
hundred legislative sessions. When the members of an incom- 
ing Legislature are notified that the library in the capital is 
prepared to furnish information on any proposed legislation, 
promptly, they will, if they are wise in their generation, cer- 
tainly to the benefit of the State at large, avail themselves of 
such bibliographic and expert assistance as are offered. For 
this work there must be a good law library, a large number of 
government documents, a well-developed sociological depart- 
ment, with extensive files of records, bills, etc., from other 
State Legislatures. Concrete cases of success or failure of a 
proposed amendment are of more value than countless theories. 
Special committees on social reform, financial conditions, edu- 
cational interests, etc., should be kept in mind, and card in- 
dexes, envelopes of clippings, collections of pamphlets, and 
bibliographies on the various subjects prepared for their use. 
The matter chosen should be non-partisan and non-political, 
and while the Legislature is not in session, it can be placed at 
the service of economic students, colleges, and universities. 
By being added to constantly the information is kept abreast 
of the hour, and should cover the whole field of public life. 
Twelve States report a system of traveling libraries, one 
showing a circulation of 40,000 volumes in one year. In Cali- 
fornia 275 communities, and in Virginia 67, receive these citi- 
zens’ libraries. The work is, I understand, entirely separate 
from the school libraries furnished in many States. The books 
are chosen for men and women who, failing to have books at 
home, look to the commonwealth for this helping hand. Cali- 
fornia makes an appropriation for the transportation of its 
books, but in most of the other States this expense is met by 
the borrowers. At least one traveling library should be made 
up of books relating to the State’s history, for the few calls 
that will come for it. In the others, political science, sociology, 
history, biography, with some wisely chosen fiction, make up
-P-A-G-E-149

an excellent collection, and it in reality becomes a small train- 
ing school for citizenship among the isolated people. In some 
States this work is under the guidance of the State Library 
Commission; in others, it is one of the priviliges of the State 
librarian. The books are sent out at the request of a small 
number of tax-payers, and are kept from three to six months, 
when they are returned and a fresh selection is made. 
The many study and debating clubs naturally look to the 
State library for suggestions as to systematic work, and they 
should be able to procure sets of books for short courses of 
study. In New York over half a thousand clubs are registered 
as doing ten weeks’ study on approved subjects, and to assist 
them 18,568 books were sent out in one year. In aiding the 
research workers of the State and nation a golden means 
must be established between furnishing assistance to the stay- 
at-home student and the one who prefers to work in the library 
and comes to it for study. In practically all cases this can be 
maintained by the librarian, if he is not hampered by too much 
red-tape or too many iron-bound rules. His common sense will 
enable him to determine the relative importance of rival claim- 
ants. A man or woman who wants books of the State library 
variety is in practically every instance a man or woman to be 
trusted, but if it is deemed unwise to send out books on indi- 
vidual application, then it should be possible for any one to 
procure them through local libraries, Judges of Superior 
Courts, Justices of the Peace, Notaries, etc. Dictionaries and 
encyclopedias, of course, remain on the shelf for the daily use 
of the library staff, but all other books should. be allowed to go 
out for varying lengths of time, subject to return on call. 
Printed rules of lending and forms of application lessen the 
labor of this department and safeguard it also. 
Those libraries that furnish books for the blind (which can 
be sent postage free), are entering into a field of helpfulness 
which appeals to every one. What is said of the physically 
blind can be said with added force to the mentally and morally 
deficient. The State reformatory and the State prisons and 
farms should receive from the State library, for Sunday read- 
ing, such books as will build the inmates in manliness and 
efficiency. The State hospitals should be privileged and en- 
couraged to draw from it for such of their patients as can use
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
books to advantage. Our defective and dependent citizens 
form an appreciable part of our population and we owe them 
far more than food and shelter. 
These things cost money and time and patience. They are 
tremenduously worth while, but they will not come in adequate 
measure till our lawmakers are more liberal in appropriations, 
and until librarians catch a vision of the possibilities that lie 
before them. So much depends upon the librarian himself that 
appropriations will be slow to come till his enthusiasm infects 
the voters of the commonwealth. He must be chosen, not be- 
cause he fought for his country, or because he “likes books.” 
I am using “he” advisedly, for it is best, I am sure, to have a 
man at the helm—a man of scholarship willing to work over- 
time. Cultivated judgment and commonsense, a pleasing pres- 
ence, and the ability to establish friendly relations with State 
officials, and all the State’s institutions are needful. He 
should have experimental knowledge of good libraries, and be 
able to choose his co-workers solely with regard to fitness and 
expert ability; he ought to be the court of final appeal in book 
selection, and he should have the widest latitude in the matter 
of lending books to the four corners of the earth, if they are 
needed for research work. In the State library system the 
natural head is the librarian. By going personally to educa- 
tional centers he can foster a spirit of codperation and con- 
fidence, and ally himself thoroughly with library interests. In 
that great day of the future, when every county shall have a 
storehouse for books, and likewise every school district, the 
State library will represent to the State what the national 
library represents to the nation. 
In the sea-coast States of the South, including Virginia and 
Texas, the State appropriations for 1908 were $50,650; the 
amount available and used for purchases was only $11.818, 
while $29,906 was paid in salaries. The number of bound vol- 
umes in the same territory was 432,419, not including law 
libraries. Some of our States spend as little as $250 per year 
for new books. 
Mr. J. I. Wyer, of the New York State Library, has sum- 
marized the argument for State-wide activities as follows: 
“It is as sound public educational policy that the State 
library should extend its work to cover the State, as that the
-P-A-G-E-151
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS: 151 
State University should admit students from the whole State, 
and not only from the town in which it is located. 
“It is a sound economic truism that one organization, prop- 
erly constituted and administered, can work more effectively 
than many in the same field. 
“It is expedient that library work workers look to greater 
consolidation and codperation before the lack of these charac- 
teristics becomes so noticeable as to draw the attention of the 
governing bodies.” 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPHR.] 
THE BEST DIRECTIONS FOR IMMEDIATE EDUCA- 
TIONAL EFFORT. 
PRESIDENT CHARLES W. ELIOT. 
Turee distinct tendencies in regard to popular education 
are to be observed all over the country, and at every stage of 
education from the lowest to the highest: 
One of these tendencies is towards a more careful and 
thorough training of the senses, and a greater consequent reli- 
ance for educational effect upon doing things with the hand 
and eye or the entire body, or in the language of the psychol- 
ogists, on setting up, in response to stimulation through the 
senses, habitual reactions of the motor nerves of expression 
and performance. This tendency is exhibited in the develop- 
ment at the different stages of education of hand and eye train- 
ing, farm work, shop work, and laboratory work in the 
sciences; that is, of varied activities on the part of the pupil. 
All good teachers desire not only to make impressions on their 
pupils, but to win from them habitual expressions motived and 
guided from within. All sorts of manual training schools, 
farm schools, trade schools, mechanic arts high schools, and 
technical or scientific schools result from the development of 
this tendency ; and in general from bottom to top of the educa- 
tional system bookwork is now held to be insufficient, and. 
other means are sought to train the senses and the mind. 
The second tendency is to adapt education at every stage, 
primary, secondary, or advanced, to the working lives of the 
people. Professional educators now-a-days are not content to
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
plan a general training, supposed to be adapted to all children 
of adolescents, whatever their future occupations are to be. 
They think it important to train at every stage of education 
faculties which will contribute in the future directly to the 
earning of the livelihood; and, inasmuch as no motive, acting 
within the child or the adolescent itself, prompts so strongly 
to earnestness and ardor in school work as a belief that its 
school studies are going to contribute to make its work more 
productive and its condition in life better, when it begins to 
earn money, they desire to set in operation as early as possible 
during the school life of the child the motive of the life career. 
This sound motive can create a wholesome interest in school 
work before the close of the primary or elementary period, and 
will remain the most effective inducement to hard work 
throughout the longest course of education. In professional 
schools, to be sure, a vague desire for the cultivation of the 
mind, and for the attainment of those powers of enjoyment 
which come through prolonged mental training has during the 
Jast hundred years often been presented as a sufficient motive 
for assiduity in youthful studies, but this motive, though real 
and available for a small minority, particularly in the higher 
stages of education, is not strong and common motive with the 
great mass of children and adolescents. They need to feel that 
there is an intimate connection between the processes of their 
education and their own future means of earning a livelihood. 
As a rule their personal interest in their own education can- 
not be maintained, unless a close connection between school 
work and the work of after life is plainly visible to them. It 
is this lack of conviction on the part of children and their 
parents concerning any close connection between school work 
and the subsequent means of livelihood which explains in part 
the facts that a large majority of American children never en- 
ter a secondary school, and that of those who do enter a secon- 
dary school, a large majority do not finish the course. There 
is a very general movement in all parts of the country to dis- 
cover and apply the means of adapting popular education to 
the working lives of the people, and to make effective with both 
parents and children the motive of the life career. 
The third tendency in regard to popular education is to pay 
more and more attention to the individual, to endeavor to de-
-P-A-G-E-153

velop each individual child’s capacity, to preesnt to each child 
that motive for exertion which appeals most readily to its feel- 
ings, desires, or capacities, and to supply to each child educa- 
tional material as fast as the child can appropriate it, so that 
the quick and ready child shall be just as fully occupied in 
school as the slow or plodding one. In accordance with this 
tendency, instruction addressed to the individual, or to a small 
group of individuals, and not to a large class, is more and 
more the standard or goal of intelligent teachers and am- 
bitious School Superintendents. In schools, colleges, and uni- 
versities, the best good of the individual scholar is the ultimate 
aim. This individualization obtains most in the higher stages 
of instruction, but it is to be observed all the way down to the 
primary school and the kindergarten. Every school and every 
college now-a-days wants to be judged by what it can do for 
the best scholars, rather than by what it does for the poorest, 
or for the average. This is genuine democracy in free schools. 
This is the way to carry into effect the democratic maxim— 
every career open to talent. 
In the Southern States there is even more reason than there 
is in the Northern and Western States for the keenest atten- 
tion to these comparatively new views concerning efficient 
popular education. The Southern States have undergone 
within the last forty years an extraordinary industrial and 
social revolution. A great diversifying of industries has taken 
place, and this novel diversity has not only increased the pres- 
ent wealth of the South, but gives promise of creating immense 
wealth in the near future, and a pressing demand for all sorts 
of intelligent and skilled labor. An agricultural country, 
which formerly relied upon a narrow range of crops and the 
erudest and least economical forms of human labor, is becom- 
ing a country of very diversified field and garden crops, and of 
numerous manufacturing, mining, and transportation indus- 
tries. It already utilizes a much greater variety of skilled 
labor than ever before; and in particular, its diversified agri- 
cultural products demand more skillful farming than ever be- 
fore. In order that it may play its new part, the whole South- 
land needs, more than any other part of the country, to take 
hold of these modern problems of training the mind through 
bodily activities, of adapting popular education at all its
-P-A-G-E-154

stages to the working lives of the people, and of making in- 
struction and guidance individual. 
The problem of profitable popular education in the South is, 
however, much more complicated than the same problem in the 
North and West, because of the presence of millions of persons 
of African descent whose ancestors were for generations bar- 
barians and slaves, and of other millions of whites, whose en- 
vironment, traditions, and habits, have been unfavorable to 
the development and general utilization of good schools. More- 
over, the existence in the South for many generations of the 
institution of African slavery prevented the recognition by the 
mass of the people, both white and colored, of the fundamental 
sociological principle that it is only through habitual, self- 
directed, productive labor that a whole people can be advanced 
in intelligence, morality, and the rational enjoyment of life. 
That prevention was a fearful injury which the institution of 
slavery did to the South; and the gradual establishment in the 
popular mind all over the South of the conviction that daily, 
steady, productive labor is the tap-root of civilization; is the 
greatest moral and intellectual gain which the South has been 
making during the last forty years. 
Individualism in education prophesies the desirable indi- 
vidualization in the social and industrial judgment of any 
race, white or colored, European, Asiatic, or African. Any 
race may naturally wish to have its value to mankind esti- 
mated, not by its lower half, or even its average, but by its 
upper tenth, individually valued. This individual estimation 
is all the more important when two different races live beside 
each other in industrial competition. In the community as a 
whole each person and each family should be treated as each 
deserves to be, not as an undistinguishable atom, or group of 
atoms, in a racial mass. 
For a period quite beyond the range of human foresight the 
welfare of the white race in the South is bound indissolubly 
with the welfare of the negro race. It is the common interest 
of the people of the South to cultivate the negro’s many valu- 
able qualities; to build him up economically by giving him 
access to land and trades, and the higher callings, so that he 
may make the social, physical, aud moral improvement which 
accompanies economic improvement; to educate his children
-P-A-G-E-155

to a better command and use of their senses in preparation for 
their life work, and with persistent regard to the provision of 
appropriate training and opportunity for the individual child. 
Finally, the American people as a whole must give the negro 
time to rise—not one generation or two generations from bar- 
barism or slavery, but some approach to as many generations 
as the white races have used for their rise out of a roving life 
of spasmodic labor and barbarous beliefs and customs. Above 
all, the whole people must have steady faith in the moralizing 
effects of well organized industries, successful agriculture, 
churches, schools, and that continuous education which sound 
family life, the public press, and the winning of a good liveli- 
hood are capable of giving. 
To improve and extend agricultural and industrial educa- 
tion all over the country is now the most fruitful task of 
American statesmen. To help in this way the least advanced 
races, or portions of races, within our borders, to develop intel- 
ligence, capacity, skill, and codoperative goodwill is the plain- 
est duty of the most advanced race. The best tests of the 
attainments and character of any nation are the level at which 
it starts its children in life, and the level to which it succeeds 
in raising them. The real values in human progress are best 
illustrated in the opportunities for healthy development and 
durable satisfactions provided for children and young people. 
They prophesy the happier future.

THE PRACTICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT. 
SUPT. JOSEPH E, AVENT, GOLDSBORO, N. C. 
Tue idea that every child should have a fair and equal op- 
portunity to become by education the best and most useful per- 
son that his capabilities permit has been of slow growth. That 
all the people of a State or community should be held respon- 
sible by taxation for that education has advanced even less 
rapidly. That the educational schemes of the various com- 
munities could be rendered the most possibly efficient by com- 
petent supervision has been the last idea to be taken hold of by 
the popular mind.
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
Starting back in 1837, at Buffalo, N. Y., and stopping in 
1839 at Providence, R. I., in 1840 at Springfield, Mass., and in 
1847 at Columbus, O., we see the first four City Superintend- 
ents in America. At first, the idea of putting a man at the 
head of a system of public schools was for the purpose of ad- 
ministration, rather than those of supervision. And, as late as 
1885, we find the New England Journal of Education declaring 
that “The most important question of the hour in matters of 
education is that of supervision.” But today, the business 
systems of the country being taken as models, it is generally 
recognized that there is great economy of the educational re- 
sources in having this educational labor divided and then 
directed by a competent and responsible head. And, if there 
is a town of more than 1,000 inhabitants that has not its 
graded schools and a Superintendent thereof, its citizenship 
is looked upon with suspicion, and it is regarded as a good 
place for progressive people to move from, rather than move to. 
While the necessity of a Superintendent of Schools in any 
town or city having a somewhat independent or locally con- 
trolled system is now accepted, it must be remembered, as I 
have already stated, that this has not always been so. Al- 
though city superintendence began three-quarters of a century 
ago, yet men who would acknowledge the benefits to be de- 
rived from enlightened supervision in mechanical employ- 
ments, in commercial life, and in government were not willing 
to admit for the schools the value and necessity of the same 
kind of supervision. Even men on school boards, themselves 
usefully employed as managers of stores, print-shops, saw 
mills, railroads, etc., thought a School Superintendent or 
Supervisor an unnecessary burden. Indeed, the acceptance of 
the Superintendent as a regular part of our educational 
scheme is only a recent thing. And the fact that the duties 
of the Superintendent differ so widely in the different com- 
munities is evidence of the process of evolution. In some 
places his duties are more those of administration; in others, 
supervision; in still others, all of both with many other 
invisible and unspecified duties attached. In many places he 
is both Superintendent and principal combined, and also does 
a large amount of class work.

POSITION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT. 
In the Southern States there are about 115 city school sys- 
tems whose enrollment is greater than 1,500 each. There are 
some four or five times as many with less. Therefore, in con- 
sideration of the fact that at least three-fourths of the Southern 
school systems have less than fifteen hundred pupils enrolled 
in each, and are town systems rather than city systems, it has 
seemed to me proper to consider in this discussion the position 
of the Superintendent in the smaller school systems. In fact, 
to try to discuss the Superintendent’s position in the larger 
city systems would be entirely presumptious on my part. Ex- 
perience has not qualified me for giving advice to those en- 
gaged in the larger work. But in the smaller school systems, 
what relationships must a Superintendent bear? What duties 
must he perform? What attitudes must he assume? In other 
words, what must this fellow you call Superintendent do? 
In the outset, it must be assumed that the Superintendent 
cannot give his time exclusively to supervision, though some 
of the best supervision will often be found in the smaller 
_ schools. I have in mind a Superintendent, with five hundred 
children and twelve teachers, who visited every room fre- 
quently. His teachers were, for the most part, untrained for 
their work, some of them being entirely new at the work. So 
he arranged for himself a programme by which he taught all 
the most important classes once every two weeks. Thus he was 
able to give his teachers the benefits of his training and experi- 
ence. He did not trust them entirely to carry out his plans 
from direction. He took hold and showed them how to do so. 
He was tactful in this and neither brought his teachers into 
disrepute or disrespect before their pupils, nor did he appear 
trying to display himself. He had each teacher make for him 
a map of her room locating the position of each pupil. When 
in the room he studied the face of each pupil and the map of 
the room, till he knew the names of the pupils. He kept him- 
self constantly informed, not only as to what the teachers were 
doing, but also as to what the pupils were doing. 
MEETING LOCAL CONDITIONS, 
Now, as a usual thing, a man strong in one point is weak in 
others. He may be expert in supervision and yet fail to main- 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
158 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tain a school acceptable to the community in which he serves. 
He may disregard strong local customs. He may forget that, 
while all things may be lawful for him, all things are not ex- 
pedient. He may regard himself as above criticism, and may 
be thrown clear off his base by adverse criticism, which comes 
not from the community as a whole, but from only one or two 
disgruntled individuals. A Superintendent once told me that 
there was a time in his experience when he would not serve a 
community, if there was to his knowledge a single individual 
opposed to him. In a town of some 4,000 inhabitants, a Super- 
intendent who had shown himself strong in a supervisory way, 
paid no heed to a local custom which required everybody to 
speak to everybody else, whether known or unknown. Hence, 
he came to be regarded as “stuck up,” and his stay in the com- 
munity was of short duration. 
Another man was unable to show to his teachers that he was 
absolutely impartial in his dealings with them, and they be- 
came divided into factions, ultimately leading to a division of 
the Board and to a division of the community. 
The duties and powers of the Superintendent will always 
vary in some important respects with the community. And the 
best Superintendent for each community is going to be he who 
best interprets local conditions, is best able to adapt himself 
to the circumstances growing out of these conditions, and 
brings the best possible results out of these conditions to the 
educational interests of the community. 
RELATIONS WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
Dr. Pickard, in his School Supervision, says: “City super- 
intendency of schools may be considered as a prism with 
polygonal bases. One face is turned toward the material ap- 
pliances used in school work; one toward school authorities; 
another toward the people at large; another toward the pa- 
trons of the schools; still another toward the teachers; the last 
and most important of all, toward the pupils.” Thus we see 
that the Superintendent’s relations are many. Happy is he 
who may be wise enough to maintain them all with discretion. 
His relations with his Board should be entirely harmonious. 
The Board is responsible directly to the people for the ef- 
ficiency of the schools. The Superintendent is responsible
-P-A-G-E-159
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 159 
directly to the Board and indirectly to the people themselves. 
The Board is the go-between for him and the people. In cases 
in which the Superintendent is occupied exclusively or chiefly 
with supervision, and is held responsible for the good work of 
the schools, he should be allowed all necessary powers and 
prerogatives. In matters entirely within the realm of his pro- 
fessional duties he should be free to use his judgment unmo- 
lested. A good man will accomplish infinitely much more by 
being trusted. And, if he cannot be trusted, he is not compe- 
tent for the position. However, there are many places, espe- 
cially in those communities in which only recently has a spe- 
cial tax been voted for the enlargement of their educational 
facilities, where he has not the freedom and the power that are 
accorded him in the older communities, and which are justly 
due him, if he would maintain his self-respect. 
PROMOTING NEW THINGS. 
Now, the Superintendent lives largely in the future. If he 
has any regard whatsoever for the work that he is doing, he is 
constantly planning for its upbuilding and betterment. Then 
he must work to develop with his Board a sentiment which will 
accord him the powers and influence which a Superintendent 
should justly have. He must establish the most friendly rela- 
tion possible with the individual members of the Board, and 
keep it up until they believe in him. Where a Superintendent 
has not been given a reasonably fair chance to run his schools 
according to his own judgment, it is necessary to prepare the 
members of the Board privately for any important new thing 
desired for the schools. If a Superintendent come in frequent 
casual contact with the members of his Board, without seem- 
ing to push himself upon them, it is an easy matter to acquaint 
them with what the other communities are doing and what the 
home school needs. It is seldom well to spring an entirely new 
subject upon a Board in session, or until the Superintendent 
has it clearly worked out in his own mind. If he fail to con- 
vince the members of the Board privately of the wisdom of his 
plans, it is generally bad practice to try to do so in open ses- 
sion. And if you fail to get what you ask for in open session, 
you lose prestige for future and probably more important con- 
tests. The Superintendent should avoid, if possible, fighting
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
a losing battle in open Board, unless it is a case in which the 
Board does not correctly represent the sentiment of the com- 
munity. 
ELECTION OF TEACHERS. 
The Superintendent should be Secretary of the Board. No 
one knows as well as he the conditions of the schools, or can 
give the Board more accurate information about them. He 
should have the power of nominating his teachers. If he can- 
not be trusted to do this, he should be dismissed and a man 
secured in whom the Board has such confidence. No teacher 
should be elected to a position in the schools whom the Super- 
intendent does not, and cannot recommend. To be sure, then, 
he should recommend no one whom the Board would be loath 
to elect and no Board has a right to hold a Superintendent 
responsible for the success of a school if it does not give him 
the power to name his helpers and to place them where they 
can do the best work. 
Assuming that a man has a position as Superintendent, em- 
ployed by the average Board of five to nine members who have 
entire confidence in him, have turned the entire management 
of the schools over to him, and have said: “We leave the 
schools to you and hold you responsible for the outcome,” let 
us consider in some respects this Superintendent’s practice. 
ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PUBLIC. 
First, what is he going to be toward that great body of stock- 
holders and shareholders in the community public school 
known as the general public. There is usually paid the Super- 
inendent of Schools in salary, however inadequate, more of the 
public funds than is paid the Mayor or any other officer of the 
city government. Then, as the people have paid their taxes for 
the establishment and maintenance of the public schools, what 
rights have they? Have they any rights that he is bound to 
respect? What have they to do with the schools? May the 
Superintendent simply ignore the public? 
Suppose I go to a merchant to buy a hat. He shows me sev- 
eral. I make a choice. Suppose he then assumes a dictatorial 
air and tells me that I have made a mistake, and that it will 
never do for me to wear that kind of a hat; that it is not
-P-A-G-E-161
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 161 
stylish. If I am satisfied with the hat you would expect me to 
say that, if he wants to sell me a hat, he will sell the one I 
want. On the other hand, if the merchant in a courteous way 
convinces me that his selection is more becoming to me than 
mine, I buy it, and both are satisfied. Suppose then, instead 
of using an I-know-it-all attitude toward the public, the Super- 
intendent shall, in a courteous way, convince the community 
that the adoption of some of his recommendations will enable 
the papers to say that they have “the best schools in the State ;” 
then he will have, at the same time, both ruled his own spirit 
and taken a city. Some school people do, as a matter of fact, 
seem to think that the parents and the general public have no 
rights in the education of their children by the community, or 
that they know anything about it. But, if a Superintendent 
come into frequent close personal contact with the people, open- 
minded and open-hearted, knows them and is known of them, 
he will seldom retain the idea, if he shall have ever had it, that 
he is the sole repository of educational wisdom in that com- 
munity. Most people are reasonable beings, but they are soci- 
able before they are reasonable. 
PUBLIC OPINION AND CONFIDENCE, 
Mr. Payne, in his School Supervision, says: “The ideal ele- 
ment, the consideration of what ought to be, should enter into 
the structure of every system; but, no less imperative is the 
need of keeping the mind intent on the actual State of the peo- 
ple whose interests are to be promoted. For the schools belong 
to the people; and the opinions, interests, and to some extent, 
even the whims of the people must be respected. It is not 
meant by this that the schools are to react to every suggestion, 
wise or foolish, friendly or sinister, which may come from with- 
out, for it is to shield them from.such calamities that Boards 
of Trustees interfere between these organizations and the ca- 
prices of individual opinion ; but it is meant that no institution 
which draws its support from the people at large can safely 
disregard the candid suggestions of public opinion.” 
Mr. Gilbert, in his “School and Its Life,” says: “Now, if he 
(the Superintendent) is a mere schoolmaster, limiting his field 
of activities to his office and to his schoolroom, comparatively 
unknown in the community, even if he has formulated many ad- 
11
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
mirable reports, proving incontrovertibly that his innovations 
are wise, the public is likely to reject them; but if the people 
know him, know his spirit and know him to be a wise and sen- 
sible man, when he says that some measure is good, they believe 
in him. A few minutes’ personal talk with a few of the ‘best 
people,’ the most influential citizens, by the Superintendent 
who has their confidence, will do more to pave the way for pos- 
sible reforms than all the articles that he may write or publish. 
Because often the public will stand by a person, rather than a 
theory, and the Superintendent owes it to his schools, 
and owes it to the School. Board, to put himself in such 
a position in the community that the citizens will be 
ready to stand by him, even when they do not fully 
understand what he is driving at.” Having established with 
the people a pleasant relation, the Superintendent ought to be 
of influence for the upbuilding of the community’s educational 
interests. He should not be afraid of the people of influence, 
nor should he stand aloof in his attitude toward those of hum- 
bler station. 
HELPING THE TEACHERS, 
What must the Superintendent be to that class of public 
servants with whom he must work day by day and whose work 
he must supervise? How is his work going to be related to 
theirs so that the work of both shall count for the most? In 
his teachers’ meetings, held monthly or bi-weekly, as circum 
stances may demand, he will instruct them in his course of 
study, in the maintenance of good discipline and in such other 
matters as shall pertain to the local schools. He may even or- 
ganize his teachers into a pedagogy class, and, by following a 
systematic course in this subject, may greatly enhance the 
teachers’ professional knowledge. In the teachers’ meeting the 
Superintendent’s work is directory, and cannot be made quite 
so effective as in the classroom and in the private conference. 
And in the former he is a supervisor, as in the latter he is an 
adviser. And he must not be content simply with directing 
how things are to be done; he must be able to take hold and 
show how they may be done. He must be a practitioner as well 
as a theorist. A teacher said to me last summer, “Our Super- 
intendent is constantly telling us to do a certain thing; yet it
-P-A-G-E-163
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 163 
has never seemed to occur to him to take hold and show us how 
to do it.” 
As the Superintendent goes from room to room, he sees some 
teachers doing so well that they may be left almost entirely to 
themselves. But he comes to others who are just moving along 
in a listless way, who are failing to inspire their children, who 
simply have no life in their teaching. One thing for the Super- 
intendent to do under such circumstances is to take hold and 
teach some for that teacher. If he have superior knowledge 
of teaching, let him give of it in meekness and wisdom to a 
needy one. Should there be aught in that teacher or her 
method that needs criticism, let the criticism be given in the 
private conference. Before the class the Superintendent’s mo- 
tive of helpfulness to both teacher and pupil should be entirely 
manifest. His attitude toward both should be such that both 
will be glad to see him come again. 
CRITICISM OF TEACHING. 
In the private conference, such criticism as shall be needed 
may be made and in a friendly manner. It should be positive 
and suggestive, rather than negative and condemnatory. A 
woman (and most teachers are women) will improve more 
rapidly on encouragement than on discouragement. If a 
teacher has failed in some one thing for the first time, 
effort should be made to fortify her against a second 
failure of the same kind. If she has done something 
well, commend her for it. Praise or censure should be 
entirely just and never given more abundantly than the case 
deserves. The timid Superintendent who fails to point out 
faults and then at the end of the year does not recommend for 
re-election the teacher in question, may be justly confronted 
with, “Why have you not told me before?” 
In the private conference, he may show how the teaching of 
certain subjects may be improved upon and how better dis- 
cipline may be secured. His wider experience and superior 
judgment may be added to her limited experience and inferior 
training. When a teacher leaves a conference with her Super- 
intendent, she should feel helped thereby. If she has been mak- 
ing a farce of teaching, her feeling should be such as will revo- 
lutionize her method.
-P-A-G-E-164
    164 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In the classroom visitation, in the private conference, in 
whatever relation, the Superintendent’s object is to help the 
teacher teach. Failing in this, he has lost his opportunity. He 
holds his position by virtue of the Board’s belief that he is 
really worthy to be at the head of the teaching force of the com- 
munity. And his inability to help his teachers teach is the 
surest evidence of his incompetence. 
It is well to confer with teachers about contemplated changes 
in the course of study. A competent and experienced teacher 
is prepared to give expert advice in this and her interest in 
the proper carrying out of the course of study is heightened 
thereby. She will enter with more enthusiasm into a plan in 
which she has had some part in the preparation. Whatever 
will promote the active and willing cooperation of the teachers 
with the Superintendent in his plans for the educational better- 
ment of the community is to be encouraged. 
RELATIONS WITH THE PUPILS. 
Passing now to the most important persons in the whole 
system, what has the Superintendent to do with the children? 
It is possible for the average Superintendent of enrollments of 
1,000 or less, if he continues in that community a year or more, 
to know by name all, or nearly all, of the children. Having 
a map of the room locating and naming every child, he may, 
when in the room, associate the faces of the children with the 
names on the map and easily learn them. A tremendous lever 
power is thus placed in his hands for their effective discipline. 
Then, too, the children appreciate being called by name, when 
you meet them on the street. And, I would not give the morn- 
ing salutation of thése vivacious young Americans for the 
recognition of the noblest dignitaries of the land. One day 
a boy said to his Superintendent, “We like the way you know 
us boys. One Superintendent we had here did not know a half 
dozen boys.” 
The Superintendent should remember his own experiences 
of childhood, and be all the time able to look at all questions 
from the children’s standpoint as well as from his own. 
Though a man, long since having put away childish things, 
he must still think as a child, seeing the little ones before him 
not “as in a glass darkly, but face to face.” In the smaller
-P-A-G-E-165
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 165 
schools where the Superintendent is also principal, the very 
gross violations of school discipline will have to be settled by 
him. In such cases, it should be his ambition to be entirely 
just, to look at the matter from every standpoint, and to con- 
vince all concerned of the justice of his decision. One day 
some boys were asked whether they were afraid of their Super- 
intendent. They replied: “No, we are not afraid of him, but 
‘we understand that when he tells us to do anything, he is not 
going to tell us a second time. He don’t bluff. We don’t mind 
doing what he tells us, because he always treats us right.” 
Children love strongly and they hate just as strongly. They 
are just as human as grown folks and some times more so. 
They are quick to recognize either justice or injustice. 
When visiting a room, the Superintendent should enter 
quietly, thus teaching them by example to work quietly. He 
may inspect casually their work at their seats, occasionally 
making some suggestions as will reinforce the work of the 
teacher. He may direct the change of a boy to another seat 
which fits him better. He may direct the removal of a mis- 
chievous boy to a location more conductive to that boy’s self- 
control. His attitude in the schoolroom should be kindly and 
gentle. While the Superintendent should at all times wear 
the dignity of his position, yet one may become so dignified 
as to become haughty, or even despicable in the eyes of the 
pupils. The Great Teacher is the one whose example is to be 
emulated, so simple in his manner, easily accessible, eminently 
gentle, yet altogether just, without hypocrisy, full of good 
works. So far as is humanely posible, that should be his 
bearing. 
SETTLING CONTROVERSIES. 
The Superintendent’s position frequently brings him to act 
the part of arbiter between teacher and parent. Nowhere else 
will he need a greater discretion. The teacher, every day in the 
presence of inferiors, is apt to be opinionated and dogmatic. 
The parent’s love for the child blinds him to the true facts in 
the case. Thus a controversy of no mean proportions is possible. 
Both sides heard in the presence of each other and of the child 
over whom the trouble has risen, the case usually settles itself 
to the satisfaction of both parties. A controversy of this kind, 
unless there is something back of it, cleared of misunderstand- 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ings, generally reduces itself to so small a thing as to be per- 
fectly puerile. If friendly relations are not immediately re- 
established, why, a delay of the Superintendent’s decision, until 
anger on either side shall have cooled, cannot do any harm, and 
each may be prepared for a decision that will, if need be, curb 
both the teacher’s opinionatedness and the parent’s blindness. 
Parents should be fully informed of the difficulties into which 
their children have fallen or are likely to fall. The parent’s 
interest in the school centers in the child. He sends his child 
to school to be educated. His own time is so devoted to busi- 
ness and his energies are so absorbed therein, that he trusts 
the teacher properly selected and efficiently supervised to do 
the work for him. He gives little time or thought to the mat- 
ter; he trusts it all to the teacher and the Superintendent. But 
the codperation of the parent, in the matter of both instruction 
and discipline, should in some way be elicited. When pupils, 
through neglect or inability, are in danger of falling out of 
their classes, their parents should be fully informed of the facts 
in the case, in the hope that they may stimulate their children 
to greater effort, and that they may be prepared for possible 
failures by their children. Neglect on the part of teachers to 
notify parents of such things, either by personal interview or 
on forms to be obtained from the Superintendent’s office, is just 
cause for complaint against the teacher. Parents should be 
informed, too, of bad conduct on the part of their children. 
Of course, every little thing that goes wrong should not be re- 
ported; but when children persist in misbehavior, for which 
the ordinary mode of punishment seems inadequate, or which 
promises to go from bad to worse, the parent should be given 
the full facts in the case. To the most effective codperation 
between teacher and parent let the Suprintendent give much 
attention. 
The Superintendent is always on the hub, as it were, of the 
school system. Everything revolves about him. At all times, 
the School Board, the teachers, the pupils, the patrons, and the 
press look to him. At one time he must be judge and advocate, 
legislator and executor, pedagogue and clerk. His is the work 
of shaping policies far in advance, of reconciling disgruntled 
citizens and teachers, of being all things to all men.

THE RELATION OF NORMAL SCHOOL MUSIC TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WORK. 
From the normal schools there comes a cry, pitiful and plead- 
ing, for students who have had more nearly adequate training, 
or at least some little, training in the subject of music. And 
from the public schools there comes a cry, more nearly sound- 
ing like a petulant demand, asking that teachers that come 
from our professional schools be prepared to give proper music

training to their pupils, either under the guidance of a super- 
visor or without that welcome assistance. 
It shall be the purpose of this paper to show, first: that the 
present efficiency of normal school music work is below what it 
should be. Second: that if the condition of normal school 
music be improved, the status of music in all the ramifications 
of the public school system will be raised. Third: that, with 
more general attention paid to music in the public schools, 
there will be a proportionate reaction upon music in the nor- 
mal schools. And lastly: what shall we do about it? 
Judging from the statistics as obtained by Mr. Manchester, 
of Converse College, 8. C., nine per cent of the normal schools 
report that various percentages of their students give ten hours 
or more per week to music. One of these schools is the Crane 
Normal Institute of Music, Pottsdam, N. Y., another is the 
Catholic Normal School, Wisconsin, in both of which cases 
music is evidently made a major subject. 
Twenty-two per cent of the normal schools report that some 
of their students give five or more periods a week to music. 
These few normals, and the various schools to which their 
graduates go, are very much to be congratulated upon the gen- 
erous treatment accorded their music departments. 
At the head of the list of fortunate ones should probably be 
placed the public schools of Cincinnati. Three generations ago, 
in 1835, the revered Charles Aiken and his assistant, William 
Colburn, began their work of teaching the children to sing. 
And steadily, during these generations, has music been ac- 
corded its rightful place in the heads and hearts of those chil- 
dren. Through the eight grammar grades, four years of the 
high school, as well as in the Teachers’ College, and University, 
has music gone hand in hand with the “three R.’s.” And what 
is the result? The observer finds there a music-loving people, 
conservatories of music that rival those of Boston and Greater 
New York. Notable among the musical attractions is the 
famous Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, second to none in the 
United States. There is, besides, the well attended May Fes- 
tival, whose support from the music lovers of the city is of so + 
substantial a nature as to make it possible for the Festival 
management to engage as its soloists a galaxy of the greatest 
stars of the musical world. In fact, Cincinnati has become,
-P-A-G-E-169
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 169 
chiefly through its public school music, one of the few recog- 
nized musical centers of the United States. And what of the 
pedagogical situation? All applicants for positions as teachers 
in the Cincinnati schools must be graduates of the Cincinnati 
University and Teachers’ College. Then, if they can pass city 
examinations, they must teach for a year as substitutes before 
their names are placed. on the list of the Superintendent of 
Schools. “This is probably the highest standard of any city 
in the United States and possibly the world.” 
But what of the sixty-nine per cent of normal schools left out 
in the cold—with “Jess than five hours per week?”—for in too 
large a proportion of these cases the phrase “less than five 
hours per week” is only a charitable way of saying one lesson 
per week, or thirty-six lessons for the scholastic year. Music 
is one of the most subtle of the fine arts: and yet is it to be 
considered so simple that a pedagogical knowledge of it can be 
acquired in thirty-six hours during each of the three years, 
when arithmetic has required sixteen hundred hours? To 
quote Miss Crane of Crane Normal Institute: “After a stu- 
dent has had his sixteen hundred hours in arithmetic, the nor- 
mal school provides as many hours for the study of methods in 
arithmetic as are allotted the full course in music. Is music 
teaching such a natural gift that successful teachers can be 
expected under these conditions? Is it surprising that the 
statement is often made that the normal schools do not fit their 
graduates to teach music of the grades?” 
What would the musical world call a fair preparation on the 
part of the grade teacher? First of all, there must be the 
ability to sing easy songs with correctness, and intelligence as 
to phrasing, etc. But immediately some one raises the objec- 
tion, what of those otherwise excellent teachers who are tone 
deaf? Let them prepare either to sing their songs by proxy or 
to do departmental work where their deplorable lack will never 
be discovered. For in the primary grades an abundant supply 
of good and attractive rote songs is needed as the initial lan- 
guage or expression work in music. And in all grades, up to 
that point where the students are able to read their own songs 
at pleasure, rote songs should be freely used for their ethical 
and aesthetic value. Martin Luther gave expression to a 
psychologic fact in this terse form, “Words, music hallowed,  
-P-A-G-E-170
170 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
never die.” These rote songs, then, may become the students’ 
future treasury; they are the teacher’s great responsibility. 
G, Stanley Hall, in his address on the function of college music, 
well said: “Good music may almost create virtue and tune the 
heart to all that is good, beautiful, and true, bring poise, cour- 
age, enthusiasm, joy of life, tone up weakness, and cadence the 
soul to religion and morals. 
Obviously, then, those teachers who cannot sing for their 
students the songs which may be considered necessary from a 
cultural as well as musical standpoint, have placed themselves 
in the wrong department of school work. 
Second, there should be the ability to read at sight a melody 
or a harmony part equal in difficulty to J. B. Dykes’ “Lead, 
Kindly, Light,” for example; for no amount of enthusiasm over 
the ethical value of music can supply the lack of ability in 
sight reading. As a builder in musical education, every teacher 
should have a working knowledge of its tools. 
Third, in technical knowledge, there should be a perfect mas- 
tery of such items as scale construction, key signs, meter sings, 
tonalities under various disguises, transpositions, etc. 
Fourth, such a knowledge of composition as would enable 
the teacher to write practical studies or songs in one or two 
parts. 
Fifth, there should be a reasonable familiarity with the great 
names of the musical world, and sufficient information on mat- 
ters of musical history to obviate the danger of such state- 
ments as “Anon was an Italian composer living in the seven- 
teenth century.” 
Sixth, and last and by no means least, these grade teachers 
must have gained the knowledge by which they can discrimi- 
nate between good and bad music, and must have acquired not 
only an abhorrence of yellow-backed musical literature, but an 
equally strong appreciation of that which is good. 
Does anyone raise the objection that these requirements are 
rather too comprehensive? The reply comes, they do not go one 
whit beyond what have been for years, for generations, the 
requirements in every other subject, except that of the kindred 
art, drawing. 
There is an old principle in economics that the supply tends 
to equal the demand. Are our normal graduates supplied with 
all the abilities as here demanded? Decidedly, they are not.
-P-A-G-E-171
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 171° 
Now where lies the blame for this deficiency? With the nor- 
mal school instructors? Well, if so, courtesy and generosity 
have kept the critics quiet on this point. But could an unques- 
tionably talented instructor, with pupils of mediocre ability, 
accomplish the desired end, no one lesson or even two lessons 
per week, for a course of three school years? The logical 
theorist and the experienced teacher must unite in an emphatic 
no. The time allotted is far too short and far out of propor- 
tion to the demands in music and to the distribution of time 
given to other subjects. 
Now let us imagine that by some means, magic or otherwise, 
the standing of music in all our normal schools has been ad- 
vanced, the instructors not handicapped by poor tools nor lack 
of time, the subject itself not tolerated as a useless art and 
a concession to the effeminate taste, but ranking according to 
its merits, both as an art and as a science, which latter condi- 
tion has for some years been the case in the larger institutions 
of learning in America. Just here, let us digress for a paren- 
thetical quotation from Mr. Manchester on this subject. “The 
treatment of music education,” he says, “in colleges, particu- 
larly those of women, and in secondary schools, has been one 
of confusion, and, too often, of low standards. The larger insti- 
tutions are notable exceptions. As early as 1837, a society 
known as the Harvard Musical Association, composed of 
alumni of Harvard College, announced as its ultimate object: 
‘The advancement of the cause of music, particularly in this 
university.’ We would have it regarded as an important object 
of attention within its walls, as something which sooner or 
later must hold its place in every liberal system of education— 
and that place not an accidental or a stolen one, but formally 
recognized. We that love music feel that it is worthy of its 
professorship, as well as any other science.” And the musical 
and professional circles remember Harvard for having blazed 
the way for the rest of us, she having been first to grant credits 
in music toward the degree of A. B. (1870) ; first to establish 
full professorship, 1876; first to grant entrance credits for 
musical qualifications. To Harvard be due honor paid for the 
uplift she has given to the standing of music in our educational 
institutions. 
Returning, let us see just what would be the effect upon the
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
public schools if music were more comprehensively and thor- 
oughly taught in normal schools than is now generally possible 
under existing circumstances. Some of the normal school stu- 
dents enter with a modicum of knowledge of music, it is true. 
But in too large a per cent of normal schools in our newer 
States, an appalling number of students present themselves in 
music classes, and have to confess that they know nothing 
technically of vocal music and have, in fact, never even heard 
the scale sung as what we might call a vocal formula. They 
know nothing of the masterpieces of musical literature, their 
hearts have seldom been touched by such a plaint as Mignon’s 
“Dost Thou Know That Fair Land?” nor gladdened by Men- 
delssohn’s “Spring Song;” their souls have never been lifted 
toward heaven on the wings of such songs as 
“When Morning gilds the skies 
My heart awakened cries, 
May Jesus Christ be praised.” 
And worse still, the songs with which they have been familiar 
are for the most part best classed as yellow-backed literature, 
unworthy the attention of any student, and perfectly unfit for 
the plastic minds of children. With ample opportunity and 
means, our normal schools would quickly lead their students 
away from all worthless music, to that which is clean, correct, 
strong, and inspiring, thus sending out to our country the city 
school graduates who are better prepared intellectually and 
spiritually to be the leaders of the children in their community. 
Are not our schoolrooms too often dominated by that cut- 
ting, strident speaking voice, from which adults will con- 
sciously flee as quickly as possible, but from which the chil- 
dren cannot get away? A voice of this sort is ample cause for 
nervousness with adult hearers, but with the helpless children, 
it shows itself as a case of restlesness and so-called “disorder.” 
The general voice-culture work in our normal schools can and 
should modify, if not wholly eradicate, the harshness and other 
unpleasant qualities of our future teachers. And along this 
line of discipline, what experienced pedagogue does not know 
the corrective, refreshing, enticing effect of a charming song, 
introduced at a timely moment? Suppose thirty or forty boys 
and girls to have come in from their play at recess, where the 
games may have been a bit boisterous, or the vanquished may
-P-A-G-E-173

not yet be able to give a friendly smile to the victor: what bet- 
ter thing coulda teacher do than to start the pupils brightly 
on such a song as Mrs. Gaynor’s “Foggies’ Swimming School,” 
whose two stanzas consume, by the way, exactly one minute of 
valuable time—and most scoldings, or that silence in which 
children are often allowed to readjust themselves, generally 
take more time, and accomplish less. And it is in the normal 
schools that our teachers should procure not only a working 
knowledge of what are good schoolroom songs, but also a work- 
ing repertoire. 
In most country schools, and in far too many village schools, 
the “powers that be” feel too poor or imagine the school patrons 
unwilling to buy music texts of any sort, so that the teacher 
in charge must be the text, must furnish the genius for the 
occasion. Here, then, is ample room for the practical applica- 
tion of the normal school work in composition, phrasing, har- 
mony, ete. 
The students think that musical play, running up and down 
a tone ladder represented in wood or drawn upon the black- 
board, is great fun. Or, perhaps better still, It is most inter- 
esting to read songs from the five-lined staff—fingers on “teach- 
er’s” left hand—the “notes” being placed there, one by one, by 
the pointing finger of “teacher’s” right hand. Or, by way of 
variety, easy songs written on the board in scale numbers or 
scale syllables, from splendid incentives to further study. 
It might not be amiss right here to add that just such work 
as this, well done, with the further attraction of beautiful rote 
songs, will so popularize music with the children, and through 
them the parents, that the music books, at first noticeable by 
their absence, will soon be forthcoming. And this desideratum 
will be gained, too, with the full consent of the School Board, 
who, as school men or as politicians, are neither blind nor deaf 
to the wishes and just demands of the public. 
Now as to our third proposition, namely, that with more gen- 
eral attention paid to music in the public schools, there will be 
a proportionate reaction upon the music of the normal schools 
—to try to prove this would be almost as useless as to try to 
prove the truth of an axiom. Musical seed can produce only 
musical fruitage. 
Yet to most instructors of music in normal schools, to think  
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of having classes composed wholly of students from country 
and city schools where music had been adequately taught would 
be quite a bit like heaven, very delightful, indeed, but hard to 
imagine. Think of the splendid choruses that might be given, 
the benefit that might be derived, from the intellectual associa- 
tion with such minds as Handel, Mendelssohn, Rubinstein, 
Wagner, and others, if only the necessary foundation had been 
laid, making such study possible! Doubtless a little work of 
this kind all normal schools attempt, but by what painfully 
slow degrees are results accomplished, only the initiated know; 
whereas music students should be able to study their Handel or 
Wagner scores, just as English classes study their Milton or 
Shakespeare texts. 
But the stern facts that we must face right now are that in 
the great majority of normal schools, music is not given an 
amount of time commensurate with the results demanded by 
the public schools. Normal school graduates in general are not 
prepared fo do the music work of the grade room, and, in turn, 
the pupils entering the normal schools are equally unprepared 
to take work in music at all parallel with their work in Eng- 
lish, geography, and the like. Many School Boards, too, are 
either ingnorant of the cultural and ethical value of music, to 
say nothing of the keen mental drill possible, or else are indif- 
ferent, and are merely waiting for the public to make known 
its wishes in the matter. 
Now what shall we do about it? It is an acceded fact that 
the majority of educators would gladly see music study made 
more general as well as more practical and thorough. But to 
whom shall we turn in our efforts to bring about this desired 
condition of affairs? First of all, to our students of both pub- 
lic schools and normals. This is upon the plain business of 
advertising “directly among the consumers.” Children of all 
ages naturally love music, and through this God-given faculty 
of music-loving and music-making, we can create a desire which 
shall grow by what it feeds upon. But in popularizing music, 
I would not be thought for a moment as suggesting its accom- 
plishment by means of so-called popular music. On the con- 
trary, the greatest ultimate success will be gained through the 
use of the purest music obtainable. No mistake can be more 
fatal to the lasting success of this enterprise than the use of 
music of a low or even ordinary standard. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 175 
The people of the poor do not need poor music: the people of 
the slums do not need and are not helped by “slummy” music. 
In this connection, might it not be well for our amateur 
teachers to remember that not all hard music is good, and not 
all good music is hard. And, also, as Edward Baxter Perry 
has said, that “classic music is not so bad as it sounds.” 
It is the concensus of opinion among philanthropists who 
work among the very poor and lowly that the Sistine Madonna 
and the Oratorio of the Messiah speak as directly and unmis- 
takbly to the factory hand as to the factory owner. In the lan- 
guage of the Oriental saying, let us “make haste slowly,” re- 
membering that the best is none too good for our students, 
Nor can this musical awakening be accomplished through the 
cold theory of music: it must come through the pulsating life 
of song. Says Dr. Clarke, “all the mathematical and acoustical 
lore in the world would not endow their possessor with the 
ability to write one phrase of the “Last Rose of Summer ;” even 
as a “speaking acquaintance” with all the langauges of men 
since the dispersion at Babel would not enable one to write 
“Hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings 
And Pheebus ’gins arise.” 
In union there is strength and in concerted action there is 
power. Our desire to see music-culture as widespread as is 
public education should take upon itself the form of a well 
directed campaign, conducted as are other movements having 
the good of the people at heart. Our leaders should lend us 
their time, their influence, and give us of their wisdom. Our 
magazines and papers should arouse the public to the fact that 
there are advantages within reach which have not yet been 
fully appreciated nor appropriated. The rank and file should 
keep the good of the cause close at the warm hearts of the 
people. 
But “if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, 
chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes’ 
palaces. * * * J can easier teach twenty what were good 
to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teach- 
ing.”

THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL: A FACTOR IN SOCIAL 
EFFICIENCY. 
MRS. E, M. BAKER, SEDALIA, MO, 
Our school system conforms to no standard set by centralized 
authority. It has been developed according to the peculiarities 
of particular communities—each State soveregin and independ- 
ent in its own jurisdiction. This is typically American and 
refiects the national life. However, this system deals with 
intelligent human beings. Therefore, no matter how wise the 
plan or how successful the issue, it cannot remain stationary. 
Development, the natural concomitant of evolution, calls for 
reconstruction all along the line. 
The times demand an efficient system that shall make ade- 
quate provision for vocational training for both boys and girls. 
The secondary schools can easily adapt themselves to indus- 
trial education; many have already done so. But the great 
bulk of our children leave school at the end of the grammar 
school period, or when they attain the limit of the compulsory 
school age—fourteen in most States. Since the masses receive 
practically all their education in the elementary schools, it is 
quite plain that industrial education must become a part of 
them, and so related as to increase the intelligence and morale 
of the indivdual. The recruits for our industries must be intel- 
ligent, well disciplined, well trained, cultured, full of integrity, 
and overflowing with good health. 
The chief factor in this order of social efficiency is the gram- 
mar school. It must hold each boy and girl, not through com- 
pulsion, but through interest. It must tenderly nourish and 
direct their feelings that abiding enthusiasm may be awakened. 
Within its domain each child shall live the truest, the best, the 
most useful life; each must be highly endowed—superior even 
to the full measure of his capacity. At this critical stage, 
friends, it is very important that these children shall live sin 
cerely; shall do well the thing they want to do; shall want to 
do that which is right. That they shall not lie or steal is not 
enough. They must be able to discern wherein lying and steal- 
ing consist.
-P-A-G-E-177
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. Le 
The great majority of our youth enter the world with little 
comprehension of the serious purposes of life. They do not 
realize that they have reached the critical stage when habits 
become fixed, when plasticity gives way to permanency. “Seek- 
ing occupation, they engage in juvenile work with juvenile pay. 
Instead of developing into progressive, ambitious, patriotic, 
loyal men and women, they swell the ranks of the discontented 
and become a menace to growth, social efficiency and progress.” 
Their work is routine work of the most deadening kind. In 
the factory if a lad learns one machine he is wanted for that 
and no other. To learn a new one means loss in raw material, 
in steam power, or in the injury of the machine itself. Promo- 
tion is rare. He has no chance to learn the principles of his 
trade. He is but a part of the machine itself, an automaton. 
Train him in our schools for his life work and we shall not need 
to import skilled labor. Again, incompetency in domestic oc- 
cupations is the source of domestic misery which in turn leads 
to intemperance and worse. Train the future wives and 
mothers for their calling and ills now treatening our nation 
will surely disappear. 
The demand for industrial schools is a sane one and has been 
answered in many places. But to obtain wholesome results we 
must have a universal system. Isolated schools run great risk 
of the domination of the employer, and call for specialization 
too early. We need in the grades both the workman and the 
teacher—the one to teach how to build and run machines; how 
to till the soil, to manage commercial and household affairs; 
the other to jead the toiler to know that human spirit can im- 
pregnate the work of the hand and make labor art, the beau- 
tiful way of doing things. Head, heart and hand must develop 
harmoniously. The hand more effectively than the head brings 
the heart to realize the sweetness, the sacredness of a life de- 
voted to high duty and ennobling service. 
Since the times demand intelligent, skilful labor, the elemen- 
tary schools must lay enduring foundations for a worthy sup- 
ply. These schools deal with the plastic age, the most impor- 
tant time for motor training; the age when the child develops 
in leaps and bounds, and is capable of doing much more than 
we think. The limits of the grades retard him and he chafes at 
the restriction. His place should be determined, not by the 
12
-P-A-G-E-178

work in the past—whether pages or classes—but by the work 
he is able to do next. We too often “bandage the foot and strap 
the skull to produce a standard size.’ The work we now do 
in the grades can be, and has been, done well in seven years, 
possibly it may be done in six. At any rate the last two years 
need refreshing and re-adapting. There is too much repetition 
in them; they fail to keep abreast of the life-interests and the 
constantly advancing mental cravings of the pupil. After six 
years of work a boy is ready for something new, something that 
will touch the budding interest in life. To lose his interest is 
to lose the boy. The eighth grade should be more diversified, 
more advanced. In it there should be higher mathematics, 
algebra, some geometry, one or more of the foreign languages 
and plenty of biography and research. 
Furthermore, the last years of the grammar school should 
direct the boys and girls to a trade; should give them full op- 
portunity to explore their capacities. Then, with parents and 
teacher, after due consideration, each should select that which 
is most congenial; that from which he can get the greatest 
happiness and the most abiding joy, thereby creating condi- 
tions which will inevitably lead to excellence and secure 
success. 
The choice, however, is but a beginning. With the decision, 
work should commence in earnest with a closer application to 
study. Ifa position be secured, the study must be done at regu- 
lar intervals. This will call for continuation schools. Em- 
ployers should be compelled by law to send all boys and girls 
to these schools for two hours each day until a full high school 
course has been completed. 
America cannot do less. Her industrial training must be a 
liberal education—not merely enough to answer the immediate 
demands of the trade for which one is trained. It must give 
the laborer professional proficiency and teach him the mean- 
ing of his vocation while it strengthens the ties of sympathy. 
She cannot afford to have a different and a lower standard of 
life and training for the factory and unskilled labor. This is to 
create class distinction. The mission of her schools is to enrich 
the common school education by the interests of the trade; to 
interpret the trade activities through instruction in the school- 
room; to broaden the meaning of life of every citizen, not a

few, by correlating the intellectual, the spiritual, the cultural 
interests with those of industry. “Life without industry is 
guilt; industry without art is brutality.” 
Failure at this point will be irremediable failure; for the ad- 
vantages which America possesses in her democracy should 
show themselves most definitely in the education of her work- 
men. Then these, the fully developed—the socially efficient— 
out of the wealth of their lives, will leave a heritage that shall 
make future generations decline goods won at the too great 
cost of health, honor and happiness.

HENRY F. COPE, SECRETARY. 
Wuen the Religious Education Association was organized 
in 1903 two sets of conditions demanded immediate attention. 
On the one side even the best friends of the Sunday school 
were compelled to confess that it deserved some of the ava- 
lanche of criticism it received; on the other, there were grave 
questionings as to whether our agencies of public education 
were returning a fair social interest on the investment made 
in them, whether while they were increasing in efficiency in 
teaching subjects they were not neglecting the teaching of peo- 
ple, the training of pupils to right living, in good morals. 
We have been in danger of paying so much attention to the 
curriculum that we have lost sight of the importance of char- 
acter. The school that concerns itself only with its courses 
and not at all with the type of character it develops in stu- 
dents may be teaching subjects, but it is not teaching men and 
women; it may be instructing, but it is not educating in any 
worthy sense. Religious education means, not simply instruc- 
tion in the Bible, or in theology or any other formal religious 
subjects; it may include these wherever they are appropriate, 
but it means all education whether in home, in public school, 
in church, in college, through newspaper, library or whatever 
it may be impregnated with the religious spirit, guided by the 
religious aim and planned for the religious ideal of character.

    180 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Religious Education Association exists to inspire all our 
educational agencies with such a religious aim, with the ideal 
of character development. It seeks to grapple with the prob- 
lems of the training of character at home, taking up the ques- 
tions of the preparation of parents for home-making and for 
the education of their children, questions of family organiza- 
tion, family religion and the many difficult matters of the 
training of children in honesty, reverence and uprightness 
through the home. It takes up the problems of the Sunday 
school, the training of teachers, the selection of lesson material 
suited to a child’s life, making these once despised schools of 
the church real and worthy educational agencies. Why should 
not a Sunday school be as efficient, as dignified and as valu- 
able to the life of the child as any other school? It will be 
when we learn to take it seriously and are willing to pay the 
price for it. ’ 
Departments, including groups of specialists, in the Reli- 
gious Education Association are studying the problems of 
moral training in the colleges, the questions of the lives of men 
in the fraternity chapter houses, of the moral conditions of 
living in dormitories, of all that may be done in the college 
life, in the curriculum and through athletics for the training 
of character there. 
Other departments study the problems of moral and reli- 
gious training in the homes, the public schools, the Y. M. C. A., 
and the Y. W. C. A., the churches, the Sunday schools, through 
libraries and the press. The business of each department is 
to render helpful service to all who are engaged in its field, to 
parents, teachers, pastors, libraries, etc. Then the association 
also aids such workers by its Bureau of Information and its 
Exhibit and Library, maintained at its Chicago office. Here, 
either personally or by correspondence, any one, whether a 
member of the association or not, may have freely aid, advice, 
suggestions of improved methods, direction of literature, 
books, ete., which would help in any way. Fathers and 
mothers, teachers and preachers write asking a wonderful 
variety of questions. Many of them are referred to specialists 
for answer, but an honest effort is made to aid every one. 
The Religious Education Association exists to serve, not to 
supplant; to aid every existing agency, not to create new ones.

It inspires, aids, cojperates with the forces that are, not at- 
tempting to organize any new machinery. The association de- 
sires not so much to do things as to cause things to be done. 
Best of all, the Religious Education Association offers every 
man and woman anxious that our present-day life shall make 
for character, that we shall not lose our hold on God, and as 
a people, that our boys and girls may be strengthened for God- 
fearing and man-loving living by their studies and school life, 
that the church may be sufficient for the great task of this day, 
an opportunity to express themselves, to invest themselves, at 
the greatest advantage in endeavor to realize their ideals. 
Membership in the Religious Education Association is a big 
opportunity to have a share in the largest task before our day. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE TEACHER AND INTERNATIONALISM. 
FANNIE FERN ANDREWS, 
Secretary of American School Peace League, Boston. 
INTERNATIONALISM is a term of recent usage. Only within the 
last decade have people become conscious of the natural bond 
of international affiliation. The opening at The Hague of the 
first world peace congress on the eighteenth day of May, 1899, 
ushered in a new period in the development of nations—a 
period in which the progress of every country is recognized to 
be increasingly dependent on the national aspirations and 
national deeds of every other country. People all over the 
world are coming to see that precisely as the civilized indi- 
vidual no longer relies on the duel, or the scufile in the street 
brawl to procure for himself the rights and the privileges that 
justice demands, so nations must have recourse not to might, 
but to right; not to armies, but to arguments; not to navies, 
but to pleadings before disinterested international tribunals. 
This new spirit is well described by the term international- 
ism, and curious as it may seem, it was the Czar of Russia 
who, by calling the first peace congress, set in motion the 
political machinery which makes possible a rapid development 
of international codperation, international federation.
-P-A-G-E-182
  182 SOUTHERN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Three great forces have been active in focusing the atten- 
tion of the world on this twentieth century democracy. There 
is, first, that natural commingling of peoples in their various 
activities, such as industry, education, religion, science, litera- 
ture, art, philanthropy and government. 
The second great force has been the constructive work of the 
nations toward a federated world. When the Congress at 
Vienna was arranged in 1815, for the purpose of bringing 
order out of the political chaos left by the Napoleonic cam- 
paigns, there was inaugurated the custom of holding interna- 
tional congresses to consider in a rational way subjects of com- 
mon interest. Since that time, many international congresses 
have been held, and each one has resulted in greater and 
greater mutual acquaintance and common understanding. 
When, therefore, the Czar of Russia issued his famous rescript 
in August, 1898, inviting the nations to send delegates to a 
conference to consider what could be done to stop interna- 
tional war, and thus restrict the spending of such enormous 
sums of money for armies and navies, the nations had sufficient 
confidence in each other to send their greatest statesmen to dis- 
cuss a subject which up to this time had been considered a pri- 
vate matter for each individual nation. 
The most constructive work of the Conference was the sign- 
ing of three conventions by the Committee on Arbitration— 
those providing for special mediation by neutral powers, for 
International Commissions of Inquiry, and for the establish- 
ment of an International Arbitration Court. The first con- 
vention enabled President Roosevelt to arrange a conference 
between Russia and Japan for the purpose of stopping one of 
the bloodiest wars in history. The peace of Portsmouth is the 
historical event which marks this step in the development of 
the arbitration system. 
The second convention, providing for International Commis- 
sions of Inquiry, enabled the powers of Great Britain and 
Russia to settle speedily and peacefully a great dispute, inci- 
dent to the Russian-Japanese war. When the Russian fleet 
fired on the British fishing vessels, mistaking them for the 
Japanese fleet, it looked as if war would result at once; but 
under this rule of inquiry England referred this matter to a 
committee of investigation, and thus war was averted. The
-P-A-G-E-183
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 183 
“Dogger Bank Affair,” as this was called, will always stand 
out prominently in the history of arbitration. 
The most far-reaching of these conventions, however, was 
the provision for an International Court of Arbitration; for, 
since the court was opened in April, 1901, nearly every great 
nation of the earth has been before it. 
Such was the phenomenal growth of the spirit of interna- 
tionalism, that in 1907, when the second Peace Congress was 
held, practically every nation in the world sent delegates, thus 
making this in reality a World Peace Congress. Not only did 
the delegates endorse and reinforce all that was done at the 
first Peace Congress, but they found that they had the public 
opinion of the world behind them in singing a convention for 
the establishment of a permanent international court which 
should be to the nations of the world what our Supreme Court 
is to the States of the United States. Everything was agreed 
upon which should make the court a reality except the method 
of selecting judges. It is probable, however, according to the 
latest knowledge, that Secretary Knox’s proposal to the gov- 
ernments to organize this court will be acted upon favorably. 
Thus do we find almost within reach the judicial department 
of a world government. 
By its decision to hold a third conference about 1915, the 
second Peace Congress has really laid the foundation for a 
Parliament of the Nations, the legislative complement of the 
international court. It does not require much vision to see the 
trend of internationalism today. 
We must not forget the third great force which has for over 
a hundred years argued that the way to peace is through 
justice, and that international judicial awards can be enforced 
by international public opinion. The modern peace movement 
began as a moral revolt against the cruelty and wickedness of 
war. It soon emphasized, however, the economic and govern- 
mental arguments. With this appeal to the progressive 
thought of the times the five hundred peace societies in the 
world constitute the organizing and directing force in the 
great political and economic readjustment that is swiftly lead- 
ing the world on to international peace—to the establishment 
of a permanent International Court and a World Congress. 
What relation does the teacher bear to this international-  
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ism? Certainly he should understand what it all means. 
Everybody should be alive to a force which is shaping the des- 
tinies of the human race. There are vital reasons, however, 
why teachers especially should become acquainted with the 
facts and principles of this social, economic, and politcal force. 
In the first place, there are at the basis of the movement those 
ethical ideals which the teacher labors to establish and to 
foster within his own field of activity. The inculcation of 
such ideals lifts the growing youth to a higher plane of social 
and civic life. : 
Since this development of international politics, leading 
directly toward a federation of the nations, vitally concerns 
our own country which has taken on during the last ten years 
a new economic and political significance among the nations 
of the world, the teacher of geography and history should un- 
derstand the progress of the international movement. The 
pupil should learn through geography that the resources of all 
countries are needed to supply our wants—in fact, that every 
active man, wherever he may be, makes some contribution to 
the world at large. 
To give the’proper interpretation to the historical records 
of our country, whose federation of States foreshadows the 
federation of nations; whose National Congress, the congress 
of the world; whose Supreme Court, the permanent interna- 
tional court—the teacher of history must bring out the fact 
that our history is a part of world history, and that we have 
a racial inheritance to which people of various lands and ages 
have made invaluable contributions. Our national life, in all 
its phases, is closely interwoven with the life of European 
countries. Our teachers, too, must point out the special mis- 
sion of the United States, the grandest experiment in the de- 
velopment of democracy, in the movement for the completion 
of the great union of nations.

THE PRINCIPLES OF SCHOOL HYGIENE. 
WILLARD 8. SMALL, 
Principal Hastern High School, Washington, D. C. 
We sometimes fail to distinguish between rights as such and 
the historical recognition of rights. All of our most precious 
rights are acquired so far as full recognition and enjoyment of 
them are concerned. The right to life itself is historically an 
acquisition. Perhaps the intensity of the struggle for life 
itself and for liberty account for the long delay in the recog- 
nition by the human race of the right to health. Another fac- 
tor has been the lack of scientific knowledge. People have 
looked upon health rather as a gift than as an attainment. 
With the mass of people this is still largely true, and human 
health in consequence is miserably in arrears of its attainable 
possibilities. But with our present knowledge of sanitation 
and hygiene, and, in general, of the conditions of normal hu- 
man life the absurdity of this position is apparent. Health 
is a gift no more than any other human endowment is a gift; 
health is a right in the same degree that liberty and happiness 
are rights; health, like other rights, is secured not by special 
dispensation, but by a constructive public policy and by intel- 
ligent individual effort. 
The fact that health is a right and the fact that health is an 
acquisition for each individual, are fundamental. The old 
adage, Mens sana in sano corpore, has figured in the literature 
of education with blithe assurance, but it has never had a fair 
deal in actual practice. An implicit dualism has always em- 
phasized the mens and has subordinated the corpus. Neither 
has been truly served. Health must be conceived as a right, 
therefore as an end in the educative process, not as a means 
towards more knowledge. Until we understand that the word 
health comprehends three of the most essential values of life— 
efficiency, vitality, joyousness—our theories of education and 
our organization of educational procedure will be equally per- 
verse. When we get that conception we shall understand that 
the school must be a constructive factor in the promotion of 
health. The key to the situation is the education of teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
into an understanding of health as a right, of its acquired 
character, and of the role of the various factors of school life 
in promoting or hindering this acquisition. The specific prob- 
lem of the normal school is to formulate a course in school 
hygiene that shall accomplish this purpose. 
The content and method of such a course are not so simple. 
The field for possible selection is wide; the time that can be 
given to the subject is limited; the problem is, therefore, one 
of selection. The first determinant in shaping a course of 
study in school hygiene for the normal school is that school 
conditions and practices should be examined with respect to 
their relation to normal development of the child. The injuri- 
ous factors must be clearly defined and the health promotive 
factors must be explained with equal clearness. 
The second determinant is the usableness of the subject 
matter. What can the teacher do with the knowledge thus 
acquired? Is this knowledge largely of matters outside the 
control of the teacher? If so, itis idle. This is not to say that 
it should consist merely, of practical items, the control of 
which lie entirely within his power. It should not be merely 
prescriptive; it should be explanatory and enlightening, but 
it is wasteful of time and energy to deal largely with matters 
that. will not come into the perspective of the teacher. It is 
important to utilize the immediate interests of the prosepec- 
tive teacher and to lead him to understand the relation of the 
various factors of the school environment to the health of 
growing children. 
The very best way of organizing such a course would be to 
have a hygienic model ever present in the conditions and prac- 
tices of the normal school itself and in the training school ad- 
junct, without which no normal school is complete. If in each 
normal school there were exemplified the essentials of con- 
struction and equipment, of organization of curriculum, of 
class management, of methods of instruction, and of personal 
regimen the problem would be greatly simplified. On the one 
hand the teacher-in-training would become habituated to 
hygienic conditions, and would reap the benefits both personal 
and professional that naturally grow out of a life of good 
habits; on the other hand, the school environment would be an 
ever-present laboratory for the first hand study of proper
-P-A-G-E-187
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 187 
hygienic conditions. The method of instruction would be the 
explanation of the function of each important factor in the 
school environment in promoting health. For example, the 
function of proper lighting would be made known by demon- 
stration, by explanation of the several factors involved in ade- 
quate lighting, and by comparison with improperly lighted 
rooms. 
Lacking such ideal conditions, the content of the course 
should consist of an examination of the important factors of 
the school environment in order that the students may under- 
stand their hygienic significance. The laboratory method may 
still be used; the wholesome factors in the school environment 
should be selected for positive demonstration and explanation, 
and the faulty factors as material for demonstrating improper 
conditions. 
The factors of school environment are many and various, but 
for convenience may be grouped into three classes: Material 
equipment, organization of instruction, miscellaneous. The 
first of these includes all the important topics of general sani- 
tation, such as site, the unit of construction, ventilation, heat- 
ing, lighting, toilet sanitation, water supply, also the hygiene 
of such instructional equipment as furniture for the pupils, 
blackboards, maps, gymnasiums, etc. Under organization of 
instruction would be included such topics as fatigue and its 
relation to the distribution of studies and time, home-work, 
discipline, hygiene of the several school subjects—e. g., read- 
ing, writing and drawing with special reference to the eye— 
physical training and exercise. The miscelleanous group will 
include, at least, communicable disease, physical defects, 
nervousness, diet of school children, physical examination of 
children, the teaching of physiology and hygiene, and effect of 
the teacher’s health upon the school. 
In a normal school course not all of these topics would be 
treated extensively. Some would be ignored or merely men- 
tioned. The problem of selection will differ in different normal 
schools. Both in material and in emphasis, a normal school 
preparing teachers chiefly for rural schools must differ from 
an urban normal school . 
The order in which the various topics are taken up is im- 
material.

THE SOUTH AND ITS LITERARY PRODUCT. 
D. F. EAGLETON, AUSTIN COLLEGE, SHERMAN, TEXAS. 
“Tum surest pledge of a nation’s present is her faith in a 
heroic past; and the best guarantee of a nation’s future is her 
full use of her present opportunities.” As Dr. Kent uttered 
these truths to an audience of culture in the University halls 
of Knoxville ten years ago, he summed up in a sentence the 
spirit of our Southland today. 
Here the geniality of the Irish, the loyalty of the Scotch, the 
breadth and foresight of the English, the intellectual acumen 
of the French, the music and romance of the Spanish—have 
all united to give us the most glorious civilization the world 
has ever known. The nobility of the man, the gentleness of the 
woman, the passion of the poet, the eloquence of the orator— 
have all these been so insignificant as to justify the slurs of 
generations upon the South as the land of intellectual mid- 
night, poisoned by the exhalations of a deadly upas tree, the 
home of Uncle Tom and his humble cabin? 
The readiness with which these misrepresentations have been 
accepted is strange beyond belief. It is inconceivable that the 
Puritan with his unsavory record in Britain prior to his trans- 
ference to American soil; with his uncertain military record 
of 1776 and 1812; with superstition and unitarianism sapping 
his intellectuality at a time when national patriotism should 
have been dominant; with his malignant spirit of abolitionism 
that plunged his country into a great civil war—it is incon- 
ceivable. I say, that such conditions should have produced 
the only real literature of this great country of ours, or that it 
should have developed the most stable government the world 
has ever known. 
It is further beyond credence that a motley horde of con- 
victs, gamblers, and drunkards which, according to the ac- 
cepted historians, constituted the early citizenship of Virginia 
and the Carolinas, could have founded a William and Mary 
College, or institutions like the University of Virginia and 
Davidson College, or should have produced statesmen like
-P-A-G-E-189
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 189 
Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and others renowned in arts, 
science, literature—whose names adorn the pages of our na- 
tion’s history almost from the earliest years. Whilst tra- 
ducers have made an unvarying practice of quoting the in- 
famous Sir William Berkley’s saying that “he thanked God 
that there were no free schools nor printing presses in Vir- 
ginia,” with equally unvarying practice do they forget to add 
that his contemporary, the Rev. James Blair, the honored 
founder and President of William and Mary College, “could 
not rest until school teachers were in the land.” 
What are the real facts regarding the South in literature? 
Miss Louise Manly in her excellent little handbook of South- 
ern literature enumerates more than sixteen hundred (1,600) 
writers in the South, whose works are, to a greater or less ex- 
tent, extant. James Wood Davidson in his “Living Writers of 
the South,” issued in 1869, finds 241 Southern writers living 
at the time of the civil war. Of these he claims that some 
have genius equal to the best of our country; others were in- 
differently endowed; and some had no literary power. Still 
the very numbers show the presence of an active literary spirit, 
exerting a powerful influence in erecting the nation’s ideals 
and in moulding the nation’s destiny. 
How is it, then, that such a body of writing is unrecognized 
and unappreciated? The explanation is far-reaching and is 
two-fold. Back in the days of Merrie England, we find a fac- 
tional jealousy, half political and half religious, that was 
transfered to America under the names of “Puritan” and 
“Cavalier.” One found its impersonation in a Webster; the 
other in a Calhoun. The one gave us a Hartford Convention 
and abolition; the other Nullification Acts and secession. The 
“Mason and Dixon” line is not imaginary—it is real and geo- 
graphical, and should be so; real, in that it marks a natural 
segregation of interests; geographical, in that it is a separative 
line between people of political and cultural instincts, and a 
people with trading and materialistic tendencies. Herein lies 
the difference between a Webster and a Calhoun: the former 
contended for wnion—by force, if necessary—for defense and 
other selfish interests; the latter insisted that the only true 
bond of union is in that loyalty which grows out of sympathy 
and affection.    
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
A second explanation is to be found in the industrial pur- 
suits of the sections. Conditions are most favorable to liter- 
ary thought and expression when humanity is brought into 
intimate contact with its kind. Hence, a people following 
manufacturing or other codperative industries will, other 
things being equal, develop more rapidly in their mentality, 
at least along sociological lines; and furthermore will be more 
encouraged to give artistic expression thereto. This was the 
case in New England, a land of factories, of towns, of railroad 
centers, schools and churches, literary and social clubs, newspa- 
pers and magazines, book-making, all tended to develop a liter- 
ary spirit and to give it an expression of aesthetic character. 
As a corollary, it may be added that with the growth of 
thought product there also grew the practice of advertising 
and distributing, by sale and otherwise. This encouragement 
given to the commercial exchange of literary activities was im- 
mense in its results and is the irrefutable answer to the ques- 
tion why one section has a known body of literature and the 
other has not. Our New England neighbors became authors 
and historians for the country at large. They wrote of that 
which they knew; they conjectured of that which they did not 
know; they ignored that which was of no interest to them. It 
is said that New England has made her recognition easy by 
recognizing herself—just what the South has not done! 
“There are no unknown writers in New England, no meri- 
torious productions still unprinted, no important facts unex- 
amined and unrecorded.” 
On the other hand, people in an agricultural country, 
sparsely settled, are not brought into the incisive, competitive 
contact that “sharpeneth the wit and arouseth the emulation 
of spirit.” The individuals, if cultured and idealistic, may 
think the noble thoughts that prompt to noble deeds; but there 
is not the same incentive to the aesthetic expression of those 
idyllic thoughts. And when, in our Southland, such senti- 
ments found their appropriate utterance in impassioned song 
or imaginative verse, it was considered too sacred to become 
an object of deal or trade. Therefore, the expression of South- 
ern life and passion, being without advertisement or sale, re- 
mained within its strictly local confines, and, too often, un- 
fortunately, was relegated to the lethe of oblivion. It is ob-
-P-A-G-E-191
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 191 
viously unjust, however, to draw the conclusion that there was 
no literature in the South; or that intellectuality was lacking; 
or that Southern society and culture had little to commend it. 
Poe, Kennedy, Simms and others were forced to seek Northern 
markets because, in their own land, they could not afford to 
barter romance and sentiment. 
In the light and progress of this latter time we are slowly 
and reluctantly laying aside these cherished traditions. The 
spirit of modern commercialism is taking hold of the hearts 
and habits of the people. Migrant hordes from other lands are 
crowding upon us. The former civilization that we fondly 
dwell upon as “The Old South” is fast passing away; and with 
us, too, all things are for sale. Would that we had more 
Laniers to cry out: 
‘Oh, Trade, would that thou wert dead! 
The world needs Heart, ’tis tired of Head!” 
Let us take a brief historical survey of the field. For con- 
venience we may make the following divisions: The formative 
period to 1789; the period of nationalization to 1870; the 
period of expansion to the present. 
The literary output of the first period was scant and in an 
embryonic stage. The writing habit, like manual labor, was 
largely an imported article in Virginia and Massachusetts 
alike. The first citizens to the manner born had little inclina- 
tion and less opportunity to worship at the shrine of the muses. 
But even this early a contrast sets in; and the chilly pro- 
fundity of a Mather and the sombreness of a Jonathan Ed- 
wards have little in common with the genial humor of a George 
Sandys, the picturesque narrative of a William Byrd, or the 
iridescent fancy of a St. George Tucker. The genius of New 
England became purely “intellectual, self-examining, self-con- 
scious,” almost destitute of the color of emotion or even the 
animus of life. The genius of the South, from its climate and 
its racial elements, was of a richer coloring, warmer blood, 
quicker pulsation. 
When we enter the nineteenth century, the era of national- 
ism, we discover a decided advance in all dirctions; in all 
features of the life of the people. Irving, Brockden Brown, 
Bryant, are well known; but the great body of Southern
-P-A-G-E-192
    192 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
writers of the first half of the century are practically un- 
known. Hamilton Mabie says of the Southern writers: “That 
temperament is strong in the primal qualities of literature: 
passion, sentiment, emotion, humor. It is not afraid of emo- 
tion as the Northern temperament often is. It has a native 
bent toward certain high ideals and has not been touched by 
the frost of the critical atmosphere. There is, perhaps, too 
little criticism in the South; but there is, on the other hand, 
that courage of emotion which all great artists have had. The 
work of these writers shows originative impulses; it is not 
the product of ripe scholarship, nor of a cosmopolitan culture; 
it comes from the-heart rather than from the analytical facul- 
ties; it deals with the universal emotions; believes in them, 
exalts them, idealizes them. It is made of flesh and blood; it 
is, therefore, simple, tender, humorous, and altogether human. 
And these qualities give assurance that it has long life before 
it.” Similar statements from Stedman and other American 
authors show the change of attitude on the part of our North- 
ern critics, as they have become better acquainted with our 
writings. The literature is here; it only needs recognition. 
The contrast in the literature of this period may be indi- 
cated as follows: The writers of the North appear for the 
most part in schools or groups. The social and religious intol- 
erance of the preceding century has developed into the trans- 
cendentalism, unitarianism, and other isms of the nineteenth 
century. This thought, as before, is profoundly speculative, 
hopelessly visionary. 
Southern thought, on the contrary, was from the very na- 
ture of the case cosmopolitan. There were no literary clubs 
nor coteries and, consequently, but little provincialism. The 
point of view was liberal, the spirit fresh, and in his indi- 
viduality, the Southern writer stood self-reliant and creative. 
He read from the great master minds of Europe and often- 
times enjoyed their personal companionship. 
The historical and biographical spirit while not aggressive 
nor self-assertive in the South, was from the earliest colonial 
times, conspicuously present. John Smiths history, from the 
standpoint of originality and popularity was superior to the 
writings of his Puritan contemporary, the great John Milton. 
William Strachey, Secretary of the Virginia Colony, in his
-P-A-G-E-193
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 193 
writings gives a vivid word picture of the three-year old village 
of Jamestown. Robert Beverley’s history of Virginia written 
in 1705, the work of a Virginian on his native heath, is a land- 
mark, reminding the reader that “in the older colonies there 
was now growing up a generation. American by birth, Ameri- 
can in spirit, and molded largely by American conditions.” 
Col. William Byrd’s “delightful literary legacies of the colonia) 
age,” contain, according to Bronson, “the very essence of that 
careless, sunny, freelimbed life of the English cavalier trans- 
fered to the fresher air and wider spaces of the New World.” 
Eliza Pinckney’s letters of the life of South Carolina, written 
in the middle of the eighteenth century, bear testimony to the 
literary culture as well of the spirit of social gayety of that 
wealthy and aristocratic Southern capital. There are others, 
but we must for lack of time pass them by. 
But little native poetry appears in any of the colonies prior 
to the civil war. Strong, vigorous prose is more in harmony 
with the strenuous pioneer life, and it was used with such 
consummate skill that Burke pronounced the Americans a na- 
tion of lawyers. St. George Tucker, of William and Mary Col- 
lege, wrote verse toward the close of the eighteenth century, 
as did Dr. James McClurg, his contemporary. These are still 
known through their lyrics, and still enjoyed, though the 
dirge-like musings of the Tenth Muse, the so-called “Morning 
Star of American Poetry,” have long since been consigned to 
oblivion. 
With the opening of the nineteenth century the forests be- 
came resonant with warblers. Edward Coate Pinckney, Al- 
bert Pike, Mary Shindler, with her “Southern Harp;” Lewis 
Thomas, Amelia Welby, who has well been styled the Mrs. 
Hemans of America; Randall—but the list might be extended 
indefinitely—all true in sentiment, of passionate utterance, 
and correct in form. Dr. Painter observes of these nineteenth 
century poets that they “have been exempt in large measure 
from the narrowing influence of one-sided theological or philo- 
sophical tenets. They have not aspired to the role of social 
reformers; in their loyalty to art, they have abstained from 
fanatical energy and extravagance.” 
As we pass through the ordeal of civil strife we find the 
brightest luminaries; men and women tried as by fire, who 
13

sang their loftiest lyrics amid their deepest sorrows. Father 
Ryan, Hayne, Timrod, Lanier—a wreath of immortelles—what 
of these? Pancoast says that “Lanier’s work is a noble and 
beautiful addition to American poetry, the full worth of which 
is not recognized; and there is none among all our poets whose 
life is more stainless, more lofty, more inspiring. He unites , 
the Southern warmth with the Northern intellect; and, if the 
coming writers of the great region to which he belongs bring 
to their work an equal self-consecration to high ideals; if they 
strive as he did to strengthen the full Southern nature with 
the rigid discipline of thought and knowledge—we may have 
a work accomplished which this poet of the New South has left 
but begun; we shall have a literature more glowing, more pas- 
sionate, and perhaps even more enduring, than that of the New 
England school.” 
The novelist, as the poet, is late in his appearance. John 
Pendleton Kennedy, one of the earliest, is not inferior in power 
and originality to Charles Brockden Brown; and “Horseshoe 
Robinson” is more widely known and more genuinely enjoyed 
today than “Wieland” or “Arthur Mervyn.” Beverly Tucker’s 
“Partisan Leader,” in 1836, was a prophecy and forecast of 
the secession of the Southern States. Miss Warfield, Charles 
Webber, Elizabeth Bellamy, William Caruthers, Miss South- 
worth, Miss Augusta Evans, Marion Harland, Simms, Cooke, 
and others of ante-bellum days show the ability of the South- 
ern mind when turned in the direction of fiction. They com- 
pare favorably with the efforts in other sections and can well 
afford to bide their time. 
Did space permit, we might dwell with profit and interest 
upon the humorists, Longstreet, Baldwin, Bagby and Richard 
Malcolm Johnson; or upon the scientists, Audubon, Maury, the 
LeConte brothers, Joseph Ray, the mathematician; or upon 
the journalists, George D. Prentice, John R. Thompson, James 
DeBow, D. H. Hill, of national literary reputation; or upon 
jurists and statesmen, but our survey must be cursory instead 
of exhaustive and critical. The field is white and inviting, 
but, sad to say, the appreciative student laborers are still 
lamentably few! 
In the earlier days the song birds clustered in such sheltered 
nests as Richmond, Charleston, Nashville and Columbia. But
-P-A-G-E-195

today, from every hilltop and secluded vale, from the busy 
mart and the lonely prairie—come the song, the short-story, 
the State paper, the biographical essay, the critical review, as 
well as the more pretentious novel, history, orscientific treatise. 
The spirit of literature is verily abroad, and it indites a vari- 
ous language. One feels in the present decadence of literary 
power in New England, that “the climate and scenery, the 
history and tradition, the chivalrous spirit and intellectual 
energies of the South contain the promise of an Augustan age 
in our literature.” 
Why are not our writers better known? Thomas Nelson 
Page says, “The harpers were present at the feast, but no one 
called for a song!” “As a people,” Dr. Link laments, “we have 
neither honored our singers, nor treasured their songs; not 
only that,” adds, he, “we have not sought to know if their 
songs had power to charm our ears or inspire our lives.” But 
a change has at last come over the spirit of our dream. The 
focal point of interest in the United States today is the South, 
especially the Southwest. Never before has the dictum of lit- 
erary criticsm been so generous to Southern authors. Maga- 
zines invite them and all avenues are open. 
Our early authors are now being read; and, being read, are 
read again, and edited anew. Our literature now has its op- 
portunity; and one risks little in the prediction that as the 
literature of the renaissant period, and of the national period, 
and especially our formative period, is collated and studied, 
will the admiration of the critical student be increased, as re- 
gards both its volume and its quality. 
What, then, is the manfest duty of our teachers. Whether 
the field of labor East, South, North, or West, there should be 
a broad, optimistic, far-reaching spirit exhibited in the selec- 
tion and presentation of literary productions to our youth. 
Should we, as teachers, confine or limit ourselves to the so- 
called masterpieces, how narrow would be our range! Let us 
get out of the old ruts, seek larger visions, think for ourselves, 
and look to it that our students profit by our thinking—always 
remembering that “pride in past achievement is the great re- 
generative force for the future!”

THE BOY AND THE FARM. 
0. B. MARTIN, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
Iv has been truly said that “Education is not for philosophic 
leisure, and not even for scholarship, but for use.” In any sys- 
tem of public education or mass training this truth impresses 
itself with ever-recurring force. We cannot fail to realize also 
that education is not so much a matter of obtaining knowledge 
as of securing efficiency. The amount of scientific knowledge 
in any line far exceeds the total of gerieral practice in the same 
line. It seems patent, therefore, that demonstration is more 
generally needed than experimentation, and that dissemina- 
tion is more important now to the vast majority than research. 
The greatest work for educators in this generation is to con- 
nect the school and its instruction with the life of the people. 
This is a comparatively new field, but it is a large one. It is 
a free field and there is some room for practical pioneering. 
It is not simply a question of providing special instruction 
for farm boys and girls. In the movement for agricultural 
training is involved the matter of improving the methods of 
training for all boys and girls. It is a question of understand- 
ing of environment, and enlargement of horizon, It is a ques- 
tion of giving sight to those who have eyes, and see not, and 
of furnishing grasp and relish to those who have opportunities 
and resources, and yet know it not. It is not altogether the 
question of keeping boys and girls on the farm, but it is more 
a matter of giving boys and girls everywhere practical knowl- 
edge about, and workable skill with plants and animals, with 
soils and seasons, and with nature and life. It is not a matter 
of so much discouragement when a boy who takes a course in 
an agricultural and mechanical school and then decides to be- 
come a lawyer. He will probably make a sensible, practical 
one, and will sympathize with and know the great body of his 
clients. At all events he will live in the suburbs and have a 
beautiful home with flowers and vegetables and a model farm 
attached. If he should accidentally decide to become a phy- 
sician he will not do less, and he will appreciate Materia
-P-A-G-E-197

Medica and the laws ‘of health quite as much as if he had spent 
four years in the musty classics of other ages. If journalism 
should claim him, or politics, his writing and his work will be 
better because of his acquaintance with the greatest produc- 
tion constituency in his State and nation. If he should be- 
come a merchant or banker, doubtless he would gradually get 
some of his profits into the safest of all investments, real 
estate, and thus avoid the bankruptcy and ruin which fre- 
quently overtake business men in the whirlpool of competition 
and panic. And suppose a boy should be trained to know 
about gardens and orchards and farms and nature and then 
decide to become a preacher. Ah, suppose he should! “Behold! 
a sower went forth to sow!” “A tree is known by its fruit.” 
Every preacher should be required to take a course in agricul- 
ture. It should be put into the theological seminaries. Can’t 
we get up a movement to invite them to take a short course 
in the agricultural colleges? But at least a part of the con- 
cern should be for the poor little fellow who walks the streets 
of the great cities and sells papers for one and two cents a 
copy, and for the girl who stands on her feet all day as a clerk 
in a store for $3 or $4 a week. I visited an establishment last 
week where forty girls were working. The labor seemed con- 
fining, but skilled. I turned to the Superintendent and said, 
“T presume these girls get about $4 a day.” “No,” said he, “$4 
a week.” They were fairly well educated, too. Any one of 
them could take a course in domestic science and soon get 
$1,000.00 a year. I am hoping that the new training in the 
schools, the school gradens in the cities, and the agricultural 
schools nearby, will some day penetrate the crowded tenements 
and the rustling streets to reach the boys and girls, who must 
work long and late, in order to secure the necessities of life 
which are constantly increasing in price. Saving boys and 
girls for independent, useful and virtuous lives on the farm 
will be one of the results of sane education in the schools and 
sensible training out of school. Great opportunities for 
service open up to young men and women, who expect to be 
teachers, if they are wise enough to face conditions and read 
the signs of the time. In fact, whatever the life work is to 
be, it will not be amiss to consider well the trend of education, 
so well expressed by Dr. Hodge in the quotation, “Learning

those things in nature that are best worth knowing to the end 
of doing those things which make life most worth living.” 
One of the greatest administrators of our country says that 
the Farmers’ Codperative Demonstration of the United States 
Department of Agriculture is the greatest system of mass train- 
ing which has been devised. It reaches a quarter of a million 
- farmers directly, and several times more indirectly. It realizes 
the importance of origination, imitation, adaptation and co- 
operation on the part of the membership of the average com- 
munity. It knows that few originate and lead compared with 
the thousands who imitate and follow. The demonstration 
work frequently trains a whole township or county, and in the 
aggregate, will better a whole civilization. 
In all efforts at community betterment it is well likewise to 
recognize the importance of the same truths, and in the same 
manner, appreciate the power of suggestion, of direction, of 
competition, of emulation and of inspection. School officers 
and organizations in hundreds of Southern communities are 
rendering effective aid to the Boys’ Corn Clubs. The army of 
12,500 boys in the South, who have planted their acres of corn 
this year and studied seed selection, fertilization, cultivation, 
etc., will have their ranks more than doubled in 1910. In fact, 
there will be as many as can receive careful attention and 
thorough supervision. This work is not a mere matter of con- 
tests for prizes. It is a plan of continuous study and pro- 
gressive effort. It is a great correspondence school and hun- 
dreds of extension schools besides. 
Dean Bailey has said that “An all round education comes 
from the growing plant.” We have had hundreds of boys who 
have made careful study of corn and then requested bulletins 
on other plants and animals, also particularly adapted to their 
sections. It is a good plan in organizing a corn club to have 
some study at the very first meeting. Some of the most inter- 
esting meetings have been held where each boy brought several 
ears of the best corn he could find and a judging contest was 
held. Some of the most interesting school compositions that 
I have ever read were written by fourteen-year-old boys on 
“Corn Culture,” and I have actually known bashful boys to 
stand up before a courthouse full of people, and tell in good 
English, how they made their crops. I have never read such  
-P-A-G-E-199
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 199 
school compositions when the subjects assigned were “Truth,” 
“Character,” and “Virtue Has Its Own Reward,” nor have. I 
heard such speeches when the most strenuous efforts were made 
to have a successful literary and debating society. The “Boys’ 
Demonstration Work” differs from the school and garden and 
the school farm, in that it is an effort to encourage the indi- 
vidual on his own acre, through the codperation and influence 
of the teacher. It does not require expert or technical knowl- 
edge on the part of the teacher. She can readily read and dis- 
cuss the bulletins of instruction with the pupils at seasonable 
times when said bulletins are sent to all members of the club. 
She can use the great influence of her position to give dignity 
to the work and secure members for the Country Club. She 
can see that the school library contains books and bulletins for 
the boys who want to go further into the study. Our prize 
winning boys, in the various States, did not lose time from 
school, but were the best students. Some of the boys, who came 
to Washington on the prize trip, were back in school the day 
after they returned home. 
One of the most interesting and instructive features of this 
work is the “Exhibit” in the fall. Here is another opportunity 
to give needed aid and instruction to a large number of people 
who gather to witness the boys’ contests. Agents of the United 
States and State Departments of Agriculture, professors from 
agricultural colleges and leading farmers act as judges and ex- 
plain the reasons for their judgment. It is an almost inyari- 
able rule that when prizes are offered to Corn Clubs for two 
or three years, they are extended and offered on other crops 
and, offered to girls also. In many instances a county exhibit 
of the work of the boys and girls has led to the establishment 
of an excellent County Fair. When this work becomes more 
general, vulgar carnivals and hobo circuses will cease to fleece 
and degrade our people. The exhibit idea can be worked by a 
school in a community to good advantage and it is a fine plan 
for school improvement. I have great admiration for the prin- 
cipal of the school at Crete, a small town in Nebraska. He 
asked his Trustees for money to establish an industrial depart- 
ment in his school and was refused. He told the children in 
the spring that he would have an “Exhibit” in the fall, and 
that every child would be expected to “bring something made

or raised” by the child himself during the vacation. The col- 
lection drew a crowded house and was worth the price of ad- 
mission. It consisted in part as follows: Calves, lambs, chick- 
ens, ducks, geese, guineas, pigeons, canary birds, pigs, bread, 
cake, pies, cookies, preserves, aprons, sofa pillow covers, caps, 
hats, collars, ties, coat-hangers, sleeveboards, penholders, boxes, 
chairs, flower stands, wheelbarrows, ladders, and various kinds 
of vegetables, flowers, and field crops. One boy exhibited a 
homemade engine with cars attached, and one twelve-year-old 
girl brought her baby sister to show what she had raised dur- 
ing vacation. That school got its industrial department and it 
is doing well. 
In all efforts at agricultural extension work through the 
schools there is a defiteness and directness for teachers and 
pupils which vitalize and reform. I have read several letters 
from County Superintendents recently which read somewhat 
after this fashion: “I desire to thank you for suggesting that 
I organize a Corn Club in my county. I find that there is new 
life and interest in my work and in the schools. For several 
years I have been making an abstract perfunctory speech, on 
“Wducation” to the schools on my rounds over the county. I 
know the schools must have been tired of it, for I was 
tired of it myself. Inclosed find a list of boys with their 
addresses. Please send them some circulars. I shall talk 
to them about them when I go around again.” There is a 
definite plan about work of this kind. These boys realize they 
are going to school for a purpose. When they go to college 
they will have some idea what they are going for. It is pos- 
sible to do a practical thing in an ideal way, and at the same 
time build character better than is possible with theoretical 
abstractions. I do not believe our schools will lose by putting 
forth a vigorous effort to make education patently profitable 
and universally respected.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE RELATION OF MANUAL ARTS TO THE HOME LIFE 
OR SOCIAL INTERESTS. 
PROF, D. T. KINARD, DILLON, 8. C. 
We will interpret “Manual Arts” to mean any form of man- 
ual or industrial training that is taught in the public schools 
of our country. The bearing or effect that these have on the 
home life, I would say, is in direct proportion to the efficiency 
with which these branches are taught. 
Manual training, in its generally accepted meaning, is a gen- 
eral training, which tends to industrial training. Show me a 
people that are industrially efficient and I will show you a race 
of people that enjoy the real pleasures and comforts of life and 
are happy. 
The effort that a boy puts forth in the school workshop may 
not only lead him on to industrial training, but will cause him 
to think, to act with precision and accuracy, to control himself 
and, hence, build up a firm, strong chaarcter. 
There is often found another class of boys which may be 
reached by the manual work; those boys either who are men- 
tally incapable of progressing further in the academic studies, 
or those who, by reason of neglect or disinterestedness, have 
failed to make their grades and are ready to drop out. If these 
boys can be industrially led, they will go on and learn a trade, 
or even if they are only kept in school a few years longer dur- 
ing that period of adolescence, society has been rendered a valu- 
able service. One such man saved is worth the outlay an hun- 
dredfold. 
As an aid to discipline, take, for example, the use that re- 
formatories make of the manual arts; if a cure for crime, why 
not a preventive? Statistics show that crimes are fewer 
among people industrially efficient. Prison authorities say 
that they have few skilled in manual arts within their walls. 
If the State is so vitally interested in the prevention of crime, 
the interests of home life are many more times interested and 
demand all aid possible from the schools. 
It is not my purpose in this paper to outline a course of 
study in the manual arts, and say just what training for boys 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
202 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and girls should be given in the schools. I am glad that this 
problem is for others to solve. I desire to show that the rela- 
tion of manual arts to home life, is so vital that it requires a 
very necessary and prominent place in the school curricula. 
Not for an instant would I discount the so-called culture 
studies, but I do say emphatically there is no real and true cul 
ture’ without a fair and general knowledge of manual arts. 
And this knowledge cannot be acquired but by contact. 
Does not the student in the woodshop learn the difference be- 
tween real quartered oak and the many cheap and gaudy imi- 
tations? Does not the student in the kitchen learn the real 
food stuffs from the poor and valuless. Does not the student 
in every department of manual arts learn the real, the true, the 
genuine, from the false, showy and oftentimes worthless? He 
learns to discover such things that Ruskin would term as 
“Architectual lies.” 
To my mind, there is nothing that renders more culture value 
to the mind than that which teaches one to distinguish the real, 
the true, the genuine material things of life. 
You frequently hear parents say: “I don’t care for my boy 
to take manual training; I am not going to make a carpenter 
of him.” “TI don’t want my girl to take sewing lessons; she is 
not going to be a seamstress.” Poor deluded, narrow-minded 
parent. The child of such a parent needs education. There are 
two phases to the above situation. One is, that parent con- 
siders his child above anything that looks like manual labor. 
His child needs this training to show him that honest manual 
labor is honorable and that ability to perform manual work is 
not a hindrance to any man or any woman, no matter what his 
or her station in life may be.   I know of no person in any station in life that has learned 
a trade that regrets that knowledge. 
The other phase is, that this parent fails to recognize the sec- 
ond greatest good to be derived from the general manual train- 
ing, or even trades school training that his child would receive, 
and that is, the ability to have work done properly, by know- 
ing how it should be done, having done work himself. For ex- 
ample, I would cite you to men in life. The most successful 
mill Superintendents are those who have learned the mill by 
working through the various departments; the most successful
-P-A-G-E-203
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 203 
railroad managers are those who know the road by personal 
experience; successful merchants are those who have learned 
it behind the counters; successful contractors are those that 
know the trades of men working under them. Many other ex- 
amples are to be found. I would add to the saying, “Learn to 
do by doing.” “Learn to have done by knowing how to do.” 
“To command, one must first learn to obey.” 
T am glad to say that parents like the ones mentioned, are 
very much in the minority. I believe that most parents ap- 
preciate efforts put forth to train their children for the duties 
of life. This is especially true where the teacher gets in close 
touch with the parents and gains their codperation—it aids 
in discipline, in general school work, and opens a way in the 
home for the new and better management of domestic affairs. 
A successful experiment known as “repair day” has been tried 
in some schools. Different broken articles from the home were 
brought in by the students to be repaired in the woodshop— 
such work was very practical and beneficial. It taught these 
students that they could apply the use of tools and their knowl- 
edge of materials, learned in the workroom, to practical use in 
everyday matters. In this way, in many homes, there may be 
saved not only time and money in repairs, but there may be 
many little conveniences added to make home attractive, by a 
boy who would be proud of his work; and, in the doing of this 
work, is not only kept off the street out of bad company, where 
he would be causing trouble for himself and heartaches for his 
perents, but he is getting a training that, in truth, will help 
him in later life to be a home builder and a home lover. A 
man who loves home will work to provide for his home and to 
make home attractive. 
You hear many people argue the questions about whether a 
man or woman has the stronger mind, and whether or not a 
woman can do man’s work, etc.; but all such seem to me an 
idle waste of time. Man has “him-a-sphere” and woman has 
her sphere, but it takes this sphere and “him-a-sphere” both to 
make the perfect sphere of home. 
We have noted some things above about the training of this 
boy who is to be the “bread winner” and some home builder. 
What about the training of the girl that is tobe the home maker 
and home keeper? His success as a bread winner is measured
-P-A-G-E-204
ne ee 
204 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
by the money he earns; his success as a home builder is meas- 
ured by his comfort, happiness and social attainments—and, 
by this, we do not mean necessarily an entrance into “high 
society.” Already, we have given credit to the woman for 
being a larger and more important factor in the home, because 
*tis “The hand that rocks the cradle that rules the world.” 
Her success as a home maker and home keeper is measured 
by the degree of success with which she handles that which is 
provided for the home and her administration of general home 
affairs. The problems that she must encounter are so numer- 
ous and difficult that she must be well trained if she meets 
them satisfactorily. It matters not whether she has these 
affairs to superintend or to do herself—-she must know how 
they should be done. She must know something about a 
house, be it a cottage or mansion. She must know house sani- 
tation; she must have taste of design and color, in order to 
properly select rugs, draperies, etc.; she must know something 
of sewing, selection of textile materials—as to quality, cost, 
etc.; she must know food materials, their food value, prepara- 
tion, manner of serving. And with all these she should study 
the business management of all home affairs. Our women could 
save themselves much work and trouble by systematizing their 
duties. System is a natural acquirement of a manual arts 
student. 
Granting we have the house properly furnished from kitchen 
to parlor and properly kept, and the food properly prepared” 
and served; it is not solely planned for the edification and 
comfort of the home builder and home maker; it is not yet 
a complete home.     
“Young America’? must make his appearance; ’tis for him 
this nest was built. It is upon him that the environments will 
make their greatest impressions, upon him rests the future of 
our country and nation; ’tis he that needs to be trained to love 
that which is beautiful, to “abhor that which is evil and cleave 
to that which is good.” Can we urge too strongly the necessity 
for the proper education of those who are to perform that high 
and noble duty—to be mothers to the young American citi- 
zens? And I mean mother in the highest sense of the word. 
I would not do my subject justice if I did not bring in the 
negro question. One of the most perplexing questions in most
-P-A-G-E-205
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 205 
of our Southern homes is the servant problem. We are depend- 
ent on the negro, and the negro is dependent on us. They are 
with us and with us to stay. Asa race they are dependent and 
must serve their superiors. Why not, then, let’s educate them 
for the work they are todo? If some of our city schools would 
“cut out” about half the book training they are giving and put 
in laundering, cooking and sewing and industrial work like 
this, they will benefit the negro race and the white race con- 
siderably more than at present. 
It is amazing and disgusting to see how our people submit to 
the dirty, filthy creatures that call themselves cooks! How 
many (or few) families would be willing to be judged by their 
kitchens? 
Of many things that impressed me at Tuskegee Institute, I 
think the thing that was most impressive was the fact that 
those in charge made those students keep clean. Would that 
we had more such institutions, not only for the sake of the 
cleanliness they teach, but for the good general training for 
the negro in his station. It is true that his wages would be 
more; he would be worth more. They would be better fitted 
for their work, and would be cleaner and freer from disease. It 
would also create better morals among them. 
Educational people all over our country are beginning to 
realize the importance of just such training schools as those 
we have spoken of above. In many places only some form of 
manual training is given; while in others regular schools have 
been established. To students of this subject I would like to 
commend the stout training schools of Menomonie, Wisconsin, 
which are “organized for the purpose of manual training, do- 
mestic work in the field of industrial education as a part of the 
public school system and supplementary to that system.” They 
also have established a school for home makers. 
In conclusion, we summarize briefly, showing the points con- 
sidered, which are only some of the points that show the rela- 
tion between manual arts and the home life: 
The keeping at school of boys who would otherwise be lost. 
The leading of some into learning a trade who otherwise 
would not. 
As a character builder. 
As teaching right habits of living and system.  
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
As an aid to discipline in the school and at home. 
As an aid in the solution of the negro and servant problem. 
Teaching the ability to do work or have work done. 
It welds a firmer union between school and home life. 
The greatest of all—it is the most important factor in the 
training of the home builder and the home maker. 
Upon this last depends the future success and happiness of 
our American people.

SCHOOL. 
WM. S. MARTEN, 
Director of Art and Manual Training, Durham, N. C. 
From every locality throughout our land do we hear the de- 
mand for industrial educaticn. One has but a glance over the 
reports of conventions, the reports of the various departments 
of education and the articles of our magazines, to see the em- 
phatie and persistent emphasis placed on this subject of educa- 
tion. For this pronounced movement toward industrial educa- 
tion there are a number of essential underlying causes. 
Very briefly, then, some of the essential reasons for the pres- 
ent emphasis on industrial education are: first, the science of 
education has proved that motor training is necessary for the 
best development of the human being; second, because we have 
awakened to the fact that our democratic ideals are in practice 
falling far short of what they are in theory; third, because of 
the great changes lately taken place in our social order requir- 
ing corresponding changes in educational practices; fourth, be- 
cause of the great danger threatening our economic independ- 
ence among the nations of the earth; fifth, because each child 
is a human potentiality with varied possibilities that cannot be 
developed in the same mold, but can best develop along the 
lines of least resistance; and sixth, because the industries rep- 
resent the foundation structure in the social progress of our 
race. For these economical and educational reasons, then, in- 
dustrial education must pervade the whole of our educational 
system.

Industrial training, sometimes called technical training, is 
not directly trade or vocational training. It is not training to 
train toward the industries. It should be a training by the in- 
dustries and toward ‘the industries, but not necessarily for the 
industries. It should be a training by the industries because 
with the codperation of the great manufacturing plants knowl- 
edge can be furnished at first hand concerning industrial pro- 
cesses. It is a training which, according to our latest ideas 
concerning the value of motor training, can be broadly cul- 
tural, and at the same time prepare a boy or girl to enter some 
actual branch of work. The motor training can be directed 
along industrial lines, and this with better results than the 
present ordinary manual training work, because of its definite 
purpose. English, arithmetic, physics, etc., can be intensely 
correlated with it. 
The processes underlying the industries, of the trades and 
of the factories, embrace principles that are essentially vital 
and common to all the industries. These essential principles, 
of physics, of chemistry, of mechanics, etc., must be the ground 
_ work on which specialization must proceed. They can be made 
most vital when shown in their proper relation to the local in- 
dustries. 
In a rural community there must be definite training toward 
the industry of agriculture. The boy and the girl must be 
given definite training that will result in tendencies to stay on 
the farm. ; 
In the cities the high school must train definitely toward the 
industries of that city. In some communities this training will 
be almost wholly toward the trades; in others, this training 
will be almost wholly toward the factories of that community. 
“The present manual training course may be very greatly 
modified by widening the range of materials and tools and 
processes? It should be given more time than is now devoted 
to it in many schools, without in any way lowering the ef- 
fectiveness of the training in the other subjects of the school 
curriculum. This is not a theory; it has been demonstrated 
beyond the shadow of a doubt, and what has been proved in a 
number of school systems under ordinary conditions, may be 
taken as true for other school systems. It means simply a re- 
organization of the course of study; the elimination of non-
-P-A-G-E-208

essentials in the common branches; and the betterment of the 
manual training work in ways that shall lead out to a number 
of vocations or trades.” 
The place of industrial training is, not in a separate school 
with all of its threatening, accompanying evils to our ideals 
of democracy, but in the high school, where it must have a 
place parallel to that of the classical and scientific courses. 
For evident economic reasons specialized industrial training, 
to the extent of trade or vocational training is not possible in 
the high school, just as evidently that trade training is not now 
possible in any but the larger shops. What we must have is 
the codperation of shop and school. To learn a trade or be an 
intelligent factory operative the shop and factory must be used 
in codperation with the school. 
If training toward the industries is taught in separate 
schools many evils, will threaten us: 1. If the special school 
is established to serve special purposes, then those ends will be 
attained in the shortest possible manner. This result would be 
narrowed specilization. 2. Since the schools are mainly main- 
tained by taxation the great expense necessary to equip and 
maintain (even meagerly), the shops of the many seperate 
schools, would create much objection to such work. This would 
do much to hinder the cause of industrial education; while on 
the other hand, one set of well equipped shops under the man- 
agement of the high school would be available and could be 
used by the students in the various departments. 3. Immedi- 
ate chance of economic gain on the part of the child or of his 
parent would cause premature or unwise choice of a vocation, 
thus very much narrowing the future possibilities of that child. 
4. Many diversified schools would tend towards the lack of 
maximum of unity of organization and purpose. 5. Owing to 
the specialization of schools choice of a life work, as in Ger- 
many, would necessarily take place at an early age, and owing 
to a lack of maximum of unity of organization, a change of pur- 
pose on the part of the child, would be more difficult; while in 
the high school a change from one department to another would 
evidently be a much simpler matter. 6. If the high school 
should ignore industrial training at this time of educational 
awakening, it would lose prestige among the masses of the peo- 
ple. 7. The manufacturing interests could readily come in,
-P-A-G-E-209
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 209 
take possession of our industrial schools, and turn it to serve 
their own pecuniary gain. The employers will look to their 
own interests, while we must look to the interests of the chil- 
dren. 8. Lastly and far-reaching, if boys and girls are to be 
divided into classes according to vocations, and educated in 
these separate groups without the feeling of fellowship and 
sympathy, for each other and each other’s work, then we must 
very much fear for the safety of our democratic institutions. 
By all means take over the industrial training into our high 
schools, allow a large part of the time for industrial activities, 
which activities can be made to serve educational ends even 
better than the activities as used in the present type of manual 
training. We would turn out the child well equipped both in 
a cultural and vocational way; and we would give the rightful 
dignity to labor, by uplifting the worker and his. work to their 
true places in our social structure.

THE ETHICAL VALUE OF PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
JESSIE I. WHITHAM. 
Physical Director, Winthrop College, Rock Hill, S. C. 
Puysicax training in its broadest sense means not only the 
training of the muscles and organs of the body, but also the de- 
velopment of the mind and the moral character. No one who 
has been interested in furthering the cause of physical educa- 
tion has failed to lay great stress upon the relation of sound, 
well directed physical training to good moral training. 
In ancient and medieval times this relation was plainly 
recognized. The Greeks were first to believe that a sound body 
makes a sound mind, and they worked toward that end. Gym- 
nastics was one of their chief objects of instruction and 
through this they reached the body and the will. They directed 
their efforts toward the perfection of the body, the mind and 
the moral nature. They strove to make strong, well-rounded, 
self-reliant and obedient citizens. Their educational and moral 
qualifications for the entrance of candidates to the contests 
14
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
were very strict. The games were religious ceremonies, and 
when the contestants were found guilty of unfairness, they were 
made to pay heavy penalties and often scourged. These games 
exerted great influence over all Greece. By the bringing to- 
gether of the wise and great men of the nation, there was a 
general spread of intelligence, while the very spirit and nature 
of the games encouraged a feeling of national patriotism and 
interest, and stimulated the efforts toward the perfection of the 
body, and toward an appreciation of the beautiful, an appre- 
ciation which culminated in the Fidian age of sculpture, the 
most perfect period of art that the world has ever seen. 
In the Middle Ages, the time of chivalry, bodily exercise was 
almost universal. Moral excellence and religious zeal were 
also characteristics of the ideal knight, and along with the re- 
ligious element came the respect and veneration for women, for 
which Medieval Europe was noted. These, however, were not 
the only qualities with which this age was credited. Bravery, 
courtesy, faithfulness and purity were essential qualities, and 
no youth could be dubbed knight until he had fulfilled these re- 
quirements. 
During the fifteenth century physical training began to de- 
cline. A new system of education arose. Intellectual culture 
alone was thought necessary and the body was looked upon 
with contempt. As a result of this retrogression in educational 
methods, science, literature and art declined and religion be- 
came a soulless form. 
With the dawn of the reformation, the civilized world began 
to realize that the neglect of the body tended to produce men- 
tal and moral degeneracy. Martin Luther was earnest in his 
appeal for physical exercise for the people, as it tended, he 
said, toward the prevention of drunkenness, vice and gaming. 
Many prominent and intellectual men of later years, among 
whom were Milton, Locke, Jahn, Gutsmuth, Pestalozzi and 
Rousseau labored in defense of physical training, though to 
little avail. 
A quarter century ago people realized to a fuller extent that 
man without a strong body, no matter how well developed his 
mental faculties, was handicapped, and, therefore, unfit for 
work in life, or as Spencer says, “People are beginning to see 
that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal.
-P-A-G-E-211
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 211 
The best brain is found of little service if there be not enough 
vital energy to work it.” About this time physical educational 
associations were organized in America and instruction in 
gymnastics and military drill was given in several colleges and 
secondary schools and in the graded schools of some of the 
large cities. As time went on and our cities continued to en- 
large, the inhabitants became crowded together and no oppor- 
tunity was afforded for adequate muscular activity for the 
youth of our land; intelligent men and women began to realize 
more and more that something had to be done to counteract 
the tendency to physical and moral degeneracy. Gymnastics 
was put into the grades of most of the city schools, athletic 
leagues were formed, playgrounds were instituted, the Young 
People’s Christian Associations made physical training one of 
their leading features, and nearly every school and college in 
America began to consider this subject one of the most impor- 
tant in its school curriculum, 
Spencer says: “Education is preparation for complete liv- 
ing.” If this is true, we must not lose sight of the fact that 
a good carriage, self-possession, will power, courage and quick- 
ness of thought, should be characteristics of a well educated 
man. These he acquires to a great extent by codrdination of 
bodily movement. 
Athletics probably does more toward the development of 
character than any other form of physical training. It has 
been found that the moral tone of schools and colleges has im- 
proved to a marked degree since athletics entered into the life 
of the student. Some people attribute this to the fact that the 
practice of athletic sports uses up superfluous animal spirits. 
It does more than this, it develops character through the exer- 
cise of moral qualities. Q 
The most attractive feature of athletics is the spirit of com- 
petition. It does one good to struggle for victory and also to 
suffer defeat. Then there is the feeling of loyalty to one’s team, 
one’s class and one’s college and the keen joys of participating 
in competitive games. It calls up all that is exhilarating and 
joyous in life, and these cannot fail to have a lasting effect 
upon one’s character. 
The playgrounds which are being instituted in the crowded 
portions of many of the large cities are doing a great deal for
-P-A-G-E-212
212 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the development of all that is good and noble in the life of the 
child. During play the child’s character develops more fully 
and is more deeply affected than at any other period, and, 
therefore, this is a time when he needs to be carefully guided. 
Children who live in crowded tenement quarters where not even 
the limited space of a city back yard is available for a romp- 
ing space, must have some vent for their activities, and the 
equipment of a number of playgrounds would eliminate many 
of the misdemeanors arising from misdirected energies. Since 
the establishment of the playgrounds petty crimes in the 
juvenile courts have decreased to a marked degree. 
The benefits of the playgrounds can better be set forth by the 
words of Miss Heller, who is actively interested in the work. 
Miss Heller says: “TI believe the playground has come to func- 
tion, not only a vent for precious, though barbaric energy; not 
only as a school for citizenship, and perchance higher politics; 
not only as a laboratory where pedagogues may learn methods 
and economists the signs of the times; not only even as a 
children’s club and commercial center, but as a social dynamo, 
gathering invisible force and transmitting it into vital elec- 
trifying power that shall go thrilling and throbbing to the re- 
motest corners of the community, stirring to the achievement 
of better homes, better children, fuller and better lives, higher 
and more joyous living, which I take to be a great social need.” 
In conclusion: Recognizing the fact that the body is the 
temple of the soul and the mind, let us as educators do what we 
can to make it a noble habitation and one that will aid the soul 
to the attainment of the highest good. The child of today is 
the man of tomorrow, and what we do for the child of today 
will determine the character of the man of tomorrow and of 
the republic of the coming generation.

II. THE FuTURE. 
1. How many will survive? 
(a) The great increase in operating expense will crowd out all ex- 
cept the well endowed institutions. 
(b) An unfortunate location in out-of-the-way communities will 
crowd out many of the smaller institutions. 
(ec) The competition of the State universities will crowd out those 
unable to compete successfully in thoroughness and enconomy. 
2. What will be the character of the surviving institutions? 
(a) They will be strong in equipment, curricula, and faculties. 
(b) They will be broad, free from all sectarianism in instruction, 
though broadly and positively Christian. 
3. Why should they survive? 
(a) To be a symmetrizing influence in education, standing for an 
all-round development of body, mind, and heart, with conservative 
emphasis upon humanitarian and cultural studies.

(b) To be a leavening influence in the educational lump, by a whole- 
some rivalry constraining State and other institutions to exercise 
a sane care for the moral and religious welfare of their students. 
Conciusion: Only the few—the fittest—will long survive; 
but these will be sufficient to carry out their mission and to 
jusify the labors of their founders.

THE CASE OF THE CLASSICS. 
DEAN W. A. HARPER, ELON COLLEGE, N. C. 
No ace has been without its detractors of the past and its 
lauders of the present. The pigmy orators of the Roman Silver 
Age had the self-assurance to prefer the eloquence of their own 
times to the finished excellence of the oratory of Cicero and his 
contemporaries. A similar spirit was manifest at the Revival 
of Learning. Jn our own times the detractors of antiquity 
have gotten the ascendency. 
To this discrediting of the classics in modern education two 
causes have contributed: specialization and the elective sys- 
tem. Per se the classicist has no quarrel with either of these 
ideas. Classical men have always been liberal and charitable 
and open to conviction, and they always will be. They believe 
in specialization and practice it in their own field, but they 
protest against it when it begins in the kindergarten and con- 
tinues to the graduate school. Specialization is all right; the 
exactions of modern scholarship demand it. But it has its 
place, and when it gets out of that place it narrows and 
prejudices. The conclusions of the narrow specialist are viti- 
ated by his narrowness; he cannot see the forest for the trees. 
Nor does the classicist have any quarrel with the elective 
system, when sanely and judiciously applied. He would not 
run all men through the same mold; that would be a sort of 
socialist education ; he is an individualist and would encourage 
individual aptitudes. But he does object to the electve sys- 
tem when it becomes a cloak to hide the laziness of pampered 
ease. He objects to it also when it postulates that one subject 
is as good as another for educational purposes. Nor does he be-  
-P-A-G-E-215
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 215 
lieve that the elective system should begin in the nursery and 
work its way up through the entire fabric of our educational 
life. He objects when it assumes that any one is capable of 
planning a college course, a course that will be far better and 
more practical than one planned by those who have given their 
whole lives to this very thing. He insists that the most practi- 
cal man is the man who puts the emphasis of his life’s prepara- 
tion on man and not on practical. 
Both these contributory causes grow out of the materialism 
of our day. The specialist has in mind to advance his ma- 
terial well-being by confining himself to one thing. The man 
who applies the elective system with the fixed and steady pur- 
pose of mastering his chosen line and not to avoid solid work, 
also has the bread-and-butter proposition before him. The 
gospel of greed is the gospel we practice. Minerva has been de- 
throned, Mercury enthroned, in the sacred halls of learning. 
In our hurry after material success we have become impatient 
at the stately pace of the old education. We have parted com- 
pany with experience, rejecting tradition and traditional 
methods in education as in everything else. We have no time 
for scholarship, unless it contributes directly to material gain. 
We have changed the old educational ideal, “know thyself,” to 
“Succe$$,” with its first and last two letters written with the 
capital dollar mark. This is our shibboleth, and to such an 
extent do some of our institutions of learning practice it that 
to be consistent they should print the dollar mark on their 
diplomas. 
It is impossible to discuss the case of the classics without 
touching on the ends of education, the fines doctrinae discip- 
linaeque, as Cicero would say. Should a man’s education fit 
him to make money merely, or should it also give him a broad 
horizon and a deep spiritual insight by bringing him into con- 
tact with the vast riches of knowledge in all departments of 
learning? Is it the end of education to produce a specialist 
or a citizen? The man who sees nothing in life but work and 
stocks and bonds will leave the classics out of his educational 
programme. The man who sees the work and the stocks and 
the bonds, but also humanity in its larger relations will include 
the classics in his education. 
Just at present the line seems to be tightly drawn between  
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
these two opposing views of the purpose of education and many 
are in doubt of the ultimate issue. The protest against the old 
education was justified, but as in all reform movements, the re- 
formers went too far. And there are unmistakable evidences 
now that the pendulum has again begun to swing in the direc- 
tion of the classics, not that they will ever again occupy the 
exalted position they once held in our educational system, but 
that they will be rated as their real worth requires. 
Every college President recently inaugurated, from Presi- 
dent Lowell down, has voiced the sentiment that classical edu- 
eation cannot be dispensed with without serious detriment. 
They agree with a remarkable unanimity that the attitude of 
the college towards the classics depends upon the attitude of 
the college toward learning. Representative thinkers and lead- 
ers in various lines of life and action have been expressing 
themselves without equivocation in the same direction. Such 
men as Prof. Barrett Wendell, in his book, The Privileged 
Classes; the Rev. Hugh Black, Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, chief of 
the United States Bureau of Chemistry; the late Prof. B. C. 
Bondurant, the Hon. John W. Foster. 
That sentiment is changing in this country in the direction 
of a more balanced valuation of the classics in our educational 
system, the expressions of these men, representative of widely 
different walks of life, seem to indicate. We classicists do not 
deny that the educational reform, which has resulted in the de- 
thronement of the classics, did some good; and we do not wish 
to see the day return when training in them shall be considered 
the necessary badge of a gentleman. But we do insist that the 
educational protestants went too far. They said with truth- 
fulness that the old education was too linguistic, too impracti- 
eal. They have made the new education not linguistic enough, 
too practical. If the old education was like breathing in a 
vacuum, the new is like breathing in a whirlwind, in neither 
of which conditions are the organs of respiration at their best. 
And so we rejoice that sentiment is changing and that we are 
nearing the day when educational equilibrium is to be restored, 
an equilibrum in which the relative value of classical and prac- 
tical education will be recognized and each given its proper 
rating and recognition. 
But there are reasons for this change of sentiment, reasons
-P-A-G-E-217
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 217 
why men are turning again in the direction of the classics, for 
men do not change their notions without sufficient reason. It 
will be profitable, therefore, to set forth briefly the six reasons 
most often advanced on behalf of the classics, and which seem 
to be sufficient to result in their reinstatement in the college 
curricula and their election by an increasing number of stu- 
dents, for be it remembered that statistics reveal a slight in- 
crease in the number studying the classics in both the colleges 
and the high and preparatory schools throughout the United 
States. 
First—The classics are hard. There is no royal road to any- 
thing worth having. What comes easy goes easy. “Per aspera 
ad astra” has long been an honored proverb. As sodawater 
and sillabub do not make strong muscles, so do snap courses in 
college fail to produce strong-minded men. We need Latin and 
Greek because they are hard. They knit the mental muscles 
hard and strong. They should on this account be kept in the 
college curriculum. 
Second.—They develop style. The modern-day pupil cannot 
write a good theme or composition because his thoughts are 
poor and meagre and his vocabulary limited and unliterary. 
These two fundamental defects can be remedied in no way so 
well as by the study of masterpieces in a foreign language, a 
language so far different from our own in thought-conception 
and subject-matter as to require the strictest attention in mas- 
tering it. The English teacher’s best ally, therefore, for teach- 
Ing composition is the classicist. Nor does this influence of the 
classics on style cease with the completion of our school days; 
it continues to be a powerful, molding, beautifying, develop- 
ing force throughout life. 
Third.—They teach word-meaning. Above sixty per cent of 
all the words in the English language are of classical origin. 
The man who thinks anything except the simplest, most pri- 
mary thoughts must use words of Greek or Latin parentage, 
and so the man who knows his classics has a dictionary close 
at hand and ready for reference at any time, and the beauty 
of it is that his dictionary is within and not on the table. 
James Russell Lowell said he missed the meaning of his first 
English word when he consulted his English rather than his 
Latin dictionary.
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Fourth.—They are antidotes for heresy. This is an argu- 
ment brought forward by the brilliant Hugh Black, and is true 
because the man knows well what the world has done in the 
past, who knows the experiments those of other days have tried 
and the conclusions at which they arrived and the results to 
which their conclusions led them, will not be easily swept off 
his feet by every new proposal. Men who have been sobered by 
deep drinking from the perennial fountain of classical culture 
are not so likely to act the butterfly as are those men who have 
had a more varied browsing in the sciences and modern lan- 
guages. Knowledge of antiquity sobers the judgment, acts as 
a ballast for life’s voyage. Heretics have ever been men of 
shallow intellect and poor training, else they ceased to be here- 
tics by fastening their heresy on their contemporaries, and so 
becoming the standard-bearers of a higher and larger truth, a 
result which can be achieved by no poorly equipped man. 
Fifth They develop the judgment. Other studies also dis- 
cipline the judgment in a small way, but the classics train and 
develop it preéminently. The well-rounded man needs train- 
ing in judgment and training in affairs. The latter must fol- 
low the former, or reverse nature’s process. In a Latin periodic 
sentence of one hundred words, what a vast opportunity for 
exercising the judicial faculty. In rendering it in English the 
student must assiduously weigh and measure and contrast and 
compare and balance and exercise selection and make choice at 
every stage of his work that he may be sure he is properly inter- 
preting the passage before him. It will have to be remembered 
in this connection that those who have risen highest in the pro- 
fessions and distinguished themselves on behalf of their fellows 
have for the most part come up “through Latin and through 
Greek.” 
Sixth.—They promote civilization and culture. Culture is 
the sum of the attainments and achievements of a people at a 
time, material, mental, and spiritual. Or, as Mathew Arnold 
put it, “It is knowledge of the best that has been said, done, 
and felt in the history of the world.” And it is advanced and 
fostered by comparison, by contrast, by contact with ideas and 
ideals dissimilar to those of every-day life. When we know 
how the ancient solved certain problems and the attendant 
consequences, we are in position to know how to act today, 
profiting, of course, by their experience.
-P-A-G-E-219

But what interests us most in Latin and Greek is the unique 
part, as profitable as it is unique, they play in the development 
of the human life. We do not argue with the devotees ‘of the 
new education as to the possibility of serving this life by the 
discipline of the sciences and the modern languages. We affirm 
simply that the humane life is most largely generated by keep- 
ing before us the models of those-in whom this life most 
abounded, and that of these models the best and largest part is 
presented to us in the literature of Greece and Rome.

WHY PHYSICAL TRAINING SHOULD BE COMPULSORY. 
W. W. CARD, DIRECTOR. 
Ir is a well known fact that the faculties of the mind and of 
the body are to an important extent dependent upon each other, 
and that a harmonious adjustment of the two is necessary to 
produce the highest type of manhood. Science has proved to 
us that a large percentage of human sickness and suffering is 
preventable by the observance of a few wise and simple laws of 
hygiene and by the right sort of exercise. There are many dis- 
seases which can be warded off by strong physical resistive 
power. Knowing that a strong and healthy generation will 
certainly bequeath the same qualities to the next, it is high 
time we were doing something to make boys and girls stronger 
and healthier. 
Many of our fathers got their strong and vigorous bodies by 
working out in the fresh air in fields and forest, and this occu- 
pation meant a variety of forms of manual labor. Science and 
invention have so systematized and. reduced our labor that in- 
stead of going through many movements that bring into action 
all of the principal muscles of the body we are using only a 
few. If the same occupation is pursued for a long time not 
only will defects of structure be acquired, but even of consti- 
tution and character that may be transmitted to the next gen- 
eration. 
Science and invention have given us many great time and 
labor saving agents, but these agencies are not developing, pro;

ducing and preserving our manhood and womanhood; and I be 
lieve they have a tendency to break down our nervous force. 
We can work longer under low pressure than under high 
pressure. We are suffering from Americanitis. Over-exertion, 
trying to do two things at once, forgetting all about recreation, 
spending energy to get money and wasting energy in spending 
the money, burning the candle at both ends. All these things 
tend to weaken our physical condition. 
If there is nothing done to help the children born under such 
conditions our race will certainly deteriorate. The department 
of physical education or physical training has come to stay 
because of the wise appreciation of the fundamental value of a 
healthy body and its essential relation to a healthy mind. 
The high school that only develops the intellect has fulfilled 
but half its mission and obligation to society and has com- 
mitted a sin not only against the parents and the children 
themselves, but also against generations yet unborn. All insti- 
tutions of learning ought to be held responsible for the physical 
welfare and the health as well as the intellectual training of 
the student. If the students are required to attend chapel and 
recitations, they should also be required to attend the classes 
in physical training. The field for physical training should be 
in the high school, because the earlier you begin this work the 
better will be the result. We plant trees and box them in so 
that nothing will run over them, and we tie them to iron stakes 
so that the wind will not bend their tender young bodies, and 
this is kept up until the trees have grown large enough to 
with stand not only the wind, but the storm. Burbanks’ name 
is known all over America because of his great achievements 
in the flower world. You believe in the improvements of plants 
and boast of what fine stock you have in the pasture. You in- 
vite your neighbors to view your harvest fields, but you are 
silent when it comes to the importance of rearing and develop- 
ing strong and healthy children. Now if much care, pains and 
toil will produce a larger stalk of cotton, a bigger and better 
ear of corn, a more fragrant and beautiful flower and a more 
luscious fruit, why will not as much care, pains and toil pro- 
duce a stronger, healthier and more beautiful child? “Is not 
life more than meat, and body than raiment?” If our schools 
and colleges would only recognize the great importance of  
-P-A-G-E-221

physical training and see that due attention is given to this de- 
partment, it would only be a short time before a big improve- 
ment would be seen mentally as well as physically. But if the 
course of physical training is not made compulsory, it amounts 
to almost nothing. The student should be compelled to do the 
work assigned to better his condition in order that he may 
render himself a more useful asset to society. When our boys 
and girls enter college equally prepared in mind and body, it 
will then be time to talk of devoting all the time to the train- 
ing of the intellect alone in our higher institutions of learning; 
but such is not the case, for we see boys and girls every day 
who are well prepared in the classics and totally ignorant of 
the first principle of physiology and hygiene. Bodily weakness 
is the rule and a sound and vigorous constitution is the excep- 
tion. Only compulsory training in a well equipped gymnasium 
under a competent instructor can remedy this condition. 
Physical training is not narrow in its scope; it endorses and 
recommends all healthful outdoor games. All games, however, 
should be regarded as recreative exercises, a means to an end; 
and this end should be health, strength and power. Athletics, 
as such, is not, as a rule, under the control of the faculty, but 
is managed by the students through their atheltic organization. 
The real object of such training is to train a few (for the num- 
ber is limited), not for the sake of developing and improving 
the individual, but that he may not jump, out run, or out play 
some one else. This athletic spirit is all right if kept within 
bounds and carefully regulated, but it is certainly more to the 
credit of a college to have a hundred men who can make a fair 
showing in games than only a few who can excell. The object 
here ought to be the greatest good to the greatest number, and 
the real aim of the gymnasium is to develop and improve the 
whole student body and to give them as much strength and 
health as possible, so that they may meet and perform the 
duties that await in life. There are Presidents of institutions 
in America who are hiring or employing football coaches as 
physical directors and putting these untrained men over hun- 
dreds of students just because they can develop a winning 
team, and whose brutality can bear down and crush the life out 
of our young men instead of preparing them to have life and 
have it more abundantly. Such folly is really criminal and 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  222, SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should be condemned by every one who has the good of hu- 
manity at heart. It requires as much time and preparation to 
become an expert in physical training as it does in any other 
teaching profession. Men with only four weeks’ work as a 
preparation have secured high salaried positions as physical 
directors just because they could turn out a star team com- 
posed of a few individuals. Developing star teams is all right 
if the methods are not injurious to the men who are taking 
part, but putting athletic coaches who have little or no prepara- 
tion at the head of the whole department of physical training 
should not be indorsed, but condemned by all men who claim to 
be the intellectual guardians of our race. 
All institutions of learning ought to insist on a standard of 
physical development and efficiency and force every student to 
go through enough training to become a good all round man. 
The hope for physical education for the future lies with the 
teachers and those in authority. We must convince them of 
the absolute necessity of physical training as a fundamental 
basis for higher education. 
When practical much of the exercises should be given in the 
open, out of doors; but how are we to correct the many defects 
without special apparatus? The facilities that a well equipped 
gymnasium offers are not excelled or equaled by any other sys- 
tem of exercises. There are two systems of physical training; 
one advocates the principle of antagonizing muscles in free 
movements without apparatus, while the other system claims 
that the resistance offered by opposing muscles is not sufficient, 
and that by using apparatus each group of muscles can be 
worked to better advantage. The latter theory is taught in our 
colleges. A muscle to do its best work must not have a load 
too light or heavy to move, for it has been shown by experiment 
that a muscle in moving its own weight contracts very little, 
and if overloaded it will have the same result, but there was 
an intermediate weight which it lifted to the greatest height 
and thus did the greatest amount of work. Many of the occu- 
pations have a tendency to overwork the flexor muscles, and 
when this is done a restriction and compression of the body is 
produced, thus lessening the internal capacity and interfering 
with the functions of important organs. Just here is a prin- 
ciple that has escaped the notice of many teachers. Muscles
-P-A-G-E-223
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 223 
naturally work from origin to insertion; that is, they act cen 
tripetally. This movement compresses the thorax, lessening 
its diameter, and the only way to remedy this deformity is to 
make the muscle act centrifugally; that is, work from insertion 
to origin, and this done by grasping overhead apparatus and 
pulling or lifting the body. Thus the insertion of the muscles 
becomes fixed, and when they contract they work from inser- 
tion to origin, increasing the diameter of the thorax and en- 
larging the capacity of the chest. Therefore, all well equipped 
gymnasiums have the following apparatus: Low and high hori- 
zontal bars, flying and traveling rings, suspended parallel bars 
and ladders, chest weights, intercostal machines, and back and 
loin machines, etc. There is no apparatus better adapted to 
the general development than the chest weight system. Here 
the weights can be easily adjusted to suit the strength of the 
individual as well as fitted to a particular set of muscles. 
There are groups of the most important muscles of the body 
that cannot be worked properly outside of a gymnasium. The 
drooping head and shoulders, flat chest and a hollow back, 
characteristic of so many students, resulting in a sluggish liver 
and intestines, constipation, undeveloped lungs and a de- 
pressed heart, can only be remedied by adequate apparatus. 
If these faulty postures are not improved a large field for dis- 
ease has been established. Many of these defects have their be- 
ginning in our secondary schools, for it is an established fact 
that physical development and growth is retarded by school 
life, and that organic weakness is produced. The faulty pos- 
ture that results from the child’s attempt to adapt himself to 
the school desk can be easily remedied by a careful course of 
exercise, and if this course is judiciously carried out, the brain 
is renovated and invigorated through its influence upon diges- 
tion, circulation, and respiration. The primary object should 
not be to develop the brain only, but to build up and preserve 
the health of the student. During good and vigorous exercise 
the old muscular tissue is broken down and in its place comes 
new material in greater quantities, thus increasing the size 
and strength of the muscle. No part of the body ought to be 
developed at the expense of the other. Bring into action as 
many muscles as possible and you get a harmonious develop- 
ment. If there is no course of physical training in the high

schools, the majority of those entering college have acquired 
one or more of the following defects: drooping head and shoul- 
ders, round shoulders, flat chest, projecting shoulder blades 
and other abnormalities caused by school life. As these de- 
formities are formed in the early teens, they can be easily cor- 
rected by a ten or fifteen minutes’ drill in light gymnastics, 
such as Indian clubs, dumbbells, wands and free movements, 
and such exercises should be given every day, or at least three 
times per week in the high schools. During this few minutes’ 
drill the blood is drawn from a tired brain and sent through 
all parts of the body, the muscular cells are broken down and 
rebuilt, the organs of digestion are stimulated, and the whole 
system has been renovated and made ready for the incoming of 
oxygen. Deep breathing is not worth so much when it is not 
preceded by some form of exercise, for there must be a demand 
for oxygen before it can be taken up by the blood and dis- 
tributed through the body. 
There must be mentioned the relation between muscular 
movement and lymph. Lymph is one of the main fluids of the 
body. Unlike the blood, it has no special organ to pump it 
along its course. The movements of the arms will cause a 
faster flow of blood through the lower extremities, but this flow 
will not be of special benefit to the muscles that are inactive. 
It has been accepted as a fact by physiologists that lymph is 
propelled through the body by muscular contraction; therefore, 
in order to have a good and healthy flow of lymph the whole 
muscular system must be brought into action. Lymph has two 
main functions, it bathes and soothes the nerve cells and ex- 
cretes poisons. A large supply of nervous energy is somewhat 
dependent on the flow of lymph, and if the poisons are not ex- 
ereted they will be absorbed into the system. High schools 
have recesses and colleges have afternoon hours for recreation ; 
only a small per cent of students take advantage of this golden 
opportunity. The majority are doing absolutely nothing while 
the minority may be overdoing the thing. This over-training 
is more liable to occur in the case of high school boys, because 
of their immaturity. A student should not specialize in ath- 
letics at too early an age, as this may be the cause of skeleton 
defects, and this is also true of gymnastics. Exercise that is of 
the most benefit to children is free play that brings into action
-P-A-G-E-225
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 225 
the large muscles which stimulate respiration and circulation. 
The period from twelve to eighteen is characterized by a more 
rapid growth of the lungs and the heart, and from fifteen to 
seventeen is the special period of rapid growth of the heart 
in relation to the arteries. During this period there should 
be no heavy gymnastic or athletic contests that bring undue 
strain on the heart and lungs, but such outdoor games as ten- 
nis, basketball, baseball and association football. I recommend 
association football as the best game known to develop boys and 
produce organic vigor and efficiency. 
The important bones of the skeleton consolidate between the 
ages of eighteen and twenty-five. Before this consolidation the 
different parts of the frame work are very susceptible to injury, 
but, on the other hand, they are also just as susceptible to im- 
provement and development by judicious exercise. The aver- 
age age of the freshman class at Trinity College for the past 
ten years is 181-2 years. This gives the college somewhat of 
a late start in the process of developing strong, healthy, vigor- 
ous, and efficient young men and women, but if the course is 
made compulsory and judiciously carried out the faulty pos- 
tures can be corrected and a fine all round development can be 
acquired. A good posture means an erect man, with a high, 
deep chest, square shoulders, and a body whose feet move easily 
and gracefully. The physiological defects of a bad posture are 
the following: In the case of a drooping head, there is an en- 
croaching of an angle of the neck on the great arteries that 
supply the brain, and efficient brain work certainly depends 
upon a good blood supply. When this is interfered with the 
quality of the brain is lowered. The sunken, or flat, chest is 
indicative of little vital power, for there is small room for the 
incoming of oxygen. The muscles of respiration that should 
aid the veinous flow feebly perform their duty, producing a 
more or less stagnant circulation. There is little stimulation 
from the movement of the diaphragm to aid digestion. The 
movement of the involuntary muscles along the digestive tract 
is retarded by the lax state of the abdominal muscles, thus in- 
terfering with the absorption of food and producing intestinal 
constipation which is one of the worst forms of this malady 
and the hardest to overcome. Thus we see that the process of 
transforming bread and meat into good red blood is poorly 
15

done and we do not wonder that one only half lives. Such a 
process is destructive instead of constructive. 
We are beginning to realize that the care of the body is a 
prerequisite in many cases to the moral uplift of the soul. 
The two go hand in hand. We are living in an advanced age, 
an age of wholesome, sane and intelligent living. People in 
general are becoming wiser and they demand more intelligent 
information about these things. We are spending millions 
every year for cure and hundreds for prevention; but by spend- 
ing the millions for prevention we should only need the hun- 
dreds for cure. 
If you will allow me to do so I will cite one concrete case 
showing what a student may accomplish by regular work dur- 
ing his four years in college. The measurements of this young 
man (twenty-six years old) on entering college and four years 
later are as follows:

Dr. Sargent, of Harvard, says that “When men shall have 
learned that much of the ill temper, malevolence, and unchari- 
tableness which pervade society arise from feeble health, and 
that the great mental and moral disturbances which sometimes 
threaten the stability of a government may be traced to physi- 
cal causes, then will the training of the body rival in dignity 
and importance the training of the mind, for the inteersts of 
mind and body will be recognized as inseparable.”

When we add to our intellectual attainments bodily vigor, 
which is the foundation for long life and service, we shall have 
found the secret which will dispel the monotony of our daily 
lives, and arrest the physical deterioration of our race. 
Just so long as the coming generations must succeed the 
present and take their place in the line of battle, and not only 
bear their own burdens, but help bear the responsibilities of 
others, and as long as our boys and girls must become the 
fathers and mothers of the future generations, so long will I 
advocate the prime necessity of compulsory physical education 
as well as mental. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER. ] 
WHAT BECOMES OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS? 
SUPT. R. H. LATHAM, WINSTON-SALEM, N. C. 
Tue data in the Department at Raleigh not being sufficient 
for the purposes of this investigation, I prepared a set of ques- 
tions covering the ground and sent them to 200 schools, 82 city 
and town (public) high schools and 118 rural (public) high 
schools. Every section of the State was represented. Replies 
were received from 96 schools, 44 city and town high schools 
and 52 rural high schools. The 96 schools represent 61 coun- 
ties, the 44 city and town high schools representing 35 coun- 
ties and the 52 rural high schools representing 39 counties. Six 
city and town high schools and fourteen rural high schools 
were not able to furnish records complete enough for use. So 
our investigation is confined to the reports of 76 schools with 
an enrollment of 4,503 students in 55 counties. The 38 city and 
town high schools with an enrollment of 3,246 students repre- 
sent 33 counties, the 38 rural high schools with an enrollment 
of 1,257 students represent also 33 counties, though, of course, 
not the same ones. These city and town high schools are scat- 
tered over the State; the rural high schools are largely east of 
Charlotte. 
In Tables I and II below is shown the enrollment by years 
and by sexes of these high school students, and their present 
distribution. In Table III is shown the number of graduates 
in 1908-1909, the number of these who went to college, and the
-P-A-G-E-228

number unaccounted for. The number of graduates marked 
“missing” seems large, and no doubt many, if not all, of these 
could be acounted for had I asked the specific question. I 
found out my oversight too late to recall. Assuming that the 
whereabouts of these 81 graduates of the city and town high 
schools and the 19 graduates of the rural high schools could 
be given, we must make proper changes in the totals of those 
absent from school for “unknown causes.” Table IV presents 
the data of Tables I and IT in percentage form. 
In the city and town elementary schools, commonly called 
graded schools, we find for 1908-1909, the number of years in 
the course to range from 6, 6-12, 7 to 8 years. Seven was the 
prevailing length. These school years were 28, 32, 33, 34, 36 
and 38 weeks long. In these elementary grades were not less 
than 15,000 pupils (estimated), taught by 13 men and 287 
women. One school reports 533 pupils taught by 8 women, an- 
other school reports 35° pupils taught by two teachers (one 
male and one female). The enrollment per teacher lies be- 
tween these limits, 66 and 17. Nine of the 13 male teachers 
were in two cities, so that in only four cities and towns out of 
36 were men found doing elementary work. 
In the rural elementary schools we find the number of years 
in the course to range from 6 to 61-2, 7 to 8 years. Here also 
the prevailing length was seven years. These school years were 
24, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 40 weeks long. One school reports an 
elementary course of 7 years of 40 weeks, another 7 years of 24 
weeks. Each of these schools had a high school of 3 years of 
40 and 24 weeks, respectively. The school with a term of 24 
weeks graduated 4 boys and 1 girl last year, and they are all in 
college this year. The school with a term of 40 weeks gradu- 
ated 4 boys and 4 girls, and of these 1 boy and 2 girls are in 
college. In the elementary grades of the rural schools were not 
less than 5,000 pupils (estimated), taught by 3 men and 108 
women. One school reports 163 pupils taught by 2 women, an- 
other 24 pupils taught by 2 women. The enrollment per 
teacher lies between these limits, 81 and 12. The three male 
teachers were in different schools. Fifteen of these rural 
schools report two women doing all the work of the seven 
grades. One school reports two women giving full time, and 
one man and one woman each giving part time, to the work
-P-A-G-E-229
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 229 
of the eight grades on which the high school is based. The 
greatest number of teachers in any rural school reporting 
was 8. 
The picture of the high schools will repay a close inspection. 
In the city and town high schools the course of study, for 1908- 
1909, covered 1, 2, 3, 31-2 and 4 years. Eighteen of the thirty- 
eight schools report a 4-year course, thirteen a 3-year course, 
one a 3 1-2-year course, five a 2-year course, and one a 1-year 
course (a new school). One 2-year course has been raised to a 
3-year course this session, and three 3-year courses to 4-year 
courses. The length of the school year was either 32 or 36 
weeks as a rule, sixteen schools reporting 32 weeks and fifteen 
reporting 36 weeks, only one school reporting 28 weeks. In my ~ 
opinion, the city and town high schools are tending toward a 
4-year high school based on a 7-year elementary school of 8 or 
9 months. The length of the recitation period varied from 
30 to 45 minutes, 40 minutes being the prevailing length. The 
3,246 students in these high schools were taught by 151 teach- 
ers, 63 male and 88 female. Forty-two men and 70 women gave 
their whole time to this work, and 21 men and 18 women gave 
part time. Two schools were without male teachers. One 
school reports one teacher (male) to 8 students. Another re- 
ports four teachers (two male and two female) to 153 students. 
The enrollment per teacher lies between these limits, 8 and 38. 
One hundred and fourteen of the high school teachers held col- 
lege diplomas, forty-one held normal school diplomas, eight had 
at least one year of college or normal training. Every teacher 
had been to college or a normal school. The salaries of the 
principals varied from $320 to $1,750. The $320 salary was 
drawn by a woman who, holding both college and normal 
diplomas, gave her whole time to high school work. The $1,750 
salary was drawn by a man well known in the State. It is only 
fair and just to say, however, that the salary of a large ma- 
jority of the principals was $600 and over. Thirteen schools 
have new. principals this year, seven have had their principals 
two years, six three years, two four years, three five years, and 
one seven years. Seven schools have new Superintendents this 
year, nine have had them two years, eight three years, one four 
years, four five years, two six years, one seven years, one nine 
years, and two eleven years. One of the high schools reporting
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
has been in existence sixteen years, one eleven, two ten, two 
nine, one eight, two seven, two six, seven five, one four, ten 
three, and two two years. I greatly regret that no statement 
of any particular value can be made as to the salary of high 
school teachers. This question was unanswered in many re- 
ports, and in others the estimate evidently includes the salary 
of the principal. It is sufficient to say that some salaries were 
distressingly low, while others represented a fair living wage. 
No accurate estimate of the cost of conducting these high 
schools is possible with the data at hand. 
Twenty-eight of the city and town high schools had no 
laboratory in 1908-1909. There were laboratories in ten 
schools, and one more has been put in this year. Twenty-nine 
schools offered as much as one full year of science, and one 
more will offer it this year. Twelve schools offered as much 
as two years of French or German, and five more will do so 
this year. Only two schools offered manual training, and one 
more is doing so now. Highteen schools offered music, two 
more will do so this year, but two that offered it in 1908- 
1909 will not do so this year. Three schools offered a business 
course last year, and will continue it this. The course covered 
two years in two cases and one year in the third. Comple- 
tion of the elementary course was necessary for entrance on 
this course in two cases, but not so in the third. Two other 
schools will offer a business course this year, completion of 
the elementary course being necessary in one case. Latin 
seems quite secure in our city and town high schools, judging 
by the number of schools that require it. Twenty-seven of the 
thirty-eight high schools required it throughout the course in 
1908-1909, and not a single conversion is reported. Two 
schools required it for the first two years. Another school re- 
quired it “except in cases of stupidity.” Only eight schools of- 
fered Latin optionally. Promotion in five schools was by units, 
in fifteen by subjects, in seventeen by years, in one by “ability.” 
In 1908-1909 fifteen schools had no literary society, but six of 
these have societies now, and two that had gave them up. 
Only three schools were without libraries last year, and these 
three have them now. The attitude of the high schools toward 
athletics ranges from “no interest” and “not crazy” to “en- 
couraged.” The attitude in general is favorable, certainly no 
hostility is expressed.

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 231 
When we look at the rural high schools we find that some 
conditions are very gratifying and others far from so. I shall 
cite some extreme cases to show how easy it is to build up 
two theories directly opposed to each other, if one takes ex- 
ceptional cases to work with. If you select your cases, you 
can prove anything you please. And the man given to aver- 
ages can build his theory and find fault with the whole busi- 
ness. 
In the rural schools in 1908-1909, the course of study covers 
1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Fourteen of the thirty-six schools answer- 
ing this question report for 1908-1909 a 4-year course, ten a 
3-year course, eleven a 2-year course, and one a 1-year course 
(on account of age of school). The 1-year course has been 
changed to a 2-year course, and two of the 2-year courses to 
3-year courses. The length of the school year varied from 24 
to 40 weeks, the prevailing length being 32 weeks. Hight 
schools report a school year of 36 weeks. Probably the nearest 
approach we can make to fixing the character of the rural high 
school is to say that it is one offering a 3- or 4-year course of 
eight months, based on an elementary school of seven years of 
eight months. The length of the recitation period varied from 
20 to 45 minutes, 30 minutes being the most common length. 
Nine schools report 35-minute periods and five report 40-min- 
ute periods. The 1,257 students in these rural high schools 
were taught, in 1908-1909, by 65 teachers, 36 male and 29 
female. Thirty-one men and six women gave their whole time 
to this work, and five men and twenty-three women gave part 
time. Three schools report no male teachers, and eleven were 
without female teachers. One school reported one teacher 
(male) to 12 students. Another reported one teacher (male) 
to 85 students. The enrollment per teacher lies between these 
limits, 12 and 85. Fifty of the rural high school teachers held 
college diplomas, twenty held normal school diplomas. With 
one exception every rural high school teacher reporting held 
either a college or a normal diploma, or both, or had had at 
least one year of college or normal training. One man, who has 
been principal of a high school for three years (the age of the 
school), who gave his whole time to high school work with 19 
students, and who received a salary of $90.00 per month for 
eight months, has never been to a college or a normal school.

He holds only a teacher’s certificate. But the training of our 
rural high school teachers is very far above what unthinking 
people think, or say they think. The salaries of these rural 
high school principals vary from $350 to $1,200. The $350 
salary was paid to a woman who holds both college and normal 
diplomas, and who gave her whole time to high schol work with 
39 students. She had a man and a woman under her teaching 
the 110 pupils in the elementary grades. The $1,200 salary was 
drawn by a college man: who has been with his school since its 
establishment two years ago. It is probable that the majority 
of rural high school principals received in 1908-1909 as much 
as $700. Thirteen schools have new principals this year, eight 
have had their principals two years, eleven three years, three 
four years, and one six years. One of the high schools report- 
ing has been in existence fourteen years, one nine, one seven, 
one six, one five, three four, twenty-two three, and four two 
years. The data received will not permit us to say much about 
the salaries of rural high school teachers. The figures given 
for male teachers are no doubt largely those of the salaries of 
the principals. The salaries of the female teachers varied from 
$166 to $520. The $166 salary was paid to a college and a nor- 
mal graduate for nine month’s work. The principal of her 
school (a man), who is not a graduate, got $720. Another case 
is reported where the woman teacher, who is a college and a 
normal graduate, received $200 for eight months’ work. The 
principal of that school (a man) got $800. Let me hasten to 
say, to allay just indignation at such hoggishness, that both of 
those schools have new principals this year. We find a brighter 
side when a woman high school teacher is paid $520 for eight 
months’ work, $65.00 per month. The female rural high school 
teacher in 1908-1909 received, on an average, not far from 
$350. The estimated cost of conducting the rural high schools 
varied from $400.00 to $2,000.00, the majority costing in the 
neighborhood of $1,000 a year. 
Only one rural high school had a laboratory in 1908-1909, 
one more has been put in this year. Twenty-one schools offered 
as much as one full year of science last year, four others are 
doing so now, but one has given it up. Twelve schools offered 
as much as two years of French or German in 1908-1909, three 
others are doing so this year, but one had to give it up for lack
-P-A-G-E-233

of teaching force. Only one school offered manual training a 
year ago. This rural school has a laboratory, offers a full year 
of science, two years of French or German, a music course, 
and a business course of one year. Domestic science was not 
taught in 1908-1909 in any school reporting, but one school has 
it now. Twenty-eight schools offered music last year, two 
others do so this year, but five had to give it up. Two schools 
offered a business course in 1908-1909, but one of these had to 
give it up. Last session thirty-two out of thirty-seven schools 
reporting required Latin. This year two others have made it 
optional. In 1908-1909 in five schools promotion was by units, 
in twenty-two by subjects, in eleven by years. Two have 
changed from years to units. Last year twelve schools had no 
literary society, six have added societies, but three gave them 
up. Only two rural high schools were without libraries in 
1908-1909, and this number is now reduced to one. ‘The atti- 
tude of the rural high school toward athletics varies from “no 
interest” to “enthusiastic.” Football is on the blacklist in one 
school. 
Such are the seventy-six high schools through whch these 
4,503 students have passed, and are now passing. Keeping 
these conditions in mind, we can look more understandingly 
at the four tables I have presented to answer our question. Let 
us see what our investigation has disclosed: 
1. More attention should be given by Superintendents and 
principals to the progress of pupils through the schools. 
2. Six city Superintendents and fourteen rural high schooi 
principals went to new fields of work this year, and found no 
records at all or data insufficient to answer the questions. 
3. It ought to be the duty of every Superintendent or prin- 
cipal to keep records showing at least name, sex, parent, age, 
and grade of pupil upon entrance, and these records should be 
continued to show whether the pupil is promoted or not from 
year to year; when the pupil withdraws an entry should be 
made giving the cause. 
4, For high school students the facts called for in (3) should 
be given, and in addition a complete and clear statement of the 
work done in each subject in each year of the high school. If 
the student withdraws before the completion of the course, 
that fact and the cause should be stated. If the student com-
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
pletes the course, that fact should be stated, and, if known, his 
whereabouts at the opening of the next school year should be 
given. Whenever possible this record should be continued for 
three or four years. 
5. Much loss of time and many mistakes could be avoided 
by the keeping of such records. They will be of great service 
to the Superintendent or principal making them; and profes- 
sional courtesy, if nothing else, demands that we leave behind 
a record of the werk done for the use and convenience of our 
successor. 
6. Each Superintendent or principal should be required to 
file each year with the Department of Public Instruction the 
names and addresses of the graduates of his high school. This 
list should be accessible to the proper authorities in colleges 
of recognized standing upon payment of cost incident to copy- 
ing. This plan would be far more satisfactory to the colleges 
than their present ineffective method of sending blanks to the 
different schools; and there would be no further demand upon 
Superintendent’s and principals for such information. 
7. The word “graduate” in North Carolina means a student 
who has done anywhere from twelve months of high school 
work under one teacher to thirty-six months of work under 
four teachers. This is all wrong, and the colleges are in a meas- 
ure responsible for, and ought to help to remedy, the wrong. 
In 1908-1909 there were thirty-two 2-year graduates in 
seventy-six high schools, and nineteen of these are in college 
this year. 
8. Less than one in eleven graduated from the city and town 
high schools, and less than one in twenty from the rural high 
schools in 1908-1909. 
9. In 1908-1909, thirty-eight city and town high schools 
turned out 268 graduates, and 69.8 per cent of these are now in 
college. At the same time thirty-eight rural high schools 
turned out 51 graduates, and 62 per cent of these are in college 
now. 
10. The colleges got 219 of our high school graduates of 1908- 
1909. This represents 5.7 per cent of the city and town high 
school students, and 2.5 per cent of the rural high school stu- 
dents. 
11. The colleges took 162 of our high school students of 1908-
-P-A-G-E-235
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 235 
29 1909 without a certificate of graduation. This represents 3.5 
per cent of the city and town high school students, and 4.3 per 
cent of the rural high school students. 
12. In our city and town high schools for 100 girls there 
were only 75 boys in 1908-1909; in the rural high schools for 
100 girls there were 89 boys. 
18. Of the city and town high school graduates, the per- 
centage of girls in college is the larger; the contrary is the case 
among the rural high school graduates. 
14. Out of 100 students in the city and town high schools in 
1908-1909, only 53 are doing the work of the next higher grade 
in 1909-1910; in the rural high schools only 40. If those stu- 
dents who graduated and are in college this year are regarded 
as doing the work of the higher grade, these figures become 59 
and 42, respectively. 
15. Out of 100 students in the city and town high schools 
last session, 10 are doing the same work over this year; in the 
rural schools 15. 
16. The private schools got 2.6 per cent of the city and town 
high school students, and 2.1 per cent of the rural high school 
students. 
17. By removal from the community 2.3 per cent of the city 
and town high school students and 2.6 per cent of the rural 
high school students are out of school or in a different school 
this year. 
18. The city and town high school lost 2.6 per cent and the 
rural high schools 4 per cent of their students, because those 
students or somebody said they had to go to work. 
19. The desire of going to work took 2.4 per cent of the city 
and town high school students and 3.5 per cent of the rural 
high: school students. 
20. Lack of ability caused 1.4 per cent of the city and town 
high school students to withdraw, but the percentage among 
the rural high school students was less than 1. ; 
21. Indifference removed 1.3 per cent of the rural high schoo] 
students, but the percentage among the city and town high 
school students was less than 1. 
22. The rural high school students furnished more than 1 per 
cent of their number to the teaching profession. These are not 
graduates. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
23. For unknown causes 13 per cent of the city and town 
high school students and 19 per cent of the rural high school 
students of 1908-1909 are out of school this year.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
WHY THERE SHOULD BE DEFINITE STANDARDS FOR 
ENTRANCE UPON TEACHING. 
SUPT. C. L. COON, WILSON, N. ¢. 
Iv is not necessary in this presence to make an argument for 
trained teachers in our schools, or to show that trained teach- 
ers is the greatest single need of modern life. So far we are 
all agreed. But we immediately raise more tongues than con- 
fused the air around the tower of Babel when we begin to dis- 
cuss how we shall secure only trained teachers for the children. 
Immediately we encounter the emotionalism which tells the 
public that teachers do more work for less pay than any other 
class. You would think to hear this plaintive wail that all 
society and the powers that be, together with all spirits good 
and bad, had banded together to keep teachers poor and hum- 
ble, merely because they are teachers. For one, I do not believe 
society has anything serious against true teachers. There is 
a good reason why teachers’ salaries are poor everywhere, 
which reason is the simple one that the great majority of those 
who teach are unskilled laborers. This is the economic fact at 
the bottom of this whole question. And teachers have it in 
their own hands to change the conditions which make them 
merely unskilled hired persons, when they get ready to do so. 
Those who favor any real measures to secure trained teach- 
ers are also met with another class of educational doctors. 
This class is also numerous and influential. They are our edu- 
cational Scribes and Pharisees, who proclaim that the first 
place to begin educational reform is not upon themselves and 
their own Jerusalem, but upon John Smith and the dear Gen- 
tile people like him. These modern educational preachers of 
the duty of the public toward teachers tell us we must get the 
State and the local districts to vote higher taxes first, and 
that the good teachers will follow such action as day follows 
night. Yet all of us know that the great majority of the teach- 
ers who are employed in such favored localities are raw, inex- 
perienced young women, who do not dream of teaching longer 
than a few years.
-P-A-G-E-241
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 241 
High school taxes are at present no specific remedy for the 
untrained teacher, and what the untrained teacher stands for. 
You cannot eradicate the hookworm by administering health 
tonics, as was ignorantly done for years before Dr. Stiles dis- 
covered the disease and medical science prescribed the remedy, 
any more than you can, by plaintive wails about poorly paid 
teachers and small school funds, eradicate the disease of poor 
teaching. 
But how are we to secure trained teachers? I shall try to 
set forth the remedy in all simplicity. First of all, we must 
recognize that our educational conditions must be remedied, 
not primarily by appeals to the general public, though there is 
a place for such appeals, while we remain indifferent to our 
collective professional advancement and the professional prepa- 
ration necessary to enter upon the work of teaching. We must 
go boldly about the task of our own improvement. We must 
say to those who will not mend their professional ways, “You 
must give place to the man who can do a better job.” The man 
who had one talent and improved it not was separated from 
even that which he had. This is not a cruel law; it is the only 
path to real progress. 
In the work of remaking our profession, we shall neces- 
sarily have to provide some State standards for entrances upon 
teaching, instead of the local, unsatisfactory standards which 
now obtain everywhere. We shall have to protect the public 
from pedagogical incompetence and ourselves of the profession 
who desire betterment from those who would use it as a tem- 
porary means of making a living. Public policy demands this 
much of the true teachers of this day and generation. Upon 
whom will the public put the odium of not leading in this glori- 
ous work of the professional advancement of teaching, except 
upon the real teachers of the present? 
Can any one,give one good reason why there should not be 
some definite standard of mental, moral, and professional 
qualification for entrance upon teaching, State-wide in its ap- 
plication? We all know what qualifications a candidate for 
medical practice must have; we know what a candidate for 
legal practice must meet in the way of qualifications. And, 
when a doctor or lawyer is licensed, he is a doctor or a lawyer 
everywhere in North Carolina, for all time, if he behaves him-

self as a decent citizen should. As matters now stand in North 
Carolina as to the making of teachers, we have some 200 Super- 
intendents who have absolute control of the making of purely 
local public school teachers for terms of one and two years 
only. And behind these Superintendents are the School 
Boards who may unmake the Superintendents at intervals of 
ene and. two years. Can any one imagine a system more fruit- 
ful of confusion, more susceptible of the whims of popular 
ignorance or more destructive of professional pride? Because 
we have endured these ills for so long we imagine there is no 
remedy. But there is a sure remedy. The beginning to apply 
the remedy is to set some standard which all who would teach 
must meet. This standard must be State-wide in its applica- 
tion, and the control of its enforcement must be in the hands 
of real teachers. This standard will necessarily have to be 
progressive and graded, because we cannot now put the stand- 
ard for all teachers as high as it should be on account of the 
very conditions I have been describing. 
But you say: “How will you raise the standard for teach- 
ing and make it definite, on the present low salaries?” If you 
will observe, you will find low salaries equally the rule for 
every trade in which the great majority of those who follow 
that trade are unskilled and unorganized. But what would 
happen were we to make all teachers skilled and then control 
the supply? Skilled workers always command good wages, 
unless they must compete with unskilled labor, which is the 
condition which now confronts every skilled worker among us 
—he must sell his skill in the market with the unskilled ma- 
jority. And still do you doubt the result of making all teach- 
ers skilled workers in immortal stuff? Then, think a minute! 
The Lord of the earth makes every human being ignorant. 
This means that the demand for the teaching is as great as 
humanity itself. Now, suppose we control the supply of 
skilled teachers to meet this natural demand, have we not 
absolute control of the demand and the supply—the two 
economic elements which determine the price of everything? 
I take it, therefore, that if we resolve that all teachers shall 
be skilled workers, this salary question will be the smallest 
problem we shall have to meet along the road which leads to 
the goal .

WHAT EQUIPMENT SHOULD A CHILD HAVE AFTER 
TWO YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN EXPERIENCE? 
LAURA E. WHITNEY. 
“I am old, so old, I’can write a letter, 
My birthday lessons are done. 
The lambs play always, they know no better, 
They are only one times one!” 
In this stanza from Jean Ingelow’s “Song of Seven,” she 
puts into the mouth of the child an expression of his con- 
scious awakening and longing for a more concentrated and 
self-directed manifestation of his inner life. All kinder- 
garteners are familiar with these premonitions of the child’s 
sense of power in the closing year of his kindergarten experi- 
ence; his mind might be likened to a seed potent with possi- 
bilities; at first, under fostering conditions, it sends out seek- 
ing tendrils as delicate as a breath of life, and in the sunshine 
of sense stimulation and emotional reaction in self-active 
play experience. These wax strong and vigorous, and reach 
out and up in the effort to attain and conquer the beyond , 
and unseen. 
With development of the child’s imagination comes power 
to understand the abstract as well as the concrete, and work 
becomes desirable as the mind is able to image the result of 
work, and see the finished product in the crude material. 
Self-activity is from the earliest manifestations called into 
greater efficacy through the resistance of an opposing force, 
and just as the child’s physical nature grows into co-ordinated 
strength, through the efforts and repeated struggles of the 
treeping and walking period, there comes a time when the 
child’s mind begins to hunger for something beyond its un- 
folding power, and through experiences and associations 
(many of them difficult and hard), reason and the stable men- 
tal processes are attained. 
If the kindergarten could always keep a chart of each 
child’s progress, as the trained nurse records the progress of 
her patient, what a wonderful revelation it would be at the

end of two years’ work; wavering and uncertain in the begin- 
ning as pulse beats, now a high hopefulness, again seemingly 
at a standstill; perhaps after quite a period of normal develop- 
ment a sudden depressing fall into shyness, self-consciousness 
or stubbornness. Little by little that delicate thing, the per- 
sonality of a child, is revealed. 
The second year the problem is of a different order, usually, 
and the careful teacher sees where pruning and repression 
must be used for some of the very qualities she has worked so 
hard to stimulate in the previous year. 
For normal average children, the two years from four to 
six seems to be the proper kindergarten age, and it is such 
children we will consider here, and endeavor to sum up the 
equipment which should be given in that length of time in 
order to send the child into the school, ready for the next 
things, and to be a desirable and welcome member of his 
environment. 
Every kindergartner has had her heart made sore by the 
assertion that primary teachers do not enjoy having kinder- 
garten children enter, and is familiar with the charges made 
concerning the effects of kindergarten training; all of which 
are very true as applied to individual children, but which 
should not condemn a system so broad and uplifting in its 
general principles as that of the kindergarten, at least with- 
out most careful study and investigation. Individual teachers 
. may fail in having the grasp and insight to present any given 
method of training; there may be reasons why certain children 
have failed to exemplify the teaching they have been given; 
but kindergarten as an educational system, as a social source 
of uplift, as a moral and spiritual influence in the community, 
as an effort for self-active good, whether it is in the home, 
the school-room, the city, the State, or in the hearts of its 
promoters and the children who benefit from its humanizing 
influence, kindergarten has come to stay. And we, who 
believe in it most loyally, are, or should be, fully wide awake 
to its deficiencies and work untiringly toward more con- 
secrated, able and intelligent presentation of its true prin- 
ciples. 
What are some of these assertions, made in regard to kin- 
dergarten children?
-P-A-G-E-245

1. Dependent upon the help of others and lack of self-dis- 
cipline. 
Froebel urges the adaptation of all activities to child’s power, 
with full sympathy and codperation of the teacher. 
Many kindergartens, no doubt, give the children work be- 
yond their power to accomplish alone, but even were this not 
true, the child misses the closer contact and sympathy he has 
been accustomed to when he goes into the grade, with one 
teacher and three or four times as many children, and for a 
time they may seem dazed and dependent. I believe our 
oldest children should be left alone more than they are, and 
allowed to work out their own ideas oftener with simple 
materials; they should be encouraged to help the younger 
children and to feel that they are able to think and do for 
themselves. 
2. Assertion is made that kindergarten children are rest- 
less; this is not because of any fault, usually, except lack of 
fresh air and exercise. Their young bodies feel the narrow 
confines of the seats, and miss the skipping and games which 
they have become accustomed to. When will people cease to 
regard the natural need of an active, healthy, normal child, 
as badness and something to be quenched. God made the 
impulse to stir and turn and move and play; men have made 
the schoolroom as it is. God gave the children freedom and 
the out of doors; we give them nature books and shut them 
in the house to study them. God gives them air to breath; 
we cramp their chests by ill-fiting desks. Shall we make the 
children less active, or shall we make the school system more 
athletic? 
A third objection is that kindergartners use too great a 
variety of handwork and the children do not learn to do any- 
thing with proficiency, and that kindergarten children lack 
application. I am not going to attempt to defend this for I 
believe it is too largely true, and I think kindergartners are 
realizing more and more that we should do simpler things 
and use more repetition, thus giving the children opportunity 
to develop some skill in the use of a given material (clay or 
cutting, etc.), used two or three times in a week will enable the 
children to really grow in power, to use the material with 
definite purpose and originality, and the best kindergartners 
I know are those who work in this way.
-P-A-G-E-246
  246 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
However, we must remember that the kindergarten child 
is in a different stage of growth from that of the primary 
child. In the kindergarten, a child is being taught largely 
by means of sense impressions, and in the handling of the dif- 
ferent materials he is not so much getting definite results in 
the way of the work itself as he is gaining the delicate almost 
imperceptible impressions of weight, pressure, direction, num- 
ber, color, texture and form, which will make fruitful and 
vital his work of later years in whatever vocation he may use 
his power. 
Let us consider, then, part of the essential equipment which 
may be given in the two years’ of kindergarten training. 
The “rights of others” is a thing spoken of so often in our 
teachers meetings, that perhaps sometimes we grow too accus- 
tomed to the sound of the words, and fail to emphasize the 
action sufficiently. This is one of the first requirements to be 
observed in any successful social contact. From the first day 
our children should be helped to observe the principles of 
justice and courtesy toward others. 
A child cries when we are together on the circle; we do not 
forbid him to cry, but we say, “John, the children cannot 
hear the piano when you cry,” and he is diverted from himself 
to a regard for the rights of others, or persisting he must go 
away where he will disturb no one by his noise. The older 
children should be required to wait patiently while the little 
ones have time to think of a song, or to help, or play; they 
should not always be given something interesting to do, but 
should at times, have to sit quietly until others have finished 
their work. By these means they may be led to patience and 
self-control which will reward the primary teacher later on. 
The kindergarten should recognize in the child that natural 
wonder so different from idle curiosity, a feeling the nearest 
to reverence of which a child is capable, and which, properly 
encouraged, will keep him from flippancy and meddling, and 
from the cruelty of untaught children toward helpless animals 
and insects. 
The elements of courtesy should be taught, not merely 
stiff and unnatural forms of conduct, but frank and simple 
ways to express politeness and goodwill. 
The ability to meet the eye directly is, perhaps, the first
-P-A-G-E-247
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 247 
step toward this end, and, to me, one of the most important 
things we can give our little ones is a sincere test of a child’s 
inner life and stage of development, and to send a child out 
into public school life weak in this respect is to help him to 
actual concealment and lack of openness of character. 
In summing up the spiritual qualities which may be devel- 
oped and encouraged by careful kindergarten training. We 
would say that if a child has in the two years become con- 
scious of himself and of his relation to the lives of others, 
that there is a law of right and justice which must be obeyed, 
that he can have a part in making others comfortable and 
happy as they in turn help him. A feeling of joy in the 
beauty of the world and the things of nature, a real sense of 
all things being cared for through which comes a child’s first 
knowledge of God’s unfolding presence and love. If these 
things are his we know that the spiritual self is ready for the 
lessons which not only school, but life itself, will bring, and 
he has a foundation which, in many disillusionments and dis- 
appointments, will still keep sweet and serene. 
Let us see how the kindergarten equips the child mentally. 
We will suppose the child’s mother is one of many cares, 
perhaps ignorant and indifferent as well, and he has no 
definite teaching, or has never been encouraged to ask ques- 
tions. He comes into the kindergarten and is dazed with 
the many new impressions; a wise teacher will leave him 
much alone for a day, and longer, if necessary. The children 
will soon bring him into line for he watches them and feels 
that he is apart, and few people can stand isolation from 
their social equals; next morning, perhaps, he is eager to 
grasp his chair and follow as best he can to the circle. How 
clumsily he holds it, how waveringly he follows the line of 
confidently watching children; but there is a light in his eye, 
a purpose in his litle face which tells us the work has begun 
within him. He begins to feel a part of it all, and is at one 
with his environment, which is the first real essential in any 
growth process. 
Day by day he learns directions “round the table,” “lift 
your chair up,” “put your chair down ;” these have all a begin- 
ning toward definite movement and purpose, and he begins 
to know new words, his English vocabulary increases, the
-P-A-G-E-248

teacher finds his cap and jacket on the floor one day, although 
there are plenty of empty hooks; she leads him to them and 
says, “See the dust on the nice warm coat and cap mother 
bought for you, let us hang it up,” and she shows him a 
place which shall be his own. He does not know how to make 
the garments stay on the hook, but patiently she shows him 
until he can do it alone and he has learned it for all time, and 
with it a feeling of neatness and order begins to struggle to the 
light, and a proud consciousness of having a place of his own 
to keep things. These are little illustrations, but true to life, 
and day by day, countless mental facts are becoming clear to 
the awakening mind, impressions of color, sound, and rhythm 
stimulating sight, hearing, feeling and action are called forth 
in every period of work in the kindergarten, the games develop 
observation, alertness, imagination and memory; as he handles 
the gifts he learns proportion, number and form and his self- 
expression and imagery are aided. 
The story hour calls forth his imagination and memory; 
the songs and rhythmic exercises develop his sense of time, 
and he should be able to sing in a high but soft, clear voice, 
in a way which will leave his voice unstrained and he should 
be able to image what he sings about. I have put the physi- 
cal development last, for since it is so evident less may be 
said of it. However, all who work with children know that 
such development must be a means rather than the end, for 
a strong, healthy body is not all, it must be trained and 
coérdinated before it becomes the apt tool of the mind which 
controls it. 
The kindergarten games and rhythms do much for the child’s 
physical development, and really wonderful things may 
be accomplished with pigeon-toed, stoop-shouldered and those 
of slight physical defects of speech, or hearing by a teacher 
who understands “corrective suggestion,” and has the patience, 
and cares enough to try, not only feet and hands, eyes or ears, 
but the whole body is developed by the different activities of 
these games, rhythms and handwork. 
Let us work to give our children themselves, as their birth- 
right, in every way to make them self-active and self-expressive 
of the highest spiritual, mental and physical being. 
As the primary school has taken on more and more vitality
-P-A-G-E-249
  
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 249 
and resourcefulness in its methods, the barrier is lessening 
and the kindergarten children entering find an atmosphere of 
warmth and welcome and brightness akin to that they have 
left, except that it holds for them the larger possibility for 
independent doing and being, which they are ready and 
eager for. 
Let us believe that every stage of life is potential and that 
the present to each child is his all. Let us believe we are try- 
ing to give him what he is ready for and needs, for that time and 
place, and if we do it truly and with insight, he will be ready 
for what is beyond when he reaches it. It is a privilege to 
teach God’s little children, and we who come at this Christ- 
mas time, come together in the spirit of love for the child, the 
universal child of which the Christ child is the eternal symbol. 
The children have within them all possibility. We must not 
study how to put knowledge into them, but to foster and de- 
velop the germ of truth which is there. 
“Many dear things of His providence He hands to His little 
ones, by each other. How can He reach them else? And some- 
times whom can He use to reach them but just you and me?” 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE WORK OF THE SOUTHERN SOCIETY FOR PHI- 
LOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY. 
PROF, EDWARD FRANKLIN BUCHNER, 
Secretary Johns Hopkins University. 
Ir is a pleasure to respond to the invitation of this associa- 
tion to give a brief statement of the history and work of the 
Southern Society for Philosophy and psychology. The idea 
of forming such an organization was conceived in the mind of 
a member of the faculty of one of our Southern universities, 
who had a growing consciousness of his isolation from his col- 
leagues in these subjects. After a preliminary conference at 
Atlanta in February, 1904, the first regular meeting of the 
society was held in Baltimore December, 1904. The society 
endeavors to stimulate the scientific and philosophical work of 
its members by affording annual meetings for the presentation 
*15
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
and discussion of papers and reports. Since its organization 
the society has held its regular annual meetings, excepting one 
year. The membership has grown to about fifty, and comprises 
those men and women in our Southern institutions whose aca- 
demic training and interest in education enable them to be- 
come the leaders in the fields of interest represented by the 
society. 
The society in the first instance undertook to do a special 
work for the individual student of philosophy or psychology. 
Not many institutions in the South have more than one in- 
structor who is working along the lines represented by the or- 
ganization. The insulation under which these individuals are 
compelled to do their work is largely overcome by bringing 
them together from time to time in our annual meetings. By 
thus stimulating its members, they are encouraged to keep 
- abreast of the very rapid present-day developments in these 
two lines of intellectual activity. 
Again, the society has discovered that it can do a work 
serviceable to institutions as well as to individuals. College 
and university faculties can stand further information as to 
the part which the subjects of philosophy and psychology play 
in the real life of an educational institution or of the people at 
large. These two subjects have in recent years been under- 
going considerable reconstruction, and the society encourages 
its members to hold fast to the good that is in the old, while 
ever reaching out for the new. 
In the third place, in addition to aiding the individual and 
the institution, the society serves to fill a territorial need. We 
have the American Psychological Association, organized nine- 
teen years ago, and the American Philosophical Association, 
organized seven years ago. These two national associations 
generally meet at distant points in the East and North. They 
have never held a meeting in the Southern territory. The 
Southern Society has overcome this territorial limitation, and 
brings to the workers in these subjects in the Southern States 
opportunities which they cannot enjoy in the larger national 
associations. One of the interesting facts in our five years’ 
history is this: Since joining the organization, some of our 
members have been called as teachers to Northern and West- 
ern institutions. I consider one of the greatest tributes to
-P-A-G-E-251
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 251 
the efficiency of our work the fact that its members should thus 
be recognized. This also indicates that the character of our 
work has been along the lines of scientific progress rather than 
those of mere popular favor. 
Finally, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psy- 
chology has its contribution to make to the enlargening life 
in our Southern Staes. Philosophy has always been with man- 
kind, and will always remain with mankind, simply because 
man pursues high ideals and will not relinquish them. Modern 
man has come to the point where he must reconstruct his 
civilization and make it satisfy his needs, and, therefore, we 
are passing through the stage of testing every smallest detail 
in life by the strictest criteria known to reason. While phi- 
losophy is one of the oldest subjects in history, psychology is 
probably one of the youngest subjects. The society can aid in 
bringing all our institutions to a more conscious appreciation 
of the need for adequate instruction in these subjects. In this 
way the society can codperate with the Southern Educational 
Association and contribute its mite to the large work of this 
great organization. In this day of development which is run. 
ning so largely to the material, it is time that we should have 
organized efforts setting our face steadily against materialism 
and turning towards the principles of a larger spiritual life. 
For every spike driven in a new railroad, there should be some 
new ideas or ideals given to the country by a man prepared 
to do this thing. It is in this sense that the society stands op- 
posed to materialism and serves as a bulwark against the gross 
indifference to the larger character of humanity and its best 
interests.

PREFACE 
A MARKED characteristic of the new century in all pro- 
gressive nations is the quickened interest in the child and 
his education. Owing to this deepened interest in both the 
nature and the nurture of the child, professional educators 
are beginning to look more earnestly to history, sociology, 
psychology, and ethics for guidance and help in their work. 
This book treats certain aspects of social education in pri- 
mary grades with the greatest possible simplicity. Especial 
emphasis is placed upon ways and means of enlarging the 
child’s experience so as to favor the development of the his- 
toric sense. The various solutions of the problems of procur- 
ing shelter, food, clothing; of bearing burdens, of traveling ; 
of exchanging goods and of celebrating holidays, make an 
excellent background for later work in history. Because 
each of the various countries selected by the author for in- 
struction in primary grades solves these problems in its own 
characteristic way the contrasts are conspicuous, and serve 
as a stimulus to both observation and further curiosity con- 
cerning human institutions and discoveries. 
Because each school is a center of community life, each 
pupil can be trained into responsible membership in that 
community. He can be saturated with the spirit of service 
and provided with the instruments of effective self-direction 
suited to his stage of development. The problems there 
solved reflect the life of the larger society of which the 
school isa part. In this way the surest guarantee of a worthy

democratic society in the future is secured. The pupil is 
trained daily in adapting means to ends. He is acquiring 
neatness and skill in handling materials, tools, and utensils. 
He is forming habits of order and industry. Upon the solu- 
tion of such problems and processes society depends. 
The demand of primary teachers for aids and suggestions 
to help them to make more effective use of the “ Report of 
the Committee of Eight”! is met by this book. This re- 
port states that “A leading aim in history teaching is to 
help the child to appreciate what his fellows are doing and 
to help him to intelligent voluntary action in agreement or 
disagreement with them.” To carry out these aims the 
report advises continuous attention in each of the grades 
to events in the past which the pupil can understand and 
also to contemporary problems suited to his intelligence. 
The various fields of human activity must be drawn upon 
for these events — political, industrial, social, educational, 
religious, and no one of them should exclude the others. 
See introduction to the report, page x. 
The inexperienced primary teacher who is not a specialist 
in history asks: How can I determine which events of the 
past are suited to my pupils? How am I to know which 
contemporary. problems are within the range of their intel- 
ligence? What are the natural processes of a child’s mental 
life? How does his mind work upon the material presented 
to it? What are the outward signs of these mental pro- 
cesses, and how may we recognize them in our daily expe- 
rience with children? What criteria will help me to decide 
how to adapt historic material to the needs of primary 
children ?

Answers to these and many other practical questions are 
given with concrete illustrations in this book, which is not 
written for the initiated few, but for the interested many, 
who are alert and eager for concrete suggestions and prac- 
tical guidance. Technical language is avoided wherever it 
seems possible to do so. 
In Part I, a careful analysis is made of the child’s expe- 
rience. ‘The function of the imagination in the learning 
process is described and illustrated. The instincts and 
interests of children are discussed and tabulated. All dis- 
cussions are based upon the most recent thought with 
which our ablest psychologists and specialists in child study 
supply us. 
Practical suggestions for the use of the sand table, pic- 
tures, and constructiou. work, as well as the type lessons, are 
given to show how the theory is carried out in practice. 
By a careful study of Part II the teacher sees how time may 
be saved by unifying the various kinds of work done in 
primary grades. All the material selected and all the sug- 
gestions for directing the child’s activities so as to lessen 
: haphazard work and secure more systematized and better 
organized results have been tested repeatedly in daily work 
in primary grades. 
The book is an outgrowth of personal experience in every 
grade of school work in both rural and city schools, together 
with much observation of able teachers and practice teachers. 
No teacher is a perfect teacher, but all teachers can profit by 
the best examples which come down to us from the greatest 
teachers in all ages. The utmost we can do for each other 
is to give the results of personal experience. 
I am deeply indebted to my students in the East and in 
the West, whose inspiration has made the work possible.

Chapter I 
INTRODUCTION 
A CHILD can see in any person, object, social group, or 
situation only what his personal experience brings the 
power of seeing. When he enters the first year of the 
primary department, he is living in a very small social 
world. His interests are centered largely in |, . : ‘ Limitations 
the present and in the hero in the concrete. o¢ primary 
For instance, he admires the carpenter who Child’s 
saws and hammers, the man who manages a Sense Ex- 
boat, the motorman who controls a trolley car, Pee 
the policeman, and the expressman who brings packages, 
because his sense experience has embraced the activities 
in which they are engaged. Father is his greatest hero. 
The home, the street, and the school constitute his 
universe. . 
It is impossible for the child to picture society of other 
countries and other times until he has first learned to 
observe the simple, conspicuous elements in . . S ei a % To Social-

has some conception of organized society as First Step * a in History 
it exists to-day. Consequently, the first step menehings 
toward laying a foundation for the future study 
of history and of other social subjects is to deepen the 
child’s appreciation of the human relations with which he 
is already familiar, in other words, to socialize him.

2 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
The teacher of primary grades knows that in all civi- 
lized communities we have division of labor, coéperation 
in various forms, and regularly organized society so that 
our lives may become richer and better than they could 
possibly be if each individual attempted to live in isola- 
tion, or tried to supply all of his own needs. She has 
arrived at this understanding of modern society in many 
different ways: through personal observation; through 
the rendering of services to the community ; through con- 
versation with others; and through the study of history 
and the social sciences. The primary pupil, however, 
has no such point of vantage from which to view the life 
around him. No child of this age can grasp the far- 
reaching benefits of organized society, but he can be led 
to appreciate the value of a policeman in the concrete 
instance where he helps the lost playmate to find his way 
home, or to realize the service rendered by the splendid 
fireman who saves a burning house. He can understand 
that there must be some one to turn the rope as well as 
some one to jump over it, and that a child who wants 
to choose every game and to take the best part in each 
deserves to have no playmates. 
It is partly by observation, partly by actual service in 
the family, on the street, in school, and in the community 
that the child learns why individuals ‘‘work together” 
ae to accomplish certain results. He can be led Beginning 
with to see how the home helps the school ; how the 
Child’s school helps the home; how both help the 
Immediate neighborhood and the town or city. The first 
oe three years of school life offer many opportuni- 
{ ties for pupils to render in the home, in the 
school, and in the community, actual service appropriate
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION 3 
to their stage of development. The faithful perform- 
anice of such service helps to develop in each child a sense 
of individual responsibility and leads him to take the first 
steps in appreciating the sacrifices that have been made 
and the price that has been paid for the blessings and 
privileges that others have passed on to him. 
This process of socializing the child not only gives the 
background necessary for the intelligent study of history, 
but at the same time trains for good citizenship, since 
codperation, or union of effort for the common good, is 
the very essence of good government from the democratic 
point of view. 
Beginning with the immediate environment of the 
home, the school, and the town or city, the work of the 
first three grades should gradually widen 2 : S The the horizon of the primary child’s conscious Graquat 
life. He should be given an idea of men of Widening 
primitive times, how they lived and what we °f Child’s 
owe to their hardihood and perseverance. His ~°”°™ 
interest should be awakened in boys and girls who live 
in places very different from his own country, who dress 
differently and play. differently. Stories of great men 
of other times, especially of men connected with the 
history of our own country and whose deeds many of our 
holidays commemorate, are a form of history especially 
adapted to the primary grades. 
This book outlines in Part II subject matter adapted 
to the first three years of school life. In the Seemneey, 
first year emphasis is placed on what the child of Subject 
can actually see, touch, hear, make, or do. Matter of

and industrial relations in which he lives. His home

life is contrasted with the home life of the Indian and 
the Eskimo to deepen his appreciation of his present 
surroundings. 
The subject matter of the second year enables the child 
to see how people lived when there were no farms, no 
stores, no homes, no tools. He is then gradually led to 
see how the elementary phases of material progress be- 
came possible. He learns what the first tools of primi- 
tive man were like; what are the advantages of fire ; how 
animals were domesticated, and how crude were primitive 
methods of transportation and burden bearing. 
In the third year, the child is introduced to some of the 
world’s great leaders of long ago —to Joseph, Ulysses, 
Alexander the Great, and Columbus, for instance. These 
are recommended by the Report of the Committee of 
Eight as suitable material for the third grade. In ad- 
dition child life in other lands is presented to stimulate 
the child’s sympathy with the nations from which Ameri- 
cans have come. 
Tn all three grades suggestions are given for celebrating 
national holidays so as to make such celebrations a natural 
outgrowth of the daily work. The type lessons, practical 
suggestions, the problems set and questions asked, should 
prove stimulating to a teacher. The book illustrates 
how instruction in elementary civics may be combined 
with language, drawing, geography, nature work, the 
celebration of holidays, and the appreciation of some of 
the world’s heroes of history. The child’s independent 
seat work is a natural outgrowth of the wholesome interests 
to which the daily work makes a strong appeal, and thus 
it reénforces the regular work.

Chapter II 
THE TEACHER AND THE CHILD 
Onty those who know how to play with little children 
should attempt to teach in primary grades. Therein lies 
the supreme test of one’s ability to understand ee 
them. Can you remember how as a child you yity a 
played out in the woods, or down on the beach, dren a 
or up in the attic, or out in a vacant lot, or up in Necessity 
the hayloft? Have you in your maturer years meaes 
experienced genuine pleasure in observing other : 
children playing ina similar: manner? Have you sufficient 
comradeship with children to get yourself invited into their 
inner circle away from the older members of the family? 
Can you sit with them as a welcome observer, giving sug- 
gestions and criticism only when the children themselves 
ask for them? Have you that sincere respect for the 
child’s individuality and for his genuine - intelligence 
which prevents you from using condescending “baby 
talk” when you address a child, and which restrains you 
from showing an assumed liveliness of manner in dealing 
with children? Can you listen to a child’s griefs, when 
others think them of no consequence, with the serious 
attention and sincerity which is his proper due? Is it 
easy for you to show consideration for children in ways 
that they do not resent? Are you careful not to censure 
the child publicly for spontaneous utterances, even if 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
they happen to be contrary to the conventions of adult 
society? Do you expect from a child an unnatural degree 
of self-mastery, and praise him in public or expose his 
failings? 
The primary teacher who can answer the first four 
questions in the affirmative knows far better than any 
verbal description can portray how free, unre-

game which is devised or promoted by mature persons. 
A child plays most enjoyably, most effectively, with a 
few children of his own age. At such times he has the 
opportunity to think out something of his own. The 
teacher should refrain from supervising games or direct- 
ing dramatic personation unless the children seek. and 
request help. Then the help should come only by way of 
suggesting possibilities. The invention should be the 
children’s very own if it is to be of most service to them 
and prove a real source of joy. 
Play of this free type reveals the traits of character 
and the dispositions of the children. Here, if anywhere, 
the primary teacher can observe each child’s 
he treatment of his playmates, his inclinations, his 
Character ambitions, his inventiveness, his merits in 
to the various directions, and his failings. All may be

Not every one can attain to this degree of. maturity. 
Some people are by nature and training unfitted to inter- 
pret the actions of little children. One such 7, 
type of person shows her deficiency in the lack of Unsym- 
insight necessary to discover the real causes for pathetic 
a child’s actions or behavior. She is unable to O>server- 
discern the various combinations of the child’s different 
characteristics. She may be, and often is, a very con- 
scientious person with a zealous fidelity to duty and the 
best of principles. She wishes children well. She wants 
to do her ‘‘whole duty’? by them, no doubt, but she is so 
utterly blind where child nature is to be judged that she 
blunders constantly in one direction or another. 
For instance, she may see a child observing his re- 
flection in a mirror. It interests him. He is simply 
trying to get a clear-cut impression of his own (;) The 
identity. But the dutiful adult says he is vain. Dutiful

rect one, too, based on the evidence of his own senses 
without any thought of its relation to others, — dis- 
paragement does not enter into his thought process at 
all, —and she pronounces him rude. He has difficulty 
in distinguishing between the subjective and objective 
worlds of his experience, and he makes statements which 
to her adult way of looking at things are untrue, so she 
charges the child with falsehood. His sense of private 
ownership in property is undeveloped. If he appro- 
priates what is accessible, she charges him with theft, 
and is unnecessarily alarmed about his future. Just 
imagine the effect of all this upon a finely sensitive child, 
easily wounded! Such a child feels the slightest mis- 
trust, the smallest unkindness, the least act of injustice,
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
and any contemptuous ridicule leaves upon him a lasting 
impression. 
There is still another type of woman who fails to get 
near the child — the person who approaches little chil-

Pompous eye, and with a ‘“‘world-sufficient-unto-itself”’ 
Adult. air. She inspires either hatred or fear, — the 
two emotions which are responsible for most of the 
misery in the world. Such a person lacks the imagination 
to see how her conduct affects little children, because 
she lacks greatness of soul. It would be utterly impos- 
sible for her to understand either the joys or the sorrows 
of the child’s heart. Not unless she were born again, 
and the gods were kind to her, could she become sympa- 
thetic with children or fit to lead them. 
The primary teacher must know how to interpret chil- 
dren’s play, their serious moods, their dreams and as- 
pirations, their faults and their dangers. She must know 
how to give indirect suggestion and put the child at ease. 
Then she can put new courage into his heart by her strong, 
kind words, or shed light on his perplexities by her wise 
ones. 
A teacher will easily become a favorite with children 
if she can tell with epic smoothness stories which have

-P-A-G-E-21
  
THE TEACHER AND THE CHILD 9 
roundabout way that he comes to understand emotions 
and sentiments. The child combines in himself ideal- 
ism and realism, and that is the combination found in 
epic national poetry. This is why such poetry appeals 
to him so strongly. He will probably want to hear the 
same story innumerable times, because he has an uncon- 
scious need of assimilating thoroughly that which harmo- 
nizes with his stage of development. His imagination is 
incessantly creating and reconstructing ; consequently he 
needs full, entire, and deep impressions as material for 
such mental activity. 
The primary teacher must remember that not all humor 
appeals to children. A simple anecdote presenting a 
humorous situation doubles them up with laugh- ae 
ter. But they have no relish for the ironic type yymor 
of humor. Comic psychological stories about that Ap-

necessary maturity or experience of life to enable 
him to appreciate them. The tale that will leave an 
impression is the tale full of life, with action or surprises, 
simple in style without any noticeable moral. 
When one can tell such stories exceedingly well, one 
will have bridged the gap between the adult and the 
child and have become worthy of his esteem and seine es 
friendship. The teacher’s labor will be richly 4 pink 
rewarded by additional joy in living, as well as between 
by greatly increased power in enabling little aoe and 
children to understand themselves and to inter- j 
pret the world about them. She will have the satisfac- 
tion of learning that the mental food which is most 
attractive to a child is also for him the most nourishing. 
She is then well on her way to a just comprehension of   
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
the conditions surrounding child life and of the funda- 
mental principles upon which all good teaching must be 
based. 
Such intimate understanding of children as has just 
been described will give the teacher a first-hand knowledge 
that will be of paramount importance in all future work 
related either directly or indirectly to child development. 
No treatise on child study can be understood except in 
terms of one’s experience with children. This experience 
will vitalize what is read, increase one’s sensitiveness to 
the child’s expressive acts, and serve as an index to the 
child’s real nature and needs. It will enable one to learn 
much from every child with whom it is her privilege to 
live, and consequently she will be of greater service to 
children in general. 
The next step in widening one’s experience of children 
is to look at them through the eyes of a person who is 
ans gifted in interpreting their actions. This will 
asInter- give the primary teacher an opportunity to com- 
preters of pare her own insight with that of another, and 
ee will suggest new ways of interpreting child 
: nature. The possible number of children of 
different types that one may know will be greatly in- 
creased by this means. Every lover of children may 
have her sympathies aroused by means of a good story 
about children. 
A clever story of this type written in the last twenty- 
five years is ‘‘Emmy Lou; her Book and Heart,” by 
George Madden Martin (McClure, Phillips & Co., New 
York, 1902; copyright now owned by Doubleday, Page 
and Co.). ‘‘Emmy Lou” is a book of unusual charm, 
and from a pedagogical point of view deserves a place in
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE TEACHER AND THE CHILD 11 
the private library of every teacher. It deals with 
school life from the entering class to the close of 
the high-school course. The book shows how many op- 
portunities the school offers for indirect instruction in 
social virtues and brings into clear view a child who is 
exceedingly miserable because she is not understood either 
at home or in school. She is easily mystified and per- 
plexed and adapts herself to new situations with great 
difficulty. 
From the description of Emmy Lou’s confusion in 
regard to the meaning of words and her distress in various 
trying social situations in which she is placed, the teacher 
can infer the difficulty that a pupil has in studying history 
in the higher grades when the foundation has not been 
well laid. She will also realize the child’s sore need of 
sympathetic guidance by a person who knows the end 
from the beginning. The book will help primary teachers 
to appreciate why the primary grades must prepare for 
both the vocabulary and the ideas that are to be used 
later in their study of history. It shows that genuine 
personal desire, when keen, will induce even an Emmy 
Lou to put forth strenuous efforts. The concrete elucida- 
tion makes the reader feel the necessity of searching 
diligently for the child’s needs, and the value of setting 
definite concrete problems to be worked out on the sand 
table, or through some other form of construction work. 
Not until the teacher finds a motive for work that makes 
a strong appeal to the child can she hope to secure that 
active, interested, concentrated attention which will 
stimulate children to persevere to the end of the task for 
the sake of the purpose which seems so desirable to them.

Chapter III 
THE CHILD’S EXPERIENCE 
  Mopern psychologists tell us that what will interest 
a child at any stage in his career will depend upon the 
past history of that particular child and the 
nee nature of his experience. To ascertain how to Child’s eee ; Experi- lay a foundation in the primary grades for the

a that primary children have had, for good peda- 
gogy demands that all instruction begin on their 
plane of experience. The child’s experiences are concrete, 
not abstract; simple, not complex; immediate, not re- 
mote. Consequently, history conceived as a record of 
impersonal events with their remote causes and effects 
lies wholly outside the child’s plane of experience.

time ago,” in his stories, and some day he will ask, ‘‘ How 
long is ‘a long time ago’?’”’ When he does, it will be an 
indication that he has begun to take an interest in “time.” 
That interest must be fed and encouraged, but it cannot 
be hurried. The time sense develops very slowly and 
needs objective assistance. When the child has a per- 
sonal interest in time, the teacher can help him to expand 
and enrich it. Until a child has a sense of the process of 
time, or of conscious intervals of time behind him, he can 
have no definite historic consciousness. 
_ Historic conceptions rest upon the following: (1) the 
sense of cause and effect ; (2) the sense of the social unit ; 
(3) the sense of time; and (4) the sense of the 
value of a true record. When these concepts Elements 
first appear in the child’s consciousness, they ee

gether. Any one of them may lead for a time, 
and then another, but no one develops very much more 
rapidly than the others. The child’s interest in a true 
record and in historical time is seldom strong before ten 
years of age, unless these elements of the historic sense 
have been stimulated and guided by careful instruction. 
Historical dates are understood by few children under 
thirteen. One day during the morning exercises, a child 
in the third grade who volunteered to tell his class some- 
thing about George Washington made this remarkable 
statement: ‘‘George Washington was the first man 
that ever lived.” He was then asked by his teacher to 
tell what made him think so. His reply was, “‘ Because 
he was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts 
of his countrymen.” The reply shows that he was 
deficient in more than one element of the historic sense. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  
14 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
His classmate who added, ‘‘That can’t be true because 
we have a book at home that says George Washington 
married a widow, so there must have been a man ahead 
of him,” had a better developed historic sense. The 
second boy had gained the power to infer, a capacity which 
can be hastened by judicious training. However, the 
expression ‘‘a book at home”’ is not quite definite enough 
to indicate that even he appreciates the real nature of a 
true record. It is quite possible that the first boy neither 
knew nor cared who said “‘ Washington was first in war, 
first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.” 
He probably did not know when it was said, under what 
circumstances it was said, where it was said, or whether 
it was true ornot. The second boy can make some legit- 
imate inferences, but a statement in print in a book is 
probably a true statement to him. He has not yet realized 
that books, as well as boys, can make inaccurate state- 
ments. 
The experience of a child of six is farther from that of 
a child of ten or twelve than the latter’s experience is 
.,. from that of a youth of twenty-one. When the A Child’s : : : Under- adult student of history endeavors to gain an im-

legislative body, he finds the procedure there filled with 
meaning because of the nature of his experience. Let 
us suppose that a primary child accompanies him. How 
would the phenomena before his eyes impress him?
-P-A-G-E-27
THE CHILD'S EXPERIENCE 15 
Would he not be blind to both the facts and the factors 
that enlist the closest attention of the adult? The child 
and the adult may be looking at the very same phenomena, 
but they view them from different planes. Their re- 
sponses differ. The whole idea of representation in 
government, of passing a bill, of making a motion, and 
especially of controlling different sections of the country, 
is something entirely outside of the primary child’s life 
plane. 
If we were to analyze the nature of his difficulty, we 
should find that it is not merely a matter of the meaning 
of words, although most of them would be without 
significance to him. It is a question of complex, unseen, 
and unsuspected relations. It is a question of motives 
affecting a large social organism of which the child has 
little apprehension. It is a question of generalizations 
for the construction of which there are basal particulars 
still unknown to the child. 
It is quite evident, then, that the child’s attitude toward 
history differs materially from that of the adult. The 
child in the primary grades is living in a little 
world of his own which as yet is quite lacking in His Under- 
perspective and in proportion. His critical sense standing of

tempt to force upon him the abstract, the complex, or 
the circuitous will result in failure. He is not ready for

  knowledge in this form. Some children enter the primary 
grades without knowing the right hand from the left. 
They have no conception of north or south, east or west, 
valley or mountain. Some do not know whether or not 
a book in their hands is right side up. They may have 
fairly good control of arms and legs, and at the same 
time be so ‘‘pudding-fisted”’ that they handle a pencil 
as if it were an unwieldy club. Surely maps are out of 
, the question for them, but personally conducted tours 
are in place. From well-conducted excursions they get 
sense impressions and imagery to be used later in repre- 
sentative work. 
The primary teacher’s first aim, then, will be to make 
sure that the pupils under her guidance have every op- 
Howe portunity to get vivid sense impressions as a 
Child Ob- basis for comparisons and inferences. The pri- 
tains the mary child’s plane of life is one of activity, not 
eo ty reflection. He is more interested in apprecia- 
for tions of the external and the objective than in 
History the subjective. He is not given to introspec- 
rua: tion. What he really gets out of any subject is 
the images formed by himself, and all imagery is made 
out of the raw material furnished by sense perception. 
Success in history study is dependent upon rich, concrete 
imagery. Gesture, pantomime, and dramatization help 
to secure imagery and to stimulate expression. Con- 
struction work suited to the child’s stage of development 
is of great value in helping the child to gain clear-cut, 
definite images. Pictures, stories, and anecdotes are of 
value. Perception and expression are closely related 
in the process of learning history. When a child enters 
the primary school he becomes a member of a ‘‘social

group.”’ This new experience of social life with children 
of his own age and stage of development furnishes an 
excellent basis for gaining ideas of ‘‘the social unit” 
which is one of the elements of the historic sense. 
We may conclude then: 
1. That a child can interpret only such knowledge as 
touches closely his own experience, and that his 
interests are largely in the immediate present. 
2. That the material which feeds the child’s present 
desires and illuminates and interprets present environ- 
ment for him is legitimate history to present to the child 
in the primary grades. 
3. That the child is always in direct contact with 
present social life at home and in school, and he can be- 
come socially efficient in it only through the exercise of 
certain appropriate social activities. 
4. That dramatic expression should be encouraged in all 
grades of primary work in every possible way. History 
lends itself easily to such treatment, and the value of 
it can scarcely be overestimated. It develops the sym- 
pathetic imagination and.lays a foundation for toler- 
ance, compassion, charity, and a genuine appreciation 
of humanity. It stimulates a desire to emulate the heroic 
and the noble in human conduct. 
5. That we should in primary work avoid depending 
upon interests rooted in time and space until concepts 
of time and place have been developed by school instruc- 
tion. Summary.

  THE CHILD’S NORMAL INSTINCTS AND INTERESTS 
Tue teacher in the primary grades must take advan-~ 
tage of the child’s desire for intercourse with others, or 
rae his communicative instinct. He wants to talk to 
Child's Parents and grandparents, to uncles and aunts, 
Commu- to brothers and sisters and playmates, to his 
er nurse and to his teacher. He wants to tell them 
* what he has done, what he has seen, what he has 
felt and thought ; and he wants them to tell him not only 
their own experiences, but also what other persons have 
done, in other times and in other countries. He desires 
intercourse with other lives. If this communicative 
instinct is to make healthy growth, the balance between 
the two desires, to talk and to listen, must be well main- 
tained. The teacher should give the child plenty of 
wholesome things to talk about and should systemati- 
cally encourage free conversation. 
The teacher should also take advantage of the child’s 
desire to identify his life with the lives of other people, 
or other living things. In his play he is fre- 
quently pretending to be some grown-up person 
of his acquaintance, some hero of history, some 
traveler, some adventurer, some giant, dwarf, or fairy, or 
some animal, wild or tame. He enjoys having playmates, 
but, if they are not present, then’ a doll or a toy animal

must for the time being become endowed with life and 
assume the part of playmate, and thus become his fellow 
actor. This is a manifestation of the dramatic instinct. 
As the child indulges these natural instincts, he goes out 
of himself by means of sympathy and imagination and 
participates in the lives of others. When the primary 
teacher of history tells the children about people of other 
times and in other lands, she must give them abundant 
opportunity for acting owt what they are learning. No 
matter how crude the histrionic efforts may be at first, 
the children will gain from them a vital interest in the 
subject dramatized. 
The teacher’s clue as to the pupil’s attitude toward 
any material presented for his instruction, is the nature 
of that pupil’s response. She must endeavor to 
learn from the character of his response what the if ae 
pupil’s individual activities mean to himself in opbserv- 
terms of his own mental endowment, so that she ing the 
may give him intelligent and sympathetic guid- Child’s 
ance in enriching his experience and in causing oe 
it to become more adequate to the situations 
of reallife: She must strive to discover both the sentiment 
and the intellect of the child in his own expressive acts, so 
as to secure a vantage ground for successful teaching. 
Even a teacher who is quite inexperienced in observing 
young children can readily see that normal children like 
to talk and listen; to act out or make believe; to draw, 
paint, and model; to dance and sing; to know the why 
and the how of things; to construct things. The primary 
teacher’s success depends in a large measure upon the 
way she fosters and encourages the growth of desirable 
instincts and interests.
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
Such instincts manifest themselves in various ways, 
but chiefly in what is commonly called “children’s play.” 
The Need lVvery experienced teacher knows that a child’s 
of Self play is for him a very serious occupation. Conse- 
expres- quently, the wise primary teacher models the 
Saas work of the school as much as possible on the 
lines which children spontaneously follow when at play. 
If a child is to grow, it must be by his own efforts. No 
one can exercise his limbs except himself. Unless he 
does it himself, it can never be done. In a similar way 
his own exertions develop his mental and spiritual powers. 
Consequently, the habit of doing things for himself by 
himself, of expressing himself, must be built up. The 
child needs to become accustomed to sincere, fearless 
self-expression. 
When a child’s natural instincts are suppressed, his 
wholesome development is retarded. The country child 
is, as arule, permitted to yell, to pound, to ham- 
pas mer, to run, to jump, and to dance, because he Country i 1 . S ¥ 
Childs may do all these things without interfering with 
Oppor- the comfort or convenience of neighbors. He 
eae for can easily come into close quarters’ with field 
Bere s and stream and forest. He can play on the 
grass and pick flowers and berries and nuts. His 
playgrounds are as large and as varied as he chooses to 
make them. If he is brought up in humble surroundings, 
he is trained in assuming responsibilities and in obeying 
promptly. He will probably really enjoy work of a 
practical nature before he enters school. 
The city child brought up in a crowded tenement or 
poorly constructed flat has no such opportunities. His 
playground may be on top of mother’s bed or under it, or
-P-A-G-E-33
THE CHILD’S NORMAL INSTINCTS AND INTERESTS 21 
in the back alley where the garbage is placed. He 
seldom knows what would happen were he to scream 
with all his might*because the rights of neighbors must 
be considered. The delights of pounding, of xe 
hammering, or jumping or running, or even city 
dancing are seldom sufficiently familiar to per- Child’s 
mit normal development. His natural instincts Limita- . . tions. 
are suppressed daily, and consequently his 
wholesome growth is retarded. If he has one room in 
which he may play, or even a sand pile, he is fortunate. 
His opportunities for genuine childish fun and frolic are 
too limited to permit his full, free development. In 
such cases the school should supplement the home and 
give the child, so far as possible, what his interests crave. 
The children of the well-to-do, professional classes 
usually hear good language in their homes and see models 
of good art on the floors and walls of their own 5 : ee The 
residences. Such a child has the privilege of cpa of 
listening to good stories and good music. He the Pro- 
gives parties and attends parties. He spends a fessional 
portion of the summer at the seashore or the cipreSe: 
mountains with intelligent adults who delight in directing 
his observations, so as to help him to get some idea of 
place relations. He has many opportunities to learn 
how to be polite and courteous in manner. His interests 
ought to be wider and his vocabulary larger than those 
of the other children described above. In what direction 
will his shortcomings lie? Has his development been 
retarded in any way? Does he want to find out things 
for himself? Is he inventive? Is he persevering? 
How about his sense of responsibility? Is he selfish? 
Is he domineering? Will he obey instantly? Or will

he come after a while? What can he make, cut out, or 
saw, or act out? Can he use hammers with ease? Of 
course good food has been provided for him, but has he 
assimilated nourishment from it? Or is he anemic? 
What kind of muscles has he? 
Some such inventory as the above each teacher must 
make for herself and govern her procedure by what she 
learns, because physical_endurance, muscular strength, 
nervous control, general intelligence, imagination, and 
receptivity, all help to determine what should be done 
next and what should be avoided. Unless a child can 
be induced to choose a task and concentrate his attention 
upon it and keep at it until it is completed, there is little 
chance for healthy growth. 
It is natural for an individual to be dominated at dif- 
ferent times by quite different impulses and ideas, but

Interests are mental states closely identified with per-

healthy mind may result from too much seclusion. They 
may be due to allowing one idea or passion torule. Varied 
interests and a social environment accelerate wholesome 
growth. Find out what the child’s needs are, in what 
direction real growth needs to be made, and stimulate 
him to choose problems that willlead to that end.

The following tabulation of children’s interests is 
based on King’s interpretation of ‘Studies of Children’s 
Interests”” made by careful observers. It is given here 
in the hope that it may serve to impress upon the mind 
of the primary teacher that the activities of each stage 
of childhood make possible the activities of later stages, 
and really condition the adequate performance of the 
functions of maturity. The tabulation sets before us a 
general view of the possible natural resources of children 
between the ages of two and half and twelve years. It 
may help the primary teacher to secure a standard by 
which to determine the possible needs of children. This 
experience of fellow teachers and of competent observers 
of children can only point out what to expect, or what 
may be there. Nothing less than the history of each 
child and the nature of his experience can determine 
what actually interests him here and now. Consequently, 
the teacher must explore the contents of the minds of 
the children who compose her class before she can deter- 
mine what does really interest them and in that way 
secure a point of contact with their minds.

24 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
A TABULATION OF THE INTERESTS OF CHILDREN 
I. First Period of Childhood (from two and one half years to six or 
seven years). 
A. Distinctively a play period. 
1. Child at first does not differentiate self from activity and 
the object or objects that occasion the experience. This 
is impulsive expenditure of energy. 
a. Mere activity is of absorbing interest. 
b. Activities are more real than the objects which sug- 
gested them. 
2. Possibility of play as distinct from mere impulsive activity 
due to growth of an image abstracted from the activity. 
a. Questioning age begins. 
b. Child has strong interest in the real experiences of world 
immediately about him. 
c. He is interested in the myth, because it helps him to 
interpret the situations in which he is placed. 
d. He is interested in mimic plays and reproductions of 
simple social activities. 
B. Tendency to run away. 
1. Tendency from the age of two to four seems to be aimless, 
no consciousness of danger. The activity is almost 
reflex. 
2. Tendency from the age of four to seven seems to be due 
to a feeling of restlessness and a craving to rove and to 
escape the unpleasant. 
C. Characteristics of games played between ages of three and six. 
1. They are rarely spontaneous. 
2. They tend to be individual but not competitive. 
3. At about six years of age, amusements begin to center 
about objects serving as means to arouse impulsive

action — the objects used symbolically. Imitative games 
appeal strongly to the child of six, and more strongly 
to girls than to boys. 
4. Between the ages of six and eight the interest in guessing 
games and riddles is strongest. 
D. Collecting instinct weak. 
1. Articles collected are easy of access — spools, broken 
china, etc. 
2. There is no definite purpose — crude, groping, scrappy. 
E. Degree of control. 
1. Child of four or five is master of certain motor reactions 
and sense adjustments. 
2. As a rule, he is fairly well adjusted to the requirements 
of his own social group. 
3. He is master only of the larger bodily movements, — 
finer adjustments not yet acquired. 
4. Power of attention is uncertain. The imagery is flitting. 
Attention within the limits of a given image constant 
. but interrupted by constant change of images. 
5. He has little grasp of an activity as a whole or as related 
to its setting. To a child at this stage one detail or 
salient feature is emphasized. 
Illustration : 
To shoe horses is blacksmithing. 
To wash dishes is housekeeping. 
6. At the age of six or seven he reaches a transition stage. 
He comes into a broader and more confusing environ- 
ment. 
II. Second Period of Childhood (from six or seven years to ten 
years). 
A. A period of bewilderment and lack of adjustment. 
1. Child’s energy may be largely consumed in effecting finer 
motor adjustments. 
a. Child’s interest in details begins. 
b. The element of skill is now seen to have importance. 
c. The element of success has value for him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
2. Keynote of the period seems to be an effort to get control 
or mastery not of self but of his objective environment. 
a. Interest in stirring biographies. 
b. Interest in stirring events. 
c. Desire to be a soldier to fight for country. 
. Tendency to run away during this period due to: 
1. His impatience under restraint. 
2. The fact that his home life seems to him to be unresponsive 
to his needs. 
. Games of this period. 
1. They are still exclusively individual, but the element of 
competition enters. 
2. Significant features of the games of this period are: 
a. Motor coédrdinations. 
b. Exercise in sense judgments. 
Imitative games still have interest for boys up to the 
3. age of ten. 
Imitative games still have interest for girls up to the 
age of eleven. 
4. Group games have only limited interest until the age of ten. 
Interest in running games is high with boys. 
5. {Interest in running games with girls is only slight at 
any time, and declines rapidly after eight.   . Collecting instinct much as in previous period. 
1. No definite attempt at classification. 
2. No great sacrifice made to procure specimens. 
. Degree of control. 
1. Coérdinations are not definitely worked out as seen in: 
a. Child’s reluctance to undertake what will not be plainly 
successful. 
b. Great increase in error in mental work at the age of eight. 
c. Child’s distrust of self and diffidence. 
2. Child’s horizon has widened. 
a. Boys are interested in more games than formerly and 
less eager to follow the father’s occupation. 
b. Most girls wish to be teachers or dressmakers.  
-P-A-G-E-39
    
THE CHILD’S NORMAL INSTINCTS AND INTERESTS 27 
III. Third Period of Childhood (from ten years to twelve years). 
A. The formation of clubs and secret societies a preéminent 
characteristic of this period.

3. Tendency in girls to become gregarious and form themselves 
into cliques or sets. 
4. Definite appearance of altruistic feeling. 
B. Characteristics of the games of this period. 
1. The favorite games of this period afford the most vigorous 
activity for the whole body and give scope and depth 
to previous coérdinations. 
2. The group game is prominent now. 
3. The boy glories in the success of the team or of the club 
rather than in his individual prowess. 
C. Collecting instinct far greater than in either of the preceding 
periods. 
1. Stores are increased by discovery and trading. 
2. Efforts to classify on basis of color and size are made; 
no attempt at scientific classification. 
D. Degree of control. 
1. Rapid decrease of error in mental tests at twelve shows a 
notable gain in virility of mind over the child at eight. 
2. The coérdinations on the intellectual side at twelve and 
thirteen correspond to those on the physical side at 
or before ten. 
3. The intellectual interest in puzzles culminates at twelve. 
a. Mechanical puzzles are the favorites at eleven. 
6. Geometrical puzzles are the favorites at twelve and 
thirteen. 
c. Arithmetical and language puzzles come later. 
4. Marked susceptibility to influence of others appears. 
a. Child’s susceptibility to evil influences is greatest at 
twelve. 
6. Child mistrusts his own powers because the social 
situation seems too complex for him to control.

FUNCTION OF IMAGINATION 
  A KNOWLEDGE of the elements of psychology is neces- 
sary to enable a teacher to select suitable history material 
ad for children’s study or to choose wisely the mode 
tance of Ol itspresentation. Attention has been called to 
Play Con- the necessity of a sympathetic knowledge of 
ditioned child life. Child psychology and child study 
by Imagi- have been reviewed for the purpose of impressing nation. 3 ¥ 
upon the mind the predominant mental char- 
acteristics of the child at each stage of the elementary 
course. The teacher has learned that the child enters 
school in what is known as the play stage of his develop- 
ment, and that his play serves as an index of certain 
interests, capacities, and even epochs of development or 
stages of growth. The importance of the child’s play is 
conditioned largely by the share the imagination has in it. 
Consequently, the teacher’s first problem is to find history 
material or material from other social fields which will 
enrich the pupil’s imagination, lay a foundation for the 
future study of history, and enlarge his personality. 
The externals of history, such as pageants, roadmaking, 
houses, scenes or explorations, clothing, and amusements, 
ean be vividly reproduced by the mental processes of a 
child of eight or nine. Such a reproduction, however, is 
possible only when the senses and the memory of the 
learner are adequately trained to furnish the necessary

determined by the character of the images which pre- 
dominate therein. In the opinion of those who have 
investigated most thoroughly, the visual type is the type 
to which the majority of people belong. Visual images 
predominate in their thinking. George Sand was a 
good visualizer in mature life. As a child her imagina- 
tion was fertile, and it is well described by Sully in his 
studies of childhood. The painter Doré was a good 
visualizer. Many famous painters, sculptors, architects, 
and inventors belong to this class. Some well-dressed 
women and milliners have imagery of this character. 
On the other hand, some eminent painters and sculptors 
claim that they belong to the motor type and that tactile 
images are utilized by them. Their images are of the 
motions necessary to produce the figure or the statue, 
and while they recognize both colors and form readily, 
they are not able to imagine them. 
(2) Auditory type. The auditory type is less common 
than the visual. Many musicians belong to this type. 
The concrete auditory imagination belongs in some 
degree, however, to all who can recall voices and melo- 
dies. The auditory type is frequently combined closely 
with imagery of the motor-tactual sort. It seems to 
have been so combined in the great Beethoven, who com- 
posed his symphonies when unable to hear a single note. 
(3) Motor type. In the motor type images of move- 
ment predominate. All of us depend largely upon motor 
images. Probably the blind deaf-mutes and the blind 
are especially dependent on such images, but they also 
make use of tactile images. Laura Bridgman and Helen 
Keller are often cited as examples of the tactile-motor type 
of imagination.  
-P-A-G-E-43

(4) Tactiles are those who reproduce in imagination 
impressions from the dermal senses. Most people can 
reproduce images of touch with some degree of vividness, 
the feel of velvet, the feel of dough or putty, of a polished 
or a rough surface. A blind person’s sense of touch is 
keener in some respects than that of one who can see. 
This type of imagery is usually combined closely with 
motor imagery. 
Allied to images of movement and touch are images 
of pressure and of smell and taste. The most significant 
pressure images are those of internal pressure occasioned 
by bodily movement, such as the image of the feeling of 
shortened breath in wheeling a bicycle up hill. Smell 
and taste images are not so frequent. Some psycholo- 
gists say there are no such images, but on the other hand, 
some intelligent persons maintain that they are conscious 
of odors such as the smell of tar, or burning sulphur, or 
furnace gas, or mignonette, or spices and mixed per- 
fumes when absorbed in imagining certain scenes or 
situations. : 
(5) The mixed type is sometimes called the normal 
type. This is the form of imagination in which several 
sense types are combined, no one of them being especially 
prominent. A good illustration of this is the manner 
in which one reproduces in his imagination an alumni 
dinner, or a commencement, or a reception, or a small 
dinner party. Imagery of several sense types combine 
for most of us while the scene is being reproduced. There 
are the combination sounds of laughter, of music, of con- 
versation. There are the colors of the dresses, of the 
decorations, of the china, of the fruit, of the favors; the 
odor of flowers and food, and possibly the feel of cut glass,
-P-A-G-E-44

  soft damask, or delicate china. Many distinguished men 
of history had imagination of this sort. The era of the 
Renaissance alone abounds in numerous illustrations, 
such as Alberti, Verrochio, Leonardo da Vinci, Benvenuto 
Cellini, and Michael Angelo, ‘‘the man of four souls,” — 
sculptor, architect, painter, and poet. 
Contrasted with this concrete imagination, that is, the 
imagination of objects, scenes, and events, we have 
Wacbal verbal or symbolic imagination. It is well for 
Imagina- primary teachers to emphasize in their minds 
tion. the fact that words are only conventional symbols. 
Experienced teachers often find that word images have 
taken the place of what should be a rich experience with 
young children. They are able to make a verbal report 
in history because they remember the words as they ap- 
peared on the page of their history book, or as they have 
heard them from the teacher’s lips. But the words are 
quite meaningless to them and do. not call up images 
that either feast the eye or delight the ear. This is an 
artificial state of affairs which impoverishes the child’s 
experience. Nothing worth while can be done in study- 
ing history unless the pupils can have the concrete images 
that the language of the teacher, or the child, or the text 
suggests. 
There are various types of verbal or symbolic imagina- 
tion also depending upon the predominating type of 
imagery, so that we have: 
1. Visual verbal imagery. 
2. Auditory verbal imagery. 
8. Motor verbal imagery. 
4. Tactile verbal imagery. 
5. Mixed verbal imagery.
-P-A-G-E-45
  FUNCTION OF IMAGINATION 33 
As illustrations of these forms of imagination, outside 
the schoolroom, we have the orator who sees his manu- 
script in his mind’s eye when he is delivering his iycesct 
oration without manuscript ; the minister who Verbal 
can see his written sermon in the same way ; Imagina- 
and the musician who can see in his mind’s eye #°” 
the score. These are all types of visual verbal, or symbolic 
imagination. Playwrights tell us that when writing the 
parts of a play they can hear the actor’s voice in each 
phrase. The poet, who suits his words to sound, images 
the words as heard when he writes. Sometimes one hears 
again, as it were, one’s own words or those of another. 
This is auditory verbal imagination. Or one may im- 
agine the movement of the lips and throat and get 
control of the word through a sense of movement in motor 
images. This is verbal imagination of the motor type. 
The mixed tactile-auditory or tactual-motor is the type 
in which one has the image of both hearing and feeling 
one’s self talk. It is the common form of verbal imagery. 
When a child whispers the words as he reads, does he 
gain images of articulation, or of hearing? Or of both? 
These images may be divorced, for if they could not be, 
no deaf-mute could be taught to talk. 
So far, in classifying imagination, we have looked at 
our image-consciousness from the point of view of the 
most predominant sense order of images utilized. That 
gave us concrete imagination of five types, and also verbal 
symbolic imagination of five types. We may, however, re- 
gard our imaginative processes from another point of view. 
When any individual reproduces in his imagination 
the places he has seen, the music he has heard, or the 
events he has already lived through, or heard about, his

imagination is said to be reproductive imagination. On 
the other hand, when he imagines relatively new faces, 
new scenes, new environments, by selecting only 
ps such qualities as he chooses for a particular 
and purpose and thus making novel combinations, 
Creative his imagination is called creative imagination. 
oer This classification of imagination is based upon 
i the distinction between the repeated experience 
and the relatively novel experience. 
A definite purpose is one of the distinctive character- 
istics of creative imagination that is fully matured. This 
creative imagination may be manifested in the field of 
mechanical invention, or science, or art. In Purpose z ais . a each case there are certain restrictions imposed. 
Creative The combination of mechanical contrivances 
Imagina~ must be such as will work, if the invention is to 
aa be successful. The hypotheses formed by the 
imagination of the man of science must stand the crucial 
test when submitted. And in a similar way, the imagina- 
tive artist must test the product of his imagination to 
see if it is a true expression of the ideals which he would 
embody in the materials of his art if he hopes to present 
to our view such masterpieces as the “Apollo Belvidere” 
or the ‘‘Sistine Madonna”’ or ‘‘Othello.”’ 
In productive (¢.e. mature creative) imagination the 
mind does not weave together factors of experience 
Criticism Capriciously, but rather under the guidance of 
of Imagi- conditions which limit the freedom of the con- 
co structive process. The extent to which imagi- 
nations are criticized naturally depends upon the stage 
of development of the individual who possesses them, 
and upon the type of ideas under examination. For

instance, the savage thinks of the thunder or the wind 
as a personal agency. To an adult accustomed to our 
modern scientific ways of thinking, the myths of early 
peoples seem like the play of the most capricious imagina- 
tion ; but to a young mind, untrained in forms of critical 
scientific imagination, nothing could seem more natural 
than just such explanations. A child derives much 
pleasure from the personification of his toys, but the 
adult is so clearly conscious of the falsity of these same 
imaginations that he could derive little pleasure from 
them. The imaginations in early life are not subjected 
to any careful criticism. The child’s experience is too 
meager to allow him to construct any system of thought 
that can serve as a basis for the criticism of his particular 
imagination. As one approaches maturity, the indul- 
gence in fanciful imaginations unchecked by criticism 
becomes less and less common. 
When one attempts to reconstruct some system of 
thought which deals with human interests and human 
activities, and the reconstruction agrees with yistory

periods of time, we call it history and we demand Fiction. 
that it shall conform tothe canons of congruity with 
all the legitimate records of the period in question. If, 
on the other hand, the reconstruction aims to be free 
from any particular reference to definite situations, it is 
not history, but imaginative literature, and is known as 
fiction. But as fiction it must bear certain relations to 
experience ; a wholly unnatural creation has no justifica- 
tion even in fiction. The principles of combination must 
be recognized as principles in harmony with the general 
nature of human experiences.

From the above discussion the elementary teacher 
can readily see the primary importance of sense train- 
Pies ing. It is only through imagination combined

ulates into the feelings, or understand the motives and

‘through the imagination that the past lives for 
us and clothes itself with meaning. 
No normal person is wholly unimaginative. Almost 
everybody is capable of rousing within his consciousness 
vivid and accurate images of some kind. The experience of 
Helen Keller is a source of encouragement to all connected 
with the teaching of history. She is a conspicuous illus- 
tration of a person blind and deaf from childhood ; con- 
sequently she has neither visual nor auditory images. 
Nevertheless, we know she has peculiarly vivid and 
detailed images of pressure, movements, and even of 
taste and smell. The crudity of imagination in many 
adults is due largely to defective education. Sense 
material, such as armor, uniforms, pictures, stories, and 
poetry, all have power to stimulate imagination. The 
story will help to enrich the child’s personal experience 
and increase his comprehension. Gesture and pantomime 
and dramatization will help to secure imagery and ex- 
pression. The teacher must appeal to the mind by as 
many avenues as possible, — eyes, ears, hands, vocal 
organs. There must be drawings, diagrams, and other 
graphic illustrations for the eye-minded, and construction 
work to stimulate motor and tactual motor images. The 
motor side should receive more emphasis than it has in 
the past. It has been unduly neglected.
-P-A-G-E-49
  FUNCTION OF IMAGINATION 37 
The child of to-day is far better off in the matter of 
pictorial illustration than were the children of his grand- 
father’s day. Our illustrators present things outwardly 
as they really were. So there is little excuse for the teacher 
who fails to show children that the mere outward appear- 
ance of men, women, houses, furniture, and conveyances 
of a bygone time differ materially from the outward 
appearance of people and similar objects to-day. In 
matters of dress, customs, home surroundings, means of 
travel, the teacher must see to it that the pupil does not, 
for instance, picture the Greek in a frock coat riding in 
an automobile, or the Roman in a high silk hat. The 
child must realize that neither Greek nor Roman used 
damask napkins of Irish linen at their banquets; that 
the early Teuton did not live in a palace of marble. It 
is easy also for the teacher to make vivid and clear the 
crude, primitive life of our American ancestors so that 
the pupil may realize that they ate coarse food, wore 
coarse clothing, and endured the hardships incident to 
life in the wilderness without good roads or easy carriages ; 
with no railroads or trolleys; with only clumsy boats, 
lumbering stagecoaches, and buffalo trails, Indian trails, 
or bridle paths. 
The picturesque and panoramic in history help to give 
atmosphere and perspective and, when properly presented, 
will enable the child to picture life in other lands. Such 
processes widen his horizon, enlarge his sympathies, and 
tend to prevent vulgarity and narrowness. The value 
of all such work can hardly be overestimated as prepara- 
tion for the later stages of history work. It is still sadly 
neglected in far too many places.

THE SAND TABLE AND ITS USES 
Tue type lessons in this book under the work outlined 
for grade one show how the sand table can be utilized 
by the children in expressing the experiences a e A Means 
they are gaining from their everyday observa- o¢ px. 
tions, e.g. the route of the milkman is modeled pressing 
in the sand, so as to show the roads and streets I™mpres- 
upon which he travels. If he crosses creeks or eee a 
rivers, they are traced, and the bridges are con- from 
structed. Even the bottles that he leaves and Everyday 
collects are there. The sand table also offers F*Pe 
an opportunity to arrange a farmyard or to show Seger 
the display of a grocer’s window. The route of any excur- 
sion made by the children can be modeled in the sand and 
then criticized by classmates and teacher. Such work 
helps the children to secure adequate conceptions of the 
area visited. Moss, grass, toy animals, paper dolls, and 
building blocks can be used to make the scene seem real. 
Freedom in expression, and definite, clear-cut imagery 
are the aims to be kept in view. 
The sand table is also one of the best means of express- 
ing a child’s conception of a situation as a whole. Such 
work discloses correct or incorrect conceptions through- 
out elementary work. E.g. an Indian village, or the 
caves, or brush huts, or the long house of bark can be 
constructed on the sand table. The country of the tree

way the surplus water is forced to go when the windmills 
are at work. In a similar way child life in Germany and 
France may be represented as indicated in work out- 
lined for grade three. All this helps to make real the 
distant scenes. 
The child’s self-activity in connection with the sand 
table makes a strong appeal to his instincts of expression, 
constructiveness, and sociability. Impressions Appeals é 5

  to fix ideas, but to clarify and enlarge them, and even to 
furnish new ideas. ay thought tends to issue in some 
form of motor activity; and unless the motor phase is 
developed, the idea does not come to completeness. 
Motor images are an important part of every one’s 
mental equipment, consequently primary teachers should 
suggest activities — something for the children to do 
rather than something for them to listen to. Primary 
children should get not only clear images, but a personal 
feeling for the realities imaged. The free play at the 
sand table helps to secure that personal feeling. The 
problems that the pupils solve, the occupations that 
they imitate or reénact, are all points of departure from 
which children may be led to appreciate something of 
the nature of the historic development of man. 
Every possible encouragement should be given to the 
child’s impulses and tendencies to create. Intelligent 
Develaps and serious attention should be given to the 
Ideas of | Child’s present needs and capabilities. Only 
Space those teachers who have worked with first grade 
Relations. children realize how very vague a child’s ideas 
of space relations are and how activity in connection with 
a sand table may enable him to get definite impressions 
of relative location. 
From the standpoint of psychology, how does any 
child gain primary and fundamental perceptions of space? 
Is it not through the motor sense? When we move our 
hands and feet we experience sensations of strain, motion, 
of spending energy. This the mind interprets as space. 
The tactile and motor senses furnish the fundamental 
elements of our perceptual world. They give a sense 
of reality to our percepts. ‘‘The space which we say
-P-A-G-E-57
“dOOHUOGHDIAN HOLA VW

-P-A-G-E-58
    
46 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
we see is literally hand made. From a psychological 
point of view, space is that in which one can move. The 
amount of energy spent in moving is the measure of the 
space moved in.” In order to secure accurate and care- 
fully arranged imagery from verbal description, which is 
the form in which most of his history must come, a child 
must be familiar with established standards of form, size, 
distance, and space relations. Such familiarity the sand 
table will help him to secure if his activities are wisely 
directed. 
Because the mind of a child and its modifications can 
be known only through external expression, the teacher 
must study carefully the various ways of providing stimuli 
that may be utilized to produce efficient reactions. She 
must also consider how reactions may influence intellec- 
tual processes. The more opportunities a child has for 
expression the clearer will his impressions become. 
Every child’s notions of space are vague until his mus- 
cular experiences render them clear and precise. His 
notions of distance are made clear by actually measuring 
and testing. Until he has reached and traveled and made 
use of his eye movements, he cannot get a knowledge of 
space. Retinal images alone will not suffice. The eye 
movement supplements or contributes much of the data. 
Space in two dimensions or in three is realized through 
explorations accompanied by eye movements. Thus we 
see that notions of space are all primarily built up from 
muscular experiences. A child must also actually: lift 
a pound and an ounce to get a clear idea of them. 
All of our notions of weight, size, distance, hardness, 
roughness, are dependent upon motor activity. Whole 
classes of ideas would remain vague and incomplete with-
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE SAND TABLE AND ITS USES 47 
out the knowledge furnished through the motor activities. 
The child’s proper method of gaining knowledge is through 
his senses aided by motor activity. The child’s mind 
may disclose itself in talking, drawing, construction work 
of various kinds, singing, and planning. The objective 
result expressed through muscular activity helps the 
teacher to infer something of his perceptions, memories, 
motives, choices, aims, hopes, joys, or sorrows. 
In order to picture an historic scene or situation in a 
world beyond the child’s immediate surroundings, he 
must arrange his images and represent them y,146 o¢ 
according to description, not fancy. By con- Concrete 
structive imagination he relates and combines Instruc- 
the standard images with which he is familiar °* 
according to description. Some facts of history, some 
historic situations and conditions, are so remote, so far 
removed from the realm of a child’s experience, that they 
have no point of contact with his thinking. After he 
has had some background of present-day experience 
through which to view them they may be in a measure 
comprehended by him. No greater pedagogical blunder 
could be made than to neglect concrete instruction in the 
early grades. The child needs concrete experiences to 
call forth his responses. Although he lives in the midst of 
complex social and industrial conditions, he can respond 
only to that for which his stage of development has at- 
tuned him. The sand table problems give the child 
motives and make the work seem worth while.

USE OF PICTURES IN PRIMARY GRADES 
Some city children have never seen grain growing. 
They have no mental picture of how a waving field of 
Value of Wheat looks, either when it is green or when it is 
the Picture ready to harvest. They have never played 
to the among “‘haycocks,’”’ and the expression is not 
ee filled with meaning to them. They have never 
seen large fields of daisies. Cherries or apples or nuts 
on trees, and berries on vines or bushes are to them 
unfamiliar sights. They have not seen cows driven to 
pasture, or coming home to be milked, or going to get 
salt or a drink of water. They have not coaxed fish to 
nibble at a dainty morsel on a bent pin fastened to a 
thread and dropped into a cool, willow-shaded brook. 
Good pictures will help such children to learn of all these 
familiar experiences of the country child, and furnish 
their imagination the necessary material with which to 
picture the scenes and situations. 
In a similar manner, the country children may learn 
of the daily traffic in a busy city street ; the trains coming 
into and going out of the large railway stations, the great 
ocean liners at the docks; the Labor Day parade, the 
circus parade, and the various social and civic parades ; 
the decorations on holidays or festive occasions; the 
ways in which the streets are cleaned, and fires are ex- 
tinguished, and what “‘a run to a fire” is like; the ap-

pearance of the large stores and shops and public build- 
ings; the arrangement of parks and playgrounds and the 
apparatus used in the latter. 
Both city children and country children gain much 
insight into life in other lands and a knowledge of the 
manners and customs of other days in our own land, 
from pictures. All this has great value in preparing 
them to understand the books they will read later.

crude. They prefer primary colors. Their next pref- 
erence is for the warm coloring of nature. They want 
action in a picture, and to please them the picture must 
“tell a story.” They are easily confused by much de- 
tail in a picture ; consequently the teacher should choose 
for them pictures drawn with large, simple lines, and only 
such detail as helps to interpret the story which the 
picture tells them. They are interested in railroad trains, 
in ships, in firemen, in soldiers, in workingmen at work, in 
dolls’ housekeeping. All of these can be utilized easily 
in school instruction. Choose pictures telling in sequence 
whole tales of wonder and action, such as E. Boyd Smith’s 
“Farm Book,’ which shows pictures of plowing, sow- 
ing, reaping, churning, feeding chickens, and going to 
market; or ‘‘Nos Enfants” (French children), shown in 
colored pictures by Boutet de Monvel, or “Filles et 
Garcons” by the same illustrator, or ‘Four and Twenty 
Toilers,” picturing English scenes, illustrations by Bedford.

tures heavily printed in black and white, the merely 
decorative illustration, and even the photographic re- 
production, unless it tells a story. Illustrations in 
black and white that tell a story simply, and in a 
human way, will interest the children, and pictures that 
interest them easily stir their imaginations and produce 
educative results in keener realization, greater curiosity, 
and renewed zeal to learn more.

greatly appreciated by children are Cruikshank (in fairy 
tales), Caldecott (in humorous works), Walter Crane, 
in his delightful sequences of pictures, each of which 
is warm and rich in coloring and tells a story (nursery 
literature), Sir John Tenniel (illustrations of ‘Alice 
in Wonderland’’), Boutet de Monvel, referred to 
before, and Kate Greenaway, who expresses the joy and 
the delicacy that characterize happy childhood and the 
freshness of the glad springtime. L. Leslie Brooke’s color- 
ing is attractive to children, and the funny detail of his 
pictures convulses a young child with laughter. Arthur 
Rackham’s soft ivory effects illustrating nursery rhymes 
and stories please wsthetic children. Helen Stratton 
handles primary colors in a way that causes them to 
lose much of their crudeness. She illustrates nursery 
tales in large, simple lines, very pleasing to little children.

USE OF PICTURES IN PRIMARY GRADES 51 
Among Americans who suit the child’s point of view 
well in some of their illustrative work are the Rhead 
brothers, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Jessie Willcox Smith, 
and Maxfield Parrish. Much of their work is not suited 
to children’s needs for reasons mentioned above. Other 
American artists who have already achieved notable 
success in meeting the needs of children are Howard 
Pyle, Frederic Remington, E. Boyd Smith, Palmer Cox, 
Gelett Burgess, Peter Newell, and Reginald Birch. The 
grotesque drawings of Palmer Cox, Gelett Burgess, and 
Peter Newell satisfy the child’s embryonic sense of 
humor. He considers them “rollicking good’ books 
and shakes with laughter as he turns the pages of, e.g., 
“Brownie Books,’ ‘‘Goops and How to be Them,’ 
“Topsys and Turvys.” They have a tendency to dis- 
place the ‘Buster Brown” and “‘Foxy Grandpa” variety 
of pictures. 
There are also a few artists, English and American, 
employed in illustrating juvenile fiction, St. Nicholas, 
primers, first readers, and supplementary readers. They 
keep close to the children’s interests and select and present 
subject-matter that helps children greatly in visualizing 
distant scenes and situations. Lucy Fitch Perkins, Hope 
Dunlap, Blanche Ostertag, M. W. Enright, Beatrix 
Potter, M. L. Kirk, T. H. Robinson, and A. G. Walker 
are in this group of illustrators. By going carefully over 
the kind of work described above the inexperienced teacher 
learns by experience the appeal that the best illustrations 
make. She gets from them standards by which to test 
other illustrations. Some of them come in cheap editions. 
Many of them are expensive. 
Our illustrated magazines often contain pictures that

are excellent both from the standpoint of children’s in- 
terests and from the artistic point of view. Even the ad- 
vertising section is valuable to the teacher for its pictures, 
e.g. pictures advertising chocolate, soaps, cereals, ete. 
Gift calendars used for advertising are often excellent 
for the primary teacher’s purpose. Postcards in color, 
grouped in series, are easily obtained and help to make 
life in other lands real.

in a way that tends to confuse or mystify the child. Even

Pictures. taken to help the child to acquire standards 
by which to judge the actual size of objects seen in 
a picture. For example, the teacher may place a full- 
length cabinet-sized photograph of herself in plain view. 
After allowing the children time to recognize it and 
realize that it represents her ‘‘standing up,” she may stand 
up beside the photograph and give them an opportunity 
to see that it is really very much shorter than her ‘‘real 
self.” After a series of opportunities to observe and 
compare under skillful guidance, children realize that 
objects in a picture represent only relative size, just as 
the representations on the sand table show relative dis- 
tance. A picture of a mother and child shows that the 
child is smaller than the mother; a picture of hens and 
chickens, a cat and kittens, etc., illustrates the point. 
But the child is still in danger of inferring that a cow is 
probably two or three inches high, or about the size of 
his closed fist, if he has never seena real cow. The teacher 
must be ever on the alert to guard against such perfectly 
natural errors of childhood.  
-P-A-G-E-65
USE OF PICTURES IN PRIMARY GRADES 53 
In a similar way, owing to lack of knowledge of the laws 
of perspective, objects shown in the background of a 
picture will not tell the real facts to a child; and again, 
when he draws the picture of an apple, he puts the seeds 
in where he knows they are, and he draws the feet in the 
shoes so that you can see them. The fact that the seeds 
and the feet cannot be seen while the apple is uncut and 
the shoes laced, and so should not be represented, has to 
be learned by him. 
It is very easy for the inexperienced teacher to fall into 
the error of supposing that because the picture is quite 
clear to her in every respect, it is equally so to the child. 
Still one other illustration: a row of cattle headed for a 
stream means to the child large cattle in the foreground 
and little cattle in the rear of the line, although as a 
matter of fact the largest animals may be the last. The 
experience of country children teaches them while still 
quite young that horses two miles away are not colts, 
although they seem so to the eye; but it takes numerous 
excursions to make some of these elementary notions 
clear to the city child. He can interpret city life far 
more accurately than his country cousin because of his 
numerous experiences with it. He does not expect the 
houses on the opposite sides of the street to meet in a line 
a few blocks ahead of him, for instance. 
The teacher must question to see that the objects or 
purposes she had in mind in using the picture are achieved, 
and endeavor to select pictures that show clearly what is 
wanted, and include nothing more. Even in such cases 
the problem of size must be kept in mind, e.g. she may 
be showing the picture of a single sheep to show how the 
wool looks on the sheep, and her object is to prevent the
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
child from thinking that ‘‘skeins of woolen yarn” are 
found ready-made on a sheep’s back. Consequently 
she chooses a large picture to give the children a vivid 
impression of the wool. If she says nothing about the 
size of the animal, and the children have never seen a 
real sheep but do know that the animal is still larger than 
the picture, and if they have seen a picture of a whole 
herd of cattle the previous day, they quite naturally 
infer that an ox is smaller than a sheep. 
In using pictures eternal vigilance is necessary to 
guard against a wrong ‘‘first impression,” for the good 
picture clearly perceived makes a strong appeal to the 
child, and the first impression is likely to remain the 
permanent one. Constant comparison with well-known 
standards that can be seen or easily understood will be 
necessary when using pictures, to convey correct im- 
pressions of life in other lands, or in our own land in other 
days. The images which the child really gets, not what 
the teacher hoped he might get, are the net result of 
the work. 
1. Some teachers use too many pictures. The child 
may be interested in handling them, but the thoughts

use or gest are far from the purpose the teacher had 
abuse of in mind in presenting the pictures. Conse- 
Pictures. quently the pictures defeat the end for which 
they were used. 
2. Some teachers select pictures that are excellent from 
the point of view of art, which are unsuited to the child’s 
age or stage of development because they are so far re- 
moved from his conceptions of everyday life. They are 
mystical or abstract to him.
-P-A-G-E-67
  USE OF PICTURES IN PRIMARY GRADES 55 
3. Careful questioning is often necessary to help the 
child to really see the points the teacher wishes to em- 
phasize. 
a. The picture may suggest only in part what the child 
has previously learned, and the teacher is trying 
to stimulate the child’s memory to reproduce the 
full particulars. 
b. The teacher’s aim may be to stimulate more careful 
observation, to aid the child in gaining control of 
his imagination by educating the perceptions to 
truer discernment. 
c. The teacher’s aim may be to stimulate comparison 
and thus lead the child into fuller knowledge. 
All these aims may be defeated by lack of care in choos- 
ing the picture or lack of skill in questioning. 
4. Some teachers use pictures merely to cover up their 
own lack of preparation. This is abusing a valuable tool.
-P-A-G-E-68
  Chapter III 
CONSTRUCTION WORK 
Tue pedagogical principle underlying all the construc- 
tive activities of children is that Doing is essential to the 
Aimsin learning process. The first-grade teacher who 
Construc- asks little children to illustrate a story by draw- 
tion Work. ing is not aiming to increase the child’s artistic 
sense, or to give him an opportunity to acquire skill in 
drawing. Her specific aim is to assist him in getting 
clear, definite images from the story. She makes use of 
his instinctive tendency to make something, or to do 
something, by suggesting a specific direction in which his 
self-activity may be expressed in such a way as to achieve 
a result that gives pleasure to himself. The character 
of his product indicates to the teacher the kind of images 
the child has obtained from the story. The child in- 
cidentally gains some control of tools and materials and 
is getting the experience of working with a definite pur- 
pose in view. Her aim in asking the child to model an 
animal in clay to be used later in a sand table representa- 
tion of farm life is not to give him an opportunity to 
acquire skill in modeling animal life, but rather to make 
use of his present interest in farm life to stimulate him 
to observe carefully and image clearly the outward form 
and appearance of a domestic animal that he has seen. 
The child’s interest is in the finished product. He is 
interested in what he can do with the clay animal when 
56 oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
CONSTRUCTION WORK 57 
made. He is interested in what it is good for to himself 
and to other members of the class. The various ways 
in which it can be used in play are what appeals to him. 
The teacher, on the other hand, is interested chiefly 
in the images he is getting, in the will training that results 
from his persistent, purposeful effort which is now as- 
suming tangible shape and may be the embodiment of 
his definite aim and a source of encouragement for future 
efforts. If his dog and his cow look so much alike that 
the one cannot be distinguished readily from the other, 
they will not satisfy his purpose; and he must try again 
and again, until he can feel that he has actually achieved 
what he undertook to do. When he succeeds in his aim, 
the immediate purpose the teacher had in view is also 
accomplished. 
Of course the teacher must be conscious of the child’s 
attitude, must think in his terms, and talk about the 
problem undertaken from his point of view. She must 
also keep clearly in mind her own specific aim of stimu- 
lating and directing his mental growth through self- 
activity, but she must be very careful to say nothing to 
the child about her pedagogical purposes. She must 
talk to him about his individual purposes and appeal to 
his present interests. 
The following suggestions are gathered from the ex- 
perience of teachers who are securing excellent results : 
1. Each problem in construction work assigned by 
the teacher must have a social significance which gugges- 
the child can appreciate either because he can tions 
play with the product when made, or because Concern 
he can get pleasure out of it by presenting it as _,° aoe 2 p struction 
a gift to some one who will greatly appreciate work.

it, or because he can contribute it to the general scheme 
for the decoration of a Christmas tree, etc.; and every 
problem must grow naturally out of the daily work. 
2. The teacher should be careful at first to set problems 
so simple on the mechanical side that the pupil will need 
little assistance and she must remember that the activi- 
ties which demand the use of the larger muscles only should 
come in the first half of the year. Any activities which 
demand finer coérdination should come later. 
3. The materials used need not be expensive. Their 
educational value to the child is not dependent upon the 
cost of the equipment. But the materials selected 
should be: (a) such as he can manipulate easily, e.g. 
clay, sand, beads, crayon and paper, etc. ; (b) such as can 
be procured easily, e.g. twigs, cord, pasteboard boxes, 
ribbon bolts, ete. 
4. In the earliest work only such problems as can be 
completed in short periods of time should be assigned, 
so as to secure concentration of attention and persever- 
ance to the end. 
5. The teacher must keep in mind three things in sug- 
gesting and directing the construction work: first, she 
should utilize a present interest in the problem, or arouse 
or stimulate an interest in the object to be made, before 
the work is undertaken ; second, she should see that the 
child has every possible opportunity to get a clear image 
of the object he is to make; third, she should encourage 
the child to persevere in his effort until the construction 
is completed. 
6. When a child can see possibilities in the material he 
is using and is also alert in making use of them, the 
teacher has every reason to feel that the child has achieved

manual training, etc., it would be eminently wise to leave 
the immediate supervision of first grade construction work 
with the regular first grade teacher. Doubtless she will 
not have the skill in any special line that should be ex- 
pected of the specialist, but she should hold herself re- 
sponsible for guiding the growth of the child in all direc- 
tions. She can do this more readily if she has first-hand 
knowledge of his various ways of reacting to stimuli. The 
nature of his responses in one line of interest often gives 
her the clew as to the best ways of planning other work. 
The specialist should confer with the first grade teacher 
and give suggestions and criticisms. Every first grade 
teacher should feel sufficient confidence in her own ability 
to direct the work she expects her pupils to do, but ex- 
pert execution in all lines should not be expected of any 
first grade teacher.

a simple doll’s house out of a packing box divided into 
rooms by board partitions, or use cardboard boxes of 
uniform size for rooms, they have the satisfaction and 
pleasure of knowing that the house is their very own. If

kindness or courtesy of others, an obligation is created 
which they should recognize, appreciate, and reciprocate. 
In any case, the joy of playing with the house, the re-

and the treatment of the walls and floors, as well as the 
responsibility of keeping it clean, will teach them many

around which may be grouped many minor interests. 
In making the furniture the teacher may direct the 
work of the children during a regular school period. Or 
the children may be given permission to construct the 
furniture from material found at home without the direct 
help of the teacher. The house may be refurnished from 
time to time according to various plans. The materials 
used for the furniture may be small blocks of wood to 
which children nail slabs, or cardboard boxes, spools, 
ribbon bolts, corrugated paper, clay, tinfoil, or other

stiff drawing paper based on folding it into sixteen squares. 
The dolls may be cut from magazines and colored, or 
raffia may be tied in bundles to form dolls. Brooms for 
sweeping the doll’s house may be made by tying raffia 
in bundles also. The rugs may be woven out of either 
raffia or carpet rags with carpet warp. 
2. A large picture book made of Manila paper may 
form another large center of interest and give opportunity 
for codperative work. When completed, it may be sent 
to the children’s ward of a hospital, or to some individual 
in the local community in which the school is located to 
whom it would give pleasure. Such a book may contain 
the illustrated stories of the home and the family life, 
or an illustrated story representing the doll’s house and 
its furnishings, having one large page to represent each 
room. Or it may be an illustrated story of farm life, 
and contain representations of collections of fruits, 
flowers, vegetables, and animals. In each case pictures 
may be cut from magazines and may be arranged and 
mounted with care. Or the representations may be 
freehand cutting so arranged and mounted. Such a 
definite purpose serves to keep up the child’s interest 
in his work, inculcates painstaking care, and results in 
a certain degree of skill in manipulating material, not 
easily secured in any other way. In addition to all this, 
the exhilaration of the pleasure he helped to give is a large 
return.

for any festal occasion may be made by the children --

III. Arrangement and Selection of Subject Matter. 
A. Order of topics should be determined by needs of 
the pupils and the condition of the community 
in which school is located. 
1. Topics selected must be in the plane of the 
child’s experience and chosen from his im- 
mediate surroundings. 
Illustrations: 
a. Home life on a farm. 
b. Home life in a small village. 
c. Home life in a large city. 
2. The topic must be something that appeals 
strongly to the child’s interest just now. 
In general, to follow the cycle of the seasons 
will be safe. 
Illustrations: 
a. The family’s preparations for winter, spring, 
summer, etc., furnish topics concerning 
which the child will have much to say. 
b. Coming to school helps the child to ap- 
preciate how useful the policeman is on 
crowded streets, on stormy days.

TYPE LESSONS FOR GRADE ONE 
I. Conversational lessons in connection with the 
family. 
A. The family as a unit.    The child needs to get the idea of a “ group 
unit ” before he can understand the rela- 
tion of one unit to the group. For con- 
veying this idea, the teacher should use 
such pictures as a family of cats, a family 
of squirrels, a family of rabbits, ete. These 
may be obtained from the collection of 
Perry pictures. 
1. With a picture of a human family, teacher 
asks such questions as —

children to show her who belong to the 
family, and to point as they tell.] 
2. With a picture of a family of animals, eg. 
bears, teacher asks : 
a. What kind of family is this? 
b. Show me which bears belong to this family. 
3. Similar work with other families of animals.

II. Suggestions for an Excursion. 
Tur SHor Store 
[The purpose of all excursions and conversa- 
tional lessons should be to help the child to 
understand his environment and his own relation 
to it. Hence, the point of departure should 
always be the object or experience with which 
the child is familiar.] 
A. Preparation. 
1. Begin with some child’s pair of new shoes, or 
newly-soled shoes, or a discussion of shoes 
in connection with the change of seasons 
and warm winter clothing. Get the children 
to tell what they know about shoes, their 
purchase, material, making, and mending. 
2. Tell them a very kind storekeeper has invited 
them to his store to see his shoes and learn 
how shoes are mended. Emphasize the 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
expected kindness and courtesy on the part 
of all who accept his invitation. Make 
clear what is to be looked for in the shop, 
e.g. materials, tools. 
B. The excursion. 
1. It is necessary to have a trustworthy and 
obedient person at the head and foot of the 
line. It may be a coveted honor for a child 
to be trusted there, because of street cross- 
ings and the care of smaller children. 
2. At the store it will be necessary for all to be 
quiet, unless addressed. The teacher will 
need to have each thing of interest pointed 
out and named, or many children will see 
very little for themselves. If the place is 
small, a few at a time may watch the work. 
They should know the names of materials 
and tools they see the cobbler using, and 
have a little time to watch the work grow. 
On leaving, they should all thank the store- 
keeper for his kindness. 
C. Activities in connection with the excursion. 
1. The next day ascertain what each child has 
gained from the excursion. A good way to 
make each feel equally responsible and pre- 
vent one from monopolizing the conversa- 
tion is to have a child describe one thing 
he saw, the next a different thing, etc. 
2. Draw pictures of the tools on the blackboard, 
and see if: children can remember their 
names and uses.  
-P-A-G-E-101
  
FIRST GRADE WORK 89 
3. Let some child play he is a cobbler and do 
what he saw the cobbler doing. Let others 
guess what he is doing. Let another show 
something else, ete. 
4. Show pictures of a cobbler at work and let 
children tell all they can about the picture. 
5. Show a picture of a big factory and tell chil- 
dren that most of our shoes are made in a 
large factory with machines. 
6. Give children paper and pencil, or blackboard 
space, and let them draw a picture of a 
cobbler doing something, or of the shoe- 
store window. Have children hold up 
finished pictures and describe them. 
7. Have children cut out shoes in pairs, free- 
hand, from paper, black, white, large, small, 
high, low. Mount on a sheet of paper on 
which a window is drawn and arrange for 
the window display of the shoe store. 
8. Let children put some in boxes in pairs and 
play store. Children buy and sell, make 
believe fit them, and pay for them. 
9. Teach song, “The Little Wee Man” — 
Gaynor. 
. Tell stories such as — 
“Goody Two Shoes.”” 
“The Fairy Shoes.” e 
= 
III. Suggestions for a Series of Lessons in Connection 
with Farm Life. 
A. General preparation. 
1. The child must have clearly defined ideas of —  
-P-A-G-E-102
90 
os 
Qs 
a. 
  SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
. Open space in fields. 
. How live farm animals really look and 
act. 
. How seeds and plants grow. 
. Appearance of fruit, vegetables, grain, and 
other farm products. 
. Simple methods of transportation by bar- 
row, wagon, train, ete. 
. These ideas may be gained in the following 
ways: 
By making an excursion to a large park. 
b. By visiting the county fair. 
c. By planting seeds in window gardens or 
school gardens and watching the plants 
grow. 
By noticing the appearance of fruit, vege- 
tables, grain, etc., as they may see them 
in their own homes, in store windows, or 
in the schoolroom. 
. By watching for evidences of how farm 
products are brought to the city. 
Nore to Tracuer.— An excursion to a farm 
would naturally be the most satisfactory 
method of giving a basis for this series of 
lessons. This method of approach is seldom 
practicable, however, since farms in the 
concrete vary much and often depart widely 
from the ideal ; since no one is complete ; and 
since they cannot always be easily reached. 
Some children in the class will doubtless 
have visited farms and can contribute to the 
class discussion the impressions they have 
received of a dairy farm, a truck farm, or a 
stock farm.
-P-A-G-E-103
  FIRST GRADE WORK 91 
B. Season. 
1. The work should be begun in October or early 
November, in time to finish the series by 
Thanksgiving and give a meaning to the 
celebration of that festival. 
C. Outline of a lesson. 
1. A first lesson, meeting the child’s experience 
and finding out what he knows. 
Show an apple. Ask where it probably came 
from. Trace back, step by step, as far as 
the child can go, to the market, the farm, 
the tree. At each step ask children if they 
have seen a market, an apple tree, etc., and 
have them tell you what they know about 
it. Have pictures of an apple tree in fruit, 
of apple blossoms in color, of a ladder, 
a basket, and someone picking apples. 
Prints or rough sketches made by teacher 
on board with colored crayons are helpful. 
Cut open an apple, notice the seeds. Ask 
what they are good for. Recall experi- 
ences with seeds in the school garden. Ask 
children what they suppose these would 
grow into if they were planted. Plant 
some in a pot of earth and see if they will 
grow. 
Various activities may be carried on in con- 
nection with this lesson on the apple. 
Teacher may ask children to make up 
stories about the pictures she has shown 
them. . Or the children may act out scenes  
-P-A-G-E-104
92 
  SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
from the story of the apple from planting 
the tree to picking the ripe apples. They 
may draw pictures illustrating parts of the 
life story which they have really seen. 
They may see which can cut the best 
picture of an apple from paper or model 
the best one in clay. (These activities 
will be carried on as language work, seat 
work, drawing or manual work.) 
2, An excursion to the market. 
The excursion should be followed by a dis- 
cussion of the various objects and activities 
noticed and by working out the same 
in dramatic » play, drawing, cutting, clay 
modeling, ete. Vegetables and fruit or 
pictures of them may be used in the 
classroom to strengthen the impressions 
gained. The discussion should bring out 
how these vegetables, fruits, etc., look 
when they are growing. Teacher or chil- 
dren may illustrate by drawing tree, vine, 
or bush, as they look when growing. 
3. An excursion to the farm, noting hayfields, 
cornfields with pumpkins, nut trees, brook, 
pond, sheep, ducks, ete. 
Work out as before. 
4. A study of grains. 
a. Wheat. 
Trace the story of a piece of bread to the 
wheat field. Show wheat stalks in head, 
grains of wheat, flowers, and pictures of 
wheat fields. 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  FIRST GRADE WORK 93 
Let children make flour by pounding 
grains of wheat with a mortar and 
pestle and sifting through a sieve. 
Let children chew wheat seeds. 
Show pictures of farmer preparing soil to 
plant wheat. Then let children at sand 
table plow with a stick, rake and harrow 
with their fingers, and make believe 
plant, relating all their previous observa- 
tions and experience on the subject. 
Let them lay out fields, build stick fences, 
grow fields of wheat with sticks, cut, 
rake, gather in sheaves, tie, stack, cart 
with cardboard wagon and horse to a 
paper barn, etc. 
b. Corn. 
This lesson should be conducted similarly 
to the preceding lesson. Corn stalks, 
corn in the ear, grains of corn, corn meal, 
and pictures of cornfields may be brought 
into the classroom. 
5. Farm animals. 
a. The cow. 
Start with a bottle of milk. Ask questions, 
such as — 
Where did it come from? 
Where did the milkman get it? 
Where did the farmer get it? 
Dramatize the activities of the milkman at 
the sand table with block houses, toy 
horse and wagon, toy bottles, and paper 
dolls.
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 - SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
Show toy cow and pictures of cows, taking 
care about size impressions for children 
who have not seen cows. Churn real 
butter in a quart jar and make cheese. 
b. The sheep and wool. 
Begin with child’s new, warm, winter coat, 
another’s skating cap or mittens which 
you hold in your hand and test by touch. 
Teach children to distinguish wool from 
other materials, by touch, when blind- 
folded. 
Associate picture of sheep with those seen 
in the park. 
Recite ‘‘ Baa, Baa, Black Sheep” and 
“Little Bo-peep.” Dramatize these 
rhymes. Make the noises that sheep 
make. 
Feel specimens of new wool. Twist raw 
wool into a thread. Ravel goods woven 
from coarse woolen thread. Begin exer- 
cises in weaving. 
c. The horse. 
How it helps the farmer and others. 
’ How it is cared for. 
An excursion to the blacksmith shop. 
6. Sand table construction. 
Build up a codperative farm on the sand 
table, letting children suggest all the objects 
and do all the work. Teacher guides with 
questions to keep all in congruity. <A sys- 
tematic way to begin is with a long road 
leading out into the country where the  
-P-A-G-E-107
FIRST GRADE WORK 95 
  farmer lives, putting it through the middle 
of the sand table. Then children can work 
all around the table on either side, laying 
out, one by one, the farmer’s house, barn, 
chicken coop, pigpen, duck pond, garden, 
orchard, fields, ete. Toy trees, paper dolls, 
sticks, beads, toy and cardboard animals, 
wagons, etc., made by the children as con- 
struction work previously, will add interest 
and reality to the scene when completed, 
and the representation will give the chil- 
dren a connected and unified idea of scat- 
tered bits of experience and information. 
This scene is not yet enough, for the children 
now want to play out farm activities on 
this little farm, feed the chickens and ani- 
mals, take them to the brook to drink, milk 
the cow, turn her out to pasture, put her 
in shelter for the night, plant and harvest 
fields, pick apples, gather vegetables, drive 
the wagon to the town and about the fields 
on various errands. Through this play 
they will enter more fully into the spirit of 
farm life than through hearing about it. 
7. Stories about farm life and those which em- 
phasize the tying together of a series of 
activities in an interdependent relationship, 
as— 
“The House That Jack Built.” 
“The Old Woman and Her Pig.” 
George Washington, the Virginia Planter. 
Thomas Jefferson’s Merino Sheep.

SECOND GRADE WORK 
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE WORK OF 
GRADE II 
In the work of the first year the child’s appreciation 
of his parents and other members of the family has deep- 
Results ened because he has been made conscious of 
Sai how much they help him. He has learned 
Work that each occupation has a definite relation to 
Summa- himself and that his own family could not 
tized supply his needs without help from others. 
The interdependence is felt by him, and his appreciation 
of what “ working together ” means has been intensified 
in his daily experiences in the classroom and on the 
playground. His own knowledge of pet animals, his 
experience in the school garden, his knowledge of what 
is done on a farm and what we get from a farm, lead 
him to see that human beings are dependent in many 
ways on vegetation and on animals, wild and tame. 
His “self ’’ has expanded. His known world is larger. 
He feels much more at home, since he can appreciate 
what the conspicuous elements in his surroundings are 
“good for’ and that he is an important helper in com- 
munity life. 
His emotional life has had many opportunities to ex- 
press itself in helping to celebrate the birthdays of school- 
mates, and the holidays of the nation, and in trying 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
SECOND GRADE WORK 99 
to put himself in another’s place and become the person 
whose action he tries to interpret. At one time it was 
an Eskimo baby, or an Eskimo mother, at another it 
was a farmer, or a shoemaker, or a motorman. In each 
case, he has expanded and enlarged his own emotional 
life and has learned how to appreciate sympathetically 
people unlike himself. To try to show how a grief- 
stricken mother feels, or how she sings a lullaby, or rocks 
the cradle, how the Indians dance to express their joy, 
how a command or a hospitable invitation is given, or 
an entreaty is made, has helped the child to gain concep- 
tion of mood, of motive, of cause and effect, and made 
them stand out in relative proportion. Such experiences 
illuminate much that will help later in controlling his 
imagination according to fixed principles. To control 
the imagination is a prerequisite to any serious study 
of history, for the student of history must approach 
sympathetically the past that he has never seen if he 
hopes to get a picture of it that is real and true. If he 
wants to relate to others what he has made real to him- 
self, he must be able to portray vividly and make his 
account both attractive and pleasing as well as true to 
the period of time and place in which the events occurred. 
The fairy tale may ignore dates, escape laws, delight in 
the improbable, and even record the impossible. The 
historic tale, no matter how interesting, how full of 
movement and life, can be neither improbable nor im- 
‘possible. Every item in it must be tested and verified. 
Consequently each step that the child makes toward 
controlled imagination is a decided gain as a basis for 
future history study. 
The aim in the second year’s work is to see that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
100 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
children gain definite notions of how progress toward 
Aim inthe better ways of living is made possible. All 
Work of | work in the second year must still appeal to the 
Grade! combined energy of heart, head, and hand in 
order to develop the child’s own personality and at the 
same time increase his social serviceableness. One of 
the easiest ways of bringing about such a result is to 
introduce him to primitive man and his environment and 
the problems which confront him. 
The contrast between the conditions under which 
primitive man lived and those under which the child is 
The now living is so great that the child sees a dif- 
Study of ference at once. In making comparisons, he is 
Primitive constantly using the experience gained by last 
fogs year’s work. He gradually begins to realize 
the Con. that inventions are a response to meet the 
ception of needs of society, and since the manner of living 
Progress in the time of primitive man was so simple in 
character the old way of solving such a problem as getting 
food and the new way of performing the same task after 
the invention was made are both within the child’s com 
prehension. Gain or progress can be appreciated anc 
its consequences felt. For example, the bow and arrow 
or the weighted spear bring advantages to the inventor 
that a child can comprehend. So does the discovery of 
how to make fire and how to keep fire. He can be led 
to appreciate why a cave is a more desirable home than 
a tree top. Every activity of primitive man selected 
for instruction appeals strongly to the child because he 
is interested in how food is obtained, how it is prepared, 
how shelter is secured, and how the dwellings and the 
clothing are made.  
-P-A-G-E-113
  SECOND GRADE WORK 101 
The crudeness of it all is a challenge to his own inven- 
tive powers and stimulates him to try to make awls, 
hammers, throwing sticks, bows and arrows, @ ke a 
and baskets, as primitive man made them. Rgasis for 
He is more than willing to go on an exploring History 
expedition to find nuts, berries, and roots that 
are good to eat. In these outdoor excursions he 
is getting valuable experience in regard to his own natural 
environment and laying a foundation that will make 
him a more intelligent student of both history and geog- 
raphy. He is prepared to see that the inventor of a 
new tool, or the discoverer of a new process that makes 
life easier for. these people, would be a hero. Only the 
capable man, the alert and the persevering man, could 
find out the better process, discover the clue to a situ- 
ation that was puzzling, improve an old tool or make a 
new one; consequently this power calls forth admiration 
from the others. The benefits received make the tribe 
or clan grateful, and so the hero would receive both the 
honor and the glory that every hero deserves. 
The child can also be led to see that even in these early 
tribes of human beings the sick were given food, the 
swiftest did the hunting, and the less active (3) Asa 
gathered fruit or nuts. There was some ex- Means to 
change of work, some codperation, some di- eae 
vision of labor. When these people learned Cogpera- 
to cultivate plants and to domesticate animals, tion 
they were overcoming, conquering, and controlling their 
environment. Each advance step in gaining control of 
nature meant an onward step in progress. Men must 
have been more intelligent than the brute beasts by which 
they were surrounded or they could never have discovered 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
the way to do these things, but no matter how intelligent 
they were, if they had not agreed “ to work together ” 
they could not have conquered nature. Men in organized 
society can do such things, but no man acting in isolation 
could achieve any such result, no matter how great his . 
mental capacity. It is only by combinations of united 
effort that natural resources can be controlled so that 
protection from danger, the care for the helpless or the 
weak, the acquisition of food and shelter may be se- 
cured. To-day we have soldiers and farmers, carpenters 
and blacksmiths, people who make houses and _ people 
who make hats, people who make pins and people who 
paint pictures. As a rule man becomes strong in 
proportion to the strength of the associations which he 
forms. No man in isolation has ever yet reached his 
highest development, and great progress is possible only” 
in an organized community or nation. A highly civilized 
state is not only difficult to gain, but it is difficult to re- 
tain. 
The following elementary stages by which civilization 
is reached can be made fairly intelligible to second-grade 
children : 
1. The early leaders must have been men of great 
courage and bodily vigor so as to resist the attacks 
Sacsate of enemies whether human or brute. They 
Progress must have been inventive: to find the best 
Toward hunting grounds, devise the best ways of 
Civiliza- —_ killing game, and secure abundant supplies of 
Hon food; to fashion tools and domestic utensils; 
to choose the sites for villages and make the clearings ; 
to undertake the domestication of animals and the 
cultivation of plants.

. Communication with other communities probably 
shortened the time required to secure the bare 
necessities of food, shelter, and clothing. 
. Protection of life and property for the common or 
general good of the whole community had to be 
secured. 
. When some men could procure the necessary food, 
shelter, and clothing for their families, and have 
leisure for reflection and study and were willing to 
devote their acquisition of knowledge to the general 
welfare, the progress was more rapid. 
. Men were enabled to have more leisure in the 
following ways: 
Progress in the improvement of tools. 
The change of motor power from man to beast. 
Making the wind and the running water do what 
man once did. 
. The discovery of how to use and to keep and to 
make fire not only gave control over animals, on 
account of their fear of fire, but improved the con- 
ditions of living in many other ways which young 
children can appreciate. 
At the close of the year the child ought to have gained 
considerable insight as to how progress takes place, what 
promotes it, and what retards it.

A TRUE STORY BRIEFLY TOLD TO SHOW THE NEED 
OF FIREMEN 
A small village in northern New Jersey had no fire depart- 
ment. The people said, ‘We don’t need any firemen. Our 
houses never get on fire. Who ever saw a fire in this town?” 
Only a few days later everybody in that town saw a fire. Nor 
will anyone who saw it ever forget it. This is how it happened.
-P-A-G-E-125
  SECOND GRADE WORK 113 
One Sunday morning in the windy month of March a long oil 
train was climbing a steep grade on a mountain side above the 
village. There were sixty carloads of oil. One engine was pull- 
ing the train, and another engine in the rear was pushing it 
up the hill. When the last oil car reached the very top of 
the hill, the engine in the rear cut loose because it was no 
longer needed. Surely one engine could take the train down 
the grade easily. One engine had taken it down again and 
again. 
But this time something unusual happened. A coupling 
snapped between car thirty-seven and car thirty-eight. The 
engine and thirty-seven cars were going down the hill chased 
by twenty-three cars without any engine. There were twenty- 
three cars running away on a down grade of a mountain side and 
every car filled with oil. The engineer did not know what had 
happened. A brakeman saw the coupling break and tried to 
signal the conductor. In his excitement he gave the wrong 
signal. The signal given was to stop. The engineer had the 
brakes applied, and the front train halted just at the village. 
Then the people of the village heard a crash followed by a 
shattering blast. Four oil cars were smashed. Oil was gush- 
ing forth in streams. Then an explosion with a noise that 
sounded like a cannon shot was heard. Burning oil came down 
on the fields, on the trees, on the house tops. A large fire 
column shot up into the air. It was fed by the oil flowing toward 
it. Steams of fire rolled down the hill into the village. Whole 
torrents of blazing oil fifteen feet high swept right through the 
streets of the village. Houses burst into flame quite as rapidly 
as electric lights appear in a village at nightfall. The warehouse 
was burned. All the buildings across the tracks burned. Then 
the hardware store, a carpenter’s shop, and a hotel; then two 
other stores and a restaurant, were all burning at once. The 
fences were burning. The trees were burning. The poor 
people were in a pitiable condition with no trained fire fighters

until the trained firemen from two neighboring cities came to 
help the unfortunate village. No community is really safe 
unless it has men trained to fight fire.

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEMEZ PLATEAU, NEW 
MEXICO 
The greater part of the plateau is occupied by the Jemez forest 
reserve. Six Indian reservations or grants border or lie partly within 
its limits. This region was the seat of a considerable population in 
prehistoric times, and innumerable ruins of the civilization are found 
throughout the plateau. The habitations are cliff dwellings and 
pueblos. Buried under the débris of buildings and in the graves of 
the dead are various artifacts of stone, bone, wood, fiber, and clay, 
displaying the simple industries and domestic life of the inhabitants. 
These, together with ceremonial objects, the symbolic ornamentation 
of domestic and mortuary pottery, yield important data relative to 
the social and religious life of the time. A few illustrations of these 
artifacts are found in plates XII, XIII, XIV, and XV of Bulletin 32, 
Bureau of American Ethnology. Food bowls have been preserved to: — 
us through the symbolic act of placing food with the dead. The ab- 
original potters had considerable knowledge of colors and handled them 
with good effect in decoration. Yellow and gray ware was decorated 
with black lines, plate XV. Red ware was decorated with black and 
red lines and with a salt glaze, see Bulletin, plate XV, e, f, h. Certain 
symbolic motives are very persistent, see Bulletin, plate XV, a, 6, d.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF A DAY IN BERLIN 
[The teacher should place pictures of the following subjects 
within range of the pupils’ vision two or three days before this 
lesson is given: 
A linden tree. 
The Brandenburg Gate. 
A section of the principal street, Unter den Linden. 
One of the beautiful open squares. 
The street cleaners. 
The Imperial Castle, or Schloss. 
She should have on her desk also a copy of the volume “Berlin” 
in the ‘Peeps at Great: Cities” series. This volume contains
-P-A-G-E-166
    
154 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
good colored plates. As the seacher shows each picture she 
should describe what it represents, explaining why it is of inter- 
est to us.] 
If we enter Berlin from the west and go through this gate, 
which the Germans call the Brandenburger Thor (show the 
picture), we shall find ourselves in the chief street of the city. 
It is called Unter den Linden (show the picture). There are 
no holes in the pavement, not even a crack anywhere; neither 
is there any rubbish in sight. The pavement is as clean as a 
well-kept kitchen floor. On either side of this main roadway 
(point out the roadway) on which we are driving, are these other 
roads for the people on horseback, and still other roads for people 
who choose to walk. (Point out and trace each.) Remember, 
all these roadways taken together form the street called Unter 
den Linden. There is plenty of room for’ everybody, for Unter 
den Linden is 196 feet, or almost 12 rods, wide. (How wide is 
this room measured in feet? In rods? Then Unter den Lin- 
den is how many times the width of this room?) This center 
roadway (trace again) on which we are driving is 70 feet wide. 
(Compare again with a known width.) 
There are seventy open squares in Berlin similar to this one. 
(Show picture of one of them.) Some people are walking, some 
are driving, and others are sitting on the benches enjoying the 
flowers and the fountains. Little children are playing in many 
of the squares. From these squares we can see beautiful streets, 
lined with trees, shrubs, and carefully trimmed grass, leading out 
in every direction. We may drive on these streets for twelve 
or fifteen miles into the suburbs. The drive creeps around 
the edges of lakes and extends far into the forests. 
On our outward trip, and on our return by another route, we 
can listen to delightful music and can see scores of statues of 
German heroes. Everybody in Germany understands music. 
Almost everybody can sing and play on some musical instrument. 
Some of the statues we pass are monuments to great composers
-P-A-G-E-167
  THIRD GRADE WORK 155 
of music. (Germany is the land of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, 
Haydn, Handel, Mozart, Wagner, and scores of others too 
numerous to mention.) We are certain to hear good music 
while eating our luncheon, and we shall listen to it again at din- 
ner in the evening. The Germans feel that everybody, children 
as well as people who are grown up, has a right to hear good 
music and to see good pictures. (Do you know anybody who 
has gone to Germany to study music? Many Americans do 
go there for that purpose.) 
We pass the art galleries and museums on our drive. These 
are the buildings to which the school children make excursions 
in the winter (you can find pictures of them in this portfolio). 
In this picture we see boys and girls and men and women, 
on roller skates going to luncheon. (Use the copy of “Berlin” 
on the desk. Show pictures from this volume of ‘Peeps at 
Great Cities.’’) 
The homes, with a few exceptions, are not imposing. Most 
of the people in Berlin live in comfortable “flats.” The house- 
keeping in the homes is as excellent as the city housekeeping. 
It takes careful, constant work, and able leaders to keep a 
city so clean. Painstaking care and skillful planning are neces- 
sary to make a city so beautiful. The Germans are willing to 
take the trouble to plan well, to work hard, and to spend the 
necessary money to make their cities clean, wholesome, beauti- 
ful, and attractive places in which to live. 
These are the men who take such good care of the streets of 
Berlin (show pictures of street cleaners in uniform). Some 
of these men have served their country as soldiers. When a 
man is no longer needed in the army he may help to take care of 
these beautiful streets in Berlin, or he may serve as a policeman, 
but he will have to pass examinations first. Not every man 
who has once been a soldier can be trusted in the street-cleaning 
department, for the people of Berlin are careful to select only 
the best men for such work. Their privileges and their duties  
-P-A-G-E-168
156 SOCIALIZING 'THE CHILD 
  are printed so that there can be no misunderstanding about 
what is to be done. The city will not allow them to smoke 
when on duty. If they serve the city a long time they receive 
an honorary gift. If they are sick the city takes care of them. 
They must wear uniforms. Sometimes boys may be permitted 
to assist the men in some of the work. 
The chief commissioner or supervisor of the street-cleaning 
department is a very able man. He must know the best way of 
caring for the streets. He is proud of his work and proud of 
the men who work under his leadership. He knows that Ger- 
many has the best kept, the cleanest, and most orderly cities in 
the world, and he is enthusiastic about Berlin’s share of that 
glory. 
Before taking up these problems, the teacher should read to the 
class from “Berlin’’ in the series ‘Peeps at Great Cities’? and 
should give each child a chance to look at the colored illustra- 
tions. They will be especially interested in the beautiful parks 
with their lakes which in winter are turned into skating rinks 
on which people can skate for miles and miles. She should also 
read to them or have them read for themselves from such stories 
as “Fritz in Germany,” “Louise” from “Seven Little Sisters 
who lived on the Round Ball that Floats in the Air” and 
“Louise” from “Each and All.” 
PROBLEMS 
1. Study of the street Unter den Linden. 
a. Notice the arrangement of the trees; the 
shrubbery; the flowers. Which road- 
way is the widest ? 
b. Represent Unter den Linden on the sand 
table. 
c. Measure the width of the street in front of 
the school building. Find out how many
-P-A-G-E-169
  THIRD GRADE WORK 157 
such streets could be placed side by side 
in the street called Unter den Linden. 
Which is the widest street in this city? 
(Or in the nearest city if the children 
have seen it.) How many such streets 
could be placed side by side in Unter 
den Linden? Have you ever seen the 
street called Fifth Avenue in New York 
City? How wide is it? Have you ever 
seen Pennsylvania Avenue in Washing- 
ton, D. C.? How wide is it? (Teacher 
can easily procure pictures of these streets 
andshow them.) Have youever seen any 
city street that is as wide as Unter den 
Linden? Have you ever seen a city 
street planned with such care? Have 
you ever seen a city gate? 
2. Picture Study. 
a. Find and paste in your scrapbook pictures 
that help to tell you how the city of 
Berlin looks. Write the name under 
each picture. 
b. Find pictures that show how German boys 
and girls look when going to school. 
Select pictures that show how the 
schoolrooms in Germany look. Paste 
them in your scrapbook. 
c. Find pictures of the streets of Berlin at 
Christmas time and paste them in your 
scrapbook. 
d. Name a list of toys that you have seen 
which were made in Germany. What

else do we get from Germany? Write 
both lists in your book. 
e. How could we go from here to Berlin? 
Name the various kinds of conveyances 
by land and water. Get pictures of 
these conveyances and paste them in 
your scrapbook to show how to take 
the trip. 
3. Contrast the street-cleaning department in 
our city with the street-cleaning ,depart- 
ment in Berlin. 
a. In Berlin only able men specially trained 
for the work can help manage the clean- 
ing of the streets, and the man who 
supervises them likes his work and is 
proud of his men. Who has charge of 
our streets? Have we a street com- 
missioner? Wave you seen the men 
cleaning the streets? Are they trained 
for their work? Do street cleaners in 
our cities wear uniforms? (Show pic- 
tures of street cleaners of New York City, 
or of other places, in uniform.) 
b. In Berlin the men who clean the streets 
are divided into four groups. Each 
group has an inspector, and then there 
is a head inspector over all. Each 
section of the city has its street-cleaning 
depots with yards attached in which 
the brooms, shovels, uniforms, vehicles, 
and all tools and articles are kept when 
not in use. They also have a machine
-P-A-G-E-171
THIRD GRADE WORK 159 
  shop in which tools can be repaired, or 
from which new ones may be obtained. 
Do we have inspectors? Do they have 
to pass an examination to see if they are 
fit to do the work? Do the same men 
work in all parts of the city, or is one 
section assigned to one group of men, 
and another section to another group? 
Have you seen the men sweeping the 
streets? What did they do with the 
sweepings? Have you seen men col- 
lecting garbage? Where do they take 
it? What is done with it? Have you 
seen men collecting ashes? Where are 
the ashes taken and what is done with 
them? Have you ever seen people 
removing snow from the business section 
of the city? Why is it necessary to do 
so in some cities? Have you ever seen 
waste paper, or banana or orange peel 
in our streets? Have we baskets in 
which to place the waste that collects? 
To what are they fastened? Where are 
they located? Where are the brooms 
kept? Do they look like the brooms 
used in the house? Have you ever 
seen a street sprinkler? Why do we 
have them? Do the sweepers sprinkle 
a street before they sweep it? Do we 
wash our streets? They wash the streets 
in Berlin regularly. 
c. In Berlin the boys who assist get 2 marks
-P-A-G-E-172
SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
  (a mark is a piece of money worth a 
little less than 25 cents), or about 50 
cents, a day for the first two years. 
The third-year they get 2} marks and 
the fifth year, 3 marksa day. The fore- 
man in Berlin receives 43 marks a day 
for the first three years. This is in- 
creased the fourth year to 5 marks a 
day, which is the highest pay he ever 
receives. The men who work under 
the foremen get 33 marks a day for the 
first three years, and thereafter 4 marks 
a day. The entire force is paid every 
two weeks. When are our men paid? 
How much do they receive a day? 
What does our foreman get? How 
many hours a day do our men work? 
4. Have you ever heard of people who sort 
street rubbish after it is disinfected, to 
get. 
Rags, 
Paper, 
Old shoes, ete. 
Have you ever heard of garbage incin- : 
erators? What use do we make of them 
in our large cities? Have you ever seen 
dead animals removed from the streets? 
Where are they taken? Are they good for 
anything? 
5. What can the people who live in a city do to 
help the street-cleaning department and 
to improve the appearance of the streets ?
-P-A-G-E-173
  THIRD GRADE WORK 161 
a. They can help to lessen the cost of collect- 
ing by putting each form of waste col- 
lected in the homes into the kind of 
receptacle recommended. 
What kinds of waste may be put with the 
ashes? Into which receptacle do we 
put waste paper? Potato parings? 
b. They can help to lessen the cost by putting 
waste paper, or peanut shells, or banana 
peel, or candy boxes in the street re- 
ceptacles prepared for them, instead of 
dropping them in the street. 
c. They can have competitions. to see who 
can make the most beautiful balconies, 
backyards, and schoolyards. 
6. What can the people who live in a city do to 
help those who try to keep the parks and 
playgrounds clean and beautiful?

put in place to form an outer wall. In 
the daytime the front of the house is 
always open. 
e. The partitions, or inner walls, are formed 
by screens reaching from floor to ceiling. 
Grooves in the ceiling and floor run both 
lengthwise and crosswise. Into these 
grooves the screens are fitted forming 
rooms of any desired dimensions ; or the 
partitions may all be removed if com- 
fort requires, or some may be removed 
and others left in place. 
f. The furniture is always simple. Mats 
(two inches thick) serve for chairs in 
the daytime, and also for beds at night. 
Low stools and trays serve for tables. 
Wooden headrests are used in place of 
pillows. 
g. The materials used in the houses of the 
better classes may be more costly and 
more carefully selected than the mate- 
rials used by the poorer classes; e.g. — 
Posts and ceilings may be of ebony in- 
laid with gold. ‘ 
Floors may be of rare polished woods. 
The screens which separate the rooms 
may be painted beautifully. 
The wall picture or panel painted on silk 
is called a kakemono. In the better 
homes great pains are always taken to 
have the kakemono in perfect keeping 
with its surroundings.

  2. Surroundings. 
The house faces a court, and the best room 
overlooks a beautiful garden. The en- 
trance from the street is opposite the rear 
wall usually. 
3. The ‘honorable recess.” 
An alcove in the best room of the house is the 
portion of the home in which the most 
beautiful things are kept. In this “ hon- 
orable recess’ the treasures are changed 
from time to time. Those not in use, 
whether vases, or paintings, etc., are kept 
out in the garden in a fireproof building 
which is made of cement usually, and 
painted black, with the owner’s crest in 
white on the top. It is called a “ go- 
down.” 
4. The Kitchen. 
A small metal vessel like a brazier filled with 
charcoal is the usual form of stove. A 
large, rough jar nearly filled with water, 
into which the fragments of burning char- 
coal are dropped when the fire is no longer 
needed, saves the charcoal and is a pre- 
caution against fire. There is also a jar 
as large as a barrel to hold the drinking 
water and numerous jugs to hold sauce, 
vinegar, wine, ete. Stout bowls with rough 
bottoms are used for graters; shallow 
earthen pans are used for parching corn 
and peas. Convenient cupboards with slid- 
ing doors contain the dishes.

baby calls on all the friends who sent 
“spotted dogs’ and offers each a bag 
of candy purchased in the temple court 
as a return present. 
At home that same evening there is an 
- entertainment to which only intimate 
friends and relatives are invited. 
On that same day all presents received 
during the first’ month of the child’s life 
must be acknowledged by a return gift

7. The philologists tell us that there are no 
“swear words ” in the Japanese language. 
Query: 
What can we learn from the Japanese? 
What can they learn from us? 
PROBLEMS 
1. Make a list of articles which we use, and which you 
have seen, that are made in Japan. (If children are near 
any of our largest cities or the Pacific Coast, the list will 
be long; but even in country districts the fan and the 
cup and saucer are known.) 
2. Take the children to a museum, a Japanese store, 
or the Japanese department of any large store to see the 
beautiful workmanship of the Japanese. Collect samples 
of Japanese silk, crépe, and paper. , 
3. Have you seen any Japanese men? Have you seen 
any Japanese women? Are there many Japanese living 
in our country? In which portion of the country do most 
of them live?

4, Are we as courteous in our treatment of them as they 
are in their treatment of Americans who live in their 
country? 
5. Do you know any Americans who have traveled in 
Japan, or who have lived there for some time? Why do 
Americans go to Japan? Why do Japanese come here? 
6. Show Japanese flags. 
7. Contrast their holidays with ours.

times two or three children herd their 
cows together and when the herds do 
not need their attention roast new pota- 
toes in a bonfire, study the ways of

HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY TO CHIL- 
DREN IN THE THIRD GRADE 
TuE aim is to indicate ways and means of carrying 
out the ideas of the Committee of Eight; to show how 
Aim of this ‘(Group A.— Heroes of Other Times” (see 
Section. | Report of Committee of Hight, pages 9 and 10) 
may be made real to children. Naturally the teacher 
asks, ‘‘Why should I teach these stories? How can I 
adapt them te children of this grade? Where can I get 
additional material? What pictures will be helpful?” 
To help answer such questions the material below is 
given. 
THE STORY OF JOSEPH 
The story of Joseph has all the best elements of stories 
of adventure. It is one of the most beautiful stories in 
Reasons _-2l literature. It has also an important place 
for Select- in history, because Joseph is a link between 
ing this the children of Israel and the Empire of Egypt. 
Bor: In the background of the story we have glimpses 
of wandering shepherd life, trading caravans, and palace 
life in Egypt. The story emphasizes the beauty of hon- 
orable conduct and the ugliness of dishonorable acts. 
The center of interest is Joseph, who makes a vivid im- 
pression on all with whom he comes in contact. The 
dreams, five in all, bring in an element of mystery which 
198
-P-A-G-E-211
  
HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 199 
   gradually becomes clear as the dreams are fulfilled. A 
climax is found when, among the very men who once 
united to enslave their brother Joseph, one is now found 
willing to be a slave in order to deliver their brother 
Benjamin. Beyond all other interests with which the 
story is replete is that of the providential over-ruling of 
human events. Through a series of misadventures 
which called out all that was manly and strong and tender 
in his nature, Joseph ripened into a most worthy and 
dignified character. He was a combination of grace 
and power. Combined in him were the highest qualities 
of his ancestors. He had Abraham’s dignity and ca- 
pacity, Isaac’s purity and self-devotion, Jacob’s clever- 
ness and tenacity. From his mother’s family he inherited 
cheerfulness and aptitude in management, as well as 
personal beauty. 
Every obstacle was placed in his path, yet every one 
“was surmounted. When only a boy in his teens he was 
taken to a strange country whose language he could not 
speak and sold as a slave. He had no knowledge of any 
trade that could make his services of great value. He 
‘was cast into prison because of an unjust accusation. 
But even in prison he was promoted, because of his per- 
sonal worth and finally, because of his power to interpret 
Pharaoh’s dreams, he was not only given his freedom 
but was made the ruler of Egypt. Great power did not 
spoil him. He rendered beautiful service in every posi- 
tion and not only saved his father’s family from starva- 
tion, but forgave his brethren. : 
The account as it is written in Genesis is too long to 
tell to children of the third grade. It can easily be 
divided into several units.

HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 201 
In using these pictures make clear to the children the 
difference between photographs of real things, such as 
a palace in Egypt, or a caravan, and the pictures that 
show how different artists imagined the scenes. To drive 
home the latter truth it might be well to show different 
pictures of the same scene. Point out that no Bible 
picture is real. They are all imaginative. Pictures 
that show action are attractive to primary children. 
It is the vividness of action that appeals to children 
first. 
1. Read carefully Chapters 37, 39-50 in Genesis. Get 
the whole story clearly in mind. Picture to yourself 
the environment of Joseph in Egypt during the 
successive changes in his fortunes. Refer to roan 
Kent for the time of Joseph’s life in Egypt. Prepara- 
Refer to Breasted’s “Egyptian History and _ tion for 
Art”’ to get an idea of the advanced civilization eon ee 
there as contrasted with the semibarbarous : 
conditions of the shepherd life in Palestine out of which 
he had come. 
2. Note the prevalent attitude of confidence in dreams 
and their fulfillment in Palestine and Egypt. In the 
elaborate civilization of Egypt the interpretation of 
dreams was a recognized profession. Official magicians 
and interpreters were connected with the court. 
3. In regard to the historical accuracy of the stories, 
it is well to keep in mind that these stories were told and 
retold for centuries before they were put into written 
form. Consequently they are likely to be colored by 
retelling as well as by the desire of the writer to glorify 
this ancestor of the Hebrew people. 
4, Get a vivid picture of the famines of the East;  
-P-A-G-E-214
202 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
  what caused them; the terrible effects of famine. (See 
article on famine in the eleventh edition of ‘“ Encyclopedia 
Britannica ’”’ and note additional references.) 
No one type of presentation can be best for every class. 
Choose that which most commends itself to you after 
Presenta. Careful study of the material. Make a back- 
tion of the ground for the stories by contrasting in a simple, 
sisi concrete way the richness of Egyptian civiliza- 
tion with the simplicity of patriarchal life in Palestine. 
Don’t try to teach all that you know about the subject. 
Let the wealth of your knowledge give weight to the 
little you do tell. Get from the children by questioning 
all that they know concerning Joseph before telling the 
stories. This will enable you to graft the unknown on 
the known and will secure an expectant, active attention 
on the part of the children for what is coming. Don’t 
moralize. The stories are filled with morals in the con- 
crete. Tell the stories well, and the children will see 
for themselves the wickedness of the older brothers and 
the noble conduct of Joseph. Let them express their 
views freely, but do not impose your views upon them. 
Tell the story of Joseph in the language of the Scripture 
as much as possible, because it is source material and is 
so well adapted to most young minds. It will be neces- 
sary to omit much to meet the needs of your class. The 
second and third stories below (‘‘ Joseph Sold by his 
Brethren,” and “Joseph a Slave in Egypt”) show how 
this may be done. 
It is possible to retell these stories in modern English. 
James Baldwin has done so in an admirable way in the 
book mentioned under the list of reference books for 
teachers. The advantage of such stories is that they

lessen the difficulties on the part of some children to’ 
whose ears the language of the Old Testament offers great 
difficulty, partly because of the antiquity of the litera- 
ture itself, partly because of the retention of the English 
of a former age in its translation. An inexperienced 
teacher will not retell the stories as well as Baldwin 
perhaps, but if she understands the story herself and the 
needs of her children, she can do far more for them’ 
because she is present in person. Most teachers can tell 
stories far better than they themselves realize. The 
children teach them how, for a teacher learns from a child’s 
questions what he needs to know, and the child is her 
best teacher of method. The first story below, “ Joseph, 
the Dreamer,” is a sample of what a teacher can do in 
retelling a story in modern English. 
JOSEPH, THE DREAMER 
A long, long time ago there lived in Hebron at the foot of a 
grassy hill a rich man who owned hundreds and hundreds of 
sheep and droves of cattle, camels, and donkeys. In his youth 
he had been called Jacob, but in his later years, because of 
his great possessions, people called him Israel, whieh means 
“The Prince.” 
. Now Israel had twelve sons. Ten of them were bearded 
men, tall and strong, who worked in the fields all day long. 
The youngest, named Benjamin, was a mere babe. But it 
was the next to the youngest, a boy in his teens named Joseph, 
whom his father loved more than all the rest of his children. 
The Bible tells us that he made for this son a coat of many 
colors more beautiful than the coats his brothers wore. But 
the older brothers hated Joseph because of the great love that 
his father showed for him and seldom spoke kindly to him. 
They hated Joseph the more because he was so different from
-P-A-G-E-217
  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 205 
them. He was a quiet, thoughtful boy and he had strange 
dreams that they could not understand. 
One day, all the sons except Benjamin went into the corn 
fields to cut the ripe, yellow corn. All the morning they worked 
cutting down the corn stalks and binding them into sheaves. 
It was hot in the middle of the day, and they were tired, so 
after dinner they lay down to sleep. But Joseph could not go 
to sleep at once. He was wondering what he would do when 
he was a grown man. With half-closed eyes he gazed at the 
sheaves of corn shining in the sun. There were twelve of them, 
eleven big ones and one little one. ‘Those are like my broth- 
ers,” he thought, ‘the little one is Benjamin’s sheaf, and the 
one away off from the others is mine.” Then he grew sleepy 
as he lay in the heat and looked at the sheaves, and it seemed 
to him that they began to move. His sheaf stood straight up 
and all the others formed around it. Then each of the other 
sheaves bowed and fell down to the ground before it. 
When the brothers awoke, Joseph told them what he had 
dreamed, how his sheaf stood upright and their sheaves stood 
round about and bowed before it. This angered the brothers 
and they cried, “Shalt thou indeed reign over us?” And they 
hated him more than ever. 
Another day when Israel and his sons were sitting in the 
shade of the tent, Joseph said, ‘Behold I have dreamed that 
I was a bright star in the sky and that the sun and the moon 
and eleven stars bowed down and fell on their faces before me.” 
Then his father reproved him saying, ““What mean these 
dreams that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and 
thy brothers worship thee upon the earth?” 
After this the brothers hated Joseph the more and they nick~ 
named him “the Dreamer.’ But the father thought of these 
dreams many times and wondered if the old prophecy that 
kings should come out of his family would not really come 
true.
-P-A-G-E-218

JOSEPH SOLD BY HIS BRETHREN 
Joseph’s brethren had gone to Shechem to feed their father’s 
flocks. One day Israel said to Joseph: “Thy brethren feed 
the sheep in Shechem; come, I will send thee to them.” And 
when Joseph answered, ‘‘I am ready,” his father said to him, 
“Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the 
cattle, and bring me word again.” So Joseph was sent from 
the vale of Hebron and came to Shechem. And a certain 
man found him there wandering in the fields and asked him what 
he sought. Joseph answered, “I seek my brethren; tell me 
where they feed the flocks.” And the man said to him, ‘‘They 
are departed from this place, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go 
to Dothan.’”” : 
So Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan. 
When the brethren saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, 
they planned to kill him, and said one to another: “Behold 
the dreamer cometh. Come, let us kill him, and cast him into 
some pit, and we will say, ‘Some evil beast hath devoured him’ ; 
and then we shall see what will become of his dreams.” And 
Reuben, hearing this, said, “‘Do not take his life nor shed his 
blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and 
lay no hand upon him.” Reuben said this, being desirous to 
deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his 
father. 
As soon as Joseph came to his brethren, they stript him of 
his outside coat, the coat that was of many colors, and cast 
him into an old pit, where there was no water. And sitting 
down to eat bread, they saw some Ishmaelites coming from 
Gilead, with their camels, carrying spices and balm and myrrh 
to Egypt. And Judah said to his brethren, “What will it 
profit us to kill our brother and conceal his blood? It is 
better that he be sold to the Ishmaelites, and that our hands 
be not defiled, for he is our brother and our flesh.”’ His brethren 
agreed to his words. And when the merchants passed by,
-P-A-G-E-219
  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 207 
they drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites 
for twenty pieces of silver; and they led him into Egypt. 
And Reuben returning to the pit found not the boy, and 
rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: ‘‘The 
boy is not in the pit. Whither shall I go?” 
And they took Joseph’s coat, and, having dipped it in the 
blood of a kid which they had killed, they sent someone to 
carry it to their father, and to say: ‘This we found; see 
whether it be thy son’s coat, or not.” And the father acknowl- 
edging it said: “It is my son’s coat, an evil wild beast hath 
devoured him.’”’ And tearing his garments he put on sackcloth, 
mourning for his son a long time. All his children gathered 
together to comfort their father in his sorrow. He would 
not be comforted, but continued weeping and said: “TI will 
mourn until I see my son again.” 
JOSEPH, A SLAVE IN EGYPT 
Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian, 
an officer of Pharaoh’s and chief captain of the army, bought 
him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him thither. The 
Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man in all 
things. He dwelt in the house of his master, the Egyptian, 
who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all 
that he did to prosper in his hand. So Joseph found favor in 
the sight of his master and ministered to him, and, being set 
over all, he governed the house committed to him and all 
things that were placed under his care. The Lord blessed the 
house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake, and multiplied all 
his substance both at home and in the field, and Potiphar left 
all that he had in Joseph’s hands. 
Now Potiphar’s wife was a wicked woman, and she accused 
Joseph of things of which he was not guilty and caused him to 
be thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were kept. 
But the Lord was with Joseph and gave him favor in the sight
-P-A-G-E-220
208 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
of the chief keeper of the prison. All the other prisoners were 
placed under his care, and nothing was done in the place except 
as Joseph ordered it. Yet he was not allowed to set foot out- 
side of the prison doors. 
After this it came to pass that two officers, the butler and 
the baker of the king of Egypt, offended the king, and he sent 
them to the prison of Potiphar where Joseph was. The keeper 
of the prison delivered them to Joseph. And it came to pass 
that both the butler and the baker dreamed a dream the same 
night. When Joseph saw them sad in the morning, he asked 
them saying, ““Why is your countenance so sad to-day?” 
They answered him saying, ‘We have dreamed a dream, and 
there is no one to interpret it to us.” And Joseph said to them, 
“Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you 
have dreamed.” 
(Read or tell, the remainder of Chapter 40 to the 
children, Verses 9 to 23 inclusive, also Chapter 41 de- 
scribing Pharaoh’s dreams, Verses 1 to 36 inclusive. 
Then condense the remainder of the chapter as below.) 
  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Thou shalt be over my: 
house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people 
shall obey; only in the kingly throne will I be above thee. I 
have appointed thee ruler over the whole land of Egypt.” 
Then he took a signet ring from his own hand and put it upon 
Joseph’s hand, put upon him a robe of silk and a chain of gold 
about his neck. And he made Joseph go up into his second 
chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee 
before him, for he was now the master of the land of the Nile. 
Self-expression on the part of the children is as neces- 
sary in the third grade as in the two preceding grades. 
A third grade child must still learn through doing in 
order to understand.

The latter relates the wanderings of Ulysses after the 
close of the Trojan War. These tales are not true to 
the literal history of the Greeks. They are probably 
based on legends of a still earlier age, and are idealized 
representations of Greek history. They are full of great 
heroic action and vividly portray primitive ways of 
living in the early stages of civilization. They are 
simple in both thought and expression and make a strong 
appeal to children in the third grade. 
The Odyssey should be read and reread and realized 
as far as possible by the teacher. She should be saturated 
with the heroic spirit with which the stories are filled 
before she attempts to retell them to the children. A 
good translation of the Odyssey for the teacher’s use is 
“The Odyssey in English Prose” translated by Professor 
S. H. Butcher and Andrew Lang (abridged edition pub- 
lished by The Macmillan Company, 1914). The trans- 
lators are noted for literary skill and sound scholarship. 
They have omitted repetitions and some portions un- 
suited to the needs of children. 
A knowledge of the Iliad is necessary to appreciate 
some portions of the Odyssey. ‘‘The Story of Ulysses” 
by M. Clarke given in teachers’ references by the Com- 
mittee of Eight presents good introductory sketches of 
the city of Troy, the ‘Judgment of Paris,” the ‘‘Abduc- 
tion of Helen,” the ‘‘Oath of the Suitors,’’ and a brief 
description of Greek gods. It also contains a good 
map of Greece for teachers’ use. The book is well 
illustrated. 
The teacher should keep as near as possible to the 
original form in retelling the story, for epic poetry belongs

They feed the child’s healthy love of adventure, Sty: 
and stimulate his imagination. Ulysses is the Greek 
manly ideal of shrewdness and wisdom. The stories 
are filled with reverence for the unseen powers, with 
deeds of charity, and mutual helpfulness, love of honor, 
love of truth, and last but not least a steadfast love of 
country and family which draws the wanderer home 
through many perils. Ulysses is brave but cautious, 
fond of adventures but prudent, clever, and crafty. 
The character of the whole Greek race is summed up in 
this heroic figure. The oldest ideals of the Greeks are 
found in these stories. 
THE STORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
Review carefully the long antagonism between the 
Greeks and the Orient. In prehistoric times the feeling 
emerges in the form of myth. The stories of Rae 
the search for the “Golden Fleece” and the prepara 
songs about Troy portray it. The valor of tion for 
the Greeks idealized in literature tended to Telling 
intensify the antagonism between them. The ‘Stores. 
whole plan and conception of the history of the Persian 
wars by Herodotus, the first Greek historian, is based 
on a recognition of the antithesis between the Orient rep- 
resented by Persia and the Occident represented by Hellas.

  212 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
Although the Greek’s idea of patriotism did not go 
much beyond his own city, he leaned toward democracy 
in government and gloried in the individual right of 
initiative. To his mind the gods were the chief citizens 
of the state. To be associated with them was a privilege. 
To show them respect, to entertain them with feasts and 
games was fitting and proper. To show them disrespect 
was treason. 
The Greek lived face to face with nature and in his 
naturalness and freshness he was a child of nature. The 
Greek gods lived in nature and revealed themselves 
to men through its activities: e.g. winds, thunder, light- 
ning, changes of seasons. The Greek admired a well- 
developed body, personal beauty, triumphs of wit, of 
craft, and of strength. He was thoroughly worldly. 
The Oriental, on the other hand, knew no privilege 
except to bow in resignation before the unexplained man- 
dates of fate. His conception of the state was a vast 
despotism. He looked with disapproval amounting al- 
most to disdain upon the physical universe and all that 
belonged to it, including the human body. He dwelt 
more in the inner world than in the outer. Endurance 
and submission were characteristic of the spirit of the 
Orient. 
Alexander considered himself a second Achilles. His 
earliest ambition was to be the champion of Hellas 
against the Orient. He shared the Greek enthusiasms 
for current politics, marvelous stories of returned com- 
missioners and foreign ambassadors, reports of victorious 
generals, new plans for fleets and for docks. The policies 
of statesmen and the tricks of politicians were well known 
to him.

Few personalities have done so much to change the 
trend of history. When Alexander’s career began the 
culture of the world was fixed in two main types: one in 
the river valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt; the other 
in the Greek city communities. All that these cities 
had accomplished in art, in philosophy, in science, and 
in developing the democratic state before Alexander’s 
day was known as “‘Hellenism.” He scattered or spread 
this Hellenism wherever he went. When his career 
closed, the barriers separating the two main types of 
culture had been broken down, never to be raised again. 
Alexander planted seventy cities of the Greek type 
on Oriental soil. Eighteen of them were named for him- 
self, and one for his famous horse Bucephalus. 
European civilization as we know it had its origin in 
a union of the Oriental and the Greek culture. The 
inner life of Christianity is of the Orient, but its philo- 
sophical organization is Greek. Little by little the old 
local idea of citizenship held by the Greeks slowly de- 
veloped into a sense of citizenship of the world. Then 
cosmopolitanism was born. 
Some great historians have seen nothing more in the 
career of Alexander than a brilliant disturber of the 
world’s order. To their minds he enthroned 4), 
militarism, annihilated Greek liberty, and prac- ander’s 
tically destroyed all that makes Greek life of Place in 
interest to the world. Demosthenes, a contem- Mistry: 
porary of Alexander, considered him an agent of de- 
struction. Niebuhr and Grote, able nineteenth century 
historians, saw in Alexander only a mad opportunist 
and a greedy conqueror. In the twentieth century the 
biography of Alexander by Benjamin Ide Wheeler, in
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
the “Heroes of the Nation” series (published by G. P. 
Putnam’s Sons), represents a different view. Edward 
Meyer agrees with Wheeler’s views. (See his article in 
the International Review for December, 1903.) Both 
writers claim that Alexander was an idealist. They 
claim that he was great as.a man, and great as a conqueror. 
Wheeler’s excellent maps of the campaigns and his criti- 
val comment upon the untrustworthiness of some familiar 
anecdotes concerning Alexander the Great are of exceeding 
value to the teacher. 
In the ‘‘Anabasis of Alexander” written by Flavius 
Arrianus in the second century after Christ, we have a 
summary of what Alexander and his father, King Philip, 
accomplished for the Macedonians. The account is 
said to be a portion of a speech given by Alexander when 
the Macedonians under him were jealous of his generosity 
to Orientals and had threatened to desert him. <A por- 
tion of the speech follows : 
“My father, Philip, found you poor and vagabond, 
clad in skins, feeding a few sheep on the mountain sides, 
and fighting to protect these from neighboring Thracians 
and Illyrians. He gave you the soldier’s cape to replace 
the skins, settled you in cities, gave you laws and manners, 
made you masters instead of slaves of the barbarians 
about you, added Thrace to Macedonia, opened for you 
the mines and the harbors of the sea. He made you 
the rulers of those very Thessalians before whom you 
had lately shrunk with deadly awe. He humbled the 
Phocians, and gave you entrance into Greece by a broad 
highway. Instead of your paying tribute to the Athe- 
nians and obeying the Thebans, these states now look to 
us as arbiters of their weal. . . .

was clear and white with ruddy hue on cheek and breast. 
His eyes were blue and deep-set and his brows heavy. 
Massy golden locks rose up mane-like from above the 
center of his forehead. A strong, finely-shaped nose 
(almost aquiline) joined high to the forehead, sensitive, 
passionate lips, and a prominent chin complete the pic-

accounts agree that he was beautiful to look upon. He 
had a habit of carrying his head slightly inclined toward

in him at the highest tension. In his actions we see 
the philosophic, self-contained Alexander standing out 
in relief against the natural Alexander. Plutarch says, 
“Alexander taught the Hyrcanians to live in wedlock, 
and the Arachosians to till the fields; the Sogdianians 
he induced to support their fathers instead of killing them, 
the Persians to honor their mothers instead of wedding

It is in this period between 330 and 325 B.c. that Alex- 
ander’s purpose seems to change. He began his career 
as the champion of Greece against the Orient, and con- 
sidered himself the leader of the Greeks against the 
Persians until the battle of Issus. Thereafter, some 
historians claim that he considered himself the successor 
of Darius upon the Persian throne. All agree that he 
wore Persian dress, adopted the ceremonies of the Per- 
sian court, and compelled his generals to prostrate them- 
selves before him according to Persian usage. In the 
years 330 B.c. to 325 B.c. his aim seems to have been to 
mingle the races of men under his power into one ‘‘true 
world empire.” He married the beautiful Roxana, 
a princess of Bactria, whose father he had conquered. 
He also encouraged his Greek and Macedonian officers 
and soldiers to take Persian wives in order to promote 
good feeling among the two races.

the terrors of famine, thirst, and disease. 
An impression of Alexander’s military genius can be 
gained from this summarized view of his conquests. When 
he was only thirty years of age he had already faced the

Illyrians and Thracians on their mountain sides, the 
Beeotian phalanx on the plains of Thebes, the Persian 
cavalry at the Granicus. He had scaled the 4), 
walls of Tyre and humbled the impregnable ander’s 
fortresses of Gaza. He had scattered the as- Military 
sembled hosts of Western Asia at Arbela (Gau- ee 
gamela). But this did not close his military career. 
He passed on to India and came into conflict with an 
utterly new, strange people, who combined in their re- 
sources not only wealth and courage but organization 
and an advanced acquaintance with the art of war. No 
other great general in the world’s history was ever exposed 
to such a variety of tests, and yet he is the only one who 
never lost a battle. Military critics claim that in clever- 
ness of plan and brilliant execution the battle with Porus 
at the Hydaspes was Alexander’s masterpiece. The 
army of Porus was almost annihilated. The chariots 
were shattered, their drivers killed. Eighty war ele-

sons of King Porus were among the slain. 
Historians and biographers differ in their judgments of 
Alexander’s intentions. It is difficult to know what his 
real purposes were. But his acts had great pocutts of 
results. Of the seventy cities founded by him, atex- 
some were in Egypt, some in Tartary, and some ander’s 
even as far distant as India. He distributed Cmses's- 
among his subjects vast treasures that had been uselessly 
hoarded in the chests of the Persian king. He stimu- 
lated Greek scholars to study the plants, the animals, 
and the geography of Asia. He prepared the peoples 
of the Orient to receive the language and customs of the 
Greeks,

  Alexander united under one master all the ancient 
world from the Adriatic to the Indus, from Egypt to 
the Caucasus. Greek became the common tongue in 
the Eastern Mediterranean countries. This fact greatly 
helped the spread of Christianity, for in the time of 
Christ a man could travel from Spain to Northern India 
and exchange ideas with other men. Greek philosophic 
teachings spread into Syria and Palestine. The minds 
of the Greeks were broadened. They ceased to feel that 
they were a select people, better than any foreign people. 
This new spirit of cosmopolitanism, or the common 
brotherhood of all, supplanted gradually the narrower 
provincialism. The time from Alexander’s death to the 
conquest of the Greek kingdom by Rome is called the 
“Hellenistic Period” or the ‘‘ Alexandrian Age.”

can be done in the third grade is to arouse a vital interest 
in the man Alexander so that a desire to read and learn 
more about him will be stimulated. The degree of the 
teacher’s success will depend largely upon her famil- 
iarity with the hero in his setting. Some sample stories 
for children of the third grade follow. In telling the 
stories, report Alexander’s actions. What did Alexander 
do? is the question that should be answered. Avoid 
telling what kind of man he was. What he did will 
show what he was, if well told. The great secret in 
story-telling is to be full of the subject. Unless the 
teacher has tried to climb the mountains, and bridge 
the rivers, and cross the deserts. with Alexander, and 
has traced his routes, sympathized with his aims, and 
appreciated his difficulties as well as his ambitions, she 
will not have the rich background that will enable her 
to see the hero and to make others see him. Unless his 
achievements touch her she will not move others in de- 
scribing them. Each story told. must be sufficiently 
concrete and detailed to enable the child to gain an actual 
mental picture of the events or actions described. 
ALEXANDER’S BOYHOOD 
The first six years of his life Alexander was under the care 
of his nurse, Lanice. He loved her as most boys love their 
mother. (Proteas, one of her sons, was one of Alexander’s 
most intimate associates. All her sons gave their lives for 
him in battle. Her only brother, Clitus, was the faithful 
friend who saved Alexander’s life at Granicus.) Alexander 
grew up in the company of other children in the women’s 
quarter of the house. He had the usual toys, e.g. tops, hoops, 
puppets, and a riding horse. He often listened to cradle songs 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
and nurse’s tales. He seldom saw men, — not even his own 
father, Philip, because he was a king and was busy with wars. 
At seven years of age, Leonidas, one of his mother’s relatives 
who became tutor to the young prince, taught him how to 
develop his muscles, trained him to endure hardships and priva- 
tions, and to abhor luxury. Lysimachus, who was his personal 
attendant, remained with him even when he had grown to 
manhood. 
Once in his father’s absence a body of special ambassadors 
came from Persia to the capital. Little Alexander proceeded 
to entertain them. He showed them distinguished attentions 
and kindness quite unusual for a mere child. Then he began 
to question them about their country. ‘What sort of a man 
is your king? How does.he treat his enemies? Why is Persia 
so strong? Has she much gold? How large is her army? 
What kind of roads have you? How long are they? How do 
you travel in the inland parts of the country?” The Persians 
gazed at him in wonder and said to one prothes, “Philip is 
nothing compared to that boy.” 
After his thirteenth year, his father felt that ordinary teach- 
ers would never do for so remarkable a boy, so he employed 
Aristotle, the most famous philosopher of the day, to instruct 
Alexander. Aristotle was in the habit of walking about with 
his pupils while he was teaching them; so, for a schoolroom 
King Philip provided a large garden with seats of stone and 
cool, shady paths. There Alexander read old plays and his- 
tories and Homer. He loved Achilles best of all the Homeric 
heroes. His mother often told him he was descended from 
Achilles the hero of the Iliad. When he was large enough to 
read the Iliad for himself, he used to call it the soldier’s Bible. 
He knew most of it by heart and often, even when he was a 
man and a great general, he used to sleep with it under his 
pillow. *

THE TAMING OF BUCEPHALUS 
(As a boy, Alexander was restless, energetic, fearless, intelli- 
gent, inventive, and independent. The story of the taming 
of Bucephalus is considered authentic and shows these qualities 
in a form that children can appreciate. The boy was about 
twelve or thirteen years old when the incident occurred. The 
story follows as Plutarch tells it, with a few omissions.) 
“Philonicus of Thessaly had offered to sell Philip his horse, 
Bucephalus, for thirteen talents. So they all went down to 
the plain to try the animal. He proved, however, to be balky 
and quite useless. He would let no one mount him, and vio- 
lently resisted every attempt of Philip’s attendants who tried 
to make him obey. Philip, in his disgust, ordered the horse 
led away, as being utterly wild and untrained.... Alex- 
ander, who was present, said, ‘That is too good a horse for those 
men to spoil that way, simply because they haven’t the skill 
or the grit to handle him right.’ His father said, ‘What do 
you mean by criticising your elders, as if you were wiser than 
they, or knew so much more about handling a horse than 
they do?’ 
““Well, this horse, anyway, I would handle better than any- 
one else, if they would give me a chance.’ 
“Tn case you don’t succeed,’ said the father, ‘what penalty 
are you willing to pay ... ?’ 
“<P Il pay the price of the horse!’ 
“ Laughter greeted this answer... . Alexander went straight 
to the horse, took him by the bridle, and turned him around 
toward the sun. This he did because he had noticed that the 
horse’s fright was due to his own shadow dancing up and down 
on the ground before him. Now he ran beside the horse, pat- 
ting and coaxing him, until he observed’ that the horse was 
impatient to go. Then he quietly slipped off his cloak, swung 
himself up, and sat securely astride the horse guiding him about 
for a while with the reins. He neither jerked at the bit ner
-P-A-G-E-236
    224 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
struck the animal but let him prance and gallop as much as 
he would until his excitement wore itself out. Then he turned 
the horse about and galloped up to the group of men with pride 
and joy in his face, for the horse was now under his control. 
The men had watched in silence at first, fearful of the outcome. 
Now they burst forth in loud cheers. His father, who had been 
anxious about him, shed tears of joy as he dismounted. Then, 
kissing him on the forehead,’ he said, ‘My son, seek another 
kingdom suited to your powers. Macedonia is not worthy of 
you.” 
ALEXANDER’S TREATMENT OF BUCEPHALUS 
Bucephalus became the inseparable companion of Alexander 
from that day. He went with him on all his campaigns, shar- 
ing many toils and dangers. Alexander nearly always rode 
him in battle. No one else was ever allowed to mount him. 
Bucephalus was a magnificent black horse of extraordinary 
size. He was marked with a white spot on his forehead. Some 
say his name was given him because of this resemblance of his 
head to that of an ox. Others say he was branded with the 
mark of an ox head. 
Alexander’s affection for the animal is illustrated by two 
stories, one told by Arrian, the other by both Plutarch and 
Arrian. Arrian’s story is this: 
“This horse once disappeared in the country of the Uxians 
(a tribe of robbers east of Mesopotamia) whereupon Alexander 
sent out a proclamation throughout the country stating that, 
if they did not bring back his horse, all the Uxians would be 
“put to death. In response to this proclamation the horse 
was brought back immediately. This shows how great was 
Alexander’s interest in the horse and also incidentally how 
great was the barbarian’s dread of Alexander.” 
Plutarch’s story : 
“Shortly after the battle with Porus (the battle of Hydaspes)
-P-A-G-E-237
  
  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 225 
Bucephalus died.... He was worn out with old age. 
Alexander was overwhelmed with grief at his loss. He felt 
as if he had lost an old companion and friend. So he founded 
a city on the Hydaspes and named it in his honor Bucephala.” 
For eighteen years this horse had been with him. He richly 
deserved the honor of having a city named for him. This city 
still exists and is now known as the city of Jalalpur. 
Examples of other anecdotes and incidents in the life 
of Alexander the Great that can be made comprehensible 
to children of the third grade are: 
1. Honors paid to those who were killed in battle. 
The provision made for their children and their aged 
parents. 
2. The presents sent to his mother and to the city of 
Athens and a former tutor. 
3. The story of the Gordian knot. 
4. Alexander’s ingenious way of protecting his soldiers 
from the wagons of the mountaineers. 
5. Alexander’s generous treatment of the family of 
Darius and his punishment. of the traitor who killed 
Darius. 
6. The story of how he surprised, Porus and produced 
confusion among the three hundred war elephants.

THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS

realize a little of the grandeur of the consequences of 
the discovery of America.

been by land. Mariners crept along the coasts or crossed

into the trackless ocean, and they found the distance so 
great, the voyage so precarious, and the returns so slight 
that the ventures were soon discontinued. It was in 
1471 when Columbus was a grown man that the first 
European ship crossed the equator and not until 1517, 
after Columbus had been in his grave eleven years, did 
the first European ship sail to the eastern coast of Asia.

the stars observed from various places. His proof had 
been accepted by nearly all the ancient philosophers. 
Seventeen hundred years before Columbus, Eratosthenes, 
a famous geographer, declared that it would be possible 
to sail from Spain to India on the same parallel were it 
not for the vast extent of the Atlantic Ocean. Some 
later writers thought that with a favoring wind the 
journey could be made in a few days. 
Learned men in the age of Columbus did not for a mo- 
ment question the rotundity of the earth. They had 
read Aristotle, Ptolemy, Mela, Strabo, and other geog- 
raphers ancient and modern. Nothing is more absurd 
than to accuse them of thinking the earth was flat. In 
the years between 1472 and 1492 six new ‘editions of 
Ptolemy’s geography were published. Some educated 
European: merchants and missionaries had traveled to 
Asia and were familiar with Asiatic seaports, but they 
naturally supposed those seaports were on the Atlantic 
ocean. Roger Bacon in 1267 suggested that a ship 
might sail-westward across the Atlantic to China and pro- 
ceeded to fortify his opinion by giving extracts from 
Aristotle and other ancient writers. Among the unedu- 
cated masses, however, the belief in the flatness of the 
earth was general. 
It was in 1492 that Martin Behaim made his famous 
globe which may still be seen in the old Town Hall of 
old Nuremberg. On this globe fully two thirds of 
Hindustan is omitted, and in place of it is a Ceylon 
magnified tenfold.

terranean ports for at least two thousand years before

in the century between 1250 and 1350 many Europeans, 
chiefly merchants and Franciscan monks, visited China. 
They learned through personal experience that China 
was a maritime country. 
Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant, lived in the service 
of the Mongol emperor twenty-five years. In 1299, 
Marco after his return to Europe, he wrote down his

the greatest book of travel ever written. It introduced 
Europeans to Japan as well as to Chinese seaports. 
Marco Polo described Japan as an island kingdom out 
in the ocean east of China, and called it Cipango. Many 
of the things related by him were considered unbelievable 
by his contemporaries but we now know that most of 
them were really true. 
Pierre d’Ailly, archbishop of Cambrai, in 1410 wrote

his ‘General History and Geography,” records that 
both the torrid and the frigid zones are uninhabitable. 
Columbus read all these books diligently and wrote 
commentaries in Latin in the margins. The Columbian 
Library at Seville contains the copy of ‘‘The Image of

the World” which was read by Columbus. The marginal 
notes in Latin written by him show that he did not be- 
lieve all that he read. He criticizes the geo- tndenee 
graphical traditions by the light of his own ex- of the 
perience and knowledge. One note says ‘‘The Books on 
torrid zone is not uninhabitable, because the C!™m>us- 
Portuguese sail through it; in fact it is teeming with 
people, and near the equator is his Serene Highness the 
King of Portugal’s castle of Mine, which we have seen.” 
During the last half of the fourteenth century a new 
impetus was given to navigation due to the interruption 
of European trade with the East. In 1368 the Taiteeripe 
Mongols were driven out of China and that tion of 
country was closed to foreign trade. As early European 
as 1365 the Turks had taken Adrianople dade: 
and from this time Turkish corsairs swarmed in the 
waters of the Levant to the peril of all Christian voyagers. 
The capture of Constantinople, the grand old Christian 
city, in 1453 by robber bands humiliated the Christians 
and greatly discouraged the commercial towns through- 
out Europe. The aggressions of the Turks lasted for three 
generations and in the end practically closed up the old 
trade routes. Genoa was one of the first cities to feel 
keenly the loss of her trade. Soon all Europe was deeply 
concerned, and how to find another route to the Indies was 
the question that almost every nation was trying to answer. 
Among the most enterprising of the early navigators 
were the Portuguese. Prince Henry of Portugal, xplore 
called Henry the Navigator, founded a school tions of the 
of explorers that included many illustrious Portu- 
mariners. His was a many-sided personality ; ®"°S* 
in him were combined the spirit of the missionary, the

merchant, the statesman, and the scientific inquirer. One 
of the problems of these disciples of Prince Henry of 
Portugal was to ascertain whether Africa could be cir- 
cumnavigated and a route thus found into the Indian 
Ocean. It was while suppressing Moorish piracy that 
the Portuguese captains made their first acquaintance 
with long stretches of the coast of Africa and heard of 
Guinea and its mines of gold. But when Prince Henry 
died in 1460 the way to India around Africa had not 
yet been found, and it was destined to be many years 
before the Indies should be reached by this route. Prince 
Henry had lived, however, to see his voyagers sail waters 
that had been deemed inaccessible and to see the African 
coast explored to within fifteen degrees of the equator ; he 
had lived to give a great impulse to maritime enterprise. 
And now people began to ask the question, ‘Is there 
no other way to India?” Columbus answered that

navigator of that age had made so protracted a study of 
all available sources of information in regard to any spe.

He had read widely ; he had engaged in the business of 
making maps and globes; and he had been a daring navi- 
gator. During his residence in Portugal he had sailed 
in Portuguese ships to Guinea and north as far as the 
British Isles, and in 1477 had participated in an expedi- 
tion to Iceland. While in Portugal he married Phillipa 
Moniz who is said to have been the daughter of Bartho- 
lomé Perestrello, one of Prince Henry’s navigators.

Two men, Las Casas and Ferdinand Columbus, claim 
that the idea of sailing west to reach Asia was suggested 
to Columbus by the letters of a Florentine physician 
and astronomer, Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli. 
The king of Portugal in 1474 had asked Toscanelli 
if he could suggest a new route to the East Indies. In 
his reply to this letter the famous astronomer suggested 
steering westward across the Atlantic, and sent the king 
a map which explained his views clearly. When Colum- 
bus asked Toscanelli the same question, the astronomer’s 
reply was full of enthusiasm. He sent him a duplicate 
of the map which he had formerly sent the king of Portu- 
gal and urged Columbus to undertake the voyage. Ad- 
mitting the genuineness of the Toscanelli letter, we know 
that Columbus had previously accumulated in the marked 
passages of his own books a far more convincing body 
of facts than anything in Toscanelli’s letter. No evi- 
dence or facts are supplied in the letter which were not 
already familiar to Columbus. However, the letter may 
have encouraged him and directed his attention to the 
solution of the problem. 
All students of the subject agreed that the earth was 
asphere. The question at issue was the probable length 
of the voyage necessary to reach China or Japan Feasibility 
by sailing due west. Both Toscanelli and Co- of the Pro- 
lumbus were wrong in their estimates of the cir- posed 
cumference of the earth. Because Columbus 7!" 
thought the earth much smaller than it is there was no 
doubt in his mind as to the commercial advantage of 
braving the unknown terrors of the voyage across the 
Atlantic. This was the scheme that he urged upon his 
fellow-men for eighteen or twenty years. He hoped

courage to carry out a voyage in search of land to the

fifteenth century. In 1492 he rendered the world the 
greatest service possible. He alone was willing to give 
up some of the best years of his life to test the theory 
held by learned men. His deed has made him immortal. 
In so far as a free sea sets the spirit free, he was the 
liberator of the human race. By trusting his ship to 
the open sea he carried mankind along in his wake. His 
first voyage opened the gates of the ocean and thus 
brought all parts of the world into communication. The 
invincible courage which made him persevere through 
years of scorn and insult in devotion to an idea, calls 
forth our admiration. It is a poor service to the truth 
of history to attribute to Columbus virtues which he 
did not possess, as some writers have done. Nor is it 
just to blame him because he had not the virtues of Las 
Casas, nor the scientific knowledge of a Copernicus. 
No human being reaches the highest excellence in all 
respects. His wonderful achievement needs not the 
embellishment of fiction. The man is great when painted 
in his real colors. No other man ever faced chances of 
fortune more extreme or left posterity under greater 
obligations. He deserves to be honored for what he 
was and for what he did.

ters to keep out the cold with small openings which let in the 
light through oiled linen or paper. On the lower floor was 
the shop where the weaving was done with long counters in 
front on which the goods were displayed and sold to customers. 
The family lived over the shop. 
Genoa was a seaport and to its wharves came ships from 
China, and Japan and India, or the Indies, as people called 
these eastern countries. Like many other of the lads of Genoa, 
Columbus liked to play on the wharves and to watch the 
swarthy seamen unloading their precious cargoes of beautiful 
silks, fragrant spices, and rare gem: 
great sails were pulled up and down 
steered, and he listened to thrilling 
adventurous seamen who had sailed s. He learned how the 
and how the ships were 
stories from the lips of 
into seas that ships had 
never entered before, and had discovered new lands. And 
stirring tales these mariners must have had to tell — of sea 
fights with pirate ships (for these were the days of pirates), of 
mutinies, of wrecks, of all kinds of hair-breadth escapes. 
As Columbus grew older he longed to sail with these seamen 
on their long voyages to distant countries. He read many 
books of travel, among them the book of Marco Polo, a book 
more thrilling than any fairy tale.

his book, one reads of courtiers dressed in robes of silk studded 
with sapphires and rubies, and of palaces with panels of silver 
and gold and roofs of pure gold. 
At last, the day dreams of Columbus’s boyhood turned into 
realities, and he became a sailor, seeing lands that until then 
had been to him only names, takin, 
periencing for himself the perils of part in sea fights, and ex- 
ife on the sea, of which he 
had heard so many tales. For several years he lived in Portu- 
gal, and while there he may have sailed with Portuguese mari- 
ners on their long voyages of discovery down the coast of Africa

— always hoping to round the tip of this great continent and 
to open up a waterway to the Indies. 
This was the question that all Europe was asking, “How 
can we find a new way to the Indies?”’ The old route, part 
way by sea and part way overland by caravans across Asia, 
could no longer be traveled in safety, since enemies had cap- 
tured one of the chief cities along the way. Columbus saw 
ship after ship come back to Portugal after their long voyages 
to Africa without having solved the mystery of how far that 
great unexplored continent stretched to the southward, and 
he began to ask himself, ‘Is there not some other waterway to 
the Indies that men have not yet thought of?” 
Now in the time in which Columbus lived, only a small part 
of the world as we know it had been discovered. The people 
of Europe had no more idea that away over here across the 
Atlantic were two great continents than had the savage tribes 
who lived here an idea of the existence of the land of the white 
men. Many ignorant people thought that the earth was flat 
and that if one journeyed too far in any direction one would 
fall off. There were all kinds of stories told of the frightful 
monsters that lived in the Atlantic Ocean waiting to devour 
those who ventured too far on its waters. 
But Columbus believed, as did many other educated men, 
that the world was not flat but round. And since he thought 
the world to be much smaller than it really is, he decided that 
one could sail westward out across the Atlantic right around 
the world to China and Japan. So sure was he that the riches 
of the East could be reached by sailing west that he was will- 
ing to brave the perils and uncertainties of a voyage into un- 
known waters whose length no man could foretell. 
But Columbus was too poor to pay the cost of such an expedi- 
tion. He needed large ships, money to pay the sailors, and 
supplies of food to last many weeks or perhaps many months. 
He wanted a powerful king to help him carry out his plans. 
For years the Portuguese king had been helping great mariners

So he went to King John II of Por 
“Tf the earth is round like a ball,

But King John was not in the 
rewards. Then, too, he preferred 
men who had been carefully train abit of giving such high 
his own Portuguese sea- 
ed, for Columbus was a 
stranger to the King and might not be as able as he seemed. 
So Columbus left Portugal disappo

d Queen of Spain. A long 
war was being waged with the Moors, and the court was con- 
stantly being moved about from place to place. King Ferdi- 
nand was in the thick of the fighting as city after city of the 
Moors was besieged, and Queen Isabella was busy sending 
supplies to the armies, relieving the sufferings of the people 
and even riding into the camp sometimes on horseback to 
encourage the soldiers. No wonder they found little time to 
listen to this stranger with his plan for sailing west in order 
to reach the East. And so from month to month and then 
from year to year they put him off, never actually refusing to 
help him, but never really taking time to think about the matter. 
For seven weary years Columbus wandered, following the 
Spanish court from place to place, far away from his home 
and family in a strange country. Sometimes great men were 
   
-P-A-G-E-253
  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 241 
kind to him and took.him into their homes. But often, he 
must have looked very shabby and had little to eat. 
At last Columbus lost hope of ever gaining the attention 
of the king and queen amidst all this tumult of war and bustle 
of court affairs. Did he intend to give up this great plan of 
his? No, indeed, Columbus was a man who never gave up. 
He decided to go to France or England and see if he could not 
get help from one of these countries. But first he must find a 
home for his little motherless boy, Diego. What a pathetic 
picture the father and son must have made as they left the 
Spanish court together, the father grown old before his time, 
gray and bent and poorly dressed; the little boy shabby; too, 
pinched and hungry-looking, very likely, big-eyed with wonder 
over the new people and places he was seeing. 
After walking until they were weary, the travelers stopped 
at the gate of a monastery and asked the porter for some bread 
and water. Some kindly fate must have guided Columbus 
to this monastery, for here he found the best friend he had 
met in all these years. He was Juan Perez, a monk who heard 
Columbus asking for bread and knew that he must be a 
foreigner by the way he spoke Spanish. Perhaps, something 
in this shabby, tired-looking stranger’s face interested the 
monk, or perhaps he was only sorry for him. He invited him 
into the monastery to rest and asked him whence he came and 
where he was going. And Columbus told him of his daring 
plan for finding a shorter way to the Indies and of the years 
he had spent at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella with no 
success. He said that as soon as he could place little Diego 
in the home of his aunt and uncle, he would go to France or 
England and try to find help there. 
As Columbus talked of this great idea that had filled his. 
mind for so many years, Juan Perez became more and more | 
interested. He decided that the plan was reasonable. So he 
wrote a letter to Queen Isabella begging her not to let Colum- 
bus leave Spain, and sent it by a trusty messenger. In the

-P-A-G-E-255
  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 243 
meantime, the stranger and his little son were to stay comfort- 
ably at the monastery. 
Now it happened that this good monk had once been Queen 
Isabella’s confessor and that the Queen had great respect for 
his opinions. In him Columbus had found a friend who would 
be worth more to him than the friendship of all the great court- 
iers combined. And so it came about that in fourteen days 
a messenger came from the Queen bringing money for Colum- 
bus and a request that he should come with Juan Perez to see 
her. Forthwith Columbus bought some new clothes to wear 
at court and a mule on which to travel and he and Juan Perez 
journeyed with light hearts to see Queen Isabella. 
Many changes had taken place at the Spanish court in this 
short time. Granada, the stronghold of the Moors, had fallen. 
Jolumbus saw the last of the Moorish kings kiss the hands of 
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and of young Prince Juan, who 
was heir to the throne. Ferdinand and Isabella were now the 
greatest rulers in Christendom. 
A council of wise men was appointed to consider the plan, 
and these men came to the decisicn that it was worth trying. 
But everything was not to run smoothly for Columbus even 
now. He asked great rewards, too great, Queen Isabella 
thought. And so, once again, Columbus turned away dis- 
couraged to go to France. But the Queen changed her mind 
and sent a messenger after him to say that he should have the 
rewards he asked for and that she would fit him out with ships 
and money and men for his great adventure. Once more, 
Columbus turned back, and after a few more-delays the papers 
were signed. Columbus was to have the title of admiral and 
was to be made viceroy over aii the lands that he should dis- 
cover. A tenth part of the gold, precious stones, pearls, silver, 
spices, and other treasures found in these lands should be his; 
and if he bore an eighth part of the expenses, he was to have 
an eighth part of the profits of all the voyages made. More 
than this, the title of Don was to be given to him and to his

family. Little Diego had a share in the honors, too. He was 
to be sent to school, and after two years he was to be page to 
Prince Juan, the son of the King and Queen. This was one 
of the greatest honors of all, for the court pages were usually 
chosen from the children of noble families. 
Now it seemed as if all Columbus’s hopes and dreams were 
at last coming true. But still af were delays and discour- 
agements. The Queen had difficulty in raising enough money 
for the undertaking. Then sailors were afraid to go on such 
an uncertain voyage. They were afraid that they might get 
to the edge of the sea and drop off; that the sea might be boil- 
ing hot in some places; that ste dragons might eat them. 
Queen Isabella even offered to give prisoners their freedom if 
they would go. And finally enough men and money were 
gathered together to fit out and man three small ships. And 
this was the fleet that started with its dauntless admiral to 
sail around the world. 
THE VOYAGE 
Just an hour before sunrise one August morning in 1492, 
three little ships, scarcely larger than the fishing smacks that 
sail up and down our coast to-day, lifted anchor in the harbor 
of Palos. There was a great crowd of people of all classes 
and all ages gathered to see them off. Some of them were 
cheering, some were silent, staring in eager curiosity, but many 
were weeping, for these little ships were the ships of Columbus’s 
fleet and they were sailing away out across the ‘‘Sea of Darkness” 
—no one knew where — and few acta ever to see them sail 
back to Spain again. 
It must have seemed like a happy dream to Columbus to 
be really embarking on this voyage to the Indies for which he 
had planned and hoped and waited during all these long years. 
But his troubles were by no means over. Probably no one 
ever did a really big thing without a great deal of hard work 
  re
-P-A-G-E-257
HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 245 
and worry and a great many discouragements. And this 
voyage of Columbus’s, which was about the biggest thing that 
a man has ever done, was beset with difficulties from start to 
finish. 
Just as the ships were well under way, it was found that the 
Pinta had a broken rudder. So it was necessary to stop for 
about three weeks at the Canary Islands for repairs. 
But the thing that made this long and dangerous voyage 
the hardest for 
Columbus was the 
faint-heartedness of 
his sailors. Now 
most of these sail- 
ors were ignorant, 
superstitious men 
who had been 
bribed to go by 
promises of gold or 
by being offered 
freedom from 
prison. They had ;

based this plan of 
sailing around the world. They thought he was a crazy 
dreamer who was leading them on a foolhardy expedition 
that could end only in all losing their lives. 
As they saw the last strip of land fade away on the horizon 
behind them, many broke down and wept and begged Colum- 
bus to give up his perilous voyage and return to Spain. When 
they had been out of sight of land many days and knew that 
there was no hope of rescue if they should get into trouble, 
they became more and more discontented. Every unexpected 
happening filled them with terror. At one time they sailed   
 
-P-A-G-E-258
246 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
through great floating masses of seaweed. Then were the 
sailors sure that dreadful demons lurked here to ensnare them 
and drag them down into the sea by entangling the ships. 
For many days the breeze blew steadily from one direction — 
a breeze that bore the ships rapidly forward. Then the sailors 
instead of welcoming the favorable wind declared, “It is some 
witchcraft that controls the very air on these unknown waters 
and causes the winds to blow always in the same direction. 
We are being carried farther away from safety into no one 
knows what fearful dangers and can never turn back again.” 
Of course the wind did change many times. But the sailors 
could always find something to worry about, just as the faint- 
hearted always can. Columbus mets the most of every en- 
couraging sign. But as a whole month went by and still no 
land was sighted, the discontent grew greater and threatened 
to break out in open rebellion. For the sailors began to gather 
together and say to each other: ‘He is only a foreigner who 
wants to be called Don. If he will not return, let us throw 
him into the sea.” 
No one knows how this bravest of expeditions might have 
ended, had it not been that about this time there began to be 
unmistakable signs of land. Fresh weeds and some fish that 
live about rocks were seen. Best of all there were found floating 
in the water a branch with red berries growing on it, which 
had been freshly broken from a tree, and a stick that had been 
carved by hand. And now, every one was eagerly watching 
the rim of the sea ahead, for a silken jacket and nearly five 
hundred dollars in money had been promised to the one who 
should be the first to see land. 
On the night of the eleventh of October, there was great 
excitement on board these three little ships. No one slept, 
for all knew that they were nearing land. About ten o’clock, 
Columbus saw a moving light as if some one were carrying a 
flaming torch. He could not tell whether the light were on 
land or in a boat on sea. It could mean but one thing — that
-P-A-G-E-259
  
HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 247 
their long search for land was almost over. At two o’clock on 
the morning of the twelfth, a gun was fired from the Pinta 
and the ery of ‘Land, ho!’’ was raised. All crowded to the 
forward decks to see if it were really true. Yes, there it was! a 
long, low mound that rose dark against the sky. What hours 
of suspense those must have been till dawn! None knew what 
wonders this little mound of land might reveal. Visions of 
the golden domes and minarets of some city of the Indies rose 
before the eyes of the sailors. They crowded around their 
Admiral, whom they had wanted to throw overboard only a 
few days before, and called him “Don” and congratulated him. 
And Columbus, the poor weaver’s son, was the happiest man 
among them. 
At daybreak, they saw a low island covered with beautiful 
tropical trees. Columbus, dressed in a robe of brightest scarlet 
and bearing the banner of Spain, embarked with his men in 
small row boats to take possession of the new-found land. As 
the boats grated on the sandy shore, the admiral and his little 
company threw themselves upon the earth and kissed it. 
Then Columbus rose and solemnly took possession of the little 
island in the name of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, 
naming it San Salvador. 
As this little company from over the seas were gathered 
here on the shore, there came from the woods dark-skinned, 
half-naked men strangely decorated with paint and feathers. 
They gathered around the strangers and wondered at the 
whiteness of their hands and faces. They thought Columbus 
and his men must have come down from heaven and that their 
white sails were great white wings. 
Columbus gave them red caps and necklaces of glass beads 
and all sorts of pretty trinkets. They were delighted with 
these gifts and went away and told others about these kind 
men who had come down from the skies. And when they came 
back they brought presents in return — bright-colored parrots, 
ornaments of gold, flowers, and fruits.

And what was this little island that Columbus had come so 
many miles to find? It was one of

was some outlying island along the coast of Asia and that not 
far away were China and Japan with all the riches and wonders 
of which he had dreamed ever since he could remember. 
EXPLORING IN THE WEST INDIES 
As soon as Columbus had taken possession of the new-found 
land, he set out with his men in the ships’ boats to cruise along 
the coast and discover, if he could, what kind of land this was 
that seemed so fair and yet had neyer seen civilized men before. 
The natives he called Indians, for he thought he had reached 
“the Indies.” He learned to talk by means of signs with these 
men whose language was so unlike any he had heard, and of all 
whom he met he asked the same question: “Where can we find 
gold?” They answered by telling him of a large island which 
they called Cuba — the very same 
name to-day. At this news, Co

  HOW TO INTRODUCE HEROES OF HISTORY 249 
The friendship of the Indians could always be won by gifts 
of pretty trinkets. In exchange they would give Columbus 
food, fresh water from the coolest springs, and gold and silver 
ornaments. One day as the voyagers were approaching a new 
island, an Indian paddled out in a canoe and wanted to be 
taken aboard. But when he came near the ship he was fright- 
ened and started to turn back. Then two of the sailors jumped 
overboard and captured him and brought him to their Admiral. 
The poor Indian was trembling with fear, and he held out as 
an offering a ball of bright-colored cotton yarn. Columbus 
greeted him kindly, put a red cap on his head, strings of green 
beads around his arms, and hung little bells on his ears. Then 
he gave back the ball of yarn and sent him on his way. 
Another day the ships overtook an Indian who had paddled 
far out from land and seemed to be too exhausted to paddle 
farther. Columbus had his men take him on board, canoe 
and all, and give him bread, honey, and wine. When night 
came they drew near an island. So they put the grateful 
Indian in his canoe and sent him ashore. During the night 
the natives came out to the ships bringing fresh spring water, 
fruits, and roots that were good to eat, for the grateful Indian 
had spread the news of the kindness of the white men. 
On one of their explorations, the sailors saw the Indians 
cooking a queer kind of root. This root was nothing less than 
the potato, and this was the first time that a white man saw 
it. They also saw Indians rolling up dry leaves into a roll, 
then lighting one end of this roll, and sucking the smoke into 
their mouths. These rolls the Indians called tobaccos. And 
they saw fields planted with corn and other fields planted. with 
cotton. Little did they dream, however, that these products 
of this new land were to be worth more to Europe than all the 
spices of the East for which they were looking. 
When the ships came to the shores of Cuba, Columbus said, 
“This must be the mainland of Asia; we are now without 
doubt approaching the realms of the Emperor of China.”
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
So he sent a messenger to seek out the great Emperor and give 
him a letter. But Louis, the messenger, came back after sev- 
eral days having found no city, no palaces, no gold — only 
villages of naked savages. 
And so the ships journeyed on from island to island, getting 
a little gold here and there and sometimes pearls and silver 
and all sorts of beautiful bird feathers and pretty trinkets. 
One day they came to the island of Hayti, and here a 
serious mishap occurred. For the Santa Maria struck a hid- 
den reef of coral and was wrecked. Columbus must have been 
almost in despair when he saw ‘he waves breaking over the 
little ship and realized that she had made her last voyage. 
What would all this long voyage across the sea profit if he could 
not get back in safety to Spain and bring word to the King and 
Queen of his discovery! But his resourcefulness did not fail 
him in this emergency. He decided to build a fort on the island 
from the wreckage of the Santa M aria and leave part of the 
crew, while he went on to Spain with the rest to get more money 
and more ships and come back again. 
And this is how the first European fort came to be built in 
this new world. Over this little fort the flag of Spain was 
raised, and it floated as proudly as if it knew that this was the 
beginning of vast dominions for the King and Queen across 
the sea.

not troubles a plenty, on the twelfth of February there came 
up a great storm that lasted for days. The two ships became 
separated, and the Nina, the smallest ship of the fleet, now strug- 
gled along by itself. Waves mountain high threatened to 
engulf the frail craft at any moment and to carry with it to 
the bottom of the sea the wonderful piece of news that Colum- 
bus was bringing to Europe. : 
But Columbus was determined that even though all on board 
should be lost, the news of his discovery should be saved if 
possible. So he wrote out a full account of the long voyage 
and the islands and the people he had found, sealed it, and 
addressed it to the King and Queen of Spain, promising a re- 
ward of one thousand ducats to him who would deliver it. 
Then he wrapped the letter in waxed cloth and put it in an 
empty barrel, which he caused to be headed and thrown into 
the sea. But lest this barrel never reach land, he prepared 
another copy in the same way and placed it in an empty cask 
on the high poop of his deck, hoping that if the vessel sank the 
cask might float off and be picked up. 
But as if by a miracle the little ship weathered the gale and 
came a few days later to the Azores. People gathered on the 
shore in crowds to see the little Nina that had come safely 
through the storm, for many strong vessels had been wrecked. 
Columbus wrote a letter to the King of Portugal asking for 
permission to enter the port of Lisbon, and a letter to the 
King and Queen of Spain telling the news of his discovery, and 
sent them by couriers. 
This time, the Genoese mariner was given a very different 
reception from the one he had received years before when, poor 
and unknown, he had come to the great King for help. He was 
invited to come to the royal palace at Valparaiso, where he was 
received with every honor as if he were a royal personage. 
On the thirteenth of March Columbus sailed for Spain, and 
two days later he entered the harbor of Palos out of which he 
had sailed more than seven months before. How glad the

The Value of Holiday Celebrations Summarized. 
1. They make the children familiar with some of the 
best traditions of the past. 
2. They help the children to secure concrete imagery 
and enable them to take the first steps toward a reverent 
appreciation of the past. 
3. The contrasts and comparisons made between various 
ways of cclebrating holidays serve to deepen the children’s 
appreciation of historical changes that mark progress. 
4. They help to develop the children’s appreciation 
of the location of historic events in time and in place. 
5. They increase the children’s admiration for heroes 
and awaken still further curiosity concerning local, 
state, and national achievements. 
6. They stimulate wholesome feeling and give the chil- 
dren an opportunity to express emotion beautifully in 
march and dance and song. 
7. They develop adequate motives for patient, careful 
work and stimulate the children’s initiative, resource- 
fulness, and perseverance. 
8. They help to give standards by which the children 
may estimate the artistic merits of other celebrations.

by summarizing the values arising from such celebra- 
tions at the close of the book the primary teacher may 
see more clearly the desired goal toward which much of 
the work in grades one, two, and three has been tending. 
In the first grade, for instance, such holidays as Thanks- 
giving Day or St: Valentine’s Day furnish the motive 
for many of the problems set for construction work. The 
interest of the children is intensified because the articles 
made are either used in decorating so as to help make 
the festive atmosphere, or are given as a present to one 
greatly beloved, or to an unfortunate person who is ill, 
or to a poor person who can not provide himself with 
the article. The fact that Thanksgiving, or Christmas, 
or St. Valentine’s Day is coming affords the children a 
most natural opportunity to serve others in their com- 
munity, and thus experience the pleasure of giving. 
In the second grade by trying to enter into the experi- 
ences of primitive man, the children see still more clearly 
than before how many things they have for which they 
ought to be grateful. The contrast between the life 
of the tree-dweller and their own sheltered lives deepens 
their appreciation of the comforts of their own lives. 
They are naturally anxious to tell or to act out the con- 
trast between primitive days and our own, as they con- 
ceive them, and will eagerly give an inventory of what 
the tree-dweller had for which he was thankful. 
The celebration of holidays is prominent in each section 
of the work mapped out for the third grade. In study- 
ing Holland from a child’s point of view the children 
learn how the feast of St. Nicholas is celebrated; in 
studying child life in Japan, the New Year’s festival is 
described im detail; in studying child life in Germany, 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
256 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
  the German way of celebrating Christmas is made promi- 
nent; in studying child life in France, the children are 
continually learning about beautiful ways of celebrating 
holidays. 
In each grade after the first there is an opportunity to 
compare or contrast two or more ways of celebrating the 
same holiday. Such comparisons and contrasts help 
to develop the children’s conception of ‘historic changes”’ 
which mark progress, and their ability to locate the 
historic celebrations in time and place. 
An eminently wise recommendation of the Com- 
mittee of Eight is that in the lower grades more atten- 
tion be given to the elation of holidays. Some of 
these, such as Columbus Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, 
New Year’s Day, Washington’s Birthday, Memorial 
Day, and Flag Day occur within the school year. In 
.some of our Southern states the birthday of Robert E. 
Lee is a legal holiday. In primary grades St. Valen- 
tine’s Day is often celebrated. Founder’s Day or days 
commemorating the oe of some local patriot 
are other occasions for celebrations. Many Northern 
states make the birthday of Lincoln a legal holiday. 
Of course no school could undertake to celebrate all 
of these days in a single year nor are they of equal im- 
portance. Some offer less difficulty than others to those! 
who are planning the work. In common practice Christ- 
mas seems to receive the most emphasis. For little 
children Thanksgiving and Washington’s Birthday present 
the greatest obstacles but these are the two especially 
recommended by the Committee of Eight. Both are 
national holidays and commemorate ideas that can be 
impressively conveyed by a suitable celebration. A | )

  THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 257 
superficial or mechanical celebration has little value. 
In order to make a holiday significant to a child, the 
music, the marches, the processions, the scenery, and the 
costumes, must be arranged so as to produce the appro- 
priate setting and atmosphere. Such work when well 
done consumes much time and requires skillful planning, 
as well as enthusiastic, persistent, painstaking effort. 
Consequently, only a few celebrations can be carried 
out in a given class, and in schools containing all the ele- 
mentary grades it would be wise to so arrange the cele- 
brations that each class could participate alternately 
as guests and as hosts. 
Thanksgiving can be celebrated in any school. Its 
educational possibilities are a sufficient reason for urg- 
ing its celebration in all grades. The custom One!

very old. The form in which the gratitude is ex- Compari- 
pressed has differed from age to age and is not 8s and 2 c Contrasts. 
identical among any two peoples of the same 
age. For instance, in the seventeenth century the Dutch 
form of celebrating Thanksgiving differed from the Eng- 
lish, and the latter differed from the celebration of Eg- 
bert’s day. The Roman Cerelia was by no means iden- 
tical with the feast given in honor of Demeter. Nor was 
the Jewish feast of the “‘Ingathering” or Feast of Taber- 
nacles with its booths, processionals, and solemn forms 
of rejoicing similar to the classic festivals of either the 
Greeks or the Romans. However, the custom of rejoic- 
ing over the harvest runs through all the earlier cele- 
brations. To return thanks for the harvest was a uni- 
versal custom. In those days famine was dreaded. 
To secure sufficient food for man and beast was a difficult
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
problem. In our day modern methods of storing and 
preserving food, modern methods of transportation and 
of production and of harvesting have lessened the possi- 
bility of famines, and greatly increased our reasons for 
gratitude. 
The teacher who will trace the history of Thanksgiving 
back to its origin among the Canaanites and follow its 
development down through the ages will be The His- é bes | a eae 
Ree repaid by gaining a deeper meaning of the signifi- 
Thanks- cance and spirit that characterize a fitting 
giving celebration of this holiday. She will learn that 
ao the celebration is by no means peculiar to 
America, and she may be led to see that repro- 
ducing the Pilgrim’s celebration is not always the most 
educative form of celebration C the children of the 
primary grades. Only since 1865 has the day been an 
annual national holiday in our country. It is the only 
religious festival celebrated in the United States by virtue 
of the authority of the civil government. When the 
thanksgiving proclamation of the President of the United 
States has been issued, the governor of each state issues 
a proclamation naming the same day as a holiday on 
which the people are to return thanks for the favors and 
blessings of the year. In New England it is considered 
the chief holiday for family reunions. 
In the book of Judges, the teacher may read: “And 
they went out into the fields, and gathered their vine- 
yards, and trode the grapes, and held festival, and went 
Hebrew into the house of their god, and did eat and 
Celebra- — drink.’’ Thanksgiving among the Hebrews was 
tions. an act of worship to Jehovah. It was called the 
“Feast of the Tabernacles” because during the festival 
   
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 259 
every one lived in booths or tents in memory of the years 
when the nation had no settled home. 
In Deuteronomy are found the following directions 
transmitted by Moses: ‘‘Thou shalt keep the feast of 
tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered 
in from thy threshing floor and from thy wine press; and 
thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and 
thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-sery- 
ant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the father- 
less, and the widow, that are within thy gates. Seven 
days shalt thou keep a feast unto the Lord thy God: 
. . . because the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all 
thine increase, and in all the work of thine hands, and 
thou shalt be altogether joyful.” 
In Leviticus the command reads, ‘‘When ye have 
gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast 
unto the Lord . . . and ye shall rejoice before the Lord 
your God seven days.” 
In the book of Nehemiah the Lord commanded, “Go 
forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches and 
branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm 
branches and branches of thick trees, to make booths. 
So the people went forth and brought them, and 
made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his 
house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house 
of God, and in the broad place of the water gate... 
and there was very great gladness.” 
It is quite evident that the Thanksgiving celebration 
was the principal festival of the Jewish year. All of 
their feasts occurred after the harvest, when their ma- 
terial blessings were not only abundant but obvious. 
The people had both the disposition and the leisure to
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
express their gratitude in suitable form, for their labor 
of crop gathering was over. 
Plutarch tells us the Jews spread tables laden with 
fruit and lived during the festival in tabernacles made of 
palm and ivy and that a few days later they kept another 
festival. In this they carried boughs of palms in their 
hands and went into the temple with them. The Le- 
vites went before with instruments of music. (For a 
modern account of the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles see 
“ Jewish Encyclopedia,” pp. 656-662, vol. XI.) 
The purpose and historic value of Thanksgiving cele- 
brations is well expressed in Scribner’s Magazine for Decem- 
ber, 1914, in a poem entitled ““A Feast of Tabernacles”’ 
written by John Finley, Commissioner of Education of the 
State of New York. A portion of the poem is quoted 
below with his permission in the hope that it may prove 
both stimulating and suggestive to teachers.

This shall ye do; seven days each year 
Ye shall forsake what ye hold dear ; 
From fields of taméd fruits and flowers, 
From love-lit homes and sky-built towers, 
From palaces and tenements 
Ye shall go forth and dwell in tents, 
In tents and booths of bough-made roofs, 
Where ye may hear the flying hoofs 
Of beasts long gone, the cries of those 
Who were your father’s forest foes, 
Or see their shadows rising fast 
Along the edges of the past ; —

Of earth-control and heav’n desire,

That ye may know the crownéd worth

meal which corresponds in a measure to our Thanksgiving 
dinner. On the first festival day the women of Athens 
went in a great procession amid mirth and rejoicing to 
the temple of Demeter on the promontory of Colids 
where they celebrated Thanksgiving. On the third day 
they fasted. Then followed a celebration in Athens for 
three days. On the first of these, or the fourth festal 
day, sacrifices were offered to Demeter. Honey, oil, 
milk, and native fruits were placed upon her altar. On 
the fifth day there was a procession of torch-bearers 
who marched from Athens to Eleusis. On the sixth, 
thousands of people, dressed in festal robes, decked with 
garlands, and carrying torches, chanted the praises of

the name of “‘ Harvest Home” back to Egbert’sday. Ina

ceremony was attached to escorting the last load to the 
barn or to cutting the last sheaf. Neighbors vied with 
each other in getting the harvest home as early as pos- 
sible. In Scotland the last sheaf gathered was called the 
“Kern.’”’ As soon as it was bound and set on end the 
reapers announced, we have ‘‘got the Kern.” Then 
an image dressed in a white frock and colored ribbons, 
crowned with heads of wheat, was hoisted on a pole. 
This was called the ‘‘kern baby” or ‘‘harvest queen.” 
They followed this in a procession to the barn where they 
sang and danced and partook of a harvest supper. 
Sometimes the last sheaf, instead of being carried on 
a pole, was placed in a fu called the ‘“‘hock-cart.” 
Musicians preceded the cart. The reapers, both men 
and women, tripped after, hand in hand, singing and 
shouting. One of the old songs has come down to us:   
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 263 
“Harvest home! harvest home! 
We've ploughed, we’ve sowed, 
We’ve reaped, we’ve mowed, 
We’ve brought home every load. 
Hip, hip, hip, harvest home!” 
In more modern times it became customary to have 
a general harvest festival for a whole parish. (See 
George Eliot’s ‘‘Adam Bede,’’ Chapter 53, for a descrip- 
tion of a Harvest Home supper.) All the farmers con- 
tributed to the supper. All the laborers attended. The 
festival commenced with a special service in the parish 
church which was suitably decorated for the occasion 
with fruit and flowers. The religious service was fol- 
lowed by a dinner in a tent or a large building, after 
which there were harvest sports. 
In addition to the annual celebration of Harvest Home, 
special days of thanksgiving were often proclaimed on 
exceptional occasions such as on the recovery of a monarch 
from a serious illness, or the discovery of the gunpowder 
plot, or the defeat of the Spanish Armada. 
The Dutch celebrated Thanksgiving on October 3d of 
each year in memory of their deliverance from the Span- 
iards. It was kept as both a religious and a cetepra- 
social holiday. The Pilgrims observed the cele- tions in 
bration of this day in Helland each year for Holland. 
ten years before they came to: America. Through the 
Pilgrims the custom of celebrating Thanksgiving was 
introduced as a ‘“‘ Harvest Home”’ in New England. 
The celebration should grow out of the daily work 
in which the: children are engaged. This means that 
the teacher must decide early in the year the general

tion. suggest what should be done and how it should 
be done. The children in the three primary grades should 
not be expected to write plays. Their method of dramatic 
work is very different from that used by adults. Primary 
children of the same age vary greatly as to their dramatic 
ability. The work of harvesting, or of making pumpkin 
pies can be acted out by them. Pantomime with or 
without music, or pantomime with some dialogue, is a 
suitable form of expression for the first grade. 
No one form of representation should be insisted upon 
in the primary grades. Nor should well-developed 
pantomime be expected. All of their representation will 
be crude. The chief aim is to have freedom in action 
and vivid portrayal. If the children are imaginative 
and free in bodily expression the pantomime will possess 
charm. Poor enunciation and weak tones, so common 
with children in the first grade, often mar the attempt 
at dialogue. Probably the most satisfactory expression 
for the Thanksgiving celebration of primary grades will 
be secured by combining speech, pantomime, march, 
dance, poem, and song. 
As a rule, pantomime needs to be accompanied by 
music to hold the parts together if the scenes to be repre- 
sented are long or require bigllnaih gesture to tell the 
complete story. Short pantomimes, where the action 
is simple, need no music, The children have had prac-

THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 265 
tice in impromptu pantomime and gesture in the class- 
room. They’can represent people at work, for instance, 
or at play. Primary children can act out husking corn, 
gathering nuts, picking apples, bringing home the grain, 
setting the Thanksgiving table, giving a party, going 
to grandmother’s to dinner, and a host of other industrial 
and play activities connected with the celebration. 
How to lead children to put their natural expression 
into a form that the listeners can understand most readily 
is a difficult problem to solve. The teacher must dis- 
cern the merit in the various fragmentary suggestions 
of the children, select the most desirable spontaneous 
expressions, and bind all into a related whole. Skillful 
guidance and a definite aim will be necessary at each 
stage. The little children have not the experience neces- 
sary to enable them to imagine the final result. No 
matter how clever, imaginative, or dramatic a group of 
children may be, much suggestion, stimulus, and direction 
on the part of the teacher will be necessary to produce a 
worthy and fitting appeal to the audience. 
Even when a teacher realizes that a particular idea is 
wholly within the range of childish emotion, and that 
a child ought to be able to express it in a fairly adequate 
way, it will often be necessary to question and present 
the situation in such a way that the child may realize 
what it demands in action. She should not dictate in 
words what he should either say or do. Nor should 
she act it out for him to imitate. She must keep con- 
stantly before the child’s mind that his action must tell 
the story to the person who does not know it. 
As far as possible, each child should have a part in the 
final performance. Of course the children best adapted

The celebration may assume many different forms. 
If the rejoicing over the harvest is to be the keynote of 
the celebration, many suggestions can be gained from 
the old Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and old English cele- 
brations. If it seems preferable to emphasize the close 
of the summer season and the approach of winter, the 
description of autumn by the poets will prove suggestive. 
If the chief aim is to commemorate the first Thanks- 
giving on the bleak New England coast, much material 
can be found in prose and verse describing that event.

to students in the upper grades. Only minor parts 
could be given to children in the primary grades. But 
the music, if well selected, will enable the primary children 
to share in the celebration and to appreciate some of 
the beauty and value in what they see and hear. Their 
appreciation will be emotional rather than intellectual, 
and will be heightened by performing some minor part. 
Music can be used to stir emotion, to create the re- 
quired mood, and as a means through which the emotions 
when aroused can find a suitable form of expression. 
Great care should be taken in the selection of the music. 
A song can sometimes render a general idea in a concrete 
form easily grasped by the listeners. Lydia Maria Child’s 
“Over the River and through the Wood” gains in mean- 
ing when children “act it out.’’ When the school as a 
whole sing the selection, the song carries them all away 
in the sleigh to grandmother’s. It serves to fix in the 
memory the local color. It locates the scene as to time 
and place. Music adds impressiveness to ceremonies 
and processions. It makes joyousness or mirth contagious 
and is perhaps the best medium to stimulate the audience 
to enter into the festive mood of the day. 
The following celebration of Thanksgiving was planned 
by the children of grades one and two under the guidance 
of their teachers. The children of the first grade planned 
to show what we should be thankful for, and to whom 
we should say ‘‘thank you.” The children of the second 
grade endeavored to make clear to the children of the first 
grade what people were thankful for in grandmother’s 
day, and long, long before grandmother’s grandmother 
came to earth. Both grades were to participate in a 
“thanksgiving feast” prepared by themselves,

The children of the third grade gain many ideas con- 
eerning the celebration of holidays in other countries

giving season they are not sufficiently familiar with any

of them to act them out in dance and song, in marches 
and processions, unless the teacher has planned in ad- 
vance to concentrate upon some particular way of cele- 
brating Thanksgiving. However, in their second grade 
work last year they learned Indian corn songs and Indian 
dances after the Thanksgiving season had passed. Now 
is the time to review this material and utilize it in the 
third grade celebration. 
In “Indian Boyhood” by Charles A. Eastman, we 
have true stories of Indian manners and customs written 
by an Indian. ‘‘Hakadah’s First Offering,” pages 101 
to 112 inclusive, gives a story that is full of interest and 
can be acted out by third grade children. The setting 
is an Indian camp with open front and fire in center. 
On one side of the fire is Uncheedah (the grandmother), 
on the other side is Wachewin, an old woman who has 
been asked to assist in the first personal offering of Ha- 
kadah (a boy of eight) to the Great Mystery. The boy 
Hakadah enters carrying in his hands a bow and arrows. 
The small birds and squirrels that he has killed with 
these weapons dangle from his belt. His dog Ohitika 
is there. 
Scene I. might be a dialogue between the boy and his 
grandmother which would disclose the character of the 
sacrifice to be made and its purpose. 
Scene II. might represent Uncheedah and Hakadah 
performing the ceremonies over the dead Ohitika by the 
use of the paints, the tobacco, and the peace pipe, and 
might close with the grandmother’s prayer to the Great 
Mystery to make the child a great warrior and hunter. 
Scene III. might represent Indian. braves returning 
from the hunt, The setting for the scene might be an 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  
THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 274 
Indian camp in which the squaws are braiding grass, 
making baskets, bead work, and moccasins. Some are 
singing lullabys to the papooses whose cradles are hung 
upon pegs. A few Indians are making bows and arrows. 
The Indian braves enter from a hunt carrying game. 
They are greeted with shouts of approbation. Then the 
men join in a hunting dance which is followed by the 
singing of a corn song. Finally the ceremony of return- 
ing thanks is begun. This includes throwing tobacco 
on the fire so that their prayers may rise with the smoke. 
To furnish a contrast and to utilize this year’s new work, 
a Hebrew thanksgiving ceremony might be the closing 
scene of the day’s celebration. 
The Hebrew thanksgiving might include a procession 
of pilgrims to attend the “ Feast of Tabernacles.”” Each 
carries a palm branch. At each end of the stage might 
be a booth made of boughs to remind them of the days 
when they had no settled homes. An altar may be 
placed in the center of the back of the stage. On this 
the offerings of fruit, oil, and grain are laid. Psalms 
of praise and thanksgiving are sung. Miriam and her 
maidens, dressed in scarlet, yellow, and white, may render 
a thanksgiving dance. (Curtain.) Some song of praise 
and thanksgiving should then be sung by the whole school. 
There are many references for Indian music and Indian 
ceremonies given at the close of the chapter dealing with 
work for second grade. Some metrical interpretations 
of Hebrew psalms are given below as suggestive of the 
Hebrew spirit of thanksgiving. Some of these verses 
might be repeated by the pilgrims as they lay their offer- 
ings upon the altar. Some of the songs might be.sung 
by the whole school. The whole scene should be digni-

fied and reverent. Most children hear Old Testament 
stories at home and in Sunday School, and the story of 
Joseph told in the third grade will stimulate the children 
to get the costumes and to try to learn more about the 
customs and ceremonies of his people. 
The above is one way of relating the daily work to the 
celebration of Thanksgiving, which seems to be the most 
difficult celebration for inexperienced teachers. When 
the children enter the fourth grade they will have a knowl- 
edge of Dutch life as a background for the stories of the 
Pilgrims who came to America. They will enter into the 
New England celebration with zest because they have 
some basis for appreciating the trials of the Pilgrims and 
the causes for gratitude. In the author’s judgment it is 
a serious mistake to repeat the same type of celebration 
in each grade. The charm of novelty is lost and the 
stimulus to effort is not so great. In the fourth grade, 
as in the third, there ought to be a contrast between the 
types of Thanksgiving. Because the children are fa- 
miliar with the Dutch manners and customs from their 
third grade work of the preceding year, they may under- 
take to represent a Dutch Thanksgiving as well as the 
first Thanksgiving in New England. In this way there 
will be a progressive series of celebrations, each a little 
more difficult than the preceding, and the children’s 
experience will be enlarged in a natural way. 
THANKSGIVING DAY? 
(Song for the Whole School) 
Praise to God, immortal praise, 
For the love that crowns our days ; 
Bounteous source of every joy,
-P-A-G-E-285
  ; THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 2738 
Let thy praise our tongues employ ; 
s All to Thee, our God, we owe, 
Source whence all our blessings flow. 
All the blessings of the fields, 
All the stores the garden yields, 
Flocks that whiten all the plain, 
Yellow sheaves of ripened grain ; 
Lord, for these our souls shall raise 
Grateful vows and solemn praise. 
Clouds that drop their fattening dews, 
Suns that genial warmth diffuse, 
All the plenty summer pours, 
Autumn’s rich o’erflowing stores ; 
Lord, for these our souls shall raise 
Grateful vows and solemn praise. 
Peace, prosperity, and health, 
Private bliss and public wealth, 
Knowledge, with its gladdening streams, 
Pure religion’s holier beams ; 
Lord, for these our souls shall raise 
Grateful vows and solemn praise.

STANZAS TO BE RECITED BY CHILDREN 
First child. 
Let the trumpets at the festival 
Their joyful voices raise 
To celebrate th’ appointed time, 
The solemn day of praise. 
For this a statute was of old 
Which Jacob’s God decreed 
To be with pious care observed 
By Israel’s chosen seed. 
Second child. 
Ye nations, to God 
Vow homage sincere, 
Devote to Him gifts, 
Love, worship and fear ; 
Before Him, ye mighty, 
Your spirits repress ; 
Ye high, and ye humble, 
His wonders confess !

Third child. 
Thy goodness does the circling year 
With fresh returns of plenty crown; 
And where thy glorious paths appear, 
The fruitful clouds drop fatness down. 
Fourth child. 
Large flocks with fleecy wool adorn 
The cheerful hills; the valleys bring 
A plenteous crop of full-ear’d corn, 
And seem, for joy, to shout and sing. 
Fifth child. 
Lord our God, for these, Thy bounties, 
Hymns of gratitude we raise ; 
To Thy name, for ever glorious, 
Ever we address our praise. 
The celebration of Washington’s Birthday offers obsta- 
cles that seem at first almost insurmountable. 
The teacher of keen intelligence and wide reading is 
able to compare Washington with the greatest men of 
other times and countries and to appreciate the Theleae. 
unique quality of his renown. But the primary pration of 
children are still unacquainted with the great Washing- 
heroes of romance and history and can secure ‘”’s Birth- 
only a meager knowledge of the conditions that a, 
produced them. To say that he was a nobler human 
type than any one of them, more complete in his nature, 
more happy in his cause or more fortunate in the issues 
of his career, would be to say words devoid of significance 
to primary children because they have not had sufficient 
experience of life or a sufficient knowledge of history 
and literature to understand such a statement.
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
Students in the high school know something of the 
importance of Washington’s influence in the Federal 
convention of 1787. They know how he withstood 
popular clamor and guided the new government for eight 
trying years. They can understand much of his civil 
and military achievements. They think of him as a 
man who could face adversity and overcome obstacles, 
a man victorious in war and successful in peace, but 
no such picture of Washington can be made comprehen- 
sible to children under ten years of age. 
Nevertheless, the primary teacher may gain the inspira- 
tion and the courage necessary to carry through an 
appropriate celebration of the day by calling to mind that 
not merely thousands but millions of school children 
scattered all over this vast country of ours are commem- 
orating the same event. Monuments of rare excellence 
have been reared to show the appreciation of a grateful 
people for him who taught Americans what greatness is, 
and pointed out the pathway to undying fame; but it is 
the teachers in our public schools who build a perennial 
monument to Washington. It is their privilege to make 
him live again in the hearts of each successive genera- 
tion and thus build up the American ideal of a public 
servant. Surely such a privilege, such an opportunity, 
is a motive strong enough to make each teacher eager to 
do her part, however small, in giving Washington a 
million tongued fame. 
The celebration of this holiday like all other holiday 
celebrations should grow out of the daily tasks. If the 
teacher plans to celebrate holidays at all, she should make 
the celebration an organic part of the year’s work. Surely 
the importance of this holiday warrants the expenditure

  278 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
of sufficient time and effort to produce a worthy and 
impressive celebration. The music should be stirring. 
There should be marches, processions, and songs and 
possibly a stately minuet. In rural schools and in city 
schools where older students are in the same building with 
the youngest children the greater portion of the celebra- 
tion should be mapped out and carefully planned in the 
upper classes. The material to be used is so abundant 
that a very different type of celebration could be given 
each year for several successive years. In the senior 
year of most high schools American history is studied. 
It is also studied in the eighth grade. The historic 
investigations can be assigned as regular work in those 
classes. Patriotic songs can be rendered by the whole 
school. The primary children should have only a minor 
part in any such celebration. They should participate 
in the marches or processions or flag drills and in the 
songs. Much of the significance of such a celebration 
the youngest children will fail to grasp, but they will be 
impressed with the patriotic fervor and reverence and 
festal spirit far beyond their power to express. The 
high school classes in English may compete in writing - 
prologues to introduce the scenes planned by the classes 
in American history. The scenes should be so planned 
as to include all of the pupils if possible. The geographic 
location and the arrangement of the building will deter- 
mine in a measure what can be done. F.g. If the loca- 
tion is Trenton, N. J., the school might undertake to enact 
the following scenes : 
1. Hessians gayly dressed feasting and carousing in 
Trenton, December, 1776. German bands and German 
choruses are heard in the distance.
-P-A-G-E-291
  THE CELEBRATION OF HOLIDAYS 279 
2. On the opposite side of the Delaware River is 
George Washington, dressed in a long black cloak, going 
from group to group of hungry, shivering Americans clad 
in homespun. All are intently watching the cakes of 
ice in the river. 
3. Washington’s army captures the Hessians December 
25, 1776. 
4. (Thirteen years later.) Washington’s reception by 
the maids and matrons of Trenton on his way to New York 
City to be inaugurated President of the United States. 
5. The crowning of Washington. 
A young lady dressed in the stars and stripes to repre- 
sent America recites the prologue that introduces each 
scene. The first three scenes afford opportunity for 
the boys in the high school and in the two upper grammar 
grades to participate. The two last scenes offer a similar 
opportunity for the girls of the entire school. The 
matrons of Trenton can be represented by the girls in 
the upper classes. The primary children may scatter 
the flowers in Washington’s path and thus reénact the 
scene. The words composed for the occasion are pre- 
served and are in part as follows: 
Welcome mighty chief, once more 
Welcome to the grateful shore ; 
Now no mercenary foe 
Aims again the fatal blow — 
Aims at thee the fatal blow. 
Virgins fair and matrons grave ; 
These thy conquering arm did save 
Build for thee triumphal bowers, 
Strew, ye fair, his way with flowers — 
Strew your Hero’s way with flowers.
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 SOCIALIZING THE CHILD 
In the last scene the stanzas of Hezekiah Butterworth’s 
“Crown our Washington” could be recited by four girls 
chosen to place the crown of laurel on the statue of Wash- 
ington or on a picture of him. As the last three lines, 
“To highest achievement the school leads the van, 
And crowning thy brow with the evergreen vernal, 
We pledge thee our all to the service of man!” 
are recited, a girl places a wreath of laurel or evergreen 
on the statue. The exercises might close with the sing- 
ing of Keller’s ‘‘ American Hymn” by the whole school. 
The best part of every such celebration is the enthusiastic, 
earnest work necessary to plan and carry out in detail 
each part of the program. The spirit of codperation 
and the vivid realization make lasting impressions upon 
all who take part. Schools located in Philadelphia, 
Pittsburgh, New York, Boston, Baltimore, or any other 
section would naturally select scenes more appropriate 
to their locality. The references at the close of this chap- 
ter will give suggestions for costumes and decorations.

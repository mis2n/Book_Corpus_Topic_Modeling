FIRST DAY’S PROCEEDINGS. 
Carnegie Library, Wednesday, November 22, 1905, 8 p.m. 
The meeting was called to order a few minutes after 8 
o'clock, p. m., by Rev. Dr. Ira Landrith. 
Dr. Landrith: As the nominal chairman of the local com- 
mittee that has had the honor to prepare for the coming of this 
joint meeting of these two great educational associations it is 
my duty to call this meeting to order. Will you kindly stand 
while you are led in prayer by the pastor of this church, the 
Rey. Dr. Trinnin. = 
PRAYER. 
Almighty God, we thank Thee for that providential care and direc- 
tion that has preserved the lives of so many men and women interested 
in the great work of teaching in our Southland, and bringing them to- 
gether tonight to confer in reference to the work that has been committed 
untc them. We thank Thee, our Father, for the great interest, the grow- 
ing interest in educational questions in the. South; we thank Thee that 
so many are interested, so many are conferring together and laboring 
together for the best methods and the best ways of teaching and training 
our youth. We pray, our Father, that their conferences here may be 
a wonderful help and inspiration to their participation. We thank Thee 
for the privilege of entertaining them, this honorable body of women 
and men, of meeting with them and having fellowship together, and we 
pray Thee, our Father, that their deliberations may be such as Thou 
canst smile upon, and that the meeting may be for Thy glory, in the 
advancement of all educational interests represented here. The Lord’s 
blessing be upon them and their work, and may their teachings and
-P-A-G-E-14
14 SourHeRN EpucatioNaL ASSOCIATION 
trainings not only be the teaching and training of the head, but of the 
heart, that both may work together for the highest culture and the bring- 
ing out of the noblest character. 
Again we ask, dear Lord, Thy blessings and benediction upon all the 
meetings and upon every conference, upon all the committees, the presid- 
ing officers, and glorify Thyself through these, Thy servants, in Christ 
Jesus, our Lord. Amen. 
Dr. Landrith: JI am very sure that every intelligent citizen 
of Nashville recognizes the coming of these two great associa- 
tions as an honor, but Nashville enjoys the distinction of having 
had, in a very delightful way, this honor thrust upon it and 
at a somewhat late hour. We were glad to undertake the work 
of preparing for the meeting of these associations, and in the 
short while we have had, we have done our best. The work 
that has been done in this brief period will show for itself dur- 
ing these three days. 
J think we ought to begin at the beginning, and before the 
program is taken up everybody in this audience should be 
given the opportunity to become a member of the Southern 
Educational Association so that the rest of the meeting may be 
yours and not merely a meeting which you witness. I shall 
therefore ask that the young gentlemen who have been fur- 
nished with membership slips shall immediately pass through the 
audience and place in the hands of everyone of you one of these 
slips, which you may immediately fill out, and at the conclu- 
sion of the meeting take with you to the registrar’s desk in 
the rear of the church, along with the two dollars which makes 
that application available. Let the ushers at once wait upon 
the audience, while I make some other announcements that 
are necessary. It is suggested that you can pay later than to- 
night. But the best time to pay will be tonight. 
Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 o’clock—and please let our 
friends and visitors note this—tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 
o’clock, by the courtesy of the street car company a trolley 
ride will be tendered you to visit points of interest in the 
city. The cars will leave promptly at 1:30 o’clock from the 
Fogg High School on the corner of Broad and Spruce streets. 
The only requirement as to fare is that you shall wear a badge 
as a member of the Association and that will cost you only two 
dollars. It carries with it, however, a great many other privi- 
leges which are worth many times two dollars, and the street 
ear fare will, therefore, be a little more than free. 
I want to call attention to this magnificent program which 
you hold in your hand for two reasons. In the first place, it
-P-A-G-E-15
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 15 
is the free gift of the Brandon Printing Company of. this city. 
All of the work upon it, except the actual preparation of the 
matter, has been done by the Brandon Printing Company, 
and wholly without charge to the local committee or any 
other committee, and I do not hesitate to say that as an exhibi- 
tion of beautiful printing, I have not seen it excelled. But 
the special reason for mentioning it is that it very materially 
changes the previously printed program which probably went 
to your homes, in this one particular, that the meeting places 
are not as they were in the first program, and you will have 
to depend upon the Nashville edition, the latest publication, 
and the one you hold in your hands. Tomorrow’s meeting 
will be held in accordance with the announcements which ap- 
pear in this program. i 
Let me make this additional announcement in reference to 
membership. Everybody is entitled to membership in the 
Southern Educational Association. Local persons, friends of 
education, by joining the Association tonight become, to that 
extent, patrons of education as represented by the Association, 
to further the ends of the movement which is to make educa- 
tion available and acceptable to Southern children, and your 
contribution will not only come back to you in the many ways 
which applies to the members of the Association, and ‘you will 
not only receive a free copy of the proceedings of this conven- 
tion-and enjoy all the privileges of this meeting but you will 
be thereby helping the cause of education, which is having its 
new birth in our blessed New Southland. 
At No. 709 McGavock street those of you who did not get 
rooms, may find, between now and nine o’clock tonight, the 
chairman of the committee that is looking after this particu- 
lar matter, and that leads me to remark that having done the 
best we could in every other particular, we deeply regret 
our inability to provide in the best hotels of our city, all the 
rooms you might possibly have desired. Abundant room has 
been obtained in private homes and the best boarding houses, 
but for reasons which are locally pretty well known most of 
the rooms in our hotels have been engaged for several days. 
However, I have the authority of the Tennessee Legislature for 
saying to you, gentlemen, that it will not occur again. (I.angh- 
ter and applause.) 
An address of welcome on behalf of the City of Nashville 
and the State of Tennessee will now be delivered by the Hon.  
-P-A-G-E-16
16 SourHERN EpuCcATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Rutledge Smith, who represents the Governor, who is absent 
unavoidably, on official business. 
Mr. Smith then addressed the meeting. 
Dr. Landrith: On behalf of the numerous educational 
institutions of Tennessee to which his assistant has referred, an 
address of welcome will now be delivered by Superintendent 
Mynders, of whom I may say, in a single word, he has been 
one officer certainly, who has been Superintendent of Eduea- 
tion in Tennessee. 
Supt. Mynders addressed the Associations. 
Dr. Landrith: It will be noted that this is the first joint 
meeting of the Southern Educational Association whose six- 
teenth annual session this is, and the Association of Colleges 
and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States, which is hold- 
ing its eleventh annual session. The presidents of these two 
organizations will now take charge of this meeting, the local 
committee having discharged as fully as it could up to this 
point, its duty, and being ready now in the most cordial possible 
way to meet your wish in every way during these days, if it can. 
I refer you to the two pages of names which are printed here, 
and you are at liberty to call on any one of us for anything 
we can do, from carrying your grip to carrying your burdens, 
of whatever other kind they may be. 
T have very great pleasure in introducing—not to these Asso- 
ciations who know him so well—but to the citizens of Nash- 
ville who are represented here on this prayer meeting evening 
which has called so many of our people away who would like 
to be here, President McIver of the State Normal College of 
Greensboro, N. C., President of the Southern Educational 
Association. 
At this point in the program President McIver took charge 
of the meeting. 
President McIver: I now have the pleasure of introducing to 
you President Ayers, President of the University of Tennessee 
at Knoxville, President of the Association of Colleges and Pre- 
paratory Schools of the Southern States. 
President McIver then delivered the president’s annual ad- 
dress, at the close of which he was followed by President Ayres, 
who delivered the annual address to the Association of Colleges. 
The title of President Ayres’ address was “The Place of the

Agricultural and Mechanical College in the Educational 
Scheme of the South.” 
Secretary R. J. Tighe announced that there were a limited 
number of copies of the proceedings of the last six meetings 
of the Association which could be had by applying to him and 
paying the price of two dollars per volume. 
The meeting thereupon adjourned to meet tomorrow morn- 
ing according to program. 
SECOND DAY’S PROCEEDINGS. 
Carnegie Library, Thursday, November 28, 1905, 9 a.m. 
Meeting called to order by President McIver, who an- 
nounced that the first topic on the program was, “The Funce- 
tions and Relations of State Universities,” by President D. B. 
Purinton, University of West Virginia, Morgantown, W. Va. 
President Purinton then read his paper. 
President McIver: The other topic for discussion this morn- 
ing, “Educational Progress in the Southern States During the 
Past Year,” by the various State Superintendents of Educa- 
tion will not detain us as long as the length of the program 
would indicate. In the first place, these state superintendents 
who have been asked to come before us and give us an account 
of their work have been requested to limit their papers to ten 
minutes. And I wish to state in advance that the object of 
this program was to have a brief statement from every South- 
ern State of the progress during the past year, and knowing 
the length of the list of names that would appear, the request 
was made that no paper should be given more than ten min- 
utes. And in justice to those who come last, as well as in jus- 
tice to the audience, I shall without any hesitation inform 
each person when he has been on the floor ten minutes. 
I will say also that six of those who are on the program are 
unavoidably detained, so that the program will not be so 
long as it appears to be. I say this, for I would like 
very much for this fine representative gathering of educators 
to listen patiently, and I am sure you will listen with ‘pleasure 
if you do listen at all to the papers presented by these chosen 
educational leaders of the Southern States. It is worth the 
trip here to see them and meet them and to know the men
-P-A-G-E-18
18 SourHERN EpUcATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
that the Southern educators have chosen for the great battles 
in their respective states. 
Now, the first is Mr. Isaac W. Hill of Montgomery, Ala- 
bama, but he has requested that Mr. H. C. Gunnells, the chief 
clerk of the Department of Education and identified with every 
educational work in Alabama, should present the report for 
Alabama, and I have the pleasure now of introducing to you 
Mr. H. C. Gunnells of Alabama. 
Supt. Gunnells made his report. 
The President next introduced Supt. John H. Hinemon of 
Arkansas, who made his report. 
President McIver: The next state is Florida, but the State 
Superintendent of Florida is necessarily detained by important 
engagements which he could not possibly leave. 
A. Member: I believe that nothing can be printed unless 
by order of the Board of Directors, unless the person is here 
to read his paper. I am very much interested in Florida, and 
I want to see Florida’s report in the next annual report of this 
body, and I move that we give Supt. W. M. Holloway per- 
mission to have his report printed, as he is unavoidably away, 
and Florida should be in the report of the proceedings. 
President McIver: May I make a suggestion? It is the 
purpose of the Executive Committee to suspend that rule in 
regard to all these superintendents who are absent, not in re- 
gard to other papers or addresses, but as we are inaugurating 
this little scheme of having a brief report from every state, 
we want to make it complete, and we want to ask the state 
superintendents who have prepared the reports and who were 
suddenly kept away to send them in, and I suggest that you 
include all of them in your motion. 
Mr. Hill of Alabama: I rise to make the point of order that 
it is a matter for the Board of Directors to consider, as provided 
by Section 2 of the By-Laws. 
President McIver: That is correct. We are obliged to fore- 
go the pleasure of hearing from Florida, but I think I can say 
to you that it will be in the printed report. Now we will hear 
from the great State of Georgia, through Hon. W. B. Merritt 
of Atlanta. 
Supt. Merritt reported. 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 19 
President McIver next introduced Supt. J. H. Fuqua of 
Kentucky, who made his report. 
President McIver: I regret that the Hon. James B. Aswell 
of Baton Rouge, La., within the past few days has been ob- 
liged to cancel his engagement to be here, on account of an 
important called meeting of the State Board of Education 
which was so urgent that he could not be with us today. 
So, next we will hear from Maryland, which will be repre- 
sented by Hon. M. Bates Stephens. 
Supt. Stephens reported. 
The following superintendents were next introduced and 
read reports: 
Mississippi, H. L. Whitfield. 
Tennessee, 8. A. Mynders. 
South Carolina, O. B. Martin. 
President McIver: I have a letter from Supt. J. Y. Joyner 
of Raleigh, N. C., saying that it is impossible for him to be pres- 
ent, as he had made an important engagement before the date 
of this meeting had been fixed, so we will not have the pleasure 
of hearing him at this time. 
I also have a letter from Supt. Cousins of Texas, stating 
that he is unavoidably absent, and sending us greetings. 
The State of Virginia is unfortunately in a transition state 
as far as the state superintendent is concerned, and unfortu- 
nately for this occasion we could get neither the old superintend- 
ent nor the new one, who has just been elected about a week or 
two ago. We wanted to have a report from Virginia, and I am 
satisfied we can get a report from Mr. Eggleston after he goes 
in, even on the past year’s work there. 
The only other report on the program is that of the Superin- 
tendent of West Virginia. I feel very much gratified that of 
the four states in the Union that have recognized the principle 
that the public ought to take a hand and say that a hundred or a 
hundred and fifty dollar teacher should not be allowed to teach 
—lI say, out of the four states that have been wise enough to take 
that step there are two southern states who are represented in 
this Association, and I am inclined to think the State of Mary- 
land takes the best position. ‘The only four states that have 
tackled this momentous question of salaries of teachers are, 
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maryland and West Virginia. And
-P-A-G-E-20
20 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
now we will hear from Supt. Thomas ©. Miller of West Vir- 
ginia. 
Supt. Miller read his report. 
President McIver: Now, we have gone through the program 
this morning and I think in a very reasonable time. There are 
a few announcements to be made. 
Mr. John H. Hinemon: Before you leave the reports of 
state superintendents I would like to make a statement that 
would not properly have heen a part of my report, but may 
be made here in justice to our people. In all our gatherings 
in the South, we hear a great deal said about local taxation. 
I want to say that has never been an issue in Arkansas. When 
the Constitution of Arkansas was adopted in 1874, provision 
was made for local taxation in every district of the state, and 
we have had local taxation all over the state. The agitation 
has not been a question of local taxation, but a question of in- 
creasing the local taxation, and I wanted to make that ‘plain 
to the members present. That is, increasing it from five to 
seven mills limit. 
The secretary read the announcements in reference to the 
meetings this afternoon and evening. 
The president announced the membership of the various 
committees as follows: 
Coiftmittee on Necrology—Prof. E. ©. Branson, of Georgia; 
Dr. George J. Ramsey, of Kentucky; Prof. Morris Page, of Vir- 
ginia; Supt. Thomas C. Miller, of West Virginia; Prof. Wal- 
ter Miller, of Tulane University; Prof. J. N. Powers, of Mis- 
sippi, and Prof. 8. H. Moore, of Texas. 
Committee on Resolutions—Supt. J. H. Phillips, of Alaba- 
ma; Supt. J. H. Van Sickle, of Maryland; Prof. Wickliffe 
Rose, of Tennessee; President G. R. Glenn, of the Georgia 
State University; Supt. J. H. Hinemon, of Arkansas; Supt. 
J. H. Fuqua, of Kentucky; and Supt. H. L. Whitfield, of 
‘Mississippi. 
Committee on Nominations—Supt. O. B. Martin, of South 
Carolina; Supt. S. A. Mynders, of Tennessee; Supt. I. W. Hill, 
of Alabama; Miss Clem Hampton, of the Florida Department 
of Public Instruction; Supt. M. Bates Stephens, of Maryland; 
Prof. F. P. Venable, of North Carolina, and Prof. J. W. John- 
son, of Mississippi.

The President called a meeting of the Board of Directors 
to meet at the close of this session. 
Adjournment was then taken. 
A street car ride was given to the members of the Association 
from 3 to 5 p.m. 
A reception was given by the faculty of Peabody College at 
the College from 5 to 7 p.m. to the visiting members. 
EVENING SESSION. 
Grace Cumberland Presbyterian Church, corner Lindsley Ave- 
nue and Market Street, Thursday, November 23, 8 p.m. 
The President: 
Ladies and Gentlemen—Before the address of the evening 
is delivered there are two announcements that I wish to give 
the opportunity to be made, one by the Superintendent of City 
Schools of Louisville, Superintendent Marks. It is an educa- 
tional announcement of special interest to the supervisors of 
schools. 
Mr. E. H. Marks here announced that the next meeting of 
the Department of Superintendence for the National Education- 
al Association will meet in Louisville, Ky., on the 28th and 29th 
of February and March 1, 1906, and extended a cordial invita- 
tion to the members of these associations to attend that meet- 
ing. 
President McIver then introduced Dr. George J. Ramsey. 
Dr. Ramsey announced that the Conference for Educa- 
tion in the South popularly known as the “Ogden Move- 
ment” has accepted an invitation to Lexington, Ky. to hold its 
next annual session in that city in April, or about that time, 
the exact time not having yet been determined. An invitation 
is extended these Associations to hold their annual meeting at 
the same time. 
The President: The speaker of the evening is a new man 
in this Association and has recently come to the State of 
Missouri, and he is at the head of one of the greatest normal 
schools of America. I have the pleasure of introducing to you

President James E. Ament of the State Normal School of Mis- 
souri, at Warrensburg. 
President James E. Ament then addressed the Association on 
“The Fourth Profession.” 
The President conveyed to the Association the invitation of 
the Medical Department of the University of Nashville to visit 
the classes and see them in their work, lectures, laboratories 
and quizzes. 
The members were requested to convene promptly at the 
Carnegie Library tomorrow morning for the transaction of im- 
portant business. An invitation was extended to those present 
to register and receive cards of membership in the Associations. 
Thereupon the meeting adjourned. 
THIRD DAY’S PROCEEDINGS. 
Carnegie Library, Friday, November 24, 1905, 9 a. m. 
President McIver: The Committee on Nominations not being 
now ready to report, that matter will be postponed until later. 
I think that before beginning the program this morning, this 
will be a good time for the offering of any sesolutions, so that 
they may be referred to the Committee on Resolutions. 
Mr. Rutledge Jones, of Memphis, offered a resolution on li- 
braries, which was referred to the Committee on Resolutions. 
President McIver: On the program first this morning then 
we will have the address or paper of President E. C. Branson, 
of the Georgia State Normal School at Athens. 
It is well for me to say in the beginning, as I did yesterday, 
that there is a limit to these papers and none of them are 
supposed to go beyond twenty minutes and time will be kept 
on them. 
President Branson addressed the meeting on “Reality Edu- 
cation.” 
President McIver: As the committee is ready we will now 
have the report of the Committee on Nominations. 
Chairman O. B. Martin: We beg leave to submit the fol- 
lowing:

President McIver: Unless there is some motion the voting 
will be by ballot on the adoption of the report of the Committee. 
A Member: Would it be proper to instruct the secretary to 
cast the vote of the entire body for these officers? I suggest this 
simply to save time. 
Motion seconded. 
On motion being put before the house it was unanimously 
carried and the Secretary cast the entire vote of the members 
present for the officers nominated by the Committee, and they 
were declared unanimously elected to the respective offices 
therein set out. 
President McIver: The next paper is “The County Super- 
intendent and His Mission,” by Supt. J. N. Powers of West 
Point, Miss. 
Supt. Powers then addressed the Association. 
President McIver: The next subject on the program is 
“Some City School Problems,” and I have a telegram from 
Mr. Cook saying that owing to some illness he is not able to 
be present, but he wants me to say that he sends his regrets and 
best wishes to the Association. He had expected to be present 
until the last moment, when he found it impossible to be with 
us. 
The next speaker is so well known to the Association because 
of his long and faithful service to it as well as by his faithful 
service in other educational causes throughout the South, that 
all T need say is that Prof. P. P. Claxton of the University of 
Tennessee at Knoxville, will now speak to you on “The Public 
High School.” 
Prof. Claxton now addressed the meeting. 
President McIver: The next paper is “The Private High 
School,” by Prof. W. R. Webb, of Bellbuckle, Tenn. 
Prof. Webb then read a paper.  
-P-A-G-E-24
24 SouTEERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
President McIver: We will next have “The Relation of 
the Southern College to the Publie School,” by Prof. 8. M. 
Tucker of the State College for Women at Tallahassee, Fla. 
Prof. Tucker addressed the meeting. 
Discussion on the High School question now took place, led 
by Prof. Webb. 
President McIver: We have now reached the hour for 
the special order, but I have some announcements I wish to 
make before beginning the discussion of the special order. 
We will have tonight in the First Cumberland Presbyterian 
church, two of the best addresses that could appear on this or 
any other program and you will not think less of them and I 
will not make you think less of them, when I tell you that both 
addresses will be brief. If you will be there promptly at eight 
o’clock, I promise you that President Snyder will close his ad- 
dress at 8:30 and that Dr. Smith, President of Davidson Col- 
lege, will take no longer than that, and any of you that are 
planning to do so, can leave on the 9:30 train. 
We will now take up the special order, the discussion of the 
time of future meetings. 
Mr. Branson of Georgia: In order to bring this matter to a 
head and to dispose of it for the discussion of a question I think 
more important than the question of time of meeting, I move 
that this meeting occur next year during the third week of 
November. The mere time of this meeting is an unimportant 
matter, compared to the organization or reorganization of this 
body and related bodies so that they may go to work upon defi- 
nite purposes, and I want the discussion this morning to be 
consumed for the most part in the consideration of the organiza- 
tion or reorganization of this Association into a live, compact, 
working machine, so that we may accomplish something. 
Motiov. duly seconded. 
President Ayers: I do not know that the question of date 
is a matter that is so vital to the Association of Colleges and 
Schools as the general distribution of time and working 
arrangements between the two Associations in case they should 
come together. I think, however, there is no difficulty in mak- 
‘ing such an arrangement as to enable the Association of Col- 
leges and Schools to do its work most effectively, while meeting 
at the same place and having some joint meetings. The mat-
-P-A-G-E-25
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 25 
ter, however, is open for discussion, and there are members of 
the Association present who I think will take part in the dis- 
cussion and express their views. 
Mr. Claxton: I want to say that it has been eight years since 
I was first secretary of this Association, but I believe that 
Thanksgiving would be the best time for our meeting, or, just 
a week before Thanksgiving. But there is a question I wanted 
to suggest. There has been for a number of years, a meeting 
that all Southerners have wanted to attend, a meeting that 
after awhile will likely cease to exist, but with which we could 
most appropriately meet, and it would still give us all plenty 
of time for our business. That meeting is known as the Confer- 
ence for Education in the South. Any meeting of that kind 
is only for a series of years, but inasmuch as the South is a very 
large country and it is not a matter of time, but of railroad 
fare, would not it be well if we could co-operate with that meet- 
ing ion 9) series of years until it ceased to exist, and then 
absorb whatever enthusiasm it may leave. 
Mr. Hayes: The discussion has suggested to my mind the 
advisability of making an amendment to Prof. Branson’s mo- 
tion, and that is this: We can not determine the time of these 
other meetings, but we can cordially invite all those others to 
meet with us and can appoint a special committee if necessary 
to solicit their meeting with us at the desired time. I there 
fore move that Prof. Branson’s motion be amended by adding 
that we extend a cordial invitation to all kindred associations 
in the South to meet with us at this time, and that a committee 
of three be appointed to extend that invitation to all the others. 
Mr. Branson: I don’t understand the motion. 
Mr. Hayes: The motion was, instead of the motion as made, 
that we meet at this time, instead of deciding that, and that the 
other associations meet at this time, that we invite them all to 
meet with us, and appoint a special committee for that pur- 
pose, or instruct the Executive Committee to that effect. 
Mr. Claxton: I think it would be better to refer the whole 
matter to the Board of Directors. Contingencies might arise 
which would make it necessary to change the date of the meet- 
ing. Therefore, as a substitute for the amended motion I 
move that the entire matter be referred to the Board of Di- 
rectors, with full power to act. 
Motion duly seconded.
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Branson: I accept that substitute, or accept anything, 
just so we can get this thing off our hands to get to something 
more important. 
Motion to refer to Board of Directors, as above, being put 
by the President, was unanimously adopted. 
President McIver: It is necessary for some consultation. 
As Prof. Ayers said, if we have this meeting very early in 
October it would conflict with other meetings. I want to 
say this, and I know the importance of it, because I had the 
responsibility of it before. It is very important, if we are 
going to meet in the month of November, that that be decided 
before we leave, so that the people may have a year’s notice to 
get ready. I believe we ought to meet as suggestd, and that 
we ought to meet on Friday and Saturday, so that the teachers, 
or at least the teachers in the state where we meet, for miles 
around even, could get there for Saturday, anyway. In other 
words, a week-end program with possibly some religious work 
on Sunday. But that, of course, will come under the direction 
of the Board of Directors. 
Meeting thereupon adjourned. 
EVENING SESSION. 
First Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Friday, November, 
24, 1905, 8 p.m. 
Meeting called to order by President McIver. 
President McIver: Ladies and Gentlemen—We now come 
to the closing exercises of the sessions, and we will listen to 
two of the foremost educators of the country, professional 
teachers who have risen to the head of important educational 
institutions in their respective states of North Carolina and 
South Carolina. All of us can remember the time when the 
head of an institution of this kind was either a politician or a 
preacher, and sometimes both in one. But we are reaching 
the time when school teachers are going to be the heads of 
educational institutions. 
The first paper is “The Denominational College in South- 
ern Education,” by Henry N. Snyder, President of Wofford 
College, Spartanburg, 8. C.
-P-A-G-E-27
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 27 
President Snyder addressed the meeting. 
President McIver: The next speaker will address you on 
the subject of “A Plea for Some Old Ideals’—Mr. Henry 
Louis Smith, President of Davidson College, Davidson, N. C. 
When an old man speaks for youth and vigor, and a young 
man speaks for old ideals, then we have a happy blending. I 
have the pleasure of presenting to you Dr. Henry Louis Smith, 
President of Davidson College. 
President Smith read a paper. 
President McIver: Ladies and Gentlemen—lIt is not yet 
nine o’clock, and we wish to have the report, before we adjourn, 
of the Committee on Resolutions, and the Committee on Ne- 
crology, I believe, has asked for a continuance of that Com- 
mittee, to report a year hence, as it is too big an undertaking 
to be hastily handled. 
Superintendent Phillips of Alabama will now make the 
report for the Committee on Resolutions. 
Mr. Phillips: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen—I 
wish to say that only two resolutions have been handed in, 
and they were too late for the Committee to pass upon them 
and hence they will not be read in this report. Our report 
is as follows: 
The Southern Educational Association assembled in its sixteenth an- 
nual session, reiterates its conviction, that the one paramount question 
today, essential to the material, civil and moral development of the 
States of the South, is that of popular education, and encouragement 
of the rapid development of public sentiment in the South with regard 
to this subject. It emphasizes its purpose to secure for all schools effec- 
tive organization and economical administration in order that all the 
youth of our land shall enjoy the largest possible measure of educational 
opportunity, and to this end publishes the following declaration: 
1. We recognize the integrity of all educational agencies and the ne- 
cessity of purpose in all educational departments, from the Kindergarten 
to the University; we commend the establishment of kindergartens 
in cities and village communities and sympathize with the movement 
that seeks to incorporate the kindergarten as an organic part of our 
local school systems whenever possible; we endorse the establishment of 
the public high school and urge the recognition and encouragement of 
secondary education by legislative support, as a department of state 
education, co-ordinate with the elementary school and the college; we 
urge that the several departments of our educational system, in city, 
country and state, be so adjusted by concentration and correlation, as to 
prevent unmecessary waste by diffusion or dissipation, or by duplication 
of energy, courses of study and equipment. 
2. We believe that the principle of local taxation for schools is just 
and equitable, and that the proportion of school funds so derived should 
be largely increased in every state, thus developing a higher degree of 
community responsibility, and a larger measure of efficiency in the schools 
of the people.
-P-A-G-E-28
28 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
3. Believing that the duty of the State to establish and maintain schools 
for its educable youth, implies the co-ordinate right to render its provi- 
sions effective, we endorse such legislation in the several states as shall 
effectually mestrict child labor, and secure the compulsory attendance at 
school of all educable youth under fourteen years of age. 
4. We hail with pleasure the tendency towards greater economy and 
efficiency in school administration by the consolidation of schools, both ur- 
ban and sectional, the demand for longer terms, better buildings and 
equipment and more efficient supervision. 
5. While we endorse most heartily all agencies employed in the spe- 
cial preparation of teachers, and in the improvement of teachers already 
in the service, we urge insistence upon a grade of scholarship which shall 
at least be equivalent to that required for the completion of a good 
high school course, as a prerequisite to ‘entrance upon a course of profes- 
sional training. 
6. We endorse the recommendation so ably presented by President 
McIver in his annual address, that this Associatoinn shall inaugurate a 
concerted movement in all the States of the South for the purpose of 
securing to the teachers of our common schools, both rural and urban, 
the payment of such salaries as shall be commensurate with their duties 
and responsibilities, and which will justify capable men and women to 
enter and to continue in, the profession of teaching. 
7. We recognize the value of industrial and manual training as an 
element in the ideal of elementary and secondary education, and endorse 
the idea that the schoo] shall fit the child to become an economic as well 
as a political and moral factor in the civilization into which he is born. 
8. While we endorse physical culture and athletics in schools of all 
grades, we sincerely deplore the tendency in our high schools and colleges 
to lower the ideals of our educational institutions through the question- 
able practices and the intemperate enthusiasms of strenuous athletics. 
We urge upon our educational authorities the importance of preserving 
in all things educational a due sense of proportion, and a sane regara 
for the true ideals of academic and university life. 
9. Believing the library to be an important ‘and an essential factor 
in the educational development of a people, we urge that special atten- 
tion be given to the upbuilding of school and college libraries, and to the 
establishment of public libraries in rural as well as urban communities 
throughout the South. 
10. In order that the several educational organizations of the South- 
ern States may become more effective, we cordially invite all such organi- 
zations to meet with the Southern Educational Association in its an- 
nua! meetings in order that the strength of each may be supplemented 
by the united strength of all. 
In conclusion, we tender the sincere thanks of this Association to the 
several officers who have labored so successfully to make our session 
now Closing so profitable; our thanks and grateful acknowledgements 
are also due to the several local committees who have so carefully pro- 
vided for the comfort and entertainment of the Association and to the 
citizens of Nashville for the generous hospitality extended to the mem- 
bership of the Association. J. H. PHILLIPS, Chairman. 
President McIver: What will you do with the report ? 
Mr. Phillips: On behalf of the committee, I move the adop- 
tion of the report. 
Motion duly seconded and unanimously carried. 
President McIver: The only other matter to come before us 
is a report I had forgotten. The chairman of the committee
-P-A-G-E-29
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 29 
is away, but Chairman Venable has handed me the following 
report of the committee appointed to audit the accounts of the 
Treasurer, and I will read it: 
To the President and Members of the Southern Educational: Association: 
The committee appointed to audit the accounts of the Treasurer of the 
Southern Educational Association beg to report that they have examined 
the accounts and vouchers of the Treasurer, Mr. E. P. Burns, and find 
them correct. A baiance of $532.58 remains in the Treasurer’s hands. 
Respectfully, 
J. M. GUILLIAMS, 
JOHN H. HINEMON, 
F. P. VENABLE, 
Committee. 
On motion duly made the report of the committee was 
adopted. 
President MeIver: I wish to say before adjournment that 
this is the beginning of a broader and a greater day for this 
Association, and as I said in my opening address, I believe 
Nashville will be eventually glad we came, because of that 
fact, for we will grow into a much greater organization in the 
future, and I am certain if it grows larger, or if it does not 
grow larger, we will be glad to come to this city again. I do not 
know where we could go where we would be treated more hospita- 
bly and more happily entertained than here. It remains for 
this Association to carry the correct report and the correct spirit 
of the Association and its purposes, to those members of the 
profession who have recently joined, or who have not been 
with us at this time. I am sorry your new President is not 
able to be here. He has, as Vice-President, in my absence, 
had a great deal to do with the preparing of this program, and 
I am glad that he will have charge of the meeting next year. 
Wherever you go, you may expect equally as strong a pro- 
gram and as faithfully carried out as this has been, and I 
think in many ways improved. We have thought of many 
improvements that could be made, some we had planned at 
this time but could not carry out because of exigencies. 
I hope by uniting all the organizations that are engaged in 
educational service in the Southern States, and not scattering 
our work, that we may come together and make a great im- 
pression in the year to come, for the cause that is so dear to us. 
And in conclusion I beg that all that can do so will make sug- 
gestions to any of those in authority in managing the Associa-

tion, in regard to the subject which I called to your attention 
“at the opening meeting. That every county superintendent, 
every state superintendent, every city superintendent, every 
college man, every teacher, will insist at all times that we ought 
not pay larger salaries to cotton pickers, tobacco strippers, and 
street cleaners, than we are paying to those who are rearing 
our little children. 
Let us remember that we can not have good teaching by 
multiplying schools and weak teachers. In mathematics, two 
halves make a whole, while two half-teachers do not make a 
whole teacher. We had better have some consolidation and 
some system. 
I appreciate very much the courtesies shown to the chair. 
I appreciate particularly those superintendents who came here 
and who were accustomed to presiding over an entire state dele- 
gation, and speaking an entire day, perhaps, and I appreciate 
their coming here and boiling it down to ten minutes and 
letting us have ten speeches in less than an hour and a half. 
If we will make this annual inventory and then have our 
other meetings as we have had them here we will grow stronger 
and more useful. 
As there is ngthing further, the meeting will stand ad- 
journed.

Mr. Hinemon moved to have a statement of educational prog- 
ress from each of the absent state superintendents published 
in the proceedings. Carried. 
Dr. McIver opened a discussion for means of increasing the 
membership in the future. He favored paying the expenses 
of good musicians to the meetings in order that the program 
might be made more attractive. 
President Abercrombie asked for suggestions from other 
members. 
Mr. Burns stated that he had enrolled thus far 104 members 
from outside of Nashville and this number represented fifteen 
states. In discussing the relative merits of the certificate and 
coupon plans he favored the former. 
There was some further discussion on this matter by Messrs. 
Ramsey, Hinemon, Davis and Tighe. 
Mr. Davis suggested correlation with state organizations and 
the plan of having delegates elected from each state to at- 
tend, thus making the Association more of a representative 
body. Messrs. Claxton, Hinemon and Phillips discussed this 
idea further. No action taken. 
Superintendent Phillips expressed the belief that the best 
plan was to affiliate with other live associations, like the Asso- 
ciation of Colleges, Southern Library Association, ete. There 
should be one great organization consolidated from the num- 
erous small weak ones that are now trying hard to exist. 
President Venable said one objection to this plan for the As- 
sociation of Colleges was that frequently it seemed advisable 
for it to hold its meetings in places too small to accommodate 
the Southern Educational Association. 
President Abercrombie stated that the Board would now con- 
sider invitations from cities desiring the next meeting. None 
were offered. 
On motion the meeting adjourned.

ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
Hon. Rurtever Sirs. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
By reason of the enforced absence from the city of our dis- 
tinguished Governor, in whom we have the best friend of 
education in Tennessee, he bids me speak to you upon this 
occasion. 
With great pleasure we welcome the representatives of these 
splendid organizations to the home of education, refinement 
and culture. It is very fitting indeed that you should hold 
the sessions of this Association under such conditions and sur- 
roundings as greet you in Nashville and in Tennessee. No 
state in the South can boast of so many universities, colleges, 
and high institutions of learning as does the Volunteer State. 
Here in this state, in this territory of fruitful and prolific 
fields, that produce profitably every crop and fruit that is 
grown in the entire union, with the single exception of the 
orange of Florida, our matchless resources are diversified. We 
could build a wall around Tennessee and produce everything 
that is necessary to the comfort, happiness and civilization of 
our people. Here the air is the purest, the dewdrops are more 
brilliant and the songs of the birds are sweeter than those of 
any land. But we do not choose to thus rock-ribbed encompass 
ourselves, but rather to keep open house in order that our 
friends may come hither and enjoy our hospitality and pros- 
perity. Nature has been lavish to Tennessee, and we have 
not ‘been unmindful of our opportunities. With our strong 
and sturdy manhood, and with the examples of our illustrious 
forefathers, we have builded wisely and well, and be it said to 
out credit that we can today boast of an educational and in- 
dustrial development excelled by no state in this union. With 
joy and glad hearts do we welcome you to the proud old Volun- 
teer State, and we bid you enter most heartily into the spirit 
of our boundless hospitality. (Applause. )

ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
Hoy. S. A. Mywnpers, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Tennessee. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Southern Educa- 
tional Association and Association of Colleges and Prepara- 
tory Schools of the Southern States: 
I am indeed glad to represent the school interests of Ten- 
nessee in welcoming you to our midst. | We esteem ourselves 
fortunate that this joint meeting of these two great bodies 
should be held in Nashville. | We esteem ourselves indeed 
happy that we have as our guests so many of the leaders in the 
solution of the greatest problem that confronts the people of 
ihe Southern States today. We anticipate, in your counsel and 
advice, many valuable suggestions that will help us in the state 
of Tennessee in solving 
In the development of he problem that is mutual. 
any people there are three great neces- 
sary factors: First, the natural wealth of the country—Nature 
and God have endowed 
everything that is necess he South with all of these. We have 
ary for the commercial and industrial 
development of a great people. We are blessed with every- 
thing beneath the ground and above that Providence could pro- 
vide for a great nation. Next, the natural ability of a peo- 
ple. There are no people in the world that surpass the people 
of the Southern States in native ability. Here is the purest 
strain of Anglo-Saxon blood; here is the best element of for- 
eign immigration located in the Southern States, and forming 
the population of this great part of the government of our 
country. These two elements are here: Nature on the one 
hand, and on the other the native ability of the people. These 
two are not changeable. We have the products; we have the 
country; we have the climate. They have been given to us 
for development and for our use. The native ability, I repeat, 
we have; this is unchangeable; and the third element is the 
only one that is given us to change and develop to an extent to 
make the two others available: this is intelligence—the educa- 
tion of our people. Upon this education must depend, alto- 
gether, the manner in which we develop this natural wealth and 
the extent to which we develop ourselves to become factors in 
the greatest civilization the world has ever known.  
-P-A-G-E-35
ADDRESS OF WELCOME 35 
We welcome you, then, ladies and gentlemen, as those who 
are to help us in the solution of this great problem, the de- 
velopment of our wealth, and the development of our people. 
There are many factors that must enter into this work and 
into this development. I sometimes think that possibly in 
this age and time we are accepting the commercial spirit, and 
in our greed for industrial education and those things that will 
develop our wealth we are inclined to teach our people that 
civilization is dependent altogether upon the commercial de- 
velopment and industrial development of the country. These 
things are well and good in the solution of the great educational 
problem, though there are many factors that must enter; and 
it is indeed an auspicious beginning when we can say that we 
are meeting together, public school men, public school super- 
intendents, private school men, men of colleges and. universities, 
and of denominational and state institutions, all working to solve 
the great problem that lies before us. There was a time when the 
public school system was not popular in the Southern States. 
That time has passed, and today all classes of citizens, all 
classes of educational workers, recognize it as a great factor in 
the development of people. It is indeed a happy occasion 
when we can meet in this Athens of the South, and with 
united hearts try to solve the great problem that confronts the 
Southern people. There is work for each to do. In the devel- 
opment of all our people, in the development of our citizen- 
ship, the public school is an absolute necessity, and we must 
found a government upon intelligence; we must look to the 
entire people, not only to perpetuate this government, but to 
develop it to the greatest extent, and to make it a leader in the 
civilization of the country in which we live. We must look to 
the public school not only for the development of citizenship, 
but for the beginning of that preparation for life to which 
every boy is entitled. We must look to the public school sys- 
tem for that assistance that is to prepare him for the actual 
duties of life. But that is not all. If this were all, then in- 
deed the commercial and industrial development of the country. 
would be the great problem confronting its educators. But 
there are other sides to this. We rejoice when we study the 
great intellectual development in the South, and the great 
work that is being done by our colleges and schools in this di- 
rection. We rejoice that physical development has found a 
place in the educational system of the Southern States. By
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the side of the college and the preparatory and the high school 
of today is a gymnasium properly equipped. We rejoice, then, 
that physical development has taken a place in our educational 
system. We remember, too, with grateful hearts, that all 
over the South we are putting up technological schools and 
schools for industrial development. But there is another side 
to education, and one that must not be overlooked. I refer to 
that education that is tc fit our boys and girls for society; that 
education that is to fit them for the duties of life and those 
duties that do not involve the making of money and the devel- 
opment of wealth. We are seeking for happiness. We are 
looking to this age to furnish not only prosperous conditions 
financially, but those higher enjoyments that can come alone 
from a thorough intellectual culture of our people. Then this 
side is not to be neglected, and we hail with delight the coming 
among us of these people who have the working of that higher 
intellectual development,. realizing that prosperity in this day 
and time depends not only on money making, but upon intel- 
lectual culture and development that fit us for the full enjoy- 
ment of the civilization of the twentieth century. 
I am admonished that an address of welcome must be brief. 
I welcome you, then, as workers among the little children of 
the Southern States; I welcome you as workers in state insti- 
tutions that are preparing our boys and girls for the technical 
occupations of life; I welcome you as members of these great 
faculties that are preparing our boys and girls for citizenship ; 
I welcome you as faculties of denominational and preparatory 
schools that are providing that higher culture of mind and soul 
that will prepare our boys and girls for leaders in this world 
and teach us that the civilization of the age demands a thorough 
and well rounded culture of manhood and womanhood. 
ANNUAL ADDRESS. 
Dr. Cuartzs D. McIver, President Southern Educational Association. 
In selecting the unusual date of this meeting of the South- 
ern Educational Association, your Executive Committee has 
obeyed the evident sentiment of the last meeting in Jackson- 
ville, Fla., against holding our annual meetings during the 
Christmas holidays. The necessity for the change is due to the
-P-A-G-E-37
ANNUAL ADDRESS 37 
fact that in the South Christmas week, more than any other, 
is the week for family gatherings, which always prevents the 
attendance of many teachers; and to the fact that several of 
the state teachers’ associations and the National Association 
‘of Science Teachers hold their meetings at that time. Your 
committee, moreover, believing that for the sake of economy 
and strength it is a mistake to have itwo representative meet- 
ings of Southern educators with so many members belonging 
to each organization, began negotiations with the authorities 
of the Association of Southern Colleges and Preparatory Schools 
with a view to uniting the meetings of the two Associations. 
The selection of the date for the meeting so that it could 
be attended by the largest possible number of teachers was 
difficult; and every person here ought to make his most thought- 
ful suggestions to the Executive Committees in regard to the 
date of the next joint meeting in case the present experiment 
shall appear to justify its continuance. 
Personally, I am inclined to the opinion that more teachers 
would attend the meeting if Friday and Saturday were the 
principal days, the Sunday following being filled with an in- 
structive program on education in the Sabbath School. If this 
plan should tbe adopted very few teachers would need to lose 
more than one or two days from their regular work, and by 
using the Saturday before the meeting and the Saturday after 
instead of Friday and Monday, practically no time would be 
lost from regular school or college work. 
At any rate, there seems to be a demand and a genuine 
necessity for decreasing the number of general organizations 
depending upon the attendance of representative Southern 
educators. I believe not only that the combination of these 
two meetings is a step in that direction, but that the com- 
bination will be advantageous to both organizations and to the 
general cause of education. 
More than a year ago it was thought wise for the Southern 
Educational Association to publish a statement setting forth 
the reasons and necessity for the existence of the organization 
and its purposes. It is not my intention to reiterate the facts 
contained in that statement. I may be permitted to say, how- 
ever, that the mere pleasure of meeting friends and colleagues 
in service, delightful as that is and as helpful and necessary 
as an occasional meeting for that purpose may be, is not 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
sufficient justification for the expense in time and money and 
the inconvenience involved in attending annual meetings. 
Even pleasure of such high order will pall except as am 
incident of business. 
This organization must devote itself seriously to some good, 
generous cause and do efficient service for that cause if it is 
to have life and lasting quality. The pleasure of association 
must be an incident and not the prime object of the annual 
meeting. The joy of helping a good cause results not only in 
giving occasion for the meeting of friends, but in uniting 
strangers and harmonizing discordant elements. This very joy 
has made many an army march happily and triumphantly 
through hardship and slaughter. 
If the Southern Educational Association, while not neglect- 
ing the general interests of education, elementary and higher, 
will decide upon a policy and devote itself persistently for 
several years to the promotion of one particular educational 
reform, it will not only accomplish great good in that special 
direction, but will incidentally cause the organization to 
grow in numbers and in power and will strengthen any other 
good cause that it may advocate. 
The improvement of our educational conditions depends 
largely upon the creation of new and more liberal public 
sentiment, not only among the masses of the people, but among 
the cultured and the wealthy classes. As a profession we 
need all the knowledge we have and more in regard to educa- 
tional conditions, but above all we need the ability to use such 
knowledge in such way as to stimulate the minds of the people 
so that they may see their duty and their own interest in 
making more liberal investment in all kinds of education. 
We ought to be able to persuade people of wealth in the South 
and elsewhere to invest a portion of their means in educational 
plants, but above all we ought to be able to impress any 
American community with the wisdom and necessity of liberal 
taxation for a general public school system. I do not think 
that any intelligent person familiar with the subject believes 
that this generation is investing in the training of its children 
in accordance with its ability, its duty, or its economic 
interest. If this be true the teaching profession ought to be 
able to make the truth clear and ought to be able to lead the 
people to action; and the Southern Educational Association 
and the Association of Southern Colleges and Preparatory
-P-A-G-E-39
  ANNUAL ADDRESS 39 
Schools, representing as they do educational leaders of every 
class, have a task before them of sufficient importance and 
sufficient difficulty to challenge the power and courage of 
every member. There may be different opinions among us as 
to the relative importance of certain phases of our educational 
work. Some might find it difficult to do enthusiastic service 
for industrial education; others might feel that they could 
use their influence more wisely for the public good in some 
other direction than by advocating a larger investment in 
higher education; still others might not see the wisdom of 
establishing strong public high schools in connection with the 
public school system; there might be a difference of opinion 
as to the proper division of public and private investment 
between young men and young women who are seeking educa- 
tion beyond the publie school system; and there would be 
some good men and women even who could not give en- 
thusiastic service in the cause of more liberal provision for 
the training of teachers. There is one question, however, of 
primary and fundamental importance upon which all leaders 
in the profession could unite, and by uniting, could do effective 
service to our generation and the generations to come. It 
seems to me that the best service as citizens that college and 
university presidents and professors and other educational 
leaders could perform would be to arouse public sentiment in 
favor of more adequate compensation for educational service 
in the elementary branches. Of course, it is generally under- 
stood among intelligent people that the compensation for teach- 
ing, whether in university, college or district school, is not 
what it should be, but if the leaders of the profession should 
lead an agitation upon that subject, the ignorant man and the 
suspicious man, and the man who is indifferent to education, 
and the tax-hater would combine to accuse them of working 
merely for the increase of their own salaries. Moreover, as 
a matter of fact and justice, it is well to remember that the 
majority who work in high schools, colleges and universities 
are able to live without engaging in any other work, whereas 
the salary of the average public school teacher in the United 
States is little more than $300 a year, and the average salary 
of the Southern rural public school teacher, where three- 
fourths of our population live, is less than $200 a year, which 
means that these teachers must earn a part of their living in 
some other work besides that of teaching. It is difficult to 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
employ unskilled labor for less than $1 a day, and yet in 
public and private schools millions of children are being 
trained for American citizenship by people who receive less 
compensation than that. 
This question of compensation of elementary teachers is 
not a mere local question. The rural public school teacher in 
New England, in the North Central section and in the West, 
is little better off in this particular than the Southern rural 
teacher. 
In July, 1905, the National Educational Association pub- 
lished a carefully prepared report on Salaries, Tenure and 
Pensions of Public School Teachers in the United States, from 
which the following interesting facts in regard to the salaries 
of elementary teachers can be secured: In cities of more than 
a million population—namely, New York, Chicago and Phila- 
delphia—the average salary is a little over $900. In the 
sixteen cities whose population is more than 200,000 and less 
than a million, the average salary is $677. In the cities 
with a population between 100,000 and 200,000 the average 
salary is $603. In the 418 cities with a population of from 800 
to 100,000 the average salary ranges from $446 to $572. In 
all the cities of the country, except four (Chicago, Ill.; Colum- 
bus, Ga.; Meridian, Miss, and Washington, D. OC.) the 
earnings of laborers who sweep the streets and clean the sewers 
is larger than the lowest salaries paid to elementary teachers. 
The report shows further the salaries paid to school teachers 
in typical rural ungraded schools. The highest and lowest 
salaries for women teachers in these schools being: 
In Maine, $118 and $268; in Massachusetts, $206 and 
$400; in Connecticut, $180 and $450; in New York, $160 
and $600; in New Jersey, $225 and $500; in Pennsylvania, 
$140 and $450: in Maryland, $170 and $447; in Georgia, $90 
and $400; in Ohio, $138 and $485; in Indiana, $144 and 
$440; in Illinois, $150 and $405; in Michigan, $175 and 
$500; in Minnesota, $200 and $450; in Iowa, $132 and $360; 
in Missouri, $100 and $900 ($495 being the next highest 
salary below $900); in South Dakota, $120 and $405; in 
Nebraska, $75 and $405; in Kansas, $150 and $440; in 
Colorado, $178 and $520; in Utah, $136 and $788 (the next 
highest salary below $788 being $450); in Washington, $200 
and $585; in California, $360 and $850; in Oregon, $90 
and $400.
-P-A-G-E-41
  ANNUAL ADDRESS 41 
In North Dakota the county having the lowest average 
salary pays $254, and the county having the highest average 
salary pays $405. The average salary in Texas is $201. The 
average salary in South Carolina is $203 for white teachers 
and $83 for colored teachers. In Virginia the average salary 
is $166. : 
A minimum salary law has been adopted by five states 
—Indiana, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and North 
Dakota—which will make it impossible for an ignorant people 
to entrust their children to teachers who can be employed at 
salaries ranging from $75 to $150 a year. The minimum 
salary in Pennsylvania, for instance, is $245; the minimum 
salary in Maryland, $300. 
The simple statement of these facts to the thoughtful peo- 
ple of the country ought to work a revolution, and, in my 
judgment, the best service the leaders of our profession can 
perform is to present them in such way as to arrest and hold 
the attention of the general public until its conscience and 
judgment shall compel the adoption of a wiser policy. 
ANNUAL ADDRESS. 
Brown Aynrss, President Association of Colleges and Schools. 
On July 2, 1862, there was approved a congressional act the 
influence of which on the education of the people of the 
Union has been extraordinary. By the enactment into law of 
the far-seeing plan of Justin S. Morrill there was inaugurated 
a new era in higher and technical education. By the single act 
referred to there was rendered possible in every state of the 
Union a college where the industrial classes could be given at 
once the elements of a liberal education and the preparation 
for some definite career in the direction of the great industries 
of the country. As a piece of statesmanship this act is un- 
surpassed, and entitles the name of Morrill to a prominent 
place on the roll of fame. In the language of the noble au- 
thor of the act: “The act of 1862 was intended to give those 
whose lives were to be devoted to agriculture or the mechanic
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
arts, or other industries, embracing much the largest part of 
our population, some chance to obtain a liberal and practical 
education. The colleges in existence did not pretend to (. 
anything more than to educate young men for the three pro- 
fessions of divinity, law, and medicine and surgery.” At the 
time of the preparation of this act there existed only one 
school of engineering in the whole union, outside of the na- 
tional military and naval academies. The Renssalaer Poly- 
technic Institute, at Troy, New York, had begun work in a 
limited field, but had not developed to any great proportions. 
The Sheffield School at Yale, and the Lawrence School at Har- 
vard, while vaguely outlined, had not really begun their reg- 
ular work in applied science. Industrial conditions had not 
yet crystallized into a definite demand for better and more 
effective workers; the country at large was hotly engaged in 
the discussion by word and pen, and later by sword, of po- 
litical and social questions that were well calculated to absorb 
the interest of the lawmakers. Yet in this troublous time Mr. 
Morrill was able to look far’ beyond the strife about him and 
with a clearness of vision and a largeness of soul that were 
extraordinary to lay the foundation for an educational de- 
velopment such as the world had never before seen. No sec- 
tional lines were to be observed in the outworking of the 
contemplated scheme. No distinctions by caste, or creed, or 
race were to mar the symmetrical development of this truly 
democratic ideal. While rejecting no one, it invited all, and 
in a spirit of true Christian brotherhood opened the way to 
many a soul that without it would have been condemned to 
utter desolation and. neglect. Tried by any test, whether of 
industrial success or of true philanthropy, the Morrill bill 
stands as one of the greatest pieces of constructive legislation 
that has ever been enacted. Directly traceable to its aid and 
influence has been the establishment of such institutions as 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Sheffield Scien- 
tific School, Cornell University, and the great state universi- 
ties and technical schools of the West. The influence of these 
and similar schools has ‘been felt in all the marvellous indus- 
trial development that has placed our country in the forefront 
of world powers. And not only here, but throughout the civ- 
ilized world has the leaven worked. Our beloved Southland, 
rising bleeding from the lashes of war, found in the aid given 
it by the Morrill bill the tonic and the food needed to restore
-P-A-G-E-43
ANNUAL ADDRESS 43 
its wasted strength. No one can gainsay its great and perma- 
nent benefit to us, and we should be quick and eager to recog- 
nize our obligation. 
Gradually, as one Southern state after another was able to 
avail itself of the provision of the act, there has arisen in each 
state one or more institutions supported in whole or in part by 
the appropriations of this act. The history of their develop- 
ment is in some cases a painful one. By unfortunate mis- 
takes many of these schools have been erected as distinctly 
separate from the pre-existing state universities, a fact that 
has been ‘a serious handicap to them and to the state universi- 
ties as well. By their separateness there have tended to come 
about a class distinction and a rivalry which have caused pain 
to all who love the cause of education and who are true demo- 
crats. Dependent for their larger development on the favor 
of the states, they have not escaped a political control that in 
many cases has seriously handicapped their development, and 
lacking the presence of the idealists of the university proper 
they have not always given the liberal ‘training contemplated 
by their founder. Sciolism and superficiality have naturally 
been a phase of their development, but gradually they have 
adjusted themselves more or less completely to their environ- 
ment, have found the proper field for their efforts, and are 
today doing splendid work for the upbuilding of the Southland. 
But in a measure each one stands alone, in no definite and 
organic relationship to the schools below it on the one hand 
or to the schools above it on the other. While hospitably re- 
ceived by the national organization of such schools, these South- 
ern land grant colleges lack yet a unifying force that will place 
them in proper relation to each other and to the general edu- 
cational scheme of the South. Can we not hope that such a 
unifying force will be forthcoming? 
Ten years ago, almost to a day, there was organized at At- 
lanta ‘the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of 
the Southern States. Conceived by the eminent scholar and 
educator who has served it continuously from its inception as 
its secretary and treasurer, and owing its vitality and wide 
spread influence largely to his true educational statesmanship 
and devotion, this Association has been in every sense a. bless- 
ing to the eause of true higher education in the Southern 
States. Though at the time of its formation the educational 
system of the South had already begun to take form and defi-  
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
niteness of character, there was yet lacking a co-ordinating 
force by which the full benefit of existing and future educa- 
tional foundations could be realized. Those engaged in the 
work of higher education lacked definiteness in their concep- 
tion of the places to be filled by their respective institutions. 
Those engaged in the work of secondary education were al- 
most equally at sea in their understanding of their own fields. 
Chaos, more or less orderly, was the condition that prevailed. 
The ten years that have passed have seen a wonderful change 
and improvement. We now have rather definite notions of 
the relations of college and secondary school; we have taken 
counsel with each other as to the best means for the removal 
of our local difficulties; we have come together on a co- 
operative plan for the setting of standard examination ques- 
tions for entrance 'to college; we have done these and many 
other things and they are good. But throughout the whole of 
this period we have had in mind, largely if not exclusively, the 
needs and problems of the college of liberal arts, forgetting 
that a complete solution of its problems and needs, in its re 
lation to the system of preparatory schools, might still leave 
largely unsolved the larger problems of the relation of all the 
lower schools to all the higher schools, whether these latter be 
purely academic or semi-professional in character, or wheth- 
er the former be the special fitting schools or the much larger 
number of public schools, conceived and operated with no 
clear-cut, purpose of college preparation. Would it not be 
a useful thing for this Association at the outset of its second 
decade of existence to enlarge its scope to an extent sufficient 
to bring in the large number of exceedingly valuable technical 
and industrial colleges on the one hand, and the still larger 
and rapidly increasing number of public schools on the other ? 
Would our organization not gather strength as well as breadth 
from a closer relation with these schools of the people, and 
would not the general cause of higher education in the South 
be greatly helped by a well-considered plan of this kind? Our 
present policy rejects institutions in most of the Southern 
States which ‘appeal strongly to the present sympathies and 
needs of the people of ‘those states, and schools whose duty 
it is to train by far the larger number of the future citizens 
of ‘the South. Can we not, without in any way lowering our 
standards or altering our requirements for purely academic 
work, enlist the active interest of the agricultural and mechan-

ical colleges and other technical schools, and by co-operation 
with them help them to see more clearly their.own place in 
the educational scheme, and make them the co-workers with 
rather than the rivals of ‘the academic colleges proper in their 
own and other states? And can we not so broaden our con- 
ception of proper college admission requirements as to en- 
able the public high schools to find a place in our counsels, 
along with those that have a more restricted object or purpose? 
In other words, is not the time ripe for a greater democracy 
and a wider field of usefulness for this very valuable Associa- 
tion? 
Perhaps the most striking and signicant phenomenon of the 
educational development of the last quarter of a century has 
been the extraordinary growth and success of the great state 
universities of the middle West and the Pacific coast. Found- 
ed as most of them have been by the government land grants 
provided for in the Morrill bills of 1862 and 1890, these state 
universities seem to have met the needs of the masses of the 
people to a quite remarkable degree. Beginning as they 
usually did with the more special consideration of the needs of 
agriculture and the mechanic arts, they have gradually en- 
larged the sphere of their activities and influence until now 
they oceupy almost the whole realm of human knowledge and 
appeal to all classes of citizens. | Where a few years back 
their students were numbered by hundreds they are now num- 
bered by thousands, and the annual appropriations received 
from the state legislatures by many of them would have been 
considered adequate endowments for universities a generation 
ago. The actual service that they render to their several com- 
munities can hardly be reckoned in dollars and cents; yet on 
this basis alone it has come to be recognized that their direct 
return far exceeds the cash outlay required to keep them going 
and expanding. Their history seems to establish most clearly 
the .value of this type of institution to an undeveloped ‘and 
developing section. They are the “colleges of the people,” 
and the “people” in this sense constitute by far the majority 
of the population. 
With few exceptions the Western States have not made the 
mistake of separating the purely academic instruction and the 
more technical kind especially contemplated by the Morrill 
act. From the point of view of economy and true democ- 
racy this is cause for sincere congratulation to them. Such
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 SovurHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
developments were, perhaps, only possible under the truly dem- 
ocratic conditions existing in these western states. Class dis- 
tinctions, so familiar to us in the South, and to a lesser but 
still definite degree in the East, were and are now relatively 
non-existent in the West. The existence of class distinctions 
and prejudices is sufficient to explain the unfortunate steps 
taken in most of the eastern and Southern States where insti- 
tutions to carry out the purposes of ‘the land grant act were 
established separately from and, in most cases, independently 
of, the state universities or other already existing institutions, 
thus not only tending to confirm and perpetuate the undemo- 
cratic class prejudice that brought them into being, but con- 
stituting them for a long term of years rivals for patronage 
and favors. This condition must inevitably weaken the gen- 
eral educational system and prevent the attainment of the 
best results. There is no denying the fact that these land 
grant colleges appeal to the hearts and, in some measure, sat- 
isfy the needs of the people, and in the South we have seen 
them develop in a phenomenal manner while the purely aca- 
demic institutions seemed for a time to be left behind. There 
is not, however, any conflict of interest between the two types 
of colleges, nor should there be, if each understood the other 
and by mutual helpfulness more fully realized the rounded 
educational scheme of the state. To leave land grant colleges 
to solve their problems unaided or to foree them into ‘an organ- 
ization independent of the present one, would be to lose an 
opportunity to do a real service to Southern education and erys- 
tallize yet more definitely the feeling of jealousy and rivalry. 
It may be contended that there is nothing in the present con- 
stitution of this Association that excludes land grant colleges 
from membership. A little consideration will show, however, 
that the present by-laws, being framed specifically to meet the 
needs of the liberal arts colleges which constitute our member- 
ship, are such as to exclude the land grant colleges, not solely 
because they are lower in grade, but also because they are differ- 
ent from the colleges of ‘the older type. Relying as they must 
on the public schools, and even on the rural schools, for their 
supply of students, it is useless for them to expect for many 
years to cover the preparation contemplated by the by-laws of 
our present organization. Such requirements as they can 
exact should be exacted by them, but there must be a large 
amount of elasticity in requirements, else they will fail to   
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  ANNUAL ADDRESS 47 
reach the classes for which they were established and will lose 
the opportunity to do a large and useful work for their states. 
Would it not be possible to invite these colleges to come into 
our Association on a basis that would allow them to maintain 
their logical relation to the industrial classes which they serve 
and yet feel the inspiring effects of association with institu- 
tions which must and should stand for somewhat higher ideals 
than they themselves could independently establish? I be- 
lieve that it would be both possible and beneficial to all of 
us and to them. The ways and means for the accomplish- 
ment of this may require long and careful consideration. I 
do not attempt ‘to suggest a final solution of the problem, 
but I believe the beginning will lie in the recasting of our 
requirements for admission ‘to college, extending the list of 
subjects that may be offered to cover all subjects that are 
taught “in public secondary anid high schools,” and adopting 
the point system with a smaller number of points required 
to enter a land grant or technical school than is required to 
enter a college of liberal arts. This will allow of the recogni- 
tion of agriculture, domestic science, and certain manual work, 
the introduction of which into our public schools, both rural 
and urban, will mean so much for the masses of the people in 
our Southern States. It will also bring about a unification 
of our public school and collegiate instruction, a consumma- 
tion that is devoutly to be wished. 
The land grant colleges would not be the only gainers by 
the adoption of the point system and the closer affiliation with 
the public high school. As now constituted ‘the colleges of our 
Association apparently look largely for their supply of well 
prepared students to private fittings schools or to the compara- 
tively few good public high schools in the larger cities of the 
South. This supply is by no means large—and if the trend 
of things in the South is to ‘be similar to that in the West, as 
seems altogether likely, the private fitting school will in time 
become almost a vanishing quantity. The extraordinarily 
rapid growth in numbers and beneficent influence of the great 
universities of the West would hardly have been possible if 
they had looked to the private schools for their supplies of 
students. And yet will any one question the solidity of their 
academic achievements? May we not by following in their 
footsteps be more likely to reach a larger development than 
would ever be possible to us by following our present course?

  48 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
While this Association exists primarily for the objects speci- 
fied in its constitution, namely, to consider the interests com- 
mon to colleges and preparatory schools, I do not think that 
it should stop with the consideration of these interests in any 
restricted sense. I think that without encroaching too much 
on the field of our sister organization, the Southern Educa- 
tional Association, it might with great advantage consider 
very carefully the relation of the public school movement to 
the college and the relation of the college to it, looking to a 
rational and practical adjustment that would make the line 
of least resistance lead directly to the college door. To leave 
the working out of the public school system to the schoolmen 
alone will not tend to produce a healthy condition of the col- 
leges, unless ‘the colleges are ready to capitulate entirely and 
accept the dictum of the schoolmen as to what they may expect 
from their incoming students. By a cordial and helpful co- 
operation the adjustment may be so fairly made as to accom- 
plish all that either party has a right to expect. 
When the colleges individually, or through this Association 
collectively, approach the study of the public preparatory 
school system as it is, they must do so in a spirit of compromise 
and with readiness to yield many cherished ideals, if careful 
study shall show tthat these ideals are not adapted to the needs 
of the great body of the people. For in a Christian democ- 
racy like ours the way must by all means be left open to any 
youth, no matter how lowly, or how poor his advantages, pro- 
vided only that he have ambition and industry. To block 
the progress of such an one by arbitrary conditions that, through 
uo fault of his, he can not possibly fulfill, is surely not either 
wise or generous. In a careful study of the high school ques- 
tion in the South presented to this Association at the 1903 
meeting, Superintendent E. C. Brooks, of Raleigh, N. C., 
clearly pointed out the chaotic condition of our high school 
situation as a whole, and the lack of co-ordination of educa- 
tional effort is clearly indicated here as well as an inability of 
the land grant colleges under present conditions to become ac- 
tive members of this Association. Can we not take a broader 
view of the whole situation and extend the scope of our present 
Association so that more order may be brought into this educa- 
tional chaos, and a more perfect ‘alignment brought about of 
all of our collegiate and preparatory institutions? I look for- 
ward to the time when this may be done and we shall by a

better mutual understanding and helpfulness remove the bar- 
riers that keep us apart and which now tend to produce mis- 
understanding, prejudice and jealousies. If this Association 
will become the active agent in this reconciliation its future de- 
cades will far exceed in usefulness the very valuable one that 
has just closed. 
FUNCTIONS AND RELATIONS OF THE STATE 
UNIVERSITY. 
PrEsIDENT D. B. Purinton, University of West Virginia, Morgantown, 
West Virginia. 
The state university has come to be the typical seat of liberal 
learning in America. Our American. universities may be 
roughly divided into four classes: denominational universities, 
as Chicago, Princeton, Oberlin, Ohio Wesleyan; private cor- 
porate universities, as Harvard, Leland Stanford, Clarke, Tu- 
lane; city universities, as New York, Cincinnati; and state 
universities, as now found in nearly all of the states of the 
Union. Forty years ago denominational and corporate uni- 
versities were greatly in the lead. Since that time state in- 
stitutions have been steadily and rapidly gaining in relative 
importance, prominence and power. Specially within the last 
decade has their growth been phenomenal. In one case, the 
student body has grown from 280 to 1,100, in another, from 
600 to 3,400. These institutions now have more than five 
thousand instructors and sixty-five thousand students. There 
are fifty) American institutions whose students number one 
thousand or more each. One half of these are state univer- 
sities. There are eight institutions with about four thousand 
students each. Four of these are state universities. Nor is 
this all. The quality of their work is quite equal to its quan- 
tity. In thoroughness of instruction, wealth of equipment, use 
of advanced methods and fruitfulness of original investigation, 
state universities are easily in the front rank. A careful ex- 
amination will show that these institutions now outclass either 
of the other three classes named, and are practically equal to 
all three of the classes combined. It will be readily seen, 
therefore, that a consideration of the functions and relations 
of the state university is distinctly worth while in a gathering 
of American educators.
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
I. The function of the state university is purely and solely 
educational. It is neither political nor partisan, neither sec- 
tional nor sectarian. Its purpose is to furnish appropriate and 
ample educational facilities for the entire citizenship of the 
state whose interest it serves. To accomplish this purpose there 
are four characteristics of its work which are manifestly es- 
sential. It should be altruistic, democratic, cyclopedic, peda- 
gogue. 
1. That it should be altruistic seems almost self-evident. 
The state university does not exist for itself, is not an end in 
itself, is only a means to an end, a servant of the state. But 
all true service is altruistic. All noble character is built on 
devotion to a cause. The self-seeker is universally and right- 
eously self-condemned. The world’s historic heroes have been 
self-forgetful altruists, every one. Even life itself is trans- 
mitted and perpetuated on principles of practical altruism. 
The parent is devitalized for the vitalization of the offspring. 
Even among lower orders of life beautiful examples of altruism 
are often observed. 
And yet in the higher walks of human life this principle 
seems to have been strangely forgotten. The more fortunate 
classes are forgetful of the less fortunate. The educated are 
criminally unmindful of the needs of the ignorant. Colleges 
and universities have not infrequently been under this just 
condemnation. They exist to and for themselves. They are 
quite too prone to wrap themselves in their robes of intellectual 
superiority and educational self-righteousness, to dwell apart 
from ordinary men and to care little or nothing for the strug- 
gles of the work-a-day world on the lower levels of life. But 
this spirit of educational Phariseeism is happily passing away. 
Education is not now viewed as an end in itself, but only as a 
means to a greater end. That end is useful service. We still 
agree with Emerson that the college bred man is the most 
fortunate of men and one of Heaven’s chiefest favorites. He 
is such, however, not from any selfish satisfaction he may draw 
from his own learning, but because of his added power to 
serve other men. We now ask of such a man, not “Who is 
he? Who was his father? How was he bred? What is his 
pedigree?” But we rather ask: “What can he do? What is 
he doing for the weal of the world?” And we judge him ac- 
cordingly. The spirit of these questions has with peculiar pro- 
priety permeated the university life. The modern institution 
of liberal learning exists, not for itself, but for the good it
-P-A-G-E-51
FUNCTIONS AND RELATIONS OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY 51 
can do. And this is especially to be expected of the state uni- 
versity which derives its existence and support from the entire 
commonwealth. It lives to serve. 
2. But, again, the work of the state university should be 
democratic as well as altruistic. It is needless to say that this 
term “democratic” is here used in its etymological and not in 
its political sense. These two terms “democratic” and “altru- 
istic” are by no means identical. That narrow-minded deacon 
who, according to the venerable story so often repeated, prayed 
thus, “O, Lord, bless me and my wife, my son John and his 
wife, us four, no more,” was doubtless altruistic enough, but 
not at all democratic. Now some such spirit has sometimes 
been observed in institutions of learning. They ask for a large 
blessing, indeed, but do not care to have it very widely distrib- 
uted. It is desired for the few, not for the many, for the fa- 
vored classes, not for the froward masses. Now, whatever may 
be said of the right of some universities to exist and to operate 
solely for the rich and the favored few, one thing seems certain. 
No state university has any such right. Specially and emphat- 
ically is this true of that large number of state universities 
which are receiving the benefits of the Congressional Land-Grant 
Acts, so-called, of 1862 and 1890. The first of these Acts, 
as ‘you remember, provides for the setting apart of about 
ten million acres of the public domain, to be appropriated 
per capita to the several states and territories for the estab- 
lishment of institutions for the free education of the masses 
of citizens who in the several states might avail themselves 
of the advantages thus offered. The second Act, popularly 
known as the “Morrill Act,” makes additional provision 
of $25,000 per annum for each state, for the furtherance 
of the same purpose. This purpose was declared by Senator 
Morrill, author of the two bills, to be “to enable the indus- 
trial classes of the country to obtain a cheap, solid and sub- 
stantial education, and get it when they could not in any 
other way, because of the cost of the classical schools of 
the country.” These words of his are simple in their great- 
ness and great in their simplicity. The legislation to which 
they refer was original, unique and epoch-making in the history 
of education. Never before in the annals of the world had 
any state or nation made general provision for the highest 
education of the lowest classes of her citizens. To the United 
States among nations and to Senator Morrill among statesmen, 
belongs the honor of this great deed. And it means much in 
every state university which has accepted its provisions. It
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
means that in any such state the humblest farmer who tortures 
a meagre existence out of the unwilling soil and barren rocks 
of his paltry acres, and who pays but a few paltry pennies into 
the state treasury, has just as much right for. himself and 
for his children to all the privileges and advantages of the 
state university as has the multi-millionaire whosé tax bills 
may require seven figures to compute them. Such is the genius 
of the state university. There is to be, neither within its halls 
nor without them, any aristocracy whatever save that of intel- 
ligence and character. The poor man’s son is to have equal 
chance with the rich. No costly methods of traditional cus- 
toms or contemptuous coteries are to make intolerable the 
university life of the student who has the grace and grit to 
work his own way through college. The rather is he to be spe- 
cially honored for his noble ambition. 
Now this is a comparatively new idea in university life. Be- 
fore the Land-Grant Acts no such spirit prevailed. University 
education was expensive—so very expensive as to cut out the 
poor. It is still so as a rule in universities of the old type. 
A good illustration of the situation has recently come to the 
notice of American educators in connection with the univer- 
sity of Oxford, England. The Cecil Rhodes Scholarships in 
Oxford furnish fifteen hundred dollars a year to each student. 
But the holders of these scholarships are officially notified be- 
forehand that the amount named is barely sufficient to pay 
the necessary expenses of a year’s residence at Oxford. Notice 
what this means. A father with five children to educate must 
furnish between thirty and forty thousand dollars for their 
education at Oxford. And this in addition to home expenses 
must tax the resources of a poor man beyond all possibility of 
accomplishment. It is practically prohibitive. The American 
state university with its free tuition and moderate demands 
is by no means so exacting. One-fourth of the above named 
amount may well suffice if need be. Indeed, any American 
youth with good health, good mind, good character and perse- 
vering efforts, may take a full course in his own state univer- 
sity, if he really determines to do so. And this is altogether 
as it should be. In such a country as ours at least state edu- 
eation should be broadly democratic. 
8. But, again, the work of the state university should be 
eyclopedic. By this I mean that all subjects of study should 
be included in the curricula of the university. As all students
-P-A-G-E-53
  FUNCTIONS AND RELATIONS OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY 53 
who apply should be received, so likewise all studies desired 
should be offered. This obligation, like that previously men- 
tioned, grows likewise out of the very constitution of the uni- 
versity. The Land-Grant Act of ’62, to which reference has 
already been made, explains its purpose in these words, “In 
order to promote the liberal and practical education of the in- 
dustrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.” 
“Not excluding classical studies.” Now these are very wide, 
ample and inclusive provisions. “Liberal and practical educa- 
tion in the several pursuits and professions in life”? That in- 
cludes almost everything. Liberal education takes in the 
classics, science, art, philosophy, in a word all the culture 
studies, so called. Practical education takes in all professional 
schools, commercial and mechanical pursuits, clinical and shop 
work, and the application of mathematics and science to manu- 
facturing, mining, handicraft, manual training, and all other 
useful work in which a citizen may properly engage and for 
which ample provision is not otherwise made. This was tho 
evident intention of congress. And in conformity thereto, 
every state accepting the provisions of the congressional grant 
is expected to offer instruction in all branches of useful knowl- 
edge, the only limitation being the financial ability of the state 
itself. Indeed, this is the basal idea of any university proper- 
ly so called. It is to be, as its very name implies, a univer- 
sity—a universe of knowledge, or a knowledge of the universe. 
It is therefore the plain duty of the state university to prepare 
any citizen for any work which the well-being of the state de- 
mands. This means the physician, the attorney, the teacher, 
the musician, the engineer, the farmer, the soldier; but it 
means also the mason, the bricklayer, the carpenter, the weaver, 
the miller, the manufacturer, the merchant and the banker as 
well. Indeed, it means the “butcher, the baker and the candle- 
stick maker.” This view involves an immense responsibility 
to be met. The ultimate goal to be sought is nothing short of 
universal knowledge. As far as may be possible, the work of 
the state university should be cyclopedic, all-embracing. 
4. But once more. University work should likewise be ped- 
agogic. And this term is here used in its etymological sense. 
Under the ancient Greek system of education, you remember, 
the PAI4AT2Tr0s—the pedagogue—was literally the boy- 
leader, the one who guided the student to the place and pres- 
ence of the master from whom the great truths of classical 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 SovuTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
learning were to be received. Now in some such sense. the 
state university should be a PAJ4AT'2QT0 5—a boy-leader, a 
youth-leader, whether of boy or of girl, a wise and infallible 
guide to new truth. It should be abreast of the times, should 
have and use the best methods, should furnish the highest posst- 
ble ideals of thought and life, and should strive as far as may be 
to realize them in its professors and its students. It should un- 
dertake original investigations, push out into the unknown and 
widen the realm of knowledge. No citizen should feel called 
upon to apologize for his university, simply because the state’s 
university should be above reproach in all things. 
Nor is this all. The university ought to be a safe and wor- 
thy leader in all matters educational throughout the state. It 
should interest itself in everything that makes for the good 
of the youth of the state. It should lend a sympathetic, help- 
ing hand to every wise endeavor for the improvement of edu- 
cation along any of its lines from the bottom to the top. Par- 
ticularly should it stimulate intermediate and secondary schools 
to be and do the best that is possible to them. All educa- 
tional history shows that pedagogical progress is handed down 
from above and not pushed up from beneath. High schools 
are not pushed higher by schools below them. They are 
pulled higher by schools above them. This pulling process is 
one of the evident duties of the state university. ‘For this 
additional reason the university must be ahead of the age, 
rather than behind it, must face the rising sun, take the bold 
initiative and look for new results. 
It will be admitted, I think, that the work of the state 
university as herein outlined is broad, important, exacting, 
burdensome. To meet such demands, great wisdom, broad- 
minded statesmanship and unlimited resources are imperative 
ly required. If here and there a failure or defect in some state 
university may be found, no thoughtful citizen will be sur- 
prised, offended or discouraged thereby. But all good citizens 
will nevertheless insist that the standard be set high, and that 
the university actually measure up to it as far and as fast as 
possible. 
II. A second question remains to be discussed, namely, 
The relations of the state university. I am admonished, how- 
ever, that the limits of this paper will admit nothing more 
than a discussion of exceptional brevity. The chief relations
-P-A-G-E-55
  
FUNCTIONS AND RELATIONS OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY 55 
of the state university are of two kinds, those to other educa- 
tional institutions and those to the state itself. 
1. As to other institutions. The university is the highest 
institution in the state, and as such is at the head of the edu- 
cational system of the state. It is therefore organically and 
intimately related to all other elements of the system, whether 
they be high schools, normal schools, professional schools, 
grammar schools, graded or ungraded schools. This relation 
should always be recognized as cordial, appreciative and help- 
ful. It should be critical only when necessary, and thor- 
oughly sympathetic even then. As organic parts of one and 
the same educational body, these institutions must suffer to- 
gether if need be, and rejoice together if it may be. The rela- 
tions of the state university to private and denominational in- 
stitutions located within the state are of a different character. 
There is nothing organic or essential here. And yet an atti- 
tude of comity, courtesy and co-operation should always be 
maintained. Certainly nothing that approaches antagonism 
or rivalry should ever exist. In every state there is ample 
room for the denominational college as well as for the state 
university. Each has its place to fill, its work to do. Both 
are needful to the best good of either. Both contribute to 
the same ultimate end. They are educational brothers, co- 
workers in the great cause of universal intelligence, virtue and 
righteousness. Let them join willing hands in fraternal co- 
operation for the weal of society, the home, the church and the 
state, and all will be well. 
2. But there is another and utterly different relation of the * 
state university, that is, to the state itself. This relation is by 
no means fraternal or co-ordinate. It is rather filial on the one 
hand and paternal on the other. The university is in a sense 
the creature of the state, created by its authority, supported 
by its resources, subject to its will. It is therefore the serv- 
ant of the state. Notice, I say servant of the state, the entire 
state, not of any particular portion of the state, nor yet of 
any particular class or interest in the state, nor even of the po- 
litical party which may chance to dominate the state. Educa- 
tion is for all citizens alike, and must forever be strictly non- 
local and non-partisan. As such the state university may 
loyally serve the entire commonwealth and may earn the grati- 
tude and honor of all good citizens. 
A story is told of Alexander the Great, how on a certain
-P-A-G-E-56
    56 SourHeRN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
occasion he was in pressing need of a large quantity of gold. 
A certain mule-driver was started to the capital with the requi- 
site amount of the precious metal. When in sight of the 
palace, the mule, utterly overcome by reason of the great weight 
and the rapid driving, fell beneath his burden and refused to 
go farther. Whereupon the driver, loyal to his trust and to 
his king, with superhuman effort raised the gold to his own 
back and struggled on toward the palace. Alexander, seeing 
‘his noble deed and observing that he, too, was about to fall be- 
neath the precious burden, is said to have said, “Bear up, 
brother, bear up a few steps farther, for all the gold thou bear- 
est shall be thine.” The story may be apochryphal, but it is 
certainly beautiful, a story of faithful service on the one hand 
and of generous reward on the other. 
Now the average American state is not exactly an Alexander, 
nor is its university exactly a mule-driver. The students, at 
least, would protest against such an uncomplimentary compari- 
son. And yet in its arms of loving endeavor, every state uni- 
versity is bearing for the state a burden of youth and beauty 
and human possibility far more precious than gold and far 
more needful to the state than any amount of gold could ever 
have been to the great king. Let us hope that this service will 
be loyally rendered and royally recognized by the great com- 
monwealth in whose interest it is put forth. 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
ALABAMA. 
Hon. H. C. Gunnezs. 
I am here, Mr. President, to represent our most excellent 
State Superintendent, whose modesty forbids him to tell the 
good things which have been accomplished in Alabama during 
the last year. It is a case of Aaron and Moses, except that 
in this instance Moses is not only the power behind the throne, 
but if he would only speak, is the much better speaker. 
I am to say something of educational progress in Alabama 
during the last year. Let it be understood that I am out of 
school and am telling enly good things. Of course everything
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 57 
is not as it should ‘be down in that good state where people no 
longer rest, but hustle; but we tell our difficulties and short- 
comings to our own folks, we talk them over to our children at 
our own fireside and chastise in accordance with the gravity 
of the sins. : 
These people assembled here in Nashville have not a thing 
in the world to do with our internal—I was about to say 
eternal—disturbances. We are trying to look after them, and 
if a determination born of duty’s strong conviction foreshadows 
success, we will look after them properly. 
I want to tell you, however, some things that have been ac- 
complished in the last year. In Alabama there is a law allow- 
ing counties by a three-fifths vote to levy a one-mill tax for 
schools. Since last April this tax has been levied in fourteen 
counties. In these fourteen counties there are 836 school dis- 
tricts and the state school fund has been supplemented $50,000. 
The county of Clay, a mountain county, and composed almost 
entirely of property owners, with only a branch railroad touch- 
ing it, out of a total of 3,400 qualified electors, cast only thirty- 
nine votes against the measure to levy the one mill tax for 
schools, and it is said that these thirty-nine votes were not legal 
votes, for our constitution especially denies the right of suf- 
frage to persons of unsound mind. 
During the summer that has just passed, hundreds of school 
houses have been built—good school houses—and they are 
building today. One is being finished as I am talking. I 
can almost hear the last nail as it is driven home. We are 
building them at the rate of more than one a day. 
When it is taken into consideration that in Alabama the 
state does not aid in any way in the building of school houses 
the importance of this movement will be more readily under- 
stood. Every public school house which to this date has been 
built in Alabama has been built from money directly out of the 
pockets of the people who patronize the schools. The people 
have come to see the need for good school buildings and they 
are building them in all parts of the state. The last legis- 
lature of Alabama passed a law allowing county boards of 
revenue, under certain conditions, to issue bonds for the pur- 
pose of building school] houses. The county of Perry, a black 
belt county where there are 1,912 white children and 7,326 
negro children, is about to issue bonds to build a modern school 
house in every district. Other counties will follow suit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
By far the most important accomplishment in the interest 
of education in Alabama has been the awakening of public 
sentiment along this line. Six years ago the state democratic 
platform, after repeated efforts on the part of friends of edu- 
cation, contained a declaration in which it was said, “We 
pledge the people that, in the matter of public education, no 
backward step shall be taken.” Today every candidate for 
office, from governor to constable, declares emphatically, en- 
thusiastically, and unconditionally, in favor of public educa- 
tion, of more money for schools, for better schools, longer terms 
and better teachers. No longer do we confine ourselves to 
the doubtful declaration that no backward step shall be taken. 
The declaration now is: “We declare for and pledge a for- 
ward movement in the matter of public education.” So strong 
is this sentiment in favor of publie education in Alabama that 
a short while ago the Governor of the state, in an address in 
which he was discussing the proper use of a surplus of nearly 
one million dollars in the state treasury, recommended that 
the same be appropriated to the public schools of the state. 
For some time, a few months ago, the matter of calling an 
extra session of the legislature of Alabama for the purpose of 
making such an appropriation had the serious consideration 
of the Governor of the state. 
Alabama has just cause to congratulate herself upon the 
standard of the teaching force in her public schools. Under the 
administration of our state law for the examination of teach- 
ers, incompetents have been weeded out. A demand from 
trustees for first-class and only first-class teachers has been in- 
stituted. No longer does a good teacher have to hunt for a 
position, but the positions are hunting for the teachers. So 
lively is the sentiment in favor of public education that the 
people in the rural districts have begun to learn that the coun- 
try child is entitled to as good a teacher as is the city child, and 
these trustees are repeatedly impressing upon the teachers that 
unless they become enthusiastic in their profession, unless they 
keep up with the procession, they are no longer wanted. 
A remarkable advance has been made in the length of the 
public school term. A few years ago the average length of the 
term was three months. For the year beginning October 1st 
nearly half of the counties require and will have school of at 
least seven months’ duration, absolutely free of tuition fees. 
This rapid advance comes as a direct result of the levy of the
-P-A-G-E-59
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN ‘STATES 59 
one-mill school tax, and instead of reducing the salaries of 
teachers has increased them twenty-five or thirty per cent. 
I feel that I should be remiss did:I not give proper credit 
for the work which has been accomplished. Supt. Hill, as 
the head of the educational department of the state, has led 
this fight all along the line for better and for higher things. 
Not one day has he been idle, but in thought, in plans, and in 
active speech, he has stirred every city, town, hamlet and rural 
district in Alabama to hope for and demand the very best for 
their children. 
Let me close by using the words of the late Joseph B. Gra- 
ham, who was one of the best friends the cause of education 
ever had in Alabama: 
“Be it said to the credit of Alabama, that, although her 
people are comparatively poor, though she has in common with 
other Southern States suffered the disasters of war and borne 
the burdens and sacrifices of reconstruction, and though forty- 
four per cent. of her population belongs to a race which pays 
but little more than five per cent. of the taxes, still our new 
organic law forbids that discrimination inspired by prejudice 
which would restrict the educational privileges and rights of a 
particular class or race according to its contribution in taxes 
for the support of the government. This equality of benefits 
did not arise from any cringing fear of federal amendments, 
but from a spontaneous philanthropy too generous to take ad- 
vantage of the poor, and a sense of right and humanity too 
proud to stoop to wrong an inferior race. 
“In my opinion, the highest and sincerest expression of the 
principle of fraternity and the most splendid prophecy of the 
permanence and high standard of our future civilization are 
to be found at one and the same time in the willingness of the 
people, through honest government, to make liberal contribu- 
tion for free public schools for the education of all the people. 
“This ideal condition has not always obtained in Alabama, 
but I stand here to pledge the enlightened sentiment and prop- 
erty-holding citizenship of my beloved state, as far as in their 
ability lies, to this platform, and only this, for our future 
public education.”

ARKANSAS. 
Hon. Joun H. Hrnemon. 
I have been alloted the space of ten minutes in which to 
make a report upon ike educational progress during the past 
year. I can not go inio detail, but I will offer a hurried state- 
ment of some of the general conditions. There is a great edu- 
cational awakening in the state; the Arkansas Press Associa- 
tion, the Arkansas Bar Association and various other societies 
and conventions are making the educational improvement of the 
state a regular topic for discussion at their annual sessions. Ed- 
ucational mass meetings are held in every quarter of the state. 
The leading newspapers are taking an active part in the general 
agitation for better school advantages. We are in the midst of 
a genuine educational revival. All over the state magnificent 
public school buildings are being erected. ‘Towns with a popu- 
lation of from two to three thousand are erecting school houses 
which cost from fifteen to thirty thousand dollars. The larger 
towns and cities of Arkansas have public school buildings which 
are thoroughly modern in every respect and are the equal of 
those found in any other part of the American Union. Manual 
training, domestic science and kindergarten work are in use 
in most of our best schools. Our city superintendents and town 
principals are keenly alert on all questions of educational 
progress and lose no opportunity for self-improvement and the 
general uplift of their schools. Our people are beginning to 
realize more and more that splendid buildings, modern equip- 
ments, elegant furniture and beautiful grounds are only out- 
ward tokens and that the spirit and life of the school can be 
made only by placing a first class teacher in every room in 
these magnificent buildings. The people of the state are com- 
ing to realize more and more that “the teacher is the school,” 
hence, there is a universal desire and demand that only the best- 
qualified persons obtainable shall be employed to teach in the 
public schools of the state. This has led to a general agitation 
of the question of better salaries for our teachers. There is 
hardly a city in the state which has not made a general advance 
in the pay of teachers during the last twelve months. Be it said 
to the eternal credit of the school boards that without excep- 
tion they want to pay more and will do so as soon as the money 
at their command will permit them to do so.
-P-A-G-E-61
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 61 
The standard of requirements for teachers’ certificates is 
constantly becoming higher through the faithful and fearless 
efforts of our county examiners, most of whom are men who are 
keenly conscious of the high responsibilities that rest upon them 
and who feel that it is their duty to protect children from in- 
competent teachers even though in doing so they may incur 
the displeasure of political erafters and persons who would 
pervert a sacred trust and debauch the public school by using 
it for private gain or public charity. 
In no respect has there been greater improvement during the 
last twelve months than the growing determination on the part 
of school directors to disregard partisan pleas, appeals for the 
helpless and unfortunate, and all other influences of like char- 
acter, and make personal worth and scholastic fitness the sole 
basis in the selection of teachers. There is, too, a growing dis- 
position to properly recognize the true province of the superin- 
tendent or principal in determining the educational policy of 
the schools. There was a time when, especially in the smaller 
towns, teachers were elected without consultation, conference, 
or recommendation from the principal of the school. This con- 
dition no longer exists among the more progressive and broad- 
gauged school directors who do not regard their election to 
office as an opportunity for the distrubution of a certain amount 
of patronage, but rather as the imposition of a sacred trust 
which involves the life and happiness of every child in the 
school district. 
By strenuous efforts we have succeeded in driving the chart 
venders from the children’s temple. In my state there is a 
strong and growing demand in favor of scrupulous honesty in 
public office and school directors as a rule are held to a rigid 
account of the sacred trust committed to them. 
During the last session of the legislature both houses by 
unanimous vote passed a bill providing for state aid to high 
schools which would have given every boy and girl in the 
state an opportunity for a high school education within his own 
county free of charge, but this bill, one of the best ever passed 
by any Arkansas legislature, failed to win the approval of the 
chief executive and did not become a law because it was not 
vetoed until after the final adjournment of the legislature. 
The last legislature also submitted an amendment to the state 
constitution which will permit the legislature to vote a tax not 
to exceed three mills on the dollar for general school purposes to 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
be distributed to the various counties of the state on the basis 
of scholastic population. The amendment also provides that 
school districts may vote a local tax not to exceed seven mills 
on the dollar for school purposes. All the energies of the 
friends of education in Arknasas are being united to secure 
the adoption of this amendment at the general election in Sep- 
tember, 1906. If adopted, Arkansas will take front rank 
among the states of the south in providing public education for 
all the children of the state. 
I am glad to state, too, that the people generally are coming 
to realize that teaching is a science of well-established princi- 
ples and an art of very difficult processes. More and more 
there is a demand for trained teachers as there is a demand 
for trained workers in every other department of human effort. 
I confidently believe that the next legislature will establish a 
special school for the professional training of white teachers. 
The sentiment of the people toward higher education is abun- 
dantly demonstrated by the fact that the last legislature made 
the largest appropriation ever made by any legislature of the 
state for the support of the State University. With the adoption 
of the proposed amendment to the state constitution, which will 
permit increased taxation for public school purposes, with state 
aid for high schools and the establishment of a county high 
school in every county of the state, with liberal appropriation 
for the maintenance of the State University, with the estab- 
lishment of a state normal school for the training of our teach- 
ers, and a technological school for young persons who wish to 
enter upon the mechanical arts, we confidently believe that the 
day is near at hand when Arkansas will claim first place in the 
educational work among the states of the south. These advan- 
tages coupled with her remarkable resources, her great timber 
fields, her immense beds of mineral wealth and vast areas of 
fertile soil, and her noble citizenship, will make her queen of the 
south and one of the brightest jewels in the southern constel- 
lation.

COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO 
ADVANCEMENT. 
Section 6 of Article 12 of the State Constitution reads as 
follows: “A special tax of one mill on the dollar of all tax- 
able property in the state, in addition to the other means 
provided, shall be levied and apportioned annually for the sup- 
port and maintenance of public free schools.” 
Section 8 of the same article reads as follows: ‘Each coun- 
ty shall be required to assess and collect annually for the 
support of public free schools therein, a tax of not less than 
three mills, nor more than seven mills on the dollar, of all 
taxable property in the same.” 
Section 9 of the same article reads as follows: “The coun- 
ty school fund shall consist, in addition to the tax provided in 
section 8 of this article, of the proportion of interest of the 
state school fund and of the one mill tax apportioned to the 
county; all capitation taxes collected within the county, and 
shall be disbursed by the County Board of Public Instruction 
solely for the maintenance and support of the public free 
schools.” 
Section 10 of the same article reads as follows: “The legis- 
lature may provide for the division of any county or counties 
into convenient school districts; and for the election, bi-en- 
nially, of three school trustees, who shall hold their office for 
two years, and who shall have the supervision of all the schools 
within the district; and for the levying and collection of a 
district school tax, for the exclusive use of public free schools 
within the district, whenever a majority of the qualified elect- 
ors thereof that pay a tax on real or personal property shall 
vote in favor of such levy; provided, that any tax authorized 
by this section shall not exceed three mills on the dollar, in 
any one year, of the taxable property in the district.” 
Chapter 5381, An act to provide for state aid to public 
schools in thiis state, to prescribe conditions and to make appro- 
priations therefor, Laws of 1905, appropriates $50,000 an- 
nually; Chapter 5382, “An act to define the grades of in- 
struction that shall be taught in the uniform system of public 
schools of Florida; to aid and encourage the establishment of 
public high schools and rural graded schools; to prescribe the  
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
conditions and to make appropriations therefor,’ Laws of 
1905, appropriates $50,000 annually, and Chapter 5383, “An 
act providing state aid further than the one mill school tax, 
and preseribing the duty of county school boards, their chair- 
men and the county treasurer for certain common schools 
of this state, not otherwise receiving state aid,” Laws of 
1905, appropriates annually $25,000. It will be observed 
that the appropriations under these several acts alone aggre- 
gate $125,000. The raising of this amount will require the 
assessment and collection, annually, of a tax of more than one 
mill on all of the taxable property of the state. The amount 
annually accruing to the school fund of the state under the 
latter clause of Section 9 of Article 12, as quoted above, is 
$75,905.00. The foregoing, as shown by the various consti- 
tutional and statutory provisions quoted, demonstrates the fact 
that the people in the most progressive counties in this state 
are paying a direct school tax of nearly thirteen mills on the 
dollar, more than one mill of which they have voluntarily 
placed upon themselves this year through their representatives 
in the legislature. Chapter 5204, “An act to provide for the 
certification of teachers and to prescribe requirements for the 
various grades of certificates,’ makes a third grade certificate 
valid for two years from the date of issue, good in any coun- 
ty in the state upon the endorsement of the county superin- 
tendent, and re-issuable for life; a second grade certificate 
valid for four years from date of issue, good in any county of 
the state upon the endorsement of the county superintendent, 
and re-issuable for life; and a first grade certificate valid for 
five years from date of issue, good in any county in the state 
upon the endorsement of the county superintendent, re-issuable 
for life, and, under certain conditions, valid for life without 
further examination. Now, in view of the fact that the peo- 
ple are voluntarily putting so much money into the school 
system, I take it as a matter of plain business that they ex- 
pect larger returns from such investment, and since the legis- 
lature saw fit to enlarge the scope of all grades of certificates, 
I take it that it meant for a certificate, when once obtained, 
to represent more to the holder thereof than such certificate had 
hitherto represented. Infinitely more importext to this state 
than a large financial return for the money expended by the 
people, and to the teacher than that she should hold a high grade 
certificate obtained as the result of an easy examination, is
-P-A-G-E-65
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 65 
the fact that the person who attempts to instruct children shall 
be competent to do the work which she undertakes. I have 
felt that it was perhaps necessary to say this much in defense 
of recent examinations about which a few complaints have 
come to my attention, and in defense of others which may be 
held in the future. I wish to state, for the information of 
the public, that the high standard attained in the state of 
Florida under former administrations shall not be lowered, 
but on the contrary, the school system as hitherto established 
shall be enlarged and strengthened. 
THE PRINCIPAL OF A SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL MUST HOLD A STATE 
CERTIFICATE. 
Division C of the regulations of the State Board of Edu- 
cation says: “That state aid will not be granted to any 
school unless every teacher therein holds a legal and unexpired 
certificate issued in Florida; the certificate of a principal of 
a high school must be of such grade as to show that he, himself, 
is qualified to teach any subject in the high school course of 
study; and the principal of a rural graded school shall be 
required to hold at least a first grade certificate.” A first 
grade certificate shows that the holder thereof has, in addition 
to the nine common branches, passed a satisfactory examina- 
tion in algebra, physical geography and civil government, 
while in the senior high school course there are required to 
be taught geometry, trigonometry, Latin, general history, 
physies and zoology. The State Board of education has, 
therefore, very properly decided that the principal of a senior 
high school shall be required to hold a state certificate in order 
that he may be pronounced competent to do the work required 
of him. But this regulation does not go into effect until the 
first of July, 1906; hence, all applicants will have ample time 
in which to prepare for the examination for this certificate. 
It is the intention of the State Board of Education, as soon as 
the educational conditions in this state will permit, to have 
the regulation apply also to the principals of junior high 
schools. 
PRIMARY CERTIFICATES. 
Section 8 of Chapter 5204 reads as follows: “That a pri- 
mary certificate may be issued by the state superintendent to 
any eligible applicant who shall furnish satisfactory testimo- 
nials as to peculiar fitness for primary teaching, and who shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
66 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
have made a grade of 80 per cent. in such oral and written ex- 
amination on primary studies and methods as may be pre- 
scribed by the state superintendent, with such assistants as he 
may select. Primary certificates shall be valid for four years 
from the date of issue, except as provided in Section 18 of this 
Act, and shall be valid only for teaching in the first, second 
and third grades of the primary departments of regularly 
graded schools or in public kindergartens.” After four years 
of successful teaching under a primary certificate, the state 
superintendent may make it valid during the life of the holder 
without further examination. I am urging upon all primary 
teachers who do not hold this certificate the importance of 
taking the examination for such certificates at the earliest 
moment practicable, and I announce for the information of 
such as may become applicants for this grade of certificate 
that those who do not hold an unexpired first or second grade 
certificate, obtained under the uniform examination, will be 
required to pass a written examination consisting of not less 
than five questions, which shall be the equivalent of the ques- 
tions submitted in the uniform examination for second grade 
certificates, on arithmetic, English grammar, geography, his- 
tory and composition. No applicant for a primary certifi- 
cate, it makes no difference what grade of an unexpired certifi- 
cate she may hold, will be exempt from a written examination 
in methods and principles. This examination will consist of 
ten questions so framed as that the answers to the same will 
show the applicant’s knowledge of the theory and art of edu- 
cation, especially as they relate to primary work. In addi- 
tion to the written examination, each applicant will be re- 
quired to undergo an oral examination in the presence of the 
examiners, giving three lessons on subjects taught in the pri- 
mary department, and outlining and developing her method 
of teaching each subject. An opportunity for taking this 
examination will be given each year at the close of the Florida 
Educational Association, and also at the close of the Teachers’ 
Summer Training School. On account of the great impor- 
tance of primary work and the strong demand for primary 
teachers in the state, it is again recommended that every avail- 
able applicant take this examination at the first opportunity. 
THE REVISION OF THE STANDARD COURSE OF STUDY. 
At the time of the preparation and adoption of the present 
Standard Course of Study, it was thought that the require-
-P-A-G-E-67
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 67 
ments of the rural graded and high schools had been fully 
met, but when it was put into operation it was found to 
be quite inadequate. specially is this true since the en- 
actment of Chapter 5384, better known as the Buckman Law. 
This law makes it incumbent upon the state institutions estab- 
lished under its provisions, to enforce certain restrictions as to 
the entrance requirements of students to the courses they offer. 
As far as possible, the Standard Course of Study for Rural 
Graded and High Schools, while having due regard to the edu- 
cation of at least 90 per cent. of the boys and girls who will 
never be so fortunate as to go to college, should conform to 
and articulate with the courses of study prescribed by the 
University of the State of Florida and by the Florida Female 
College. It is believed that such a revision of the present 
Standard Course of Study can be made as will be helpful and 
advantageous to all the boys and girls of the public schools and 
the colleges. Realizing the necessity of such a revision, an 
effort was made last summer to have it done, but Section 7 
of Chapter 5382 while it authorizes the revision, according to 
the opinion of the attorney general, does not make an appro- 
priation for the purpose of paying a commission appointed to 
make the revision, so the effort had to be abandoned for the 
time. We shall take the matter up again next summer, and 
we think the money is in sight with which to pay for having 
the work done. 
TEACHERS SUMMER TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
Section 21 of the famous Buckman Law, which for months 
has run the gauntlet of public opinion, and has but recently 
stood the test of the Supreme Court, reads as follows: “That 
all Summer Schools now or that may be hereafter provided for, 
shall be taught, had and held in and at the University of the 
State of Florida, and the Board of Control shall make such 
necessary provisions therefor as shall be requisite or necessary ; 
provided, That whenever a Normal Department shall be estab- 
lished at the Female College, a branch of such Summer School 
may be there located if deemed advisable, and the boards may 
establish a Summer School for colored teachers at the colored 
Normal School whenever they shall deem the same necessary.” 
Under the section quoted, there was established at Gaines- 
ville last summer a permanent Summer Training School for 
white teachers with a corps of nine professionally trained in-
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
structors. In this school an opportunity will be given for 
applicants to prepare for all grades of certificates issued under 
the law. Under the same section, there was established at the 
colored Normal School, located at Tallahassee, a similar school 
for the training of colored teachers. On account of greater 
convenience, from a geographical point of view, the Boards are 
contemplating the establishment of a branch of the Summer 
Training School for white teachers at the female college lo- 
cated at Tallahassee. 
Our school system, while it is far from being perfect, yet 
as a whole is quite satisfactory. Chapters 5381 and 5383, 
by the legislature of 1905, were intended to make better pro- 
vision for the primary and intermediate schools, while Chap- 
ter 5382 was enacted with a view to bettering the condition of 
the rural graded and high schools, and Chapter 5384, the 
Buckman Law, had for its exclusive object the raising of the 
standard and the general improvement of the colleges of the 
state. 
In conclusion I wish to beg your pardon for not having 
mentioned other phases of the school work, and for having 
mentioned in only a desultory way those to which I have 
called your attention, but a lack of time has not permitted me 
to do more. I wish to say that the outlook for public educa- 
tion in Florida is most encouraging. The people are rapidly 
realizing that if their children are to be educated they must 
be properly taught, and to be properly taught they must have 
competent teachers, and if competent teachers are employed 
they must be paid.

by the same plans and methods and with the same heroic 
courage. The educational conditions and the efforts to pro- 
vide educational advantages for all the children of our South- 
land have in the several Southern States been very similar, 
especially during the past forty years. At present we are 
fighting the same batiles, and the discussions of this Associa- 
tion and our other opportunities of conferring with one an- 
other upon educational matters make the victories of one the 
battle ery of all. 
“Facts About Southern Educational Progress,” compiled by 
Mr. Chas. L. Coon of Raleigh, N. C., is a most interesting 
and inspiring little volume. We see that among the South- 
ern States Georgia stands sixth in order as to amount of school 
fund in 1903, the amount appropriated for each child being 
$3.24; for 1904 our school fund, local and state, was about 
$3.37 for each child of school age. The amount raised by 
local taxation in 1904 was $660,720.00, an amount far in 
excess of that raised in any year before. The indications are 
that this amount will be materially increased during 1905. 
We see by Mr. Coon’s comparative statistics that Georgia 
ranks third among the Southern States in school attendance, 
her average being 82 per cent. Just here I have an inter- 
esting fact to report in regard to attendance. In Hancock 
County the experiment has been tried of operating the rural 
schools for nine months during the year. It was the general 
opinion that the attendance in the schools would not be kept 
up during the long term. The experiment has shown that in 
every school in the county except two the average attendance 
was higher during each of the nine months than it had been 
during the short term of five months of previous years. 
An increase of $5.00 or $10.00 per bale for cotton brings 
an increased volume of curreney into the South. I am pleased 
to state that our schools are enjoying a large share of our pros- 
perity. The building of school houses is going steadily for- 
ward in the rural districts. The number of substantial school 
houses built, costing from $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 for graded 
and high schools in our towns has been more than usual dur- 
ing the past year. From an authentic source I have an esti- 
mate that within the last three months the schools of Georgia 
have bought 10,000 new desks, one county alone ordering 
1,000. I have been impressed as never before with the fact 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
that a new school building brings not only comfort to the 
pupils, but renewed interest to both pupils and patrons. The 
attendance and interest in school work is always better in a 
well equipped and attractive building. Indeed, one of our 
County Superintendents informed me that in contests among 
the pupils of his county the prizes and medals are almost in- 
variably won by pupils who attend school in houses that are 
painted, well lighted and furnished with comfortable seats. 
In 1904, 247 new school houses were built at a cost of $263,- 
671.00. Of this number 231 were built in the villages and 
rural districts at a cost of $127,721.00, and 16 ‘in the cities 
and larger towns at a cost of $135,950.00. The tendency on 
the part of boards of education is to encourage the building 
of those school houses only that conform to the demands of 
modern educational ideas. 
By the reason of the consolidation of schools in many coun- 
ties and of the abandoning of school houses that were not suit- 
able for school purposes, the net gain in the number of schooi 
houses in 1904 was only 108. In some of the rural districts 
in Georgia a few schools have been ‘taught in churches or in 
other buildings not intended for school purposes. The same 
causes that lead to the abandoning of many of the unsuitable 
and unsightly school buildings that have been in use, have 
lead also to the discontinuing of schools that have been taught 
in buildings other than school houses. The decrease in the 
number of schools in 1904 was 126. It must be noted, how- 
ever, that although there was a decrease in the number of 
schools, there was an increase in the attendance over the at- 
tendance of the preceding year. 
The demand for trained teachers, especially for trained male 
teachers, is increasing. In 1903 there were 2,716 normal 
trained teachers in Georgia, and in 1904 there were 3,279; an 
increase of 563 in one year. The increase in salaries has not 
kept pace with the increase in demand for teachers, although 
there has been a slight increase in the matter of salaries. 
There is one disadvantage which our prosperity brings to the 
schools. Other lines of business offer attractive salaries to 
our teachers and have drawn a few of them away from the 
schoolroom. The patrons are showing their appreciation of 
the teachers’ work by increasing their salaries by subscription, 
tuition and local taxation. 
Years ago the framers of our state constitution made easy
-P-A-G-E-71
  < 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 71 
provision for local taxation in our towns and cities which 
have excellent school systems. In counties the conditions 
were hard and no provision was made for local taxation in 
rural school districts. About one year ago the people ratified. 
an amendment to the constitution which permits counties and 
school districts to levy a local tax if two-thirds of the votes 
east are favorable. During the last session of the general 
assembly the latter part of August, 1905, our general essembly 
enacted a general law for local taxation in counties or school 
districts. .The question of local taxation is now first in the 
minds and hearts of our people and we are having an educa- 
tional revival. 
Under the local taxation law enacted at the last session of 
our General Assembly, there has been an increase in the number 
of pupils within reach of long term schools supported in part 
by a local tax. Over twenty school districts have voted a 
local tax since the adjournment of the General Assembly. In 
addition to these, two counties have voted a local school tax, 
and several others will vote on this question during the next 
month. By the census of 1903 the counties of Hancock and 
Fulton, which have voted a local tax for the entire county, 
except for several cities and towns that already had local tax- 
ation, showed 13,494 children of school age. As the popula- 
tion has increased since the census was taken it is safe to esti- 
mate that. in these two counties alone better school facilities 
will be offered during 1906 to about 15,000 children. In 
Fulton county election there were only 57 votes against local 
tax for schools. 
Our city schools are rapidly introducing manual training 
into the curriculum, and the reported results are good. A few 
of our progressive village and rural schools have introduced 
a good course of manual training. One of the best reports 
on this branch of work is from Supt. M. L. Duggan of Han- 
cock County. A statement of this excellent work is published 
in my annual report for 1904. A skilled teacher gives instruc- 
tion to all the teachers of the county and the work is carried 
on in all the schools with enthusiasm. Objection on the part 
of parents to the children taking manual training in the schools 
is rare. We are introducing the subject of Agriculture into 
both city and rural schools, and I find an absorbing interest 
on the part of pupils and parents in the subject. 
The observance of Arbor Day and the work of the School 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  vb 3 SoutwHERN EpuCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Improvement Clubs have served as an entering wedge in the 
work of introducing agriculture in the schools. School Im- 
provement Olubs have done a good work in beautifying school 
grounds and buildings. In one county last year the children 
planted over 20,000 trees, vines and plants during Arbor Day 
season. As Georgia is essentially an agricultural state, this 
movement to interest our youth in plants and soils and all 
kinds of vegetable and animal growth is most imnortant and 
far-reaching in its significance. 
We are establishing school libraries rapidly. Our County 
School Commissioners have taken definite steps in this by de- 
claring themselves heartily in support of such work, and a 
Committee of Superintendents prepared a list of about 350 li- 
brary books, arranged according to subjects and grades. On 
these books we have secured special prices. This Library List 
has received favorable criticism from the people and the press. 
I shall be glad to give copies of the Library List to those who 
wish to see it. 
For several years our school officials have been striving with 
more or less success to consolidate rural schools. Their efforts 
have been greatly strengthened by the recent law, which re- 
quires that school districts be sixteen square miles in area 
unless natural causes prevent. In a very few counties the 
area of school districts would average not more than eight 
square miles. The average for the state has been 12.6 square 
miles. I believe without exception consolidation of schools 
has proven satisfactory wherever it has been tried. 
We are raising our standards of teaching. Our normal 
schools are overflowing; our University Summer School is an 
assured success. We have but to give our teachers an invita- 
tion and they quickly avail themselves of every opportunity to 
improve themselves. 
A State Educational Journal has recently been established. 
The main object of this periodical is to aid in unifying the 
state work by bringing the school work of all parts of the 
state to the notice of all teachers, and to faithfully record the 
history and progress of educational movements in Georgia. 
The sentiment of the people is indicated by the newspapers 
of the state. Georgia has more than 100 weekly papers and 
numerous dailies, and each and every one of these papers 
record in almost every issue some educational news. The 
most skeptical must be convinced of the real interest and even
-P-A-G-E-73
  $ EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 73 
enthusiasm in school affairs if they read our papers. The 
following is taken from the Vienna News of Nov. 7, 1905: 
“The only way for the rural districts to have as good pub- 
lic schools as the towns and cities is by local taxation. 
“The country boy and girl are just as deserving of this ad- 
vantage as those of the cities and their parents should give 
it to them. 
“With local taxation, good teachers and buildings can be 
had, and without it they never will be what they ought to be. 
With such a system of public schools in our rural districts, 
farm lands would increase in value more than enough to pay 
the small pittance of tax, and families would remain on the 
farm to school their children instead of moving to town. 
“Let the parents of Dooly move upward and provide this 
inestimable opportunity for their children, and thereby make 
farm life more attractive. You can do it if you will only 
make the effort.” 
The state agent of the University of Georgia, Prof. J. S. 
Stewart, is doing valuable service to the cause of education. 
He is giving valuable aid to educational efforts throughout the 
state. While he is especially engaged at this time in system- 
atizing the high school work of the state, he is helping to make 
wholesome sentiment in favor of agricultural education, rural 
high schools, local taxation, libraries, ete. 
These are a few of the indications of our progress very 
briefly and inadequately told because of lack of time. 
In conclusion allow me to say that I earnestly hope that 
all our Southern States will co-operate with Georgia in a great 
educational exhibit in the proposed Industrial Exposition to 
be held in Atlanta in 1910. Exhibits of school work at our 
county contests in oratory and other branches of school work, 
and in our county and state fairs, have never failed to arouse 
great interests and renewed zeal in students and teachers. I 
cordially invite you to bring exhibits of your school work from 
kindergarten to college, and place them in the educational 
exhibit we will have in Atlanta in 1910.

KENTUCKY. 
Hon. J. H. Fuqua, 
In the past year some progress has been made in public 
education in Kentucky. Quite a number of graded schools 
have been established in the small towns and country districts, 
and the state appropriation has been supplemented by funds 
from local taxation sufficient to meet and equip suitable build- 
ings, and to extend the school terms to nine and ten months. 
The schools in the rural districts have been lenethened one 
month, and they are now required by law to be taught six 
months instead of five. The county superintendents report 
that the attendance at schools has increased at least 20 per cent. 
over any previous year. It is noticeable that the apathy and 
indifference of parents in regard to keeping their children in 
school, which has prevailed so long, is giving way, and more 
interest is manifested by them for longer terms and more effi- 
cient teachers. The demand for more thorough and better 
equipped teachers is increasing, and a strong and, I hope, a suc- 
cessful effort will be made during the approaching session of 
our General Assembly to establish two or more training schools 
for teachers. This is an imperative necessity, as we have no 
such schools in the state under state control. 
The apportionment by the state for public schools for the 
year ending June 30, 1904, was $1,947,165.19 arising from the 
following sources:

The amount appropriated for the school year ending June

The amount for the school year ending June 30, 1906, is 
$2,420,879.80.
-P-A-G-E-75
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 75 
The increase for the year ending June 30, 1905, over that of 
the year ending June, 30, 1904, was $211,917.23, and of the 
year ending June 30, 1906, over the preceding year was $261,- 
797.38. 
The per capita per pupil for the year ending June 30, 1904, 
was $2.60. For the year ending June 30, 1905, it was $2.95, 
and for the year ending June 30, 1906, it is $3.25. 
Tt will thus be seen that the state’s apportionment for educa- 
tional purposes is increasing more rapidly than the school pop- 
ulation. 
Realizing that something should be done to add a stimulus to 
he cause, last May I called together in Frankfort about 100 
friends of education from different settions of the state to take 
counsel together. It was the unanimous consent of those pres- 
ent that many things are necessary to make our public schools 
more efficient and better able to accomplish the task set before 
hem. Among the necessities are consolidation of weak schools, 
etter houses, grounds and equipments; longer terms, more effi- 
cient and better paid teachérs, and training schools for teachers. 
A committee was appointed to meet with the Kentucky Educa- 
ional Association in June at Mammoth Cave. The Kentucky 
Educational Association heartily approved of the suggestions 
of the committee, and the state was organized for an educa- 
ional campaign. A committee of three prominent men from 
each congressional district was appointed to organize and stir 
up the friends throughout the counties and an executive commit- 
ee of five, with headquarters at Frankfort, was appointed to 
prepare and circulate literature throughout the state, and to 
secure speakers and have addresses made in every county in 
he state. 
This work will begin soon, and we are hoping to see our peo- 
ple aroused as they never have been before. Our motto is: 
Never cease agitation until every boy and girl in the common- 
wealth shall have the means and opportunity of securing an 
educaiton that will in a measure fit him or her for a useful and 
successful life.

  MARYLAND. 
Hon. BATES STEPHENS. 
Enough has been said already to convince even the skeptical 
that public education in the states of the South has been going 
in leaps and bounds during the past decade. If there ever was 
a time in the history of the commonwealths whose educational 
matters come within the scope of the work of this Association, 
when educators and those interests of which they are the imme 
diate custodians were sleeping, certainly it is not now; for ear- 
nestness, movement, vitality and action have characterized all 
the utterances we have heard, and progress in all the essentials 
which make up a comprehensive school system has been the 
keynote of every speech which has been made at this splendid 
session. 
I am more than glad to say to you that Maryland has caught 
the spirit of this educational awakening of which we have heard 
so much today, and which is destined to sweep the “Sunny 
South ;” and I bring to you from that state the greetings and 
good wishes of more than five thousand school officials and 
teachers who are as earnest and faithful workers as were ever 
enlisted in any educational crusade. They want it under- 
stood that they have buckled on the full armor of firm resolve
-P-A-G-E-78

and resolute purpose, and there will be no flagging of interest, 
no waning of faith, no entangling alliances, no compromise 
with the enemy’s forces, and no cessation of effort until every 
gun unfriendly to a thorough and efficient school system has 
been silenced, school appropriations made sufficiently large to 
provide ample school facilities and pay capable teachers, who 
have been appropriately styled “the true guardians of the 
state,” adequate compensation and to guarantee to every child 
of school age what should be its birthright, at least a primary 
school education. 
Taking our viewpoint as a representative of her school sys- 
tem, Maryland has made history rapidly during the past two 
years. It is a true saying that the advancement of a com- 
munity in all the essential elements of growth is measured by 
the intelligence and virtue of its people and that of all the 
factors which enter into such development, the public school 
is perhaps the most important and influential. This opinion 
is more largely shared in our state than ever before. The 
year 1902 marked a distinct revival of interest in public school 
matters. During that year there was a large exodus of capable 
and experienced teachers from our ranks. Startling reports 
came from various sections of the state that leading teachers 
were leaving their school rooms and were accepting employ- 
ment with insurance companies, banking and business insti- 
tutions where compensation was far more attractive. Scarcely 
a county escaped the ravages of this influence, and hundreds of 
our best teachers entered other fields of service. Paradoxical 
as it may sound, this wholesale withdrawal of so many good 
teachers was the best thing which could have happened—a sort 
of blessing in disguise. People are educated slowly by argu- 
ment, but quickly by events. This event did what a quarter 
of a century of argument had failed to do; for school officers 
and teachers had urged the people to extend educational fa- 
cilities and perfect school work in order that the education and 
training our schools should give might meet and satisfy the 
new conditions of our civilization. By this incident they 
were quickly educated as regarded their responsibility to that 
agency which was instituted as a counterpart to our republican 
form of government and inaugurated to place useful and in- 
telligent citizenship on a higher plane of excellence. People 
were ready to act and the educational forces of the state seized 
the opportunity. The general election was approaching. A
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 79 
plank favoring better schools by pledging larger school appro- 
priations was inserted in each platform of the two leading par- 
ties, Legislative committees were appointed for the various 
counties, and candidates were asked to state their position and to 
declare what would be their attitude on this question if elected. 
A committee of eleven school officials revised and re-wrote the 
whole school law; scarcely a section thereof remained un- 
touched. It contained all that these school men thought was 
reasonable to request; and that bill was passed practically 
without amendment, receiving a large majority in each branch 
of the General Assembly, and there was not then or since even 
the semblance of a charge that its passage was brought about 
by dishonorable means or by indirect methods. 
It increased the state school appropriation 43 per cent., 
guaranteed a uniform school year for the whole state of not 
less than nine months, and made provision for the following 
features: 
1. A minimum salary of not less than three hundred dollars 
for all white teachers whose average attendance was not less 
than fifteen pupils. 
2. A system of accredited high schools with annual in- 
spection. 
3. The privilege of sca tahiig a manual training school 
and an industrial colored school in each county, with an an- 
nual appropriation of fifteen hundred dollars for each, which 
amount is not charged to the school tax. 
4, <A pension fund of $25,000 for disabled teachers who are 
sixty years old and with a teaching experience of twenty-five 
years. 
5. The establishing of three state normal schools for white 
and one for colored students under the supervision of the state 
school authorities. 
6. Protection against the dismissal of teachers except for 
cause, and the right of appeal by the teacher to the county 
school board. 
7. Minority representation on all state and county school 
boards. f 
8. A course of study based upon the recommendations of 
the reports of the committees of ten and fifteen, and many 
other beneficial features which a lack of time prevents me from 
naming. Should our next legislature pass a compulsory school 
law for the whole state, as now seems probable, the Maryland 
   
-P-A-G-E-80

school law will contain about all the fundamental requisites 
of a complete system. 
These facts are recited to show that the past year has been 
one of adjusting ourselves to these better conditions since the 
new system has been in operation, but little more than a year. 
Nearly half a million dollars more has been spent for schools 
than in any preceding year; the salaries of two thousand 
teachers have been increased; the teaching standard has been 
raised in at least one-third of the counties; the school year 
has been lengthened from seven and one-half to nine months in 
eight counties; the membership of the State Teachers’ Reading 
Circle has nearly doubled, until now about one thousand teach- 
ers of the counties are identified with this effective agency for 
professional betterment; a state school journal has been started 
with good prospects of success; manual training centers have 
been established in twenty of our twenty-three counties, and 
three counties have recently appointed supervisors of primary 
school methods to supplement the supervisory work of the 
county superintendents. 
Because of these improved conditions in school administra- 
tion made possible by larger school revenues and a healthier 
school sentiment our teachers feel more secure in their posi- 
tions, because they are in no wise dependent on political or other 
ulterior pulls for appointment or promotion; are reaching out 
toward higher ideals in education and teaching, and are happier 
than ever before.

It is difficult to make definite statements in designating ele- 
ments of progress in school work, especially when attempting 
to limit such progress to one year. In the first place, what is 
attributed to one cause may be due to many and may have had 
its origin further back in past events. Again, that which may 
appear to be progress may, on further test, prove lacking in 
elements of real progress. In other words, all educational ac- 
tivity is not progress and much substantial progress does not 
have outward signs of such character as to be readily recog- 
nized. 
Everything else equal we may logically measure progress by 
the material prosperity of a community and by the community’s
-P-A-G-E-81

willingness to contribute a due proportion of its material in- 
crease to the cause of education. For the current year, so 
far as relates to the common schools of Missouri, there is a five 
per cent, increase in state apportionment of school moneys: 
about 10 per cent. increase in assessed valuation of property 
and 6 per cent. increase in the rate of levy for school purposes. 
Combined, these give 16 2-3 per cent. increase. Considering 
the increase in enrolment in these schools 10 per cent., and the 
daily attendance 20 per cent., due to the compulsory attendance 
law enacted in 1905 which became operative last June, the per 
capita expenditure on enrolment will be somewhat larger and on 
daily attendance just a little less than last year. All this shows 
decided progress. In some communities, however, it operates 
in the other direction. Whenever the increase in enrolment 
and attendance kas been out of proportion to the increase in 
funds, the actual results of the work in the schools are disap- 
pointing. Especially is this true of some of the cities and 
towns. Many towns have been compelled to postpone an active 
enforcement of the compulsory attendance law for lack of room 
and teaching force to take care of the children. 
The extension of the public school work during the past 
year has been more in erecting new and more sanitary build- 
ings, and providing more school rooms and teachers and better 
equipment in tlie elementary graded and rural schools, than . 
it has been in raising salaries of teachers and in increasing 
length of term or in providing high school opportunities; ‘yet 
there has been perceptible increase in all of these. 
The average length of term in all the public schools of the 
state has increased from 148 days to 151 days and the average 
salary from $322 to $338. The number of first class high 
schools has increased from 45 to 62. Eighteen high schools 
have moved up from the third class to the second class. Thus 
has the number of high schools maintaining twelve units or 
more of approved work increased from 110 to 128 within the 
year. The increase in the amount of approved work in the 
smaller high schools has been in about the same ratio. 
Four consolidated districts have been formed and as many 
good high schools have been organized where none existed be- 
fore. High schools develop in Missouri. They do not spring 
into existence full grown. Progress along this line is found 
in small high schools growing into larger and better ones. 
Schools having two or more teachers and offering only a few
-P-A-G-E-82
82 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
high school subjects one year, are able to offer two years of 
high school werk the next year when they operate in harinony 
with the recommendations set forth in the revised course of 
study. Year by year the number of schools doing approved 
high school work increases. This progress is due largely to the 
work of the assistant state superintendent whose special work 
is to inspect and classify the smaller high schools of the state. 
Not many Missouri high schools have really been organized 
within the year, but there are at least fifty schools worthy to be 
put in the third class that were short of that a year ago. It is 
very encouraging to be able to show this and at the same time 
know that this progress has not been at the sacrifice of the 
work in the lower grades. Indeed, growth in the high school 
work stimulates the work in all grades below. The system is 
so articulated as to prevent top-heaviness found in other states. 
Six years ago, the state superintendent issued a course of 
study for the elementary rural and graded schools emphasiz- 
ing both practical and cultural subjects and showing how to 
attain both results. That work has been stressed in every 
possible way since. Four years ago, the library movement 
took definite form and proved to be a great help in focusing 
school sentiment in favor of systematic and aggressive work 
along new lines embracing culture and nature subjects. Two 
years ago, a law was enacted providing for the inspection and 
classification of high schools. The state department at that 
time issued a high school course of study in which were set 
forth the conditions for approval. This, coupled with the 
movement to consolidate districts, has developed the sentiment, 
well nigh unanimous, that the high school is a necessary part 
of the school work and that the good effect exerted by it upon 
the lower grades more than pays the cost of maintaining it in 
any community. 
During the year, these three separate and most effective 
movements have been correlated. The state superintendent a 
few months ago issued in one bulletin a revised course of study 
for the graded and rural schools, a revised high school curri- 
culum, including conditions upon which high school work will 
be approved, and a recommended list of library books. While 
not voluminous, it is complete and sets excellent standards of 
work to be attained. Progress made in this connection is along 
psychological and pedagogical lines more than in the number 
of schools, number of pupils, excellence of school buildings and
-P-A-G-E-83
EpUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 83 
adequate equipments. This work of the state department is 
not an initial movement. It gathers and voices the general ten- 
dencies and records the progress made. It persists in season 
and often out of season in harmonizing and unifying all parts 
of the system. 
The state superintendent believes in the doctrine that the 
greatest stimuli come from above, that our colleges, normal 
and technical schools and universities have great influence in 
determining the character of the work of the high schools and 
academies and they, in turn, exert great influence on the ele- 
mentary rural and graded schools. In harmony with this doc- 
trine, it must be considered a decided progress for the year when 
our higher institutions, more especially our state university, 
announce that they will recognize for entrance requirements 
high school courses in agriculture, horticulture and manual 
training. 
Perhaps the most conspicuous progress for the year has been 
in the expansion in the state educational institutions. Our state 
university has planned for larger and better things in every 
department. The last general assembly appropriated out of the 
state treasury for maintenance and betterments in its different 
departments $850,000. This is about three times the amount 
appropriated for the same purposes six years ago. 
The four old, established state normal schools (three for 
white and one for colored teachers have increased in capacity 
materially. |New buildings have been erected for each, old 
buildings remodeled, faculties increased and salaries raised. 
The appropriations made for these four institutions this year 
aggregate $622,000. The appropriations for the same purpose 
six years ago amounted to $132,000. 
In addition to these, the state has established two new nor- 
mal schools at Springfield and Maryville. These institutions 
will open about the first of June, 1906. The teacher makes 
the school. The efficiency of any system of schools is determin- 
ed by the character and devotion of the teaching corps. Meas- 
ured by this, Missouri has just laid the foundation for most 
substantial progress. 
The Teachers’ College at the State University has been so 
organized as to attract large patronage. It now has hundreds 
of pupils, when formerly it had only dozens. The city of St. 
Louis has established a high grade teachers’ college, erected 
and equipped one of the best buildings for that purpose in the
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
country and organized it on a high plane to provide that city 
with college-bred and specially prepared teachers for all depart- 
ments of the city school system. 
The number of state institutions maintained for training 
teachers has been increased from four to eight and the average 
daily attendance at the four older institutions has in six years 
increased from 1,357 to 2,275. Six years ago these institutions 
were in session 190 days to the year. They are now in session 
240 days. The amount of actual work with teachers and pros- 
pective teachers has grown from 25,783 days’ attendance to 
54,600 days’ attendance. Owing to changes in having sum- 
mer terms at the state normals, the character of the work is 
much better also. Many experienced teachers, college and 
academy graduates, attend these summer sessions. The attend- 
ance is also larger then. Had we the means of determining it, 
we would find an ever advancing standard of preparation in 
the teaching corps. 
Taking it all in all, it is believed that educational progress 
in the state is keeping pace with the rapid development of ma- 
terial resources. Such progress is not confined to the public 
schools and state institutions. Missouri has many high grade 
private and denominational institutions. They are well attend- 
ed and do their share of the work of building up an intelligent, 
prosperous, liberty-loving and law-abiding citizenship.

School Fund— 
Total school fund for 1905, $1,927,850.92. 
An increase of $150,226.19 over 1904. 
Local Taxation— 
Amount raised by local taxation as reported (incomplete), 
$320,510.85. 
Increase over 1904 of $105,063.60. 
This is less than the real amount, as some districts have 
not yet reported. 
Total number of local tax districts reported to date, 322. 
Total number of tax districts established November 1904, to 
November 1905, 107. 
In 92 districts reporting votes cast, 4,625 were for tax; 1,078 
against.
-P-A-G-E-85
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 85 
In 18 districts no votes were cast against tax. 
In 29 districts reporting value school property before and 
after tax—before, $18,175.00; after, $67,120.00. 
81 districts reported rate voted. 
In 10 districts it ranged from 10 cents to 22 cents. 
In 6 districts it was 25 cents. 
In 15 districts it was 30 cents. 
In 58 districts reporting no children there were 12,196. 
Thirty-one districts reported length term before and after. 
Nineteen districts reported term doubled. 
Two districts reported number increase in term already 36 
weeks, 
GENERALIZATION FROM STATISTICS ON LOCAL TAXATION. 
The idea is taking root in every section of the state, ob- 
ject lessons in local taxation being located in 78 of the 97 
counties, scattered from the eastern to the western border and 
from the northern to the southern border. Its growth in 
popularity is indicated by the large number of local tax dis- 
tricts established this year and by the large majorities cast for 
the tax. 
LOAN FUND. 
November 1904, November 1905. 
Loans made, $58,547. 
Value of old buildings, $25,581. 
Value of new buildings, $147,784. 
Number of districts aided, 180. 
Number of new buildings erected, 122. 
Number of buildings improved or enlarged, 58. 
These loans are made to the counties for districts for the 
erection of new school buildings and the improvement of old 
ones. Not more than half the value of the new buildings or of 
the repairs is loaned to any district. The loans are payable 
in ten annual installments and draw four per cent. interest, 
payable annually. The loan fund was established in 1903. 
To date, $180,793.00 have been loaned and new buildings 
valued at $482,541.00 have been erected with the aid of this 
fund. This loan fund is a permanent building fund, increas- 
ing at the rate of four per cent. a year, one-tenth of the fund, 
the interest being available each year. This fund will be 
increased annually also by the proceeds of all sales of swamp 
lands. These sales during the past two years have amounted
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
to about $20,000.00. Many other new buildings have been 
erected without aid from the loan fund, as will appear from 
the number of new houses built. 
HOUSES. 
Number of new houses reported built in 1905, 438, an 
increase of 94 over last year. The average cost of the houses 
built this year is: White, $414.57; colored, $232.73. Dur- 
ing the past four years more than 1,200 new school 
houses have been built. These houses are built in accordance 
with plans adopted and sent out from the office of the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. The plans conform to 
modern principles of school architecture as to light, ventila- 
tion, etc. There is continual growth in public demand for bet- 
ter houses and more of them. The applications for loans are 
limited only by the available funds. At the present rate of 
increase through the aid of the loan fund and local taxation, 
it ought to be possible to have a comfortable modern public 
school house within reach of every child in the state within a 
few years.   
RURAL LIBRARIES. 
New libraries established during the year, 289. 
Supplementary libraries established during the year, 142.. 
Amount expended, $10,800. 
Number of volumes, 30,000. 
Total libraries in the state, 1,203. 
Total amount expended, $40,000. 
Total number of volumes, 100,000. 
Only 500 new libraries are available during each period of 
two years. The rural library act was passed in 1901. Per- 
sistent efforts were required to get the districts to take the 
available number during the first several years. The number 
of new libraries available to each county is limited to six. 
Now in most counties no effort is required to get the libraries 
taken and the demand is for more libraries than the law pro- 
vides for. In a number of counties many libraries have been 
established by private subscription without state aid. At the 
present rate of increase and the growth in popularity of the 
rural library movement, it ought to be possible to have a rural 
library in every public school within the next ten or fifteen 
years. The books for these libraries must be selected from a 
list prepared and approved by the State Superintendent of
-P-A-G-E-87
  EpucaTIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 87 
Public Instruction and sent out in pamphlet form. A record 
book is furnished to every library by the state superintend- 
ent and annual reports to his office are required. 
In addition to the progress of the year in local taxation, 
improvement of public school houses, rural libraries, as indi- 
cated by the above statistics, there has been marked improve- 
ment in county supervision, the salary of county superin- 
tendents has been increased, all county superintendents are 
required to spend a reasonable time in visiting their schools 
and are devoting more time than ever before to the work of 
supervision. In many counties, in fact, in nearly all of the 
larger and wealthier counties, the superintendent is giving all 
of his time to the work. The average salary of the county su- 
perintendent has been more than doubled during the past three 
years. I believe that there is continuous, safe and encouraging 
growth in public sentiment for education, in public confidence 
in schools, in public demand for better houses, better teachers, 
better supervision, longer terms and more money to supply 
these educational necessities. 
IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS. 
A number of bulletins have been issued from the office of the 
Superintendent of Public Instruction prepared carefully by 
a trained and experienced professional teacher on the teaching 
of the various subjects in the public school course. The pur- 
pose of these teachers’ bulletins has been to provide a means of 
home study for teachers desiring to improve themselves pro- 
fessionally. The bulletins have been in great demand and 
have proved very helpful. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
The county institute work has been reorganized under an 
amendment to the school law. The appropriation for this work 
has been increased. The work has been systematized. A con- 
tinuous and progressive course of study to be pursued in the 
institute has been arranged and issued in bulletin form and 
placed in the hands of the ‘teachers. The institutes are con- 
ducted by trained and professional teachers. 
COURSE OF STUDY AND GRADATION. 
A full and complete course of study for the first seven 
grades has been prepared and issued in bulletin form. This 
bulletin has been placed in the hands of every public school
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 SouTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
teacher. County superintendents have been requiring the 
gradation of the work in the schools in accordance with this 
course of study. It is hoped that the work of the public schools 
throughout the entire state will be systematized and graded in 
a short while. 
NORTH CAROLINA DAY. 
North Carolina Day is growing in popularity and has been 
more generally celebrated this year than ever before. Thirty 
thousand copies of the pamphlet containing the program have 
been distributed. The celebration of this day in the public 
schools is proving very successful in cultivating a proper North 
Carolina spirit and in arousing an interest in the study of 
state history. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Hon. O. B. Martin, State Superintendent of South Carolina. 
I received several admonitions from the officers of this 
Association that my report should be brief. In fact, when 
the last notice and program were received I said: It shall be 
as brief as the marriage ceremony of a certain magistrate in 
my State. The whole procedure is as follows: ‘“Have’r? 
Yes. Have’m? Yes. Married—$2.” However, it is im- 
possible to give any adequate idea of educational progress in 
quite so few words. One is so gratified at every symptom and 
evidence of educational growth and development, that he is 
tempted .to make a detailed report. He finds himself somewhat 
in the position of the young lady who sat upon the portico with 
her lover, on a beautiful starlit night in summer. He claimed 
a kiss for every falling meteor and shooting star. This did 
all right until she began to mistake the swinging of the lanterns 
at the railroad station for meteors, and until she claimed that 
every lightning bug was a falling star. So in our work we 
feel that every educational light in whatever remote district 
of darkest ignorance, is a meteor and a beacon leading on to 
better things. It is understood, ladies and gentlemen, that 
these state superintendents who hold the boards this morning 
are reflectors of the educational light which gleams from every 
part of our beloved Southland. 
In a brief report of a County Superintendent a few days 
ago, I received an epitome which I wish to commend to every 
school official whose duty it is to supervise, to encourage and
-P-A-G-E-89
  
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 89 
to develop. This Superintendent has 128 schools under his 
care. He reported: “* * * We have erected seven new 
buildings, two of which cost $12,000 each. In these districts 
we floated bonds. We have repaired and refurnished many of 
our old buildings and made improvements on the grounds. In 
eleven districts we voted extra levies, and we have several 
other districts about ready to do likewise. * * * We had 
seventy-five trustees at the last meeting of our Trustees’ As- 
sociation. We have two Teachers’ Associations that are active. 
We established thirty libraries and increased six of those es- 
tablished last year. In fact, we have made some material im- 
provement in every district.” 
The last statement to me is very significant. There is not 
a dormant school in all the confines of that great county. In 
every community there is growth and advancement. This 
should be a normal condition. A school should be a living 
organization. It must grow or it will decay and die. 
A few statistics will give an idea of our work in South Caro- 
lina during the past year. We enrolled 10,000 more children 
than we did the year before. Our total enrolment is now 
302,000. Our total receipts were $1,680,000, a gain of more 
than $100,000. Nearly a quarter of a million was raised by 
extra taxes. Forty-six additional districts voted levies this 
year. We have established more than 600 libraries during 
the past eighteen months. During the past scholastic year our 
white schools increased the average length of session from 23.9 
to 27 weeks. The negro schools increased from 14 to 16 weeks. 
We built more than 200 buildings, some of which were ex- 
cellent. The average salary of white teachers increased from 
$226 per year to $233 per year. Three thousand four 
hundred of our teachers attended summer schools and worked 
for self improvement. We have recently planned a Teachers’ 
Reading Circle Course, and it is being read by County Associa- 
tions and town and city classes, as well as by numerous indi- 
viduals.. The enrolment in every college increased this year, 
and we have several instances of corresponding increase in 
resources and facilities. In fact, I might go on at length in a 
recitation of evidences of progress, but I was warned to be 
brief. If I should continue, I should remind you of the young 
man’s dream. He dreamt that he ascended to heaven on a 
ladder, but that at every rung he must take a piece of chalk 
and write on the wall the name of a sin which had been for-
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 SouTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
given. He climbed until he thought he must be near the pearly 
gates, when he met his father, who had been dead for forty 
years. He asked his father what was the matter and why he 
came down. The reply was, “More chalk.” I cannot con- 
tinue without more talk, more time and more patience. 
TENNESSEE. 
Hon. ‘Seymour A. Mynpers, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
The program calls for a report of the progress of schools 
in Tennessee for the current year. As the statistics for the 
annual report are now being compiled in the Department of 
Public. Instruction, and the work is not far enough advanced 
to give accurate figures for this year, I have deemed it advis- 
able to report in a general way for the year 1905, and to give 
accurate statistics for the year 1904. 
Particular attention has been paid the past two years to a 
campaign for education among the people of the state. The 
points urged in this campaign have been better teachers, better 
attendance, increased rate of taxation, better buildings, and 
consolidation and grading of the district schools. In this cam- 
paign men of all professions have aided. It has been efficiently 
led by Prof. Claxton, and by the Southern, Educational Board. 
I attribute the improvements which I shall report largely to 
the success of this campaign. 
The year 1903 showed an average term of the rural schools 
of the state of 93 days; the year 1904 showed 103 days and 
I am satisfied that the report now being compiled for the year 
ending 1905 will show at least 117 days. 
An act of the legislature of 1903 sought to consolidate the 
weak schools by the passage of an act prohibiting directors 
from maintaining a school with under 70 scholastic population, 
except where pupils would have to walk over two and one-half 
miles or where there are natural barriers. Much difficulty was 
experienced in enforcing the law but it is gradually becoming 
more popular and directors are beginning to observe it more 
closely. 
As a result of the act, I estimate that over 1,000 schools 
have been consolidated. 
The enrollment of the schools has been increased about 
50,000; the increased interest and confidence in our public 
school system is best shown-from the fact that in 1902 there
-P-A-G-E-91
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 91 
were only 7,852 pupils enrolled in the eighth grade and above. 
In 1904 there were enrolled in these grades 16,014, or an in- 
crease of over 103 per cent. ‘The report of the present year 
will show over 20,000. ‘The report of 1902 shows 829 certifi- 
cates issued to pupils completing the secondary schools while 
the report for the year 1904 shows 1,774. The new report 
will show over 2,000. 
The great problem of public schools in the south is that of 
more money. We have made decided advance in this direction, 
but have not yet reached the point where we have sufficient 
funds to properly maintain the schools. The state has increased 
its appropriation $300,000 a year with a provision that $50,- 
000 be used to help counties unable to run their schools six 
months without it. This increase on the part of the state was 
met by an increase from counties and municipalities of $376,- 
023.29, and I believe that we will show this year a still great- 
er increase from the latter sources. In the year 1904 nearly 
$500,000 was spent for new buildings, mostly in the country 
districts. ’ 
We have been making a.special effort to improve the efficien- 
ey of our teaching force and while we have no compulsory law 
for institute attendance, we had the past summer about 80 
per cent. of our teachers in institutes and summer schools. 
County Superintendents were instructed to exercise special 
care in examining and licensing teachers and as a result about 
1,200 former teachers were refused certificates. 
We are now confronted with a different problem of securing 
sufficient teachers for the rural schools. We are trying to solve 
this problem in part by the establishment of county high schools. 
Eleven counties have recently made provision for such schools 
and a large number of counties now have the matter under ad- 
visement. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
Hon. Tuos. C. Mitter, West Virginia. 
In some tables of comparative statistics issued from the De- 
partment of Schools in West Virginia each year some interes- 
ting facts are presented. From the time the public school 
system was established there has been a gradual growth, but 
within recent years the progress has been much more rapid. 
Last year 7,597 teachers were employed, the enumeration of 
school youth was 332,862, and the total amount expended for 
   
-P-A-G-E-92
92 SouruERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
all educational purposes was $3,258,224, being $9.79 per capita 
based upon the government’s estimate of the state’s population 
of school youth, and $3.06 per capita of the total population, 
in 1903. It will be remembered that the average expenditure 
in the United States was $3.15 per capita for that year. 
At this time it may be said that the most encouraging feat- 
ure of our educational work is an awakened public sentiment 
with respect to school affairs generally. This is manifested 
in many places in larger salaries for teachers, in a lengthened 
school term, in better school buildings and better school equip- 
ment. While, of course, these physical conditions do not, of 
themselves, make good schools, they contribute very largely to 
that end, and I am pleased to report very decided progress in 
this respect. Within the last two years there have been com- 
pleted, or there are now in process of construction, as many as 
ten school buildings, costing from $40,000 to $100,000 each, 
the average price being about $55,000. Not only are our 
towns and cities putting up better buildings, but out in country 
districts modern structures with the latest and best equipment 
are being erected. 
Our school term is yet altogether too short. While the av- 
erage for the last year is about six and one-half months, this 
average is reached by including the longer terms of the towns 
and independent districts of the state. Too large a proportion 
of our youth, probably about one-half, have only the five months 
minimum term provided by law. However, a very strong effort 
will be made before the next legislature to extend this mini- 
mum requirement to six or possibly seven months. As in- 
timated above, many of our cities and independent districts 
have eight, nine and ten months school. 
It is believed that our new revenue system will very mate- 
vially increase our school funds, and if this hope is realized 
we shall be better prepared to pay larger salaries, and have a 
longer term. 
Desiring to reach our taxpayers and leading citizens gen- 
erally, and patterning after our good friends in North Carolina, 
Virginia and Tennessee, this year we have been carrying on 
a series of educational campaigns which, I am glad to report, 
have been productive of much good. About ten weeks were 
devoted to this work, and we had with us such educational 
leaders as Hon. W. W. Stetson of Maine, Dr. A. E. Winship 
of Massachusetts, Dr. R. G. Boone of New York, Supt. O. J.  
-P-A-G-E-93
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES 93 
Kern of Illinois, and Supt. Cap E. Miller of Iowa. In ad- 
dition to these workers from a distance, we had the assistance 
of several members of our University faculty, among them the 
honored president, Dr. Purinton, whom you have heard today. 
Meetings were held in different parts of the state, the attend- 
ance varying according to the locality, but I estimate that, in- 
cluding the schools visited, about thirty thousand persons heard 
these addresses. In many places in country regions the speak- 
ers were most enthusiastically received, basket dinners being 
provided and a whole day’s program arranged for. Indeed, 
the attention and earnestness of the people living in the coun- 
try districts was one of the most delightful features of the 
campaign, and many very encouraging reports have been re- 
ceived relative to these tours in the interior of the state. 
The uniform system of examinations introduced three years 
ago has undoubtedly resulted in giving us a better class of 
teachers. The standard has been raised only gradually, and, 
while some have left the ranks because they were unable to 
reach the requirements, others have been stimulated to greater 
effort, and have thus prepared themselves for more efficient 
service in the school room. At first the new system was not so 
well received, and it required a good deal of tact and careful 
dealing with the problems presented to overcome the adverse 
sentiment, but now both teachers and patrons unite in saying 
that it has brought to us much of good. One thing that the 
new system has accomplished is worth all the effort. It has 
done away with favoritism in the granting of. certificates, 
also the possibility of purchasing the same. It is rather 
humiliating even to hint that such things were heretofore pos- 
sible, but, I suppose, you who are farther south are not with- 
out such experiences, as human nature is about the same 
everywhere. 
The attendance at the West Virginia University is steadily 
increasing, the enrolment last year exceeding eleven hundred. 
Many of these young men and women become teachers, and 
the influence of their training is felt throughout the state. 
Some of our best superintendents and principals are graduates

In some parts of the state we have a slight shortage of teachers 
this year, but it is believed that with larger salaries and longer 
terms these vacancies will not hereafter occur. 
Further encouragement is found in the fact that school 
libraries are multiplying all over the state. These are not 
confined to the towns and cities, but in the country districts 
good collections of books are found. Last year 30,000 volumes 
were added to these district libraries, and on December 8th, 
which has been designated as Library Day, when a special 
effort will be made, it is expected that this number will be 
more than doubled, which will bring the number of volumes 
up to considerably over 100,000 in the district libraries. It 
should be remembered that this does not include town and 
city school libraries, whose shelves probably now contain 
nearly 200,000 volumes. These district libraries are usually 
secured by the enterprise of the teacher. 
Another encouraging feature of our educational progress is 
a manifest desire on the part of the teachers for self-improve- 
ment. This is shown by their interest in the Reading Circle 
Course and in the Round Table work at the district insti- 
tutes. A larger number of teachers is enrolled today in the 
Reading Circles than ever before, the number reaching about 
2,500, and the interest in the Round Table meetings shows 
that the teachers are desiring better things. Our compulsory 
attendance law is also working well. 
Upon the whole, I think we have made considerable progress, 
but it has been more in the nature of foundation-building 
than of work on the superstructure. Within the next two 
ov three years I believe our educational advancement will be 
much more rapid. With this end in view we expect the next 
legislature to provide for a longer school term, a system of dis- 
trict high schools, the consolidation of country schools, and an 
adequate system of district supervision, all of which we think 
will be realized through an enlightened and progressive public 
sentiment.

THE FOURTH PROFESSION. 
PRESIDENT JAMES E. AMENT, State Normal School, Warrensburg, Mo. 
To one who views the world from a teleological standpoint, 
there is an ultimate purpose in every existing fact. The ulti- 
mate, evolutionary purpose of the imposition of labor upon 
mankind is the more complete development of the individual 
to the point where he recognizes the ego with sufficient differ- 
entiation to perpetuate that differentiation and maintain in- 
dividuality in a state of existence where labor in its present 
form is absent and the limitations of animal existence are re- 
moved. <A passive existence for humanity would mean a static 
existence. Man rises to the dignity of his sphere through 
mastery of Nature’s laws, and his interest in, and consequent 
mastery of, these laws is a corollary of the necessity of labor. 
But labor has its immediate as well as its ultimate purpose, 
and the mass of the world’s workers, unconscious of teleological 
purpose, labor for immediate ends alone. We may, without 
reference to primal substance, think of work as creative energy, 
and the immediate object of man’s labor as the creations of his 
directed energy. Such is productive labor, and the labor of 
primitive man first took this form in its simplest phase; the 
object of every worker was food, which doubtless had to be 
produced directly and wholly by each grown individual for 
himself. The principle of the division of labor, which makes 
the broad distinction of directly-productive and indirectly- 
productive labor, was unknown; and if known, could not have 
been applied for want of a system of exchange, however crude. 
Nothing but dire necessity could have changed this primitive 
condition and purpose of labor. The idea of service has been 
of slow growth. Originally each tub had to stand solely upon 
its own bottom. Generally a man could get done for himself 
only what he was able to do himself; but even in his pristine 
vigor, his body was a prey to disease, which occasionally ren- 
dered him unable to do for himself. His necessity gradually 
developed the physician, whose differentiation, however, as a 
specialist in the world’s work was painfully slow. The history 
of medicine contains many a chapter of darkest superstition, 
and much of the better part of it, were it not so serious, would 
be little more laughable. Multiplied efforts gradually dis- 
closed some of the principles that underlie the physician’s work, 
and his knowledge became so ordered and arranged that he  
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
could lay fair claim to its constituting a science. He has, how- 
ever, by no means reached the Mount Sinai of his profession 
where he will receive laws from on high; yet he stands out 
among the world’s workers, today, a specialist, constituting 
with his co-workers a learned profession. 
It may be noted that the physician’s work sprang out of a 
necessity universally felt, for any man is liable to sickness and 
to the need of the physician’s service. Some work can be per- 
formed by anybody passably well, but the knowledge required 
for the physician’s work gradually grew and became differ- 
entiated to that degree that it required special application for 
its mastery. Slowly through the ages this requirement in- 
creased, as the underlying principles of medicine disclosed 
themselves, and the knowledge of the profession took on system, 
and made rightful claim to be dignified by the name of 
science. Speaking in very general terms, its underlying prin- 
ciples are those of chemistry, physiology and psychology. 
Among the earliest universities is that of Salerno, whose chief 
business was the education of the physician for the practice of 
his profession. 
Fundamentally, man is a social being, and as he advanced in 
civilization and consequent social life, increasing complexity 
made law a necessity. It is not meant that a time came when 
the race suddenly awoke to the need of legislation and law. 
Law is a growth, coming gradually with its felt necessity. In 
the philosophy of law, it is defined as “the rational ordering of 
the peace of a human community.” This does not recognize 
law as a directly divine gift, but as a form of procedure based 
in human reason; it, therefore, finds its rational principle in 
justice. As laws multiplied and required the mastery of a 
specialized body of knowledge in order to their just application 
in all particulars, the lawyer became a necessity, and was early 
differentiated from the great body of citizens, as a specialist. 
The legal practitioners thus came to constitute a profession, and 
one of those nascent universities, that at Bologna, first outlined 
against the interesting background of the twelfth century, gave 
its energies to the teaching of law. The profession of law, like 
that of medicine, sprang from necessity, and soon required for 
its intelligent practice a body of specialized knowledge, so or- 
dered and arranged as to constitute a science. 
It is hardly necessary to show in detail that the theological 
profession had its origin and rise in the same manner as the 
other two learned professions. More subtile than they, it took
-P-A-G-E-97
Tue FourTH PROFESSION 97 
its rise from the felt necessity of a mediator between man and 
God—a universal feeling, springing from a knowledge of man’s 
dependence, his finite character, and his undying hope ever to 
approach the perfection of the Infinite. Like the other pro- 
fessions, theology founded its university among the earliest, 
and the teaching of theology was long the main business of 
the University of Paris. 
Law, Medicine, and Theology—these were the three pro- 
fessions, and for centuries all learning seemed conserved for 
this venerable trinity. No one other than those of these 
“learned” professions, seemed to require learning. No general 
necessity arose, to call into being another profession. No 
thought of general education as a practical necessity had come . 
to the world. The simple ways of obtaining a livelihood re- 
quired but small mental development. Those were not the days 
of labor-saving machinery requiring intelligence for its man- 
agement; those were not the days of steam and electricity. They 
were the days of hand labor, mostly erude—days when man’s 
knowledge of the earth itself was confined to a very limited 
area, beyond whose bounds his superstitious imagination placed 
a grotesque and unthinkable universe. Besides the professions, 
the governing classes were educated for their day; but for the 
great masses who had no part in the government, education was 
unthought of. The world was moving along on apparently 
fixed lines, that seemed to have no curves to its inhabitants; con- 
ditions appeared to be settled for all time. 
But the world-historical spirit was operative, and though 
moving spirally, was ever moving upward and onward. It was 
the age of Scholasticism—the science of mediaeval times. 
Science, as we know it, could hardly be said to exist. Yet, 
scholasticism had its ultimate purpose for good: it trained the 
minds of men in logic, and prepared the world for the dawn of 
the glorious sixteenth century. Man had spanned the world, 
and his narrow horizon had widened with his new discoveries. 
Before the dawn of another century, the world had received 
the gift of its Columbus, enjoyed its Angelo and its Raphael, 
read its Shakespeare, looked through the telescope of its 
Galileo, and heard the teachings of its Luther. Scholaticism 
was passing away, and the world was awakening to a new era. 
The experimental method of Bacon was finding acceptance, 
men were turning away from authority to freedom, and the 
voice of Comenius was heard crying in the wilderness of mys-
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 SourHERN EpuCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ticism to make straight the path of the coming school master. 
Men were beginning to doubt that in order to be a scholar it 
was necessary to think in a dead language, play fantastic tricks 
in the reasoning of mediaeval mysticism, and be like Janus of 
old, but with the fore-face asleep, and ever looking back with 
the other to the times of Pericles. Education was gradually 
spreading to all classes, and the business of instruction was 
passing from the hands of the clergy to the laity. Dead 
languages were giving way to the study of living languages, 
and the study of nature was accorded some little share of time 
—all in the hope of teaching men to live in the present and 
not in the past. 
But the need of a new profession was not yet felt in the lives 
of men. Nothing short of revolution would bring this. And 
revolution brought it, on both sides of the waters. I shall not 
pause to tell of the effect of theNapoleonie war, in arousing 
the people of Germany to listen to the dictum of Fichte, which 
resulted in the building of educational Germany; nor shall I 
more than mention how, later, France, humiliated by William, 
had her eyes opened to the need of universal education; for it 
will suffice for our purpose to note the conditions obtaining in 
our own country that resulted in the founding of the American 
free public school. 
Here upon virgin soil had been planted a new nation, a 
nation representing the rich, common blood of the best of the 
old world. The forefathers were not of the riff-raff of Europe. 
It was no easy thing in those days to come to the new world; 
those who came were men of strong mind and purpose, and in 
many instances, men of considerable learning. The sun of the 
eighteenth century had gone down in blood, to rise upon the 
morning of the nineteenth to shine in glorious effulgence upon 
the most memorable century recorded in the annals of man- 
kind. In the nations of the old world the rulers had been 
educated in accordance with their times. Here in the new 
world, all men were to be rulers, and hence all men needed to 
be educated. The old world had been aroused to the need of 
the security afforded by universal education, through suffering 
and humiliation. It was the purpose of the new to make 
“security,” in the memorable words of Horace Mann, “antedate 
danger.” Men came to know that to hand down to an ignorant 
posterity a self-government was to place in their hands a most 
dangerous plaything; hence, they came to the realization of 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
Tue FourtH PROFESSION 99 
their duty to hand down to posterity an unimpaired educational 
system—a system having wrapped within its very heart the 
leaven of growth. This idea of universal education ex- 
panded until men became conscious of its full ethical bearing. 
The inventive genius of modern times had been aroused, too, 
and the idea of the practical necessity of universal education 
was coming into the thought of the world. At last, a new 
universal need had been felt by men, the satisfying of which 
required the ministering of those of expert training, and a 
fourth profession was about to arise. 
I shall pass quickly over that period of the history of the 
building of educational America that culminated in the found- 
ing of the first normal school in the new world, pausing only 
in deference to a just requirement to say that the idea of the 
new institution had been given birth by a university. So far 
as history records, little was known in America of the normal 
school movements that had taken place on the other side of the 
world. Though a suggestion had appeared in the Massachusetts 
Magazine as early as 1789, Professor Olmsted, of Yale, in 
1817, made the first practical effort to arouse interest in the 
training of teachers, and was followed some years later by 
Professor Kingsley, of the same institution, writing in the 
North American Review. But it was not until that memorable 
3rd day of July, 1839, that the doors of the first normal school 
in America were opened, at Lexington, Massachusetts. And 
when we reflect upon what might have been the consequences 
to our republican form of government had there been no free 
schools, manned by reasonably trained teachers, to Americanize 
the heterogeneous masses poured upon our shores during the 
past century, it is not an exaggeration to say that the 3rd of 
July, 1839, is a date second only in importance in American 
history to July 4th, 1776. If you would read the most stirring 
pages in the history of the upbuilding of educational America, 
follow the growth of the normal school movement from that 
insignificant beginning. The university had its Abelard, the 
normal school had its Horace Mann. It is a matter of wonder- 
ment when we think that within the lifetime of men in this 
audience that institution, so bitterly fought, has spread to the 
uttermost bounds, not of our country alone, but of the civilized 
world. History records no other institutional growth of such 
magnitude in ‘a like period of time. 
But it is enough for our purpose to know that in the fulness 
LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-100
100 SouTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of time the normal school came, and with its advent was born 
a new profession—a fourth profession, a learned profession, 
whose right to its title is still occasionally denied, even in high 
places. And this brings us to the heart of our subject tonight. 
Our brethren of the older professions tell us that we disagree 
among ourselves, and that this is sufficient indication that we 
are not a true profession. I plead guilty as to the disagreement, 
but must remark how naive are these brethren! Do the differ- 
ent schools of medicine indicate agreement in the medical pro- 
fession? Is is not common that “doctors disagree”? Does the 
dissenting opinion, accompanying nearly every decision handed 
down by the supreme court, indicate agreement as to underlying 
principles, among the legal profession? And do the multi- 
tudinous religious sects of Christendom denote agreement in 
the theological profession? I believe that the teaching pro- 
fession is more nearly in agreement as to the underlying prin- 
ciples of its doctrine than is any one of the old professions. 
In a broad, general way, it is the business of the teaching 
profession to determine the purpose of education in general, 
to formulate courses of study, to organize and govern schools, 
and to teach. 
In discussing its purpose, I am aware that one is on the 
most debatable ground in all the field of education; for its 
purpose has ever been the crux of education. This grows out 
of the nature of education, which we can best determine 
through a comprehension of what men consider education to 
be. Rosenkranz speaks of it as the “influencing of man by man 
proposing to lead him to actualize himself through his own 
efforts.” Much narrowing of this view is essential, however, 
if we would comprehend the practical purpose of school educa- 
tion, even in its widest phases; as Barnett says, “we are warned, 
first of all, against nursing the notion that school training can 
ever be made, even in the most favored cases, final and ade- 
quate; it can only approximate to an ideal; it must be a com- 
promise at best.” 
In the Prussian National System, education is conceived as 
“the harmonious anid equable evolution of the human powers,” 
while Stein, more at length, defines it as “a method based on 
the nature of the mind, by which every power of the soul is to 
be unfolded, every crude principle of life stirred up and nour- 
ished, all one-sided culture avoided, and the impulses on which 
the strength and worth of men rest, are carefully attended to.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  
THE FourTH PROFESSION 101 
James Mill thinks the end of education to be “to render the 
individual, as much as possible, an instrument of happiness, 
first to himself, and next to other beings;” while his son, later 
on, presents a more universal notion of education, as including 
“whatever we do for ourselves, and whatever is done for us by 
others, for the express purpose of bringing us nearer to the 
perfection of our nature; in its largest acceptation, it compre- 
hends even the indirect effects produced on human character 
and on the human faculties by things of which the direct 
purposes are different; by laws, by form of government, by the 
industrial arts, by modes of social life; nay, even by physical 
facts not dependent on human will; by climate, soil and local 
position.” Wide as it is, this definition, if such it may be 
called, might be extended to include the effect of death itself, 
and the onward movement of life beyond. Mill, recognizing 
its very wide universality, narrows down to “the culture which 
each generation purposely gives to those who are to be its suc- 
cessors, in order to qualify them for at least keeping up, and, 
if possible, for raising, the improvement which has been at- 
tained.” 
Again, Matthew Arnold says, “The ideal of a general, liberal 
training is to carry us to a knowledge of ourselves and the 
world,” and Herbert Spencer declares that the purpose of 
education is “to prepare us for complete living,” while our 
own Thomas Davidson says, “Education is conscious or vol- 
untary evolution.” 
No one of these excellent and helpful conceptions can be 
actualized in school education; so the definite purpose of such 
education is still its crux, and will probably remain so to the 
end of time. Different communities, and different generations, 
would not likely agree upon what is meant by “complete 
living,” and would, therefore, not agree as to the purpose of 
education, and the relative educational values of its study- 
subjects. Davidson’s notion of education as conscious evolu- 
tion, is destined, I think, to take deeper and deeper hold upon 
advancing civilization. If we accept, in some form, Lamarck’s 
theory of appetency as ito the ultimate cause of intellectual 
evolution, from the primordial germ up to the point where man 
consciously works at his own evolution, and calls his work 
“Education,” we catch a glimpse of Mr. Davidson’s idea. But 
as “complete living” must ever change, and as the objective 
ends of “conscious evolution” must ever recede, with an ad-
-P-A-G-E-102
a ia ia ad ia i 
102 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
vancing civilization, so the purposes of education today will not 
be the purposes of tomorrow, though the ultimate end and the 
fundamental purpose will remain unchanged. It is commonly 
held by the best teachers of children that the fundamental 
purpose in education is the formation of character. To him 
who has a just appreciation of the meaning of character, it is 
evident that many forces besides those of the school enter into 
its, building, but the conception of the purpose of education as 
centering in character building, is both noble and safe, and I 
should be glad if the idea would become common to our people. 
Nevertheless it is true that what seems to constitute the best 
character today may fall short of requirements at no very 
distant period, and educational values, from this standpoint, 
would remain somewhat unstable. 
Indeed, the purpose of education, ‘and educational values, as 
ascribed to study-subjects, have always received a national 
coloring and have been varied with the times. The values will 
be justly diminished or enlarged, and the purpose broadened 
and clarified, as civilization progresses. The broadest and 
best view: of life, it seems to me, is that which sees in life a 
noble means to a nobler end. A commercial age will necessarily 
take a utilitarian view of the purpose of education, but this 
will not be destructive of the higher self, if modified by the 
consideration of life as a means. No man can here set metes 
and bounds. Finite mind can never compass the Infinite, but 
it tends ever toward the Infinite, and hence it has before it 
eternal progress, making possible and desirable everlasting life. 
The genuine scholar realizes, first of all, how infinitesimal is 
the knowledge of man, and hence his detestation of the vanity 
of the individual of small learning, yet often dubbed scholar, 
who imagines he looks out upon the world with a godlike view. 
The institutions of the world, set up as the concrete embodi- 
ment of the will of man, are founded each upon an underlying 
principle, opposition to which means the destruction of the 
institution. For instance, the underlying principle of the 
State is justice, and organized opposition. to this principle by 
the men composing a state would destroy the very semblance 
of a state; here, 'as elsewhere, the wages of sin is death. Men 
have founded the institution known as the school, that learning 
may be handed down from generation to generation, and 
progress be maintained. The fundamental principle of the 
school is progress. If the school should become untrue to its 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
THE FourtH PROFESSION 108 
underlying principle and remain stationary, unprogressive, for 
a few generations, it would become a useless institution, and 
pass out of existence. Opposition, even in small degree, to 
the underlying principle of the school always cripples it, and 
continued and determined aise -would mean death to the 
institution. 
In determining the purpose of education, schoolmen will 
ever set and reset the stake that marks our educational aim; 
varying with the onward march of civilization; guided by the 
principle of progress that underlies the institution they serve; 
never doubting that 
Through the ages one increasing purpose runs. 
It is the business of the teaching profession to formulate 
courses of study, and to do it intelligently, the purpose of 
education must be held in mind. It is evident from this and 
the nature of education that a course can never be a fixed 
quantity; it will widen or intensify with the advancing pur- 
pose of education. If we compare the course of study proposed 
by the Committee of Ten with that of the Hisleben School, pre- 
pared in 1525, or with that of Sturm, formulated a few years 
later, and seemingly with an element of permanency in it, we 
can form some conception of the increasing demands as to the 
content of education, The course of the Committee of Ten, 
strong and rich as it is, will be antiquated within the lifetime 
of some of us. In the formation of curricula, as regards con- 
tent, the teacher will ever be guided anew by the principle of 
progress as manifested in the race. But, in the arrangement 
of the subjects, he will have to be guided by the nature of mind. 
I do not know that knowledge exists anywhere in the universe 
except in a mind, and to gain knowledge, a mind must grow. 
In apperceiving, the mind brings itself to bear, by means of its 
organized structure, upon the sensuous material presented to it; 
but we must not lose sight of the other side of the act, for no 
act of apperception leaves the organized structure of the mind 
just as it was. There has been a growth, and the apperceiving 
organ is stronger and adjusted for a wider range of work than 
before. In conformity to the doctrine of apperception, the 
teacher must arrange, not the material of lessons alone, but the 
subjects of the curriculum. And to do this, requires that pro- 
found knowledge of subjects that sees their relations and inter- 
dependencies. Yea, he must be able to enter the very arcana 
of mind, and adjust subject matter to the predetermined laws  
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of mental activity. To quote Arnold Tompkins, “A course of 
study is a statement of the process of self-realization in terms 
of subject matter.” 
In this cursory manner, I have tried to indicate the laws 
that determine quantity and arrangement in school curricula. 
In passing I must say that the arrangement must exhibit a 
psychological order, which may or may not be in conformity 
to the logical order. The psychological and the logical order 
would be identical in an infinite mind; the psychological may 
identify itself with the logical order in a learned mind; but the 
logical order may not mark the path of a growing mind. 
Leaving quantity and arrangement, is there no law to deter- 
mine the kind of subject-matter to choose for a course? The 
culture epoch theory was, I believe, first suggested by Comte, 
and has since been built upon by various others. 
Herbert Spencer summarizes the doctrine in these words: 
“The education of the child must accord, both in mode and 
arrangement, with the education of mankind, as considered his- 
torically; or, in other words, the genesis of knowledge in the 
individual must follow the same course as the genesis of 
knowledge in the race.” I would not hold to this doctrine so 
tenaciously as many, especially Mr. Spencer, but I believe it is 
very suggestive in determining “educational values” and in 
the arrangement of study-subjects. It seems to me that the 
strongest analogy supporting the theory is one usually unnoticed 
by educational philosophers: I refer to Haeckel’s demon- 
stration of the practical correctness of Darwin’s theory of 
human phylogeny, by showing its agreément with human 
ontogeny. Phylogeny is the history of the evolution of organic 
tribes. Human phylogeny began with the moneron, and cul- 
minated in the human race. The moneron is the simplest 
known form of animal life; it is scarcely more than a bit of 
protoplasm endowed with feeling. Darwin theoretically traced 
this endowed life through the forms of fish, amphibian, mam- 
mal, ape, and up to man. 
Ontogeny is the history of the evolution of an individual 
organism. Human ontogeny begins with the monerula and 
culminates in the individual man. The monerula, like the 
moneron, is a simple bit of protoplasm. Haeckel, by bringing 
microscopic examination to bear upon this bit of life during 
its prenatal states, through the period of gestation, found that 
it assumed the structure of the lancelet, then of the fish, even to
-P-A-G-E-105
  Tur FouRTH PROFESSION 105 
the extent of having gills, and later took on amphibian and 
mammal forms; lastly, looked much like an ape, and then took 
on the human form. It seemed that human phylogeny was re- 
peated in human ontogeny, and that through the potency of the 
law of heredity, phylogeny is the cause of ontogeny. Untold 
ages are epitomized in the brief period of nine months. Now, 
it has seemed to me that if the law of heredity is so far-reaching 
in the physical realm, that its potency will be as never-failing 
in the realm of spirit, or mind; that is, the mental life of the 
individual, mental ontogeny, will be an epitome of mental 
phylogeny, the mind life of the race, ,or, in Mr. Spencer’s 
words, “the genesis of knowledge in the individual must follow 
the same course as the genesis of knowledge in the race.” 
Forgetting that, as untold ages can be but epitomized in the 
brief period of gestation, so untold ages of mental life can be 
but epitomized in the brief period of child life, short-sighted 
educators ride to death the culture-epoch hobby, to the lasting 
harm of children. I believe the doctrine is little more than 
suggestive. I do not think the “periods” advocated by the 
“Herbartians” are well taken. Though he did not suggest them 
for the purpose, I think those of Draper in his “Intellectual 
Development of Europe” are better suited to support an educa- 
tional theory. Taking any race, he divides their history into 
an age of credulity, an age of inquiry, of faith, of reason, and 
of decrepitude. ‘Draper never worked out the proof of his 
“Ages,” and I offer them as simply suggestive. During the 
Greeks’ age of credulity, their wisest men believed implicitly 
that God dwelt upon Mt. Olympus, and would hurl a thunder- 
bolt through the heart of any scoffer who dared attempt to scale 
its sacred heights. Mythological stories found ready and actual 
believers: the story of the dragon’s teeth, or the caprices of 
Zeus, even to his unholy love of Leda, found easy acceptance. 
It was the childhood of the race, and by the law of heredity our 
little ones find no difficulty in Santa Claus’s coming down 
through the chimney, or even in crawling through the keyhole 
with great bags of presents; and the arrival of the stork is 
perfectly natural. But, by and by, in the history of the race, 
come teachers like Socrates, with their everlasting questions, 
and an age of inquiry is on. So, too, in the ease of the child, 
his never-ending questions indicate that his age of inquiry is 
emanent. 
The parallelism need be carried no further for our purpose,
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
for it is clear that in the early life of the child is the time to 
teach him those conventional subjects whose content serves him 
later as the tools of educational acquisition. It is amazingly 
hard for a grown person to learn to read, or write, or figure. 
Apperception helps him in learning a new language, but a child 
could outstrip him even here. While superficial, yet the extent 
of a child’s field of learning needs to be, and is, as wide as the 
universe. In very truth, a course of study narrows from the 
primary school to the university, with its content deepening at 
every step, when the university student is enabled to behold 
the nexus of the universe through his conception of the uni- 
versal found in even one subject. In the very nature of things, 
a growing mind cannot be a deep mind; it cannot specialize. 
In the child’s early years, his mind, like his body, is growing 
with great rapidity. Development goes on, but becomes more 
complete in the form of special powers, somewhat later. 
Spencer points out the difference between growth and develop- 
ment, basing his remarks upon the theory of St. Hilaire, and 
illustrating by the caterpillar’s great growth without change of 
structure; while in the chrysalis state, when great structuarl 
changes are going on, growth is slow. And this is exactly so 
in mind development. 
I was amazed a few years ago to hear a professor, of more 
than national reputation, in one of our greatest universities, as- 
suring his class that genetic psychology was a distinction with- 
out a difference. The psychology of the individual, he declared, 
was psychology simply, from the cradle to the grave. He 
pointed out that the function of the stomach in man is the 
digestion of food, and this is the identical function of the 
stomach in the child. The man’s heart is to propel blood, and 
so is the child’s heart. From this analogy he declared that 
memory in the child is simply memory, just as it is in the adult. 
And so of perception, reasoning, and other mental powers. 
And now, my friends, I want to endorse most of what that 
learned doctor said. However, his trouble was that from which 
many another suffers: he did not go far enough. 
“Papa,” said a lad, “I can do something you can’t.” 
“What's that?’ asked the father. “Grow!” triumphantly 
shouted the son. And the boy was right. We may admit that 
the anatomies of the boy and man are practically identical, but 
the physiology of the two, in several important respects, differs 
in some mysterious way. The man consumes more food than 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE FouRTH PROFESSION 107 
the child, and the quantity may be multiplied, but still he can- 
not add the thousandth part of an inch to his stature. The 
essential difference in the two is that one is growing, and the 
other is not. Thus, if the physiological analogy is worth any- 
thing in the discussion, it would seem to me rather to support 
the theory of a genetic psychology. Let us fit the analogy more 
completely to psychology. I understand by human physiology 
the science of the functions of the bodily organs. Now, while 
the function of any particular organ of the child’s body is 
essentially that of the same adult organ, yet it is indisputably 
true that the totality of the functions of the child’s organs 
differs from the totality of the functions of the adult organs, in 
the general function of growth. Now, we cannot assume that 
this functional difference of growth is applicable to the body 
alone, for it is applicable to the mind as well. Analogically, 
we may legitimately speak of the anatomy of the mind as 
well as of physiological psychology. Anatomically, the mind of 
the child and of the adult may be, and certainly are, alike, but 
physiologically, that is, in functional purpose, they undoubtedly 
differ. The function of any particular mental faculty, or 
organ, to carry out the analogy, may be the same in each, as, 
for instance, memory; but I believe the totality of the mental 
functions of the two to differ, just as do the totality of the 
bodily functions, in the predominance of the element of growth. 
I may enter a college gymnasium and prepare my body by 
training to perform feats now impossible to it; but my body 
has acquired no growth; through the process of habit, it has 
acquired a facility in certain executions. So the mind of the 
adult may gain certain facilities through the same process, of 
which growth is not the marked element. We know very little 
of the spiritual, yet I feel warranted in saying that while it is 
probable that the human mind continues to grow throughout 
life, yet it is undeniably certain that its growth is slow in pro- 
portion as age advances. 
While we may comprehend the difference but imperfectly, 
yet I think there is little room to doubt that there is a difference 
between the child’s and the adult’s mind, and out of that differ- 
ence comes genetic psychology, with, however, its basic princi- 
ples identical with the basic principles of psychology in general. 
In the formation of a course of study, I submit that the 
teacher must be guided by the law of progress, by the principle © 
of apperception, by the laws of heredity as exemplified through

the principle of evolution, and by the laws of psychology in

It is the business of the teaching profession to organize and 
govern schools. The ability displayed in effecting any kind of 
organization can be relied upon here just in so far as the 
organizer realizes the purpose of the organism he desires to 
bring into existence. The business of a school is not the same 
  as that of a railroad or a department store.

THE FourtH és PROFESSION 109 
from him, and he is told that he is free to shape his own course, 
he finds he lacks ballast, judgment, and the capacity for de- 
cision. The paradoxical nature of this statement disappears 
when we think of freedom as acquired capacity, and liberty as 
opportunity. One may be governed from without, but self- 
government must come from within—a most important thing 
to consider in the schools of a republic. 
Not for a moment is the freedom of self-government in school 
to be thought of as license to do as one pleases. The rather it 
is to be thought of as the development of the will through 
ethical culture. Students in higher institutions must be led to 
‘appreciate the liberty of law through finding sweet reason- 
ableness in institutional life. Very few men who say “Thy 
kingdom come, Thy will be done,” comprehend the full mean- 
ing of what they say. These words embody the highest gen- 
eralization of universal law. Neither Kant’s Categorical Im- 
perative nor the Savior’s Golden Rule means quite so much. 
Ethics is more than the science of duty, it is the science of the 
will. If a man truly wills the good, he is good, no matter 
what mistakes he may make. We hear much about having 
morals taught in our schools: The whole school, the whole 
course, every step, is the teaching of morals, if the work is 
done by a teacher who knows the ultimate good, wills it, and 
works for it. A man may be a good blacksmith, and take a 
vacation, and still be a good blacksmith while on his vacation. 
But ‘a good man cannot take a vacation from duty and being 
good, and still be a good man while on his vacation. Morals 
in a school must permeate the school in its entire work and 
conduct. It must be ethically governed. The student is not 
educated, if he does not take up into himself the law of the 
school as his own will. I do not decry set lessons in ethics, 
given students capable of comprehending the philosophy of 
such instruction; but what I insist upon is, that the actual 
governing of the school should be the concrete embodiment of 
ethics. To govern ‘a school so, the teacher must comprehend 
the science of duty toward the ethical objects of life; he must 
know the virtue and reward growing out of that duty per- 
formed; he must be able, as occasion demands, to point out 
the temptations in relation to ethical objects, to disclose the 
nature of the vices growing out of yielding to temptation, and 
the inevitable penalty that is their sequence. Young men and 
women, not tainted by hereditary viciousness, so governed,
-P-A-G-E-110

will develop into the richest and rarest citizenship with which 
a country can be blessed. 
I trust I have made it manifest that in order wisely to or- _ 
ganize and govern a school, a teacher must possess a clear in- 
sight into the organic unity of the school; that is, he must be 
able to see and bring its differences into unity. He must 
have, in an elementary way, at least, a knowledge of the phi- 
losophy of law, and he must be well grounded in ethics; for the 
underlying principles of these subjects will control his school 
organization and government. 
Last for our consideration, yet first and greatest of the func- 
tions to be discharged by the teaching profession, is the teach- 
ing act itself—a subject far too great for the meager treatment 
it can here be accorded; for all philosophy underlies teaching; 
no knowledge is too great for him who undertakes it. 
How the mind constructs the outside world or how the out- 
side world gets into consciousness; or, what is the same thing, 
how consciousness gets into the outside world, is the riddle of 
psychology. A knife blade will cut almost anything except 
itself. ‘So mind explains almost anything except itself. In 
a sense, this is a view all too common. Consciousness in 
itself is really indefinable, because we can do nothing but 
define it in terms of itself. When we say mind can explain 
almost anything except itself, we betray a looseness of thought, 
because mind explains only itself, as read into the world. The 
limitations of finite mind are such as effectually to bar it 
from a knowledge of the noumenon. Phenomena alone can 
enter consciousness. In this sheet of paper or in a grain of 
sand, or a speck of dust, I can find an insoluble mystery; for 
what either is, in itself, I do not know. Even if modern 
science should prove the atom to be a form of force, or mo- 
tion, the mystery would be but turned around, and I should 
know no more of the noumenon than before. Holding a bar 
of iron in my hand, I pronounce it hard, cold, black and 
heavy. Yet I can imagine a being with harder nerves and 
muscles than mine, with ten thousand times my strength, who, 
as he would dent the bar of iron with his thumb, would pro- 
nounce it soft, nor would he think it heavy. With slow blood 
and cool flesh, he would think ‘the iron warm; with a slight 
difference in the motion ‘of his optic nerves, he would eall it 
yellow. While we must acknowledge the relativity of all 
knowledge, yet both the giant and I should agree that iron 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE FourTH PROFESSION iil 
is a useful metal, bearing certain relations to other forms of 
matter. Iron to him would not be so soft as putty. Through 
comparison, and knowing the same world of objects, our knowl- 
edge of iron would, after all, be identical, as we should place 
it in the same relations ‘as regards other objects in the world. 
In spite of his strength, relatively, the giant would have to 
class iron as a hard substance. Our definitions of iron would, 
doubtless, agree; that is, we should think diversity into unity, 
and that is definition. With the definition as a mental pos- 
session, we should each recognize the same matter in the world 
of objects as iron. Our minds would know alike. And this 
movement of all minds in the acquisition and use of knowledge 
is the vital thing for the teacher, for upon it as a principle is 
founded method; in fact, the inductive-deductive movement of 
mind is method. Mind moves through a series of individuals, 
sufficient in number to cancel non-essential attributes, and ar- 
vives at its general notion, under which it assumes any num- 
ber of individuals of that class. This is the analytic-synthetic 
action of mind. The general notion is the goal of the learn- 
ing mind, because it takes the form of a rule or scheme, serv- . 
ing the mind as a pattern for the construction or recognition 
of individuals—whether in the world of mathematical, phys- 
ical, biological or psychological science. This law discloses 
the truth that the teacher’s work is but half done, when the 
learner has formed, even clearly, his general notion or concept. 
He must be practiced in applying his general notion, thus 
giving him the use of knowledge, and at the same time clear, 
strengthen, and help fix his general notion. This return to 
the particular, completes the circuit of knowledge. Knowl- 
edge thus considered, without reference to its content, is an 
activity: thus the law of self-activity in learning is disclosed. 
Back of .a concept is every particular presented in the his- 
tory of the mind holding that concept, which discloses the law 
of apperception; that is, how the organized structure of the 
mind reacts upon sensuous material. Any material presented 
to the mind gets recognition only through relation to some- 
thing already known; hence the doctrine of the movement 
from the known to the unknown. In short, the law of method 
is disclosed by the law of mind; that is, it is the law of mind. 
It is the nature of the mind to think diversity into unity, and 
to bring under that unity all new diversity; that is, explain 
the new, the unknown. Method is the process, in any teach-  
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ing act, of bringing diversity into unity, thus leading the 
learner’s mind along its natural path. 
I trust I have said enough to establish the fact that there are 
definite principles governing the teaching act. 
A beneficent creator made insanity possible, for if minds 
did not swing toward it now and then in bold search of Truth, 
we should be slow in finding her. We sometimes hear men 
who ought to know better talk of a purely “professional school” 
for teachers, by which term they mean a school in which the 
common branches of the public school are not taught. Such 
a school would be anything else than professional. As well 
might a medical school say to its students, “Now, you will 
use these drugs when you get out into practice, of course, 
but it would be a waste of time and unprofessional to study 
materia medica here; we will devote our time entirely to 
physiology; let us learn how to doctor.” | Now, when the 
young physician goes out he is going to practice medicine; 
that is, he will put to the test his judgment in a given case; 
and one term of that judgment will be his knowledge of the 
chemical action of a drug, held in comparison with physiological 
function. So, the young teacher when he goes out is going to 
teach arithmetic; and he should study arithmetic from the 
professional standpoint in his normal school. A normal school 
that does not do academic work is very suggestive of the play 
of Hamlet, with the significant figure left out. Such a course 
would be fully as wise as the proceedings of the faculty of 
a theological seminary who should say to the students: “You 
do not need to study the Word, it is our business to teach you 
how to preach. Of course, you are going to preach the Word, 
but we are professional, and will teach you only how to preach.” 
So a law school could tell its students not to study law, just 
study how to practice law. 
We are aware that the teacher’s subjects have been studied 
during his common school course. But his view of them there 
was not of sufficient depth, nor from the professional stand- 
point. In the teaching act, the teacher must hold the sub- 
ject in mind as a process to be realized in the mind of the 
learner, who sees only an object to be reached. Two persons 
traverse a road; one desires simply to reach his destination, 
the other must send back directions to a friend who is to come 
the way alone. The attitude of the two will be quite different. 
If a learned profession is constituted by a class of men who
-P-A-G-E-113
Tue FourtH PR0FESSION 113 
have mastered a body of scientific knowledge, founded upon 
distinctive fundamental principles, and differentiated from the 
knowledge essential simply to the well-informed—in short, 
knowledge essential to the differentiated class that they may 
minister to ‘a universal need, then I submit that teaching is a 
learned profession. 
It would be the height of presumption for me to attempt to 
instruct this ‘audience, composed so largely of university men, 
as to what should be the nature of a university; yet I beg 
your indulgence of a closing remark, on the relation of the 
university to the work of the normal school. 
The university is a very free institution. In a sense, there 
is no settled requirement that makes ‘an instiution a university. 
A standard might be set, but the very nature of the institution 
will not permit limitations. Two very different standards 
of measurement are applied, in determining if a given institu- 
tion is of university grade. Some claim, arguing from the 
Latin significance of the word “university,” that an institution 
has a right to the name, if its curriculum embraces the entire 
field of human learning. Others, again, claim that extent 
does not make the true university, but that the validity of 
its claim rests in the depth and scope of its research into any 
given branch of human learning and investigation—that the 
term university really carries with it the idea of tracing a 
branch out into all the completeness of its universal relations. 
Historically, neither of these conceptions has any basis in the 
name of the institution. The early universities, from which 
the modern institutions took their rise, were known as Studia 
Generalia. The Studium Generale signified a school open to 
the students of all lands. The word “university,” later ap- 
plied, was a term signifying that the institution had been in- 
corporated. The added significance is a growth. 
I am inclined to consider both these conceptions of a univer- 
sity as correct, if taken in proper order. A university should be 
founded upon the second conception; that is, truth for truth’s 
sake should be its aim, and profundity and completeness should 
characterize all its work. A university that fails to develop 
new truth, and waits for it to come from the outside, is not 
discharging its function toward the people that support it. A 
university, patterned mainly after the Oxford plan, may, as 
a collection of colleges or technical schools, do valuable service, 
but not commensurate with the cost of maintaining such an
-P-A-G-E-114
114 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
institution. But a new truth discovered, may be worth a uni- 
versity’s cost of maintenance throughout time. Let the uni- 
versity be founded upon the idea of the greatest perfection 
and depth in the work it does, in the one, two or three sub- 
jects it teaches. Then let it widen toward the universality 
of knowledge, as its means will permit, without, however, low- 
ering the standard of its work in any branch it undertakes. 
The most serious drawback for our universities is insuffi- 
cient funds; for the desire, amounting almost to a craze, in 
some of them for bigness causes them to spread their meager 
funds so thin in order to secure a large faculty that they are 
forced to be content with commonplace talent in their chairs. 
The choicest intellects of earth should be found in our uni- 
versity chairs. Am I in error when I say that newly fledged 
“doctors” who have given no proof of exceptional ability in 
the world’s work, are hardly sufficiently seasoned timber for a 
university professorship? Am I in error when I say that the 
ultimate problem of intellect is to think world diversity into 
universology? If not, then I have stated the ultimate prob- 
lem of the university, and indicated the kind of minds that 
must solve it. 
In the light of what has already been said, I hardly need 
say that I believe that education is a proper subject for the 
university. In its organization it should have a place, and a 
very prominent one. The normal is a technical school. Ex- 
perimentation and investigation, in the university sense, have 
no place in it. It is its business to work along the lines of 
the tried and proved—not that it should be hostile to the new, 
but its limitations are such that research in large measure is 
without its scope. On the other hand, for the university to 
undertake the work the normal schools are doing is to fritter 
its funds away for the sake of numbers. The genuine uni- 
versity is glad to be rid of this sort of work. 
Barring, possibly, the work of Stanley Hall, at Clark Uni- 
versity, little or no real university work in education has been 
done in our country. The work at Columbia University is too 
much on the order of the normal school to measure up to the 
standard we have in mind. The departments of education in 
some of our universities are sorry affairs. They deal out a 
sort of quasi-educational philosophy, tinctured with a mild in- 
fusion of pedagogy of very doubtful value, doing on the whole 
work far inferior to that of our best normal schools. I do
-P-A-G-E-115
Tue FourtH PRoression 115 
not know what DeGarmo is doing at Cornell, but I believe, if 
his hands are not tied, ‘he will eventually create a university 
faculty of education that will accomplish work in this greatest 
and most serviceable of all departments that will measure up 
to university requirements—a faculty under whom experienced 
teachers could study with real profit—a faculty whose publica- 
tions would be sought by thinkers throughout the educational 
field. As students in such a department none but experienced 
teachers or normal graduates should be admitted. 
Of the time-honored faculties of Religion, Law, Medicine, 
and Philosophy, the first, owing to the separation of church 
and state, is ruled out of our state universities. Why may not 
a faculty of Education, independent of, though not distinct 
from, the Philosophical faculty, take its place? And can there 
be a reasonable doubt that in a great university supporting a 
strong faculty of education, men, making final preparation for 
teaching in technical schools and colleges, whether of teaching, 
law or medicine, and men, aiming for university positions or 
to become heads of great school systems, could be found by the 
hundreds enrolled under that faculty? For teaching is not 
only a learned profession; it is the profession of professions; 
for at the feet of teachers all who aspire to pass the portals 
of any profession must sit. 
In closing, may I proclaim a ringing truth to normal school 
men by quoting a stanza from the last. poem ever written by 
Oliver Wendell Holmes: 
Teacher of teachers! Yours the task, 
Noblest that noble minds can ask ; 
High up Aonia’s murmurous mount, 
To watch, to guard the sacred fount 
That feeds the stream below; 
To guide the hurrying flood that fills 
A thousand silvery rippling rills 
In ever widening flow. 
And now in my own, ‘though less polished lines, may I say 
to university teachers: 
Seekers of truth eternal! Yours the boon, 
To stand in the pure and gladsome light of noon; 
To struggle for Olympus’ sacred height 
And leave behind the gloom of darkest night, 
Enshrouding minds of men below; 
To kindle beacon-fires where gods did dwell— 
And guide the wandering souls of earth from hell— 
That all may see, and live, and know.

More efficient leaders, is the cry of the wide-awake rural 
teachers. “Why are not our educational facilities better?’ ask 
the people of these districts. ‘“Can we afford to pay the county 
superintendent more money ?” ask the politicians. In language 
most emphatic the educational forces are demanding trained 
men for this responsible position. All of these expressions 
mean something. They indicate that the idea is taking hold; 
that down in the hearts of the rural people a keen sense of 
their lack of proper educational facilities is being felt as never 
before. They signify that the responsibility will soon be fixed. 
Many of us have gone among the people of the rural districts 
and aroused them to a sense of their danger. We have made 
the comparison, and demonstrated their needs. The result is 
a general demand on the part of the great majority of these 
people for better school buildings, longer terms, and more effli- 
cient teachers. In short, they are demanding that their boys 
and girls be given a chance. The ten grades in our town and 
city schools admonish these people that they dare not place their 
children, who have had merely the advantages usually given in 
the country schools, in active competition with the town and 
city children who have had such splendid training. They 
realize that in the very nature of things the country boy cannot 
compete with the city boy. The old order of things in this 
relation is fast being reversed. The poorer classes in the 
towns and cities have a better opportunity to educate their 
children than their brothers in the rural districts. The result 
is that the rural districts are being depopulated to an alarming 
extent. Our rural people are moving to the towns in order that 
their children may have a better chance. The danger is mani- 
fest. It is no part of this paper to discuss the dangers attend- 
ing the congestion of the towns and cities. Something must 
be done. To whom shall we turn for guidance? Who is to 
“lead the people out of the wilderness?” Manifestly the 
county superintendent is the logical leader. His opportunities 
are limitless, his responsibility great, his field exhaustless. 
His mission is to respond to the little hands and earnest 
hearts reaching up into his life. 
Is the county superintendent as we find him prepared for 
this important work? Is he competent? If competent, is the

Before preparing this paper I sent the following questions to 
the State Superintendents of the Southern States: 
1. What is the maximum salary paid your county superin- 
tendents? The minimum. 
2. What per cent. of your superintendents are college grad- 
uates? What per cent. have no college training ? 
3. Does your State appoint or elect these officers ? 
4, What examination is required of a candidate for this 
office ? \ 
5. Is the county superintendent required to visit his 
schools; if so, how often ? 
6. Is the superintendent allowed to teach school while hold- 
ing office ? 
7. What in your opinion is most needed in the South to 
give us more efficient superintendents ?

In Arkansas the salary of the superintendent depends upon 
the number of applicants for license to teach. 
General average maximum salary paid county superintend- 
ents—$1,741. General average minimum salary—$262.80. 
I find that very few counties in these States pay above $1,000.

From the data at hand I find the average salary of the super- 
intendents to be less than $700. 
The answers to question 2 were not full, few of the State 
Superintendents having this data at hand. It was ascertained, 
however, from those answering that less than 50 per cent. of 
these officers have had college training; while less than 25 per 
cent. are college graduates. 
The answers to question 3 show that nearly all of the county 
superintendents are elected. 
Question 4: What examination is required of an applicant 
for this office? gives the surprising information that six States 
require no examination ; four require first grade license, and in 
one State the examination is given by the State Superintendent. 
The answers to question 5 inform us that all of these officers 
are required to visit their schools once a year, but that many 
fail to comply with this provision of the law. 
Answers to question 6 name six states that allow their super- 
intendent to teach school while holding office, while five pro- 
hibit it. 
Perhaps more interest centers in the answers to question 7— 
What, in your opinion, is most needed in the South to give us 
more efficient county superintendents? I quote the answers in 
full: Thorough normal training.—Better salaries and more 
specific requirements of county superintendents by law.—Bet- 
ter pay and better trained men.—Better salaries.—Better pay, 
and educating public opinion so that only the best qualified 
men shall be elected.—Better salaries and higher qualifications. 
—Public sentiment demanding trained men.—Sufiicient sala- 
ries to secure efficient men.—More interest on the part of par- 
ents and more efficient teachers. 
I take it that the answers to these questions will be considered 
pretty good authority relative to the demands to be met on the 
part of the county superintendent. 
They convey the information from the highest authority that 
our county superintendents as a whole are not prepared for 
their work. 
I desire to say by way of parenthesis that some counties have 
earnest, faithful, conscientious, skilled men to supervise their 
schools. We are largely indebted to these faithful workers for 
the general awakening of our rural people to a sense of their 
educational needs. Upon the whole, however, I repeat that the 
superintendent is not prepared to supervise his schools, advise

Tue CouNtY SUPERINTENDENT AND His MIssIon 119 
with his teachers, and lead his patrons. He is incompetent in 
a majority of cases because he is without the proper training. 
He is without the proper training because his opportunities for 
acquiring an education have been limited. Our State Superin- 
tendents, with peculiar unanimity, agree that we must have 
better paid and better trained men if they are to accomplish 
their mission. : 
The question that forces itself upon us is, How shall we se- 
cure the best men for this position? First, we must weed out 
the incompetent men by raising the requirements. Second, we 
must increase the salary in order that the most competent men 
will offer for the place. Third, after the salary and require- 
ments are raised, laws must be passed in consonance with the 
duties of the office, and we must see that they are enforced. As 
far as possible the office must be divorced from polities. 
We must guard against increasing the salary without raising 
the requirements. Mississippi made this mistake, and the 
result is that the same men are holding the office with increased 
salaries. This State made another mistake in not increasing 
the salary to such a figure as would secure the best talent. 
Without going into a discussion of the laws that should be 
passed, I desire in this connection to call attention to the 
imperative need of a law that will require the superintendent to 
devote his whole time to the duties of his office. In many of the 
counties of the Southern States lawyers and other professional 
men. are holding the office of county superintendent as a “side 
line.” It would indeed be a great mistake if we should con- 
tinue to allow this important office to be in the hands of men 
who in many instances are incapable in their chosen profession. 
Laws that permit this rob the office of all dignity. 
To whom shall we lock to take the initiative in arousing our 
state legislatures to the demands of this office? We must not 
forget that the ordinary as well as the extraordinary politician 
is ever ready to serve the dear people; and just here is the key 
to the solution of this problem: The people must make the de- 
mands. No thoughtful people have any patience with that 
brand of politician who says ‘“‘we will leave it in the hands of the 
people, and if they elect incompetent men to office it is none of 
our business.” This is but the demagogical way of serving a 
people. It is clearly our duty to wage an aggressive campaign 
among the people. The time is ripe. The interest our rural 
people manifest in every educational gathering, their desire to  
-P-A-G-E-120
120 SouTuHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
hear speakers on educational topics encourage us to believe that 
the task of pointing the way to our end will not be so difficult. 
The State Superintendents are the leaders in this campaign. 
Circulars must be sent from their offices to the people. Scholar- 
ly men of known oratorical ability should be invited to address 
the state legislatures and plead with our law makers for wiser 
school laws. Every educational force in each state should be 
brought to bear on this question. It seems to me more depends 
on our State Superintendents in this relation than upon any 
others. We shall look to them as the logical leaders in this 
movement. If they are without interest what can we expect of 
the teachers? If they are to manipulate their offices to further 
political ambition the people will be the sufferers. Can any one 
doubt that when the rural people are assured that the educa- 
tional forces of a state are at work for their good, when they 
realize that we go before them in the interest of bone of their 
bone and flesh of their flesh, they will fail to respond ? 
A word to those who are in a position to help our State Super- 
intendents in their campaigns. If the principals and superin- 
tendents of our town and city schools will co-operate with these 
officials they can secure the passage of every needed act of legis- 
lation. In my own state a great many teachers have offered 
their services to the county superintendents and waged 
a campaign among their people. In several instances when the 
county superintendent was indifferent these earnest teachers 
have sought invitations to address the people of their county on 
educational questions. They have reached them through the 
papers. Pardon a personal reference—a few weeks ago I 
accepted an invitation to deliver an address in a community 
where the people had just completed a commodious school build-_ 
ing. This community is remote from the railroad. By 
consolidating three small schools, and with some aid from the 
county and from private sources, these people have today 
superior educational facilities. Their building is equipped 
with the best school furniture. Their principal is a college 
graduate, and his assistants are all skilled teachers. Three 
such schools have been built and organized in that county dur- 
ing the year. They are typical rural high schools. Does any 
one believe that these people will become dissatisfied with their 
environment so long as they have an opportunity to give their 
children a chance in life? In the communities where these 
schools are found the State Superintendent, the county super-
-P-A-G-E-121
Tue Private Hien ScHoou 121 
intendent, the principals of the town schools, and many other 
citizens have aroused the people to their needs. The truth is, 
ladies and gentlemen, the progressiveness of the times, the reali- 
zation by all our people that this is an age of prepared men and 
women in every calling, is a mighty factor—no doubt the 
greatest—in our favor. These people must have strong men to 
supervise their schools. If the county superintendent is to 
accomplish his great mission; if he is to be instrumental in giv- 
ing the Southland a more progressive and intelligent citizen- 
ship; if he is to respond to the hands reaching up into his life, 
he must not only be well paid, and well trained, but he must 
have the help of every school assistant, principal and superin- 
tendent in the field. 
The plea I come before you to make above all else is to 
beseech every teacher in our Southland to do his part in press- 
ing this work among his people, and in seeking the earnest co- 
operation of all our citizens, to the end that the dignity of the 
important office of county superintendent shall be in consonance 
with its demands. My plea is to urge every earnest man and 
woman to uphold the superintendent in his work, that he may 
accomplish his great mission. With a steady adherence to our 
obligations in these matters, with a just sense of our duty to the 
society of our section, let us march forward resolved to give 
every boy and girl in our Southern States a square deal—a 
chance to develop their God-given attributes, until they shall 
all stand forth strong American citizens, able to appreciate to 
the fullest extent the duties and obligations resting upon us as 
a section and as a nation. 
THE PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL. 
W. R. Wess, Principal Webb School, Bell Buckle, Tenn. 
The private high school was the first of all schools in time. 
Its value was so great that the church felt it necessary to aid 
it and then to take control of it. It is human to exercise 
power when possible, and the church tried to monopolize the 
best possible means of generating power. She saw the power 
that intelligence would give her. The value of schools to a 
rapid dissemination of truth is self-evident. The church, 
through the schools, a power brought into existence, as all
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
powers are, by individual initiative, virtually grasped all power 
and took into its own resources the political as well as moral 
forces, and became a tyrant. 
When the church power was weakened, the state could see 
what immense forces were in the hands of political rulers and 
kings by their organizing the schools and supporting them by 
taxation, and finally republican governments under the leader- 
ship of the democrats of Switzerland felt that ignorance was. 
too easily excited by dangerous principles propagated by dan- 
gerous men, and saw the absolute necessity of founding schools 
for all the people. At first government entered the thin end 
of the wedge by founding elementary schools, but soon saw 
the necessity of founding universities and high schools. 
The large majority of the human family are, and always have 
been, and always will be, unable to provide adequate means 
from private resources to educate their children. | Whether 
the principle of taxing one man to educate and train another 
man’s child is right or wrong, is not the question involved in 
my subject. What the people want is ultimately justified in 
morals by them, and the public high school is here to stay. Can 
it meet all the demands made upon it? I answer, no. 
The ideal public high school, teaching the moral as well as 
the intellectual, can only be established in districts densely 
populated ‘by a homogeneous people, who have a common: 
race and a common religion. Race prejudice and instinct, 
and religious denominations emphasizing different moral and 
religious standards, and emphasizing different ecclesiastical 
policies, will always present complex problems of adjustment 
too difficult for human solution. 
The private high school, limited by conditions of success 
only, will always be needed to accommodate the youth of sparse- 
ly settled people and the youth of those dissatisfied with the 
standards of moral training in their public high schools. This 
alone would justify its existence. 
In the second place, the course of study in the public high 
school can not be ideal, fixed as it is by those not competent to 
fix educational requirements. There is no hope that the law- 
makers of our country, selected by universal suffrage, can ever 
be above the average in intelligence. There is no hope that 
only experts in education can ever be in any legislature on the 
Committee of Education. The course of study established by 
law must necessarily be a compromise in which the ideal must
-P-A-G-E-123
  Tue Private Hien Scnoon 123 
be lowered to the demands of those who don’t know. The 
National Teachers’ Association spent years in trying to get 
the relations between the colleges and the high schools adjusted. 
They appointed a committee of experts. That committee ap- 
pointed a sub-committee on each of the departments considered 
necessary for preparation for college. The sub-committee on 
Latin demanded as many hours as they though indispensable, 
the sub-committee on Greek likewise, and so with that on math- 
ematics, on English, on history, on modern languages, and on 
science. The Committee of Ten had, as they said, only four 
years at their command. The requirements of these sub-com- 
mittees demanded six or more years. The Committee of Ten 
found themselves overwhelmed, experts that they were. How, 
then, can the public high school be adjusted to an ideal course 
by the lawmaker of average intelligence when the greatest 
experts found themselves unable to limit the requirement with- 
in reasonable bounds? The private high school is for this 
reason a necessity where the teacher is in his own “committee 
of ten” reasonably to adjust the course of study to God-given 
limitations, to capacity, and to time. 
The public will not for a long time yet allow sufficient 
money to its schools to properly adjust the number of teachers 
to the number of students. 
The graded system indispensable in the public school makes 
no allowance for those students who show aptitude. The 
bright children from intelligent families are necessarily classed 
with the dull and ignorant, who at home have no literature nor 
intelligent association to enrich and stimulate their minds, 
The thoroughbred hitched beside a plug for life may possibly 
improve in some small degree the gait of the plug, but the 
thoroughbred will lose in his training all excellencies that come 
from breeding, and has thwarted the purposes of that breeding. 
The private school justifies its existence here. Its classifica- 
tion is based on skill in each study and not in all studies, and 
justifies its existence by not holding back the brightest and 
maturest minds to a gait established by the dullest and most 
immature minds. 
Again, progress is made only by experiment, manipulated 
by individual initiative. In this age of transition from au- 
thority to experiment, there must ‘be somewhere an experi- 
ment station for the crop of children where authority in the 
use of tools and methods is not compulsory. It is more diffi-
-P-A-G-E-124
124 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION | 
cult to influence large bodies of men than individuals. A new 
text-book of immense value, and greatly superior to the one in 
use, may be produced. It has never ‘been tried. It might 
never be tried if a whole state had to be influenced. <A private 
teacher in his experiment station, his own board on selecting 
text-books, seeing its wonderful advance over the one in use, 
can quickly test and demonstrate its usefulness in his labora- 
tory and in this way reach, after many years, the board of 
public control. The private school is the only experiment sta- 
tion for the present crop of children. This justifies its ex- 
istence. . 
The private schools by increase in numbers do not in any way 
reduce the income of public schools, but simply relieve their 
overcrowded classes, and in this way assist the public school 
teacher by rendering him more efficient in enabling him to 
concentrate his ability on fewer units. The public high school 
and ‘the private high school are in no sense rivals, in no sense 
antagonistic, and in no sense duplicates of the same advan- 
tages. They are to each other supplementary. 
No country in the world is so thoroughly supplied with 
public high schools as is New England, and there are more 
endowed private and church schools in that section than else- 
where. These private schools are patronized and sustained by 
their home people. 
Those most competent to judge ‘the ‘best for their children 
seek the private ‘high school and its advantages when the public 
high school is absolutely free of expense to them. 
It is nonsense to say, as some do, that it is a social question, 
and that only would-be aristocrats patronize the private school. 
The manufacturing and mining centers must be supplied with 
publie schools. The moral and intellectual standards in such 
centers make it necessary for native Americans to found pri- 
vate schools to preserve the purity of their blood and civiliza- 
tion. In Quincy, Mass., a suburb of Boston, in the heyday of 
Prof. Parker in public education, with a strong corps of well- 
paid teachers, Dr. Everett’s private school for boys commanded 
the patronage at a large tuition fee of the thoughtful Quincy 
people, and the Braintree private girls’ school had a carload 
of girls each day from Quincy to secure the advantages of 
that great institution. I spent weeks in looking into the rela- 
tive advantages of the public high schools and the private high 
schools in New England. There is not time to give facts.

RELATION OF THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE TO THE PusLic ScHoon 125 
My conclusion was that there were as many private schools in 
New England as there were children enough of real cultured 
people to fill them. 
No greater mistake would be made in education than to 
break up individual initiative in teaching and turn over all 
the schools to commissions and boards of education. 
Somewhere ‘there ought to be a place for a teacher, who is 
his own ‘board of trustees, to express himself with no other lim- 
itations than the conditions of suecess—somebody ‘to stem a 
eraze for the tragic in human life for the fun of the thing, 
until the god of evolution shall roll round the day when he 
shall adapt Don Quixote to modern conditions. 
THE RELATION OF THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE TO THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOL. 
S. M. Tucker, Professor of English Language and Literature, State College 
for Women, Tallahassee, Fla. 
Only a few years ago our colleges would perhaps have ridi- 
culed the idea that they could entertain any relations with the 
public schools, and their air of patronizing condescension was 
not such as to encourage familiarity or inspire confidence. But 
with the tremendous growth of our public high schools, an in- 
crease of fifty per cent. in attendance in one decade, and the 
relative decrease in attendance at private preparatory schools, 
our colleges have of necessity assumed a change of attitude in 
their recognition of the dignity and importance of high school 
work and the tremendous power wielded by these colleges of the 
people. There is now coming into existence an intelligent co- 
operation between the colleges and high schools that promises 
well for the future of education in the southern states. 
The most significant expression of this co-operation is the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools with 
its adoption of uniform entrance examinations. Beyond doubt, 
the public high schools of the southern states need a stimulus 
toward more thorough work, toward work of a higher grade, 
and toward broader courses. So, too, the colleges of the south- 
ern states need to come to a better common understanding of 
aims and methods. 
All this the uniform entrance examinations are supposed to
-P-A-G-E-126
126 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
accomplish ; and some of this they have doubtless done. But, as 
we may see from the experience of the northern and eastern 
states, there is great danger of making a fetich of these examina- 
tions and looking upon them as an end in themselves rather 
than a means. To the graduate of the city high school they 
may present no difficulties, but to the country boy who has had 
no such advantages they may form an impassable barrier to a 
college education. 
Any student who is qualified to profit more by college work 
than by work of a lower grade has a right to be in college with 
all the burden of his technical deficiencies upon him. As a dis- 
tinguished teacher has recently said, our entrance standard 
should be “What is the boy fitted to receive?” rather than 
“What does the boy know?” It is a notorious fact in educa- 
tional circles that certain of our colleges having a high standard 
of entrance require very little of their students during the col- 
lege course and grant them a degree that is rather a reward for 
four years of indolence than of industry; while other colleges 
having very flexible entrance standards require a large amount 
of thorough work as requisite for graduation. 
There is still another danger in rigid entrance requirements ; 
for, absurd as the statement may seem at first blush, such a 
thing as too perfect preparation for college is an actual possi- 
bility. College teachers are only too familiar with the pre- 
cocious youngster who, through the breadth of his preparatory 
course, has brushed the bloom off too many subjects, and by 
the very superiority of his preparation is encouraged to habits 
of indolence and indifference, thus destroying interest and 
weakening character. 
A far greater danger than this, however, is that which lies 
in narrowing high school curricula to such an extent that the 
public high school becomes a mere preparatory school; for 
these high school courses of study are too often made from the 
standpoint of the college teacher rather than from that of the 
expert in secondary education. To see how real is this danger 
we have but to glance at the experience of the northern and 
eastern states where rigid college entrance requirements, at one 
time beneficial and stimulating, have at last come to exert upon 
the public high school an influence perhaps more baleful than 
beneficial. For instance, in the high school study of Latin and 
Greek, the colleges insist that a large amount of ground shall 
be covered, so many texts read, and so on. Now we hear the
-P-A-G-E-127
    RELATION OF THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE TO THE PuBLIC ScHoou 127 
high school teacher asserting that such a course results in a 
mere “smattering” of knowledge at the expense of genuine 
power. From teaching of this kind no mental discipline ac- 
erues; and, if we can trust the assurances of college teachers, 
such “smattering” is apt to prove a bane to college work. What, 
then, is the relation of the college to the high-school in the mat- 
ter of entrance examinations? On the studies that test the stu- 
dent’s power as distinct from his knowledge, studies prerequis- 
ite to the course he wishes to take in college, such, for instance, 
as algebra and geometry, for any technical course involving 
higher mathematics—upon such studies as these the college may 
safely assume to examine its applicants for admission. Such 
prerequisite studies look ahead toward the college course and 
test the student’s capacity for higher work. But, as regards 
the subsidiary studies, those that look behind rather than ahead, 
that concern the secondary school as such rather than the sec- 
ondary school as a college preparatory school, surely the ap- 
plicant may be admitted to college by a certificate from an afiil- 
iated school. Granting that admission by certificate is dan- 
gerous, there is certainly less danger of injustice in accepting 
a certificate from a worthy school than in rigid examinations 
that cannot adequately test a student’s power. 
However, as between rigid examination requirements and 
admission by certificate only, the Southern Association has 
adopted the golden mean—a course that, while encouraging the 
high schools to do higher and more thorough work through a 
wide dissemination of entrance questions, may still admit by 
certificate the student who has proven to competent instructors 
his ability to do more advanced work even though he be defi- 
cient in some of the branches ordinarily required for college 
entrance. 
This is admirable; but in our southern college entrance re- 
quirements lies at least one grave defect; only the old conserva- 
tive course of liberal arts is recognized: history, the languages, 
the sciences, and mathematics. No credit whatsoever is given 
for manual, industrial and commercial work, for civics, econom- 
ics and art. Surely these last mentioned studies may give at 
least as adequate a preparation for college, in real power to 
think and do, as the studies of the old curriculum. And what 
else than this power have we a right to require? for what else 
is of genuine importance? It would seem that the real duty 
of our colleges toward the high schools lies not merely in in-
-P-A-G-E-128
128 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
sistence upon more thorough work and higher standards, but in 
the generous recognition of these new studies as makers of ca- 
pacity and as factors in the promotion of culture. 
For instance, the attitude of the colleges to the high schools 
as regards the study of Latin might be amusing if it were not 
a source of menace to the usefulness of our public schools. We 
of the conservative southern states are slow to surrender an 
out-worn superstition, clinging with mighty tenacity to the 
Latin fetich. Now, that Latin when really well taught, may 
impart true culture, no sensible teacher can deny; but what is 
the real condition of Latin teaching in most of our schools and 
colleges? It is a mere grammatical and syntactical grind— 
dull, deadening and horrible, without a grain of literary appre- 
ciation or any ability to impart genuine culture. So much for 
the culture value of Latin as it is usually taught. Furthermore, 
that the study of Latin is really essential in itself, is prere- 
quisite to any line of work, fulfils any function that is not as 
well or better discharged by other studies—this is an exploded 
superstition. Dr. Harris congratulates us upon the increase 
in the number of Latin students in the secondary schools from 
34 per cent. in 1890 to 50 per cent. in 1900. This is good. But 
what shall we make of the corresponding figures also given out 
by the United States Commissioner of Education, namely, that 
the number of students entering our colleges from the secondary 
schools had decreased from 14 per cent. in 1890 to 11 per cent. 
am 1900? These be the figures; let us make the most of them. 
Latin, however, is but one study and is merely a single 
feature of the fallacy so widely disseminated and unfortunate- 
ly insisted upon by our colleges, namely, that “preparation for 
college” is identical with “preparation for life.” It is a happy 
sign that this idol of the college market-place is tottering on 
its pedestal. As a matter of fact, as Dr. G. Stanley Hall says, 
fitting for college is so far from being a fitting for life that it 
is probably at least a temporary unfitting; for our entrance ex- 
aminations as they are constituted at present are too academic, 
bookish, and remote from life, to afford any actual preparation 
for its duties. We are of course compelled to admit that the 
time spent on a study of the methods used in acquiring it must, 
to a certain extent, be determined by the purpose of the stu- 
dent. It is thus reasonable to grant that the student who, from 
the beginning of his high school course, intends to prepare for 
college may pursue a somewhat different course from that stu-
-P-A-G-E-129
RELATION OF THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE TO THE PuBLIC ScHoot 129 
dent who must go out into life equipped only with high school 
training. But the great majority of students discover only 
toward the end of their high school course that they wish to 
enter college. Shall such students be debarred, provided that 
they have the training and the essential power that fit them for 
college work? If the preparation for college is a matter of 
essential power, certainly the preparation for life is also largely 
the ability to think and to act. So, while we must deny that at 
present preparation for college is essentially preparation for 
life, we are prepared to assert that preparation for life is, or 
should be, preparation for college. It is the business of our col- 
leges simply to extend the preparation for life begun in the 
high schools, and our college curricula should be so adjusted 
that any student after pursuing satisfactory high school courses 
of any character—that is, courses that have trained him in es- 
sential power of thought and action, should be admitted to cor- 
responding courses in college. 
Furthermore, as has been said, the relation of our southern 
colleges to the public schools is largely complicated by the con- 
dition, or, to speak more correctly, by the practical non-exist- 
ence of our rural high schools. As long as our students are 
largely recruited from the country schools where so-called 
preparation for college is largely limited to a little drill in lan- 
guages and mathematics, and as long as these country boys con- 
tinue to do good work in our colleges, we shall have to proceed 
very delicately in the matter of entrance examinations. It 
may be that in time, as the Southern States grow in wealth and 
population, we can evolve a system of rural high schools equal 
to that of New England; but at present, when the average 
school life in the Southern States is but two and one-half years, 
and one-third of our southern children have absolutely no edu- 
cational opportunities whatsoever, we shall have to continue to 
admit many a country lad, who comes to us with a few dollars 
in his pockets and his one suit of clothes upon his back, not sim- 
ply without rigid examinations, but possibly without even a 
satisfactory certificate. 
This mention of the unprepared but enthusiastic rural stu- 
dent leads us to refer to the institution that has recently been 
the target for so much reproach and vituperation: the college 
preparatory department. It is easy to assert that this institu- 
tion is an unmitigated curse; that as long as it exists the public 
high school will suffer; that we have no right to place the col- 
legiate and the preparatory student under the same system of
-P-A-G-E-130
130 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION _ 
government. It is true that the college preparatory depart- 
ment can not possibly do the work of the local high school; it 
is true that such a department often creates bad feeling and 
hampers the usefulness of its college; but that it is an unmiti- 
gated curse and that it has no place in our system of southern 
education in its present stage of development, we most strenu- 
ously deny. There are many boys who are absolutely debarred 
from attending any public school that would afford adequate 
preparation for college, who are deficient in one or more studies 
required for admission, and whose only hope for a college edu- 
cation lies in the college preparatory department. At least I 
know it may be so in Florida, whose high school system as it 
stands on paper has been called the best in “the South;” and 
I suspect it may be so in other Southern States. As regards 
the question of discipline, this is simply a matter of segregating 
the preparatory students so that their manners and morals may 
not be injured by the collegians! 
But while admitting that the college preparatory department 
may in some sections at present be a necessity, we deplore that 
such should be the case and gladly acknowledge that the rela- 
tion of our colleges to the public schools demands that the col- 
lege shall encourage the public high school in every way possi- 
ble, increase its dignity, widen its curriculum, supply it with 
well trained instructors, establish it in every urban, and, as far 
as possible, in every rural community, and magnify its impor- 
tance, not merely as the preparatory school, but as the college 
of the people almost 90 per cent. of whose students complete 
their education within its walls. 
If these admirable results are to be achieved, however, it is 
unfortunate that high school curricula should be in so unsettled 
a condition and that there should exist so great a misconception 
concerning the true function of secondary education. For, on 
the one hand, we have the colleges saying “Thou shalt prepare 
for college”—that is, shall sacrifice the interests of the many to 
the predelictions of the few; and, on the other hand, we have 
the people at large and all our experts in secondary education 
urging with ever insistent voices that high school curricula 
should first of all be adapted to fit the average student for life. 
And yet there appears to be no true conception of what this 
“preparation for life” may be or what the high school curricu- 
lum should include. It would seem, to paraphrase the words of 
Professor Hanus, that entirely irrespective of preparation for

intelligent self-support; should stimulate every pupil to pro- 
mote the welfare of society; should stimulate every pupil to 
carry on his own development whether in college or in the 
active work of life. If these postulates be true, we need a 
great broadening of our high school curricula; we need the 
establishment of manual, industrial, and commercial courses 
“that minister directly to social and vocational aims.” It is 
significant that the report of the United States Commissioner 
of Education, when giving statistics about the high school 
status, makes absolutely no mention of these lines of work. This 
is the characteristic point of view of the so-called “higher edu- 
cation.” Our colleges have not recognized the fact that while 
they may have been standing still, new subjects of instruction 
have grown up, have assumed dignity and power, and now de- 
mand recognition. 
If all the foregoing be true, it would seem expedient that our 
colleges encourage a modification and broadening of our high 
school curricula along three general lines that may now be 
briefly indicated. 
First, nothing is more significant and perhaps more disheart- 
ening in the southern high school system than our general dis- 
regard for manual and industrial training, which practically 
does not exist in our public high schools, but is almost entirely 
relegated to private institutions. In this respect we are far 
behind other sections of the United States, where, in most city 
schools, at least, manual, industrial, and commercial courses are 
a recognized part of the curriculum. So, while urging the ne- 
cessity for broader culture in our public schools, and the obliga- 
tion of these schools to train the young citizen and patriot, we 
must not fail to recognize the equally great necessity for a 
training specifically utilitarian. One of the most patent and 
discouraging economic facts of the day lies in the vast number 
of what we may call “drifters,” young men and boys without 
any industrial training either general or specific, who drift 
aimlessly from one occupation to another without purpose, ap- 
parently without ambition, never rising high, never achieving 
definite results. Many a time we have to plead with young 
students to have some special aim, to gain a knowledge of some 
particular pursuit and to apply themselves to its mastery. 
Our southern boys are only too largely such “drifters.” 
What is the cause? and wherein lies the remedy? What 
is the cause but defective schooling? and wherein lies the
-P-A-G-E-132
132 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
remedy but in the public schools? While we perhaps would 
not urge that each boy master some particular trade, yet surely 
we may insist upon a certain manual and industrial training, a 
certain knowledge of principles, that shall enable the boy who 
must work for a living to work intelligently and with good re- 
sults. However, work of this kind must not be divorced from 
broad culture. If our public schools refuse this opportunity 
and reject their obvious responsibility, the private schools of 
manual, industrial, and commercial training will take up the 
work with the inevitable and fatal result of that divorce be- 
tween utility and culture which the college should strive above 
all things to prevent, and which means the degradation of edu- 
cational ideals. 
But, in addition to the need of such training as this, we can 
see in our high school curriculum another grave defect and an- 
other importunate need. This defect lies in the pathetically 
small attention paid by our public schools to civics, economics, 
and the right kind of history. The business of the public high 
school is not merely to teach the student to make a living, but 
to train him to be a citizen and patriot. Now, surely the neces- 
sity for civic and economic training in our public schools is 
glaringly apparent. Today we stand aghast at the revelation of 
public corruption with instances of which and their concom- 
mitant train of sordid details our periodicals overflow. It is 
only too evident that the vast proportion of our citizenship 
“knows nothing and cares less” about civie opportunities and 
responsibilities. Men are either blind or corrupt; instances of 
dishonest dealing are not far to seek; legislative bodies are be 
coming a hissing and a reproach. And so it is not only in 
politics, but in the world of finance. The “high finance” seems 
to have degenerated into the high art of practicing colossal 
fraud, and those who sit on thrones in the world of business gre 
losing the true divinity that should hedge the king. Corruption 
in politics and dishonesty in business! Wherein lies the remedy 
for political corruption but in the training of the young citizen 
in our public schools ? Wherein lies the remedy for business dis- 
honesty save in the character building that should accompany 
every phase of educational work? By giving the young citizen, 
who would be a king of high finance and a leader of his fellows, 
the tools of his trade and the ability to use them effectively, but, 
at the same time and always, reminding him of the importance 
of using these instruments not merely for self-aggrandizement,
-P-A-G-E-133
  RELATION OF THE SOUTHERN COLLEGE TO THE PuBLIC ScHoon 133 
but also for the public weal. Such training is at least as much 
needed in the southern states as in any part of our country. It 
is the business of our colleges to encourage these patriotic 
studies in the public schools and to extend and broaden them in 
the college.t 
Finally, the relations of our colleges to our public schools de- 
mand that we should encourage something even beyond utili- 
tarian training and the education of the young citizen, but 
which supplements and ministers to both in a fashion most 
beautiful and complete. This last and great duty is our obliga- 
tion to encourage in the public schools a greater breadth of gen- 
eral culture. And by “culture” we mean a knowledge of the 
best things that have been said and done in the world, a certain 
refinement and grace of conduct, a delicacy of moral sensibility, 
a breadth of human sympathy, and an ardent love for all that 
is beautiful and good. When due recognition has been paid to 
other lines of work, surely we can still find room in our high 
school courses for the amenities of life. If our high school 
students go out from us quite blind to the beauties of the world 
of nature and the glories of the world of art they have perhaps 
forever lost the purest pleasure of life and sold their birth-right 
for a mess of pottage. Life is more than meat and the body 
than raiment; and “preparation for life” includes not merely 
the wherewithal of mere subsistence, the grossly utilitarian, but 
also a recognition of all that gives life meaning and beauty. To 
know something about painting, music, sculpture and poetry, is 
not the privilege of the few, but the birth-right of the many. 
Nor does this general knowledge to appreciate sufficiently the 
more obvious beauties of art imply any technical skill. While 
it may be impracticable to teach thoroughly the fine arts in our 
public schools, it is certainly possible in this day of populariza- 
tion in matters artistic somewhat to open the eyes of our stu- 
dents to the beauty and meaning of art in its broader and more 
obvious aspects. 
We hear from our students quite too much about money- 
making; they are taking too utilitarian a view of education. 
Several times within the past two years I have been astonished 
to hear from a number of students, among them some of the 
10n this subject I have been greatly pleased and benefited by the 
excellent address made last year before the Southern Association of Colleges 
by Prof. W. H. Heck of the University of Virginia in which he emphasizes 
the duty of the public schools in training the young citizen and shows the 
need of more practical methods for achieving this result. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
best, expression of a most distorted educational ideal. They 
virtually say, “I am here to learn to make money.” Now, this 
view of education has lately been too much insisted upon. That 
our students are gaining what they call “an education” in order 
not merely to support existence, but to become intelligent citi- 
zens, and enjoy the beauties of nature and art, to contribute 
something to the well-being of humanity, to get the best out of 
life—this high conception seems to labor under a still partial 
but ever-growing eclipse. While we are emphasizing the utili- 
ties of education and urging the necessity for industrial train- 
ing, let us yet remember that utilitarianism divorced from the 
culture above indicated is of all things most sordid and base. 
The boy is not being educated simply to become a rich man, a 
captain of industry, a cattle king, a coal baron, a turpentine 
prince, a cotton lord, or a tobacco duke. To be sure he must 
gain a livelihood; he must not be a drone in the hive of life; he 
must be a worker and, if possible, a leader; but, far above this, 
he must be a citizen, an incorruptible patriot, a lover of his 
kind, an appreciator of the arts that give life its grandeur and 
beauty. 
We may say that the colleges are the safe-guard of such cul- 
ture; but what shall we do for the great mass who never reach 
our colleges? Shall the college arrogate to itself all ethics and 
esthetics? If our colleges are the conservators of culture, as 
we claim, then it is their business to encourage in our southern 
secondary schools higher and finer ideals of education; to fur- 
nish these with college men of broad culture and high educa- 
tional ideals as teachers. But this happy condition can never 
be realized until our college teachers shall cease to look upon 
the secondary teacher as a subordinate and shall cease to regard 
a knowledge of pedagogies as something beneath the sovereign 
notice of the college specialist. As a matter of fact, what stu- 
dent of education does not admit that if the question be one of 
relative values the college teacher must yield in the dignity 
and importance of his work to the teacher in the public school? 
Such, briefly and imperfectly indicated, are the lines along 
which the inter-relations of our colleges and public schools may 
be rendered more cordial and mutually beneficial. 
When the dawn comes and educational fads and fallacies are 
with the dead past; when worn out superstitions shall have 
been abandoned; when our high school curricula shall be as 
broad as the actual preparation for life requires; when our col-
-P-A-G-E-135
  Discussion 185 
leges shall graciously recognize in their admission requirements 
all high school work that has gone to the making of essential 
character and power; when the high school system of the 
southern states shall have been so perfected that the college pre- 
paratory department and the fitting school may be discontinued 
—then, indeed, the relations subsisting between our southern 
colleges and the public schools will attain the ideal, and both 
college and high school can intelligently cooperate without loss 
of energy.or misdirected effort to produce the trained worker, 
the man of culture, and the intelligent citizen. 
DISCUSSION. 
Prof. W. R. Webb, Tennessee: I would like to say a few 
words, if the Association will permit me. I had a letter from 
a gentleman from—well, I will not locate him, but I want the 
sympathy of this audience. He wrote me he was going to send 
me his son, and he said he wanted me to make of him a 
“Gy-h-o-l-e-s-a-i-l” merchant. (Laughter.) Now, I had never 
been in a wholesale store or business, never had dealt with a 
“wholesail” merchant, and yet he wanted me to make his son a 
wholesale merchant. My friends, this is an important subject, 
dealing with the young men of the country. 
Now, I want to say the object and purpose of schools for 
all times has been to teach the children to read. The twenty- 
six little letters of the alphabet are the greatest invention that 
man has ever made. I't lengthens memory and experience, 
whereas all other inventions of man simply multiply physical 
force, and the limitations upon a teacher are to teach the chil- 
dren to read, and that is all he can do. And when we have 
taught them to read in the primary school, they certainly ought 
not to have a diploma, but they ought to be taught to read 
in broader and deeper lines in the high school; then in the 
college, then in the university and post-graduate school, and 
in all the professional schools. All tthe great judges con do 
is to teach their young law students to read with appreciation 
the principles of law, and the only thing that the men in the 
medical schools can do is to teach their students to read with 
appreciation the principles that underly medicine, and when 
we undertake to eliminate Latin, for instance, I just come 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 SouruERN EpucatTionaL ASSOCIATION 
down to one subject, because he took that, then there is no such 
thing as high culture in English literature, without a knowl- 
edge of the classics. (Applause. ) 
There isn’t a single man that can read Shakespeare with 
appreciation that does not know Latin. He not only can not 
read Shakespeare, but he can not read Milton. He can not 
read any of the standard authors in our literature, and you 
turn on the civilization of the world the youth trained up in 
manual training, and you turn him loose on the earth inca- 
pable of appreciating this splendid literature which our Anglo- 
Saxon forefathers handed down to us. 
There are some teachers that teach Latin very inefiiciently, 
but, my dear sir, did you ever see a man in science that was 
somewhat of a bore? That simply turns on a question. I 
have seen the man of science that didn’t have anything to 
bore with. (Laughter.) 
I want to protest here and now for the sake of the South. 
I offered my life for it, I shed my blood for it, I will shed 
my popularity today, if need be, in protesting against putting 
into a course of study so many things that you absolutely sap 
the juices out of youth in fitting them either for life or for 
college. (Applause. ) 
The course of study is now beyond the possibility of any 
ordinary youth. The demands upon teachers, and young teach- 
ers, who undertake to carry out the program of the Committee 
of Ten—and pardon me if my egotism comes to the front, but 
I was one of the sub-committee on Latin and attended that last 
final convention of the Committee of Ten and saw the embar- 
rassment when they were requiring of us teachers to do in 
four years what required six years or more to accomplish. It 
just can not be done, my young teachers, and the course of 
study that is marked out for the high school, in the law of 
Tennessee, can not be done in the time required by any living 
man with any ordinary class of children. We have got too 
much required of us now. My time, I see, is out. That was 
an able paper that was presented; it is a work of genius, but 
a young man who undertakes to take an ordinary child and 
stuff all that into him—he can’t do it. I have heard that 
you could stuff fowls and make them very fat, but it is fat 
only and there is no brain in it. (Laughter and applause.) 
Mr. J. H. Fuqua, Kentucky: I see that Judge Beckner of 
Winchester, Kentucky, is with us. He is one of our educa-

tional wheel-horses in Kentucky, and I know you would like to 
hear from him. 
Judge William Beckner, Kentucky: Mr. President, La- 
dies and Gentlemen—I am very grateful for the privilege of 
saying a word to you, and in this worshipful presence cer- 
tainly I will not discuss the questions that have been pre- 
sented nor say a word about the value of education, except 
such thoughts as I have gathered from the slight attention I 
have given and that you all must have gathered with your in- 
telligence; and one is that the general things we lack in the 
South for an efficient system of education are money and teach- 
ers. Money will get teachers, but teachers don’t get money, 
you know. (Laughter.) 
I for many years have taught in my state and been an 
humble lay preacher of schools good enough for all, good enough 
for the best. That is the standard in the North, that their 
schools shall be good enough for the best, and we should provide 
them in every district. We have undertaken to have compul- 
sory education. Paul says: “How shall they hear, unless they 
have a preacher, and how can he preach unless he be sent?” 
How can they learn unless they have teachers, and how can 
they teach unless they are trained? 
First, we must have normal schools, and in Kentucky we 
are waging an active campaign. In Massachusetts they spend 
$300,000, in New York $590,000, Ohio $200,000 and in the 
new state of Wisconsin $200,000, in Kentucky $4,000, in Ten- 
nessee $40,000 I believe. But we need normal schools scat- 
tered throughout the state, and we need money to pay our 
teachers. For years I have given every thought of my life 
and every moment of my time that I could spare to this cause 
of education, and I have had a scheme that would have bene- 
fitted this cause. That is, to have the federal government 
equalize the states in the matter of land grants. The old 
states that gained all this territory have not gotten their share. 
The new states, beginning with California and running down 
to this time, have had two sections out of every township given 
to them for this cause, but the old states that fought for our 
liberties have not gotten it, the old states that helped to get 
this new territory have had no money for their schools, and I 
was anxious to see it equalized, and introduced the bill to 
equalize the matter of land grants. But I was only there a 
short term; I did not return—I could not return—for I was
-P-A-G-E-138
138 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of that class of people that thought a hundred cents on the 
dollar was none too good for Americans, but the good people 
among whom I was and whom I love and are good, honest 
people, were in favor of paying fifty cents on a dollar. But 
I have been in favor of education too long, and therefore didn’t 
favor that. (Applause. ) 
I do believe in schools good enough for the best, and I do 
think that these old states should have justice done to them 
before all this large domain is given away. And if we had 
on this basis of territory, the area of the state, appropriated 
by the federal government, which has the power over the 
public domain, we have yet 450,000,000 acres of land, and it 
would only take 35,000,000 acres to equalize the states. I 
have been anxious to see all these states that are interested 
rise up and fight for their rights. Three-fourths of the mem- 
bers of the lower house are interested, because their states 
have not had justice done, and I have been anxious to see 
some of the great men of the South rise up, or certainly some 
of the Northern states should. I have been anxious to see 
them take up this question and see them pass a bill that would 
give equality in the land grants. I thank you very much for 
your attention. 
THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN 
EDUCATION. 
PRESIDENT HeNry N. SNypdeER, Wofford College, Spartanburg, S. C. 
The motive behind the foundation of the earlier denomina- 
tional colleges in the South, as in other parts of the United 
States, was the demand for an educated ministry. However, 
colleges founded to train ministers not only in the special doc- 
trines of their respective churches, but also in general culture 
as well, in the course of time naturally drew upon 4 wider pat- 
ronage by inviting all the youth of the church. For the same 
argument for training the ministry within the fold of the 
church for the church could be easily pressed to include the 
youth of the church. Still, while thus widening the circle of 
their influence, the primary purpose of these first colleges was 
the training of the ministry. 
Next there came two forces which had an indirect yet strong
-P-A-G-E-139
  Tue DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN EDUCATION 139 
influence in the establishment of new colleges; these were the 
growth of a national and state sentiment and an equally vigor- 
ous ‘and assertive growth toward religious freedom, and these 
two went far toward preparing the way for state universities 
and colleges and even suggested a great central national uni- 
versity, which, alas! yet waits realization. Moreover, as the 
public school idea laid hold upon the thought of the people it 
seemed wholly logical to crown the newly-formed system with 
a college or university to complete the service of the state to 
its citizenship. Now this large activity on the part of the 
state, instead of satisfying the demands for higher education 
and decreasing the number of institutions of private founda- 
tion, served rather to stimulate the denominations to a new.zeal 
in the multiplying of colleges. This zeal had now behind it, 
not the more limited motive of the education of the ministry, 
‘but the broader one of the education of all the youth of the 
church under strict denominational influence. The inaugura- 
ion of the University of Virginia, for example, with its abso- 
lute religious freedom, looked to the churches more like a 
complete lack of religion. The fear seized them that religion 
was to be left entirely out of education, and that the youth of 
he land were to be given over to godlessness. This fear was 
further made real by the presence of men in certain faculties, 
if not hostile to Christianity, at least antagonistic to every form 
of denominationalism. As a matter of protection, therefore, 
the churches felt it their duty themselves to provide instruc- 
ion for their youth. Faith was once more at stake, they 
thought, and the youth of the church must be saved from in- 
fidelity and the vices which were supposed to follow as a 
matter of course. This represents the second stage in the 
causes leading to the multiplying of denominational colleges in 
he South. 
It should be noted that this attitude of the denominations 
joward state colleges and universities had the use of partly 
purging the latter of anti-Christian influences. While they 
might not teach definite religious doctrines, their presidents 
and faculties, though representing every and any form of re- 
ligious belief, must be at least Christian in a general way and 
in a special way must care for the moral training of those com- 
mitted to them. But aside from this influence, the desire and 
purpose of the church to safeguard its youth in matters of faith, 
because they believed that faith was really threatened, is no  
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
doubt the dominant impulse in the establishing of colleges 
from, say, 1825 to 1860, and it gave to us our oldest and per- 
haps our most reputable denominational institutions. 
After this time another view served to call other institutions 
into existence, and to strengthen the faith of the church in 
those already established. This view was based upon the con- 
ception that, after all, character was the chief thing in life, 
and therefore should be the dominant aim of education; that, 
further, the finest type of character was the product of definite 
Christian teaching; that the heart of the whole matter in edu- 
cation was a frank, unhesitating acceptance of Christ, His 
truth, and His spirit; that, in the nature of things, the individ- 
ual church was the only kind of institution that could hope to 
realize this ideal in practice. It was held and urged that col- 
leges of the state and those of private foundation asking a pat- 
ronage regardless of denominational affiliation could not, from 
the very fact that they had in their faculties and student bodies 
men representing every form of religious belief and perhaps of 
unbelief, meet the requirements necessary to train and fortify 
youth in the highest and most enduring type of character. If 
this was to be the best and final product of education, the de- 
nominations must make it possible through their schools. 
Other kinds of institutions could not do it. Of course in the 
light of the new times into which we have come, when all the 
forces of education are striving to put an ideal of character- 
building at the heart of their work, these statements with ref- 
erence to the attitude of the churches sound a bit like a far- 
fetched page of ancient history and a call to memory of the 
clamorous contentions from an old educational battleground. 
It is not to say that the churches were right in affirming that 
the colleges of the state were powerless to furnish such training 
as would thoroughly moralize their instruction and set before 
students the supreme Christian ideal of character. It is to 
say, however, that this is the way the churches looked at the 
matter, and furnished therefore yet another strong motive for 
the maintenance of denominational colleges and the founding 
of new ones.   It is clear, moreover, that the question has shifted somewhat. 
It is leading away from the original purpose of an educated 
ministry and specific instruction in the dogmas of individual 
ereeds into the larger matter of what is the best method of 
getting the Christian spirit and Christian ideals of character
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN HpucATION 141 
into education. We may all differ as to whether the church 
has found the best method of accomplishing this end, or as to 
really what is the best method. But all probably agree that at 
least the purpose of the church was in the right direction, and 
now, since we have a perspective almost removed from the 
heat and din and confusion of some rather unseemly educa- 
tional conflicts and have arrived at a position where we are 
unanimous in the thought that the function of the college is not 
only to train for practical efficiency, but also to develop and 
fortify the religious nature and shape the characters of 
men according to Christian ideals, we can grant to the 
church its inestimable benefit in holding us more or less steadily 
to this position when we might have gone far astray in our 
zeal to be un-religious in the quality of our instruction. 
Against this un-religion in education the church has protested 
loudly and unceasingly, and its institutions have been the con- 
crete witnesses in the affirmation of its educational faith. And 
their contribution in this respect has been a great and impor- 
tant contribution to our entire system of education in the South, 
particularly to higher education. Through it we dare not now 
leave religious considerations out of any phase of our educa- 
tional scheme. Moreover, I do not feel that I am overstating 
the case when I say that we not only owe this, i in part, to the 
denominational college, but also that we are in a better condi- 
tion to meet that latest demand of the best educational thought, 
which takes as the fundamental article of its creed that we may 
count all else as loss if character be not the final product of all 
our schemes, all our systems, all our methods of education. 
As is well known, these dominant causes were strong enough 
so to dot the South with colleges that one might in truth say 
that this is a college-ridden section. ‘They are of every con- 
ceivable sort as to property, equipment, resources, and faculties. 
To get something like an adequate idea of them we shall have 
to depend upon the report of the United States Commissioner 
of Education for 1903. Yet we should say that some qualifica- 
tions are necessary in using data from this source. It is two 
years old to start with, and much substantial progress has been 
made in this time; some reports go back as far as 1901; and 
some institutions are not reported at all. Moreover, as one 
examines this report, as invaluable as it is, one finds enough 
inaccuracies to raise a feeling of distrust as to its facts and 
figures. However, with due allowance, one can get from it a  
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 SourHERN EpUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
fairly adequate notion of the situation of denominational insti- 
tutions in relation to certain aspects of education in the South. 
It should be said also that no effort will be made properly to 
classify these institutions. While many of them, no doubt, 
deserve no higher rating than that of secondary schools, yet 
they will be accepted at their own valuation in this discussion. 
In the thirteen Southern States there are as many as 90 de- 
nomination&l colleges for men, most of them, however, having 
the coeducational feature. This gives an average of seven to 
each state. Tennessee and Missouri notably leading with 15 
each. In the aggregate, these 90 institutions have in their col- 
legiate departments 943 professors and 7,549 men students and 
2,177 women; they also have in their preparatory departments 
5,270 boys and 3,633 girls, with a teaching force of 411; they 
report 198 graduate students and 3,428 in professional depart- 
ments. The grand total is 1,354 instructors and 24,255 stu- 
dents, men, women, boys and girls. Taking for the sake of 
comparison the state colleges in these states, we find, exclusive 
of mechanical and agricultural institutions, 680 instructors in 
the colleges, and the number of students foots up 3,588 men 
and 768 women; in preparatory departments 600 men and 
148 women, with a teaching force of 32; graduate students, 
167, and professional students, 2,173. These figures give to- 
- tals of 721 instructors and 7,347 students. This is to say, that 
there are three and one-third as many students in the 90 de- 
nominational colleges as there are students in the 18 state col- 
leges, or nearly 80 per cent. of the entire number. These 
figures give, if nothing else, the extent of the influence of the 
denominational colleges. Whatever the nature of the training 
they furnish, it touches for better or worse the most people in 
this southern country. 
It is when we turn to material equipment and resources that 
we realize most the limitations of the denominational college. 
For example, in the general matter of property, the 90 colleges 
give an aggregate of values to the amount of $13,165,311; the 
thirteen state colleges, $5,951,349; the latter have libraries 
footing up 437,000 volumes, the former 918,436; in scientific 
apparatus and equipment the colleges supported by the state 
furnish a valuation of $860,649; those of the church only 
$945,095. That is to say, the valuation of the physical equip- 
ment of the 90 church institutions is hardly more than twice 
that of the thirteen state institutions. This deficiency becomes
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN EDUCATION 143 
all the more glaring if we take out the three or four denomina- 
tional colleges whose equipment really equals or surpasses that 
of the largest and best state colleges. 
As to endowment, we reckon the total for the denomination- 
al colleges to be $9,591,528, and that of the state colleges to be 
$4,808,730. Here, again, however, two things are to be con- 
sidered: First, a few denominational institutions have com- 
paratively large endowments, thus greatly reducing the propor- 
tion among the rest; and, secondly, the large annual appro- 
priations by the state for current expenses make similar as- 
sessments by some of the churches seem hardly worth counting. 
Now the income from endowment and appropriations to the 
state colleges reaches a total of $980,662; that to the denomi- 
national colleges, $797,488. However, there is a striking and 
notable difference in the incomes from tuition fees, small col- 
leges receiving more annually from this source than their cor- 
responding state colleges with considerably more students. The 
denominational colleges receive from this source $740,288; the 
state colleges only a total of $174,842. It is clear from this 
that, while the churches have been far from either adequately 
equipping or endowing their institutions, they have made par- 
tial compensation through a tuition-fee paying patronage. 
And this is a considerable gain. 
Now to sum up the physical aspect of the denominational 
colleges in the mass, we may say that, including property, li- 
braries, scientific apparatus, and endowment, these colleges 
represent invested capital to the amount of $23,601,931, and 
their total income from all sources is $1,437,726. These sums 
are immense in the aggregate, though they shrink into pittances 
when divided among 90 institutions. They measure, however, 
the faith, zeal and activities of the church in what it regards as 
a special and necessary kind of education. We have a right 
to ask whether so much capital has been wisely invested, wheth- 
er, in a word, denominational education as we understand it 
is worth all that has been put into it. The answer to these 
questions leads naturally to some considerations with reference 
to the influence of denominational education. 
In the first place, these colleges have been what we call small 
colleges. In a true sense, moreover, they have been colleges 
of the people. Planted in country places, or small towns or 
villages, their patronage has been mainly local, or drawn from 
a comparatively narrow circle, rarely going beyond state lines.

They have thus brought education to the people who might not 
have gone out to seek it. In this even a superficial observer 
will see that they have served as tremendous social, intellectual 
and moral uplifting forces in special sections, doing a work, 
I am persuaded, no other kind of institution could have done. 
This phase of their influence is well described by that acute 
and sane observer, Mr. James Bryce, in his American Com- 
monwealth (vol. 2, p 568): “They sct learning in a visible 
form, plain, indeed, and humble, but dignified even in her hu- 
mility, before the eyes of a rustic people, in whom love of 
knowledge, naturally strong, might never break from the bud 
into the flower but for the care of some zealous gardener. 
They give the chance of rising in some intellectual walk of life 
to many a strong and earnest nature who might otherwise have 
remained an artisan or store-keeper, and perhaps failed in these 
avocations. They light up in many a country town what is at 
first only a farthing rushlight, but which, when the town swells 
to a city, or when endowments flow in, or when some able 
teacher is placed in charge, becomes a lamp of growing flame, 
which may finally throw its rays over the whole state in which 
it stands.” 
This has been and will still continue to be a part of the gen- 
eral mission and influence of the denominational colleges. 
With scant resources in most instances, meagre equipment and 
a limited faculty in point of numbers, they have trained men 
through the discipline of a few fundamental studies into intel- 
lectual mastery and through the dominating influence of the 
church they have kept before their students high ideals of 
Christian character. They have insisted that if both intel- 
lectual power and moral power are to be fully effective, the 
one must be thoroughly moralized and the other thoroughly in- 
tellectualized. And who shall say, whatever method we may 
pursue, that this conception is not worth preserving and 
strengthening in our educational thinking and practice? Any- 
way, without losing sight of moral training through Christian 
teaching, the denominational colleges have also served largely 
to intellectualize the life of their constituency, and their con- 
stituency has been the majority of people in the South. 
Further, the denominational college has been and is an ef- 
fective element in popular education through the agencies it is 
able to use in reaching the people. Every one knows how 
largely the mere matter of propaganda enters into the whole
-P-A-G-E-145
THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN EDUCATION 145 
question of education at the South. It frequently resolves 
itself into the simple proposition of how we shall reach the 
masses, convince them, win them, and move them to action. 
You can not always get at them through the newspapers, or 
indeed through legislative enactments. The appalling amount 
of illiteracy in the South is not as shocking in statistical re- 
ports as it is when we are meeting it actwally alive in men and 
women. Here, in the wholly illiterate who see but dimly, you 
have a great inert, if not positively hdstile, power which has 10 
be overcome before they will pay taxes, build school houses, or 
indeed send their children to school. Clearly in dealing with 
such as these we shall be put to our best resources to get the 
educational idea to work as a sort of leaven. We shall not be 
able to do it by dint of logical reasoning on the advantages of 
education or by an eloquent description of that fine vision 
which now and again comes to us all in our optimistic mo- 
ments—a vision of an intelligent, trained democracy doing the 
world’s work in the noble glow of altruistic motives. Quite 
other methods must be used. Indeed, not one, but many, 
methods will be found necessary, and even then the leavening 
process will lag painfully, and it will require all the optimism 
and faith we have to trust to the slow results of time. “There 
is an imperative necessity, therefore, for educational mis- 
sionary work and for employing without stint every agency 
that can possibly be used to get at the mass of people. 
Now I ask, What has the denominational college to do with 
this all-important propaganda-missionary phase of the South- 
ern educational problem? I answer much. In the first place, 
it is at the head of a church system that uses all its machinery 
for active, persistent educational propaganda—a propaganda 
that, while appealing to religious motives, is becoming less and 
less colored with what thas been called sectarianism, that has 
nothing to do with church doctrine as this is generally under- 
stood, and all to do with the larger question of human better- 
ment through education—education for all the people. The de- 
nominational college, then, has at its command, at least in the 
three largest churches in the Southern States—Methodist, Bap- 
tist and Presbyterian—organized ‘boards, into whose hands is 
given the important duty of systematic educational campaign-— 
ing, if the phrase may now he allowed. The chief aim is to 
bring education before the people and to put it deeply upon 
their conscience. The Southern Methodist Church furnishes  
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 SourHeRN EpvucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
a notable example of what has been done in this respect. Only 
a few years ago it was engaged in an officially authorized move- 
ment toward general ‘and higher education, conducted with 
great earnestness and enlisting the very best talent ‘at the com- 
mand of the church. All of its resources for reaching the 
people were brought into use, and there is probably not a cor- 
ner of the South, by mountain and by swamp, where the moral, 
indeed, the religious duty of education, was not preached and 
enforced. A sort of popular educational “revival” was at- 
tempted in order to mark the incoming of the new century and 
to show, from the standpoint of the church, the thing most 
needed. The definite measurable results were the raising of 
more than a million and a half dollars for educational pur- 
poses and a large increase in the number of students attending 
schools controlled by the church. But we have absolutely no 
way of measuring adequately the far more important results 
which must come from the bringing of the fundamental matter 
of education before all classes of people with the force and au- 
thority of the Christian church. Everywhere in the South 
there are more children in the schools, there are better school 
houses and better teachers and teaching, and, what is greatly 
worth while in the present stage of the problem— education! 
education! education! is still ringing in the ears of the people 
as never before. 
But it is not only through educational ‘boards that the church 
is able to get the matter before the people. The individual 
preacher is himself a sort of educational missionary. Take 
the Southern Methodist Church once more for the purpose of 
illustration: Four times a year every preacher must answer to 
his superior officer ‘this significant question, What is doing in 
the bounds of your work for the cause of education? It re- 
minds him with regular persistency of his duty, as a moral 
leader in his community, to look after the interests of the com- 
mon schools and to urge attendance. Thus with a proper 
knowledge of needs and conditions he can be a potent force in 
the educational problem. If he carries out faithfully the 
spirit and aim of his church, he is such a force. 
Now back of these agencies—organized special movements, 
regular boards for educational propaganda, and the individual 
work of the preacher as a missionary in the high cause of bring- 
ing a kind of intellectual gospel to the people through the school 
house—is the denominational college as the real brain and di-
-P-A-G-E-147
THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN EDUCATION 147 
recting force. What the college is, what are its educational 
ideals, what is its efficiency, what is its conception of its mis- 
sion as a college of ‘and for the people, how far it regards itself 
as the source from which all the efforts of the church to make 
education a real factor in the life of its membership shall re- 
ceive their constant inspiration and wisest direction—all meas- 
ure the vital and intimate relation of the denominational col- 
lege to this problem of popular education. Indeed, when one 
takes into view all the elements involved, there is certainly no 
other single agency more vitally and intimately related. 
But the denominational college has been and is itself di- 
rectly active in trying to arouse interest not only with refer- 
ence to itself, but also with reference to the general question of 
education. This it regards as a part of its mission. If the 
people do not value education, if they will not seek it, the col- 
lege, as an essential part of a great church whose aim is the 
uplifting of men, endeavors of necessity to do its share by 
going out after them and taking to them what they really need 
regardless of their indifference or indeed of their hostility. It 
makes education a matter of religion, holding unfalteringly to 
the belief that Christ came to put men on their feet, and one 
step in this is to make them more intelligent and wiser, and 
to train them to do in the best possible way a full amount 
of the world’s work—not one man, not a group or sect of 
men, but all men. This is the high motive under which 
the better type of the denominational colleges has striven and 
is striving unceasingly to create among the masses what is 
called an educational conscience. Many of them on this ac- 
count keep an agent actively in the field—a man whose duty is 
suggestively defined when we call him a sort of evangelist of 
education—a greatly needed evangelist, any one must say who 
knows eye to eye and heart to heart the people with whom one 
must deal in the South, and the general nature of the problem. 
It is a total misunderstanding of the college agent to think of 
him merely as a “drummer” for boys. He is very much more 
than this. He is usually a man of popular address, and his 
influence in drawing ambitious and capable ‘boys to college and 
in awakening public sentiment in the matter of education 
simply can not be overestimated. His very position gives him 
free access to homes, to platforms, and to pulpits, and thus, in 
very truth, he is a missionary—a home missionary—in one of 
the highest of human causes. Through him, boys fresh from
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the heart of the people, are induced to take up higher educa- 
tion; through him education generally, the building up of lo- 
cal schools, the sending of children to them regardless of the 
weather or the demands of the crops, are all made matters of 
conscience, of religious duty as well as of individual and public 
expediency. If I had space, I could add here to the fine ro- 
mance of education that gathers about almost every American 
college, a number of stirring incidents not only of boys fired to 
an heroic struggle for educational betterment and finally win- 
ning a large manhood and a full measure of worldly success, 
but also of whole communities so awakened in conscience and 
effort that such superior school facilities were established as, 
in a few years, to transform the entire community life into 
something higher than it was—all through the single visit of 
a representative of a denominational college who knew at first 
hand the temper and point of view of the people he was trying 
to ‘help and was therefore able to get at them and move them 
as no other could. All of this shows once more how vitally the 
denominational college is connected with that very important 
problem of reaching men on the question of education. ‘ 
Now let us turn to another side of the subject. In having 
all these agencies for reaching the masses, the denominational 
college draws from its constituency a large body of choice 
young men. and women. These are brought into contact with 
higher education; not, to be sure, of the sort to be had at 
Yale or at Harvard; yet of a sort with sufficient virtue in it 
to train the brains and give wise direction to energies that are 
today re-making the South in every department of activity. 
The colleges get the raw material of a pure, unwasted Ameri- 
can stock; they develop the latent power in this material, give 
to it definite purposes, train it to work efficiently, awaken it 
to broader ideals, and send the men who make up this ma- 
terial back to their respective communities as examples and 
leaders—leaders in sections, where, from the very nature of 
the case, the chief want is a want of the right kind of leadership, 
not only leadership in all that makes generally for the higher 
life of the community but also, in particular, a leadership for 
better educational facilities. But not all of. these young men 
go back to their native sections. There are those who continue 
their education at the universities and are called to larger 
duties and wider spheres of activity. 
These considerations, then, seem to make the denominational
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN SOUTHERN EDUCATION 149 
college an unusually important element in the Southern edu- 
cational problem—particularly at its present stage; the pre- 
ponderating number of students in these colleges shows how 
close they are to the people and consequently to popular edu- 
cation; they are the heads, in their respective churches, of sys- 
tematic educational propaganda; they have all the machinery 
of the church at their command for reaching the people and 
for using the religious motive as an appeal in favor of educa- 
tion; they even keep special agents in the field doing a sort of 
missionary work in putting the “educational idea” into the 
thought and upon the conscience of the masses; they draw 
choice young men and women from ‘their constituency and 
either send them back to become trained leaders there or pre- 
pare them for wider fields of activity. 
Now what of the future? Without assuming any of the 
qualities of a prophet, it seems to me that the stream of ten- 
deney points to the strengthening of those colleges whose his- 
tory and present condition give promise of assured perma- 
nency. Few, if any, new ones will be established. The law 
of the survival of the fittest, assisted by a broader and saner 
and more expert educational thought on the part of the 
churches will cut off the weak, strengthen the strong, and pre- 
vent any needless and wasteful multiplying of others. The 
splendid support and equipment which the states will give and 
ought to give to their institutions will serve as a fruitful stim- 
ulus to the churches to be more active than ever in the matter 
of endowments and physical resources and needs. The rela- 
tions between the three kinds of institutions, church, private and 
state, will grow more and more harmonious, each occupying 
its own field, supplementing, assisting, and even correcting, 
where needed, ‘the work of the other. Each will join cordially 
in the noble words of President McLean of the State University 
of Iowa: “To draw civilization out of the depths of ignorance 
we need the three-fold cord of private, church and state educa- 
tion. In the never-ending contest of liberty with tyranny we 
must have the same three-fold cable to make a cordon against 
the dominance of tyranny. When the private institution is 
constrained to hamper freedom under the pressure of a private 
patron, or the church institution to sacrifice freedom to eccle- 
siastical policies or dogmas, then we must turn to the state for 
freedom. When the politicians would constrain freedom in 
the state institution, we must depend upon the one or the other
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 SovurHERN EpvucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of the first two institutions to save the day. The community 
of interests among these institutions, each ‘having a special 
cause for existence, is greater than their diversity of interests. 
It is as shameful for the institutions of culture not to have 
cordial relations and propagate ‘sweetness and light? as it is for 
the so-called Christian denominations to quarrel. There is 
enough work for all.”

A PLEA FOR SOME OLD IDEALS. 
Presment Henry Louis Smirx, Deyidegen College, Davidson, N. C. 
No life-history runs with even flow from age to age. In 
the geologic history of our globe long periods of stability 
alternated with shorter ones of intense and revolutionary ac- 
tivity. From their long inaction the forces of change seemed 
to gather irresistible strength, and when their hour came, the 
established order of things was shaken to pieces like a house 
of cards, the physical aspect of the earth was transformed, 
and whole races of plants and animals gave place to a new 
fauna and flora. 
The same law of growth is seen in the life of the individ- 
ual. How often does one hour of memorable conflict, of heart- 
breaking sorrow, of overwhelming responsibility transform the 
careless, laughing boy into the mature and thoughtful man, 
or change the strength and vigor of maturity into the feeble- 
ness and decadence of age. In these momentous periods a 
day may do the work of years. We measure them “by heart- 
beats, not by figures on a dial.” 
So, in the normal development of national life, even the 
careless student of history notes long periods of rest, stability, 
fixed conditions, dominant conservatism, during which the 
forces of change seem dominant. Then, ofttimes suddenly 
and without warning, the crust of established habit and fixed 
forms is torn to pieces as by a voleanic outburst. The hitherto 
solid ground is rent, the ancient landmarks disappear, old opin- 
ions, creeds, usages, standards, habits, prejudices, social forms, 
are fused into a fluid magma to re-crystallize into new forms 
of individual and national life. 
These are the turning points in a nation’s history, when 
?

every hour is big with fate, and the Eternal Future is molded 
on the clanging anvil of the Present. 
Such is the crisis, my fellow citizens of the South, through 
which the fair land of our birth is passing today. Like some 
gallant ship, freighted low with her precious cargo, following 
the chart of her fathers, she has for generations kept her 
straight course through storm and calm. Now, amid the 
rattle of machinery, the roar of her engines, and the feverish 
activity of the crew, she is tacking ship, and swinging outward 
with increasing speed over a new and untried course. 
The very bustle and activity which accompany the move- 
ment so absorb the attention that some of us may not realize 
the fact that this is a momentous transition-period in the life 
of the South, that the habits and ideals of a whole people are 
being transformed in a single generation. 
  
The old isolation of the South is forever at an end. Her 
position, the homogeneity of her people, the institution of slav- 
ery, the criticism of her neighbors, all conspired to keep the 
old South apart from the rest of the civilized world. 
Now, we are plunged pell-mell into the rushing current of 
the world’s life and thought, our expanding trade is bringing 
us into close relationship with every country on the globe, and 
when the great canal is dug, the South will be the gateway of 
the commerce of the world. 
The old social and domestic life of the South is being trans- 
formed before our eyes. Her rural life, her country homes, 
the old household with its retinue of loyal family servants, 
the quiet village where all were neighbors—these have given 
place to the hotel, the club, the city flat, the swarming tene- 
ment village, the rented house, and hired help. 
The old quiet, agricultural life of the South has given place 
to a very fever of modern industrialism, a delirium of money- 
making. Our blue sky is darkened by the smoke of countless 
factories, our villages are becoming cities, our railways are 
clogged with freight, and the very children begin to talk of 
stocks, bonds, profits and dividends. 
The old poverty of the South, whose stern tuition taught 
many a lesson of heroic self-sacrifice, is gone forever, and our 
people are intoxicated with this new wine of luxury and in- 
creasing wealth. 
With this rushing flood of Mammon worship has sprung up 
@.
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 SournERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
a new cult—the worship of Success. Our fathers bowed at 
the shrine of Character, they admired a man for what he was; 
the new South has enthroned Achievement and asks first what 
a man can do or has done. 
These idols of the marketplace have been set up in the very 
temple of learning, and are altering the whole spirit and ideal 
of education. The old cultural education is giving place to 
industrial training, and a score of orators are lecturing through- 
out the South on “The Money Value of an Education.” 
The system of Southern education is changing even more 
rapidly than its spirit. The great American public school 
system, undervalued and condemned by our fathers, is develop- 
ing on our soil like a banyan tree, and taking possession of 
every grade of instruction from the kindergarten to the uni- 
versity. 
The politics of the South is also in unstable equilibrium, in 
a transition stage. Although forced by the overwhelming 
menace of her great problem to vote as a unit in local matters, 
any tyro can see that the so-called solid South is today, on all 
national questions of government and finance, a liquid sea, 
whose bewildering tidal currents not even the professional poli- 
tician can predict from one presidential campaign to another. 
Nor has the all-pervading spirit of change spared the spir- 
itual, ethical, religious life and thought of the South. Her 
old-fashioned reverence for religion, for ministers and churches, 
for God’s Word and for the Sabbath day, is being undermined 
and swept away by a flood of new ideas, new standards, new 
doubts, and a new cosmopolitan indifference. 
So, in these piping times of peace, amid the stir and bustle 
of trade and commerce, and the busy hum of a thousand fac- 
tories, the South is once more a vast battlefield, and on the 
issue of the conflict is staked the future character of her civ- 
ilization. 
In pressing home the pregnant importance of such a crisis 
in our national life, let me not be misunderstood. It is no 
time for pessimism, for helpless repining, or for discourage- 
ment. Such a period is a bugle-call to action that should stir 
the most inert to patroitic service. It is a time when old 
chains are broken, old anchors weighed, old barriers swept 
away; when the hard crust of tradition and inherited prejudice 
is melted; when men’s minds are plastic, mobile, impressible. 
It is a time for hopefulness as well as for activity; when
-P-A-G-E-153
  A Pia For Some Op IDEALS 153 
long-standing evils may be annihilated, hoary wrongs righted, 
and useless lumber cast aside; when willing hands can be 
trained to higher service, willing feet led into better paths, 
willing minds and hearts stirred to a loftier purpose. 
Yet no one can deny that it is a time fraught with danger 
to all that is purest and highest and most distinctive in South- 
ern civilization, and before this audience I wish to make a plea 
for some of the old ideals of our fathers, for the chivalry and 
courtesy and open-hearted hospitality of the Old South, for 
the old spirit of reverence—reverence for womanhood, for the 
Word of God, for sacred things, for the marriage bond, for 
manly virtue and maidenly purity. I plead for the inwrought 
religious spirit of the Old South, its sense of personal dignity 
and personal honor, its lofty scorn of falsehood, trickery and 
meanness, its ethical standards, and code of personal morality. 
I wish to reaffirm what the Old South believed in the time 
of her greatest glory, and what the shades of her mighty dead 
still teach from storied urn and monumental granite—that the 
foundation of all true greatness, whether of an individual or a 
nation, is moral, not material. Our possessions, our houses 
and lands, our railroads and factories, our cannon and battle- 
ships, are but dirt—among them national character rises like 
a marble shaft amid piles of rubbish. The question of deepest 
moment is not what we have but what we are. National 
wealth may come and go, national power may wax and wane; 
the passing centuries are changing national customs in dress, 
manners, architecture and modes of government—but the great 
moral judgments of the world, moral standards, moral laws, 
moral ideals—these stand unchanged from age to age. They 
are like some granite cliff, overlooking a stormy sea. At its 
base the tide ebbs and flows, the sea ripples in music or roars 
in anger; its summit is covered alternately with summer’s 
flowers or winter’s snow, against its rocky face the sun shines 
or the tempests beat—yet earthquake and storm but settle it 
more firmly on its eternal base, and when each short-lived 
tumult has subsided, it still looks out unchanged over land and 
sea. No transient splendor of accumulated wealth can make 
a nation truly rich or truly great. Its dnvisible assets must be 
counted up—civie honor and purity, height of national ideals, 
capacity for heroism and self-sacrifice, commercial honesty and 
domestic virtue, diffused moral culture, treasures of manhood 
and womanhood—these can not be measured by long lists of  
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
industrial enterprises, by so many dollars per capita of manu- 
factured products, nor even by percentages of literacy and 
illiteracy. 
The present industrial prosperity of the South is the wonder 
of the world, our people are intoxicated with money-making, 
the smoke of our factories darkens the sky, and our financial 
strength is growing by leaps and bounds. 
Yet when was the South richest? In the political economy 
of heaven, judged by its unerring standards of value, taking 
stock of all her assets, visible and invisible, tangible and in- 
tangible, material and spiritual, temporal and eternal, when 
did the sum total reach a maximum ? 
I believe in my soul it was amid the gloom and horror of 
defeat in 1865. We picture the South of that momentous 
time as “ruined,” “devastated,” “impoverished,” and so in a 
shallow sense she was. Her man-made wealth was gone, her 
industrial system annihilated, her long-established social order 
shaken to pieces, her stately homes in ruins, the flower of her 
manhood dead on the field of honor, and the right of self- 
government torn from her grasp—the sun of her great na- 
tional hope had set behind the hills of Appomattox, night and 
chaos had come together, and amid the appalling wreckage of 
the past she faced a future through whose darkness no eye could 
discern the glimmer of a coming day! 
Yet, here, as everywhere, adversity wrought a glorious work. 
Those four years of conflict and disaster, of hopeless struggle 
against a world in arms, of bitter loss and stern self-denial, 
bred in the South a race of heroes. This furnace of afflic- 
tion, these rough blows on the anvil of war added to the old- 
time chivalry and grace of the South the vigor and resilience 
of tempered steel. : 
So, when the darkness fell, the Southern heavens blazed with 
a constellatiton of starry virtues never seen by day. Forti- 
tude grown superhuman through years of suffering, self-sacri- 
fice become a second nature, courage nurtured into sublimity 
by ceaseless conflict with overwhelming odds, love of country, 
always burning in the Southern heart, now blown by the breath 
of War into an all-consuming flame, fraternal feeling height- 
ened and glorified by constant comradeship in suffering and 
partnership in noble deeds, resignation taught by unspeakable 
loss and bereavement, religious reverence grown habitual 
through the constant presence of death, glorious womanhood

A Prea ror Some Otp IDEALS 155 
that buried the dead, nursed the wounded, cheered on the liv- 
ing, sacrificed all for the Cause, and crowned with her love and 
sympathy the heroes of defeat, purified and ennobled manhood, 
that left the inspiration of battle-flags and martial music for 
the harder task of rebuilding the devastated South and pre- 
serving her civilization amid the horrors of reconstruction— 
These were the assets of the Old South, her priceless treas- 
ures piled high in the Bank of Heaven, when the maelstrom 
of war had engulfed all her material possessions. Will the 
children of the new era retain them amid the intoxication of 
growing wealth and luxury? Prosperity is a severer test of 
a people’s true character than adversity. Will the New South 
stand the tropic sunshine as their fathers did the storm? Veg- 
etables grow best in sunshine and balmy air; the finer growths 
of manhood, alas! are often blighted by the sun, and wither 
away under a cloudless sky. 
If the old spiritual and moral ideals of our people are to be 
replaced by cold, shrewd, tireless, triumphant commercialism ; 
if liberal culture, ethical standards, and true moral greatness 
are to be sacrificed on the altar of Mammon; if growing 
wealth and luxury are to culminate in gross materialism—then 
God pity the land of Washington and Jefferson, of Lee and 
Jackson! In that case, though our air is vibrant with hum-

tional prosperity. With all my heart I congratulate the South 
on the swift development of her resources and the marvelous 
activity and success of her new industrial life. I rejoice in 
the fact that the day of her long and bitter struggle with crush- 
ing poverty has passed away forever, and that the wealth of the 
world is beginning to fill her coffers. | Yet God forbid that 
the children of the New South, intoxicated with this new wine 
of wealth, should think that a nation’s greatness is measured 
by dollars per capita, and should throw away, as out of date, 
the priceless spiritual treasures, the family jewels of the old 
home, because, forsooth, their setting is a little behind the 
times. 
We may grow so broad as to lose all our height—so tolerant 
and appreciative of all religions as to have none of our own—

power of making money, and to feel amply repaid for the loss 
of manly honor or the fair fame of womanhood, if the courts 
but assess sufficient damages—so deafened by the ceaseless chat- 
ter of our factories as to be unable to hear “the choir invisible, 
Whose music is the gladness of the world.” 
Our cosmopolitan visitors, while admiring our growing com- 
merce and expanding industries, smile at our old-fashioned 
ideas of morality and religion, and declare that the South, in 
these matters, is still fifty years behind the times. Yes, in 
some things, thank God, we are not yet up-to-date. The South 
in many ways is an old-fashioned part of the country—hope- 
lessly so, we trust. 
It is still, in the main, a land of old-fashioned people who 
make their money slowly and honestly, and leave their doors 
unlocked at night, of old-fashioned homes where husbands and 
wives love one another in the old-fashioned way, and are simple 
enough to live together till death breaks the old-fashioned bond. 
It is a land of old-fashioned ideas of womanly proprietey, and 
of a medieval reverence for womanhood now hopelessly out 
of date. 
Above all, it is a land of old-time religion, where atheists 
are unknown, and a minister is reverenced just because he is 
a minister, and | every word of the Bible is thought to be true; 
where the little children say “Our Father” every night at their 
mother’s knee, and are old-fashioned enough to keep on saying 
it till their own steps are tottering and ‘their hair gray. It 
is a land of old-fashioned death-beds, made radiant and tri- 
umphant by the antiquated notion that a blood-bought soul is 
going home to glory, and of old-fashioned comfort and resigna- 
tion, which, ignorant of Evolution and the Reign of Law, lifts 
its streaming eyes to heaven, lays its throbbing heart on the 
bosom of Ramla love, and says, “It is the Lord; let Him do 
what seemeth unto Him best.” 
Let the utilization of our wonderful natural resources con- 
tinue, let mighty industrial enterprises testify to the ability of 
our citizens, let the land echo with the throb of engines and the 
rattle of machinery, let every mountain cataract be yoked to 
the service of man, let our wide fields grow whiter with fleecy 
cotton, more golden with ripening grain, more stately with 
waving corn, smiling back in still more fruitful beauty to our 
sunny skies. Let the wealth of the world flow through a thou- 
sand channels among our people till leisure, and culture, and

material comfort lift the heavy burden of hopeless toil from 
every home! But let the old personal honor and personal dig- 
nity of our fathers be the heritage of their busier sons; let the 
old-time courtesy and hospitality hold its place in spite of busi- 
ness cares and sordid haste to be rich. Let the scorn of the old- 
time gentlemen for trickery and meanness and ill-gotten wealth. 
hold our generation back from the temptations of modern busi- 
ness life; let the old moral and ethical standards of the South 
prove a bulwark against the onrushing flood of luxury, frivolity 
and shallow Mammon-worship; let the ingrained reverence and 
spiritual insight of our fathers still touch the petty things of 
everyday light with a glow from the skies. And above all, let 
the deep religious spirit of the Old South consecrate her wealth 
to the service of God and man, purify her politics, her homes, 
and her ideals, sweeten into loving fraternity the relationship 
of rich and poor, make her future civilization the blessing and 
admiration of the world, and yoke her material destiny to the 
chariot wheels of the eternal purpose.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN LOCAL TRAINING 
SCHOOLS. 
By SUPERINTENDENT J. H. Puitxies, Birmingham, Ala. 
The preparation of the teacher is one of the fundamental 
problems of present-day education. There was a time, and 
that not very long ago, when the sole requirement for teaching 
consisted of text-book knowledge. Even yet the idea is too 
prevalent that the essential condition for entrance into the 
teaching profession is ability to pass the required state examin- 
ation, and that students direct from the high school or the fe- 
male seminary are prepared for entrance into the ranks of 
teachers. In too many of our normal schools and summer in- 
titutes the chief interest of the young teacher is preparation, 
not for teaching, but for examination. In a sense, this fact is 
to be deplored, yet in a particular stage of the teacher’s devel- 
opment it may be regarded as natural and quite necessary. Es- 
pecially is this true where the opportunities for academic train- 
ing have been limited. But the training of teachers today does 
not mean mere academic training; it does not mean mere ability 
to pass the required examination. It includes these, plus some- 
thing else; and in this something else, is involved the real suc- 
cess of the teacher and the true progress of the school. 
Among the several agencies for the preparation of teachers, 
the local training school occupies an important place. In many 
of our cities, a very large percentage of the teachers of ele- 
mentary grade are obtained from the local normal training 
school. In some city school systems all the teachers, with rare 
exceptions, are their own products. It is well to note at the 
outset that there is a broad distinction between the local train- 
ing school and the state normal school. The former is the out- 
growth of the specific needs of the local school system. In its 
origin it is the offspring of the teachers’ meeting and the Sat- 
urday Institute; it would never have been called into being but 
for the fact that intelligent supervision had demonstrated the 
need of special preparation. The normal school, on the other 
hand, is usually the creature of the state, and as such, essays 
to cover a wider field, and professes to give a more general and 
a more comprehensive training. It must provide for the needs 
of all the schools of the state, rural as well as urban. The local 
training school is limited in the scope of its training to local 
needs and requirements. To this limitation may be attrib-
-P-A-G-E-161
TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN LocaL TRAINING ScHOOLS 161 
uted both its conspicuous advantages and its most glaring de- 
fects. 
In this paper I shall treat the topic under three divisions— 
the advantages, the defects, and the essential conditions of the 
local training school. 
I. Specific Advantages— 
The training of the pupil teacher is consecutive. There is 
no abrupt transition from the academic work of the high school 
to the professional course of the training school. The school 
system is an organic whole, and the mechanism of all its parts is 
constructed with special regard to harmony and consistency. 
When the pupil teacher enters the training school she is already 
familiar with the methods and requirements of the elementary 
schools. Her personal knowledge of the facts and conditions 
of the local school system constitutes a body of experience which 
will prove an excellent basis for specific professional work. 
During her elementary school she has passed through the hands 
of a number of teachers, and, consciously or unconsciously, 
she has formed a sort of composite ideal of what the teacher 
of an elementary school ought to be, at least on the practical 
side. She has profited by the cultural development of the high 
school and is now in a mental condtion to enter upon a sys- 
tematic study of the principles underlying the concrete facts 
with which she is so familiar, and is prepared to develop into a 
more complete outline the ideal already formed. The local 
training school has a very positive advantage in thus dealing 
with pupils who have already traveled over the precise road, 
whose difficulties and intricacies are to be explained. 
2. The second advantage of the local training school is the 
fact that the preparation is for specific work. In this respect 
it has a distinct advantage over the state normal school. The 
young pupil at eighteen years of age is too immature to apply 
the broad principles and generalizations of educational philos- 
ophy to an indefinite number of dissimilar conditions. The 
specific application of these principles to a set of known facts 
and conditions and to forms of organization already familiar, is 
comparatively easy, and enables the pupil teacher to gain 
definite power and practical skill in actual work. The more 
limited the field, the greater will be the skill acquired. 
8. In the local training school, the pupil teacher has the 
opportunity for testing her knowledge of methods and her 
power to apply principles, not in the usual model school, but in
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 SourHERN EpucarionaL ASSOCIATION 
one of the elementary schools of the city, where the conditions 
are normal. The model school of the state normal may be an 
ideal school; it may serve an excellent purpose, but it seldom 
presents normal conditions. A class in one of the elementary 
city schools, on the other hand, is apt to present conditions that 
are natural; here the pupil faces the precise difficulties she 
must overcome as a teacher. There is a distinct advantage in 
thus grappling with these real difficulties under the direction 
and supervision of a critic teacher upon whose skill and helpful 
sympathy the pupil teacher may rely. The pupil teacher whose 
observation and practice have been confined to the model school 
is apt to be disappointed and disappointing, for a time at least, 
when suddenly plunged into the real difficulties of an actual 
everyday school. 
4, The local normal training school exercises a wholesome 
influence upon many pupils in the high school, and even in the 
elementary school. A pupil, even in the primary school, may 
look forward and find through the training school a definite 
avenue to practical usefulness. The purpose of the pupil is 
often formed before the completion of the academic course, and 
much useful observation may be possible before the training 
school stage is reached. 
5. Another advantage is the fact that the training school 
may utilize the most promising talent in the high school. It 
places in the elementary schools those who are citizens—those 
who have social ties and who mingle with the people in helpful 
ways by participation in church and Sunday school work, and 
other community interests. This often serves to interest many 
people in the schools who otherwise would be indifferent. 
II. Special Defects— 
While we may credit the local training school, as an agency 
for the preparation of teachers, with peculiar advantages, we 
must not overlook the fact that these very advantages involve 
certain glaring defects, which have a tendency in the course of 
time to introduce deterioration and weakness. It is true that 
these dangers may be obviated by judicious management, but 
we can scarcely expect to find in the changing administrative 
bodies of our cities the uniform wisdom, strength and courage 
that will check the dangerous tendencies inherent in a system. 
There are at least two serious dangers involved in the operation 
of the local training school, against which the authorities must 
constantly provide.  
-P-A-G-E-163
TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN LocaL ‘TRAINING |SCHOOLS 163 
1. In the first place, the tendency to take all, or a majority, 
of the teachers in a city school system from the training 
school ultimately leads to uniformity in thought and meth- 
od, and correspondingly dwarfs the processes of the school into 
a lifeless machine. The pupil passes through the element- 
ary school, graduates from the high school and enters the 
training school. At the end of one year, or possibly two years, 
she goes back as a teacher into the same elementary school, 
carrying with her a professional equipment that is identical 
with that under which she was taught. Methods of work are 
repeated and old devices are continued from year to year. The 
system tends to reproduce itself and revolves about the training 
school as a center without substantial progress. To counteract 
this tendency it is of the highest importance that the faculty of 
the training school shall be alert and progressive, keen to detect 
shams and weaknesses and ever ready to accept and assimilate 
new ideas. On the other hand, it is imperative that not more 
than one-half of the new teachers elected from year to year 
shall be selected from the graduates of the local training school. 
The other half should be selected by examination, or other- 
wise, from those who have had successful experience elsewhere, 
from graduates of state normal schools, or from graduates of 
training schools of other cities. If it could be found practica- 
ble, an exchange of training school graduates between two cities 
would be an excellent plan. At any rate, care should be taken 
to provide for the circulation of new, fresh blood in the school 
system and to prevent stagnation and degeneration. 
2. The second defect of the local training school is the nar- 
row scope of the work for which the teacher is trained. Pupils 
will enter the training school from the local high school, because 
they regard it as an easy channel for entrance into the ranks 
of teachers; they neither expect nor desire to teach anywhere 
except in their home city. They have studied only in their 
home schools, and there they intend to teach. This process 
is extremely narrowing in its influence upon the character of 
the teacher. Besides, the course of study in the training 
school, having special reference to the schools of the system 
of which it is an organic part, necessarily narrows the scope 
of the teacher’s training to local conditions and requirements. 
While this fact may prove a temporary advantage to the young 
teacher, in the end it is apt to prove a misfortune to the teacher 
herself, as well as to the children under her charge. Such a 
teacher usually has no idea of conditions elsewhere; she is help-
-P-A-G-E-164
164 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
less in a rural school, because she is wanting in independence 
and initiative. While apparently successful under the precise 
conditions for and in which she is trained, she is a pronounced 
failure the moment those conditions are changed. I have seen 
teachers who could work smoothly and happily so long as the 
mechanical conditions of the school were adjusted to their 
preparation, but who became dismal and unhappy failures 
when those conditions were modified. They lacked breadth of 
vision, as well as breadth of training; they were wanting in 
flexibility and in the power of self-adjustment to varying ex- 
ternal conditions. To obviate this narrowing and dwarfing 
tendency, it is of the greatest importance that the course of 
study in the training school shall be broad and comprehensive, 
and that it shall cover a period of not less than two years. It is 
equally important that the field of observation and practice 
opened up for the pupil teacher during her course of training 
shall not be confined to the city school system in which she was 
trained. Arrangements should be made by which a class may 
have a part of its practice in the schools of other cities and in 
the nearby rural schools. By such means, much may be done 
to develop the power of adjustability to varying conditions. 
III. Conditions of Successful Work by the Training School— 
I shall now submit briefly a few of the conditions essential to 
the successful conduct of the local training school as an agency 
for the preparation of teachers: 
1. The first essential for admission into the normal training 
school, naturally, should be scholarship. Unless this element 
of preparation is assured at the outset, both the teacher and the 
school system must suffer. Consequently, graduation from the 
high school, or from some school of equal or higher grade, 
should be a prerequisite. 
2. Scholarship alone should not be accepted as sufficient evi- 
dence of the applicant’s fitness for the work of the teacher. In 
view of this fact, it is wise to provide for another entrance 
qualification to the training school. Only those graduates 
should be accepted who are recommended by the high school 
faculty as peculiarly adapted, not alone by scholarship, but by 
mental and moral characteristics, by spiritual as well as intel- 
lectual qualifications. Many parents desire that their children 
shall become teachers, and dedicate them at an early age to that 
profession, either because it elevates them to a place of honor in 
the community, or because it appears to them to be a sort of
-P-A-G-E-165
TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN LocaL TRAINING SCHOOLS 165 
decent way of making a living. These children often come 
from homes of little culture, and beyond the knowledge ac- 
quired in the schools—a knowledge often poorly assimilated, 
they are in no wise fitted for the duties and responsibilities they 
seek, Some method of separating the grain from the chaff is 
indispensable, and, hard though it often may prove, the doors 
of the training school should be closed against those not fitted 
to enter. 
3. During the course in the training school, some pupils 
will develop inaptitudes or general incapacity to meet the re- 
quirements of the school. Such pupils should be kindly advised 
by the principal to withdraw before graduation. Such advice 
is a duty the principal owes to the pupil teacher, as well as to 
the schools. 
4, It is not the purpose here to outline a course of study to 
be pursued in the training school. Briefly stated, such a course 
should include the theory of education, a course in psychology, 
and a review of the subjects of the elementary school with 
special reference to methods of presentation. Lastly, a thor- 
ough and comprehensive course in the history of education 
should be given, which would enable the student to understand 
the evolution of educational methods. 
5. The practice department of the school is an important 
factor. The practice should be concurrent with the work in 
theory. It should be comprehensive, involving all the element- 
ary grades of the schools, and, in addition, the work of the 
ungraded rural schools. The work should be done under the 
criticism of a skilled critic teacher, or under the direction of 
the principal of the school. In some instances, the pupil 
teachers may act as substitutes, taking the places of absent 
teachers. In such cases, the principal of the school becomes 
the critic and his written report to the principal of the training 
school may prove a practical and helpful factor. The course 
of study in the training school, includingethe theoretical and 
the practical work, should require at least two years for its 
completion, and the pupil teacher should be at least eighteen 
years of age when she enters upon the course. 
6. Graduation from the training school carries with it no 
claim upon a position in the schools. The city has given the 
pupil teacher a full equivalent for the time spent in the train- 
ing school by affording opportunities for study and development 
under competent teachers. A board of education therefore has 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 SouTHERN EpuCcATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
a right to select the best only, and to reserve the right to install 
in the schools teachers whose experience and success elsewhere 
have demonstrated their fitness. It should be an inflexible rule 
that not more than fifty per cent. of the new teachers required 
for the schools annually should be selected from the graduates 
of the normal training school. Such a provision will in the end 
prove to be the salvation of the schools. 
In conclusion, permit me to attest the conviction, based upon 
personal experience, that the advantages of the local training 
school largely outweigh and outnumber its disadvantages. So 
long as our State Normal Schools are unable to supply the 
demand for efficient teachers, I believe that a city training 
school is a necessity. Not alone from a professional and a 
pedagogical standpoint, but also from an economic point of 
view. The local training school, properly administered, care- 
fully guarded, and wisely directed, is a profitable investment.

ROOM. 
M. Bares STEPHENS, State Superintendent of Maryland. 
Better school supervision may not be the most serious prob- 
lem with which the Southern Educational Association must 
deal, but there is practical agreement, I think, that it is one 
of the important questions which must be considered from time 
to time to the end that more effective supervision shall be guar- 
anteed to at least our rural schools. Many of the cities have 
and still are wrestling with the problem and the school author- 
ities, in many instances, have inaugurated means of supervis- 
ion which are fairly complete and quite effectual in securing 
better results. Our worthy president, Mr. Van Sickle, has 
evidently met with much success in solving this perplexing 
problem for the schools of Baltimore City; for with two assist- 
ants and twenty-three group principals, whose duties are almost 
wholly supervisory, he is enabled to know, through this net 
work of supervision, the conditions prevailing in any school 
room each day. We may regard this departure which he made 
in the beginning of his administration some six years ago as 
the most valuable of the many good reforms he has brought 
about for the school system of our metropolis.
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IN THE ScHooL Room 167 
Our delight at his success in this particular sphere may be 
tinged with selfishness since its provision has had a salutary 
effect on some of our county school officials. If, during these 
brief remarks, some references be made to the situation touch- 
ing this question in Maryland they must be excused on the 
ground that the conditions are most familiar there and the topic 
is now uppermost in our educational meetings. I am persuad- 
ed we are on the eve of better things, when closer school super- 
vision is considered, and already three counties have taken the 
initial step. 
The County Superintendent in our State, if not three per- 
sons in one, holds a position which demands the performance 
of three distinct sets of duties. He is also the Secretary and 
Treasurer of the County School Board which Board has charge 
of all educational matters affecting the County, receives all 
school moneys and disburses every dollar spent for the schools 
of the County. He also has charge of the distribution of free 
books and performs many other duties which attach to this 
many-sided position which do not strictly belong to a county 
superintendent. He is required to visit his schools twice a 
year and his limited time does not permit him to remain in 
one school room longer than two hours perhaps—not long 
enough to make his visit highly valuable to the teachers or 
satisfactory to himself. Hence this arrangement results in two 
serious objections, viz.: First, his visits are not frequent enough 
and cannot be made more frequent under existing conditions; 
and second, the time allotted to each visit is too brief to accom- 
plish fully the purposes of proper school supervision. If :you 
will pardon one personal reference I will say that for fourteen 
years I was the superintendent of the schools of my native 
county and visited them according to the requirements of law. 
The conviction grew year after year that where the average 
teacher needed the greatest amount of assistance, viz: in the 
work of the primary grades, I was least qualified to give it. 
1s this the experience of the average superintendent? If so these 
visits do not accomplish for supervision all that is essential, 
and it is proper to supplement this part of the county super- 
intendent’s work in order to make it more effectual. 
Nothing is meant to be said herewith in favor of discontin- 
ning the official visits of the county superintendent. He must 
have personal knowledge of the condition of the school grounds, 
schoolhouse, furniture and apparatus. He must acquaint him- 
self with the plans for heating and ventilating the school   
-P-A-G-E-168
168 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
rooms; inspect the register, observe the methods of the teacher, 
see that the requirements of the course of study are met, talk 
to the pupils, examine some classes, meet with the trustees or 
commissioners and explain their duties, and do many other 
things which are inseparably connected with such an official 
inspection. 
These observations are not directed against the county su- 
perintendent but against the system which makes so many 
other demands on this important official that he is left some- 
what powerless to properly observe the methods of teachers and 
train them into better methods. When this official takes charge 
of a school he prefers to conduct a recitation of one of the ad- 
vanced classes because less skill is required, and for it there 
is not so great a need for the artistic teacher; and when he 
leaves the room the teacher may be as helpless as when he came 
because he avoided those primary subjects and their methods 
which really make up the larger part of the teacher’s work. He 
may lack the time, or the inclination, or the preparation to meet 
that phase of the work and in very many cases there is an 
excuse and a good one, too, why he does not perform this part 
of his work more efficiently. 
Our prospect in Maryland for relief in this matter of super- 
vision may come from an unexpected source—the provision for 
manual iraining schools. The General Assembly has done much 
to encourage this new phase of school work as it is now possible 
for each county to establish one manual training center for 
white and one industrial school for colored children, the annual 
appropriations for these amounting to three thousand. dollars. 
This sum is large enough to employ an instructor for each de- 
partment, purchase the necessary material and also to pay the 
salary of a supervisor of primary manual training and eon- 
struction work. 
This supervisor visits whatever schools of the entire county, 
the superintendent may select. Three counties have in this 
way employed such supervisors, and they are proving valuable 
adjuncts in the matter of supervision. It may be well to say 
that these three persons are women, and in our judgment all 
such appointments should be made from that sex. Ostensibly 
they are chosen as inspectors of primary manual training (and 
they must be capable to do this part of the work well) but 
they are also required to be experts in primary school methods, 
generally speaking, because they become practically supervisors 
of primary instruction, with special emphasis laid on teaching

she is doing. She has entire supervision of all construction 
work and primary reading. She outlines plans and sends these 
to all teachers who have the primary grades; she has group- 
centers (about six for the county) and spends her Saturdays 
in meeting teachers of such groups; she gives instruction in 
primary teaching; shows how to carry on construction work in 
each school and how it may be correlated with other subjects; 
receives reports of the progress of the work and visits the 
schools as often as she can giving preference of course to those 
teachers who experience the most difficulty in applying her 
methods. She makes reports weekly to the County Superin- 
tendent of her visits. In the County Institute and in the 
Quarterly Association meetings she gives instruction. The 
work of the county superintendent, supplemented in this way, 
secures fairly effective supervision, and strengthens that part 
of his work which perhaps was weakest. 
In the absence of such an arrangement as has been cited, 
there should be employed for every county, where the county 
is the unit of the state system, a supervisor of primary meth- 
ods with readquarters in the primary school of the county seat, 
which person should direct this part of the work and visit what- 
ever schools the observations of the county superintendent may 
suggest. But, sad to contemplate, such adjuncts to school super- 
vision are only in fancy save some rare cases. It is still a con- 
dition and not a theory which confronts us and we must deal 
with the situation as it exists. The county superintendent, as 
the sole factor of supervision from a professional standpoint, 
must go on doing this work until an enlightened public opinion 
shall come to his rescue by declaring that it is poor economy 
not to spend more money in this direction. This very situation 
magnifies the position and makes it absolutely important that 
this official shall possess extraordinary qualifications. It stamps 
ae false the prevailing idea with many that the appointment to 
this position should go as a reward for some other form of 
activity than that in the sphere of public education. He should 
unquestionably have been a successful teacher, a student of ped- 
agogics, familiar with the history and science of education and 
such other professional subjects as are found in an up-to-date 
normal school curriculum. Unless he comes from the ranks, 
and with this special knowledge, he will be embarrassed as the 
leader and adviser of his teachers whether in the county insti-
-P-A-G-E-170

tute, the association meeting or the school room. We may all 
take courage from the signs of the times which point in every 
direction to greater precaution in the selection of this important 
school official. Fitness is now the passport to this place. 
Recently one of our county superintendents died very sudden- 
ly. The members of the appointing board asked me to join 
them in a conference to discuss a successor. We all thought 
after a serious consideration that the principal of the county 
high school, a young man of good scholarship, of progressive 
ideas and possessed of good common sense, was the logical person 
for the appointment. He had lived in the county but a few 
years and I believe his political affiliation or religious creed 
was not considered by a single member of the board. He stood 
at the head of his profession from virtue of the position he occu- 
pied and he was unanimously chosen. This is only one of 
many cases and merely shows the tendency everywhere to rec- 
ognize the public school forces and to select proper persons for 
this place. The most important work of this school executive 
is that which is involved in his official visits to schools. It is 
here that he is brought into closest touch with school work, here 
he meets school conditions as they exist and here that he is 
given his best opportunity to make his impress upon the edu- 
cational polity of the community. Before entering the school 
room he should carefully observe the school grounds and the 
exterior of the school buildings. No school house lot should 
contain less than one acre of land, and three acres would be 
much better for the purposes of the school. He should encour 
age the planting of shrubbery and of appropriate shade trees, and 
emphasize the need of school gardening where nature may be 
studied in the most effective way. There are many good rea- 
sons why the school property should be as attractive and beau- 
tiful as any other in the community. It is the home of the 
children for five days of the week; and the impressions they 
form here, from an aesthetic standpoint, will last a life time. 
The homes of many pupils are not such as to encourage high 
ideals in this regard and the school must supply this need which 
is a part of practical education. The school building should 
be attractive in appearance, located in a healthful spot and be 
well adapted to its intended uses. The county superintendent 
of course does not control these matters but there is much force 
in his suggestions; for after all many people are ripe for ideas 
which are suggestive. He must be ready to give advice regard- 
ing the building of proper schoolhouses and the best means to 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  Tue County SUPERINTENDENT IN THE ScHOOL Room 171 
beautify the school grounds. When he approaches the entrance 
he should rap and upon the door being opened he should greet 
the teacher politely and pleasantly. The few minutes he re- 
quires before entering upon the work of his visit should be 
given to a study of the wall decorations and pictures. He 
should commend all efforts to provide appropriate school room 
decorations and be prepared to discriminate between appropri- 
ate and inappropriate pictures. Children are susceptible to rec- 
ognition and the atmosphere of the school room may be made 
clearer and purer by shaking hands and chatting pleasantly 
with the pupils before beginning an inspection of school work. 
It is always a courteous thing, but often attended with design, 
for the teacher to say, “Now Mr. A, I would like for you to 
take charge of the school.” If Mr. A. is young and unsophis- 
ticated he may be caught in the trap—if a trap it be. It is 
one of the teacher’s devices if she wishes to conceal most effec- 
tively her work and keep in the background her methods. The 
spiperintendent should not take charge of the school. The reg- 
ular work should proceed in the hands of the teacher. How can 
he learn the teacher’s methods unless he observes how she 
teaches? So if his visit is to be fruitful, if he is to find out 
whether her methods and plans are pedagogical, he must desist 
from doing that which the teacher, more especially a poor 
teacher, would be delighted for him to do, viz.: take charge and 
conduct all the lessons. Apart from any consideration of this 
matter the county superintendent is not always prepared to 
conduct the immediate lessons of that day. He has not made 
that recent preparation which we all know is necessary to devel- 
cp a lesson properly. But before leaving the room he should 
do something along this line because the children expect it and 
the patrons might complain if he were not to do it. So to 
satisfy these two elements he is justified in making the depart- 
ure. He may also find it well to give a lesson for the benefit 
and instruction of the teacher. It may be a subject in which 
he is strong and the teacher possibly weak. Discretion must 
be exercised in giving such a lesson. It should not be for mere 
show. It often happens that the superintendent takes twice 
tke time which the teacher can give, tells some interesting 
stories and makes every step quite easy for the class. Then 
we hear the children when they reach their homes saying to 
the parents, “I wish Miss A could teach like the Superintend- 
ent.” You see the effect. The superintendent, in order to 
raake himself popular with the pupils or for other reasons has 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
172 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION } 
left the teacher with less power to do her work than when he 
found her. This is a mistake and should be guarded against. 
Not less than one half day should be spent in a school room. 
Teachers have their strong and their weak points in teaching. 
We want to observe the work in all the studies or we may form 
a wrong estimate. It would be wholly unfair to the teacher to 
allow our opinion to be formed after observing, for instance, 
the way she teaches geography. This may be her favorite . 
branch or it may be her Jonah. 
Much emphasis should be laid on the value of school discipline 
or training. Much care should be exercised to learn the means 
employed to inculeate good habits—how pupils conduct them- 
selves on the playground, and the quality of their conduct 
while in school. If they are not already a part of the school 
equipment, plans should be discussed for procuring a good libra- 
ry for the pupils, maps and charts and an organ. These belong 
te a complete school equipment and the superintendent will do 
much to provide these by impressing upon the teacher that he 
would like to see them or at least some of them when he calls 
next time. Before leaving he must give the teacher the results 
of his observations. He cannot do this before the school if they 
involve criticism. In such a case he should make a note of 
them in, his book and hand a copy to the teacher, so that when 
he makes his next visit he may easily refer to his suggestions 
and see how nearly they have been heeded. Fault finding is 
to be avoided. Teachers rarely if ever need scolding. Good 
work should be commended in the right way, and before the 
school; poor work should be quietly and patiently talked over 
with the teacher alone—the superintendent always remember- 
ing that for the teacher he must have i in stock and in abundance, 
unbounded sympathy. 
THE INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL TRAINING IN 
CITY SCHOOLS. 
CarteTon B. Gipson, Superintendent City Schools, Columbus, Ga. 
Nothing should be introduced into city schools or other 
schools which does not measure up to the standard of educa- 
tional value set for those schools. The standard may have been 
worked out and set up prior to or during our administration. 
The standard may vary properly in different kinds of schools
-P-A-G-E-173
  Tur INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL TRAINING IN Crry ScHoors 178 
from kindergarten to university. This test involves also a 
conception of education. Among the many definitions of edu- 
cation it may be safe to accept the statement that education is 
a preparation for life. Part of this preparation may be had 
in the university, part in the high school, part in the elementary 
school, part in the kindergarten, part in the nursery, part in 
the childhood of our grandfathers. Preparation for life may 
be taken to mean not simply the development of the facilities 
of the mind, but may have reference to one’s earning power, 
one’s ability to serve mankind and to make some contribution 
to the race. The development of mental strength and character 
building are involved in this preparation. But the education 
which aims simply at character building and mental strength 
falls short of its greatest usefulness. All educational work as 
it progresses should develop commensurate earning power and 
ability to serve mankind. ‘The economic value of manual 
training cannot well be differentiated from its educational 
value. As a pupil progresses in his manual training course he 
develops larger earning power which comes with the specialized 
motor training. In the kindergarten and primary grades what 
is sometimes called the purely educational value of manual 
training is more obvious, or perhaps we should say the econom- 
ic value of his manual training is less obvious. It has often 
been said that it is not the function of public schools to give 
the pupil a trade, but if in this industrial age giving the pupil 
a trade is a better manner of preparing him for life, the earn- 
ing power and ability to serve mankind, then it seems to me a 
legitimate function of the public schools to teach something of 
the trades. 
Local conditions must have some influence upon the schemes 
for education. The city in which one lives and reasonably ex- 
pects to live may have a certain dominant phase of life which 
is not found in all other cities, and this phase of life should 
have its influences upon the schools. Life in Pittsburg or 
Lowell or Birmingham is not the same as life in Nashville or 
Washington, and therefore the public education of Pittsburg, 
Lowell or Birmingham may well be different from the public 
education of Nashville or Washington. In the former type of 
city manual training in the public schools may be broader in 
its scope, and more extensive, and have more attention given to 
it than in the latter type. It is readily admitted that because of 
its value in motor development, manual training may well have
-P-A-G-E-174
174 SournEeRN EpucaTioNaL ASSOCIATION 
a place in every city school system. I take it that it is hardly 
necessary to define here manual training. Many definitions 
of recent years have been given, varying from that of the 
American Manual Training Association, which makes manual 
training any form of constructive work that serves to develop 
the power of the pupil through spontaneous and intelligent 
self activity, to that of the Manual Training Department of 
the National Educational Association, which makes it the 
transforming of materials by working with tools in accordance 
with principles fundamental in the industrial arts. The first 
definition looks to the directed self activity of kindergarten. 
The latter to the specialized manual training of the high school 
or the academic trade school. Manual training is no new 
thing, no fad. I have great respect for many things that cer- 
tain ultra-conservative people are ready to condemn as “fads.” 
The ery against fads has fallen on manual training, but like 
many other so-called fads, manual training, as a means of 
brain development and character building in the common 
schools, existed long before the word “fad” came into use. 
The early Greeks appreciated muscular work or exercise for 
its educative value. Plato in his “Laws” would have all the 
boys and girls given gymnastics for soul development. Aris- 
totle said: “The hand is the instrument of instruments, and 
the mind the form of forms.” 
The prevailing humanism of the seventeenth century yielded 
to the more pedagogic Realism, one of the distinguishing feat- 
ures of which was manual training as a means of education. 
Comenius, in many of his writings, urged the value of in- 
struction in the mechanic arts, but like many other great re- 
formers in the history of education, he did nothing to put his 
views into operation. This was left for his disciple Franke, 
who established at Halle in 1865 his Orphan House and his 
Pedagogium. In the former were taught during the third year 
fifty-one boys and twenty-five girls; forty-five of the boys had 
instruction in the mechanic arts and seventeen of the girls had 
instruction in domestic science or household economy. In his 
Pedagogium he had turning lathes and machines for cutting 
glass, in the use of which appliances, among others, persons 
were instructed so that they might teach manual training. 
This was perhaps the first normal manual training school. 
Through the agency of these trained teachers numerous schools 
sprang up, in which courses in manual training were given.  
-P-A-G-E-175
  Tun INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL TRAINING IN City ScHoots 175 
Hecker, in his Realschule, founded in Berlin, 1747, used 
manual training, one of the features of which was silk culture. 
It is quite evident that much of Hecker’s work in the school 
was for industrial education; that is, that the child might have 
a means of earning a living. 
Basedow, in his Philanthropinum, a school established by 
him in connection with Prince Leopold of Dessou, taught the 
use of tools. Thirteen children, including the son and daughter 
of Basedow, were found at work by a number of teachers. who 
visited his school in May, 1776. His ideas were had from 
Comenius and Rousseau. He says, in his Methodenbuch, “A 
boy whose acutest faculties are his senses, and who has no per- 
ception of anything abstract, must first of all be made ac- 
quainted with the world as it presents itself to the senses. Let 
this be shown him in nature herself, or where this is impossible, 
in faithful drawings and models. Thereby can he, even in 
play, learn how the various objects are to be named.” Comenius 
alone, he says, “has pointed out the right road in this matter.” 
In enumerating how the wretched exercises of the memory 
may be reduced, he gives as the sixth law: “The use of various 
tools is to be taught.” Quick says of the boys of Philanthro- 
pinum in Basedow’s time: “They became acquainted with 
both skilled and unskilled manual labor. Every boy was 
taught a handicraft, such as carpentering and turning, and was 
put to such tasks as threshing corn.” Basedow’s division of 
the child’s time was as follows: Eight hours for sleep, eight 
hours for food and amusement, and for the rich children, six 
hours of book work and two of manual labor; for the poor, 
two hours of book work and six hours of manual labor. 
Salzmann, who has been connected with Philanthropinum 
after Basedow’s time, founded in 1784 a celebrated school at 
Schenfenthal, which I believe is still in existence. Here’ he 
gave considerable attention to manual training, as did many 
others influenced by the Philanthropinum about this time. He 
seems to have had a higher appreciation of manual training 
for educative purposes than had Basedow. His school at- 
tracted increasing numbers of pupils and drew to it the atten- 
tion of the noted men of his time. Out of school hours, or the 
hours set apart for book study, the children were given instruc- 
tion in carpentry, basket making and gardening. 
Heinrich Heusinger, professor of Philosophy and Pedagogy 
in the University of Jena, developed considerably the idea of
-P-A-G-E-176
| 176 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
manual training and made it the central point of his school 
system. He sought, through manual training, to utilize the 
child’s own experiences and observations, for the sole purpose 
of quickening his mind. 
Blasche, who was one of the teachers in Schnepfenthal in 
1796, would make manual training his ‘very basis of intellect- 
ual culture,” for which purpose he would have it “an organic 
component of all instruction.” His aim, as he himself says, 
is to promote intellectual culture by means of mechanical em- 
ployment. 
For a time, until Froebel, Blasche, and Gutsmuths, his fel- 
low-worker, seem to have been the last of a line of educators 
who believed in manual training for intellectual development 
or educational purposes; and they ranked it higher in im- 
portance than any of the other means. Locke, Comenius, 
Rousseau, Basedow, Franke, Salzmann, Heusinger and Blasche 
emphasized more or less the purely educational side of practi- 
eal work. Locke, whose definition of education was “A just 
and legitimate familiarity between mind and things,” said in 
1693, “I cannot forbear to say that I would have him (the 
school boy) learn a trade, a manual trade; nay, two or three, 
but one more particularly. The busy inclination of children 
being always to be directed to something that may be useful to 
them, the advantages proposed from what they are set about 
may be considered of two kinds: First, Where the skill itself 
that is got by exercise is worth the having. Thus, skill, not 
only in languages and learned sciences, but in painting, turn- 
ing, gardening, tempering, and working in iron, and all other 
useful arts, is worth the having. Second, Where the exercise 
itself, without any consideration, is necessary or useful for 
health.” 
Rousseau in his Emile says: “If instead of making a child 
stick to his books J employ him in a workshop, his hands work 
to the advantage of his intellect, he becomes a philosopher while 
he thinks he becomes an artisan.” 
In considering the introduction of manual training into city 
schools it may safely be assumed that the average superintend- 
ent realizes its educational value and is able to block out a 
course of work. It is then his duty to make himself familiar 
with the trend of development in his section, and especially in 
his city. If this is preeminently industrial and commercial 
and numerous avenues are open to the young people of his 
   
-P-A-G-E-177
Tn INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL TRAINING IN Crry ScHoors 177 
section for honorable service in industrial and commercial 
pursuits, his course in manual training should be made accord- 
ingly. The ordinary common school branches with music and 
art, however well taught, will not always reach certain classes 
of children and educate them for life as well as certain forms 
of hand work indoors and out of doors. Large amounts of 
thought and energy and money are often spent in making the 
traditional public school as attractive as possible to certain 
large classes of children who do not appreciate the advantages 
of education and who will not attend the schools. Then the 
strong arm of the law is often used to compel those children 
to attend school. Many times with such groups of children a 
change in the form of educational work will reach them, in- 
terest them, hold them, develop them and turn them out into 
the world not only with a character built but with the means 
of earning their daily bread in some honorable pursuit. A 
certain quarter of the city may have a class of people entirely 
different from other quarters—different in temperament, dif- 
ferent in inclination, different in opportunity, different in the 
demands upon them in after life. These children may well be 
given a different form of education from that properly em- 
ployed in other sections of the city, and so it is the legitimate 
function of the city to establish special schools for special 
classes, where the conditions are such as to warrant it. 
Almost the entire South seems to be developing in an indus- 
trial manner and certain sections seem to outstrip other sec- 
tions. It is well, therefore, for those in charge of the great 
work of education in the South to recognize this in shaping 
their educational schemes. 
Germany has her industrial supremacy today because of the 
smartness and persistency of Kindermann and Wagamann 
about the close of the eighteenth century. The little mountain- 
ous country of Switzerland is indebted to Pestalozzi, Fellen- 
berg and Wehrli for the dexterity and productive skill of all 
her people. 
If we in the South would do something to prepare even in 
the elementary schools our children for serviceable living, we 
must do it largely through manual training.

MANUAL ARTS IN RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Frep J. Orr, State Normal School, Athens, Ga. 
This subject may be profitably discussed under three heads: 
I. The desirability of manual arts in rural schools. 
II. The phases of it most desirable. 
III. Practical methods of introduction. 
ne 
First, then, as to its desirability. 
The multiplying manufacturing interests in the South make 
it not only desirable but imperative. Between 1880 and 1900 
the South gained 348 per cent. in manufactures, while the 
rest of the country gained 242 per cent. Our commercial 
interests are thus becoming diversified. We are no longer 
strictly an agricultural people. The raw material from mine, 
forest and field is more and more utilized near at hand, and 
the export in future will become in growing percentage the 
finished product of workmanship rather than crude stock for 
mill men to develop outside our borders. 
Cotton is the chief resource of the South. To illustrate 
and stress the relation which manual arts in common schools 
bear to all Southern manufacturing interetss, cotton manufac- 
ture is adequaite, since it is typical of all industrial activity 
where producer and consumer are concerned. 
It is perhaps a truism to assert that “the enormous increase 
in the raw material is realized by the community in which it 
is manufactured.” It is pertinent, however, to inquire how 
it is that this is so. If we grow the cotton and if then in 
turn we ourselves make it into cloth what method shall we 
adopt to secure to our own pockets this enormous increase in 
value? We may turn for information to those countries 
where in the past and even now these tremendous profits are 
made. Why is it that French cotton goods, for example, bring 
so much /better prices in the markets of the world than Ameri- 
can cotton goods? That they almost eliminate us from com- 
petition is evidenced by the fact that our exports for 1904 in 
raw cotton amounted to more than sixteen times as much in 
dollars as did our exports of manufactured cotton goods. It 
must be evident, therefore, that Europe finds a larger sale for 
the products of her looms than does America. Why ig this?
-P-A-G-E-179
  MAnvuAL Arts IN RurAL ScHOOLS 179 
In answer, I wish to quote Mr. Edward W. France, di- 
rector of the Philadelphia Textile School. He says: “The 
foreigner has all our economic ‘appliances and he has also the 
skilled craftsmen, trained in the artistic branches which we 
have systematically neglected. He has watched our wonder- 
ful mechanical progress and has set himself to surpass us on 
other and perhaps more profitable lines. After a little careful 
study it was apparent that quality rather than quantity was, 
after all, the chief factor in the problem, and to attain suc- 
cess in this direction it was recognized as indispensable that 
not only the working classes but the manufacturers as well 
must be educated to higher and finer standards of taste than 
ever before. 
“Europe recognized long ago the supreme importance of edu- 
cating its people in the technical details of their vocations. 
And this has especially’ been true of textiles. Many schools 
have been established by the different governments for the 
diffusion of knowledge in the relation to this important branch 
of manufacture, and the claim that Germany’s supremacy in 
manufacturing is mainly due to her generous provision for 
systematic education of this kind, is heard on every hand, and 
is generally accepted as perfectly established. The lesson for 
American manufacturers is therefore very plain. If we ex- 
pect to win our way to the highest kind of success in textile 
production, we must build better in the years to come than 
we have built in the past; we should begin by making provision 
for industrial art and technical instruction in connection with 
the grammar grades. * * * It is in matters of taste that we need 
training the most; it is the artistic element that constitutes 
the charm of textile productions and enables the good goods 
to hold the market. No amount of cheapening of processes 
can compensate for the absence of this quality. * * * The infu- 
sion of this element of beauty into our products in the future 
means training im art for the men who are to do the work, 
and it can not possibly mean anything else.” 
Now it is to be noted that this eminent authority empha- 
sizes the fact that the education of skill and taste must begin 
in the primary school. It can not be relegated entirely to tech- 
nical schools, even if we had the latter in sufficiency—which 
we have not. And the argument has additional weight in the 
fact that it appeals directly to the economic needs of school 
communities. Of course the public at large must be educated
-P-A-G-E-180
180 SourTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
to see this. But this is a part of the duty of those of us who 
have the business of education in our hands. Public opinion 
may certainly be relied on to indorse a proposition after it has 
been demonstrated beyond peradventure that there is money 
in it. 
The reasons that apply to the textile industry are equally 
valid in connection with many other kinds of industrial devel- 
opment. It has been well stated that “a thousand nameless 
articles of luxury and convenience must still make a voyage 
across the Atlantic before we can use them.” 
Meanwhile a thousand and many thousands of the South’s 
youth drift into menial chance positions and year by year get 
less out of life—because of misfits in talent and occupation. 
A second reason why manual arts are desirable in rural schools 
is because of the foundation which they will inevitably lay for 
the perfection of workmanship in ordinary industrial oceupa- 
tions such as carpentry, plumbing, millinery, dressmaking, ete. 
It may be said at once that this is not the business of common 
schools, but rather in the province of purely technical schools. 
But it must be remembered that at present we have no: tech- 
nical schools of lower grade than the college; and the average 
school boy never gets in sight of such institutions. In the 
whole South the average citizen gets only three years of school- 
ing in his entire life. Many get more than this, but few reach 
real professional training in technological schools. Further- 
more, it is to be remembered that the very best thing that could 
be desired by technical schools is to have ordinary grammar 
schools lay preliminary foundations in technical skill. We 
must begin with primary schools. This fact is evidenced by 
the experience of every country that has tried it and profited. 
Again, a matter which may be mentioned in passing: The 
whole tendency of modern education for the negro is toward 
industrial occupations. If the movement progresses as every 
sign indicates that it will, a generation hence will find many 
negroes in the South trained to perform skilfully in many 
industrial vocations. At the same time, unless white men pro- 
vide the thing for which this paper argues, there will be many 
white men without skill of any kind. There can be only one 
result: the man best prepared to do the work will find employ- 
ment while the other man will work under his supervision. 
This seems to be the statement of an impossible condition in 
the South, but reasonable facts justify no other conclusion.
-P-A-G-E-181
  Manvuat Arts In RuraL ScHoors 181 
A third reason why manual arts are desirable in rural schools 
is because of their educational value. This has long since been 
demonstrated experimentally in a great many of the foremost 
schools and urged by foremost educators in America and 
Europe. 
In a recent utterance of President Eliott of Harvard in re- 
gard to drawing, which is one phase of the manual arts to be 
urged for rural schools, he says: “After reading, spelling, writ- 
ing and ciphering with small numbers and in simple operations, 
drawing should be the most important common school subject. 
* * * Tt is monstrous that the common school should give 
much time to compound numbers, bank discount, and stenog- 
raphy and little time to drawing. It is monstrous that the 
school which prepares for college should give four or five hours 
a week for two years to Greek, and no time at all to drawing.” 
The argument of Dr. Eliott is here explicitly placed on an 
educational basis. That is to say, he stresses drawing for its 
cultural rather than its industrial value. For, to quote further, 
he continues: “All children should acquire by use of the pencil 
and brush power of observation and exactness in copying, and 
should learn, through their own work, what the elements of 
beauty are. All children should learn how lines straight and 
curved, and lights and shades, form pictures and may be made 
to express symmetry and beauty. The main object in every 
school should be * * * to show children how to live a happy and 
worthy life inspired by ideals which exalt and dignify both 
labor and leisure. To see beauty and to live it is to possess 
large securities for such a life.”

Now, as to the kind of manual arts desirable for rural schools. 
This question must be answered in the light of what has just 
been read as to reasons for including the subject in the curric- 
ulum at all. To summarize briefly these reasons—they are: 
That manual arts may be so directed that their province is not 
alone industrial, not alone educational, but in a much broader 
sense inclusive of both of these functions. The question of their 
efficiency in this scope must depend finally upon the way they 
are presented in the school room. 
There have been advocates of manual training—meaning 
construction work with the hands, using card board, wood, 
metal, ete.—urging the subject purely for its disciplinary mind 
training. Others have stressed the disciplinary and cultural
-P-A-G-E-182
  182 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
values of art education—meaning drawing, color, clay model- 
ing, ete. But each of these classes of advocates have been 
careful always to eliminate any hint of an industrial charac- 
ter being given to any of this work. It is purely educational. 
I am convinced that this is a mistake for the South. 
All these processes of cultivating skill of eye and hand should 
be correlated, with the avowed intention of laying foundations 
for industrial schools, coincident with conferring mental cul- 
ture. 
Sweden was among the first countries to experiment exten- 
sively with wood and other construction work in her govern- 
ment schools. The Swedish sloyd—a dry system of abstract 
tool exercises entirely devoid of artistic treatment, has been 
introduced into America and other countries. Swedish sloyd 
doesn’t pretend to accomplish anything more than mental dis- 
cipline through the hand and eye. Is it surprising that the 
United States imported from Belgium in one year, wood manu- 
factures one thousand times the value of the same item from 
Sweden and Norway. The Belgians do not forget to stress the 
artistic. Nor have France, and England, and Germany. 
It is therefore plain that in the first place these subjects of 
wood work, clay modeling, drawing, color, ete., should be pre- 
sented in conjunction. They should be interwoven. And the 
artistic phase should receive emphasis at every turn. The 
student thereby gains mental discipline, manual skill and es- 
thetic culture, all of which better fits him for citizenship and 
industry. The intellectual side will be no whit weakened and 
the industrial side very much strengthened. 
To build up in the South a stable ground-work for artistic 
constructive ability will be by far the best thing that manual 
arts can do for the common school curriculum. 
But what is meant by correlated manual arts? Perhaps 
this may be illustrated by the character of the work at the 
Georgia State Normal School—an institution organized for the 
specified purpose of training teachers for the common schools. 
The expressed purpose of the course in manual arts is “To in- 
clude in every exercise, as far as possible, essential pedagogic, 
constructive and artistic principles and to endeavor to meet the 
practical needs of school communities as far as consistent with 
these principles.” 
Now, under this regime a student undertakes a problem in 
wood work. He is given an option in the prosecution of any 
one of several projects, but each of these must illustrate at
-P-A-G-E-183
Manuva Arts IN RvuRAL ScHOoLs 183 
least four correlations, viz.: Working drawing, color harmony, 
joint construction in wood, and original design. ‘The projects 
offered have also a second purpose, viz: That of illustrating 
in. complete form, utility and beauty; and they must be defi- 
nitely related to home environment looking to the improvement 
thereof esthetically. For example, an object offering in large 
measure these elements is a three panel screen, for use in a hall, 
bed room or dining room. The options in this problem are 
size, proportions, panel divisions, color scheme, method of dec- 
orating, material for covering, finish and cost. The require- 
ments are that if possible it shall be constructed for use in some 
particular place, the environment of which in color and finish 
is known. Also that certain specifled varieties of joints shall 
be used in its construction, and that the whole shall be embel- 
lished by some form of applied decoration involving an original 
design—as for example, a stencil on the cloth, or a space ar- 
rangement in applique, Or, it may be, a small panel of stained 
glass, the colors, lines, and spacing for which are studied care- 
fully. Or, a fourth method may call for a panel of bent iron, 
or burnt wood, or tooled leather. Whatever method of decora- 
tion is selected by the student, the net result is the same, psy- 
chologically—namely, the constructive imagination has been 
given active exercise and good taste cultivated. In working 
out these decorative treatments, drawings from nature by the 
student are used as motifs, and suggestions as to arrangement 
and application derived from the best examples of applied de- 
sign to be had, modern and historic. 
It is required of every student to make working drawings for 
every part of the construction, including details of joints which 
involve three to six views of projections for each joint. Also 
a color scheme showing ultimate effect desired in the whole 
when the decoration has been applied, wood stained, and screen 
finished. It is required that each of these steps in the proced- 
ure shall have been completed before the wood is touched. 
Then follows the actual construction with bench tools, of all 
the parts, and finally the scraping, putting together, and finish- 
ing with stain. 
Now the following points may be noted as to this method: 
1. Throughout the process receives more emphasis than 
the desirability of merely completing the object. 
2. The problem involves practice in the use of every instru- 
ment and every process that will be met by the student when 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
he comes to teach—or at least instruments and processes that 
are typical. 
3. No essential phase of manual arts work is relegated to 
a place by itself independent of other essential phases. All 
that are possible in this problem have been interrelated and 
worked together. 
4. The subject is made to reach and influence the homes of 
students directly. This screen will take its place in homes over 
the land and stand for artistic usefulness. It will incite to 
further improvement in home furnishings and is in some cases 
the means of remodeling and simplifying entire interiors. 
Now it may be urged that elaborate work such as that just 
described is not practicable for a small rural school. This is 
true, perhaps, so far as this specific problem is concerned. But 
problems can be selected throughout the course which will em- 
body the processes and principles here described, and this is the 
thing of most importance, anyway. The thing constructed 
should always be of secondary consideration provided only that 
it serves as a means by which technical skill and good taste are 
secured, through the exercise of hand and eye in manipulating 
pencil, brush and tool. 
The kind of manual arts desirable, then, is that which is edu- 
eative and disciplinary, but which also cultivates technical skill 
and taste. The dual function is thus served of training the 
mind through the hand, and also laying much needed founda- 
tions for future industrial occupation. 
IU. 
If it is granted that manual arts of the character just out- 
lined are good things to have in the rural school curriculum, 
the question of next importance is how it is to be introduced. 
Prejudicial public sentiment is the first obstacle. This will 
arise in general from the fact that education is not appreciated, 
and in particular this phase of it is not understood. The ques- 
tion of appeal immediately presents itself. How can the com- 
mon school patronage, which is oftener than otherwise unintelli- 
gent as to matters of education, be made to see that manual 
arts are worth an expenditure of time and effort, and even 
money. After all, the life of manual arts must depend upon the 
support it receives from public sentiment. Therefore this lat- 
ter must be nursed! And those of us who do believe in them, 
and see the far-reaching importance of them, must undertake to 
convince all comers.
-P-A-G-E-185
  Manvat Arts my Rurat ‘Scuoors 185 
In Hancock county, Georgia, Mr. M. L. Duggan, the County 
Superintendent of Education, has introduced manual arts in 
every county school under his charge, and the experiment has 
begun its third year of success. His experience shows several 
ways of winning the convictions and support of patrons; first, 
the promoter must understand and believe in what he is doing. 
Second, he must have the co-operation of tactful teachers who 
also understand and believe. Third, the products of the manual 
arts department must reach the homes of the children and 
prove at least useful, or, better still, of actual money value. 
If the course is conducted along the lines that have been de- 
scribed it is possible to find a market for products. Students 
in the Sophie Newcomb College at New Orleans are enabled 
to pay part of their tuition from the sale of the wares which 
they have designed in connection with their course of instruc- 
tion in art industry. The small school can do the same thing 
on a small scale. 
Using these expedients, objecting parents are led to see con- 
crete results. And the children, if guided by a skilful teacher, 
are rarely other than enthusiastic. They are therefore peren- 
nial arguments in themselves. 
It would not be wise, in pursuit of this policy of convincing 
parents, to lower the standard of work one whit. The ulti- 
mate goal of raising up a generation whose skill shall be trained 
and whose taste shall be cultivated should never be lost sight 
of. Nor would it be wise to lend much time and energy to the 
construction of knick-knacks—to tickle the doubtful tastes of 
those whose homes are even now too often cumbered with such 
things. Every time the standard of artistic excellence or the 
standard of teaching ability is lowered just for the sake of mak- 
ing a start or in order to save money, the whole cause is injured. 
But it may be said that this is discussing mere theory without 
possibility of practice, for even if the school community is will- 
ing, how can the expense be met? This is the second obstacle 
—cost. 
Quoting Mr. Duggan’s experiment again: He tells me that 
the county of Hancock furnished a shop equipment costing 
from $250 to $300. The county seat, Sparta, paid for a 
special building to be used for manual arts only, at a cost of 
$1,200. A special teacher who directs all manual arts work 
in the county is paid a salary of $900, part of which comes 
from the county board of education and part from the General 
Education Board of New York.
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Summarizing: The permanent plant cost $1,500, and the 
annual running expense is $900, exclusive of working mate- 
rials, which are furnished by students. This latter ought not to 
cost over $1.50 a year per student. 
The special teacher devotes two hours a week to each grade 
of the high school, in connection with which the manual arts 
course is conducted. Children from the county schools who go 
beyond the seventh grade are expected to attend this high 
school. By this means, and by conducting a regular course of 
instruction for the county teachers, meeting at the high school 
shop once a month, the entire county orpanization is reached 
with competent training. 
But a first investment of $1,500 and annual running ex- 
penses of approximately a thousand dollars is possible, perhaps, 
only by some such scheme of centralization or consolidation. 
It might not be possible to raise an amount of money in every 
case equal to that secured in this instance. If economy is 
necessary at the start it must be emphasized that the reduction 
should be made in the cost of equipment rather than salary of 
the teacher. The best of equipment will avail nothing in the 
hands of a teacher not qualified to direct its use. Nor will it 
be wise to introduce manual arts, even in their simplest form, if 
the regular corps of teachers must be forced -to teach a subject 
about which they are entirely uninformed. This is frequently 
done, and probably in every instance the cause has been in- 
jured. Results, under such a scheme, are unsatisfactory to all 
concerned—teacher, children and patrons. The absurdity of 
such a requirement on the part of school managements is so ob- 
vious that it seems strange that it should Pe er occur. 
The remedy is in normal schools. In the last analysis the 
normal school stands responsible for this desirable cultivation 
of skill and taste among the masses of the people. For it will 
be possible in exceptional eases only, to secure and pay for a 
special teacher even in the consolidated school. The time for 
this may come later. At present it is desirable to have the 
grade teacher prepared professionally to direct the manual 
arts of her grade. The normal schools must be relied on to 
provide this professional equipment. | 
Under prevailing conditions of peg ce schools, grant- 
ing that the teacher is prepared, manual arts in all the phases 
above described are possible of introduction at a total first cost 
of $200 to $300, including a small building to accommodate 
twelve work benches.

The question for school boards to consider, however, is not 
one of small expenditures as much as it is one of large economy. 
Indeed, it is a matter of fundamental social and economic im- 
portance, and the responsibility for its consideration should not 
be delegated.

PRACTICAL CHILD STUDY IN 
SCHOOLS. 
ELIZABETH MaAupE Hatry, Monte THE ELEMENTARY 
allo, Ala. 
From the mystical, magical East, guided by a beautiful, won- 
derful star, the wise men traveled far and long in their rev- 
erent, loving search for the young child; and, after more than 
nineteen hundred years, the greatest, most vital problem of the 
educational world and of the thinking love of trained parent- 
hood is the problem of the little child—what he is, what he 
ought to be, what he demands of us that he may realize his 
utmost possibility. 
The spirit of child study must indeed be scientific, based 
upon the thoughtful, er itical reading of those authorities, who, 
by their patient, original research, have earned the title of ex- 
pert in this line of study. The average 
the elementary school is not and can no 
her, “this exquisite lump of clay entruste’ 
of the divinity within,” parent or teacher in 
be an expert; with 
for the development 
must be studied, primarily, for the 
child’s own welfare; secondarily, for the guidance of the 
  parent or teacher in adjusting herself to the requirements of 
the child’s needs, and only incidentally in the interest of 
science. 
To accomplish these ends, there must be a critical spirit, not 
toward children, but toward articles hinedany about them, a 
judicial spirit which will search for opposite cases, for incon- 
sistencies, for unsupported statements. There must be, more- 
over, an abundance of common sense, delicate refinement of 
feeling, true sympathy, and, above all, pe 
with the children themselves. ‘Come, 
children.” 
To repeat somewhat, practical child 
schools, granting and requiring always its

study in elementary

and, for the best results, she must have the co-operation of the 
home. It is impossible for the school to work alone and do 
full justice to the child. The school has long been making re- 
ports to the home: the time has now come when the school 
should demand reports from the home. While it is true that 
mother love often blinds the eyes and stops the ears to the 
faults of a child, it is no less true that mother love gives a 
quickened vision that sees embryonic and hidden virtues and 
possibilities. The teacher, with her thirty, forty, fifty, chil- 
dren, has better perspective and a wider knowledge of child 
nature, but the mother’s is intensive study; and so each student 
can strengthen and supplement the other. 
Real education, that which is concerned not merely with 
what a child knows, but which values even more what he will 
be and do, demands that he shall be strong-limbed, clean-souled, 
vigorous in intellect, “reverencing his conscience as his king,” 
spontaneous, wholesome, fitted for life, his own best life. 
Since a child’s education should begin at least a hundred 
years before he is born, the wise teacher begins her study at 
the earliest possible moment. Before she enters her school- 
room, she finds out the ages of the majority of the children, 
their nationality, whether homogeneous or mixed, the indus- 
trial and social environment of the community, with its general 
tone of intelligence and culture. She learns something of the 
course of study and the methods of teaching employed in the 
school. She understands beforehand her own class room, with 
its possibilities and limitations, sanitary and artistic, as well as 
its material equipment. 
The study of the children themselves is an integral, insep- 
arable part of the teacher’s work from the hour when they 
make their first appearance, until, having been trained in the 
way they should go, they go forth forever. 
With the multifarious demands upon the teacher in our ele- 
mentary schools, she needs. to be alert to perceive and quick 
to judge. ‘That she may preserve her judgments, an invaluable 
aid is found in a card catalog of the pupils. For each child 
there is a card on which are recorded his name, age, and lead- 
ing characteristics, mental and physical, with any other per- 
sonal information which the teacher may wish to preserve. 
The filling out of the cards is, of course, a gradual process, and, 
from personal experience, I know that they are subject to re- 
vision and modification more frequent and sweeping than com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
190 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
plimentary to the correctness of our early impressions. In a 
written exercise, in a personal interview, or on the playground, 
the child reveals himself as he does not in an ordinary recita- 
tion, and it is a good plan to keep these cards in a convenient 
place to jot down, as they are made, judgments which might 
-otherwise be evanescent. Recording the student’s improve- 
ment or retrogression in work and in conduct, the cards serve 
as memoranda for his special needs, and they help in that con- 
summation toward which the schools are moving—the estima- 
tion of the pupil on the basis of his own make-up, his attain- 
ments being measured by his own previous accomplishments. 
With respect to the physical life of her pupils, the teacher 
should have as a standard for comparison the average height 
and weight of typical children of their age, with mean varia- 
tion in each case, and the normal yearly growth. Perhaps the 
best authority for these data is Dr. Boas, whose calculations are 
embodied in the report of the U. S. Commission of Education 
for 1896-97. If the teacher cannot easily think in terms of 
the Metric System, let her send to the Department of Com- 
merce and Labor, Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C., for 
~ a most helpful chart of this system and its better known equiv- 
alents, a chart which may be had for the asking. 
Some one has said that “the dull boy is a detective to find 
out poor teachers:’” the wise teacher will note his dullness and 
be able'in many eases ito trace it to some developmental effect, 
to low nutrition, or te defective nervous action. Often, to 
find the cause is to know the remedy. 
According to Dr. Francis Warner, the great London physie- 
ian and student of children, among the important signs of in- 
ferior bodily development which a teacher may detect are a 
cranium too large, too small, or ill-proportioned; a defective 
forehead, narrow, low, generally undersized, or bulging; a 
symmetry of the external ear; a too small face, ill-propor- 
tioned features, too small mouthysmall or ill-shaped openings 
of the eyes. r 
According to the same authority, some of the more evident 
signs of defective nervous action are unevenness in general 
posture; fixed or vacant expression of the face; over-action or 
uncontrolled action of the muscles of the forehead, arm, hand, 
and eyes; grinning; slowness in response to simple directions; 
defective speech. 
The teacher should be familiar with the evidences of health
-P-A-G-E-191
PRACTICAL Cuitp Srupy IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 191 
in childhood, and she should remember that school environ- 
ment and school sanitation are factors as vital as food and 
nutrition. It is better to increase the positive forces which 
make for health rather than to fight disease, and our school- 
houses should be as sanitary as our hospitals, for children are 
much more likely to take and spread disease than are patients 
and invalids. 
Among the evidences of health most significant and most 
easily observed are these: 
1. Activity, which should be reasonably controlled and 
directed to effective ends. : 
2. General appearances as to height, weight, coloring, ete. 
3. The normal development of sense powers, especially vis- 
ion and hearing. Sight and hearing should be tested, not to 
report the percentage of defect, but that each suffering eye and 
ear, if possible, may be remedied. A change of desk may often 
save a child from being misjudged and from falling into per- 
manent habits of inattention and carelessness, while, in many 
cases, the teacher discovers defects so serious as to require the 
treatment of the skilled specialist. 
4. Method of breathing. Mouth breathing is sometimes 
a mere habit, though it is more often caused by obstructions in 
the throat or nasal passages. To adenoid growths and 
enlarged tonsils, with consequent air starvation, are often due 
the two afflictions of deafness and dullness which usually dis- 
appear with the removal of the cause by a simple surgical 
operation. 
5. Poise of body. This is an evidence of positive power. 
A child who cannot control his muscles will probably be lacking 
in will power. 
6. Work done, as to amount and kind. 
7. State of appetite. There should be hunger, but not 
craving, for simple and substantial food at proper intervals. 
8. General disposition. Ill health is not the root of all 
badness but the child should be given the benefit of the doubt. 
9. Sleep, which should be sound and dreamless, or not in- 
terrupted by dreams. 
10. <A feeling of being rested in the morning. 
11. Absence of pain. It is not sufficient that this be mere- 
ly negative, but there should be a consciousness of well-being 
merging into a consciousness of power. 
A quick, observant, tactful teacher will have little difficulty 
in finding the evidences of health, but she must also watch for 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
192 SournERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
signs of ill health, mental as well as physical. When there is 
lassitude, she should investigate the child’s physical condition. 
Sometimes he is extremely fatigued because he has nothing to 
do, nothing that he thinks worth doing. As we ourselves 
doubtless remember from the habit of our childhood days when 
inhibition was affected mainly by negation, the feeling of con- 
straint, of restraint, with its consequent worriment, induced in 
us real fatigue. Try the better plan of inhibition by substitu- 
tion, arouse interest, give more work, and watch the results in 
the child who has been listless and idle. Guard against 
the dangers of over-stimulation, of the pseudo-strength which 
comes from emotional excitement, but remember that it is 
folly to stop either work or play because of its purely temp- 
orary effect. Fatigue and excitement are injurious only when 
they are excessive, when they last over night. 
The effects of discipline and punishment, of praise and 
blame, should be carefully noted, and the intelligent teacher 
should forever disabuse her mind of the error, hoary with age, 
that all the children must be treated exactly alike. The per- 
sonality, even of the little child, is sacred, and whatever the 
teacher does should be for the good of each pupil. 
Incentives, too, must be carefully studied. Under what con- 
ditions does the child most easily acquire permanent habits of 
industry and persistency? Does he need stimulation, repres- 
sion, or direction? Does he merely follow and imitate, or has 
he initiative? How can his talent for leadership be made a 
power for right living in work and in play among his fellows? 
What is the effect upon the class of a change in the program ? 
Upon individual pupils? What are the favorite studies? 
Why? Shall we judge by what the pupils say, or by their 
spontaneous attention, or by permanent results in memory 
and conduct ? 
To me the study of pupils’ mistakes has been peculiarly 
fruitful. Are these mistakes due to deafness or other sense 
defect, to inattention, to lack of mental content, to failure to 
see the essential point, or to my own carelessness in enuncia- 
tion or lack of skill in questioning? Many concrete illustra- 
tions come crowding into consciousness: the child who called 
“Dr. Peterson,” “Dash,” and was justified by the little class- 
mate who said, “Well, they have the same starting off” ; the lad 
whose apperceptive basis caused him to read the curse pro- 
nounced upon the first murderer, “He shall be a cucumber 
upon the face of the earth”; the boy who glanced significantly

at another when hespoke of Daniel Webster as eloquent: asked 
as to the meaning of the word, he laughed and said pretty; 
further investigation disclosed the fact that he had confused 
the words eloquent and elegant, and I could sympathize with 
his attitude toward the great orator’s personal pulchritude; the 
girl who, surprised in u test by a question as to the Triple Alli- 
ance, startled her teacher by the composite dictionary informa- 
tion that it was “a three-fold union in matrimony’’; the note 
under the picture of a famous structure in Venice—the Bridge 
of Size, a natural spelling in contrast to the “prison and palace 
on either hand” ; the innocent little girl at the head of her class 
of two who said when the second word i in the lesson was given 
to her to spell, “That’s not my word: it’s Jim’s”; the startling 
apparition, if the young girl really saw what she wrote about, 
“stretched upon his couch in slippered ease, the face of Mr. C 
was the picture of contentment”. 
But enough of these “mistakes in teaching”. 
These desultory suggestions for practical child study in ele- 
mentary schools must not close without reference to the ques- 
tionaires of Dr. Hall which are indeed stimulating and sugges- 
tive both as to subject matter and method of: inquiry into the 
content of mind. 
Other helpful works that I should like to recommend to the 
young teacher are Kirkpatrick’s “Fundamentals of Child 
Study”, Warner’s “Study of Children”, Shaw’s “School of Hy- 
giene”, and the papers and discussions from year to year in the 
Child Study Department of the National Edueational Associa- 
tion.   PLAY AS A FACTOR IN EDUCATION. 
MRS. J. H. PHILLIPS, OF BIRMINGHAM. 
. In approaching the subject of “Play as a Factor in Educa- 
tion,” we are met at once by a difficulty. What is play? 
Have our leading educators, those who decide what is what for 
us, settled upon a definition of play, or have they decided 
in what way play is differentiated from work? One says, 
“Play is the work of childhood.” Another, “Play is the heart 
of life, work is life’s brain.” A kindergartner says “play- 
work,” connecting them, while still others place them as dis- 
tinct opposites. I asked a rather tired looking mother of
-P-A-G-E-194
194 SouTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
several strong, healthy boys and girls what play. was, and she 
replied, “Oh, its wasting time, but they’ve just got to do it, it 
seems.” I asked one of her boys, and he said, “Its doing what 
you don’t hafter.” This boy’s answer has suggested a defi- 
nition that pleases me, and I hope it may please and satisfy you 
as well. It is this: “Play is the expression of the joyous 
spontaneity of childhood.” 
Real play must be spontaneous, and we quite agree with 
James when he places play in his list of “prominent tendencies 
which are instinctive in the human species.’”’ It is an instinct 
implanted in both man and animals and has distinet functions. 
In many ways it is undoubtedly nature’s plan of preparation 
for real work in maturity. The scientists who advance this 
theory will have many followers among those who are fond of 
watching the young animals as well as children in their play, 
although this same observation convinces us equally that much 
play is simply a joyous outpouring of exuberant spirits. 
Play is the child’s life from babyhood to the school age. 
His physical development and in no small degree his mental life 
as well, have been forwarded by this process alone. I refer to 
the average child in Alabama who has had neither the ex- 
perience of a kindergarten nor the training of the dancing 
school. It is through play that he has aequired the mastery of 
his body and what grace he may possess. By rolling, jumping, 
kicking and climbing, he has developed those muscles that he is 
to use now and later in efficient work. 
But is it wise that too much steady work be thrust upon 
these muscles and brain tissue at once? Can the primary 
teacher afford to ignore play as still an important factor in the 
child’s best development? The normal child comes from the 
home or the kindergarten as nature intended he should be, an 
active creature, and we strive at once to force him into a 
passive state. He must sit quietly for long periods with folded 
hands, not turning or even glancing from right to left. When 
he is allowed to move, it is to imitate us in. the movement of 
hands, arms and legs. And we call this recreation! We 
thrust formalities too quickly upon the child, we mold him 
after our own patterns, when heaven knows sometimes it were 
well that the pattern were lost, rather than spend time and 
energy searching for his individuality, even in play, and giving 
our thought to develop that. 
Physical culture or some form of gymnastics we do sub- 
stitute, but one wiser than I has said, “On account of their joy-
-P-A-G-E-195
  PLAy AS A Factor In Epucation 195 
ous, refreshing influence the place of games cannot be filled 
by gymnastics,” while others have placed play as a department 
of physical education. The play impulse, I believe, should 
have ample opportunity to express itself in free, spontaneous 
exercise, and every effort should be ‘made to secure play- 
grounds around every school house in the state for such play. 
The school rooms do net afford sufficient space. 
Play is so real to the child. He becomes for the time being 
the horse, the bird, the frog that he imitates. May it not be 
possible by thus projecting himself into the life and habits of 
the animals, that he develops a closer sympathy than we are 
able to arouse by stories intended to cultivate consideration for 
the brute creation ? 
In his reproduction of trades and occupations his heart is 
warmed towards those who contribute so much to our comfort 
and convenience. Many of us have been impressed by the 
look of reverence cast towards the motorman, after the small 
boy had been playing “street car.” 
It was in this game that I witnessed the most intense feel- 
ing on the part of a boy five years of age. The chairs were 
the cars that passed through the transfer station, without 
moving, of course. I was to be an old lady from the country 
who did not know the streets very well, while Frank was to 
be the conductor. In a businesslike, but very kindly way, he 
said, “Where do you want to get off, old lady?” I replied, “At 
Mrs. K: ’s (Mrs. K. was Frank’s mother,) but I don’t re- 
member just what street she lives on. Could you tell me.” I 
shall never forget how his sensitive little face twitched with 
suppressed emotion, as he hurriedly replied in a low tone, “Yes, 
but she ain’t my mother, is she?’ nor how relieved he looked 
when I replied, “Oh, no, I don’t suppose she ever heard of 
you.” To have been less imaginative than he, not to have 
accepted him as a real conductor, would have been to make a 
small boy momentarily miserable, and to have a mature woman 
conscious of a lack in her own nature. 
Through games and plays children learn the necessity for 
rules regulating them, and usually render willing obedience to 
them. They soon learn that like the laws of the Medes and 
Persians there is no appeal. Many of these games could not 
be traced to their origin, and written rules were never heard 
of in connection with them, perhaps they antedate the games 
originated by Cain and Abel in the Garden of Eden. Tradition, 
however, has preserved them, and one set of children hands   
 
-P-A-G-E-196

them down to the next. The discipline received through play 
in the way of accepting law and order without murmur or com- 
plaint is very valuable. Many times teachers might secure 
willing obedience and unflagging interest in the school room if 
the lesson followed“the plan of some familiar game, and 
through this she might lead up to a fuller appreciation of the 
necessity of law and order in this environment. But here we 
may be on dangerous ground. <A protest may be uttered that 
I would advocate the complete substitution of play for work. 
Dr. Hughes, of Toronto, Canada, has evidently heard this pro- 
test, for he says, “Some teachers even yet think that the ad- 
vocates of play as a valuable means of education mean that 
play should be substituted for work, while others fear that the 
child who has been trained to play will never like to work. Both 
classes are wrong. It was Richter who gave the following 
philosophical answer to such objections: “To teach by play is 
not to spare the child’s exertion or to relieve him of it, but to 
awaken in him a passion which forces on him and renders easy 
the strongest effort.” After quoting Richter, Dr. Hughes 
continues: “Play is the work of childhood. It is the greatest 
agent in co-ordinating the different energies of the brain. It 
develops a tendency to work and cultivate in the energetic 
player the physical force and the characteristic aggressive spirit 
that enjoys work and accomplishes mighty deeds.” Did not 
Wellington say that Waterloo was won on the playgrounds at 
Eton 2 
The idea of play as an important factor in education, and 
that of the whole child, mental, moral and physical, is not 
modern. In Plato’s “Republic” the idea of making work and 
study attractive is suggested as a powerful factor in securing 
good results. All students of the history of education know 
that this doctrine was a part of the plan of Montaigne and 
others. But it was Froebel that made the practical applica- 
tion of the theories in the kindergarten, and it is due to this 
wonderful system that the primary school is now a place of 
happiness and light, while once it was a treadmili—a place of 
dull routine, where warmth and brightness seldom penetrated. 
It is understood that work is the “brain” of the school room; 
no sensible person would argue against that, but while we work 
let us borrow the happiest characteristics from play. Let us 
not rob one of these little ones of his birthright of a joyous, 
happy life in the primary school. It is, after all, only a ques- 
‘ tion of serving or compelling. Shall we develop the child

  DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL AND ManvaL ARTS 197 
along the line of his instincts, or shall we spend our energies in 
forcing him into lines contrary to the laws within him? Often 
compelling seems necessary when it is only seeming. The ac- 
tivity of the child needs only to be drawn away from what is 
merely of no profit, and led into that which is strong, true and 
useful. There is many a difficulty that could be safely and 
easily overcome if play was considered a practical aid, and the 
right play earnestly sought.

a declaration of principles and policy of the department. This 
declaration -was deferred until the next meeting for discussion. 
Supt. J. W. Kuykendall, Fort Smith, Ark., then read a pa- 
per on “Manual Training in High Schools.” After the read- 
ing of this paper, in the discussion which followed, Supt. O. B. 
Gibson of Columbus, Ga., gave an interesting account of the 
work in this direction in the schools of Columbus. 
Prof. W. R. Vickroy of St. Louis, Mo., then read a most 
interesting paper on “Manual Training as a College Require- 
ment,” insisting on shop work being allowed and insisted upon 
as a part of entrance requirements, particularly to technical 
schools, and thus enable the colleges to go much quicker to the

point of teaching their men design of machines and structures, 
and also throwing the time when a boy shall begin to do orig- 
inal designing to an earlier and more formative period in a 
boy’s life. After the discussion of this paper Dr. J. W. John- 
son was elected president, and Robt. H. MeNeilly secretary for 
the next year.

If the question be asked, What makes one person more suc- 
cessful than another, the answer will often be, industry. If 
one community surpasses another in any competitive vocation 
the explanation can usually be found in superior industry. So 
if one nation surpasses its competitors in commerce, manufac- 
turing, science or warfare, a careful investigation will always 
discover that industry and industrial arts.are the fundamental 
causes of superior success. There is much to be praised and 
admired in the esthetics of life, in music, art, rhetoric, philos- 
ophy, ete., and yet when we come to consider what really makes 
a people great, we must ascribe a measure of praise to their 
forms of industry and the output therefrom. It is impossible 
for any people or nation to be truly great without varied and 
successful industries. Is it not, then, the part of common 
sense to introduce industrial features into our school work and
-P-A-G-E-199
  AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT 199 
to maintain it there, from the most elementary school to the 
most advanced in college or university? Wherever these feat- ” 
ures have been introduced they have proved efficient and satis- 
factory, if properly directed. The aims and aspirations of 
this department are to discuss the best methods and times, not 
only for introducing but for maintaining and perfecting, these 
industrial features of school work. We believe that the kin- 
dergarten, though sometimes abused and sometimes misunder- 
stood, yet upon the whole has accomplished much good in train- 
ing hands and feet, eyes and mouth, as well as mind and soul, 
for the realities of life. Learning by doing is the fundamental 
principle, which it seems is able to withstand the criticism of 
enemies and the gibes of scoffers. Froebel, though receiving 
scanty encouragement in Germany among his own people, yet 
was so confident in his theories of education that he ventured 
his prophecy that among the liberal and enthusiastic Ameri- 
cans his principles would finally lead to success. This proph- 
ecy has been many times verified by the successful efforts of 
such great teachers as Miss Elizabeth Peabody of Boston, Mrs. 
Horace Mann, Dr. Henry Barnard and Dr. W. T. Harris, 
whose schools in St. Louis in the seventies were thought to 
come more nearly up to Froebel’s ideas than any other schools 
at the time. 
Kindergarten merges naturally and imperceptilily into man- 
ual training, and develops that dexterity of muscle and brain 
which can so easily be developed and extended when manual 
training is formally entered upon. On the border line between 
the two, both develop a love of nature, power of observation, 
an. inquiry into causes of phenomena, and readiness to take hold 
of causes and investigate them practically. President Elliott, 
of Harvard College, says in regard to manual training: 
“T am old enough to remember when the brain was supposed 
to be the seat of the mind, just as the lungs were held to be 
the furnace that warms the body. I remember being taught 
that the animal heat was kept in the lungs; but we all know 
better now. We know that wherever an atom is consumed, in 
whatever part of the body, there heat is generated, and, there- 
fore, that the animal heat pervades the whole organism. It 
is just so with regard to the human mind; it pervades the 
body. It is not in the head, but it is all over the body; and, 
when you train the hand, or the eye, or the ear, you train the 
mind, As Governor Russell said, manual training is mental 
training. Never admit that manual training is anything dis-
-P-A-G-E-200
  i 200 SourHEeRN EpucaTIoNAL ASSOCIATION 
tinguished from, or in opposition to, mental training. In the 
skill of the artist’s hand, in the methodical, accurate movement 
of the mechanic’s arm, in the acute observation through the 
physician’s eye or ear, there is always mind. Therefore, there 
is no opposition between manual training on the one hand 
and mental training on the other. We are simply training an- 
other kind of faculty—not memory, but discriminating ob- 
servation and correct perception.” 
The trend of public sentiment and considerate judgment, 
now, is that education consists not so much in what we know, 
as how we apply our knowledge to action. We believe, to be 
sure, in liberal education and yet the principle of division of 
labor in educational matters, and efforts econominally applied, 
are subjects worthy of our best thought. We have facts and 
conditions rather than theories to deal with. Hundreds, yea, 
thousands, of boys know and admit that they can attend school 
only tivo or three years after they are ten years of age. How 
can this short time be most advantageously and profitably util- 
ized? I quote from Prof. 8. N. Patton, of the University of 
Pennsylvania: 
“In better economy of what we produce, we have a key to 
our industrial problems; and here, more than anywhere else, 
our practical endeavors can produce results if we work up the 
matter systematically. Give the laborers an education of the 
kind which will have a direct influence upon their consump- 
tion, and the soiution of the other educational problems will 
be much simpler than it now is.” 
While we would not institute invidious comparisons, yet we 
believe success in manual training in the United States com- 
pares favorably with that of any other nation. The “whole 
boy theory,” first advocated and introduced by the great 
pioneer of manual training, Prof. Woodward in St. Louis, in 
1879, has, ever since, been steadily gaining ground. Now it 
scarcely needs the able defense so often given it in the past. 
In regard to the efficiency and superiority of our manual train- 
ing schools no less an authority than our Commissioner of Labor 
Says: 
“There are several incorporated manual training schools in 
the United States which surpass anything of the kind to be 
found abroad. In these, something more is taught than the 
use of mere hand tools. | Machine tools for wood and metal 
work abound, and the colossal mechanical appliances for test- 
ing the strength of materials, ete. (to be seen in the Chicago,
-P-A-G-E-201
AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT 201 
St. Louis, Toledo and Philadelphia schools, dwarf into insignifi- 
cance the relatively meager equipments of the foreign schools 
of this class. In short, Europe has nothing in the nature of 
a manual training school equal to any of these great American 
institutions; nor has the Old World a single institute of tech- 
nology that can bear comparison with the best of our own. In 
our half-developed state colleges of agriculture and the me- 
chanic arts we have the foundation for a better system of tech- 
nical instruction than exists anywhere else today; and in the 
establishment of such noble institutions as the Drexel Institute, 
the Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades, the Armour 
Tnstitute, ete., one may discern the promise of future Ameri- 
can primacy in the industrial arts.” 
Manual training seems to be accepted and approved by the 
thinking public everywhere, but its hindering cause is a want 
of qualified teachers and suitable equipments. It is no sup- 
planter or opponent of physical culture, but rather an ally and 
promoter of every phase of legitimate and healthful athletics. 
Its advocates believe that physical training is more than phys- 
ical development; and, furthermore, than both physical train- 
ing and physical development will follow naturally and neces- 
sarily from properly directed manual training. The manual 
training idea is that the mental, moral and physical nature all 
need coordinate development and training and that a well- 
trained mind and heart, depending upon an undeveloped body, 
is like a great Hercules rowing in an unsafe and untried boat. 
A close ally, and, in fact, an integral part of manual training 
is laboratory work in physics. The necessity and thoroughness 
of this method of instruction becomes more and more pressing 
as engineering instruction is developed, and practically applied. 
Aside from its mental discipline and cultural value, in which it 
abounds copiously, it is fundamental in importance for all stu- 
dents pursuing any kind of engineering courses. Prof. Mas- 
sey, of North Carolina, in discussing manual labor, compulsory 
and paid for, says: 
“Statistics show that in colleges thoroughly equipped for 
their work, and in which the laboratory methods are used, and 
the minor manual operations merely incidental, a much larger 
proportion of the students enter agricultural occupations than 
from the best of those where compulsory and paid manual la- 
bor is the rule.” 
Laboratory methods and all other forms of manual training 
directly lead to technical training, which seems to be one of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
greatest demands in Southern education. Our general govern- 
ment recognized the necessity for that, throughout the whole 
country, when it provided for colleges of agriculture and me- 
chanic arts. Among other things the act states: 
“The leading object shall be * * * to teach such 
branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the me- 
chanic arts in such manner as the legislatures of the states may 
respectively prescribe in order to promote the liberal and prac- 
tical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits 
and professions of life.” 
The demand for the different professions of life seems to be 
fairly well met. Schools of law, theology, medicine, dentistry, 
ete., seem to be well patronized and are furnishing good sup- 
plies for the demand. But, in our Southern country, especially, 
we have great need of leaders and organizers for industrial en- 
terprises; foremen, designers and experts, in special lines of 
industrial practice; also a trained army of skilled craftsmen 
for practical work. | 
As a basis for discussion I offer the following declaration of 
principles and policy for this department: 
1. We believe as a fundamental principle, that in educa- 
tion, the physical, the mental and the moral nature, requires 
coordinate and simultaneous development. 
2. That we recognize the validity of time-honored classical 
instruction, in all its cultural and disciplinary value, and yet 
we believe that along with it, industrial and manual training 
is a pressing need, most especially in the Southern states. 
3. That in the pursuit of the industrial and manual arts 
in high school and college courses, cultural and disciplinary 
values are obtained, not inferior to those of classic and xsthetic 
courses. 
4. That applied science, properly taught in our technical 
schools and wisely used in the economic development of South- 
ern industries and improvements, will most directly and effi- 
ciently lead us to material wealth, sectional prosperity and in- 
tellectual advancement.

MANUAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
J. W. KuykEnpDALL, Superintendent of Schools, Fort Smith, Ark. 
That the idea of giving manual training to every child is 
not new is evidenced by the following from Froebel’s Educa- 
tion of Man, published in 1826: 
“Every child, boy, and youth, whatever his condition and 
position in life, should devote daily at least one or two hours 
to some serious activity in the production of some definite ex- 
ternal piece of work. Lessons through and by work, through 
and from life, are by far the most impressive and intelligible, 
and most continuously and intensely progressive, both in them- 
selves and in their effect on the learner.” 
There is an almost universal recognition of the educational 
value of hand-work, manual training in its broadest sense. 
From the clay modeling and the paper folding of the kinder- 
garten through the laboratory work of the college, manual train- 
ing enters in one form or another into the work of each year 
of the school life. There is no better manual training than the 
penmanship and drawing found in all schools; the map making 
of our geography and history work is manual training; the 
object work in primary numbers, the measurements of arith- 
metic, and the study of geometric forms call into play faculties 
akin to those developed at the work bench. In these forms 
manual training has a fixed place in the lower grades of every 
school of efficiency. Beyond this more general work we find 
no manual training in universal use. The overcrowded con- 
dition of the elementary school program seems to be a barrier 
to the widespread introduction of tool work below the high 
school. 
Beginning with the Russian Exhibit at Philadelphia in 
1876, manual training in its technical sense has been steadily 
making its way in this country, until within the last decade 
manual training schools and manual training departments in 
high schools have become well recognized features of the school 
work of almost every city in the United States. 
“Sacred to the memory of tools might be appropriately in- 
scribed over the entrances to these schools for manual educa- 
tion; for their highest text-books are tuols, and how to use them 
most intelligently is the test of scholarship. To realize the 
potency of tools it is only necessary to contrast the two states 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
204 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of man—the one without tools, the other with tools. See him 
in the first state, naked, shivering with cold, now hiding away 
from the beasts in caves, and now, famished and despairing, 
gaunt and hollow-eyed, creeping stealthily like a panther upon 
his prey. Then see him in the poetic, graphic apostrophe of 
Carlyle. ‘Man,’ he says, ‘is a tool-using animal. He can use 
tools, can devise tools; with these the granite mountains melt 
into the light dust before him; he kneads iron as it were soft 
paste; seas are his smooth highway, winds and fire his un- 
wearying steeds. Nowhere do we find him without tools; 
without tools he is nothing, with tools he is all!’ ”’—Charles H. 
Ham. 
Prof. Woodward, “the father of manual training in this 
country,” says the term manual training “signifies the system- 
atic study of the theory and use of common tools, the nature 
of common materials, elementary and typical processes of con- 
struction, and the execution and reading of drawings. * * * 
The systematic study of tools, processes and materials is the 
essential feature of manual training.” It is this study of tools 
and materials, as well as processes of construction, that differ- 
entiates manual training from the Swedish system of sloyd as 
the latter is commonly understood. However, with character- 
istic disregard for established customs and traditions, the 
American schools have adopted neither the Russian nor the 
Swedish system as a whole, but rather have adapted and Ameri- 
canized both, using the bench and tools of the Russian and in the 
form of work and the completed article following many of 
the Swedish models. Quite a controversy seems to have grown 
up as to whether the pupil shall be permitted to make a com- 
plete and useful article, or be required to confine his work to 
a series of exercises. It is contended on the one hand that, 
with properly selected articles involving specific features, more 
interest may be aroused by permitting the child to finish some 
useful piece of work. On the other hand, it is claimed that, 
in making the completed article, accuracy is sacrificed to ap- 
pearance and that work is accepted that should be rejected. 
But in the “American system” it would seem that the good of 
both ideas is coming to be utilized and their differences are 
being reconciled. Since the object of the instruction at the 
work bench is neither to teach the child to make a perfect dove- 
tailed joint nor to make him a skilful cabinet maker, both 
ideas may well be utilized. The interest may be sustained by
-P-A-G-E-205
Manuva TRAINING IN HicH ScHoois 205 
the making of simple things and accuracy may be secured by 
continued practice upon a part of the process before its in- 
corporation into the finished article. Just as in penmanship 
we are not content to teach the single letters only, but combine 
them into words and sentences, and in arithmetic we do not 
stop with teaching the several processes, but aim at securing 
their perfect mastery in their combinations, so in manual train- 
ing, while each exercise is to be taught for accuracy of work- 
manship, their combination into useful and interesting finished 
products need not be discouraged. 
A Russian, in defending their system, has given a valuable 
epitome of its essential features. He says “Manual training 
must (1) be taught in a thoroughly systematic manner, (2) 
awaken. the interest of the children for physical exercise, (3) 
give certain practical results, (4) develop some amount of 
dexterity of the hands, (5) acccustom the children to order, 
punctuality and cleanliness, (6) correspond to the physical 
and intellectual powers of children, (7) develop the aesthetic 
feeling, (8) serve as recreation for children when they are 
tired by the intellectual work.” 
It is clear that anything that will accomplish, these results 
is entitled to a permanent place in the curriculum of every 
public school that aims at general culture. Such work is an 
integral part of general education and is not in any sense of a 
specific professional character. Superintendent Foos of Read- 
ing, Pa., in the current number of the School Board Journal, 
well says: “The keynote of manual training as now taught 
is culture—mental discipline. Its aim is not to turn out me- 
chanics or specialists in any vocation, nor to produce a finished 
piece of work, but to instill mechanical principles for mental 
development only. Its aim is to bring out all the faculties, to 
encourage the creative rather than the imitative, to lead to 
orderly thinking and logical doing, to express thought in a 
concrete form, to educate the whole man.” 
It is highly important that the proper relation of the manual 
training work to the other courses of the high school be prop- 
erly understood. If it can be placed upon the same footing as 
physics or chemistry, with which, because of the laboratory 
nature of the work, it may be said to be closely related, a 
strong impetus will be given to its growth. This recognition 
in the high school as co-ordinate with other well established 
subjects will do much to remove any false impressions that ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 SovuTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ist as to its nature and purposes. The first impression of the 
public upon the establishment of a manual training depart- 
ment is that it partakes of the nature of the old system of ap- 
prenticeship, and that its one object is to prepare boys for the 
mechanical pursuits. This is resented by those who regard all 
kinds of manual labor as degrading, and who look upon an 
education as opening the way to wealth without work. When 
the reaction comes from this feeling, when the manual train- 
ing work itself has taught that skill of whatever kind is elevat- 
ing, that “the only disgrace attaching to honest labor is the 
disgrace of doing it badly,” there comes a swing of the pendu- 
lum to the other extreme, and the demand is made that the 
manual training course be enlarged to include the teaching of 
the trades—that it be made a veritable trade school. 
In this utter lack of definiteness as to the proper scope of 
manual training, and in this entire misunderstanding of its 
aim and purpose as a part of the scheme of general education, 
lies the greatest menace to its continued success. Permit me 
to quote with emphasis from Miss Ella V. Dobbs, Supervisor 
of Manual Training, Helena, Mont. (National Educational As- 
sociation, 1904.) : 
“Not only are many people not awake to the fact that man- 
ual training exists as a definite part of school work, but a 
vastly greater number have a very meager conception of its 
real meaning or value. One feature or another is emphasized 
in different minds, and it is variously regarded as a recreation 
hour, a sort of faney work, a chance to learn, something prac- 
tical which may mean dollars and cents by and by; a time to 
to make anything great or small suggested by the mama at 
home or the teacher at school, something to be done or left 
undone at the whim of the pupil or parent, or one of the many 
extravagant experiments in which teachers love to indulge at 
the expense of ihe taxpayer. By an ever increasing minority 
it is given its true place as an essential element in education. 
In the solution of this problem the normal school is a potent 
factor, and we should not consider our days of missionary 
work ended until every normal school shall not only require a 
course in manual training, but shall regard it as of the same 
importance as arithmetic or language. If I have described the 
situation correctly, and our weak points are lack of definite 
purpose in our methods and close correlation with other ele- 
ments in education, then our great effort should be to evolve a
-P-A-G-E-207
  MANUAL TRAINING IN Hien ScHooLs 207 
system which shall begin somewhere and end somewhere, and 
stand for something when completed; which shall have some 
vital connection with the rest of school work and with life out- 
side of school.” 
What is the special need of the South for manual training? 
With President Brown Ayres, I ask “Why is a special study 
made of the showing of the South as a section to be judged by 
itself, rather than to include its showing for whatever it is 
worth in that of the whole country?’ And with him, “TI wish 
to say as a Southern man that the South does not wish to have 
established for it a standard in any sense lower than that which 
obtains or is to obtain for the rest of the country.” Jn common 
with the North and the West, the South needs manual training 
in all its high schools, or needs separate manual training high 
schools in its larger cities. But while she needs manual train- 
ing in no greater sense than it is needed elsewhere, yet in com- 
mon with all features of educational development this need is 
being met more slowly. The problem of adequate school reve- 
nues is our ever present, ever pressing, educational problem. 
We of the South feel it daily; it presses upon our every side; 
it makes its impress upon every school room; it represses every 
effort to provide better facilities for our schools; it almost sup- 
presses our fondest hopes for the proper education of our 
children; but the unconquerable spirit of our Southern people 
cannot for long be depressed. Scarcely have we yet recovered 
from our condition of a generation ago sufficiently to have fully 
established our school systems, yet we have our beacon light in 
the educational field, our cities “set upon a hill.” In manual 
training, our agricultural and mechanical colleges have led the 
way, and some of our cities have not been slow to follow. 
In the little city to which I have just been called to take 
charge of the schools, much has already been done and greater 
things are planned. In all our grades, under the direction of 
the regular teachers, we have the manual training work in its 
broader sense, and with a capable supervisor of drawing, with 
models from nature and with water color work, drawing is an 
important element of our course. In both our white and our 
colored high schools the manual training departments are well 
developed, with specially trained teachers in charge. We have 
under construction a manual training building for the colored 
high school, and are preparing to begin the erection of a 
$40,000 annex to our high school, which will have for its lead-

ing features a manual training department and a domestic 
science department. Already our example is being felt, both 
in Arkansas and in the newly developing Indian Territory 
schools. Our sister across the Arkansas river, Van Buren, with 
a population of 4,000 people, through the generosity of one of 
her citizens has just equipped an eflicient manual training de- 
partment. At frequent intervals inquiry is made of us as to 
what equipment is necessary to begin this line of work. 
The past decade has witnessed a wonderful growth of edu- 
cational interest among our people, and no man can predict the 
extent of the development the next few years will bring forth. 
With the constitutional restrictions removed our people will 
cheerfully bear the necessary burden of taxation to place our 
schools upon the highest plane of efficiency. Then will they 
develop in all lines and in all departments. 
Our sons will build the bridges and bore the tunnels that 
will awaken the hum of industry upon our hillsides, and pour 
the teeming numbers into our valleys, while our daughters will 
preside at the fireside and at the festal board with the grace 
that has made the old South famed in song and story. 
MANUAL TRAINING AS A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT. 
Pror. W. R. Vickroy, Manual Training School, St. Louis, Mo. 
Some twenty-five years ago the founders of manual training 
began to devise methods for giving instruction in the mechanic 
arts. Their efforts appeared revolutionary to many educators, 
because two new subjects, mechanical drawing and the use of 
tools, were added to the studies in the established high school 
courses, and a few culture studies, really of college rank, omit- 
ted; appeared to be radical, when the only change was a change 
in emphasis due to a careful co-ordinating of these new sub- 
jects with the old. Their whole strength was put upon the 
work of the secondary schools. However, while instruction in 
these new subjects did not depart very much from the methods 
which had received the sanction of centuries, certainly not as 
much as our present laboratory methods in science, it did give a 
decided character to the schools which introduced them. 
In the ferment which has followed, the kind and the amount
-P-A-G-E-209
(MANUAL TRAINING AS A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT 209 
of work to be done in these new subjects and its proper co- 
ordination with the parallel academic work has been largely 
decided by the local needs of each community and the special 
point of view of those who have had its accomplishment in 
charge. In consequence, there is at present some confusion as 
to what manual training really is. In default of some central 
authority to prescribe the true intent and limits of the term 
in regard to the secondary schools, it will be the object of 
this paper to canvas the situation, to attempt to formulate the 
essentials of these two new subjects, and to suggest, as a result 
of my experience, the credit they should have in the summing 
up of the preparatory work. 
What is this so-called manual training? The term does not 
satisfactorily expain itself. It was used by the founders of the 
movement for want of a more appropriate descriptive phrase, 
and given a special meaning. Manual training is not manual 
labor, nor is it an extension of the kindergarten. It is not 
“busy work” to employ the idle minds and hands of those who 
excel their fellows in quickness of apprehension or aptness in 
manual execution. It is not an occupation in which time and 
money and energy are lavished to make a few show pieces as 
mementoes of a sometime skill. It is not the training of a 
trade school. It is not sloyd, or work where the utility of the 
accomplished exercise is of more importance than the making 
of it. It is not practice with any tool until a commercial pro- 
ficiency has been attained. It is not an excuse for an applica- 
tion of the fine arts. It is not the irregular and optional work 
done in a shop attached to a high school. It is certainly not 
the work of a reformatory or of a school for unfortunates. 
Manual training is an attempt to put the whole boy to 
school. It gives academic instruction while it gives the ele- 
ments of the mechanic arts in such a way as to leave an under- 
standing of tools and materials rather than special skill. It 
seeks to develop power and insight through the comprehension 
of fundamental processes rather than create exquisitely finished 
products. The field it has to cover is so vast that it is forced 
to choose the fundamental and the essential rather than the 
useful and the beautiful, if there is a necessity for choice. It 
is intensive, economical of needless repetition, and ever watch- 
ful to give a maximum of insight in a minimum of time and 
with a minimum of effort. 
Manual training is not of sporadic origin, seeking to fasten 
itself upon the present school system. It was called into being
-P-A-G-E-210
210 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
by the needs of the engineering students, and has been shifted 
back to a pre-university or preparatory period not only to gain 
the much-needed time for other studies, but also to lay a more 
solid foundation for the mechanical conceptions of future en- 
gineers. Della-Vos in the University of St. Petersburg, Dr. 
Runkle in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Pro- 
fessor Woodward in the School of Engineering and Architec- 
ture of Washington University, all saw clearly that while an 
engineer in discussion might represent the thrusts and stresses 
ofa machine by simple straight lines, in erecting that same ma- 
chine he would have to give the parts suitable mass and frame 
them together according to the ripe experience of generations 
of artisans; that an engineer must have almost an instructive 
faculty for mass, strength and the details of suitable form. 
It, therefore, seems strange to me to see so many zealous 
friends of manual training in the secondary schools lose sight 
of its origin and purpose, and seek to co-ordinate it with the 
kindergarten or the ordinary forms of industrial art, however 
meritorious they may be. 
Though manual training is of inestimable value to the manu- 
facturer and the contractor, to my mind its highest utility is in 
giving the school-bred engineer a mastery of materials and 
the simple methods of construction. And it seems to me that 
because so many technical schools maintain their own shops, 
originally of necessity, at present through foree of tradition, 
or on account of the lack of uniformity in the training offered 
by the preparatory schools—the universities have not been 
sufficiently interested in directing the spread of this manual 
training movement. It is now high time for them to relieve 
themselves of the maintenance of shops for the teaching of the 
fundamentals of the crafts, and devote their financial strength 
and their valuable time to much-needed lines of investigation 
and design. And it seems to me that the best way for them 
to do so, or at least prepare to do so, is for them to agree upon 
the essentials of manual training and then demand a fair knowl- 
edge of these essentials from their candidates for admission. 
In a way many of the universities even now recognize the 
manual training work of our secondary schools by giving full 
credit for that work in the engineering courses, thus giving the 
student that much leisure. While such a state of affairs is not 
satisfactory, the manual-bred boy getting no more than his 
classical fellow, I fear that it will continue until the instrue- 
tion in drawing and shop work shall become as common, uni-
-P-A-G-E-211
(MANUAL TRAINING AS A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT 211 
form and thorough as instruction in sub-freshman mathematics. 
And such universality for manual training is inevitable: 
1. The community demands that such training be put upon 
a sub-freshman basis, because it is valuable to the business man 
as well as the trained engineer. 
2. The universities with all the demand made upon them 
for instruction in so many branches of special investigation will, 
or should, be glad to shift the instruction. of all elementary 
branches to the preparatory schools. 
3. Skill and effective mastery are growths which can not be 
imposed or hastily acquired. While the university man can 
comprehend the elements of the mechanic’s arts in a few les- 
sons, such knowledge does not become part and parcel of him; 
it is something he will have to recall rather than something 
which is suggested by the needs of the moment.. The younger 
man acquires the skill and the habits of thought more readily 
and can give himself up more fully to their mastery. 
4. A mastery of the alphabet of construction is needed as 
a foundation for all engineering studies. It is only by actual 
experience with materials and processes of construction that 
the mind instinctively grasps the lessons of form, the relations 
of size and strength, and that true beauty does not consist in or- 
nament, but in a skilful adaptation of means to ends. Design 
without such a sub-structure of experience with materials and 
processes is too often the making of pretty, petty and impossi- 
ble pictures, which no intelligent workman can look at without 
smiling. 
When the universities can come to this, they can erect upon 
a solid foundation of skilful handicraft a generous superstruc- 
ture of free design and experimental construction. 
Perhaps the best way to arrive at what is really essential is 
to enumerate some typical processes which might be asked for 
in an entrance examination. Requirements for admission to 
colleges and technical schools can be roughly divided into two 
classes—those that make for intellectual development and are 
complete in themselves, and those that also form the founda- 
tion for future work. If shop work and drawing were offered 
for admission to college, they would certainly have to be con- 
sidered as humanities and the equivalents of some of the elect- 
ives and should not receive too much credit. A certificate 
from a reputable manual training school that the candidate 
has completed four years of shop work might be counted one 
unit, and be considered the equivalent of a year’s work in phys- 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
212 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ies, experimental and otherwise; the ability to handle ortho- 
- graphic projections with ease might be rated as the equivalent 
of analyzing a play of Shakespeare—it certainly requires as 
much imagination as to unravel a plot; the skilful finding of 
shades and shadows, the equivalent of a close study. of one of 
Milton’s shorter poems; while a good knowledge of the ele- 
ments of artistic design or decoration could be counted half a 
unit, and the equivalent of a half-year’s work in history. 
When it comes to requirement for admission to a technical 
_ school, the applicant should know the subjects which articulate 
with the courses offered by the university applied to. These 
subjects should be as carefully described in the conditions of 
admission as any academic requirement; should be as carefully 
tested, and should receive greater credit than for the college; 
for, allow me to repeat, a thorough knowledge of materials and 
modes of construction is a sine qua non of all good engineer- 
ing. In carpentry the applicant must be able to grind and 
whet an edge tool properly and easily, lay off some joint from a 
blue print in an acceptable manner, execute with reasonable 
accuracy and dispatch and with the proper tools a given exer- 
cise, and design a workmanlike detail for a specified box or 
rack. He should receive for a passable proficiency in this a 
eredit of one half a unit. In pattern-making test his knowl- 
edge of the use of patterns in molding, and his ability to con- 
struct a pattern which involves some simple turning and carv- 
ing. This would be looked over for simplicity of method and 
for accuracy, and receive, if satisfactory, one half a unit. In 
the smithy he should weld a link of given dimensions, forge a 
steel tool and design and make a forged fitting for a specified 
purpose; the proper procedure, care and skill receiving half a 
unit. In the machine shop he should be able to set up work in 
the different machines, design a cutter for a specified purpose, 
and describe the steps and tools to be used for any given proc- 
ess; he should be tried in the use of ordinary hand tools and 
of all the automatic machines which require nice adjustment 
and great precision, for all of which-he should receive half a 
unit. 
Drawing is the special language of the artisan and the en- 
gineer. In this the candidate should show a fair proficiency, 
being well acquainted with the ordinary draughting devices 
and methods of construction, being able to read drawings read- 
ily and accurately, and showing an ability to put upon paper as 
dimension sketches or as more finished working drawings any
-P-A-G-E-213
  MANUAL TRAINING AS A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT 213 
simple machine which may be assigned. He should also be 
able to pick out the essentials of any simple structure accu- 
rately from memory and fill in the uncharacteristic detail from 
theory. He should show that he can mentally reproduce the 
object in space, and see it distinctly. For this he should re- 
ceive one unit. 
I do not see how any engineering school which requires 
fifteen units for admission can lessen that amount with justice 
to its product. I would therefore favor adding at least three 
additional units to the requirements. In the transitional stage 
I would condition the candidates who could not pass muster. 
Then the shop and drawing could be adjusted as at present. 
There would be a decided change, however, for the courses in 
design and construction could begin earlier than they now do, 
with advantage to all concerned. The needs of modern en- 
gineering are crowding the courses of our technical schools to 
such an extent that the student body must gets its mechanical 
skill and insight before it begins its professional studies; that 
is, if the instruction is to keep abreast of the times. 
There is but one great difficulty in accomplishing all this, and 
that is the scarcity of fully trained teachers. In no subject is 
there a smaller supply, and in no subject is there more de- 
manded. The manual training teacher must have the training 
and skill of a mechanic; a cleverness of construction just short 
of that of the engineer; and the tact, ability and generous en- 
thusiasm of a teacher. The man who does only what is pre- 
scribed, and that in a perfunctory manner, who shuts up his 
shop and its problems at the close of the recitation, who feels 
above his vocation or that he is a pariah in an intellectual com- 
munity, is not the man to impart life and spirit to the impor- 
tant matter intrusted to his keeping. Where are we to get 
the right kind of men? So far as I know there has been no 
very serious effort made to train them for this profession. 
Much seems to depend upon the skill in reading character of 
those that are called upon to fill such places. They do well, 
but how much is lost with every change. There is a great de- 
mand for such teachers; it is so great and the supply so small 
that many a community is forced to be content with the services 
of a half trained boy, who has had no preparation to teach, and 
who suddenly decides to do so when the call comes to him. 
I have no fears about the virility or the vitality of manual 
training. Its hold upon actual life is so great that it will sur- 
vive even under trifling and spiritless conditions. I have great  
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ener 
hopes for its future. I know of at least one institution where a 
serious effort is being made to gather together a group of young 
men who have had at least a high school training or of young 
mechanics whose efforts at self-improvement have given them 
presence and purpose and balance, to train them in the actual 
exercises of the shop and drawing room, to cultivate a spirit of 
inquiry and experiment, and to give them some instruction in 
the principles of pedagogy. I feel sure that the good results 
of the work done by such a body of men will be beyond cavil, 
will magnify their office and make it honorable and necessary 
in the eyes of all men. 
In conclusion allow me to reiterate my points, and commend 
them to your calm consideration: 
1. Manual training is chiefly concerned with a boy’s mental 
development. 
2. Manual training proceeded from the technical school, 
and was shifted back to a more receptive and less occupied por- 
tion of school life. 
3. Manual training with its strong touch upon real life is 
needed as a preparation for colleges, and especially as a prepara- 
tion for a technical school. 
4. Manual training needs a well formulated and generally 
accepted body of doctrine, at least in regard to the essentials 
and purpose. 
5. Manual training must have a body of instructors who 
can appreciate fully its bearing upon the making of the future 
man. 
MECHANIC ARTS AT THE AGRICULTURAL AND 
MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 
Pror. A. M. Hercer, Louisiana Agricultural and Mechanical College. 
For a number of years it has been my privilege to have been 
engaged in giving instruction in the mechanic arts at agricul- 
tural and mechanical colleges, and it is with pleasure, there- 
fore, that I appear before you on this occasion to give a short 
address on this subject,.which is of such great importance to 
all sections of this country, but especially to the South. 
As you are perhaps all aware the agricultural and mechanical 
colleges were created by the Morrill bill, which was passed 
by Congress in 1862. On account of the war and the unsettled
-P-A-G-E-215
MECHANIC ARTS AT THE AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES 215 
condition of affairs in the years immediately following, it was 
some time before the Southern States availed themselves of 
the privileges of this act. In 1888 additional funds were 
granted to each of the agricultural and mechanical colleges by 
the passage of the Hatch bill. The Morrill bill specifically 
provides .that instruction must be given in agriculture and in 
the mechanic arts and such other allied subjects as are neces- 
sary to their development. It was with keen foresight that the 
framer of this bill linked agriculture and the mechanic arts. 
They should go hand in hand. They are complements of each 
other. Agriculture provides the raw material, mechanic arts 
the finished product. 
The construction and development of agricultural imple- 
ments has been as large a factor in increasing our wealth as 
has resulted from the study of the best crops to be planted and 
the best methods of culture. Without the cotton gin the 
largest agricultural crop that the South produces would never 
have attained the importance that it oceupies today; arfd if 
only one half of the cotton were converted into cloth before it 
left our borders instead of the $500,000,000 which the crop 
brings today it would easily be double this amount. The im- 
portance of agriculture is self-evident, but it is also of great im- 
portance that the implements used in the cultivation of the 
crops that we grow should be made here, for if this were done 
we would get “the profit from both the agricultural product 
and the Pera article. There is no reason why we 
should, as we do in many instances, supply the iron and wood 
that are used in building machinery, and buy the finished prod- 
uct from another section of this country. I have often thought 
that it is rather a misfortune for the soil of a country to be 
too rich, for it was the barrenness of the soil of New England 
that forced her to go into manufacturing, and it is manufac- 
turing that has given her the power that she wields today. 
New England raises as much on her barren soil as it is possible 
for her to do, and if she could raise the cotton that her factories 
consume she would do so, and this would be ideal from her 
standpoint. This is our position, and we can do both, and al- 
though it takes some time to develop the skill necessary to pro- 
duce a manufactured article it has been successfully done in 
some sections of the South, and there is not one of our states 
that should not have its quota of cotton mills. What is true of 
the cotton industry is true also of the lumber industry. Mem- 
phis is the hardwood market of the United States, and most of       
    
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 SourneRN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
our states have an almost unlimited quantity of wood of all 
kinds, and instead of converting these woods into finished prod- 
ucts, in many cases they are sold in the standing tree, are cut 
and shipped to other sections of our union, where they are con- 
verted into furniture of all kinds and are then sent back to us. 
Now the profit on a manufactured article is always greater 
than the profit on the raw material, and the higher the grade 
of article made the greater the percentage of profit, so that it is 
easy to see that so long as we remain the producers of raw ma- 
terials only and send them away to be converted into products 
ready for use, just so long will we fail to attain the position 
that our natural resources indicate. 
The principal reason that more manufacturing is not done in 
the South is because we lack the technical knowledge and the 
skill that is necessary for success. To emphasize this state- 
ment I call your attention to a part of State Superintendent 
Whitfield’s report to the last general assembly of Mississippi, 
quoted in Dr. Johnson’s admirable address to the last Missis- 
sippi State Teachers’ Association. Says Mr. Whitfield: “In 
response to an invitation of the commission who had the build- 
ing of the Mississippi state house in charge a number of plans 
were submitted by architects of almost every section of the 
country, but no Mississippi architect entered the contest, and 
the magnificent fee, as well as the honor, went to a citizen of 
St. Louis. When the contract was let, there was no bidder 
from Mississippi, and the profit was carried to Chicago. Prac- 
tically every skilled workman, those who received the largest 
wages, was imported. The artists who contributed so much to 
the building in the way of beautiful decorations were not of 
our people. Mississippi carried the mortar and the brick and 
in the main received day laborer’s wages, which meant only a 
living to those engaged in the work. If Mississippi had been 
forced to construct the capitol with her own skill the beautiful 
building we now have would have been impossible.” Instances 
of a similar state of affairs are familiar to every one present. 
To remedy this condition we must as rapidly as possible de- 
velop our courses in the mechanic arts at our agricultural and 
mechanical colleges and introduce manual training in all of 
our public schools. The object of teaching the mechanic arts 
in the agricultural and mechanical colleges is to give a general 
training in the construction and uses of the typical tools used 
in manufacturing and in building operations as far as it is pos- 
sible to do in a school. The student may study the mechanic
-P-A-G-E-217
  MECHANIC ARTS AT THE AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES 217 
arts with the object of becoming an architect, contractor, sugar 
house manager, manufacturer, or with the object of becoming 
a professional mechanical, electrical or mining engineer, for 
each of these callings requires a knowledge of the mechanic 
arts for their successful prosecution. 
The subjects usually taught in the mechanic arts courses at 
the agricultural and mechanical colleges are joinery, wood- 
turning, pattern making, foundry work, forging and machine 
shop work in the order given. 
The course in joinery teaches the student the names and 
uses of the various tools used in working wood and the names 
and construction of the numerous joints and fastenings that are 
used in making finished products. The uses of these principles 
of joinery in pattern making, cabinet making and house build- 
ing are pointed out. The wood turning course gives instruc- 
tion in the operation and uses of the lathe and turning tools and 
the exercises given include all the principles of wood turning, 
namely, center turning, face plate turning and chucking. The 
joinery and turning are usually finished in the freshman year 
and for a good course ten to twelve hours a week are necessary. 
After these subjects have been completed pattern making 
and foundry work are taken up. In making patterns for cast- 
ings the student learns the application of both joinery and 
wood turning to one very important line of wood work. He 
makes patterns for both plain and cored castings, and it is well 
if the pattern making and foundry work are taken together, so 
that after a pattern has been. made the student goes at once to 
the foundry to make the mold and casting, for only in this way 
ean he fully understand the necessity for making the pattern 
so that it can be drawn from the sand in making the mold; 
patterns should be made sufficiently large to allow for shrinkage 
in cooling and provide an additional amount of metal if the 
casting is to be finished in the machine shop. 
In the foundry the student learns how to handle the cupola, 
brass furnace and core oven, the mixing of metals to give re- 
quired results, the proportion of coal and iron or brass, or 
whatever the metal may be, to give the metal the proper fluid- 
ity; he learns how to make the iron hard or soft and to handle 
the many tools that are used in making castings. The pattern 
making and foundry work are usually done in the sophomore 
year and should be allowed six hours a week. 
Forging is the shop work of the junior year and should be 
given six hours a week. In the forge shop the student learns
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  218 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
how to manage the fire, which is one of his most difficult tasks ; 
he learns how to use the different hand tools, the power ham- 
mer, and how to draw down, bend, form, twist, split, punch and 
weld iron and steel; he learns how to case-harden iron and 
how to temper and anneal steel. The year’s work is usually 
completed by making a set of tools for use in the machine shop. 
In the senior year the student usually spends six hours a 
week in the machine shop. He learns how to use the lathe, 
shaper, planer, drill press, milling machine, grinder, cold 
chisel, hammer and file, and a large variety of hand tools and 
instruments that are used in working the metals. He learns 
how to turn and finish straight and taper work, to bore straight 
and taper holes, to cut threads, to plane and scrape true sur- 
faces, to drill holes accurately, to cut gear wheels and to do 
accurate grinding work. The student also learns the speeds at 
which cast iron, brass end steel can be removed with a tool so 
as not to draw the temper of the tool, and he learns the proper 
lubricants and tools to be used on the different metals. 
From the brief outline that I have given of the work done 
in the mechanic arts at the agricultural and mechanical colleges 
it is readily understood that a great variety of work is done 
and that the student becomes familiar with the typical tools 
used in working wood and the various metals used in manufac- 
turing. Moreover, he learns by actual experience, is taught 
to think for himself and is encouraged to do as much experi- 
menting as his time permits. 
It is with plesaure that I call your attention to the fact that 
daily many new manufacturing industries are coming into ex- 
istence in the South, and while they may not all be projected 
by our own people, after a while we will own and operate them, 
and to this end the agricultural and mechanical colleges were 
created. Let each of us give as much encouragement in this 
direction as possible. 
We are doing this in Louisiana. Under the able and efficient 
administration of Dr. Thos. D. Boyd, President of the Louisi- 
ana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 
the development of the course in mechanic arts has been given 
a wonderful stimulus. Within the past four years we have 
erected a two-story brick building, 80 feet by 200 feet, which 
cost $30,000, and we have a complete set of shops with an 
equipment that cost about $12,000. During the past session 
ninety-four students received instruction in the shops and de- 
spite the yellow fever scare we have ninety students receiving

instruction in the shops during the present session. In view 
of its importance to the South let us do all we can to increase 
the efficiency of the instruction in the mechanic arts at our 
agricultural and mechanical colleges. 
PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN PHYSICAL 
GEOGRAPHY. 
C. Louise Fratey, Nashville High Schools. 
Ever since the Committee of Ten, appointed by the N. E. A. 
placed such emphasis on field and laboratory work in Physical 
Geography many schools have tried to solve the very difficult 
problems involved in this type of school work. 
Probably one of the greatest difficulties in the way of teach- 
ing this study according to modern methods, is the inherited 
idea that the purpose of geography is “to describe” or “to give 
information” concerning the earth. This is one of its functions, 
but by no means the greatest. 
Physical Geography is just as much a science as physics or 
chemistry or any of the natural sciences. If the teacher of 
physics or chemistry were asked to teach these subjects without 
laboratory equipment, he would refuse to do so; he would tell 
you that much knowledge, broad: and valuable to a certain 
extent, could be acquired by study of a textbook and recitations 
thereon, but the well disciplined mind, and scientific habits of 
study resulting from systematic exercises requiring first hand 
investigation, would not so generally result. 
No well designed modern school denies to biology, physics 
or chemistry, proper laboratory equipment, or favorable ar- 
rangement of program for adequate treatment, but Physical 
Geography still stands at the door and knocks. The indiffer- 
ence of school authorities in many cases, who fail to recognize 
the value of such work, is another drawback, for it is to them 
that the Physical Geography teacher must turn for the required 
amount of space, the necessary apparatus and a convenient ar- 
rangement of program—or should I say a disarrangement ? 
Perhaps it is because the “new geography” is still a little 
too new, and the number of teachers whose training has been 
sufficiently special and broad still too few. There has not yet 
been time enough for all schools to adapt themselves to changed

conditions, even though the need of laboratory work is gen- 
erally recognized. We are but meeting what other sciences have 
experienced and overcome. | 
The discussion of practical exercises can be but brief within 
the limits of this paper. Perhaps an outline of a proper 
equipment for efficient work might not be out of place; then 
exercises that have been successfully tried, and such as are 
not dependent upon extensive equipment may cover the ground 
intended for this paper. A standard or uniform equipment 
of apparatus for geographical teaching has not yet been fixed up- 
on, but as far back as 1898 Wm. Morris Davis gave what he con- 
sidered a fair arrangement of a classroom and apparatus de- 
signed to accommodate about forty pupils during lectures or 
recitations and eighteen at tables for laboratory work. All 
teachers planning a room for physiography teaching will find 
this article exceedingly helpful; it may be found in the Journal 
of School Geography, for May, 1898, Vol. II, No. 5. 
In the Bulletin of the American Bureau of Geography (now 
merged with Journal of Geography), Vol. I, No. 1, is also an 
excellent description of a good working laboratory, by Henry 
B. Kimmel. Indeed, so many fine suggestions are to be had 
from the Journal of Geography that it in itself is one of the 
iost valuable aids to the teacher; its pages contain the 
freshest and most practical thought on this important topic. 
Sinee I cannot offer for your inspection anything approach- 
ing an adequately furnished room, I must refer to the above 
mentioned articles, if you desire practical assistance in this di- 
rection. The limited space afforded by our present High 
School building and the consequent over-crowding of classes 
make any improvement in this line almost impossible for the 
present. 
Tarr’s New Physical Geography contains excellent matter in 
the appendixes for exercises and apparatus that a school could 
follow with profit. Mr. Davis also suggests several good ideas 
as to arrangement of room in his Teachers’ Guide, to accom- 
pany his elementary book. 
A well lighted, good sized room is required, even though 
everything should be compactly arranged. Tables are better 
than desks, since the latter are too small for the maps, models, 
ete., with which the pupils will often work. These must be 
large enough to give each pupil sufficient elbow-room. When 
a class numbers over 24, the difficulties arising often 
check successful work. In some schools two rooms are given
-P-A-G-E-221
  PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 221 
up to Physical Geography, one for a lecture or recitation room 
where 40 may comfortably recite at a period, the other fitted 
as noted above. 
As a stereopticon and slides now form a prominent part of 
the essential apparatus, the windows should be fitted with 
opaque shades for darkening the room when the lantern is 
used. A screen on a spring roller is the best for showing the 
pictures, as the same space can be utilized to hold wall maps 
at other times. 
Suitable cases are needed for holding maps, slides, photo- 
graphs, rock and mineral specimens, and small models. Wall 
maps on spring rollers are also desirable. A tightly stretched 
wire fastened along the wall to which maps and pictures may 
be hung with hooks or clothes pins, is often found convenient 
and cheap. 
A small weather shelter (U. S. pattern) with a few meteor- 
ological instruments, such as a maximum and a minimum ther- 
mometer, wet and dry bulb thermometers, a barometer and a 
rain guage, and a weather-vane on some neigivoring roof, is 
a fairly good outfit for some interesting work in connection 
with study of atmosphere. 
A good, large globe that shows the earth’s position at differ- 
ent seasons is absolutely essential, and enough small ones to 
permit one to each two pupils. The topographical map sheets 
published by the United States Geological Survey are indis- 
pensible and a little pamphlet entitled “Governmental Maps 
for Use in Schools,” (Holt, New York, 35 cents), is a good 
guide. 
In a manual by Trafton called “Laboratory and Field Ex- 
ercixes ip Physical Geography” (Ginn & ©o.) and in another 
by Brigham (Appleton) are a sufficient number of exercises 
on topographic maps to enable a teacher to become quite an 
expert at handling these maps; if some such manual could be 
placed in the hands of our pupils much valuable time could be 
saved. If topographic maps are backed with cloth, they may 
be more easily handled and will last longer. They cost $2.00 
per hundred. A small reference library of about 50 books for 
intensive individual study on assigned topics is also essential. 
The usual 45-minute recitation period is not long enough 
for proper laboratory exercises. This should be a double pe- 
riod and each school must work out its own program to permit 
this. 
Both laboratory and field lessons should be so arranged as to 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
fit the topics under discussion in the text-book wherever it is 
possible. 
T confess I have never solved the problem of field excursions 
to my satisfaction. Often I have had six classes daily, num- 
bering 35 to 40 and more pupils each. This would require 
more afternoons and Saturdays than one teacher could phys- 
ically endure. The field excursion will be more inviting to 
the high school teacher and student, when elementary field 
trips shall be more generally a part of the grammar school 
work throughout the geography course. Geography is too 
often neglected in the grades; in many cases the child “fin- 
ishes” this difficult world study at the age of twelve, the time 
when he is just beginning to be able to think. While much 
of the old memoriter learning has been relegated to the past, 
scientific learning has not yet taken its place. The sad truth 
which lies at the root of the whole trouble is that too few nor- 
mal schools have properly trained their students in the past 
to really teach geography; but progress is being made and 
there is ground for hope that this step-sister of the curriculum 
will soon come into possession of her just rights. 
Geography is now being seriously treated in our greatest 
universities, and such men as Wm. Morris Davis, Ralph S. 
Tarr, and Rollin Salisbury hold chairs in this department in 
three of our greatest institutions. Now all this means that the 
present state of physical geography as a laboratory study in the 
high school is hesitating and uncertain. The number of ex- 
ercises in physiography is very large and the time permitted 
by our school programs so limited that teachers must select 
carefully those which have greatest value and wherever it is 
possible minimize the merely mechanical, such as drawing 
maps, by using the excellent outline maps now published. 
There should be no place for mere devices that serve only to 
keep pupils busy. 
Physical Geography is usually treated under four heads: 1. 
The Earth as'‘a Globe. 2. The Lands. 3. The Atmosphere. 
4. The Ocean. Some physiographers offer a fifth division in 
a study of Life, but it is as well never to separate this from the 
four main topies, but to show the influence on life activities 
wherever it is applicable. 
Under the first topic, the position, size, shape and move- 
ments of the earth as a member of the solar system and all the 
consequences as seasons, day and night, facts of latitude and  
-P-A-G-E-223
  PRACTICAL HXERCISES IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 223 
longitude, are discussed. Usually this division of the study 
is a favorite with neither teacher nor student, and is often dis- 
missed with the recitation of set definitions and statements. If 
taught by means of experiments and problems to ‘be solved, it 
will not only be more educative, but will become very de- 
lightful. 
Following are some exercises in connection with this topic: 
1. Construct diagrams showing relative positions of planets 
and sun. 
2. Diagram showing relative size of sun, earth and moon 
(this from given data). 
3. Diagram showing position of earth at different seasons; 
also showing distribution of light (this from demonstration 
with globe). 
4, Demonstration of the rotation of the earth. Suspend an 
iron ball by a fine wire to the ceiling where a space of about 
25 feet can be obtained (in the hall, where a stairway turns, is 
a good place). Draw a chalk line on the floor in the plane in 
which the pendulum is to swing. Make a loop of string, pass 
it around the ball and fasten it back. Burn the string through 
with a match. Have the pupils watch the vibratiton of the 
pendulum and record all observations; this simple illustration 
of the Foucicault pendulum is easily carried out, and a full 
explanation of the experiment is given in Trafton’s Laboratory 
Exercises (Ginn & Oo.) . 
One of the most difficult things for the young student to grasp 
is the inclination of the axis and the revolution of the earth 
around the sun and all the consequences; with skill the teacher 
can demonstrate these as well as the varying length of day and 
night in such a way that they will be truly understood; a globe 
showing inclination and revolution is desirable, but an ordinary 
one can serve with a little ingenuity on the part of the teacher. 
After this has been grasped by the pupil such problems as follows 
can be offered for solution: If the axis of the earth were in- 
clined 10° instead of 233° what would be the width of the 
zones? How would the length of day and night be affected ? 
Suppose the inclination to be 35° or 45° what would be the 
consequences ¢ 
The determination of latitude by the altitude of the pole 
star is another exercise that is practical and helpful. Ask 
such questions as Where must you be to see the sun in the 
zenith on March 22% How would it appear to an observer at 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the north pole on the same day? Suppose you were at Cape 
Nome, Alaska, on Christmas day, where would you see the sun ? 
To an observer at the equator where is it on June 21? Ete. 
Where and when do tourists see the midnight sun at Scan- 
dinavia? The problems like this are almost endless and un- 
doubtedly result in mental gain. 
The most attractive laboratory work is a study of common 
rocks and minerals. I have never yet found a class of pupils 
who did not pursue this with enthusiasm. Even the dullest 
boy will wake up when you give him a piece of granite and a 
magnifying lense to search for the minerals which compose the 
rock. The Washington School Collections No. 2 and No. 3, 
put up by E. E. Howell, Washington, D. C., cost but $4. 
These are good guides with which to compare your collection 
as it is made. A few magnifying lenses, some squares of glass, 
a couple of streak plates, the minerals showing scale of hard- 
ness, and a small bottle of hydrochloric acid will give a sufficient 
outfit for determination of the commoner rocks. It is astonish- 
ing how large a collection the pupils will soon gather; some 
localities abound in a great variety of rocks; in others there 
are but few, or even none; but in nearly every household 
travelers have brought home corals from Florida, crystals from 
Hot Springs, ores from the west, and an obliging druggist will 
frequently contribute his mite toward the cabinet; while a 
maker of monuments is found in nearly every community ‘and 
will allow the children to gather marble and granite chips by 
the dozen. The collection should be carefully arranged, la- 
beled and catalogued. The importance of these in the business 
world is easily evident, and lends a practical value to such 
study. In many schools the study of minerals is carried on 
throughout the year, a distinct period each week being set 
aside for the purpose. 
But it is perhaps from the study of the Ui nodicne that I 
get most satisfactory results under existing conditions. Daily 
observations of weather conditions are made by the pupils and 
recorded in a note book arranged for that purpose. These 
consist of records of barometric pressure, of maximum and 
minimum thermometers, dry and wet bulb thermometers, wind 
direction and approximate velocity, conditions of sky, clouds, 
amount of precipitation, calculation of dew point and relative 
humidity from tables. These are carefully summarized each 
month. The daily weather map is studied. The daily tem- 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 225 
perature curve is plotted. From a study of maps for success- 
ive days the paths of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic areas are chart- 
ed. Isobaric and isothermal charts are made and finally a 
complete weather map is constructed from furnished data. If 
we had some quick, cheap way of indicating the pressures and 
temperatures on blank maps and giving them to pupils in that 
shape, it would aid greatly. As it is the mechanical dictating 
and entering these consume much valuable time. 
In studying cyclonic disturbances, instead of stating the 
direction of winds in these eddies let the pupils discover it; 
place a piece of tracing paper over the area on the weather 
map, and copy the arrows in the region within five hundred 
miles of the center. Place this same piece of paper over sev- 
eral such “lows” anid the result will be a composite diagram of 
winds, indicating the spiral inward movement. Do the same 
for the anti-cyclones. Blank weather maps are furnished by 
the local weather bureau, and we often get excellent matter 
from the main office at Washington. In connection with these 
exercises the pupils prepare short papers upon the United 
States Weather Bureau, and the practical importance of its 
work to every line of business. Later the students pay a visit 
to the local weather bureau and observe the actual process of 
forecasting. 
The isothermal and isobaric maps in most text books show- 
ing distribution of temperatures and pressures for January and 
for July form the basis for a great many exercises of great 
value. 
Diagrams showing the migrations of the thermal equator 
can be made by pupils; then all the results should be indicated 
and explained. Detailed study of annual rainfall maps de- 
velops many interesting problems; in connection with chart 
showing wind belt, deserts and other phenomena can be ac- 
counted for. 
It is not possible in such a limited paper as this to do more 
than suggest material and methods of dealing with it. Ex- 
amination of such charts should clearly show relationships from 
which pupils can formulate laws. 
I get very much discouraged when I think of the large num- 
ber of valuable laboratory lessons that can be had on the 
topics devoted to lands, and know how little time we have for 
the same. The only solution is either to extend the time for 
physical geography or to eliminate some of the topics now 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
226 SourHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
usually taught. The laboratory manuals now being issued 
give excellent practice on the interpretation of the topographic 
maps which constitute a large part of the work under this di- 
vision; notably, the one by Brigham (Appleton’s) and the one 
by Trafton (Ginn). 
The lantern and slides furnish invaluable aid. No school 
can afford to do without it. The excursions for the purpose of 
studying local examples of land forms, soil formation, and 
stream action cannot be omitted from a réally valuable course ; 
yet herein lies one of the greatest difficulties. If school pro- 
grams could allow a few hours for these teachers and pupils 
would not mind putting in some extra time during afternoons 
and Saturdays in addition; but with large classes to put all 
excursion work in holiday hours is more than one teacher can 
stand very well. 
Wherever it is possible to draw a crude contour map of a 
region studied it is well to do so. Mere copying of maps is of 
little value, but interpretation is exceedingly profitable. Have 
pupils arrange their notes of an excursion with care and ques- 
tion them closely as to the association of forms studied in the 
field with those discussed in the text. It is often profitable 
to send a small number of pupils to study some features alone 
and report to the class. This can be done many times when 
the teacher can not accompany them. Not only will the men- 
tal training gained by the pupils taught by such method be of 
higher order, but the proper appreciation of the world around 
them will give an added pleasure to their lives always. 
The time is now too short to enter into a discussion of fur- 
ther outlines. While the educational world has been slow to 
recognize the value and practicability of laboratory work in 
Physical Geography, the time is now at hand, I fully believe, 
when it will receive the same amount of attention as the same 
character of lessons do now in chemistry and physics. 
I can not close this paper without acknowledging my in- 
debtedness to Davis, Cornish, Langworthy and others who for 
years past have contributed suggestive laboratory lessons to 
the Journal of Geography. They have been my guide and 
inspiration. These are fighting the battles for correct method 
in teaching and they will win. And in the near future our 
schools will contain all the apparatus essential, our programs 
will be more elastic, and good manuals in the hands of pupils 
not considered a fad and a wasteful extravagance.

THE STUDY OF HYDRAULIC CEMENT. 
Ropert H. MoNerty, Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering, University 
of Mississippi. 
Though it took thousands of years for the world to emerge 
from the ‘ ‘stone age” and merge into the “age of bronze,” so . 
fast come the changes of today that differentiate our time from 
the time gone before that, we can safely say: “In the last de- 
cade we were living in the “age of steel’”—today we are living 
in the “age of concrete.” 
The industrial world is veritably joined together with hy- 
draulic cement. Take it away and you tie the hands of the en- 
gineer. Take it away and his bridges would often crumble to 
mere heaps of sand and pebbles. Great docks and wharves 
would be eaten up by the sea, and whole cities would sink into 
reeking quagmires. 
To a country deficient in the ordinary building materials, 
stone and good brick clay, concrete comes as a God-send, and 
in many parts of the West is even supplying, or, rather, sup- 
planting, the ever-present need of wood. Many parts of the 
South and Southwest (particularly the Mississippi valley) are 
entirely without stone in quarriable formations, yet have right 
at hand or within easy reach gravel suitable for making con- 
crete, with almost invariably an excellent quality of building 
sand; while not infrequently the necessary ingredients for 
making natural or Portland cement are not far distant. 
Usually at least half of the cost of cement is due to trans- 
portation charges upon it, and while it is desirable to use 
cements of maximum strength for the more important founda- 
tions and structures, yet for many purposes an even inferior 
loeal product, if cheap, would serve amply well (as in concrete 
building blocks, foundations for dwellings and the like, where 
great strains do not come upon it.) However, without the 
knowledge and facilities necessary for testing the local product, 
one can use only a brand of cement which has in his experience 
or the experience of his neighbor proved satisfactory. 
Recognizing, then, the importance of local cement to a coun- 
try, it becomes the ‘duty of our technical schools not only to 
teach their students the properties and nature of cement; the 
testing and interpretation of the tests of cement; but also 
to investigate and point out the opportunities in the territory  
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 SouUrHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
around them, to test the manufactured product and to encour- 
age and aid such manufacture. 
To point out, even in a general way, what these investiga- 
tions and tests should consist in, will require a cursory con- 
sideration of the ingredients, manufacture and properties of 
hydraulic cement with its application in concrete and mortar. 
If pure limestone (calcium carborate) is heated to a temper- 
ature above 800 degrees F, the carbon dioxide is driven off, 
leaving calcium oxide or quick-lime. ‘This quicklime is now 
in the form of hard lumps, but if about one-third of its weight 
of water is added, these lumps will swell and crack and fall to 
an impalpable powder. This action of quick-lime is called 
slaking. It is due to a chemical change from calcium oxide to 
calcium hydrate, and is attended with a considerable rise of 
temperature and increase of volume. If an excess of water is 
now added to the slaked lime until it becomes a thick paste, and 
then exposed to the atmosphere, it slowly absorbs carbon di- 
oxide from the air and part of it returns to its original hard 
form of calcium carbonate or limestone, in the course of time. 
This hardening or setting quality is what is utilized in com- 
mon lime mortar, but as a mortar it is subject to many grievous 
disadvantages. It shrinks on setting; the setting is low; it 
will not set under water, and “since the carbon dioxide must 
have access to the lime by the circulation of the air alone, the 
chemical change occurs mostly at the exposed surfaces and does 
not take effect at a distance from the surface except through 
the lapse of long periods of time.” 
For these reasons engineers have long sought a more per- 
fect cement. 
Now if the limestone, which is calcined, contains argillaceous 
impurities (that is to say, clay or shale), the product of the 
kiln gradually loses its property of slaking, but acquires the 
new property of hydraulicity, or setting under water. When 
the percentage of this impurity reaches about 20 per cent. the 
property of slaking has entirely disappeared and the calcined 
limestone presents the appearance of a partially vitrified 
clinker. If this clinker is now ground to an impalpable pow- 
der, this powder will “set quickly upon the addition of about 
one-fourth its weight of water, without any increase of volume, 
and forms a permanent artificial stone which continues harden- 
ing for many years. This ground product of the kiln is known 
as natural cement, because it is made from the natural stone 
without the mechanical admixture of clay.
-P-A-G-E-229
  Tue Stupy or HypRAvLIc CEMENTS 229 
Since pure clay is a hydrated silicate of aluminum, undoubt- 
edly the chemical change which the argillaceous limestone un- 
dergoes when calcined at about 1,000 degrees F. is the forma- 
tion of complex silicates and aluminates of calcium, but just 
what the chemical formule of these salts are is unknown. 
However, it is known that in the calcination process when a 
certain high temperature is passed, other salts are formed 
which do not have the desired properties, and this limiting high 
temperature is reached before the limestone becomes vitrified. 
So we can see that, since the matrix never becomes liquid and 
mixes in the kiln, the chemical change desired will take place 
only when each particle of lime lies actually against a particle 
of clay. So that if we propose to make this mixture of lime- 
stone and clay artificially, we must first grind each very fine 
and thoroughly mix them before calcination. The product of 
this artificial mxture, when treated in the same manner as be- 
fore, is called Portland cement, and is of a higher grade than 
natural cement. 
The setting of hydraulic cement is a very different matter 
from that of lime paste. The initial set begins in one half to 
three hours, and if disturbed before hardening will lose its 
strength; but within seven days it has usually reached suffi- 
cient strength to bear its load. “The setting is theught.to be 
due to the crystalizing out of the silicate and aluminates of 
lime, which are soluble in their anhydrous form. After dissolv- 
ing in water they pass into the hydrated state in which they are 
insoluble and hence are precipitated in a erystaline form, with 
a development of heat.” 
To rapidly consider the chemistry of the manufacture, we 
may say that lime acts as a base and silica and alumina as 
acids. The silica, however, must not be in the form of quartz, 
but in the silicate form, to be able to play its part. 
But the one requisite for an even passible cement is that when 
the manufacture is completed it shall contain no lime uncom- 
bined with silica, alumina or other compounds, because this 
free lime will slack while the cement is in the process of setting 
and destroy the set. On the other hand, if there is an excess of 
the other constituents than lime, they are simply inert and not 
detrimental; and it is for this very requirement natural ce- 
ment is weaker than Portland, because as the chemical composi- 
tion of natural rocks varies from point to point, natural ce- 
ments have to be far on the safe side and contain a larger per- 
cent. of clay, thus increasing the inert partcles in the product.
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Chemical analysis of both limestone and clay suitable for 
cement manufacture shows the following constituents: 
1. Loss on heating—(the carbonic acid and moisture). 
2. Sulphuric anhydride in small quantities, manganese ox- 
ide, ferric oxide, alumina, silica and lime. 
Now from the atomic weights of these constituents we know 
that approximately 1.1 molecules of lime will combine with 1 
molecule of alumina, and 2.8 molecules with 1 of silica. 
Hence, to investigate a limestone and clay for cement manu- 
facture, we have only to take the chemical analysis of each 
and figure from the above proportions what proportion of clay 
we must add to a given limestone to combine with all the lime 
in it, and then we can find the resultant analysis of the mixture. 
And the nearer this mixture approaches the proportion of 
about 65 per cent. lime, 21 per cent. silica and 6 per cent. 
alumina (which is about the best proportion which experience 
indicates) the better cement will be the result. 
From even this meager discussion of the manufacture of 
cement it will easily be seen that though the positively detri- 
mental features be eliminated, many things may occur during 
the process to cause inert particles to be formed which amount 
to just so much sand in the mixture. The formation of these 
may be due to (1) Lack of uniformity in the chemical analysis 
of the stone. (2) Lack of uniformity in mixing. (3) Under- 
burned particles. (4) Overburned particles. (5) Particles not 
ground finely enough to act in the addition of water, and the 
like. 
Thus we may consider commercial cement as being a sub- 
stance containing a certain percentage of adulterant and the 
problem in comparing two cements is to determine the percent- 
age of adulterant. 
Now an engineer never indulges in any scientific investiga- 
tions that are not thrust upon him; but in this case he has 
turned in vain to the chemist and the physicist, so he has had 
to experiment and find out for himself. For this purpose he 
has developed the cement-testing laboratory, and in this la- 
boratory he has come to the following conclusions: 
The strongest and cheapest possible artificial stone he can 
make with the usual materials he can find in practice is con- 
crete, a conglomerate of broken stone or gravel, sand and ce- 
ment mixed in such proportions that the cement will just fill 
the voids or interstices in the sand and the sand and cement will 
just fill the voids of the stone or gravel, so that each particle of
-P-A-G-E-231
  Tue Stupy or Hypravtic CEMENTS 231 
sand, gravel or stone shall be separated from every other by a 
film of cement. And he finds that concrete thus made is 
stronger in compression than pure cement blocks. 
Likewise he find that the best mortar is one in which the 
cement just fills the voids of the sand. 
Since the inert particles act as just so much sand, he evi- 
dently can not determine the comparative percentage of inert 
substances in two cements by comparing the relative weights © 
which will crush blocks of pure cement, for cement mixed with 
sand is often stronger in compression than pure cement. How- 
ever, he has found that the cohesion of cement is greater than 
is adhesion to foreign particles, consequently to obtain a true 
index of the percentage of inert substances he makes a 
briquette of pure cement and determines the number of pounds 
it will take to pull it apart. However, this is a test which 
requires much care to make the conditions under which each 
test is made exactly the same. Many other tests must be 
made before he can pass on the true value of a cement. He 
must test the fineness to which the cement is ground, whether 
there is any free lime, the specific gravity, the length of time 
it takes to set, ete., and finally must compare the two ce- 
ments upon the basis of cost before he can determine which 
is the most economical for use in a given piece of work. 
In the engineering laboratory it further devolves upon him 
to determine the special properties of the various mixtures of 
cement and sand, and of concrete, and to obtain data concern- 
ing their strength for use in designing his structures. 
Since in our technical schools are usually the only facilities 
for this kind of work in the South we should expect of them 
in additon to teaching their students how to analyze, test and 
understand cement, and concrete, first, to prospect the country 
around them for sand, gravel, limestone and clay; second, to 
test and analyze these; third, to actually manufacture cement 
on a small scale if the chemical analysis justifies, and fourth, 
to publish the result of these investigations and encourage the 
manufacture on a large scale. 
In writing this I have had continually in mind a large 
section of country bordering on the Tombigbee river, whose 
limestone bluffs furnish an excellent material for cement manu- 
facture. This limestone formation extends over a large por- 
tion of Alabama and far into Mississippi. At Macon, Miss. 
(about fifty miles north of Meridian), I am familiar with the 
formation and found it so soft as to be easily dug into with pick

and shovel, which would greatly facilitate the first grinding. 
An excellent clay lies between beds of this limestone, sand of 
an excellent quality is at hand, gravel can be gotten delivered 
on the cars for about 60 or 75 cents per yard. I have tested 
this same formation about 150 miles farther south and find it 
an excellent material: for cement manufacture, and do not 
doubt the same is true of the limestone 'at Macon. There is a 
factory located now at Demopolis, Ala., on the Tombigbee. 
With the growing use of hollow conerete building blocks I 
can. safely say that a country which has this limestone and clay, 
with sand, gravel and abundant fuel in easy reach, has a min- 
eral wealth surpassing that of gold mines, and with sufficient 
transportation facilities nothing can stop the growth of this in- 
dustry. 
Before leaving the subject of cement, however, I wish to 
point out that most of the purely scientific investigations which 
have lead to the development of cement and its manufacture 
have been carried on by engineers, and in this connection I 
can not refrain from quoting from Dr. Waddell: 
“The aim of pure science is discovery, but the purpose of 
engineering is usefulness. The delvers in the mysterious labor- 
atories, the mathematical gymnasts, the scholars poring over 
musty tomes of knowledge, are not understood by a work-a-day 
world, nor do they understand it. But between stands the en- 
gineer with keen and sympathetic appreciation of the value of 
the work of the one, and a ready understanding of the needs 
and requirements of the other; and by his power of adapta- 
bility he grasps the problems presented, takes from the investi- 
gators their abstract results and transforms them into practical 
usefulness for the world.”

Professor Edward F. Buchner, University of Alabama, read 
a paper on “A Qualified Teaching Force,” which was discussed 
and supplemented by Professor Wickliffe Rose, Peabody Col- 
lege for Teachers.”” The paper and discussion are given below. 
Officers for the ensuing ‘year were elected as follows:

It is among the traditions of this department, I believe, that 
the discussions shall originate from, if not be led by, active rep- 
resentatives of “normal” instruction. Those who standardize 
teaching have been called upon to set the bounds to your discus- 
sions and to introduce the main facts for your considerations. 
Why you have allowed your excellent tradition to lapse is a 
query we need not pause to answer. It is with frankness that 
I make the confession of having, at no time, labored in the 
vineyard known as “normal.” It is my misfortune—or fortune 
—to belong to the group frequently known by others as 
“theorists.” Yet, throughout an academic activity extending 
over a period of thirteen years, it has been my privilege to labor  
-P-A-G-E-234

at the problems ‘of education and to aid, where possible, 
teachers, both those who have had riper years and forms of 
experience than myself, and those who were simply looking for- 
ward to the more or less temporary career of teaching. This is 
my only apology for letting your tradition go by the boards and 
accepting the generous invitation of your officers to present 
something on this occasion. 
Another confession is needed to put us at our ease, and to 
relieve you from the delusion of a mere luncheon when expect- 
ing a full dinner. When consenting to accept the final discre- 
tion of your worthy secretary, my utmost surmise did not pass 
beyond the possibility of presenting a tail-end paper on the 
program of this particular department. My conscience could 
really be clear at this time only after a year’s nipping and filing 
at the theme which is to be the sole topic of an annual discus- 
sion. It would have been a great relief could it have been pos- 
sible for me to free at the beginning this occasion from 
that too common trait of teachers to display ideas without being 
in a sufficient state of preparedness. Oock-sure-ness is one of 
the banes of the profession. The tons of current printed educa- 
tional discussions testify to the prevalence of the readiness of 
the teacher to write and speak—and then think, after the pro- 
ceedings come from the press. Such, certainly, is not the best 
qualification for those who teach. 
We American teachers should recognize the fact that, in spite 
of the absence of federal educational laws, it is now our boast 
to possess an official literature upon the subject of the qualifica- 
tion of teachers. It is in no wise my purpose to encroach upon, 
or to attempt to interpret the mature conclusions and the 
specific recommendations of the memorable reports of the 
Committee of Fifteen, presented 1895, and of the Committee of 
Twelve, presented 1897, respectively, to the National Educa- 
tional Association. Why the rural schools should thus have 
received an apostolic benediction is not easy to understand; but 
that they needed it, we would all readily agree. Each of these 
reports takes up specifically the preparation of teachers for their 
tasks as school keepers and as molders of the next generation. 
In each report we have the concreted wisdom of a special sub- 
committee. The training of elementary and secondary school 
teachers is one ofthe three topics considered by the fifteen 
committeemen, while the supply of teachers for the rural 
schools is one of the main topics of the Committee of Twelve.
-P-A-G-E-235
A QuALIFIeED TEACHING Force 235 
Every supervising officer in our school systems and every 
student of recent educational history are thoroughly familiar 
with the ideals of these expert leaders of our schools. These 
official voices no less speak from the actual workings of our 
school systems, and should therefore be heard without interrup- 
tion. Giving these reports their proper places, we may turn 
aside to follow the trend of interests as they may appeal to us 
assembled here today. 
Ever since the days of Francke, Gesner, Hecker and Wolf in 
the several forms of German educational institutions in the 
eighteenth century, the school world is saying less and less 
frequently, “the teacher is born,’ and more and more fre- 
quently, “the teacher is made.” At the present time, the mak- 
ing of the teacher is an unending problem; for, no sooner is 
one made, than our school systems need a dozen, so rapid are 
the changes in the professional personnel, the growth of our 
population, and the modifications of our schools. 
From a logical point of view, also, the teacher and his train- 
ing are proably the most important questions in every form of 
education. As the teacher, so the school. As the teacher, 30 
the pupil. While the school necessarily and fundamentally 
exists for the sake of the child, and should be pedo-centric, the 
school cannot be kept in its orbit as revolving about the child 
without the guiding hand and thought of the teacher. 
The sheet anchor for every constructive discussion of this 
subject is not far to find. In spite of all the variations and 
changes in educational creeds and practices, one thought re- 
mains unchanged. That thought is this: he who teaches must 
possess at least certain qualifications in order to discharge the 
duties of that office. Successful teaching is simply a result of 
fitness. A thought, which is so ancient, must therefore at once 
rob us of all anticipation of something new or novel. So stand- 
ard is this idea, that any current opportunity to consider it 
only presents an occasion for another person to express himself 
and thus “go on record.” 
Quintilian insisted that the teacher’s “first care should be to 
ascertain with all possible thoroughness the mind and the char- 
acter of the child.” Rousseau makes internals central. Says 
he: “The first qualification I should require in him (the 
tutor), and this one presupposes many others, is, that he shall 
not be capable of selling himself. There are employments so 
noble that we cannot fulfil them for money without showing 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
236 SournERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ourselves unworthy to fulfil them. Such an employment is 
that of a soldier; such a one is that of a teacher. * * * A 
teacher! what a great soul he ought to be! Truly, to form a 
man, one must be either himself a father, or else something 
more than human. And this is the office you calmly entrust to 
hirelings!” 
The fitness of the teacher is a vital problem in every stage of 
educational development. It is, likewise and accordingly, a 
necessary problem today. We would miss the teaching of edu- 
cational history if we do not see the point that throughout past 
times the qualifications vary either according to the type of the 
thinker, or to the type of the times in which the thinker thinks, 
or both. In our day, the central question is, what are the de- 
mands made upon the teacher’s qualifications by the times? 
And by “times” we must interpret not only the status of the 
social whole, but specifically inquire into the exigencies of the 
school, the demands of children as progressively known, the 
demands of the subjects of study, and, not least, the demands 
of the patrons and the general public which resort to the out- 
put of the schools for the constructive factors in doing the work 
of the world. 
As construers of educational necessities, it is essential that we 
get a vital grasp upon the historic fact that there is a marked 
concensus of opinion and legal enactment upon the one point 
namely, that the true teacher can be described in terms pretty 
much the same the world round. If the teacher were not a 
positive dynamic social factor, I presume this unanimity of 
thought and description would be absolutely impossible. For 
one more illustrative instance, I turn to a legal document issued 
in Prussia in 1819, where we may read: 
“Tn order that a master may be enabled to fulfil the duties of 
his station, he ought to be religious, wise, and alive to the high 
importance of his profession. He ought thoroughly to under- 
stand the duties of his station, to have acquired the art of teach- 
ing and managing youth, to be firm in his fidelity to the 
state, conscientious in the discharge of his duties, friendly and 
prudent in his relations with the parents of his children, and 
with his fellow-citizens in general; finally, he ought to inspire 
all around him with a lively interest in the progress of the 
school, and to render them favorably inclined to second his own 
wishes and endeavors.” 
Can more fitting language be found or manufactured in 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
    A QuaLiriep TEACHING Force 237 
which to describe the characteristics of that particular teacher 
whom parents and citizens desire to preside over their schools 
and the destinies of their children? How can we secure the 
education of such school masters? That is the recurrent prob- 
lem of the qualified teaching force. 
QUALIFICATIONS—WHY REQUIRED. 
The only single answer to be given to the inquiries concern- 
ing the teacher’s fitness, is: the “perfect” man, and the “per- 
fect”? woman. The golden age of all civilized races, however, 
continually abides in the future. It thus becomes needful that 
specifications be made of the general and the technical qualific: 
tions required of the teacher. By qualification must be under- 
stood that which makes the teacher to be such. It makes 
him a “good” teacher from the professional point of view. 
It means schoolroom ability, and finally becomes school-making. 
We must distinguish at the outstart between the qualifications 
as they exist or are recognized by statute requirement, and the 
qualifications which educational reflection conceives as properly 
belonging to the teacher as such. In school systems, the former 
is a matter of quid facti; the latter, of quid juris. Between 
these two extremes of that which exists and that which should 
be, there is always and necessarily a conflict. This struggle is 
wholesome. For, out of it, comes that progress for which we 
are always looking. 
But, why should qualifications be required of teachers at all? 
Do the concurrent opinions of different peoples have any sensi- 
ble or rational basis? or,-is qualification merely a local hobby, 
which can find no justification either in the nature of human 
society or in the nature of human skill and dexterity? Three 
reasons appeal to me as fully justifying the almost universal 
demand of unprejudiced thought and formal authority for the 
training of teachers for their work. 
First, ¢ducation is a progressive science. It is not given in 
its completeness at any one time or at any one place. No in- 
dividual can encompass it. It is not something that can be 
learned in a single lesson, nor that to which adequate adaptation 
can be made with the acquisition of a definite number of stipu- 
lated reactions. It stands, on the contrary, in universal rela- 
tions with the history and the present potency of human society. 
It follows the lead of enquiring thought, which attempts to 
explain human variation and human progress. In its own
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
field education is progressive. The teacher is one who must 
“keep up;” and this demand cannot be satisfactorily met with- 
out that preliminary preparation which enables the struggler to 
short-cut his way through the mazes of new advances in interpre- 
tation of principles and the application of new devices for the 
realization of definite school ends. 
Again, the teacher needs training, because he has not the 
opportunity of working independently. Were all pupils Rob- 
inson Orusoes, and every teacher merely a tutor, we might then 
conceive of the possibility of such teachers as.not requiring any 
particular qualification. The teacher in a school, the teacher 
of a child destined to live in an organized human society (how- 
ever simple or complex its organization), is permanently con- 
fronted with justifiable limitations which are the essentials of 
all organization. The limitations of the teacher increase the 
requirement of qualification. The teacher’s curriculum is 
practically made for him. It is handed down largely by tradi- 
tion. It is also determined for him to some extent by the 
enactments of the law or of the authoritative superintendent. If 
not by these, then it is determined by his very imitative pro- 
cesses which are set agoing by the critics of his school and his 
methods, who constantly and freely compare his school with the 
schools found in other neighborhoods. “Something better than 
our school” is a test which no real teacher, or community even, 
can stand for a long time without yielding. The teacher is also 
limited through his very apparatus. His text-books are not of 
his own manufacture. Yet he must learn to use them. Par- 
ticularly is this true in the wave of uniformity which is making 
us all wet alike. 
The natures of his pupils are not of his own making, but are 
independent of him. Herein we find one of the most persistent 
and varied limitations under which the teacher must do his 
work. The school plan is for the most part fixed by the super- 
intendent or the principal, even in cases where statute law does 
not extend this far in school matters. The social life of the 
school is not less foreign to the teacher, setting a limitation of 
which he must be fully conscious if he is to succeed in his 
undertaking. The great course of human civilization is an 
over-towering educational agency, over which the teacher cannot 
climb, but to which he must bend in every movement he makes, 
whether in language, history, science or art. 
In spite of all these limitations, the teacher must learn to use
-P-A-G-E-239
agen ae ee 
A QUALIFIED TEACHING. ForcE 239 
all of these in an harmonious manner, and to bring their fruition 
toa common end. The true wonder of it is that many teachers 
sometimes succeed in spite of the vast heterogeneity which sur- 
rounds them. And, do we ourselves fully appreciate the lim- 
itations under which teachers are compelled to do their varied 
work? These very limitations make expertness necessary on 
their part. Here is a fundamental requirement for teacher 
training. The school historically has wrought order and sym- 
metry out of all these limitations, and the teacher must be 
so intelligent of the results of this historical progress as to 
step into the school and continue its realization of a net result in 
human training. 
The third reason which demands teacher qualification is more 
than a corollary of the foregoing. It is the fact of specializa- 
tion of function which makes the training of teachers a neces- 
sity, both for society and for the school. This specialization is 
two-fold: (a) teaching itself is a specialty different from the 
other vocations which social progress has thus far differentiated ; 
(b) within the field of teaching there are minuter specialties, 
such as those fixed by the type of school, by grades within a 
single school, and by the different subjects which are taught and 
practised in the school. There are also the demands based upon 
the peculiarities of child growth and behavior. And also those 
which are made by the logical and the genetic development of 
the subjects of study. 
There may be other grounds for the demand of qualification 
upon the part of the teacher, which appeal more strongly to 
others. But these three seem to me to be adequate to meet the 
needs, not only of delinquent teachers who need to be urged to 
put forth greater efforts in their own professional behalf, but 
also strong enough to induce the minds of the lay public to see 
the need of demanding proper qualifications on the part of 
teachers in order to raise the standards of their local schools. 
One of the peculiar handicaps of educational progress is the 
fact that this is a field in which the average person is rather dis- 
posed to think and to act, when official opportunity offers, as 
though he knew all about it. Quite the reverse is true when it 
comes to most of the other arts and professions. Perhaps, after 
all, this is not an unmitigated evil in educational growth, for 
teaching probably lies closer to the social consciousness of the 
race than any other organic interest. And, by exercising its 
functions properly, the school comes eventually to destroy the 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
240 SovuTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
very condition upon which it originally feeds. This is accom- 
plished by educating the public to see that teaching is not a 
mere matter of opinion, but of assured knowledge, and also 
because mistakes in this line of social dynamics tend, on the 
whole, to hide themselves more readily and more easily than 
the fundamental mistakes in the other professions and practical 
arts. In this respect, education is exceptional. 
QUALIFICATIONS—-WHAT OUGHT THEY BE? 
There can be only two views held upon the point as to 
whether any qualifications are needed to make the teacher: 
either they are, or they are not needed. Difficulties begin to 
arise when. those who answer the preceding question in the 
affirmative endeavor to state just what are the qualifications de- 
manded. It is impossible to speak in a general way that would 
be acceptable to all educational workers. This is not discour- 
aging, for herein we come upon the ideality that inheres in 
the work of school building. Any age and any individual 
stamp the impress of their ideals unmistakably upon their con- 
ceptions of what is required to make the teacher a teacher and 
something different from everybody else. 
It is probable that there has always been a tendency among 
men, where schools have flourished at all, to hold that only 
one requirement exists. This is the idea that a liberal educa- 
tion is at the same time a training for teaching. This con- 
tinues to be current in popular educational thought. Let 
us frankly admit that this idea is not merely a result of preju- 
dice, but an idea that has some merits upon which it can 
stand. The most plausible is, probably, that, since a youth 
has been educated, he therefore knows all about education, and 
ean forthwith make an adequate teacher. It is hard to get our 
colleges and our universities at large weaned away from this 
primitive notion. It is also no easy task to lead school officials 
to see that anything more might be needed as a requisite for 
success in teaching. This will account for most of the multi- 
tude of college graduates turning to the schools as “hirelings” 
for a season, to satisfy a meagre purse, or to shorten the time 
until the other desired profession opens its doors. 
As a possible help to our discussions I suggest the following 
classification of the qualifications which a teacher ought to pos- 
sess. Any essential trait falls into one or more of these groups: 
(a) Natural qualifications; (b) academic qualifications;  
-P-A-G-E-241
A QUALIFIED TEACHING ForcE 241 
(ec) professional qualifications; (d) experiential qualifica- 
tions. 
Natural qualifications are such as originate in the native 
abilities of the individual, in his heredity, in that make-up 
which he possesses for which he needs to thank “his stars” 
only. Teaching has thus long been classed as one of the 
““oifts,” the lack of which can not be replaced by post-natal 
efforts, no matter how serious and persistent. These are the 
endowments of one’s personality, about whose true origin we are 
so much in the dark tcday. It is the recognition of these to 
the exclusion of all other qualifications that has led the historic 
mind to conceive of the teacher as being “born” and as not made. 
Academic qualifications are such as can, with a fair degree 
of intelligence and opportunity, be acquired by attendance upon 
schools. They sometimes are made identical with “general 
culture.” They vary more according to the schools attended 
than according to the native abilities of the individual. Edu- 
cational institutions can become very self-conscious in attempt- 
ing to discriminate between the relative values of other. insti- 
tutions, particularly in the ranks of secondary and higher edu- 
cation. 
Professional qualifications are those which are acquired 
by the special study of education and the practice of its prin- 
ciples. It means the definite training to think and to act along 
educational lines as determined by the most scientific treat- 
ment of the problems of the school and the child of which such 
material is capable. It is the knowledge and the training 
which, once fully possessed, make the teacher an expert in his 
vocation. 
Experiential qualifications are such as arise from actual 
experience in the school room, and are to be acquired by each 
individual for himself. They are usually regarded as cumu- 
lative. School officials are quite right in inquiring into the 
“experience” a given candidate may have had prior to his ap- 
plication. This group of traits cannot be pushed too far, since 
the teacher, either in training or otherwise, must begin his ac- 
tivity before the qualities thus to be acquired are in, his posses- 
sion. This fourth group thus makes up the confessedly prag- 
matic test, which determines the fitness of the teacher. 
It is not a safe thing to stop and point out which of these is 
the most important. We happen to be living in an age when 
the professional qualifications are accentuated into greater im-
-P-A-G-E-242
  242 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
portance than almost all the others combined. This is happily 
a culmination of the development in normalization of the past 
century. Previous epochs have selected some one of the others 
as the most important. We, however, should be fair to our- 
selves and to the truth in the matter, and say that each group 
of qualifications has its relative importance, inasmuch as they 
are all essential in the making of the teacher and in aiding the 
teacher to make the school. And, after all, school making is 
the important thing in this modern day of education. Our 
divorce of the teacher as a personality and as an individuality 
from the school as the underlying, permanent thing has been 
responsible for that lack of zeal which has depleted our teaching 
ranks and kept our school in such an annual state of turmoil. 
May we not hope for the day when the teacher will be permitted 
to allow his identity to be swallowed up in the life of the 
school? We never think of Arnold alone; but it is always 
Arnold “of Rugby.” We never think of Thring alone; but 
it is always Thring “of Uppingham.” 
These four types are frequently confused; and often are 
not separated at all in judging of the worth of a teacher. 
No less frequently one type of qualities is accepted as answer- 
ing the place of all the others. Among trained school men, 
however, they are all recognized, and inquired into; but prob- 
ably not with the distinctness with which they appear in a short 
table of enumeration. It is not my purpose to adhere to these 
groups in the treatment which may follow. I wish to feel 
freer than such a scheme would permit at the present moment. 
Lose sight of them and their significance, we shall not do in 
the listing of the essential qualities to which we now turn. 
High moral character is absolutely and fundamentally essen- 
tial in the make-up of ‘a teacher. The recognition of duty and 
the practice of its law should be well developed in him who 
is to teach. The ethical end of education, and the moral values 
of human life make this demand very emphatic. Self-controi 
is also the basal principle in school management. The sombre 
teacher is not necessarily the most moral nor the most volitional. 
Cheerfulness must be added in the work of the school room. 
This character also involves sympathy for the child in his re- 
peated efforts at the problems of school life. Indeed, the true 
teacher knows more of altruism, when rightly understood, than 
the practicer of almost any other profession. This is what we 
popularly call “the missionary spirit.”
-P-A-G-E-243
  A Quatiriep TEACHING ForcE 243 
There must also be a fundamental devotion to the calling. 
As some one has said, there must be a decided “lack of dislike 
of teaching.” This virtue must become positive, and appear 
as real enthusiasm for the work. Enthusiasm is frequently a 
possession which gives the teacher a momentum of great carry- 
ing power when knotty situations arise in the art of school- 
making. We should not confuse this devotion with the motive 
for teaching. The current widespread agitation of the salary 
question must not be interpreted as reflecting upon the genu- 
ineness of interest which teachers have in their work. The 
reasons why one teaches may be as diverse as the necessities of 
material and spiritual living. On the other hand, one may 
teach for the salary, without necessarily allowing that reason 
to lessen the interest in the work itself. 
The teacher must also present the major portion of that 
platform upon which he and his pupil must cooperate in their 
mutual work. This platform is sympathy. Pestalozzi was 
right; teaching is reaching child life through love. Without 
this there may be mechanical and perfunctory instruction for 
the moment only, but nothing more. 
Vigorous health and other personal traits rightly belong to 
the teacher we are describing. The actual work of school keep- 
ing is in itself severe. It makes a heavy draft upon the vitality 
of the teacher, particularly in the case of woman. At least so 
much good health must be in constant possession as to enable 
the teacher to be cheerful in doing the daily work of the school. 
Teaching is not an “easy job,” as many a young and unhealthy 
tyro soon discovers. To this good health should be added the 
care of the body, both for the sake of that health and for the 
sake of personal appearance. The teacher must feel well and 
look well, even beautiful, when possible. The teacher is the 
source of the chief and most lasting impressions in the school 
which play upon the child. He offers a persistent and living 
example of those qualities which slowly grow in childhood. 
And he should not be a representative of that perverse power 
of unhealthy conditions over mental qualities. What we have 
come to recognize through the teachings of physiological psy- 
chology and physiological pedagogies as to the value of the 
physical. substrate in the school life of the child, we must fully 
admit in the case of the teacher. The dyspeptic and the in- 
fected must be ruled from the control of our school rooms. 
No less should the slovenly and unkempt teacher be admitted
-P-A-G-E-244
244 SovuTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
to the exalted position of controlling the tastes of our children. 
Excellent native ability should mark the teacher. He dare 
not be intellectually lazy. He should be alive to all possibilities 
of enlarging his acquaintance with the nature of his pupils and 
the conditions of school activity. One of the peculiar traits 
and merits of a trained teacher is that he knows how to seek 
opportunity in his class and other school work to get experience 
for himself. This vital supplement to his normal training is 
the constant condition of keeping abreast the growing needs of 
his pupils. These original observations are of immense im- 
portance to him in the construction of the rational groundwork 
of his procedure. The modification of his successive adapta- 
tions are also largely based upon the vigor and intelligence of 
these experiences. This native ability enables him to present 
that spontaneity which is so characteristic of the teacher whom 
we generally speak of as “alive and awake.” 
The general scholarship of the teacher should be sound and 
wide. More teachers are discredited both in the school and in 
public opinion by reason of imperfect or pedantic scholarship 
than for almost all other reasons combined. Here we meet 
with standards of valuation which are applied to teachers by 
those who are outside the ranks of the official critics of the 
teacher. The teacher needs not only the scholarship of the 
text-book and of the reference book, but he must have that 
degree of learning, which is not small by any means, that will 
enable him not only to appreciate, but also to construct, educa- 
tional values of subjects and training. It takes wide knowledge 
and repeated thinking to bring out the relational values of 
what the school compels the child to acquire. Why the school 
is entitled to make these requirements of the pupil must be an- 
swered by the teacher in a progressive manner. Every super- 
intendent knows the inestimable worth of those teachers whose 
knowledge enables them to measure up evenly with the modern 
club matrons in the community. Such teachers help to mold 
public opinion in favor of the school in a definite way. 
We must not forget to recognize the fact that scholarship, as 
ordinarily understood and measured by examinations and cer- 
tificates, is only quantitative. Officials become interested 
chiefly in how much the given teacher knows and remembers. 
We overlook the fact that scholorship has also its qualitative 
aspect. This is of greater value still. The teacher who pos- 
sesses a qualitative scholarship is one of scholarly tastes.

     A Quaurn TEACHING ForcE 245 
He appreciates the fact that the field of knowledge before the 
child is not bounded by the apparatus in the school nor by the 
books that might perchance fall into the pupil’s hand. The 
qualitative inspiration must be given to our children. They 
must learn that the completion of a given text-book is not the 
completion of the subject studied. And what teacher is there 
in the higher grades of instruction that does not have to fight 
year in and year out against that limitation under which the 
more elementary instruction leaves pupils, namely, of having 
studied this or that, and therefore as knowing it all. 
Professional scholarship and training is ‘the last qualifica- 
tion to be named in this list. Last because it is the last to be 
acquired and that which really presupposes all the others.. In 
the history of school keeping we have at last, though slowly, 
brought ourselves to see that the teacher is not only one who 
knows a subject of study in a general cultural way, but he also 
knows that subject in terms of ability to teach it. “The proper 
study of the teacher is the pupil.” In making the child the 
center of the whole plan of education, we are demanding that 
the teacher shall not merely teach reading, geography, or his- 
tory, but the child as a reader, as a geographer, as a historian. 
There is a danger of overdoing this matter where pedagogical 
methodism reigns supreme, and letting the child disappear be- 
tween the subject-matter and the method. But on the whole, 
we have here a touchstone which can always bring us back to 
the fundamental conditions under which teaching is to be 
carried on. 
The distinction between general and professional scholar- 
ship has probably been more clearly expressed by Lakanal a 
century ago than by any other contributor to our stock of edu- 
cational ideas. The true teacher is the person who, while 
teaching you to know one thing, teaches you to reason upon all 
things. The secret of this double accomplishment is method, 
understood in its widest possible sense. This is what makes 
the teacher’s knowledge of a subject so different, in the begin- 
ning of instruction, at least, so radically different from the pu- 
pil’s knowledge of the same. This means that there must be a 
reconstruction of knowledge for the sake of teaching, based 
upon the psychology of the mental processes involved in acquir- 
ing that knowledge and upon the pedagogical principles by fol- 
lowing which the teacher is enabled to bring the pupil to a 
proper insight into the relations upon which that knowledge is 
    
-P-A-G-E-246
  246 SourHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
based. This idea of the double office of teaching helps us to see 
how teaching is a central activity of life. Thereby we can dis- 
cover that true teaching universalizes itself by making the 
taught child an intellectually independent citizen in the world 
of learning. It must be admitted that too many teachers are 
blind to the relation of teaching the elements of knowledge, to 
the life work of the child beyond the limits of the school. Fail- 
ure to appreciate this relation leaves the teacher in that slough 
from which school work is regarded as merely so much informa- 
tion, rather than training. Keeping this basic idea in mind 
enables the teacher to free himself from the too common notion 
that methods of teaching are mere conveniences for doing this 
thing and that thing in school. 
Perhaps you will not mind if to the already long list I add 
one more qualification that enters into the teacher’s make-up. 
Professional respect and dignity belong to the true development 
of the art of teaching. Too much school keeping is carried on 
in an apologetic manner. What true minister is there who 
does not always think his pulpit the best place in the world? 
What true lawyer can be found who does not feel that the 
bar is the true arena of life’s best possibilities for him? But 
how many are the teachers who sanctify the desk as their holy 
of holies? This qualification gives coloring and setting to all 
the others. It is fundamental in the prerequisites for the 
development of a system of public schools. The lack of this 
attitude has made the pedagogue the butt of jest and the object 
of caricature ever since the early Grecian days. 
QUALICATIONS—HOW CAN THEY BE ACQUIRED? 
For a full answer to this third chief question, there neither 
remains the time nor the need in this connection. A simple 
list of educative institutions stretching over the wide ranges 
between the kindergarten and the university and between 
general and technical schools might suffice for one who seeks 
such an enumeration. We now have a perfect hierarchy of 
institutions which profess to prepare teachers. Another might 
expect the presentation of certain so-called principles which 
should be observed in the process which is to enable the future 
teacher to acquire the qualifications required. Presupposing 
all these as well within the bounds of your acquaintance, I wish 
to call attention to a few related points. 
The future well trained teacher ought to see to it that he 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
A QuALIFIeD TEACHING ForcE 247 
is well born. We are a little slow in recognizing that there 
might be such a thing as pedagogical heredity. Other things 
being equal, I should prefer to have been the son of a teacher. 
The children of our present generation of teachers ought to pro- 
vide the next generation with a true teacher caste. One of the 
serious misfortunes of cur schools in the past has been the hered- 
itary illiteracy which has stood behind our teachers’ desks. 
Too frequently it happens that the future teacher has not had 
a stimulating educational environment during the early years 
of life. This lack has telling effect upon his professional de- 
ficiency. 
All men agree that a good general education, secured by 
bona fide graduation from the high school, or the academy, the 
normal school, the college, or the university, ought to be the 
basis for the latter acquisitions. To go to school is the prelim- 
inary step to keeping school. This first step also means that 
the future teacher shall acquire real knowledge. It shall be 
assimilated. It shall be a knowledge of books and of ‘the life 
lived in the world at large. 
This general education should extend as far as possible be 
yond the grade of instruction which the teacher is to give. The 
elementary school as such cannot prepare teachers. The 
teacher must be culturally and pedagogically at home in a field 
larger than that in which he is going to lead his own pupils. 
The grading of instruction by schools from the elementary to 
the higher well makes this provision immediately realizable, 
_ and offers a standard by which a teacher’s probable possession 
of fitness can be determined in a preliminary way. This rela- 
tion between training and teaching explains largely why the 
normal schools as such have historically trained the teacher sup- 
ply for the elementary schools and the college and the university 
the supply for the higher schools. 
The necessary ripening of all the foregoing qualifications de- 
mands that the teacher carry on actively and systematically a 
post-school training and study. Oity superintendents are almost 
unanimous in their declarations that the after-school training 
of teachers is the most persistent and emphatic problem which 
they have to solve in keeping their teaching force up to. the 
standard. This has created many of the post-school adjuncts 
to the teacher’s growth, such as special books and periodicals, 
extension lectures, institutes, summer schools, educational 
libraries and the like. To secure healthy professional growth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
248 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
there must be constant study about education while practicing 
its art. A mere repetition of the old topics, bare reviews of text- 
books, are not sufficient in this matter. The teacher can come 
to a full possession of these qualifications (and I mean only 
those which can be acquired, for some of them are originally 
possessed) by trying to have the great minds of the race do for 
them what they are daily trying to do for the pupils under their 
charge. For this reason we should pattern after the teacher 
who Platonizes or Spencerizes his educational ideas. Such a 
teacher is firmly established and carries on his educational art 
in a fully conscious manner. He is the master of the situa- 
tion. Different individuals find different plans for the main- 
tenance of this post-school training satisfactory. And, I sup- 
pose, each one must find out for himself how he can best keep 
growing as a teacher after he leaves behind him the beneficent 
influences of his own ‘teachers. 
QUALIFICATIONS—HOW DETERMINED. 
Every one believes himself to be better than he is. Every one 
feels a finer degree of proficiency than his doing warrants us in 
believing him to possess. Such is the way of human nature. 
Men have long been seeking an absolutely impersonal and un- 
prejudiced mode of arriving at a judgment of the qualities and 
attainments of others. Human valuation, however, is always 
and only a matter of human judgment. How can we make that 
judging accurate and trustworthy, is, from the teacher’s stand- 
point, the final problem in the organization of an extended sys- 
tem of schools. The valuation of the teacher’s fitness is thus a 
vital part of qualification taken as a whole. These qualifica- 
tions must be known in terms of degrees. One of the regretta- 
able limitations of such valuation is that it must always be 
done in terms of quantity, whereas teaching is more a matter 
of quality. 
In private schools the partial and interested judgment of 
those who chance to be in general authority may suffice to 
estimate the fitness of the individuals given places on the teach- 
ing staff. In a system of public or state schools, including 
city as well as country, the best means discovered thus far for 
the evaluation of teachers is the creation of an expert authority 
which shall be made official. This eliminates the personal, and 
consequent partial factors in the judgments. The officer, 
whether the state superintendent, the state board, or the board 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
A QUALIFIED TEACHING Force 249 
of a single school, can discharge this critical function in the 
freest manner only when maintaining the ideals of fairness 
expressed in their rules. 
Jertification of quantitative fitness is the best attainment 
yet reached in this direction. Submitting teachers to uniform 
examinations within the field of a given territory or author- 
ity, such as the state or the city examination, is as far as 
our wisdom has carried us, and this obtains in only twelve 
states in the Union. Such examinations have their limitations. 
In the main, they test cram and scholarship only. All the 
qualifications enumerated above cannot be tested by such ex- 
amination. Character, worth, native ability, common sense, 
pedagogic instinct, lie beyond the reach of the formal exam- 
iner. So intimately, however, are the various qualities of a 
good teacher interrelated and interdependent that, under our 
present ideals of living and standards of classing schools, the 
odds are in favor of the certificated teacher as also possessing 
the other qualities. 
One fundamental mistake in our practical educational think- 
ing and customs is to confuse the certification with the selection 
of teachers. To select a teacher for a given school or a given 
grade is vastly different from testifying that a given individual 
has the fitness of a teacher generally speaking. For the de- 
termination of the points at stake in this instance, we must 
go beyond the formal examination, and seek such means as 
credentials, personal interviews, the testimony of observers, and 
the record established during the process of training. Each 
of these means must be constantly regarded as relative, and as 
possessing different values. Personal interviews between offi- 
cers and applicants are most satisfactory. Oredentials of all 
kinds, on the other hand, are typically the most unsatisfactory 
means of judging the fitness of a given teacher. They are 
misleading, and are based usually upon a very partial judg- 
ment. The testimony of fellow teachers ought to come to be 
of special value, yielding, as it should, the impartial evidence 
of experts. At some distant day we may come to have boards 
of teachers as experts, rather than trustees and school commit- 
‘tees, who shall determine in the fairest way the fitness of indi- 
vidual teachers. Until that day is here we must abide the 
overweening confidence of untrained officials in all grades of 
our school systems and the nervous desire of teachers to keep 
getting better and better positions as a mere matter of individ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 SourHERN EpuCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ual ambition and professional spoils. Worse than this is the 
practice, not yet extinct, of sending out licensed teachers who 
have passed no specific test of their abilities; and still worse is 
the lack of centralization of certificating authority within a 
given political division, such as the state. 
Finally, education is not a matter of the individual, but of 
the state, the government. The teacher is a state official. And 
the state should maintain a conscious participation in the equip- 
ment and testing of teachers. It is logical for the state to main- 
tain schools for its future citizens. It is stultifying for the 
state not to see to it that the teachers in those schools are prop- 
erly trained. We have long since had state normal and train- 
ing schools. The last link in the chain is of slow forging. 
The state scheme of education is complete only when the teach- 
er is by state authority given official cognizance, and that by 
right of the possession of eminent fitness to return into the 
schools and perpetuate in the conscious life of children the 
ideals of civilized government. 
Tn conclusion, we should recognize that in the perpetuation 
and improvement of our schools the teacher is, after all, only 
one of the central forces involved. Too frequently it so hap- 
pens that there is the system and the teachers. They are 
scarcely given a berth in that great organization which we call 
our city and county schools. The legislator, the trustee, the 
superintendent, the taxpayer, the parent, even, are often more 
influential in determining the limits of what our chools are to 
be than the best trained teachers in the system. In longing for 
the time when every teacher will approximate our ideals in the 
matter of qualification, let us strive to give the imperfect teach- 
ers of the present a larger consciousness of significance in the 
world work of education.

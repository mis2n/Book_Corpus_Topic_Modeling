  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
One of the outstanding features of educational de- 
velopment in the United States during the last thirty 
years has been the relatively enormous growth in the 
number of high schools and in the attendance at these 
schools. This has resulted in a corresponding in- 
crease in the number of teachers employed in second- 
ary education. These high school teachers are re- 
cruited at the present time not. mainly from the large _ 
universities with highly specialized courses in Educa- 
tion, but largely from the smaller colleges and the 
normal schools and teachers’ colleges. In most of 
these institutions there is no opportunity for a large 
number of courses dealing specifically with the prob- 
Jems of secondary education. In fact, in many of the 
colleges it is somewhat difficult for the institutions to 
offer courses which more than meet the North Central 
Association requirements or the professional require- 
ments of other similar organizations, or to meet the 
minimum amount of professional training required by 
the respective states for the legal certificate to teach. 
The question of the type of professional instruction 
to be given in such institutions is, therefore, a serious 
one. There seems to be a need for a course which 
deals in an elementary way with specific suggestions 
for the teaching of the various high school subjects. 
The great majority of our young people who go into

vi EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
secondary school work find that they must undertake 
to teach more than one subject. The high degree of 
specialization which is desired in the larger high 
schools is not infrequently absolutely impracticable in 
the small high schools. A textbook, therefore, which 
deals with the methods of teaching these various sub- 
jects in an elementary way should meet a very real 
need in Education. President Millis has had many 
contacts with secondary education, both in his capacity 
as president of a college and as an instructor in Edu- 
cation. During this time he has been face to face with 
the specific difficulties of these teachers. His presen- 
tation of the high school problem is one which cannot 
fail to be of great benefit to a large group of beginning 
high school teachers. It is primarily to meet the need 
of the normal schools and smaller colleges that this 
book has been prepared. It is also expected that a 
large number of teachers actually in the field of 
secondary education may find the suggestions in this 
volume stimulating and helpful.

PREFACE 
The aim of this volume is to supply teacher training 
institutions with a discussion of the high school prob- 
lem, suitable as a text in the general methods class for 
those students who are preparing specially for high 
school teaching, and also to supply teachers in service 
with a guide to further professional study. It is the 
outgrowth of some thirty years’ experience in super- 
vision of high school instruction and the training of 
secondary teachers. The effort has been to put in 
concise and intelligible form those concepts of objec- 
tive, principle, and method which this experience has 
shown to be the primary need of the young teacher. 
The content of the volume has been elaborated from 
notes of a course of lectures which have been delivered 
many times at Indiana University, and Wabash and 
Hanover Colleges. All of the devices and methods 
suggested have been tested out in actual school room 
practice. 
It is not the thought of the writers that the present 
treatise comprises all of the material necessary in the 
training of the secondary teacher. The book is meant 
to be introductory to the more special courses in 
method which will be required. It is their thought 
that all teachers should have a general introductory 
course covering the entire field of high school in- 
struction. There are three reasons for this view. 
vil

  viii PREFACE 
First, the majority of secondary teachers are em- 
ployed in the smaller schools. In these smaller 
schools, serving the majority of the population, the 
instructors are called on to teach in two or three, and 
even more, departments. They need preparation for 
this contingency. The generally prevailing practice 
of training schools to concentrate effort on the making 
of specialists is the source of serious weakness in the 
small schools. The second reason is that possibly 
more than half of the high school teachers, especially 
in the Middle West, at some time during their teaching 
career serve in administrative capacities, and should 
have the broad general outlook upon the high school 
problem in order rightly to relate the various factors 
in the situation. Third, the departmental teacher 
needs this same command of the whole field of the 
secondary school in order rightly to comprehend and 
relate her own particular field. To follow this general 
introductory course with the usual special methods 
courses will add greatly to the efficiency of high school 
administration and instruction. 
The point of view of the book is that first promul- 
gated by Stanley Hall, viz., that the training of the 
adolescent is at the same time the most difficult and, 
educationally and socially, the most significant part 
of the entire educational effort. The rise of the 
American high school is the outstanding fact of our 
later educational history. It is the most typically 
American of all of our schools. The quality of the 
work which it does is of the utmost importance to 
the welfare of our institutions. It has in its keeping 
the direction of the individual in the most critical period 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
of his development. The social importance of second- 
ary education and the psychological problems with 
which it must deal, combine to make the high school 
problem the most urgent issue of educational thought. 
The discussion also proceeds from the notion that 
high school education should be thoroughly demo- 
cratic. Its first fruit should be those qualities of mind 
and heart which constitute the essential elements in 
good citizenship. The high school should be so organ- 
ized and administered that its pupils may secure a 
truly democratic experience, involving practice in 
self-direction, intelligent insights into the functions 
and values of social institutions, and training in inde- 
pendent thinking and wise choosing. Much should be 
made of appreciation as distinguished from mere 
scholarship, and constant effort put forth to develop 
in the pupil those attitudes which will start him out 
upon proper levels of conduct and in right directions. 
The writers realize that the treatment of no topic 
is exhaustive. They are content rather to state the 
problems and suggest the lines of thought which have 
been found profitable. If they have succeeded in ac- 
complishing this they feel amply rewarded for their 
effort.

THE TEACHING OF 
HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
CHAPTER I 
FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 
The administration of secondary schools and the 
methods of teaching high school subjects properly in- 
volve the consideration of four factors in the high 
school situation. 
I. The functions of the high school as a social insti- 
tution. 
I. The educational values implicit in the materials 
of instruction. 
III. The mental processes involved in the study of 
: these subjects. 
IV. The methods which must be employed in order to 
realize desired values, as determined by the 
mental processes, together with the devices and 
equipment available. 
I. Social Functions 
The twofold origin of the high school—The high 
school is rooted on the one hand in the college prepar- 
atory school which sometimes was maintained in con- 
nection with the college, sometimes as an independent 
3
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
school, but administered primarily if not solely for the 
purpose of fitting the pupil for college entrance. On 
the other hand the high school has developed out of 
the elementary school, thus completing the task which 
year by year grew too large for the common school. 
In some communities this secondary school took the 
form of an independent seminary or academy, private 
or public, whose purpose was to give the higher train- 
ing which the growing community demanded. Quite 
generally the new institution grew out of the prolonga- 
tion of the common school. First one or two addi- 
tional years of instruction were provided; later a third 
and fourth, in order to afford time for newer branches 
of learning which the people came to feel were neces- 
sary for the adequate training of the youth. 
Finishing versus fitting school—The preparatory 
school was admittedly a fitting school; the academy or 
seminary a finishing school. The former concentrated 
on those subjects prescribed for admission to college, 
and omitted from its program many studies of value 
to the youth in view of the fact that he would have the 
opportunity to pursue them in subsequent years. The 
finishing school naturally attempted a more extensive 
and frequently ambitious program because of the 
desire to bring to bear upon the pupil during the 
secondary period all lines of training essential to his 
adequate preparation for citizenship. The prepara- 
tory school was more concerned with mental discipline 
and looked rather to the ultimate values to be secured 
in college study. These the intensive training of the 
‘fitting school made possible. On the other hand the 
finishing school was more concerned with immediate
-P-A-G-E-23
  FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 5 
values in the form of a wide but necessarily superficial 
culture and that training which would be immediately 
helpful in the practical life of the pupil. 
Conflicting functions of modern high school—The 
combination of these two types into the modern high 
school has presented to the administrator an exceed- 
ingly difficult problem—the management of an institu- 
tion having two functions to perform, in all respects 
conflicting and in some mutually exclusive. The public 
demands of the high school that at the same moment, 
and generally in the same classroom, it shall serve two 
classes of students; the small number who are prepar- 
ing for college, and the larger number who expect to 
end their formal education with the completion of their 
present course of study. In the larger schools these 
conflicting interests are met by the provision of par- 
allel courses of which the pupil is granted his choice, 
but even in these the differentiation is often more 
apparent than real. For many years in the smaller 
schools the interest of the college preparatory group 
was given the preference, leading at last to a vigorous 
reaction which in too many instances has resulted in 
the sacrifice of the minority. In the effort to secure 
justice to the ninety-eight per cent who do not expect 
to attend college the welfare of the two per cent who 
will go on to the higher schools is jeopardized, and in 
many cases the standard of the college lowered because 
of the inadequate preparation of the high school pro- 
duct. This is particularly true in the older subjects of 
mathematics, English and foreign language. 
Types of pupils to be served—Clearly it is unfair to 
neglect the interest of the majority of the high school 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  6 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
pupils in order to send on the few well prepared for 
college entrance. And as clearly it is unfair to sacri- 
fice this ambitious and promising minority in order to 
conserve the welfare of the majority. The safeguard- 
ing of both classes of students is the problem. And it 
is not solved by the recent assumption that ‘‘prepara- 
tion for life is a satisfactory preparation for college.’’ 
The results have not justified this assumption. There 
is a real diversity of interest which can not properly 
be ignored. In a democratic society it is imperative 
that the masses have the fullest possible introduction 
to the culture of the race,—its history, its literature, 
and its art. But it is equally imperative that there 
be a highly trained leadership. To neglect the culture 
of the masses results in tyranny; but to neglect the 
development of a highly trained leadership is to invite 
anarchy. To emphasize either type of education to 
the detriment of the other would be suicidal. Hence 
the high school must continue to perform both func- 
tions if it is to contribute to the maintenance of a real, 
dynamic American democracy. 
Provision for the gifted few—If we are to have a 
real democracy, the gifted few must have the oppor- 
tunity and be encouraged to press on for the higher 
training which will enable them to render that expert 
service which a dynamic society must have. While the 
prosperity and stability of the social order rests upon 
the general intelligence of the masses, the streams of 
progress have their origin in remote mountain springs 
of sound special scholarship. To deprive a state of 
its scholars, its great artists, its poets, its inventors, 
its experts on the picket line of research, is to invite 
 
-P-A-G-E-25

certain disaster. The story of human progress is the 
story of Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Darwin, Faraday, 
Helmholtz, the story of the philosophers and poets, of 
the naturalists and economists, the mathematicians 
and historians, of the great scholars and artists who 
blazed out the way for the common man. The nation 
which most encourages high scholarship becomes the 
leader among nations. The people who through a mis- 
taken conception of democracy strive to keep all 
persons down to the level of the ‘‘greater number’’ 
cut the connection with the nerve center of rational 
initiative. They are like a crew without a captain. 
This is a principle well understood by all successful 
nation builders. They lay strong and deep the foun- 
dations of their colleges and universities. To this 
principle democracies as well as empires must con- 
form. 
Training for leadership—Further, a stable democ- 
racy must have a safe leadership. The outstanding 
lessons of the Great War are two; first, that pure 
scholarship, great learning, the results of scientific 
research, are the most priceless possessions of a 
people; second, that the fate of a nation is determined 
by the quality of its leadership. Adequate leadership, 
if anything, is more essential in a democracy than in 
other forms of society. The common man is the ready 
prey of half-truths, illusions, and falsehoods. His 
judgment is not critical; he does not possess the requi- 
site scholarship for a proper conception of situations. 
He thus is in constant danger of a social stampede. 
The common man is disposed to accept without ques- 
tion the suggestion of rumor and newspaper report.

Because of this childlike trait of mind he is the easy 
victim of the propagandist. He is merely one of the 
latter’s public, ready to accept as true any statement 
made with sufficient vigor and the show of earnestness. 
On the other hand the ignorant man lacks the scholar- 
ship necessary for a critical reaction. He can not 
combat ideas without an adequate equipment of fact. 
He can not evaluate men or measures without proper 
knowledge of other men and measures. Lacking this 
scholarship and the critical habit of mind, he is help- 
less before the onrush of panic and craze except for 
the presence in the group of individuals of superior in- 
telligence and training. A public is much like a beach 
whose shore-line is protected by great piles driven into 
the sands at frequent intervals to break the force of 
onrushing waves. The superior individual is a break- 
water upon whom the waves of unwarranted public 
enthusiasm, baseless panics, class passions, fads 
and crazes, are lashed to pieces and the damage they 
would do forestalled. He is the protector of the peo- 
ple from their own folly, as well as their leader. The 
welfare of the group requires that it shall have within 
it at least a number of individuals who possess not 
only this superior ability, but also the power to 
radiate their judgment and will throughout the group. 
But for the restraining and guiding influence of such 
superior individuals the democratic group would 
speedily degenerate into an aimless mob. William 
Lowe Bryan has defined democracy as that form 
of society which opens an unobstructed path before 
each boy and girl in the commonwealth, leading up to 
the highest attainments of man at his best, and upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-27

which the youth shall be encouraged to travel to the 
limit of his capabilities. Any policy of school adminis- 
tration which obstructs this pathway is undemocratic. 
Any policy which discourages or prevents the fullest 
realization of the most gifted pupils is ultimately dis- 
astrous to the community. 
Training for general intelligence—But the necessity 
of providing for the minority must not obscure the 
equal necessity of provision for the adequate training 
of the many who will end their educational career with 
the high school. The scope of training required for 
the satisfactory equipment of the masses is increasing 
year by year. Much that was once considered as orna- 
mental and the prerogative of the privileged few is now 
commonplace in the life of the majority. Sixty years 
ago the voter who could discern the right and wrong 
of human slavery was adequately equipped to cast an 
intelligent ballot. In our day voters in presidential 
elections are asked to express judgment on systems 
of taxation, the government of foreign colonies, poli- 
cies of fiscal administration, the management of public 
utilities, international relations and numerous other 
political and economic problems, which to be an intelli- 
gent judgment requires a knowledge of history, eco- 
nomics, and political science wholly confined a few 
years ago to the college professor. If the ballot of 
the present and future is to be as intelligent as the 
ballot of 1860, the school must bring to the masses a 
scholarship unknown to the average citizen two gen- 
erations ago. The development of farm machinery 
makes the elements of physics and chemistry a com- 
monplace necessity to the farm boy. The new food
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and clothing problems make the training in the domes- 
tic arts formerly given in the home-wholly inadequate. 
To understand the advice of the family physician re- 
quires a knowledge of the principles of biology and 
sanitary science which were not discovered in the days 
of our grandfathers. In order to enjoy fully the 
means of entertainment and the social intercourse of 
the present day requires a knowledge of art, music and 
literature far beyond the requirements of former 
years. This means that we must offer a vastly en- 
riched source of study, and that the high school cur- 
riculum must continue to expand. The community 
which fails to make such provision for increasing cul- 
ture of all the youth must speedily fall out of step with 
the times. 
Reorganization of secondary education—The most 
prominent social movement of the last two decades is 
the effort to democratize the high school. The move- 
ment has involved considerable experimentation with 
various plans of organization, curriculum, and class- 
room methods. This experimentation has developed 
a number of aspects which promise to be permanent 
additions to the secondary program and a re-thinking 
of the entire problem involved which is already pro- 
ductive of larger insights and a more vitalizing con- 
ception. The most significant of these new concep- 
tions is that the high school must bring to each pupil, 
whatever his social or economic or mental status, the 
opportunity to engage in those lines of study and par- 
ticipate in those varieties of experience which will con- 
tribute to the fullest realization of his capacities for 
wholesome, happy and useful living. The point of
-P-A-G-E-29
  
FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 11 
view involved is that the high school is the highway 
along which all the youth may travel, each at his own 
gait, and each going as far as his own abilities and 
social situation may determine. Some, blessed with 
fine abilities, will travel this highway on up and 
through college and university out upon the higher and 
broader fields of activity. Others less favored by na- 
ture will leave at the end of the highway for the middle 
ground levels of life; while very many others of limited 
ability will take to the side roads after one or two or 
three years. It is the duty of the high school to make 
provision for each of these types, and such provision 
that the individual shall find it easier to live the life 
into which he settles, to be truly useful, and to be a 
better man in and of himself for the time he spent in 
school. This responsibility of the secondary school is 
expressed thus in the language of ‘‘The Commission 
on Secondary Edueation’’: ‘‘The school should admit 
and provide suitable instruction for all pupils who are 
in any respect so mature that they would derive more 
benefit from the secondary school than from the ele- 
mentary school.’’ 
Another conception developed in this re-thinking of 
the secondary school problem, which possibly is equally 
vital, is that in addition to imparting a body of infor- 
mation and training pupils in certain skills, the sec- 
ondary school is responsible for giving its pupils those 
emotional experiences which result in proper apprecia- 
tion and attitudes on the part of the individual toward 
his own life as well as toward the persons, institutions 
and things which constitute his environment. It is one 
thing to possess knowledge and skill; it is quite  
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  12 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
another to know when and for what to use them. The 
school must not only become democratic, but it must 
go far enough in its reorganization to make its pro- 
duct ‘‘safe for democracy.’’ 
It is not the purpose of this book to go into the ques- 
tion of curriculum making farther than to discuss the 
principles which must be observed. The matter at 
present is, with regard to many details, in an experi- 
mental stage. It is to be hoped that experimentation 
may be continued long enough to get a true precipitate. 
Some general principles, however, are clearly estab- 
lished. First of these is the principle of organization 
which underlies what is known as the ‘‘six-three-three 
plan,’’ involving the conception that the public school 
system covers three cycles of education; the elemen- 
tary, the intermediate and the secondary. The plan 
holds that these cycles differ sharply as to their physi- 
eal, mental and social factors, so much so as to require 
separate units of administration. The second and 
third cycles are assigned to the junior and senior high 
schools. The democratization of secondary education 
is quite largely accomplished by this extension of the 
field to include the seventh to twelfth years, by its divi- 
sion between the junior and senior high schools as sep- 
arate units, and by the organization of the interme- 
diate cycle of instruction and experience as included 
in the program of the junior high school. 
The organization of the junior high school as a 
separate administrative unit greatly simplifies the 
problem of the senior high school. The student body 
will be more mature and of better grade of ability. 
Much of the general training of pupils will have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 13 
accomplished. The senior high school may therefore 
organize its curriculum with greater definiteness. 
There is general agreement that its program must sat- 
isfy the following requirements: 
1. It will provide, so far as the resources of. the 
school permit, continuous courses in each of the de- 
partments of learning: English, Foreign Language, 
Mathematics, Natural Science, Social Science; and also 
in Health, Guidance, Practical and Fine Arts. 
2. The academic courses will be definitely special- 
ized. 
3. The practical arts will be definitely vocational. 
4. The fine arts courses will be organized to serve 
two classes of pupils. For one class they will be 
specialized with the development of skill as the end in 
view; for the majority they will be presented with the 
aim to cultivate appreciation. 
5. The program of studies will be organized as a 
unified curriculum in which a small number of con- 
stants are prescribed, other subjects being optional 
with a loose grouping corresponding to the three men- 
tal types of pupils, the intellectual, the artistic, and 
the practical. 
6. The program of the individual pupil will be or- 
ganized in view of his mental type, his ability, health, 
and all other factors which enter into his personal sit- 
uation, to the end that the school shall serve him while 
he remains a member of it in the way which for him is 
the best possible. 
7. In sectioning classes as well as making out indi- 
vidual programs assignments are to be made on the 
basis of mental ability, and the organization and pre-
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
sentation of instruction in a particular class adjusted 
to the standard of intelligence in the class. 
8. It is the duty of the school to provide opportunity 
to those pupils who are forced to take employment to 
continue their study in continuation classes to the end 
of the programs upon which they have entered. 
9. In the senior high school guidance will be more 
concerned with the individual’s career and his larger 
social relationships. 
10. All activities of the school shall be directed to 
the cultivation of ‘‘social mindedness.’’ 
The objectives in secondary education—The Commis- 
sion on Reorganization has formulated the aims of 
secondary education as follows: ‘‘The Commission 
has selected seven objectives which it holds should de- 
termine the organization, administration, and super- 
vision of the school, the subjects to be taught, the 
methods of instruction and the extra-classroom activi- 
ties. Their objectives are: (1) health, (2) command 
of fundamental processes, (3) worthy home member- 
ship, (4) vocation, (5) citizenship, (6) worthy use of 
leisure, (7) ethical character.’’ This formula is 
adopted as stating the content of the school product 
which the high school will strive to secure. 
II. Psychological Aspects 
Becoming an individual—We have considered the 
functions of the high school thus far with reference to 
its historical and social aspects. There are also psy- 
chological aspects. During the secondary school per- 
iod the pupil is passing through certain psychological
-P-A-G-E-33
  FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 15 
changes which largely determine methods of instruc- 
tion. He is in a stage of transition from childhood to 
manhood. He is neither child nor adult and yet partly 
both. As a child he was under the control of objective 
authority; as a man he will be governed by his per- 
sonal insight and judgment. In the high school he is 
in transition from one status to the other—from objec- 
tive to subjective control, from government by author- 
ity to government by personal judgment, from depend- 
ence upon the opinions of others to thinking for him- 
self. He is becoming an individual. As a child his 
behavior was directed by rules of conduct imposed 
upon him from without; as a fully developed adult he 
will determine his behavior in the particular situation 
by the application of principles which he has personally 
adopted for his guidance. During his high school 
course he is changing from one state in the direction 
of the other. He has passed beyond the stage of sub- 
mission to authority but cannot walk alone. His heart 
cries out for the right of self-determination, but he 
has neither the ability nor the body of experience 
necessary for complete self-determination. He is in 
the process of becoming an independent being. 
Becoming a rational being—In the second place his 
mind is shifting its dominant interest from particulars 
to generals, from individual facts to laws and prin- 
ciples. He is less and less concerned about men as 
individuals and more interested in them as types. It 
is a time for generalizations of experience, for the 
elaboration of principles governing action, for state- 
ments of rules governing processes, for definition of 
standards of judgment. In childhood the mental
-P-A-G-E-34
    16 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
processes are directed primarily toward the gathering 
of a treasury of fact. The adolescent mind is pri- 
marily directed toward the organization of this mater- 
ial into a system of general ideas, and laws and prin- 
ciples which may serve as the premises of rational 
thought. That is, the youth is in the process of be- 
coming a rational being. 
Becoming socialized—Third, the social impulses 
grow stronger. Paradoxically, while becoming indi- 
vidualized he at the same time is becoming socialized. 
He is more and more individualized in his thinking, 
but more and more disposed to group action. If he 
seems diffident it is because his yearning for group 
relations has not been satisfied. It is in this period 
that he is most disposed to unite with the church, to 
join a fraternity, to align himself with a political party, 
to become definitely identified with a social set. He is 
in the process of becoming a socialized being. 
Becoming a person—Youth is the time of the dawn- 
ing of personality—the age in which the boy and girl 
adopt those aims, standards and principles of life that 
will constitute the warp of the fabric which their re- 
maining years are spent in weaving. The time of 
seeing visions and dreaming dreams, of program 
making, of establishing relationships, of adopting the 
scale of values by which the youth is guided in his 
choices and by which his deeds are measured, of fitting 
his spiritual eyes with the lenses which shall determine 
his future perspectives—it is a pivotal period in the 
life of the boy and since it is pivotal, exceedingly 
significant and difficult. 
The function of guidance—These psychological ten-   
     
-P-A-G-E-35
  
FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 7 
dencies of youth lay upon the high school as its pri- 
mary function the guidance of the pupil in his transi- 
tion from childhood toward independent personality. 
The school must make sure that he grows into true and 
wholesome insights, that he arrives at valid principles, 
that he comes into healthy adjustments, that he adopts 
a true scale of values. In large measure this guidance 
should be given in personal conference by a specialist 
and through the management of student activities, 
which properly take a prominent place in the school 
program. But even in as large measure, possibly 
larger, it must come indirectly through a wise en- 
couragement of wholesome mental attitudes in class- 
room instruction. After all, the highest use of studies 
is to furnish the nutriment which is transmuted into 
personality, and the first demand of method is that it 
shall promote a proper growth of the pupil in his 
approach to maturity. It must be adjusted to the 
mental age of the pupil, and conform to the deeper 
psychological movements within him. This requires 
that the teacher shall recognize that he is dealing with 
neither child nor man, but with the child becoming 
a man. She must carefully avoid ‘‘over-shooting’’ 
the younger classes and ‘‘under-shooting’’ the upper 
grades. That government of the high school will be 
most efficient which allows considerable personal free- 
dom under a patient but firm restraint. The ideal 
school would seem to be a ‘‘limited democracy,’’ a 
flexible organization permitting and encouraging pupil 
initiative and group control under the guidance of a 
well-gloved, vigorous authority. If the school is large 
enough to measure out freedom from restraint of 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
authority in proportion to the maturity of the pupils, 
so much the better. 
Value of group activity—There is great value in 
properly directed organizations because of their exer- 
cise of group action. The high school boy learns no 
more valuable lesson for life than to do his bit in play 
in perfect co-ordination with his team-mates. The self- 
restraint which he gladly imposes, the whipping him- 
self to the utmost exertion for the honor of the school, 
his hearty co-operation with his fellows, playing the 
game fair and hard, are the roots from which grow the 
elements of splendid citizenship. The debating 
society, the dramatic club, the band, the orchestra, the 
school paper and similar organizations, offer invalu- 
able training of the youth in social adjustments. 
Properly they should be recognized as means of de- 
velopment of personality rather than as modes of 
recreation. 
Group activity in the classroom—The growing social- 
ity of the pupil requires that group activity shall be in- 
troduced into the class work as fully as possible. The 
most effective stimulations of mental activity always 
are those arising out of social situations. With the 
child these situations involve mostly the relations of 
pupil and teacher, but with the youth and adult they 
comprise the relations of the individual and his group. 
The vigorous stimulations of class debate, of com- 
mittee action, of a class program in which the teacher 
is referee rather than dictator, are pertinent illustra- 
tions. In the presentation of history and literature, 
particularly, the ethical implications properly should 
be stressed, taking care not to impose upon the pupil
-P-A-G-E-37
FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 19 
the notion of teacher or text so much as to awaken 
in him a line of thought which will lead to a personal 
conviction. It is not extravagant to say that no lesson 
whose content bears upon human life should stop short 
of a personal conviction on the part of the learner. 
Knowledge is for behavior. The adolescent is trying 
to find himself in the institutional relationships in 
which he must live. Hach lesson should contribute 
somewhat to the solution of his problem. 
Emphasis of generalization—The tendency to seek 
for the general principles involved rather than to rest 
with the mere acquisition of facts indicates another 
essential element in high school method, the emphasis 
of generalization, the pushing of the examination of 
facts through to an insight into the principles involved 
in these individual cases. The temper of the high 
school student makes it advisable that he approach any 
subject with the attitude of the investigator rather 
than as a mere learner of other men’s ideas. In order 
to acquire habits of systematic thinking he should be 
set to work on real problems in which he must analyze 
the situation for himself, find the necessary data, sift 
the evidence, and arrive at his own conclusions. Such 
activity his nature craves. 
The psychological function of the high school re- 
quires first, that the government of the pupils shall 
provide for as large a measure of personal freedom 
and individual initiative as possible within the limits 
of orderly -procedure; second, that the work of the 
school be organized in the form of group activity; 
third, that student conduct be secured by appeal to 
principle rather than by demanding obedience to con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  20 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
stituted authority; fourth, that the stress of instruc- 
tion be placed on generalization from the mass of facts 
presented; fifth, that instruction and school life be 
directed toward the development of personality, that 
is, toward a proper scale of values and wholesome 
ambitions as well as a wholesome emotional experience. 
III. Pedagogical Aspects 
Knowledge of educational values necessary—Peda- 
gogically, it is the business of the high school to help 
the pupil to realize the educational values resident in 
the several studies which by common consent consti- 
tute the secondary school curriculum. A proper 
understanding of these values is so essential to the 
determination of methods of teaching that a detailed 
analysis is necessary. The intelligent workman 
wants to know first of all what he can accomplish with 
his tools in order to know how to use them. Studies 
are not ends in themselves but tools with which to 
accomplish certain results in and with the pupils. 
Clearly no teacher is in position to plan her instruc- 
tion until she possesses an adequate conception of the 
results she should obtain by means of such instruc- 
tion. Much of our school work gets nowhere because 
it has no definite objective. Likewise much of educa- 
tional criticism is futile for want of a definite standard 
for comparison. For these reasons considerable 
space is given in the following chapters: to the con- 
sideration of educational values, first in general; 
second as involved in the several high school studies.
-P-A-G-E-39

IV. Summary 
The study of the principles of administration of 
secondary schools and of secondary instruction, in- 
volves the consideration of four factors in the high 
school situation: (1) the objectives in secondary edu- 
cation, (2) educational values of the subject matter 
utilized, (3) the mental process employed in the use 
of such material, and (4) the organization and methods 
necessary to the achievement of the objectives of the 
high school. 
Historically the public high school grew out of the 
college preparatory school and the seminary, or acad- 
emy, inheriting their major functions: preparation 
of the few for admission to college or professional 
school, and the training of the many for practical life. 
The modern secondary school is under equal social 
obligation with reference to both of these functions. 
Democracy can not exist without a trained leadership 
supported by an intelligent populace. The high school 
should serve, therefore, to direct all pupils giving 
evidence of capacity for scholarship and professional 
usefulness to the college, providing them with the 
specialized training which affords the most advantage- 
ous introduction to the college cycle of education. At 
the same time the pupils who are to go immediately 
into their vocations should receive the instruction and 
training that will make them socially most useful in 
the walks of life they elect. 
The large increase of attendance in our high schools, 
together with the consequent introduction of an in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
22 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
creasing proportion of pupils of the non-academic 
type, and certain social changes that place new 
responsibilities on the high school, have made neces- 
sary the entire reorganization of secondary education. 
This enormous task has been under way for many 
years, and is yet far from complete. 
The principal features of the accepted plan for re- 
organization are: (1) The conception of the work of 
the seventh, eighth and ninth years as constituting a 
distinct educational cycle which should be assigned 
to the junior high school to be administered as a unit 
of the system, and of the work of the remaining three 
years of the secondary period as constituting another 
and inherently different type of work; (2) The func- 
tions of the junior high school are to make the transi- 
tion between the elementary grades and the senior 
high school by completing the former and introducing 
the latter, at the same time giving to those pupils 
who leave school during this period that instruction 
and training which will be socially most useful; (3) 
The senior high school is to provide a program organ- 
ized as a unified curriculum in which a small number of 
constants are prescribed, other subjects being optional 
with a loose grouping corresponding to the three 
mental types, the intellectual, the artistic, the practical ; 
(4) Academic courses are definitely specialized, the 
practical arts definitely vocational, and the fine arts 
presented for appreciation of values as well as for 
skill; (5) The school will serve the individual pupil 
while he remains a member of it in the way which for 
him, all things considered, is the best possible. 
The objectives in secondary education as stated by  
-P-A-G-E-41
  
FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 23 
the Commission on Reorganization are: (1) health, 
(2) command of fundamental processes, (3) worthy 
home membership, (4) vocation, (5) citizenship, (6) 
worthy use of leisure, (7) ethical character. 
The period of secondary education is a time of tran- 
sition in the life of the pupil, in which he is passing 
from a state of dependence upon others for control 
to a state of self-determination, in which his mind 
tends toward generalizations, in which he is becoming 
socialized, and a time of the dawning of personality. 
Guidance must take cognizance of this state of tran- 
sition. 
Group activity is particularly valuable in these 
early adolescent years, not only as the means to the 
fullest activity of the pupil, but also as preventive of 
the morbidness with which youth is sometimes afflicted. 
Group activity should be introduced into the class- 
room as largely as possible. ' 
No lesson whose content bears upon human life 
should stop short of a conviction on the part of the 
learner. 
The temper of the high school student makes it 
advisable that he approach any subject with the atti- 
tude of the investigator rather than as a mere learner 
of other men’s ideas.

CHAPTER II 
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 
I. A General Consideration 
Traditional views—By the educational value of a 
study we mean the contributions which that study may 
make to the life of the learner. Thus it may give him 
a skill which he will employ in gaining a living; a body 
of knowledge necessary as a prerequisite to the suc- 
cessful pursuit of a higher branch of learning; an 
emotional experience which will enrich his life; a social 
insight which may modify his subsequent attitude 
toward society; a method of thought; a valuable life 
habit; or it may open up to him a conception which 
will revolutionize his personality. The traditional 
view conceives of studies as offering two contributions, 
knowledge and skill. The teacher commonly supposes 
the former to be the main if not the sole value of the 
study. It may be, too, in these days of over-emphasis 
of the so-called utilitarian subjects that greater stress 
should be placed upon the fact that all knowledge is 
valuable. The dictum of Herbert Spencer in his 
“‘Hissays on Education’’ has led many far afield with 
the theory that some branches of knowledge are more 
useful than others. The difficulty in estimating the 
relative importance of studies lies in the tendency to 
26
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES 27 
take a view of human life at once too narrow and too 
short. The thought of our day is afflicted with an 
educational myopia. The leaders as well as the public 
are too blinded by the immediate application of studies 
to appreciate properly those ultimate uses which over 
a long period may prove of infinitely greater signifi- 
cance. To prepare a boy for the demands of twenty- 
one is a simpler task than to fit him for the whole of 
his life. And to reach through him to his grand- 
children, to build a nation, may give far greater 
significance to some facts than the prevailing feverish 
view reveals. Besides, the ultimate.end of man is so 
uncertain that our problem is complicated by the neces- 
sity of going back to the creeds of religion for a start- 
ing point. 
Danger of faulty perspective—Our judgment of the 
relative importance of studies is also impaired by our 
prevailing faulty perspective. One set of philosophers 
build their educational theory on the assumption that 
man is essentially and predominantly an economic 
being. Another sets out with the assumption that he 
is chiefly a biological creature. Still another con- 
ceives of him as primarily a religious, or an esthetic, 
or a political, or a philosophizing person. Like the 
blind men who went to see the elephant, they get a 
grossly false perspective from the one-sidedness of 
their contact. It frequently occurs that the leader is 
swept from his feet by the zeal of propaganda and 
takes even less than a onesided view, as illustrated in 
the conception of some leaders in vocational education 
that economic betterment is wholly a question of im- 
proved production, forgetting that distribution and 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
consumption are equally important if not more signifi- 
cant factors in the economic situation. 
Man a creature of many wants—Man is a seven-phase 
creature. He has seven sides to his nature which must 
be fed. He has a biological nature, but also a spiritual 
and ethical nature. He is a political being, an intel- 
lectual being, a social being, a property-getting being, 
and a pleasure-seeking person. He is all of these at 
once. He touches life at all angles all of the time. 
Every kind of knowledge is necessary to him. It is 
contestable whether, in the long run, one kind is more 
essential for him than another. His life depends upon 
the adjustments he is able to make in these several 
directions. For proper adjustments he is dependent 
upon the fullest and most accurate scholarship. 
All knowledge useful—The only possible generaliza- 
tion from human experience is that each element of 
knowledge is useful at some time, and in some con- 
nection. In the exigencies of life every species of 
knowledge at some time becomes of vital consequence. 
Every fact is useful; to know it is a necessity in the 
complete life of man. It is impious to suppose that 
God created a useless fact, and that there is any body 
of truth, large or small, which is not humanly neces- 
sary. There is need of restoration of public regard 
for the truth—truth for its own sake, truth as a 
savings-account against the day of necessity. Society 
can not afford to have any body of knowledge, whether 
immediately applicable or not, lost in the stream of 
culture. Therefore, what may be called the knowledge 
value of studies is universal and paramount. On the 
whole and in the long run everything is worth teaching.
-P-A-G-E-47
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 29 
The evidence of history—‘‘ The history of the amelio. 
ration of human life gives conclusive proof of the prin- 
ciple that pure scholarship as distinguished from ap- 
plied science is the source of progress; and democracy 
without progress is unthinkable. The developments 
in medicine, in surgery, in sanitation, in social organi- 
zation, in machinery, have been secured as by-products 
of the labor of our scholars. The scientist patiently 
searching out the undiscovered is the pioneer blazing 
the trails of the new country in which every man may 
more nearly rise to his full estate. In the second 
place, the assumption that some knowledge is useful 
while some is not, is false. There is no useless knowl- 
edge. God never made a useless fact. Much is not 
immediately applicable, so far as we can see, but some- 
time, somewhere, the least significant of God’s facts 
will prove indispensable to human welfare. The world 
is made so. Throughout history the penny-wise have 
been pound-foolish in their condemnation of.what they 
called useless learning, only to discover later that these 
same things were the most useful. The irregular stone 
east into the rubbish of the temple proves to be the 
keystone of the arch which must support the weight 
of the structure. Repeatedly workmen in their haste 
have thrown Greek roots, Latin verbs and the Aristo- 
telian logic into the rubbish heap, but always in the 
end they have had to dig them out to complete the 
structure. In the economy of God’s world everything 
has its place. There are no useless things. In the 
completed structure each fact is indispensable. This 
does not argue the unwisdom of utilitarian training 
emphasized in the schools to-day, but the fallacy of 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    
  30 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
depreciating the disinterested scholarship of the 
classicist and scientist, which suspends the weight of 
the utilities. It argues the indispensable value to a 
free and progressive people of just those things in 
higher education which they are prone to condemn as 
useless.’’* 
Values classified—The first right of the pupil is that 
he receive from the study a compact, thoroughly 
digested, and organized body of knowledge. But 
further analysis discloses other values to which the 
pupil has equal right. These may be grouped into 
three classes: 
Instrumental Values. 
Cultural Values. 
Disciplinary Values. 
II. Instrumental Values 
Defined and classified—By Instrumental Values is 
meant those contributions of the subject that serve as 
the tools or instruments which the individual employs 
in other activities. These values may arise either 
from the kind of knowledge conveyed or from 
the species of skill developed in the study which 
may be employed in successfully performing the func- 
tions of life or in coping with personal or social prob- 
lems. For convenience of analysis the Instrumental 
Values may be considered as of six kinds: Prepara- 
tory and Introductory, Vocational, Ethical, Socializ- 
ing, Conventional, and Health. ‘ 
Preparatory and Introductory Values—A study has 
1Commencement Address, Hanover College, 1920,
-P-A-G-E-49
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 31 
preparatory value when it is prerequisite to another 
study. Arithmetic is preparatory to algebra; reading 
is preparatory to all studies. Among high school 
studies this relation is not so marked, but algebra and 
geometry are necessary to the successful study of 
physics; physics and chemistry are necessary to the 
intelligent study of biology; history and literature are 
mutually dependent. A subject has introductory value 
if it presents the elements of another subject which ex- 
tends this content and develops it in greater detail. 
General history thus introduces the more specialized 
history of periods and nations. Physical Geography 
prepares the way for geology by presenting the same 
field of knowledge in an elementary way. Latin is 
introductory to English grammar and vocabulary 
study, and to the Romance languages. Preparatory 
and Introductory Values depend on the logical rela- 
tions of studies ; upon the transfer of identical elements 
of knowledge or processes. 
Vocational Values—The Vocational Value of a study 
is determined by its contribution to the equipment of 
the learner for earning his living, or for coping with 
the practical concerns of his life. Agriculture for the 
farm boy; home economics for the girl; physics for 
the individual who uses gas motors, electrical devices, 
machines, and mechanical devices of all kinds, and for 
the photographer, plumber, etc.; biology for all per- 
sons, likewise English; these are illustrations. Every 
subject has some degree of immediate utility, and to 
this extent is a vocational study. 
Ethical Values—Character is the product of the 
blending of intellectual, emotional, and volitional ele- 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
32 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ments. These comprise a set of standards of judg- 
ment, or principles of conduct, which are derived in 
part from a fundamental bias of mind, and in part 
from the generalizations of experience, either personal 
or appropriated from others through reading or social 
intercourse; a complex of feeling-tones which remain 
as a sort of residuum of the emotional experiences of 
the individual; and of habits and attitudes resulting 
from continued lines of conduct. Those studies which 
contribute to the first factor, standards of moral judg- 
ment, are credited with Ethical Value. History and 
literature are rich in such material. Elementary 
sociology, industrial history, the classics, and biology 
also offer abundant contributions of this character. 
Socializing Values—The Socializing Value of a sub- 
ject is its service in giving those social insights and 
mental attitudes which fit the individual for useful citi- 
zenship. An understanding of the dependence of all 
kinds of people on the worker, of the conditions under 
which he toils, of his hopes and his failures, his prob- 
lems; an insight into what each class of people gives 
to the other classes, and in return what each receives 
from the others,—these will give a basis for intelligent 
judgment, and certainly arouse a sympathy which be- 
gets toleration, and these two together prepare the 
way for co-operation. The study of what our civiliza- 
tion costs in terms of toil, trouble and sacrifice opens 
the way to the conception and feeling of personal obli- 
gation which, joined with the Christian feeling of love, 
develops the attitude of service. Those studies which 
perform this function are socializing in their influence. 
History offers splendid material for this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-51
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES 33 
Some of the newer courses in civics, particularly those 
which lay stress on the factors and problems of com- 
munity life, are rich in this respect. Geography pre- 
sents many studies of great possibilities for this kind 
of training. Descriptive sociology, with some empha- 
sis on the significance of the several social institutions, © 
has the largest Socializing Value. 
Conventional Values—The’ preceding values are 
intrinsic, growing out of the content of studies. In 
addition to these is another depending on popular atti- 
tude or on what may be called standards of culture. 
We are familiar with the conventionalities of dress 
and social intercourse. There is a variety of free 
masonry which regulates the admission of the indi- 
vidual to the group by requiring his conformity to cer- 
tain standards of knowledge and behavior without re- 
gard primarily to the inherent value of these things. 
Social recognition, opportunity for employment, politi- 
cal preferment, and the like, are far more determined 
by these conventions than a democratic person pro- 
fesses to like. Here and there an individual may beat 
down the walls of conventionality and force his way 
to success, but the majority are not able to break with 
these requirements of respectability however arbitrary 
they may seem to be. The wise teacher recognizes 
this fact and contributes what he can to the prepara- 
tion of the novitiate by investing him with the neces- 
sary grips, signs, and passwords. Purity of English 
is a great asset wholly aside from its value as an ele- 
ment in sound thinking and general efficiency. It is 
accepted as the index of personal worth without regard 
to the real ability lying back of it. Good conversa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tional power, aptness in story-telling, facility in pub- 
lie speech, and—even in these days of democracy— 
classical scholarship, have a high degree of Conven- 
tional Value. Many studies which have lost favor for 
pedagogical reasons in recent years, retain their right 
to a place in the curriculum because society requires 
them for recognition. 
Health Values—Added to the foregoing Instrumental 
Values is the contribution which many studies make 
in the form of knowledge and practice necessary to 
the preservation of personal and public health. The 
principles of ventilation, house-heating, lighting and 
plumbing taught in physics are an example. Biology 
contains much necessary material; likewise physiol- 
ogy, dietetics, and psychology. 
III. Cultural Values 
Defined and classified—Many studies contribute 
richly to the development of those aspects of life which 
we comprise under the term personality. Moods, tem- 
peraments, attitudes toward life, force of character, 
go far to make up the desired educational product. 
They constitute the emotional factor which may with 
propriety be called the ‘‘heart of the man.’’ The con- 
tributions of studies in this direction have what we 
call Cultural Values. There are three varieties of 
this contribution: Sentimental Values, Liberalizing 
Values, and Reconstructive Value. 
Sentimental Values—These are realized in the form 
of that enrichment of soul and spiritual recreation 
arising as the by-product of emotional experiences.
-P-A-G-E-53
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 35 
Goethe says that we are shaped and fashioned by our 
loves, by what we admire and enjoy. The things a 
boy dreams over arouse pervading emotions that exert 
a far-reaching influence over his development. Haw- 
thorne has embodied this principle in splendid fashion 
in his story of ‘‘The Great Stone Face.’’ Lowell like- 
wise develops the effect of the emotional reaction. of 
passionate pursuit in ‘‘The Vision of the Holy Grail.’’ 
Dr. Holmes illustrates the principle effectively in the 
analogy of the meerschaum pipe. Just as the meer- 
schaum comes from the hand of the workman a charac- 
terless thing, but little by little is impregnated with 
essences of tobacco burned in it, becoming so saturated 
with the residuum that it comes to have definite color, 
taste and odor, so the boy’s soul becomes saturated with 
the essence of the emotional reactions of studies, asso- 
ciations, and activities. A little of all that he thinks, 
feels, and does remains as a residual deposit in him, 
as a part of him, adding to and modifying his spiritual 
nature. The music he enjoys, the fun he has, his pa- 
triotic impulses, the quality of his play, the tone of his 
conversation, the imagery aroused by his reading, his 
enthusiasms, his loves and his hates, the things he 
admires or rejects, are highly potential because they 
remain as abiding elements in the emotional factor of 
his personality. Some studies are rich in the stimula- 
tions of feeling which they afford. They are said to 
have Sentimental Values. This is secured through the 
degree and varieties of appreciation developed in the 
study. Appreciation is of three varieties: Intellec- 
tual, Austhetic, and Ethical. The first consists of ad- 
miration of successful performance of difficult mental
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
processes, of excellence of statement, and love of truth. 
It is secured by directing the attention of the pupil to 
the excellence of intellectual victories and stimulating 
in him an effort for the same sort of distinction in 
some field within the range of his ability. AUsthetic 
appreciation is love of the beautiful and is developed 
through long and intimate personal contact with na- 
ture and the various forms of art. Closely connected 
with esthetic appreciation is the sense of humor and 
the enjoyment of play. The quality of humor is a sig- 
nificant factor in personality, and the kind of sport 
which appeals to the individual is an index to his cul- 
ture. Ethical appreciation is the individual’s discrim- 
ination of the relative worth of men and measures and 
admiration for those which are inherently best. A 
distinguished philosopher has said that the ultimate 
function of the college is to train and equip the student 
to be a judge of men. To foster admiration of the 
right sort of men and women certainly is no small con- 
tribution to the making of personality. 
Liberalizing Values—Human freedom is a world-old 
theme of philosophers and poets. The former have 
endeavored to define it; the latter have sung its 
glories; warriors have fought for it as the most price- 
less heritage of man. We may distinguish two ele- 
ments of freedom as educationally considered: first, 
that facility and accuracy of behavior which is made 
possible through increase of skill and scholarship; sec- 
ond, that positiveness and facility of action which come 
of the consciousness of equality. Increase of knowl- 
edge of the social and physical environment pushes 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 37 
back the walls which cireumscribe the sphere of action 
and relationship. The farmer whose knowledge is 
limited to the geographic and economic conditions of 
his immediate locality is limited in his plans to such 
conditions. He plans his crop program in the light of 
those conditions only. But the man whose extensive 
knowledge of geography, industry, and political condi- 
tions puts him into personal contact with the whole 
world is set free—he may plan his crop program with 
reference to all the factors of the world situation, not 
only for the particular season but possibly for a term 
of years. The merchant of narrow scholarship is 
limited in the scope of his operations to the range of 
his knowledge. He can adjust himself time-wise and 
space-wise only to the narrow sphere with which he is 
acquainted. But his competitor possessing a broad 
and intimate acquaintance with the natural and trade 
resources, and the economic, political and social con- 
ditions of all the world, is able to work out a business 
policy in intelligent adjustment with all of those con- 
ditions, not only for this year but over a considerable 
period of time. The former is working in the dark; 
the latter works with full knowledge of all the factors 
in the trade situation—the former is fettered by his 
ignorance; the latter is set free by his knowledge. 
Likewise, increase of skill of any kind enlarges the 
scope of activity. The man who has learned to do 
something better than anyone else rises above compe- 
tition. The best surgeon is master of his situation, 
because he can choose the terms and conditions of his 
work as well as command employment. The man 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 ‘THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
equipped to seize the opportunity as it is presented is 
free compared to his unequipped brother. This va- 
riety of freedom means the ability of the individual to 
determine for himself the relationship into which he 
enters, that ability which makes possible a large 
measure of self-determination. Studies differ in the 
extent of their contributions to this sort of freedom. 
Many of them are rich in this service to the student. 
The sciences, history, geography, and the social 
sciences, obviously have this value in a high degree. 
The second element in freedom is the self-command, 
force, poise and certainty arising from the conscious- 
ness of equality with one’s associations and competi- 
tors, and from the consciousness of preparation for the 
situation. The sense of inferiority inhibits the flow of 
energy; impairs the functioning of mind and body; re- 
duces power. A sense of equality or of superiority 
releases all available power; sets free the latent 
energy. All kinds of scholarship and skill have this 
sort of value, particularly those which enlarge and 
perfect channels of communication, and which relate 
to human affairs. Whatever imparts to the student 
the knowledge and art possessed by the ablest men 
with whom he comes into contact will make him ‘‘at 
home’’ in the world of men and enable him to appear 
and work at his best. 
Reconstructive Values—A man’s life at any time is 
fairly well unified and its direction determined by what 
is called his point of view, his outlook upon the world, 
his philosophy of life. This organizing idea colors 
his interpretation of experiences, his judgment, and his
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES 39 
choices. It determines his scale of values and the ob- 
jectives toward which he strives. Within this larger 
unifying conception he has others relating particularly 
to his several institutional relationships. One idea 
governs his political thinking and conduct; another his 
religious character; another dominates his moral life; 
another his industrial relations, ete. These several 
organizing principles form the warp of his life fabric. 
At any particular time they are incomplete, but partial 
apprehensions of the truth, and possibly in part or 
wholly erroneous. They are modified by new experi- 
ence, sometimes completely revolutionized as in relig- 
ious conversion. A reconstruction of so much of one’s 
life as was governed by the old idea follows. The re- 
organization of thought and the life program produced 
by religious conversion is typical of the reconstruction 
which may follow from the apprehension of a new 
scientific principle, the reading of a book, the study of 
philosophy, or anthropology, or economics, or the per- 
sonal contacts of school life. The contributions of 
this kind which studies make to the pupil constitute 
their Reconstructive Value. All subjects make some 
such contribution and history, literature, science and 
vocational subjects are particularly rich in reorganiz- 
ing possibilities. 
IV. Disciplinary Values 
Defined and classified—By Disciplinary Values is 
meant the reactions of studies on the mental processes, 
attitudes and habits of pupils. It is generally con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ceded that in addition to the concepts in the various 
studies, which may be used in the pursuit of other 
studies, and which may also be employed in the solu- 
tion of the practical problems of life, there are certain 
disciplines realized that are of general application. 
These take the form of: Increase of Intellectual 
Power, Development of Mental Attitudes, and Forma- 
tion of Valuable Habits. 
Increase of intellectual power—It is reasonable to 
expect that the brain will respond to the same laws of 
growth which govern other bodily organs and that a 
vigorous course of study will entail such cerebral ac- 
tivity as will result in a maximum of cerebral develop- 
ment. To what extent this may occur is not deter- 
mined, but evidently in sufficiently large degree to 
warrant the popular belief that vigorous intellectual 
application is accompanied by ‘‘increase of brains.’’ 
Whatever may be the fact as to such physiological 
development, it is obvious that systematic study does 
establish definite mental processes and methods of at- 
tack. The logical handling of mathematical subjects 
tends to fix more definitely the analytic-synthetic move- 
ment as a method of attacking all problems. In the 
study of a foreign language the pupil becomes experi- 
enced in processes of substitution and organization 
that are identical with processes in industry, trade and 
the professions. The practice in contingent thinking 
in the study of history develops a type of judgment 
which the individual will employ in his approach to 
subsequent social problems. 
Habits of thought movement are as readily devel- 
oped as are habits in other types of behavior. Thus
-P-A-G-E-59
  
EDUCATIONAL VALUES 41 
the pupil may be equipped with a set of methods 
which he may employ advantageously not only in sub- 
sequent studies but in practical life as well. This is 
well illustrated in the practical utility of the methods 
of laboratory experimentation, methods of research, 
and of the carrying over of the discipline of the shop 
into practical judgment of the quality of the manu- 
factured product. 
There is also possibly an increase of the intelligence 
level of the individual through the wealth of the stimu- 
lation which some studies afford. It is not fully de- 
termined that mental calibre is entirely fixed and that 
the individual at a given age possesses a certain degree 
of intelligence regardless of his experience. It is sug- 
gested with some plausibility that a large element of 
mental deficiency is due to the absence of proper stim- 
ulation at the proper time. This suggests that a rich 
stimulation as mental functions ripen may result in a 
real increase of mental capacity. Certainly it would 
at least result in the fullest realization of potential 
limits. 
Development of mental attitudes—Such character- 
istics as responsiveness to suggestion, open-minded- 
ness, disinterestedness in research, judiciousness in 
weighing evidence, fairness, poise, and desire for 
truth, all of which are requisite in the well-trained 
thinker, obviously are largely a by-product of studies. 
Many subjects are rich in possibilities of this kind. 
The laboratory studies are especially so. History 
offers a splendid opportunity for the development of 
open-mindedness; literature should make any pupil 
judicious; all descriptive studies cultivate the love of
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
truth and reduce the personal equation. The careful 
teaching of any study should create the disposition to 
demand adequate proof. 
Formation of valuable habits—Properly directed 
study of any subject also develops such valuable life 
habits as industry, perseverance, painstaking neat- 
ness, veracity and honesty. While, strictly speaking, 
these habits are specialized, yet the ideals involved are 
so strong as to form definite tendencies which carry 
over into all activities. Experience goes to establish 
the fact that the habits of the school room quite gen- 
erally cling to the individual for life. Certainly this 
contribution of studies, or of the manner of handling 
them, and especially of the quality of application ex- 
acted of the student, is a most significant service of the 
school. 
V. Exercises 
1. Score the Educational Values potential in the sev- 
eral studies of the conventional high school curriculum 
when well taught, using the following form. The sev- 
eral values may be indicated by inserting in the ap- 
propriate squares, the words High, Medium, Low, and 
No as exponents of the values which the study is ad- 
judged to possess. It is assumed in such exercises 
that the subject is taught efficiently. As a matter of 
fact the value of the subject is in most cases condi- 
tioned by the quality of teaching. The question to be 
considered in the exercise is the values which may be 
realized by proper handling of the study.

VI. Summary 
In the consideration of educational values it is im- 
portant to avoid a narrow view of life. Man has seven 
sides to his nature which must be fed. He touches life 
at all angles all the time: every kind of knowledge is 
valuable. 
There is need of restoration of public regard for the 
truth—truth for its own sake, truth as a savings- 
account against the day of necessity. 
The first right of the pupil is that he receive from 
the study a compact, thoroughly digested, and organ- 
ized body of knowledge. 
Besides the Instrumental Values of studies, gen- 
erally recognized, there are certain Cultural and Dis- 
ciplinary Values which may be secured by the proper 
use of subject matter. There is obvious need of 
greater emphasis of these latter values. 
Instrumental Values comprise (1) Preparatory, (2) 
Vocational, (3) Moral, (4) Socializing, (5) Conven- 
tional, and (6) Health values. The Cultural Values 
include the (1) development of sentiments, (2) lib- 
eralizing of mind, (3) reconstruction of point of view. 
By Disciplinary Values is meant the reactions of 
studies on the mental processes, attitudes and habits 
of pupils. These values may properly be stated as 
habits of thought, of personal attitude, of action. 
‘While the evidence seems to indicate the impossibility 
of appreciably increasing the mental stature of the 
pupil, it is true that studies provide the stimulations 
necessary to realize the child’s potentialities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
   
Granting that habits are ‘‘specific,’’ the fact remains 
that the complex activities making up a busy life con- 
tain a limited number of types of activity. The in- 
dividual who becomes habituated to a given type of 
activity requires small effort to connect such habit to 
the cue in the new activity. To the practical man 
there is no question that the school program may be 
made to prepare very directly for life. 
The extent and chaiacter of the values which the 
pupil secures from a study depend very largely upon 
the character of the presentation of the subject, and 
in some studies almost entirely so. In some courses 
the value is inherent in the content; in others it is in- 
volved rather in the teaching processes employed. On 
the whole the worth of a study is determined by the 
character of the pupil’s reaction thereto. | 46 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS

  CHAPTER IIT 
TEACHING PROCESSES 
The methods of high school instruction are deter- 
mined, as stated before, in part by the functions of 
the high school, and in part by the educational values 
inherent in studies which the school seeks to realize 
by means of such studies. These methods are deter- 
mined also by the mental processes involved in all sub- 
jects. They are: 
I. The Learning Processes. 
II. The Memory Processes. 
III. Appreciation. 
I, The Learning Processes 
A new subject of study, topic of thought, or problem 
may be approached in either of two ways, depending 
upon the nature of the problem and the extent and 
character of the related information already possessed. 
These are the Inductive Approach and the Deductive 
Approach. Without going into the psychology of 
these processes of investigation, we may say that in 
general the former method of attack is used in the de- 
velopment of new ideas or principles, while the latter 
is used in the application of general principles to 
specific cases, and in criticism.

TEACHING PROCESSES 49 
1. The Inductive Approach 
The inductive approach takes four steps: Acquisi- 
tion of facts; recall of related knowledge; analysis, 
comparison, synthesis; and generalization and naming. 
Acquisition of facts—The data to be used in arriving 
at the solution of a problem are derived from three 
sources, and properly in the order indicated: (1) 
Authority, (2) Observation, (3) Experimentation. 
The class in biology would necessarily use the induc- 
tive approach in the investigation of the problem of 
“The relation of bird life to insect pests.’? The first 
step in the study would be the amassing of a great 
quantity of facts. The larger this acquisition, the 
more reliable the conclusions which may be drawn. If 
the science teacher is intent upon training his pupils 
for scientific procedure as well as on giving them his 
opinion on the subject, he will endeavor to have his 
class gather information of the largest number of 
cases feasible under the situation. He will have his 
pupils first of all exhaust the content of available 
literature on the subject. They will familiarize them- 
selves with the history of former investigations. They 
will accumulate notes of specific cases, such as the dis- 
appearance of certain insects in the locality at the time 
when a certain species of birds become numerous; the 
increase of insects in those districts where bird life 
has become rare; the increase of scale on fruit trees 
with the increase of the sparrow; the number and 
variety of insects found in a robin’s crop. If this 
source of information is exhausted, the class will have  
-P-A-G-E-68
  50 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
a large fund of concrete material from which to gen- 
eralize. Besides, the generalization will have more 
meaning because of the factual background. This 
mastery of available material prepares for the next 
step to be taken in two ways: first, by stimulating per- 
sonal observation on the part of the pupil, and sec- 
ondly, by directing such observation more definitely 
into profitable channels. He will understand what to 
look for and the best way in which to proceed. He 
will also, possibly, discover some aspects of the sub- 
ject for which necessary data have not been found. 
Thus he secures a new motive, the desire to make a 
personal contribution and the realization that the 
thing needed is within the range of his ability. The 
class may be directed to make extensive observations 
of the food supply of the different species of birds liv- 
ing in the vicinity during the season when insects are 
available; they should follow particular birds. They 
should find out all they can on the subject first hand. 
This source of information, of course, is inexhaustible; 
but as he proceeds with the investigation, the pupil 
may discover some aspects of the problem which are 
not cleared up by the results of his reading and obser- 
vation. He then takes the next step, namely, he works 
out an experiment in which he may definitely control 
all of the factors in the situation. He may confine the 
robin and supply it with as many different varieties 
of insects as he can procure and observe whether it eats 
them, and any preference exhibited. The purpose of 
experimentation is to test out reported observations 
and to supplement the results. 
Recall of related knowledge—With an adequate
-P-A-G-E-69
  
TEACHING PROCESSES 51 
accumulation of data the pupils are ready for the sec- 
ond step in the Inductive Approach, namely, recall of 
the discoveries made in similar investigations and of 
the theories which have been advanced in connection 
with the present problem of the relation of birds to 
insect pests. Possibly they will have done this while 
gathering the data. 
Analysis, comparison, synthesis—With all of the 
material before them which they have gathered from 
their own observation, and from their experiments, 
together with the light which their general knowledge 
may throw on the question in the way of suggested 
solution or limitation, the pupils are now ready to ana- 
lyze the several specific cases into their several as- 
pects; select these aspects one by one as points for 
comparison of the several cases; and thus prepare the 
way for generalization. It is important that such anal- 
ysis and synthesis be made systematically. Other- 
wise, the pupil’s mind will rush into a conclusion 
which represents his general impression rather than a 
proper generalization of his experience. To illustrate, 
in his investigation he may have found that all of the 
birds observed eat young grasshoppers. This nat- 
urally suggests a conclusion. But an analysis of his 
notes on the robin may show that this bird eats young 
grasshoppers only when he can get nothing else. Tak- 
ing this aspect of the robin’s habits as a point of com- 
parison, he examines his records in all the birds ob- 
served. Should he find that all are like the robin in 
this particular, he will have arrived at a legitimate 
conclusion. His knowledge is truly definite and trust- 
worthy within the limitation of his study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  52 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Generalization and naming—Abstracting one aspect 
after another from the mass and submitting all cases 
to comparison with reference to this aspect, he soon 
finds his knowledge organized and synthesized or com- 
pacted into a small number of propositions. This is 
the process of generalization. One thing however re- 
mains. The last step is to give the generalization a 
proper expression in language; that is, to formulate 
a statement which includes all of the facts which pro- 
perly belong, showing them in their proper correla- 
tion, and noting all exceptions, extreme variations 
and exclusions. Definition or Naming is exceedingly 
vital both as completing the thought process and as 
making it available for subsequent use. Carelessness 
at this point will largely vitiate the whole process. 
We think in words, and, very generally, remember 
what we report as our generalization rather than the 
actual conclusion. Good teaching makes sure that the 
pupil concludes his research with a statement which 
tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth. 
2. A Modified Form of the Inductive Process 
The Inductive Method, however, takes another form 
for the development of concepts of individual things 
or of classes of objects; for example, the Battle of the 
Marne, the Ohio River, the Maple Tree, Whittier’s 
“Snow Bound.’’? In studies like these the learning 
process will generally take the following form: 
(a) The determination of those qualities or aspects 
of the individual or the group which are apprehended
-P-A-G-E-71
  
TEACHING PROCESSES 53 
through sense experience; namely, through vision, 
hearing, touch, taste, smell and resistance. This will 
include size, shape, direction, color, sound, odor, savor, 
texture, surface, strength, etc. as these may be in- 
volved in the thing studied. 
(b) Examination of the relations of the thing or 
group studied to other individuals or groups with ref- 
erence to the categories of: Time and Place, Whole 
and Part, Similarity and Contrast, and Cause and 
Effect. 
(c) Consideration of the relations of the thing or 
group to the learner. 
3. Illustrations of Inductive Approach 
Lesson plan for study of the maple—In an exhaustive 
study of the maple tree, the class proceeds first to in- 
vestigate those characteristics of maple trees which 
are apprehended through the senses. Thus they will 
consider the form and size of the maple, the propor- 
tion of trunk and top, height and circumference, color 
of bark and leaf, leaf shape, the angle of the limbs, 
movement if any; and such other facts as may be ob- 
served with the eye. This will be followed by the ques- 
tion as to whether a maple forest gives out a character- 
istic sound. Next the textile characteristics of leaf, 
bark, the polished and unpolished wood; the taste of 
leaf sap, of bark, of body sap; the odors given off; the 
brittleness, flexibility and tensile strength of the wood. 
In acquiring this information the three sources out- 
lined in the preceding pages will be utilized—Authority, 
Observation, and Experiment. Having exhausted
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
these aspects of the subject, the class will then ap- 
proach the relationships of the maple. These will in- 
clude, under the first category, Time and Place, the 
period of growth, age limits, seasonal relations, dura- 
bility of wood, habitat. Under the head of Similarity 
and Contrast will be considered the likenesses and dif- 
ferences of the maple and other kinds of trees, the 
varieties of maples with their distinguishing charac- 
teristics, and the variation of individual trees. Tree 
anatomy and botanical classification will come under 
the head of Whole and Part. The causal relations in- 
volve the facts as to reproduction, conditions of 
growth, ecology, and the uses made of the maple. The 
last division of the study, relations of the maple tree 
to the pupil, may not offer much of importance aside 
from sentimental values which will not have been con- 
sidered under other heads. But these sentimental 
values may have great significance in the making of 
personality even if their scientific worth is small. It 
is very much worth while to speak of the maple in con- 
nection with pioneer life, of historic individual trees, 
and of any symbolism which has been attached to it by 
custom. 
Plan for study of the Battle of the Marne—In the 
study of the Battle of the Marne the class will pass 
through the same particular processes, but not neces- 
sarily in the same order. Logically, time and place 
relations would be considered first; the time with re- 
ference to the climax of the war as well as by the cal- 
endar; the place relations including location, extent 
and topography. The class might properly follow the 
movements leading up to the battle and the objectives 
\
-P-A-G-E-73
TEACHING PROCESSES 55 
whose realization turned upon the outcome of the con- 
test; the relation of the battle to the campaign of which 
it was a part, and of the campaign to the war as a 
whole, and of the war to the historical and economic 
struggle of which it was a part; the parallelism of this 
battle and the climaxes of other great wars—Waterloo, 
Sedan, Gettysburg. The immediate and ultimate re- 
sults of the victory of civilization at the Marne cer- 
tainly must have great emphasis. . All of these aspects 
of the battle offer topics for extended discussion. - But 
if the pupils are to comprehend in the fullest measure 
the enormity of the struggle, the horrible depths to 
which human nature will descend under the lash of 
greed and lust, the fearful price which was paid that 
liberty might survive the titanic forces of body and 
spirit hurled at each other across those swift waters, 
they must also see the rushing hordes, hear the hellish 
roar, the curses of mad men, the shrieks of dying men; 
they must smell the reek of blood and the sulphurous 
smoke of man-made hell; they must sense the struggle 
of it, the destruction; they must live it through if our 
teaching is to help prevent The Marne’s being fought 
again. The order of treatment may be transposed but 
the concrete and particular as well as the relational 
elements must be wrought into the concept if it is to 
have meaning for the pupil. 
Plan for study of a literary selection—The study of a 
literary selection will involve the same processes with 
possible change of order. To read ‘‘Snow Bound’’ 
means to reproduce the emotional experience which 
Whittier has embodied in the imagery, the musical 
elements, and the symbolic memories of the poem. 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  56 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Obviously the sense elements here are predominant. 
The meanings of words, tone, pitch, motifs, rhythm, 
are first to be apprehended. Then there are questions 
of time and place, but particularly of contrasts; con- 
trasts of place, of characters, of night and day, of the 
blazing logs on the hearth and the bitter chill without, 
the pulsing humanness of the family circle and the cold 
inhumanity of the snow covered world the next day. 
By means of the music of his verse, the sequence of 
visual images, and the series of character and plot con- 
trasts, the author carries the reader through varied 
emotions up to the conception which the poem em- 
bodies. The pupil comes to know the poem by follow- 
ing the same order of processes. 
Further illustrations of the Inductive Approach will 
be given in the later discussions of special method of 
the several studies. 
4. The Deductive Approach 
The Deductive Approach is employed in many 
studies in the illustration of general principles or rules 
by application to particular cases. This process is fa- 
miliar in algebra, physics, the identification of plants, 
and the rules of grammar in foreign language study. 
While new knowledge may be derived or assistance 
secured in the solution of a problem, the chief purpose 
is to strengthen the mental grasp of the generalization. 
That such exercise is necessary is patent, and that in 
the pressure of work this phase of teaching is likely 
to be underdone is obvious. Most teaching is vitiated
-P-A-G-E-75
  TEACHING PROCESSES 57 
by too little illustrative application. But the deduc- 
tive lesson may be employed effectively in the applica- 
tion of generalizations to new studies or fields of in- 
quiry. Thus the generalizations of algebra and ge- 
ometry may be turned back to illumine the difficulties 
of arithmetic, Latin made to clear up English construc- 
tions, history to give an illuminating setting for the 
better understanding of literature. The generaliza- 
tions of one study may be employed to introduce the 
facts and principles of a correlative study. Again 
they may be applied to current problems of life. The 
history of colonial governments will assist the pupil 
in thinking out the principles of America’s policy 
toward her dependencies. The principles of physics 
may be applied to the problems of community water 
supply, the heating, lighting and ventilation of build- 
ings, the city light plant, municipal heat plant, ete. 
This phase of teaching must be emphasized if the 
school is to be truly dynamic, if it serves its function 
of preparing pupils for the business of intelligent 
living. 
II. The Memory Processes 
The efficient teacher not only seeks to impart knowl- 
edge and develop skill but to direct his teaching in 
such a way that the pupil retains the knowledge and 
skill under instant command. There may be some 
value occurring from studies whose content is forgot- 
ten but on the whole the pupil’s memory of instruction 
is the measure of the success of his labors. The ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tent and quality of what the pupil retains from a les- 
son is the index of the efficiency of the teacher. 
1. Waste Involved in Memory Losses 
The enormous waste involved in memory losses 
gives a very practical reason for special attention to 
this aspect of the teaching process. It is reported 
that thirty per cent of the content of a lesson is lost 
within one hour unless the exercise is directed into 
channels to avoid such waste. Under the same condi- 
tions, there will be further loss of twenty per cent sus- 
tained within twenty-four hours, and an additional 
thirty per cent within one month. This would indicate 
a total loss under careless instruction of eighty per 
cent within a month. . Granting that these statements 
are greatly exaggerated, the loss certainly is so serious 
as to command attention of the reader. There is the 
further reason for such concern in the fact that student 
ability is determined by the wealth of memory con- 
tent. To think is to apply remembered concepts to 
the new situation. The individual with impaired 
memory is mentally feeble to the extent of such im- 
pairment. The pupil whose retention of presupposed 
information is uncertain is hopeless. These facts are 
commonplace to the teacher, and yet so intent is the 
average instructor upon the presentative phase of 
teaching that he is quite certain to overlook the neces- 
sity of making sure that the results of his labor are 
not speedily dissipated. 
Two sets of memory principles need emphasis ; those 
relating to Retention, and those relating to Recall.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
TEACHING PROCESSES 59 
2. Teaching for Retention 
The conditions which insure permanent retention 
are: Native Retentiveness, Favorable Attitude, 
Strength of First Impression, and Repetition. 
Relation of health to retentiveness—Retentiveness 
is to some degree native and hence beyond the control 
of the school. But this aspect of memory is a physi- 
ological function, depending upon the plasticity of the 
brain, and therefore subject to modification by the 
health of the pupil. Irregularities in the physiologi- 
cal regimen of high school youth, insufficient nutrition, 
loss of sleep, excesses of all kinds, interrupted physio- 
logical functions, poor school situation—whatever im- 
poverishes the blood supply and is a drain upon vital- 
ity impairs retentiveness, and necessarily must be sub- 
ject to school regulation for pedagogical as well as for 
hygienic reasons. Wholesome living is as necessary 
to efficient school work in the sense of providing a 
proper physiological machinery as in the sense of sav- 
ing time and conserving attention. The school must, 
as a matter of self-defense as well as of duty, assume 
a larger share of responsibility for the physical wel- 
fare of its students. 
Effect of mental attitude—Ordinarily the mind re- 
tains more successfully those experiences which have a 
pleasurable tone. This fact is the ground for the ef- 
fort to maintain a state of good-feeling in the school, a 
contented spirit, and, in particular, a favorable atti- 
tude toward the studies. It is helpful to spend time 
in arousing a pleasant anticipation of the subject. 
The inspiring teacher gets the largest net results, not 
only because she commands a fuller attention of her 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  60 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
class and secures better application, but also because 
of the glow of feeling which she imparts. A state of 
enthusiasm ‘‘warms the wax of the mind’’ and makes 
it more impressionable. 
Importance of vivid impression—Obviously the 
deeper the impression the more enduring it is. Clear- 
ness of definition, aptness of illustration, and vigor of 
statement secure fuller attention. Concentration of 
the mind of the class upon the matter in hand is neces- 
sary to permanence of impression. Whatever of the 
teacher’s enthusiasm, of device, of concrete embodi- 
ment, of personal application serves to command all 
the attention for the time will deepen the impression. 
The classroom atmosphere should be charged with en- 
ergy, the pupils keyed up to the verge of excitement. 
The good smith works his metal hot. He makes poor 
headway with cold iron. The teacher does no better 
with half-energized or indifferent pupils. His impres- 
sions are deepest when his classes are worked up to 
keen expectation. Intense application for a brief pe- 
riod yields much better results than the same amount 
of energy spread over a longer period. Senator Stan- 
ford, the dean of modern horse breeders, based his 
training method on the rule, ‘‘Compel the colt to go 
his best for his distance.’? His theory was that it is 
the animal’s supreme effort, stopping short of the fa- 
tigue point, which brings growth. This principle ap- 
plies equally well in teaching. The pupil’s maxi- 
mum effort for a proper period gets results. Less 
than his best effort is a waste of time. 
Value of repetition—Repetition is the fourth condi-
-P-A-G-E-79
  TEACHING PROCESSES 61 
tion of retention. The more frequent the repetition, 
provided no exceptions are permitted, the more def- 
initely the corresponding brain path is organized. 
This is the well known law of habit formation, the 
basis of memory and of skill. Possibly no other prin- 
ciple of psychology is more generally ignored in the 
high school. Mrill, Drill, Drill, is the price of preci- 
sion 4nd-memory, Viv vidness” oF presentation of-sub- 
ject matter, enthusiasm, interest will reduce the 
amount of dvilh necessary, but can not wholly displace 
drill. There was a time when school work was too 
largely of this nature. The resultant reaction has 
gone quite to the other extreme. Courses of study 
have been elaborated and the content of studies en- 
riched. Teaching is improved in many respects. 
But because of the lack of patient, painstaking, con- 
tinued drill, the present day high school graduate 
knows a little about a great many things, but knows 
little with real certainty. No sensible person would 
advise a return to the methods and curricula of former 
days, yet all must recognize that the human mind is 
constructed on a definite plan to which all must con- 
form. The necessity of constant drill on the things 
which we want permanently retained can not be es- 
eaped. <A soldier is not made by a lecture on squad 
formation and a demonstration of the manual of arms. 
There is much in the high school subjects—more pos- 
sibly than we realize—of mere formal work whose pos- 
session is acquired in precisely the same way that the 
recruit is made into a soldier, namely, by persistent 
repetition.
-P-A-G-E-80
62 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
3. Teaching for Recall 
There are two conditions of effective recall: Asso- 
ciation of Ideas, and Organization of Ideas. 
Association of ideas—The principle of association 
is fundamentally physiological; namely, ideas which 
are thought together tend to recall each other there- 
-after. Frequent repetition of a series will increase 
this tendency. If the ideas are logically related, the 
tendency is increased in much greater degree. The 
careful teacher seeks to connect the new ideas with the 
older ideas in the minds of the pupils, particularly 
with those which have promise of permanent retention 
and prompt recall. She secures this connection by 
causing the pupil to think the relations sustained 
by the objects of thought, such as their contiguity in 
time and place, their similarity and contrast, their 
causal relations and the like. Thus she causes the 
pupil to weave the series of ideas into a chain, each 
link of which is held within the links preceding and fol- 
lowing. If one idea of such a series is brought into 
consciousness it will bring after it the entire series. 
Organization of ideas—The organization of knowl- 
edge is a further application of the principle of asso- 
ciation. It is the association of ideas around a cen- 
tral theme or in the form of a classification. Chapter 
and book summaries secure such organization of ma- 
terial. It is a good practice to close the lesson with a 
summary of the content of the discussion reduced to a 
few pointed statements. Each division of the sub- 
ject should be similarly treated. Outlines prepared by
-P-A-G-E-81
TEACHING PROCESSES 63 
the pupils, showing the division and the subdivision of 
the subject, are fine exercises for the same purpose. 
Organizing reviews are also of great value. These 
various exercises weave the content of studies into a 
fabric which it is easy for the pupil to hold and to 
utilize when need arises. They also give perspective 
and that feeling of definiteness and certainty which the 
pupil craves. It would seem superfluous to warn the 
teacher against making outlines and summaries for 
her pupils, formerly a somewhat common crime of the 
school. The value is not in having the outline or sum- 
mary, but in making it. Pupils should be encouraged 
to be original in such organization. Frequently sev- 
eral forms of summary are equally worthy. A pre- 
mium should be put on individual generalization. And 
pupils should be encouraged also to organize their les- 
sons in preparing for a recitation. This practice well 
established will secure permanent improvement of 
study. 
III. Appreciation 
Definition—Appreciation is a by-product rather 
than a process. It is tri-phasal. There is first the 
element of enjoyment. To appreciate signifies to en- 
joy, to like, to find pleasure in the activity or object. 
Second, there is the element of recognition of the in- 
trinsic worth of the activity or object; the sense of a 
value residing within it wholly apart from its rela- 
tions to the person or to other things. In this sense to 
appreciate means to value, or to judge that the thing 
is inherently valuable. In the third place, there is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
volitional element, somewhat in the background of con- 
sciousness, possibly, but certainly present in the form 
of an avowed attachment and devotion to the thing. 
Thus, appreciation of poetry involves enjoyment of 
verse, the conviction that it is a good thing in itself, 
and the attitude of patronizing poetry. To appreciate 
art means to find pleasure in it, to regard it as a good, 
and to encourage it in various ways as a visitor at 
exhibits, as a contributor, a supporter, a defender or 
advocate. On the intellectual side it may signify also 
a discriminating judgment of the relative merits of art 
productions. 
Four types of situation which arouse appreciation— 
As indicated in the preceding chapter, there are four 
types of situations which arouse appreciation; the in- 
tellectual, the esthetic, the humorous, and the moral. 
We thus may speak of four kinds or types of apprecia- 
tion: Intellectual, A‘sthetic, Humor, and Apprecia- 
tion of Manhood, or Ethical Appreciation. The first 
is commonly known as the Scientific Spirit, the 
Scholarly Attitude, or Wit, depending upon the phase 
of mental activity which commands attention. The 
second is commonly known as Taste; the third as the 
Sense of Humor, and the last as the ability to judge 
the worth of men and women, and the tendency to react 
emotionally to personality. 
Appreciation as a factor in education—Thoughtful 
educators are coming to see that the cultivation of ap- 
preciation in these four forms is possibly the greatest 
service which the school and college can render. Cer- 
tainly, however valuable accurate scholarship is in it- 
self, the scholarly attitude of mind, critical judgment,
-P-A-G-E-83
  TEACHING PROCESSES 65 
the disposition to investigate, to find for one’s self the 
facts involved, to check and prove, and to exult in the 
truth discovered—these habits and attitudes of mind 
are far more profitable personally and socially. The 
high school and college have no higher privilege than 
the nurture of the spirit of truth-seeking and truth- 
telling, the spirit of investigation, and admiration of 
intellectual performance. In art education the de- 
velopment of appreciation is the primary objective, 
and the necessary condition of technical skill. Taste 
is a large determining factor of life. As scholarship 
frees the soul from the prison walls of ignorance, so 
the ability to perceive and enjoy beauty frees the soul 
from the deadening grind of monotony and drudgery. 
Dwelling in a world of conscious beauty, a world of 
birds’ songs, of color, of fragrance, of sparkling dew 
drops, a world speaking to the soul of the beauty of 
life, will lift that soul above the blighting hand of de- 
spair. An eminent specialist in the care of the insane 
was asked to advise a class of young teachers with re- 
gard to the best form of social service which they could 
render. His reply was: ‘‘Go out and open the eyes 
of the people to the beauty of sky and field, of music 
and verse, that their minds and souls may be kept 
sweet and sane.’’ The same may be said in behalf of 
the cultivation of the sense of humor. Its practical 
value to the man and woman whose work requires 
them to get along with people can not be over- 
emphasized. But as a condition or means of giving 
the individual a proper perspective of life, as a cura- 
tive measure in crooked thinking and of wrong atti- 
tudes, it is of even greater value. Humor is the salt
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
with which human nature is kept fresh and wholesome. 
Moral appreciation or the ability to judge men, and 
the enjoyment of the best men, President Eliot has 
said, is the essence of a sound education. The man 
who possesses this species of ability and this emotional 
tendency is an educated man in the most vital sense. 
To be able to discern the true worth of an individual, 
to perceive his elements of strength and weakness, and 
to enjoy greatness of manhood wherever it may be 
discovered, is to command at the same time a valuable 
ability and the source of the rarest human satisfaction. 
Knowledge and skill are socially necessary. They are 
proper objectives of sound education. But the highest 
objective in point of social value and personal satis- 
faction is the developed and trained appreciation. 
Appreciation and personality—Appreciation is a 
large factor in the composition of personality. In the 
first place it is highly recreative. This is particularly 
true of esthetic appreciation. To the man who has 
learned to find joy in beauty, whether of music, art, 
literature, or nature, there is a perpetual fountain of 
youth from which he draws new energy and new hope 
for the tasks of to-morrow. In the second place it is 
formative. The boy absorbs into the texture of his 
soul the color and the tone of the emotional experi- 
ences awakened by the object of his admiration. This 
is especially so in the case of his attachment to his 
ideal man and woman, whether a real person or the 
hero of his day dreams. And again, one’s type of ap- 
preciation determines for him his associations, and 
hence his field of imitation. ‘‘Tell me the kind of 
music your son enjoys and I will tell you where to find
-P-A-G-E-85
  TEACHING PROCESSES 67 
him.’’ Or tell us the kind of things your boy thinks 
fun and we will tell you the kind of man he is becoming. 
Appreciation developed through reaction to form and 
content—The cultural values discussed in the preced- 
ing chapter depend almost wholly upon the type and 
degree of appreciation developed in the pupil. Hence 
the importance of understanding how it is developed. 
Properly speaking Appreciation is induced: first, 
through the reactions secured to elements of form; 
second, through the reactions to elements of content. 
That is, appreciation is the product of those emotional 
experiences which accompany the motor responses 
brought out through the stimulation of elements of 
form and content in art, humor, intellectual activity 
and persons. The character of the motor response 
determines the degree of appreciation, and the type of 
situation which brings out the motor response de- 
termines the type of appreciation. 
Elements of form—The elements of form in these 
stimulating situations are three: Rhythm, Grammar, 
and Style. This terminology varies with the different 
fields of appreciation. Rhythm, including symmetry, 
balance, proportion, variety in unity, meter, motif, 
tone, color, arouses definite reactions, both motor and 
sensory. It is fundamental in human nature. The 
reactions are instinctive. If the response is wholly 
unrestrained the emotional experience will be corres- 
pondingly rich. The natural reaction to music is the 
dance, not the conventionalized parody of the sex- 
conscious functions, but the spontaneous response to 
metre, pitch, and motif. To poetry the natural reac- 
tion is a combination of pose, dance, and chant; to
-P-A-G-E-86
  68 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
art it is the pose; to architecture the following of the 
lines in balanced sequence. In language it is the vocal- 
ization of the words, and impersonation. The point 
of significance in the present connection is that it is 
in the richness of the motor reaction that the character 
of the emotional experience is grounded and the degree 
of appreciation awakened. The teacher of poetry who 
desires to arouse appreciation of the particular selec- 
tion, or of all poetry, must cause her pupils to experi- 
ence the cadence, the refrain, the accent, the mimicry 
of the words, the musical pitch, either by actual repro- 
duction of these elements or by making the muscular 
adjustments involved in the reproductions. Language 
is a mode of behavior more or less conventionalized. 
The attitudes involved in the initial behavior embodied 
in words are an essential part of the poem and are to 
be reproduced if the full value of the selection is to 
be realized. It is the reproduction of the ‘‘behavior’’ 
within the rhythm of the poem, in the musical key in 
which it is written, and in proper time and force, that 
secures the feeling which gives the reader a full experi- 
ence. Appreciation like every other mental function 
is subject to habit. Any type of literary or musical 
experience frequently repeated for a considerable 
period forms a habit, a strong tendency to respond 
pleasurably to that type of situation, and an equally 
strong corresponding tendency not to respond to other 
types of situation. The question is frequently raised 
as to why the American people do not appreciate 
poetry. A partial answer is found in the fact that in 
the first place it is very generally presented to the
-P-A-G-E-87
TEACHING PROCESSES 69 
pupil as a logical exercise with the purpose of giving 
him an intellectual experience rather than as a motor 
exercise for the purpose of giving him an emotional 
experience. In the second place, the exposure is too 
short. The pupil does not have sufficient repetition of 
the experience to form the desired habit of reaction. 
His associations with poetry and poetry lovers are too 
slight. 
The second element of form in all varieties of art is 
grammar, or the technique of composition. Again we 
may take our illustration from language. Just as 
words are conventionalized modes of behavior so the 
grammatical relations of words in the sentence are 
conventionalized modes of human behavior. The prep- 
ositions, the conjunctions, auxiliaries, participles, and 
arrangements of phrases and clauses, all involve an 
ordered sequence of behavior which if reproduced in 
fact, or in appropriate motor adjustments, will make 
the reading of the sentence a real motor reaction with 
such emotional reflex as to give the pupil a pleasur- 
able experience, and with continued associations a 
definite appreciation. 
The third element of form is style, including con- 
trast, development, climax, ete. Again, style is a 
mode of behavior, and its beauty can be realized by the 
reader only as reproduced in fact, or in appropriate 
motor adjustment for such reproduction. The read- 
justments required to express adequately the contrast 
of place, time, condition and character in a literary 
selection; to respond to the development of plot and 
character and the climax, have their counterpart in
-P-A-G-E-88
  70 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
music, and are the basis of the experience which if suf- 
ficiently continued will result in a definite attitude or 
appreciation. 
Response to congruence of content with personal ex- 
perience—It was pointed out above that appreciation 
was also induced by reaction to content. This also is 
a motor reaction with its emotional accompaniment. 
This reaction may be a response to the congruence of 
content with personal experience or habitual behavior, 
or to the correspondence of content with dominant im- 
pulses, imperative needs, moods and temperaments of 
the pupil. One naturally reacts pleasurably to a 
thought which harmonizes with his own point of view, 
or which corroborates his own opinion. We crave 
justification, and so are disposed to attach great value 
to an expression which we feel goes to establish the 
correctness of our thought or behavior. This is par- 
ticularly true when we have taken an unconventional 
position. The same principle is involved when the ser- 
mon, address, book, statue, musical composition or pic- 
ture gives adequate expression to a state of mind which 
the individual had been unable to express adequately 
for himself. Much of the attractiveness of the oratory 
of the great political or social leader is due to the fact 
that he gives satisfactory expression to what the 
masses have wanted to say but had been unable to ex- 
press. The vogue of war-time music, of folk-music 
and of the jazz band is explained largely on the same 
principle. 
Pleasurable response to that which fits one’s mood— 
We also respond pleasurably and affirmatively to those
-P-A-G-E-89
  TEACHING PROCESSES 7 
things which fit our moods, suit our temperament, 
gratify our impulses, and satisfy our needs. ‘‘Misery 
loves company,’’ ‘‘ All the world loves a lover.’’ The 
youngster pulsing with red blood is thrilled by the ex- 
ploits of the adventurer. The Knights of the Round 
Table, Ivanhoe, and Cooper’s heroes are his natural 
food. Later will come other impulses which as nat- 
urally crave the feeding grounds of the problem novel, 
biography, or philosophical discourse. And there will 
come those seasonal and personal experiences which 
make the heart find satisfaction in appropriate verse 
or music. The sensible teacher of literature under- 
stands that she must be guided in the selection of ma- 
terial by the mood of her pupils. She is quick to take 
advantage of special occasions and incidents. She 
does not undertake to thrust a song of death upon a 
class shouting with the joy of youth, nor to dwell upon 
fields of nodding daisiesin mid-December. She under- 
stands that there is a situation now and then when 
*“Snow Bound’’ comes ‘‘home’’ to the class, and when 
nothing else from Whittier does appeal. 
Creating a favorable situation—It frequently happens 
that the proper situation does not arise for begetting 
the mood appropriate to the selection assigned. In 
such case it will be necessary for the teacher to create 
a situation through working upon the imagination of 
her pupils, or by means of other preparatory exercises. 
The point is that her labor will be ineffectual unless 
the selection does fit the mood or gratify a dominant 
impulse of her pupils. A second reason for the in- 
difference of the average American reader to poetry is 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that he does not approach it with the appropriate back 
ground of experience. He has not learned to make use 
of poetry for personal expression. It has not entered 
into his life; he has not experienced it. The high 
school can do much to correct this deficiency in pre- 
serving the naiveté of the primary school by fitting 
poetry to the pupil instead of the converse. 
Perceiving personal relationships—Perception of the 
noetic relation is always conducive to appreciation. 
One naturally thinks well of those things which belong 
to himself, to his family, city or country. Insight into 
personal relations induces increased regard. This is 
particularly true of intellectual and ethical apprecia- 
tion. And so the wise teacher endeavors to lead her 
pupils to a clear insight into the significance for human 
life of the thing or person studied. 
Admiration of superior craftsmanship—It was sug- 
gested in a previous paragraph that we are disposed 
to admire the successful expression of ideas, ideals, 
and hopes to which we have failed to give adequate 
utterance. This involves the principle that apprecia- 
tion is also grounded in the satisfaction derived from 
the assurance that one’s failures or partial successes 
are not final, as well as upon the fact that experience 
in performance affords better appreciation of the mas- 
ter performance. The pianist of moderate experience 
can better appreciate the work of the artist than the 
listener who plays not at all. The man without surgi- 
cal knowledge and experience may wonder at the skill 
of the great surgeon, but he cannot appreciate it as 
does the young assistant surgeon. A very successful
-P-A-G-E-91
  TEACHING PROCESSES 73 
teacher of poetry depends upon this principle of execu- 
tion. He leads up to the selection assigned by having 
his students attempt the theme of the selection in origi- 
nal verse. <A high school teacher found her students 
losing interest in the critical study of Silas Marner 
which her curriculum required. Most of her class had 
formed a distaste for the book. It occurred to her to 
change the attack. She assumed a given incident in 
the plot to be changed in a significant particular and 
asked what effect the change would have on the out- 
come. A vigorous discussion ensued at once and re- 
sulted in a challenge to the class to reorganize the plot 
and character portrayal of the remainder of the book 
in harmony with the assumed change. Then followed 
some days of the keenest study of details of technique, 
of character and plot problems, of rhetorical princi- 
ples, and a rare delight in what had been a bore. Lit- 
erature, music and graphic art offer numerous oppor- 
tunities for similar treatment. 
Suggestion by the teacher—The effect of the pupil’s 
association with the teacher should not be overlooked. 
Children are creatures of suggestion. They are dis- 
posed to accept and assume uncritically the standards 
and attitudes of persons having prestige. The 
teacher, if at all likable, enjoys the necessary prestige. 
Unconsciously the pupils imbibe her tastes. They 
come to like what she likes; to dismiss what she does 
not like. Admiring her, they admire and seek after 
and become what she is and admires. After all, in- 
timate association with persons of wholesome apprecia- 
tion is the most certain way to attain the same end. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  74 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
IV. Summary 
The psychological processes of immediate applica- 
tion in the teaching of high school subjects are those 
involved in (1) learning, (2) in memory, and (38) in 
appreciation. 
The approach to a new topic or subject may be either 
Inductive or Deductive. 
The inductive approach takes four steps: (1) ac- 
quisition of facts; (2) recall of related knowledge 
possessed by the pupil; (3) analysis, comparison, syn- 
thesis of the material secured in (1) and (2); (4) gen- 
eralization and naming. 
The facts necessary to induction are derived from 
(1) authority, (2) observation, and (3) experimenta- 
tion, and properly in the order named. The related 
knowledge to be recalled will comprise the discoveries 
made in similar investigations together with any new 
theories which have been advanced as to the present 
problem. 
The analysis and synthesis of data is the vital step 
in the inductive process: comparison should proceed 
systematically from one aspect to another until the 
data have been exhausted; generalizations should be 
earefully stated. 
A modified form of the inductive method is employed 
in the development of a concept of the individual tak- 
ing the form of (1) determination of those qualities or 
aspects which are apprehended through sense experi- 
ence, and (2) examination of the relations of the thing 
with reference to the categories of Time and Place, 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
TEACHING PROCESSES 15 
Whole and Part, Similarity and Contrast, and Cause 
and Effect. 
The Deductive Approach is employed in many 
studies in the illustration of general principles by their 
application to particular cases. There is need of 
greater emphasis of the ‘‘application step’’ in the 
teaching process. 
Two sets of principles need emphasis in connection 
with the effort to improve the efficiency of memory: 
those relating to Retention, and those relating to 
Reeall. 
The conditions of effective retention are: (1) na- 
tive retentiveness, (2) favorable attitude, (3) strength 
of first impression, (4) repetition. The conditions of 
effective recall are: (1) association of ideas, (2) or- 
ganization of knowledge. 
Appreciation is a by-product rather than a process. 
It has three elements: enjoyment, the recognition of 
intrinsic worth in the object or activity, and a per- 
sonal attachment or devotion to the thing. 
There are four types of appreciation: the intellec- 
tual, the esthetic, the humorous, the moral. The cul- 
tivation of appreciation in these four forms is pos- 
sibly the greatest service which the school can perform. 
Appreciation is the product of the emotional experi- 
ences stimulated by the elements of (1) form and 
(2) content in art, humor, intellectual activity, and 
persons. The character of the motor response to a 
situation determines the degree of appreciation, and 
the type of the stimulating situation determines the 
type of appreciation. 
The elements of form in these stimulating situations  
-P-A-G-E-94
    76 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
are: Rhythm, Technique, Style. The elements of 
content are the congruence of the content with the per- 
sonal experience, dominant impulses, habitual behav- 
ior, and moods of the individual.

    CHAPTER IV 
THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 
Potential values in study of English 
Reverting to our study of Educational Values, it 
will be recalled that we concluded that the study of 
the vernacular and its literature has very high po- 
tential values. We observed that the ability to read 
well and rapidly and to express our thoughts ade- 
quately is in the highest degree a condition of success 
in all other studies; that the language arts are of the 
highest significance in practical life; that moral values 
are largely determined for the individual through the 
experience depending upon facility of communication; 
that social character is grounded upon those imme- 
diate and remoter relationships made possible through 
facility of language functions; and that excellence of 
one’s command of English and its literary content is 
required above all other attainments by conventional- 
ity. The contributions of English to culture were 
found to be equally large. No subject in the curricu- 
lum has higher sentimental values than literature, and 
none is richer in content of a reconstructive character, 
at least none in the high school curriculum. The lib- 
eralizing possibilities and the disciplinary values are 
only slightly less. If our analysis is even approxi- 
78
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 79 
mately correct, the educational functions of the English 
course are the most significant for all classes of stu- 
dents, and thus it is the most important subject in the 
curriculum. 
Objectives—The problem of the English teacher is 
the elaboration of a course of instruction and training 
which will realize these possible values. This result 
obviously will be consummated by accomplishing three 
objectives: 
Facility of Expression. 
Power of Interpretation. 
Appreciation. 
Facility of Expression involves: (a) accuracy of 
statement, including the choice of appropriate words 
and grammatical sentence construction; (b) rapidity 
of language functions; and (c) attractiveness or 
beauty of language. Power of interpretation involves 
skill in getting the thought readily, fully and ac- 
curately from specch as well as from the printed page. 
Literary appreciation includes good taste in the mat- 
ter of language employed, insight into and affectionate 
regard for literary content, and good judgment as to 
the merit of literary effort. 
Not a new task—These three objectives set out the 
task of the teacher of English. It is a large under- 
taking, far more than she may hope to accomplish with 
high school pupils, more than will be completed in 
college courses. But these objectives define the three 
lines of effort which she must pursue. She must work 
toward these ends, going as far as local conditions will
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
permit. She will recognize that they do not constitute 
a new task. In fact, she inherits not only the product 
of the elementary school but also the responsibility of 
continuing the processes assigned in the elementary 
school to the so-called language arts—reading, writing, 
spelling, composition and grammar. Her task is a 
continuation of these lines of work, not a new 
undertaking. 
Hospital service—As a sensible person, the English 
teacher will recognize the implications of the fact that 
her work is a continuation of the program of the grade 
school and that in the nature of things her department 
must be a sort of hospital to which are brought the 
cripples of reading, spelling, writing and grammar 
courses. Ideally, her pupils should come to her well 
finished in these things. But a large number of 
them are not. Being sensible, she will set herself to 
removing their disabilities. They interrupt her plans 
for the year’s work, and yet she remembers that she 
is to serve the pupils, fitting her work to their condi- 
tion and carrying them forward as far as possible 
toward the goal of her department. This means that 
she must provide spelling classes for those who 
reached the high school without having learned to 
spell; that she must provide lessons in penmanship for 
those who have not learned to write legibly; lessons 
in phonics and the use of the dictionary for those who 
are defective in these respects; lessons in voice and 
enunciation for those whose earlier teachers have 
been negligent of these particulars; and lessons in 
grammar for the numerous victims of soft pedagogy. 
She must do a vast deal of such reclamation work for
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 81 
two reasons: first, because the pupils have a right to it 
and the primary function of the high school for the 
many is to complete the training begun in the lower 
school; second, she must do it in order to go forward 
to new work with any promise of success. 
Co-operation of all teachers necessary—But in facing 
her task the teacher of English has certain rights as 
well as responsiblities. One of her rights is the right 
to the active sympathetic co-operation of the entire 
school faculty. She may insist that her problem is 
necessarily shared by all of the teachers who share 
her pupils. Ina real sense English can not be depart- 
mentalized. Our philosophy postulates that the 
subject-object relation can not be resolved. Form and 
content can not be dissociated. The word and the 
idea are not independent realities; rather they are as- 
pects of the same thing. They can not be dissociated. 
The idea is not fully comprehended apart from its 
word and the word has no meaning, hence no value, 
apart from its idea. They can not be separated in 
thought or use. Hence every teacher of a ‘‘content’’ 
study must be a teacher of ‘‘form,’’ and every teacher 
of a ‘‘formal’’ subject must be a teacher of ‘‘content.’’ 
This means that no statement in science or history or 
mathematics is correct as to substance unless it is 
also correct as to the language employed. Therefore, 
every teacher necessarily is a language teacher. If 
this necessity is cheerfully recognized and all of the 
resources of the school properly organized, the burden 
of the English department will be wonderfully re- 
duced. At the same time the work of the other de- 
partments will be equally improved.
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Oral and Written English 
The course in English must also be governed by the 
fact that language takes two forms, speech and writ- 
ing. This requires that provision must be made for 
training in both forms. The processes of interpreta- 
tion and expression are purely matters of habit. And 
habits are specific. That is, the skill involved in in- 
terpretation of the printed page is a specialized skill— 
skill in the specific process of reading; it does not 
carry over into the interpretation of speech. Ability 
to read does not involve the ability to ‘‘hear’’ dis- 
course, and, conversely, the ability to apprehend ade- 
quately and appreciate the spoken word does not as- 
sure equal ability with reference to the printed word. 
The principle that skill is specific applies equally to 
composition. Facility with the pen does not assure 
fluency of speech, nor does ability to express oneself 
with accuracy and good taste in speech give equal 
power of written composition. Since appreciation is 
grounded in both expression and interpretation it fol- 
lows that the training which develops appreciation of 
one form of discourse will not suffice for the other. 
From the psychology of habit in relation to language, 
we must conclude that provision must be made for 
both oral and written composition: interpretation of 
oral as well as written discourses; and for appreciation 
of the spoken as well as of the written message. 
Accuracy 
Depends on vocabulary mastery—Accuracy of state- 
ment is grounded in: (a) the choice of the most ap-
-P-A-G-E-101
THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 83 
propriate word, and (b) proper sentence construction. 
The former is conditioned by the quantity or copious- 
ness of the vocabulary and the quality of word mas- 
tery. That is, precision of statement and also of in- 
terpretation depends primarily on vocabulary mas- 
tery... There is always precisely the right word for 
the idea; in fact the right word must be at command if 
the idea is to be properly apprehended. Vocabulary 
mastery is therefore essential to both reading and 
composition. 
(a) A large vocabulary must be acquired. Choice 
of words is not possible unless the writer has a copi- 
ous supply from which to select those which he needs. 
An even and ready flow of thoughts is not possible 
unless words come rapidly. All teachers of reading 
understand that the pupil’s interpretation is crippled 
by the unfamiliar words. The embodied thought can- 
not be had unless the word functions so perfectly that 
the attention of the reader is wholly given to the con- 
tent. The teacher of composition finds that the most 
common difficulty of her pupils is not poverty of some- 
thing to say so much as poverty of means of expression 
—meagerness of vocabulary. The problem of the 
English teacher therefore, is primarily, and very 
largely, the problem of causing her pupils to amass a 
large vocabulary. This problem rests with all of the 
teachers of the school. The English teacher is chiefly 
concerned with the vocabulary of literary art, and 
ordinarily cannot care for the vocabularies of other 
departments, each of which employs an extensive set

  84 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of words peculiar to its subject matter. Thus the 
terminology of science will not be mastered unless the 
science teacher accepts the responsibility of securing 
this result. Likewise with mathematics, the vocational 
subjects, and history. History employs a large vocab- 
ulary of proper names whose mastery is necessary if 
the student is to get an intelligent understanding of 
the subject matter. From the standpoint of the learn- 
ing process as well as from that of the linguist words 
are precious. The world of thought is enormously ex- 
panded by the creation and use of words. It is little 
wonder that man for long ages thought of himself as 
absolutely distinct from the rest of the animal king- 
dom. Man lives in a world of words; the animals live 
in a world of things and memories of things. To those 
who can use words so as to influence the rest of us, we 
give society’s greatest rewards. ‘To the combinations 
of ideas which we have worked out in words we owe 
changes that have later been wrought out in things. 
In short, our civilization differs from primitive condi- 
tions chiefly because the economical methods of thought 
and action made possible by words have transformed 
our relation to the world and put at man’s disposal 
forces which could not have been discovered or mas- 
tered without the higher modes of abstract thought. 
(b) The vocabulary must be mastered as to its form. 
That is, the pupil must be trained to ready, accurate, 
and pleasing utterance. The mutilated word does not 
function properly either in process of expression or in 
interpretation. Pronunciation, enunciation, vocaliz- 
ing, have their psychological as well as their esthetic 
value. The word is a mode of behavior, and as such
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 85 
its meaning has become inextricably associated with 
its oralform. If sounds are omitted, syllables slurred, 
accent misplaced, wrong vocals sounded, and final con- 
sonants dropped, the real word with which the meaning 
is associated is not employed, but instead a mongrel 
whose content lacks definition and fullness. There 
is a logical necessity for greater attention to the ele- 
mentary matters of pronunciation and the musical 
quality of oral language. As indicated in an earlier 
paragraph this is largely a question of proper example 
on the part of the teachers and of habit formation. 
This problem also rests with the entire school faculty. 
It is only by patient and constant co-operation of all 
the teachers that proper habits may be established. 
But words must also be spelled correctly. Good 
spelling is not wholly a matter of taste, although it 
is required in good manners. Spelling is even more 
essential to facile reading than to composition. New 
words have a written form as well as an oral form, 
and no amount of previous training will relieve the 
teacher of the need of teaching their spelling. This 
also is a responsibility which departmental teachers 
will share. Spelling lessons are as necessary in mathe- 
matics, science and history classes of high school and 
college as in the elementary school. 
(ce) The vocabulary should be organized. In order 
to facilitate the choice of words as to shades of mean- 
ing and also to secure variety in composition, it is . 
profitable to group words on the basis of their common 
content, noting differences of meaning. This exercise 
will develop a lively consciousness of word values in 
addition to the increased command of vocabulary. It
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
will greatly increase precision of interpretation and 
statement, and equip the pupil with the primary es- 
sential of good style. 
(d) The vocabulary must be mastered as to its con- 
tent. It will be sufficient to say in this connection that 
the hasty and superficial thought usually given to the 
meaning of the new word is exceedingly wasteful. If 
the word has even a fraction of the logical value 
claimed for it, its meaning, or several meanings, are 
worthy of definite study and discussion. 
If the pupils have had no definite training in vocabu- 
lary, the foregoing program will impose a huge task 
upon the English teacher. But if they have been sys- 
tematically trained to acquire every new word with 
which they have met from their entrance in the pri- 
mary school, the task will not be formidable. Once 
the habit of word mastery is fastened upon the indivi- 
dual the teacher’s work is largely done. 
Sentence Construction 
The unit of the thought process is the judgment; the 
judgment is expressed in the sentence. Hence the sen- 
tence is the unit of composition, and accuracy of state- 
ment depends upon such construction of the sentence 
that the judgment is fully expressed, without a pos- 
sible misinterpretation. Training for sentence mak- 
ing will involve the study of those principles of gram- 
mar generally presented in the textbooks on rhetoric, 
which might well be supplemented by a consideration 
of the principles of definition and division as treated 
in logic; much study of the sentence structure of stand-
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 87 
ard authors for the purpose of determining the prin- 
ciples by which they are guided; and, chiefly, abundant 
practice. Sentence making is an art which comes like 
all arts—from long, patient, intelligent practice. The 
writer understands that most readers will pronounce 
these statements trite, and they would be unpardonable 
if most English teachers really attempted to do these 
things. In the first place, the study of principles is 
generally abstract and dogmatic. It is more effective 
to develop them as generalizations of the pupil’s ob- 
servation of the practice of trained writers and from 
his experience in experimental writing. In the sec- 
ond place, far more should be made of imitation. The 
teacher of English may well take a leaf from the peda- 
gogy of the Ancient Greeks. They have not been sur- 
passed as teachers of composition. Their method was 
based on the impulse of imitation. Their exercises 
consisted of writing from dictation of standard Greek 
prose and verse, followed by detailed comparison of 
the pupil’s effort with the model, discussion of errors, 
and rewriting. After the boys had become skilful in 
the mechanics of sentence making and had ‘‘caught’’ 
the diction of the author, they were set to the composi- 
tion of original efforts imitating the methods of their 
model. In the third place, art is ‘‘caught’’ not taught 
—caught in long, patient, intelligent practice. Much 
of the practice of the schools is neither long, patient, 
nor intelligent. Too generally the pupils are hurried 
on to paragraph writing and larger elements of dis- 
course. They are set to writing productions before 
they have learned to ‘‘play the scales.”? We feel that 
the poor English product of the high school at present 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
is sufficient evidence of the error of placing the empha- 
sis on paragraph writing. The paragraph is not the 
unit, and no matter how well the pupil conforms to the 
principles of paragraph writing, an orderly well bal- 
anced sequence of lame sentences can not become good 
English. The experimentation of recent years should 
satisfy all teachers that larger emphasis of the sen- 
tence and extensive practice in sentence writing will 
produce more satisfactory results. Besides, the prac- 
tice that is secured is too frequently of a perfunctory 
character. It does not bring out the deliberate effort 
of the pupil to solve a problem—the problem of giving 
the best possible form to judgment, consciously 
applying the principles of sentence writing which 
he has elaborated in personal study, and guided 
by an accepted model. Effective practice must 
do just these things, and in addition must be criti- 
cal. But the criticism should be made by the 
writer under the supervision of the teacher rather 
than by the teacher or other pupils. The teacher 
should be director of practice and criticism rather 
than critic of practice. The wise teacher will strive 
to develop in the pupil a critical attitude toward 
his own work, and train him in a method of testing it. 
In mathematics and science the student is taught a 
system of ‘‘checks’’ by means of which he may deter- 
mine for himself the accuracy of his results. The 
teacher of English may secure a like advantage by con- 
verting the principles of sentence construction into a 
set of ‘‘checks’’ which the pupil is trained to apply to 
his own work. Her task may be summarized in some 
such fashion as follows:
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 89 
(1) To give the pupil a clear conception of what 
constitutes a good sentence; 
(2) A model which he may follow; 
(3) The ambition to write good sentences; 
(4) A method of testing his work; 
(5) Opportunity for ample practice and personal 
conference with the teacher. 
With sentence writing mastered, it is not difficult to 
pass to the paragraph and larger exercises. The 
problem takes the form of organization of thought 
with such modification of the sentence unit as will se- 
cure variety within the unity of thought. 
Rapidity of the Language Function 
Facility of expression, we have said, depends upon 
three factors: accuracy of statement, rapidity of the 
language function, and attractiveness of expression. 
We have discussed the first factor, accuracy of state- 
ment, and dwelt at some length upon the importance, 
for both interpretation and expression, of the intimate 
mastery of a copious and well organized vocabulary, 
and of skill in sentence writing. Let us now consider 
the second condition of facility of expression—the 
rapidity of language processes. 
Rate of thinking and rate of word recall—First of all, 
thought cannot travel faster than the flow of words. 
In fact, mental tests employ the rate of word recall as 
a measure of mental ability. The volume of thought, 
then, will be conditioned by the rapidity with which 
words are recalled and perform their functions. In 
reading this is quite evident. The rate of reading, 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that is, of thought getting, is measured by the rapidity 
of recognition of words and the functioning of their 
associations. The rate of language processes is a mat- 
ter of practical importance. It is equally important 
in expressing thought. Every teacher is familiar with 
the interruption of thought processes which occurs 
when the pupil must give his attention to the recall of 
words and principles of grammatical construction. 
How is the rate of language functions determined, and 
how may greater rapidity be secured? In all mental 
processes there are individual differences. Some per- 
sons are so organized nervously that they react more 
rapidly than is possible for others. There are then 
inherited limitations beyond which it is not possible 
for the school to develop the pupil. But aside from 
these native limitations language processes are gov- 
erned by the laws of memory, and the principles 
governing memory processes will apply to language 
functions. Applying the principle of recall, the organ- 
ization of vocabulary into groups of words associated 
in meaning and which the pupils are trained to dis- 
tinguish as to shades of meaning, will accelerate the 
flow of words. Frequent repetition of these groups 
by calling a member and asking for its associates will 
be helpful. Rapid silent reading of properly graded 
material will serve the same purpose. Story telling 
is also of great value in this connection. Much may | 
be accomplished by speeding up the foregoing and 
other exercises. Rapid exercises in recall of oppo- 
sites, derivatives, correlative terms and the like give 
good results. A very common exercise of the same 
character is the requirement of a written news report
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 91 
in a ten minute limit. The rate of language process 
is determined by the familiarity of the individual with 
a large vocabulary, and development of speed will 
contribute to the end in view. The point to be em- 
phasized in this paragraph is the importance of work- 
ing for rapidity as well as accuracy. 
The Art of Interpretation 
Skill in getting the thought from the printed page 
and from oral discourse is conditioned first of all by 
the individual’s mastery of vocabulary. Nothing 
more need be said on this point after the emphasis 
given in the discussion in a former paragraph. A 
second condition is the individual’s power to analyze 
and synthesize the sentence—his readiness in conceiv- 
ing the grammatical relations involved in the sentence. 
We have also discussed this point. It is pertinent, 
however, to add a word in behalf of an almost lost art 
which formerly had great vogue in the schools. For- 
mal grammar has few friends in these days of the new 
pedagogy. If grammar could not be taught except as 
an abstract science dogmatically forced upon imma- 
ture minds and for no reason except for the alleged 
value of helping the learner to ‘‘speak and write cor- 
rectly,’’ the criticisms which have all but banished the 
subject from the schools could be justified. But gram- 
mar may be taught as a concrete subject, as a norma- 
tive science, and inductively. Taught thus it has great 
value in composition, especially as providing the 
checks for self-criticism. Grammar thus taught has 
even more value as a preparation for reading. To
-P-A-G-E-110
  92 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
read means to analyze and parse the sentence, and 
then to synthesize the elements of thought thus re- 
vealed into the judgment embodied within the sen- 
tence. The more rapidly, accurately and automati- 
cally this grammatical survey is made, the more it falls 
to the background of consciousness, and the more 
efficient the interpretative process. A revival of 
grammar with improved methods of teaching the sub- 
ject is very much to be desired as a means to better 
reading. 
Rightly conceiving mental images—A third condi- 
tion of efficient interpretation, especially of the printed 
page, is rightly conceiving the mental images em- 
ployed. This involves the training of imagination, a 
mental function which is largely ignored above the 
primary school. It is obvious that the grasp of the 
content of a selection dealing with a concrete subject 
makes the use of the pupil’s imagination necessary. 
The same necessity occurs in the reading of philosoph- 
ical matter. To be dynamic the concept must be 
clothed in some variety of concrete imagery, and to 
interpret an abtruse dissertation the reader’s mind 
must be resourceful in calling up an appropriate illus- 
trative imagery. This may be accomplished largely 
by getting the pupil into the right attitude toward the 
implied situation. He may be the story teller or the 
audience; the patient lecturer or the listener, or the 
participating characters. He must be led to frame in 
the picture, to graduate the lights which fall upon it, 
to participate. This reaction is especially necessary 
in the reading of poetry, in which the embodiment so 
frequently, as in the epic and the narrative poem, takes
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 93 
the form of a series of mental pictures. Much more 
may profitably be made of the dramatic impulse of the 
reader. 
Motor reaction to the selection—A fourth condition 
will be discussed in greater detail in connection with 
the consideration of appreciation; namely, word and 
motor reactions to the language. It is sufficient at 
this point merely to say that both are factors in the 
getting of the thought as well as in developing appre- 
ciation. The point of view of the author or speaker, 
his motor reaction to the language he employs, his 
emotional state, have much to do with the organization 
of his thought. They constitute the ‘‘logical uni- 
verse’’ within which his mind operates, the major 
premise of his thought. Clearly the reader must ap- 
proach as nearly as possible the same point of view 
and be moved by the same motor and feeling reactions 
if he is to follow in the author’s mental processes. 
Critical attitude toward the selection—The fifth con- 
dition is a method of attack. To read means more 
than to subject one’s mind to the play of the author’s 
words. To ‘‘take in’’ a speaker’s message implies 
more than passive surrender to his discourse. To 
read is to act, to attack, to react to the language of the 
page. The distinction is simple but of enormous sig- 
nificance. The passivity of the child in the primary 
class in which the pronouncing of words passes for 
reading has its parallel in the adult who ‘‘does’”’ the 
latest book in the same fashion in which one of Cook’s 
tourists does Hurope, or Young America sees his na- 
tive country from his racing car at fifty miles an hour. 
The American people consume countless tons of paper
-P-A-G-E-112
  94 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
but read very little. As evidence, note the quantity of 
matter over which they skim, the scare-heads of the 
metropolitan daily, and the short story. To read 
means to analyze, to synthesize, to reflect, to prove, to 
evaluate. This requires an active, questioning atti- 
tude, and a certain judicial disposition toward the 
matter under perusal. Obviously our schools must do 
more for our pupils than give them facility of vocabu- 
lary. In the subsequent pages certain outlines are 
given for the study of literary classics. These schemes 
are suggested not so much for their helpfulness in 
class study as because they offer a plan of training 
which will result in the development of a critical habit 
of mind in the pupils. The lesson plans suggested are 
not the only ones possible, and may not be the best 
which may be devised, but they have the merit of ex- 
ercising the student in a definite mode of attack upon 
that which he reads. The point which the writer 
wishes to make here is the importance of habituating 
the pupil to an active and systematic reaction to the 
press. A public which reads voluminously but non- 
critically is a dangerous public, ready material for 
mobs and revolutions. A public which reads criti- 
cally, categorically, which subjects every proposition 
to analysis, which reacts individually to what it reads, 
is a safe democracy in fact, whatever the form of the 
government. The school will accomplish much of this 
by training its pupils in literary analysis. 
Appreciation 
Possibly enough was said of the processes involved 
in the development of appreciation in a former chap-
-P-A-G-E-113
THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 95 
ter. The reader will recall that its tri-phasal charac- 
ter was pointed out: first, the element of enjoyment; 
second, the element of judgment, or the conviction of 
the intrinsic value of the object; third, the element of 
devotion, or disposition to encourage and defend. He 
will also recall that appreciation is a large factor in 
the making of personality, both through its recreative 
and its formative values; and that it is a sort of by- 
product of studies rather than a process or subject of 
direct attainment. It was explained as the product of 
the emotional experiences which accompany the motor 
responses brought out through the stimulation of ele- 
ments of form and content of studies. 
This review indicates the significance for life of 
literary appreciation. We are accustomed to think of 
books as the embodiment of the culture of the race 
and hence as the channels through which the humanity 
of the past generations is transmitted and transmuted 
into the personality of the readers of this generation. 
The ‘‘cultural values’’ of literature are derived for the 
pupil through the cultivation of his appreciation. In 
our analysis of educational values we gave literature 
the highest rank of all high school studies in the nur- 
ture of personality. This objective then is of equal 
importance to the teacher of English. 
Literary taste—Appreciation also involves what is 
called literary taste, or judgment of the relative value 
of literary material. Its importance to the pupil as 
a guide to what is worth reading outside of the school 
list is apparent. The school desires to make him in- 
dependent, to train him for self-direction. It is highly 
important that he shall acquire judgment of literary
-P-A-G-E-114
96 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
values that he may safely discriminate among the thou- 
sands of books thrust at him. In this relation, appre- 
ciation is a significant factor in that critical attitude 
for which we argued in the preceding chapter. 
The teacher will be quick to discern that apprecia- 
tion will react immediately upon the pupil’s applica- 
tion to his English studies. What one loves he strives 
to attain. Enjoyment of splendid language stimu- 
lates effort to use good language, makes the pupil more 
open to suggestion, quicker to imitate, more zealous 
in his efforts. 
Emotional experience—The statement made above of 
the mental processes involved in appreciation indi- 
cates the requirements as to method in developing lit- 
erary appreciation. It is secured as the product of 
the emotional experience of the pupil in his motor re- 
action to the form and content of the literature 
studied. This requires that the study of a selection 
shall be more than a mere logical exercise; that the 
study shall be so directed as to produce a definite 
motor reaction in the pupil. The corresponding emo- 
tional experience will accompany this motor reaction. 
The psychological basis of this proposition was ex- 
plained in the chapter on mental processes, and the 
illustrations were largely drawn from the study of lit- 
erature. It was pointed out there that words are a 
mode of behavior, sensed only by participating in that 
behavior with voice, posture, and action. A literary 
character also is a mode of behavior which one can 
truly realize only by participating in the situations 
and reactions which the character experienced. Like- 
wise with incidents, scenes, plots, situations. Hven a
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 97 
didactic essay is the behavior of the person who is 
teaching or lecturing, and its appreciation will be de- 
termined by the reader’s participation in that be- 
havior. In fact, all literature is dramatic, because it 
is human. For every reason a dramatic element or 
quality must be found in every selection, and the 
reader so situated that he is led naturally to partici- 
pate in such movement or attitude. 
Reaction to content—It was also pointed out in the 
definition referred to that there are reactions to con- 
tent, and that these are stimulated by the relation of 
the character and plot of the selection to the mood of 
the reader, and to his native impulses and his needs. 
This principle will guide the teacher in setting the 
time for presenting the production and in the method 
of introducing the pupils to the content. It is evi- 
dent that much of her thought must be given to devis- 
ing appropriate situations for securing the desired re- 
actions. Sometimes these occur naturally, but more 
often it is necessary to build a background of thought. 
The illustrations employed in the chapter on Mental 
Processes will make the application of this principle 
sufficiently clear. 
Summary 
The educational functions of the English courses are 
the most significant for all classes of students, and 
hence it is the most important subject in the secondary 
program. The objectives to be accomplished are (1) 
facility of expression, (2) power of interpretation, 
(3) appreciation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
98 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The high school English teacher will recognize that 
her work is a continuation of the program of the pre- 
ceding grades, and that her department must be a sort 
of hospital to which are brought the cripples of read- 
ing, spelling, writing and grammar courses of earlier 
years. 
In a real sense, English cannot be departmentalized. 
The English teacher may insist that her problems are 
necessarily shared by all the teachers who share her 
pupils. There should be close co-operation of all 
teachers of the pupil in perfecting his English. 
Oral and written English should have equal 
emphasis. 
Facility of expression is secured through (1) ac- 
curacy of statement, (2) rapidity of the language func- 
tion, and (3) attractiveness of expression. 
Accuracy of expression depends upon (1) the mas- 
tery of a copious vocabulary as to both form and mean- 
ing, and (2) skill in sentence construction. 
Rapidity of the language function is basically de- 
termined by the mental constitution of the child but 
may be improved by increased familiarity with a large 
vocabulary and by drill for speed. Attractiveness of 
expression is partly a matter of personality, but 
largely the result of painstaking practice after good 
models, and under stimulating criticism of a teacher 
who possesses literary ability. 
The art of interpretation is conditioned by several 
factors: vocabulary mastery, readiness in conceiving 
the grammatical relations involved in the sentence, 
rightly conceiving the mental imagery, the natural  
-P-A-G-E-117
THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH 99 
motor reaction to the selection, and an active attitude 
toward the meaning of the selection. 
The cultural values of literature are secured for the 
pupil through the cultivation of appreciation of books. 
The love of good books is of the most vital significance 
to the individual, and hence the development of lit- 
erary taste, or judgment of the relative value of liter- 
ary material, is the real objective in the literature 
courses.

CHAPTER V 
METHODS IN ENGLISH (Continued) 
Two phases of English instruction—As convention- 
ally organized the English work of the high school is 
presented in two phases: composition, including gram- 
mar and rhetoric, and literature, including the history 
of literature and the art of literary analysis or inter- 
pretation. Necessarily there must be some differenti- 
ation of these two phases of the English course, par- 
ticularly to bring out clearly the principles of gram- 
mar and rhetoric, but on the whole, experience shows 
that best results are secured by treating composition 
and literature as one subject, the composition prac- 
tice drawing upon the literary selections studied for 
models and themes, and being employed in turn as a 
means of more effective study of the classic. The ad- 
vantages of presenting English as a unified subject 
having two aspects rather than as a combination of 
two distinct and but slightly correlated courses, will 
be apparent as we proceed with the discussion in the 
following pages. 
Composition 
The objective on the side of composition and rhetoric 
is facility of expression as defined in the preceding 
chapter. This result will be secured in part through 
101

102 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the special instruction and practice required in the 
departmental classroom, and in part by the require- 
ment of good English, both oral and written, by the 
teachers of other subjects. It is not too much to say 
that this co-operation of the teachers in other depart- 
ments may contribute more to the desired end than the 
work of the teacher of English can accomplish if she 
fails to secure this co-operation. Possibly enough has 
been said of the importance of holding all members 
of the faculty responsible for the excellence of the 
language employed by their students. It will be re- 
called that this requirement was urged upon two 
grounds: upon the ground of its necessity in securing 
accurate thinking and clear concepts, as well as in 
furthering the interests of good English. The slogan 
should be, ‘‘Every teacher is a teacher of English.’’ 
Every teacher should hold his pupils rigidly respon- 
sible for accuracy of statement, for choice of the right 
word, for proper sentence construction, paragraphing, 
spelling, punctuation, and pronunciation. If other 
teachers to whom the pupil recites permit any careless- 
ness with reference to these matters, thus violating 
the most vital principle of habit formation, the labor of 
the special teacher will be largely wasted. It is well 
known that most of the errors of pupils are due to 
carelessness rather than to ignorance. The only 
remedy possible is proper habituation. It is the duty 
of the principal of the school to see that his pupils are 
under constant and even pressure for their best lan- 
guage. Again, the importance of the matter justifies 
us in calling attention once more to the responsibility 
of the teachers of content studies for the mastery of
-P-A-G-E-121
METHODS IN ENGLISH 103 
both the general and special vocabularies of their sub- 
jects. The pupil has no other opportunity for acquir- 
ing the latter, and much of the general vocabulary em- 
ployed in textbooks on science and mathematics will 
not be found in the material of the literature courses. 
It should be understood then that teachers of these 
subjects will make sure that the pupils thoroughly 
learn every new word as to pronunciation and spelling 
as well as to its meaning. 
The formal instruction in composition and rhetoric 
will include four lines of work: Vocabulary Mastery, 
Grammar, Rhetoric, and Composition Practice. 
Vocabulary mastery—Of these four, obviously the 
first is the most vital and at the same time the most 
neglected. More distress results from poverty of 
words than from poverty of ideas. The idea is not 
available for use even if it were possible for the mind 
to entertain it until the proper word is at hand for its 
communication. Fluency of thought is made possible 
by fluency of words. The first effort of the teacher 
therefore should be to give the pupil a large working 
vocabulary. Meanings, shades of meaning, deriva- 
tives, paronymous terms, must be carefully distin- 
guished and sufficient practice provided for fixing these 
distinctions in the speech habits of the student. It is 
as necessary to attend to details of pronunciation and 
spelling of these new words as with the vocabularies 
of the elementary school. It is also necessary to give 
attention to habits of enunciation. No matter how 
well the elementary teacher may have done her work, 
the insidious influence of the slovenly speech to which 
the pupil is constantly subjected will lead him to care- 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
lessness in enunciation. It is of the utmost conse- 
quence, especially to the pupil who will leave the high 
school to enter at once upon his vocation, that he shall 
be trained out of those many little faults of voice 
which seriously reduce one’s efficiency. At the least he 
should have his attention directed constantly to such 
defects, and should have a proper example in the well 
modulated voice and pure tones of his teacher. 
Strangely enough the American people are exceed- 
ingly sensitive to good voices and yet indifferent 
to the great value of a properly developed speak: 
ing voice. The high school could do nothing of more 
profit and pleasure to its pupils than to require 
of each an elementary course in voice culture. Cor- 
responding to this phase of oral speech training, equal 
attention should be given to the pupil’s penmanship 
and to the form of his paper work in general. The pu- 
pil has the right to be required to develop a legible 
style of writing. The teacher is inexcusable who 
passes him on without an honest effort to correct de- 
ficiencies in his handwriting. 
What to emphasize in grammar—It is sufficient to 
emphasize those elements of grammar that are vital 
to accurate sentence construction as they become 
necessary. There is no good reason for study of the 
subject as a science. Whatever values might be de- 
rived from such study will be more effectively secured 
in the learning of a foreign language. It will be found 
advisable to drill the pupils rather thoroughly on modi- 
fications—tense forms, auxiliaries, case and number 
forms of nouns and pronouns, and comparison of adjec- 
tives and adverbs. The rules of punctuation will re-
-P-A-G-E-123
METHODS IN ENGLISH 105 
quire re-study, and the position-value of words, 
phrases and clauses must have careful attention. The 
amount of time that should be devoted to these and 
other points of grammar will be determined by the 
deficiencies revealed in the composition work. 
How rhetoric should be introduced—It is likewise 
recommended that rhetoric be not ‘presented as a 
science, but that those principles be taught which are 
necessary to intelligent composition and self-criticism. 
The main emphasis should be laid on the organization 
of thought for expression. Naturally the principles of 
organization will be worked out with reference to the 
type of composition undertaken. With the subject 
matter properly analyzed and synthesized, the problem 
of the paragraph will present little difficulty. Unity, 
force and clearness will also be secured. Style is 
caught rather than taught—caught through conscious 
and unconscious imitation of models. It is advisable 
to work for style in this way. The study of principles 
of style has little value except for literary criticism, 
which obviously lies beyond the ability of the high 
school student. 
Conditions of profitable practice—To be really profit- 
able composition practice must satisfy three condi- 
tions, and since at least two of these are usually not 
secured we feel justified in emphasizing their 
importance at some length. These three condi- 
tions are: 
(1) The exercise must involve the pupil’s best 
effort ; 
(2) The writing must be done under the guidance of 
a conscious standard; 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
106 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
(3) There must be some practice, with painstaking 
criticism, personal conference, and rewriting. 
Motivation of the composition exercise—Hffective 
practice must involve the writer’s best effort, directed 
toward an accepted standard of excellence. Per- 
functory writing, merely at the command of authority, 
is worse than a waste of time. The first step in a 
practice exercise is the adequate motivation of the 
pupil. This can be accomplished in but one way,—to 
create a situation in which the pupil has 
(1) An audience, 
(2) To which he wants to say something, 
(3) Which he has to say, 
(4) In his best possible manner. 
Finding an audience—The teacher’s problem is to 
create the situation. First, the audience must be 
found. The poet may develop a fine frenzy with no 
particular reader in mind because in his imagination 
the whole world is held in wrapt attention. But the 
high school boy lives closer to earth. He must have a 
real and known audience. To him, speech is com- 
munication from speaker to hearer, and the normal 
boy finds no sufficient motive in speaking without some 
one to hear. The necessary audience must be found. 
It must be sympathetic, receptive, expectant. Under 
some circumstances the teacher herself may be a suf- 
ficient audience. Under others, particularly if the 
content comes out of the exclusive experience of the 
speaker, the class may satisfy the requirements. Occa- 
sionally, other classes or the school as a whole may 
be utilized. In written exercises the readers of the 
school paper will furnish a splendidly motivating 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  METHODS IN ENGLISH 107 
audience. The great value of letter writing as a form 
of practice is due to the fact that the communication 
goes to a sympathetic, expectant reader. However 
procured, an audience must be found, and it must be 
expectant of something new,—new information or old 
information in a new form. 
Desire to address the audience—In the second place, 
the writer must want to address the audience. This 
desire will follow their sympathy and expectancy if he 
has something of his own to say. The latter condition 
involves the selection of the theme. This will be 
determined in part by the range of the pupil’s experi- 
ence. Obviously thé teacher will not make the mistake 
of assigning a subject about which the pupil knows 
nothing, nor will she make the equally foolish blunder 
of asking him to discuss a subject about which his 
hearers know as much as himself. He must feel that 
his effort makes an original contribution to the audi- 
ience. That is, the audience to be addressed as well 
as the writer’s experience, must be considered in the 
selection of the theme. 
The desire to please—Again, the pupil’s motivation 
for expressing himself in his best form is determined 
by his attitude toward the audience. If this is so 
selected as to stimulate his desire for approval, or to 
please, he will anxiously strive to do his best. Thus 
the whole problem of motivation turns around the 
proper relating of the writer to an audience. This 
shifts the center of gravity largely beyond the choice 
of the themes, which generally commands most of the 
attention. But the psychology of the boy requires it. 
He finds neither sport nor profit in firing his rifle in
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the air. He finds some sport in firing at a target, but 
it takes live game to get the best out of him. 
Selection of proper models—The second step in a 
composition exercise is the selection of an appropriate 
model. Experience has taught us that both time and 
labor are conserved in the learning of any art by set- 
ting before the novice a standard of excellence within 
the range of his possible attainment. Such standard 
gives direction and definiteness to his effort, reveals his 
deficiencies, and suggests to him the nature of im- 
provement necessary. Modern pedagogy has seized 
upon this principle in devising objective standards 
for the measurement of the school product. The his- 
tory of standard authors reveals the same fact; 
namely, that very few invented their own styles, but 
that most of them ‘‘worked after’? adopted models 
whose styles they modified to suit personal characteris- 
tics and limitations. The same thing is true of paint- 
ers and musicians. Far more positive results are 
secured if the boy undertakes to describe an odd char- 
acter as Irving or Dickens would have done. Many of 
the editorial pages of our better newspapers and pe- 
riodicals afford exceilent models for profitable essay 
practice. Even the textbooks used by the pupils in 
their other subjects will be suggestive of proper pres- 
entation of a mechanical device or of a nature observ- 
ation. Many of the special newspaper correspondents 
offer valuable suggestions for young students. The 
teacher will find it easy to procure a sufficient variety 
of models for all kinds of subject matter and all types 
of writers to afford precisely the guidance needed. 
She will find this practice not only effective in develop-
-P-A-G-E-127
METHODS IN ENGLISH 109 
ing style, but equally helpful in correcting idiosyn- 
eracies of individual pupils. 
The value of good writing materials—There is a real 
value in providing the best writing materials for prac- 
tice work. If an assignment is worthy of the pupil’s 
effort, it is worthy of the best quality of paper and ink. 
Cheap materials have a bad suggestion. They beget 
slovenliness of thought. The best grade of materials 
suggests permanence of product and this stimulates 
effort. The penny pad and dull ink should be forbid- 
den. This applies to first drafts as well as to the final 
writing. Another object whose suggestion is harmful 
is the ubiquitous waste basket. It is next to impossi- 
ble for the boy to take seriously anything which he 
knows is destined to be tossed aside. Many of our 
teachers have found it wise to preserve at least to the 
end of the year all exercises, including first drafts as 
well as the finished papers. They find that pupils 
unconsciously take more care with work which they 
feel is to be permanent. It is entirely natural that 
they should react to such suggestion. 
Criticism of pupils’ exercises—The pupil has the 
right to have his work faithfully appraised, his merits 
recognized, and his errors indicated. This means that 
the composition exercises must be carefully criticized, 
and that the criticism must take account of excellence 
as well as weakness. It means also that errors shall 
be marked and treated in such way that the pupil may 
proceed intelligently to eliminate them in rewriting. 
This involves a vast deal of drudgery on the part of 
the teacher, but there is no escape from it. As a mat- 
ter of economy of time and stimulation as well, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  110 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the pupil should be called into personal conference on 
his exercises. A brief sympathetic interview with a 
suggestion as to improvements of the paper will se- 
cure a livelier response from the pupil and rapid de- 
crease of errors. The only feasible plan for relieving 
the load of the teacher is to employ a sufficient num- 
ber of assistants to enable her to section the class into 
small groups. The more personal the relation of critic 
and pupil can be made the more effective will be the 
criticism. 
The amount of rewriting should be governed by the 
attitude of the pupil and the excellence of his work. 
There will be little profit in further work on an exer- 
cise after it has become distasteful, or after the pupil 
has approached the limit of his ability. A very good 
rule is to continue the revision as long as the pupil 
is ambitious to improve this particular exercise pro- 
vided further improvement commensurate with the 
labor it would require, is possible. 
Oral composition—The foregoing applies to oral as 
well as to written composition. It may be well to re- 
mind the teacher again of the importance of much oral 
practice. From the practical point of view the ability 
to speak well is of more value than the ability to write 
well. Certainly we must express ourselves orally 
much oftener than we are required to write. The con- 
ventional value also is greater. The art of pleasing 
conversation, the ability to talk well, to tell a good 
story, opens the door to the most coveted recognition. 
This ability comes by training. There are some men- 
tal traits more favorable to such development than 
others, yet any pupil may be trained to speak as well
-P-A-G-E-129
METHODS IN ENGLISH 111 
as to write, and the ability to do so will be of ines- 
timable value. The principles which govern oral prac- 
tice are the same as in written composition. The pupil 
must have a sympathetic, expectant audience; some- 
thing of his own which he wants to contribute; the de- 
sire to impress his audience in a definite way. He 
should have good examples in his teachers and appro- 
priate models to guide him in his formal efforts. His 
efforts should be followed by a sympathetic, apprecia- 
tive criticism in personal conference. Abundant op- 
portunities for oral practice may be provided in the 
class exercises of other departments in the form of 
class discussions and individual reports. In the Eng- 
lish class he may be given practice in story telling, 
book reports, talks on topics drawn from his other 
studies, reports on current events, reports on his per- 
sonal enterprises, and sketches of prominent persons. 
The last exercise offers splendid opportunity for good 
composition-situations and, at the same time, for the 
acquisition on the part of the class of valuable infor- 
mation for which provision ordinarily is not made else- 
where in the school. It will be quite profitable to in- 
troduce the pupils in this manner to the leading per- 
sonalities in the present world of finance, industry, 
education, religion, science, art, sport, society, ete. 
The Study of Literature 
Two objectives—In the preceding chapter it was 
pointed out that the teaching of English has three 
objectives; namely, the facility of expression, the art 
of interpretation, and appreciation of the beautiful
-P-A-G-E-130
  112 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as portrayed in literary art. The first of these is real- 
ized principally in the composition phase of English. 
The second and third objectives are attained prin- 
cipally through the study of literary classics. How- 
ever, each phase of the subject contributes to the 
others. Skill in composition certainly develops power 
of interpretation and leads to the highest apprecia- 
tion of language as an art. On the other hand, the 
study of literary classics, as indicated in the former 
paragraphs, contributes directly to increased facility 
of expression. 
Literature is a conspicuous part of the history of 
man. It is one expression of man’s effort to raise his 
civilization to higher levels. It draws much of its sig- 
nificance for the reader of to-day as well as its content 
from the historical background upon which it rests 
and the social forces which gave it being. For this 
reason it is necessary for the student of literature to 
approach the subject with a proper conception of the 
historical setting. It is, of course, desirable for the 
student to have acquaintance with the lives of authors, 
and their place in the development of literature. But 
it is more vital to understand their connection with 
the current of thought and faith, with political and 
industrial movements, with the unfolding life of the 
nations. There should, therefore, be a close correla- 
tion of the course in literature with the course in 
history. 
Three requirements must be satisfied—In view of the 
two objectives which are primarily the business of the 
course in literature, the curriculum must be organized 
to satisfy these requirements. First, the material
-P-A-G-E-131
METHODS IN ENGLISH 113 
selected for study must represent all of the several 
types of literature in order that the pupil may acquire 
the method of interpretation appropriate to each. 
Second, these selections must be so made as to give a 
general introduction to literature as an aspect of 
human history. That is, the whole range of literature 
as to nations and periods of history must be repre- 
sented. Third, the selections must include the great 
masterpieces which are adapted to the abilities of 
high school pupils. It is beyond the province of this 
discussion to propose a program of studies other than 
to say, as a basis for the suggestions as to method 
which follow, that such program should represent the 
following literary types: 
Poetry. 
Narrative—Hpic, Metrical Romance, Ballad, Alle- 
gory. 
Descriptive Poetry. 
Lyric—Song, Ode, Sonnet. 
Dramatic—Tragedy, Comedy. 
Fiction. 
Essay. 
Oration. 
Narrative and Descriptive Prose. 
Suggested plans for study of literary classics—It is 
not possible within the compass of this volume to enter 
into a detailed discussion of methods of teaching these 
various types of literature, but the lesson plans out- 
lined below will show a method of attack which has 
proved quite satisfactory in developing appreciation 
and also in making the pupil independent in his own 
reading.

Summary 
Formal instruction in composition and rhetoric will 
include four lines of work: (1) vocabulary mastery, 
(2) grammar, (3) rhetoric, (4) composition practice. 
Special emphasis should be given to the acquisition of 
a copious vocabulary, to perfecting the speaking voice, 
to the quality of paper work, to those elements of 
grammar that are involved in sentence structure, and 
to the organization of the thought.
-P-A-G-E-137
  METHODS IN ENGLISH 119 
Three conditions are essential to effective composi- 
tion practice: (1) the pupil’s best effort, (2) the guid- 
ance of a conscious standard, (3) intelligent criticism 
and rewriting. Adequate motivation is provided in a 
situation in which the pupil has (1) an audience, (2) 
to which he wants to say something (3) which he has 
to say in (4) his best possible manner. This applies 
equally to oral and written composition. 
Much depends upon the wise selection of models. 
Criticism must take account of excellence as well 
as weakness. Errors must be treated in such way that 
the pupil will proceed intelligently to eliminate them 
in rewriting. As much as possible, the criticisms 
should be made in personal conference. 
The materials selected for study as literature should 
represent the several types of literary art. The whole 
range of literature as to nations and periods of history 
should be represented. The selections must include 
materials suitable to the level of ability and the 
spiritual and social development of high school pupils. 
The efficiency of class work will be greatly improved 
if the pupils are directed in a mode of attack which 
requires their critical activity. Their own analyses 
and syntheses and judgments as to value will prove of 
far greater worth than the teacher’s lectures, or the 
compilation of opinions of the professional critics.

CHAPTER VI 
THE TEACHING OF LATIN 
The Greek language and literature have so generally 
disappeared from the high school curriculum that the 
present discussion will be confined to Latin as the sole 
representative of ancient languages. The suggestions 
as to values and methods here proposed will apply with 
slight modifications to the teaching of Greek. 
Place in high school curriculum amply justified—Our 
analysis of educational values in the second chapter 
indicates that notwithstanding the present day popu- 
lar disfavor with which Latin is regarded, the place 
which this study has held in the secondary curriculum 
in the past is amply justified. The practical utility of 
masterful English is unquestioned; nor can the value 
of the proper study of Latin as a means to the mastery 
of the vernacular be more successfully questioned. 
English is a fluid tongue, loose in construction, and 
not well defined as to the meaning of words. Latin 
is a well defined tongue as regards both sentence con- 
struction and word meanings. It offers precisely that 
species of training needed as a corrective of the loose- 
ness inherent in our own language. It makes for pre- 
cision in use of words and proper regard for placing 
of words, phrases, and clauses in the construction of 
sentences. The critical study of any language, espe- 
121  
-P-A-G-E-140
122 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
cially one of strict construction, through a period of 
several years develops that mental attitude, of ines- 
timable value from the standpoint of logical thinking, 
which we call language consciousness. Ordinarily lan- 
guage consciousness passes over into language con- 
science. Another value of Latin which deserves in- 
creased consideration because of practical changes in 
the world grows out of the fact that the language of 
Ancient Rome is mother of the Romance languages as 
well as foster mother of English, and thus is the pro- 
genitor of the tongues that rule the earth. A mas- 
tery of Latin offers the most immediate approach to 
the modern tongues of most general usage. The disci- 
plines derived from the proper study of a foreign lan- 
guage, particularly of Latin, are not secured so well 
from any other source. Evidently the body of culture 
made available by a knowledge of the language of the 
present allied nations has values which the modern 
citizen can ill afford to miss. We may confidently ex- 
pect that the Latin language and literature will long 
continue to be a vital factor in public education. 
Latin cannot be truly a dead language as long as pa- 
triotic devotion to one’s country, dignity of citizen- 
ship, and a lofty sense of duty are fundamental in 
national character. 
Objectives in teaching Latin—In view of these pos- 
sible values we may state the objectives in the teach- 
ing of Latin to be: 
(1) The cultivation of language power, particularly 
the fullest command of English; 
(2) The training of the pupil in analytic-synthetic 
processes of thinking; 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
pn en ae THE TEACHING OF LATIN 123 
(8) The understanding of the Roman people and the 
essential elements of their civilization; 
(4) The acquisition of a body of knowledge, partic- 
ularly of those concepts which constitute the contribu- 
tion of the Roman people to modern civilization. 
Latin studied for English values—In the secondary 
school the first and second of these objectives are of 
most consequence, both as regards their immediate 
value and their adaptability to the high school mind. 
It will give the Latin teacher the best possible attitude 
toward her subject to say that she is primarily an Eng- 
lish teacher; that she is a teacher of English vocabu- 
lary, English grammar, and English composition; 
that her success as a teacher of Latin is to be measured 
primarily by her pupil’s mastery of English. She 
labors for mastery of Latin not for its own sake but 
as a means of reaching indirectly the same results 
which the English teacher strives to obtain directly. 
This attitude will determine her mode of attack and 
also points of emphasis. 
Method in Latin same as in English—In general, the 
method of Latin teaching is the method of the 
study of reading and literature in the English lan- 
guage. The mental process employed consists of: 
(1) Getting the thought, 
(2) Through the Latin language, involving 
(a) The mastery of vocabulary and 
(b) The mastery of grammar; 
(3) Expression of the thought thus acquired in good 
English. 
Compared with primary reading—This is the process 
employed by the primary pupil learning to read his
-P-A-G-E-142
  124 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
mother tongue and by the older student in his study of 
a literary classic. The pupil’s mind is focused on get- 
ting the thought from the printed page and giving it 
out in his own tongue to his audience. His considera- 
tion of vocabulary and grammar is governed solely by 
their use as a means of correct interpretation of the 
content. The more thoroughly he has mastered the 
words employed and the grammatical functions before 
attacking the sentence the more readily and accurately 
will he grasp the content. Thus in reading Latin as in 
reading English it is necessary in facilitating the read- 
ing process to have such mastery of vocabulary and 
grammar that they will be pushed into the background 
of consciousness. Of these two, vocabulary mastery 
is the more essential for the reason that for the most 
part grammar is a matter of mental process and there- 
fore is largely universal. It is the nature of the judg- 
ment process objectified in the sequence of the words 
composing the sentence. If the words are readily 
identified and interpreted, the mind will supply from 
its own nature most of the grammatical functions. 
The problem in Latin as in English, therefore, is 
largely reduced to the acquisition of an ample working 
vocabulary. Words are the tools of thought. With- 
out them little can be accomplished. With them other 
difficulties shrink to small proportions. The weakness 
of Latin teaching centers at this point. The wide- 
spread use of ‘‘ponies’’ is evidence of the pupil’s 
consciousness of this defect. It is not so much the 
sign of moral depravity as of psychological urgency. 
The easiest way to dispose of the interlinear is to 
make it unnecessary.
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE TEACHING OF LATIN 125 
Motor reaction to reading matter—There is a third 
condition of efficient Latin interpretation which is 
almost universally disregarded. The fundamental 
fact of language is that it is a form of behavior which 
results from the stimulations of the existing situation, 
and which has been conventionalized for the purpose 
of communication. The word orginally was not ‘‘the 
sign of am idea,’’ but rather the motor expression of 
the idea or of the sensation underlying the idea. 
When man discovered this uniformity of experience 
under given situations, he very readily adopted these 
motor responses as a means of making his experiences 
known to others. This principle applied to reading 
means that the content of language is apprehended in 
proportion as the reader makes the motor responses 
involved in the essential nature of words and construc- 
tions. It means that he must live again the experi- 
ences embodied in words and grammatical relations. 
The principle is very well stated in the old phrase 
“suiting action to words.’’ The primary teacher fully 
appreciates the significance of this fact, and makes 
constant use of it in teaching the beginner. The same 
thing is true in the work of the dramatic artist. The 
same values attach to the teaching of Latin. The oral 
reading of the Latin text is worth while provided the 
pupil is led to give such reading its proper dramatic 
quality. He must sense the action lying back of and 
involved in the incident portrayed. He should ‘‘live’’ 
the word at least to the extent of the innervation of 
the muscles which would be employed in actual pan- 
tomime. Thus does he come to get the full value of 
word and sentence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Learning the Latin word—The learning of the Latin 
word is a memory process. It involves the memoriz- 
ing of the oral and printed forms of the word in asso- 
ciation with the idea it represents. The English as- 
sociate, of course, enters into the combination in the 
same way that it enters into the definition of a more 
difficult English word. It is important that so far as 
possible the association between the Latin word and 
the idea be made both direct and natural. Whatever 
mode of presentation is employed, the fixing of the 
word in memory requires frequent and vigorous repe- 
tition. Drill is as necessary in the Latin class as in 
the primary reading class. In fact the problem and 
the process are the same throughout. The principle 
source of vocabulary weakness in Latin is the lack of 
sufficient drill to fix the words in mind. Any device 
found profitable in the primary school will, with slight 
modification, be found profitable in the high school 
Latin class.. Blackboard drill, word contests, and simi- 
lar devices have been found effective. The ‘‘flash 
method’’ has proved particularly valuable, making it 
possible to speed up the drills, and requiring the 
closest attention of the pupils. It is not amiss to re- 
mind the teacher of Latin, as in English, that pronun- 
ciation and spelling must go along with the meanings 
of new words. 
Connecting the Latin word with its English rela- 
tives—The study of the new Latin word should at all 
times involve the examination of English words pro- 
posed as equivalents to determine their relative fitness. 
This not only will facilitate the translation of Latin 
but will have a beneficial reaction on the English. A
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE TEACHING OF LATIN 127 
considerable portion of the time should also be given 
to the English derivatives of Latin words. It will 
prove a valuable contribution to our own language to 
work out systematically the word families which have 
developed from the mother word in the Latin. The 
teacher should bear in mind our proposition that she 
is first of all an English teacher. She will thus en- 
deavor to make the most of this opportunity for en- 
richment of the pupil’s vernacular. 
Professor Stout on elementary Latin—The following 
splendid discussion of the mastery of the vocabulary 
and forms of the Latin language by Professor 8. E. 
Stout of Indiana University is quoted by permission, 
from Bulletin No. 35 of the Department of Public In- 
struction of Indiana: ‘‘The learning of forms is pure 
memory work, and should be practically mastered in 
the first year of study. There is little hope that pupils 
will find pleasure or much profit in going on, to the 
study of the Latin authors until they have the forms 
pretty well mastered. 
““Study and drill and constant review are the only 
methods that can be employed. But the enterprising 
teacher will find means to direct the study, and to se- 
cure the drill and review by methods that are varied 
to arouse interest and prevent monotony. Any device 
that will assist pupils in memorizing is good pedagogy 
in this phase of the work. There is no way to avoid 
the requirement of sustained effort on the part of the 
pupil to commit the forms to memory, and it must be 
resolutely insisted upon. 
“But every method of making his efforts to acquire 
and retain and hold the forms at instant command
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
should be used. He should say sets of endings in a 
single breath; as, -us, -i, -um, -o, -orum, -is, -os, -is; 
and, -o or -m, -s -t, -mus, -tis, and -nt, spelling the last 
ending here for the sake of euphony. Much repetition 
must be secured, orally, on paper, at board. Individ- 
ual forms, cases, numbers, persons, genders, degrees, 
etc., may be demanded for instant answers to rapid 
questions. Correction of written work in the forms 
may be assigned to pupils who are behind as a 
further drill for them. The conjugations should be 
taught by stems, personal endings, and connecting 
vowels. Such observations as that neuters are alike 
in the nominative and accusative should be given to re- 
lieve the strain on the memory. Matches such as the 
old fashioned spelling matches may be arranged for 
answering questions in forms. The paradigms at the 
back of the book should be used for frequent extensive 
reviews. The instant command of forms and the ac- 
companying meaning can be won only as command of 
the multiplication table is acquired, by much rapid 
practice in saying them and writing them and using 
them. 
“Tn its earliest stages it is largely a matter of mem- 
ory, in its later stages its greatest demand is for judg- 
ment and discrimination. The vocabulary of the first 
and second years must of necessity be small because 
the other difficulties which confront the pupils in these 
two years are very great and cannot be postponed. 
All the forms and syntax can be taught the first year 
with a vocabulary of 500 to 800 words. It is not 
usually found practicable to extend this beyond 2,000 
to 2,500 words in the second year. So long as word-   
     
-P-A-G-E-147
THE TEACHING OF LATIN 129 
learning is mostly memory work, study and drill and 
constant review of the whole vocabulary previously 
taught must be systematically kept up. The methods 
and devices will be similar to those employed in the 
teaching of forms. 
“The learning of words is greatly facilitated by 
teaching pupils from the first to analyze words into 
their component parts. Every month should enable 
pupils to know without consulting the dictionary the 
meaning of a larger proportion of the new words met. 
There is no reason why a pupil who has had a few 
months of Latin should go to the vocabulary to find the 
meaning of reduco, produco, deduco, adduco, ete.; and 
second year students should apprehend the meaning of 
such English words as eligible, dirigible, paucity, ap- 
prehend, amiable, sinecure, involved, contravene, de- 
viate, apposite, without the use of the dictionary. 
““A great number of words which are but dimly 
grasped and never comfortably used by students who 
know no Latin, and which constantly occur in daily 
newspaper, magazine, story and school textbook, 
should by the study of Latin be made easy for students 
to grasp and retain. 
‘“‘A short time should be given in connection with 
every lesson to connecting the old and the new Latin 
words with English words. Pupils will constantly be 
delighted to discover the fine imagery that underlies 
so many of our common words, such as occur, define, 
insult, denude, resilient, insurrection, decadent, infant, 
repulse, defend, discuss, dismiss. The way will be 
opened for a fuller appreciation of all scientific and 
imaginative literature. The fact that such study must
-P-A-G-E-148
  130 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of necessity start from the root meaning of the word 
and trace the logical steps by which it acquired new 
meanings brings the Latin teacher an opportunity such 
as no other teacher ever has to give his pupils that 
mastery over words which is an absolute condition of 
progress in any study which is pursued in large part 
by reading.’’ 
Process of translation—The process of translation of 
a passage in a foreign language to the vernacular is 
precisely the same as that of reading an English selec- 
tion, with this difference; in reading the English, we 
get the content from the English language and hold it 
in mind giving it out in the same language form; in 
translation we get the thought from the foreign tongue 
and think it or express it in English. We substitute 
one set of symbols for another in translation, but we 
do this also in reading. The process is precisely the 
same as that involved in teaching an English selection 
employing words not found in the pupil’s working vo- 
cabulary. Method of translation, therefore, and 
method of reading are one and the same. 
First Year Latin 
The grammatical method—A number of methods of 
teaching Elementary Latin have been proposed at dif- 
ferent times and ardently championed. We shall 
briefly notice five of them. First, historically, is the 
Grammatical Method. This method approaches the 
subject by first learning the contents of the Latin gram- 
mar, that is, by storing the memory with declensions, 
conjugations, rules of syntax, etc. This is followed by
-P-A-G-E-149
THE TEACHING OF LATIN 131 
taking up the ‘‘Latin Reader,’’ a compilation of easy 
Latin stories, in the translation of which the pupil ac- 
quires his vocabulary and is drilled ad libitum on the 
applications of the grammar previously learned. This 
is heroic treatment, and while it is no pleasure excur- 
sion for weaklings, it ‘“‘works’’ as is demonstrated in 
the splendid classical scholarship of former genera- 
tions. The grammatical method is entirely psychologi- 
cal for adult minds; and while it does not recommend 
itself for use with the younger pupils and those of 
mediocre ability, it will be found satisfactory with 
gifted pupils and those of mental maturity. 
“Psychological” methods—In recent years the in- 
creasing attendance in secondary schools has made 
the student body less select, resulting in somewhat 
lowering the average mental ability of classes. This 
fact, together with the introduction of the elective prin- 
ciple, has compelled the Latin teacher to seek to make 
her subject more attractive and less difficult of study. 
Among the new methods devised which have proved 
to have merit are the Natural Method, the Psycho- 
logical Method, the Inductive Method, and the Graded 
Exercise Method. Some of these have appeared under 
other names. The Natural Method is based on the 
principle of imitation and proposes that the pupil shall 
learn Latin in the same way that the little child learns 
his mother tongue, that is, he shall learn to speak first 
words and then phrases, and then short sentences. 
Subsequently he will take up reading in the same 
manner, learning the grammar as it becomes necessary 
later on. This method is effective but requires a long 
period of time. The Psychological Method is based on 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  132 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the two principles of direct association of the word 
with the subject or action and of the unitary character 
of the sentence. It emphasizes an abundance of 
sensory experience. It is well adapted to young chil- 
dren but involves considerable duplication of experi- 
ence in the older classes and consequent waste of 
time. The Inductive Method makes its approach 
by taking up a classic such as Cesar’s ‘‘Com- 
mentaries’’ and proceeding by exhaustive analy- 
sis of sentence by sentence to acquire Cwxsar’s 
vocabulary and the elements of grammar. This 
is heroic treatment also and has not commended 
itself generally, because of the monotonous drudg- 
ery involved as handled by the average teacher. 
Employed by an inspiring teacher of large scholarship 
it is an excellent method. The Graded Exercise 
Method, embodied in the best known First Year Latin 
books, is based upon the cumulative principle and the 
learning of vocabulary and grammar together, begin- 
ning with easy sentence exercises and proceeding to 
exercises of greater length and involving a larger num- 
ber of words and more difficult elements of grammar. 
This method is favored by the majority of teachers and 
pupils, and if used with proper regard to the prin- 
ciples stated in the first half of this chapter, is entirely 
satisfactory. Itis a combination of the other methods, 
incorporating the best features of all, and thus is as 
well adapted to the average class as any we may hope 
to obtain. Quoting again from Bulletin No. 35 of the 
Indiana Department of Public Instruction: ‘‘If time 
can be had at the first meeting of the class, the intro- 
ductory lesson should be read with the class, and the
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE TEACHING OF LATIN 133 
pupils should practice pronouncing the Latin words 
used as examples in these sections. Sections 1-8 
should be learned by constant reference to them in the 
first weeks while pronunciation is being fixed. Stu- 
dents really learn their pronunciation from the teacher. 
A correct pronunciation adds greatly to the beauty of 
the language. It also introduces pupils in their first 
lesson to the most fundamental characteristic of the 
Roman people, the perfect reign of law among them. 
Be particularly careful to pronounce long vowels long 
in unaccented as well as in accented syllables, and to 
sound double consonants so that they will be heard 
twice distinctly. The proper time to fix in mind the 
correct pronunciation of a word correctly should be 
the first time it is met. A conscious effort to say the 
word correctly should be made at that time. If words 
are pronounced correctly, it will add little to the 
pupil’s burden to mark all long vowels in written work. 
It is well to have this done if the teacher is master of 
a correct pronunciation. If he is not, marking the 
long vowels grows more and more tedious, and is un- 
profitable. 
“From the beginning care should be taken not to 
allow any stiff and unnatural English to be used in 
translating from Latin into English. The sentence 
must first be thought through in the Latin way of 
expressing it, but if this is done aloud it must not be 
accepted as a translation into English. After the 
thought is thoroughly understood, it is then to be 
expressed exactly in our way of putting it. That is 
translation. Avoid the use of any one English word 
as an invariable translation for a Latin word.
-P-A-G-E-152
  134 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
‘Laborat’ may be ‘is at work,’ and should not 
always be ‘labors’; ‘videtur’ sometimes means ‘is 
seen’; the rather cumbrous ‘fatherland’ should not 
often be used to translate ‘patria’; and ‘agri’ should 
not invariably be ‘fields.’ Supply the articles and 
possessive pronouns necessary in English idiom. 
Use the progressive or emphatic form of the English 
verb if the context requires it. Use our possessive 
case for the genitive if it makes better English. Use 
the infinitive in English to express purpose. Use the 
English indicative without a ‘may, can, might, could, 
would, or should’ to translate the Latin subjunctive 
in indirect questions, result, casual, temporal, and 
many other kinds of clauses. Render ablatives abso- 
lute in English idiom. Do not hesitate to change an 
active construction in Latin into a passive construc- 
tion in English to preserve the correct emphasis, as 
is often necessary when the accusative stands first in 
the sentence. Let ‘Galba agricola’ sometimes become 
’ ‘Farmer Galba’ and not always remain ‘Galba the 
farmer.’ In translating connected discourse the 
translator must always be keenly aware of the require- 
ments of the context in choosing the terms and the 
phrasing to be used in rendering the original.’’ 
Study of the Classics 
In the first part of the chapter it was stated that 
the teaching of Latin involved the same mental proc- 
esses as the teaching of the reading and literature of 
the vernacular. The Graded Exercise Method sug- 
gested for the first year of Latin is an application to

    THE TEACHING OF LATIN 135 
that subject of the method employed in the teaching of 
reading, grammar, spelling and composition in the first 
six or seven grades of the elementary school. The 
method which secures the best values in the study of 
Latin Classics is an application of the plans outlined 
in the preceding chapter for the study of English 
Classics. The following suggestion for the treatment 
of a ‘‘chapter’’ of Cesar illustrates the method and the 
applications of the principle which we have emphasized 
as fundamental: 
Lesson Plan For a Chapter of Cesar 
1. What is the incident told in the chapter? 
(Corresponds to the ‘‘plot incident’’ in study of 
an English classic.) 
State the facts confirming opinion by citation of 
portion of text stating same. 
2. Who is the principal character in the action? 
What does he wish to accomplish? Why does he? 
What means does he employ? Why? By whom or 
what and by what means is he opposed? Why the 
opposition? What elements of character are dis- 
played by each of the actors? What do you think of 
these dispositions? 
Justify each answer by citations of text. 
Analyze constructions incidentally. 
3. The setting of the Incident. 
A. When did this event occur? How much time 
did it occupy? Time of day, month, season, 
ete. 
B. Where did it occur? Kind of place?
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
C. What picture would an artist draw in order to 
tell this story? 
4. What was the immediate outcome of the event? 
What effect did it have on the making of France? 
What effect has it had, if any, on us? What lesson 
if any, may we learn from it? 
The foregoing plan assumes that the pupils have 
been prepared for the lesson by the previous mastery 
of the vocabulary. If the teacher has constantly 
required the mastery of every Latin word in the First 
Year Course and in the preceding chapters in Cesar, 
it will be a simple task to select the new words in 
advance of the literary study of a chapter and have 
them out of the way. The pupils will be directed to 
go through the advanced selections and prepare a 
list of the unknown words with each of which they will 
proceed as follows: 
1. Pronounce the word. 
2. Spell it. 
3. Discuss its meaning and determine the real 
English equivalent. 
4, Prepare a list of and discuss English derivatives. 
5. Drill until recognition is instant. 
A very effective plan for the study of Cicero’s 
“Orations’’? may be evolved by a combination of the 
above as a plan for studying the incidents with the 
plan suggested for study of the English Essay. In the 
study of Vergil the plan for narrative poetry may be 
adapted and used with the omission of the reading of 
the production as a whole. This exercise will neces- 
sarily and properly conclude the study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
THE TEACHING OF LATIN 137 
Summary 
The place of Latin in the high school curriculum is 
amply justified by experience and on the grounds of 
educational theory. The value of the proper study of 
Latin as a means to the mastery of the vernacular can 
not be successfully questioned. 
In the secondary school the primary objectives in 
the study of Latin are: (1) the cultivation of language 
power, particularly the fullest command of English; 
(2) the training of the pupil in analytic-synthetie proe- 
esses of thinking. The best attitude of the Latin 
teacher is to assume that she is primarily an English 
teacher: that she is a teacher of English vocabulary, 
English grammar, English composition. 
In general the method in Latin is the same as in 
English. The mental process employed consists of (1) 
getting the thought (2) through the Latin language 
(involving mastery of vocabulary and grammar) and 
(3) expressing the thought thus acquired in good Eng- 
lish. This is essentially the process employed by the 
primary pupil in learning to read his mother tongue . 
and by the older student in his study of a literary 
classic. 
A condition of efficient interpretation of Latin, 
almost universally disregarded, is the necessity of 
proper motor reaction to the matter read as a means 
to the fullest apprehension of the content. The oral 
reading of the passage with true dramatic quality is 
strongly urged.
-P-A-G-E-156
138 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The key to facility in any foreign language is the 
learning of its vocabulary. In-so-far as possible the 
learning of the Latin vocabulary should be natural, 
that is, the association between the word and the idea 
should be direct. The principal source of vocabulary 
weakness in Latin is the lack of sufficient drill to fix 
the words in mind. 
A considerable portion of time should be given to 
questioning the relative fitness of English words pro- 
posed as equivalents of the Latin, and to the English 
derivatives from the Latin stock. 
The particular method to be employed in First Year 
Latin-should be selected with reference to the maturity 
of the students. Possibly the most practicable method 
is that known as the Graded Exercise Method, based 
on the cumulative principle. 
It is recommended that in the study of Latin Clas- 
sics the teacher follow in the main the plans outlined 
for the study of English Classics.

  CHAPTER VII 
MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 
It is desirable that the young teacher, in the begin- 
ning of her preparation for the teaching of modern 
languages, get a clear conception of the reasons for 
her undertaking. Why should they be taught in the 
American high school, or in the college for that mat- 
ter? Five values may be cited as affording sufficient 
reason to justify the expenditure of the time and 
money now devoted to instruction in modern foreign 
language. 
Commercial, preparatory and socializing values— 
Least of all is the so-called commercial value. This 
is the utility supposed to be realized by persons who 
employ the foreign languages in trade and interna- 
tional intercourse. However, the percentage of mod- 
ern language students who have occasion to employ 
their French, German or Spanish in business enter- 
prise or in any other situation which requires commun- 
ication in the foreign tongue is so exceedingly small 
that the commercial value may be dismissed from con- 
sideration. The second reason for French and Ger- 
man is the requirement of a fair reading knowledge 
of these languages in preparation for graduate and 
professional study in the universities. Third, modern 
language study has a certain peculiar socializing func- 
140 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
   MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 141 
tion. In the mastery of the language of a people one 
gets something of the ‘‘mind,’’ or mental attitude, of 
the people. He acquires something of their national 
point of view and of their mental processes. This 
mental reaction of language study has great signifi- 
cance in the resulting broadening of the sympathies 
and the growth of toleration for national peculiarities. 
A species of spiritual kinship is fostered which on oc- 
casion may become a stronger bond than blood-kinship. 
“‘The English speaking boy or girl of the New World 
may consider a knowledge of the Spanish language 
from three viewpoints. It may have for him the com- 
mercial value, of which we hear so much; it may have 
the cultural value, so seldom championed; it may have 
for him the most important value of the three, the so- 
called ‘political-social value’.’?! Mastery of the 
mother tongue makes one a member of his tribe or 
nation; mastery of foreign languages makes one a 
citizen of the world. 
Development of personality—The fourth value is 
closely connected with the third. The study of for- 
eign language, if it is thorough enough to secure facil- 
ity in the use of the language, is attended by a very 
definite growth of personality. Education is a process 
not so much of creating power as of releasing it. The 
youth comes to the school with certain potential abili- 
ties, that is, he comes with his powers ‘‘bottled up,’’ if 
we may employ such phrase, through want of the | 
means of adequate expression, and through repression 
by self-consciousness. The school does two things for 
him: it supplies to him a body of fact which becomes

the raw material to be employed in self-expression, and 
it also provides him with the means of self-expression 
in the form of methods of thought and language. In- 
crease of his language power enlarges the scope and 
facility of his thinking, thus freeing him from his 
most serious limitations. At the same time the 
mastery of language is accompanied by an increasing 
sense of personal worth, with a correlative freedom 
from self-consciousness and embarrassment. The in- 
dividual is relieved of those emotional conditions 
which have suppressed his latent abilities. His mental 
gears seem to fall into mesh, and his mental machinery 
springs into normal action, realizing in full his poten- 
tial power. Now, possibly the chief educational value 
of the study of foreign languages is the function of ~ 
language mastery in liberalizing the mind, or releas- 
ing the potential energies of mind and soul. It is 
what the older pedagogists very properly called ‘‘giv- 
ing the student spiritual freedom.’’ This contribution 
of itself affords a sufficient reason for including 
foreign language in the course of study. It needs to 
be emphasized, however, that this value is wholly con- 
tingent upon such efficiency of instruction as will lead 
the pupil really to acquire the new tongue as a vehicle 
of thought and expression. 
Cultural functions—The fifth value is also sometimes 
discussed under the head of cultural functions. It is 
clear that no other variety of study requires the same 
degree of controlled attention. Daily exercise of 
voluntary control of the mind through a term of years, 
holding it rigidly to a task which much of the time 
may have little or no appeal for the learner, faithfully 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 143 
inhibiting the tendency to run off after scores of 
attractive interests, secures a degree of self-control 
almost Spartan—a species of self-mastery of the ut- 
most value to the adult brain worker, and a kind of 
ability which many aspects of modern life tend to 
dissipate. The language teacher who succeeds in 
securing such steady and devoted application is per- 
forming a cardinal service in this one species of dis- 
cipline, which warrants unstinted recognition. Again, 
the process of translation involves an exacting analysis 
and synthesis of sentence form and content. This 
variety of practice in daily exercise throughout a 
period of several years of foreign-language study 
results in the fixation of a valuable mental habit. 
This, of itself, is also quite worth the teacher’s con- 
sideration. But of more significance than either of 
these disciplines is the increase of thinking ability 
secured through providing the mind with language 
sufficient in variety and extent to give adequate ex- 
pression to the stream of ideas. The attention of the 
reader is again directed to the discussion of the rela- 
tion of form to content in an earlier chapter. The 
principle there emphasized is that the idea cannot 
exist apart from the word with which the mind clothes 
it. The process of conception consists in the fusion 
of meaning and symbol into the mental product called 
concept. A concept is consciousness of a symbol plus 
the understanding of the meaning which it represents. 
The concept of electricity is the consciousness of 
the ‘‘something-or-other’’ whose real nature is to us 
unknown but which we call ‘‘electricity,’’? and which 
we understand functions in certain ascertained ways.
-P-A-G-E-162
144 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The symbolical element in the concept may be any 
concrete image, but ordinarily is a word or phrase. 
The idea thousand dollars may be the image of a stack 
of coin, or of a stack of bank notes, or it may be the 
image of the written expression, ‘‘$1000,’’ together 
with the consciousness of a more or less vague nature, 
that we mean something which will accomplish about 
so much in satisfying our wants. All thought above 
the simplest reactions to sense-perception involves the 
concept. That is, all thought above the simplest 
ideation is symbolical, and for the most part is possible 
only by means of language, which universally is the 
characteristically human symbol. In effect, this means 
that thought is limited to the scope and variety of 
language which one possesses, and that every enlarge- 
ment of language power involves the enlargement and 
perfecting of thinking ability. This is a value of 
which little is heard in teachers’ discussions of lan- 
guage teaching, yet from the standpoint of the psychol- 
ogist it is the most important contribution of language 
instruction to education. 
Teaching objectives—From these considerations it 
is clear that the primary objective in teaching a mod- 
ern foreign language is precisely the same as that in 
teaching the colloquial speech; namely, facility in the 
“use of the language as such. Thus, the object in learn- 
ing French is the ability to read, write and speak 
French effectively. Facility in the use of a language 
involves five elements of ability; thinking in the lan- 
guage, hearing in the language, speaking it, reading 
it, writing it. 
While the conditions which affect the method of
-P-A-G-E-163
MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 145 
reaching the objective in English teaching differ from 
the conditions involved in teaching a foreign language, 
the objectives are the same. The differences of 
method are occasioned by differences of starting point, 
maturity of the learner, time allotment, apperceptive 
material, and other similar conditions, not by differ- 
ence of objective. The aim of the English-speaking- 
reading-writing pupil who takes up German is to 
become able to hear, speak, read and write German 
in acquiring information and communicating his ideas, 
just as he has already learned to do by means of 
English. That is, the aim in teaching a foreign lan- 
guage is to make it ‘‘colloquial.’’? The more frankly 
the school recognizes this as the real aim in modern 
foreign language instruction, the more certainly such 
instruction will be made effective. All of the practical, 
cultural and disciplinary values discussed in the pre- 
ceding section will be realized in accomplishing this 
aim, and cannot be realized in any other manner. In 
brief, if a foreign language is not taught for the pur- 
pose here suggested, there seems to be really no good 
reason for teaching it at all. 
It is suggested frequently that the acquisition of the 
literary content is a primary objective. This may 
be granted in case of advanced work, but obviously 
does not apply in the first two or three years of instrue- 
tion, and scarcely at all in the high school. In fact, 
the accomplishment set out for the high school is 
necessary to undertaking anything of a definite char- 
acter with foreign literature. At the most, the 
national literature and history are of secondary con- 
sideration in the elementary courses, although all read-
-P-A-G-E-164
146 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing material should be drawn so far as possible from 
standard literature, just as in the making of school 
readers in English we have learned to draw the 
practice material from literary masterpieces. 
The Learning Process 
The steps involved in the learning of any language 
are two: first, learning the vocabulary; second, learn- 
ing to form words into sentences, and to understand 
sentences addressed to the learner. A third step, sub- 
sequently taken, consists in acquiring those abilities 
which constitute the art of discourse. But this last 
step cannot be taken until a relatively high degree of 
mastery has been attained. We are, therefore, con- 
cerned in the high school with the first two steps: 
learning the vocabulary, and learning the grammar; 
mastering words, and then learning how to organize 
words into sentences which convey our meaning with 
certainty, and to grasp the meaning of such groups of 
words when so organized. 
Vocabulary learning—The first step in time and 
importance is vocabulary learning. It is here that 
the battle of language mastery is won or lost. It is 
the word that is the bearer of the idea. Without the 
word there will ordinarily be no idea. A thought is 
a judgment, which in turn is a synthesis of concepts, 
asserting a degree of mutuality varying all the way 
from a slight similarity up to identity, or denying the 
existence of a common element. Sentence formation 
is identical in process. It is an orderly synthesis of 
words corresponding to the synthesis of ideas in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 147 
judgment expressed. Language consists of words 
which may be combined in certain definite ways to 
form discourse. All depends, therefore, on the supply 
of words at command, and the facility with which they 
function in consciousness. An address, ordinarily, is 
‘heard’? with understanding if all its vocabulary is 
‘‘working’’ in the mind of the hearer. Reading offers 
little difficulty to the pupil if ‘‘he knows the words.’’ 
The teacher has observed that the chief weakness of 
foreign language pupils in translation or composition 
is the famine of ‘‘words.’? The sensible primary 
teacher understands that her problem in teaching 
young children to read is to put her pupils in posses- 
sion of ‘‘the working vocabulary’’ in the shortest time. 
We pointed out in the chapter on Latin teaching that 
the problem of the teacher of Cesar or Cicero is 
essentially the same as that in the primary teaching of 
reading. Words, words, words! ‘‘Words are the 
handles to ideas.’? They are the tools with which we 
hear, read, speak and write; and our skill in these 
processes is exactly proportionate to the copiousness 
and thoroughness of our vocabulary. Learning a lan- 
guage begins in the learning of its vocabulary, consists 
chiefly in learning its vocabulary, continues the learn- 
ing of vocabulary, and is successful in proportion to 
the learning of its vocabulary. 
The association-complex—To learn a word consists 
in fixing in memory an association-complex compris- 
ing: (1) the Idea; (2) the Heard word; (3) the 
Uttered word; (4) the Seen word; (5) the Written 
word. These five elements are necessary to the ‘‘work- 
ing possession’’ of the word. They should be intro-
-P-A-G-E-166
  148 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
duced into the association as nearly simultaneously as 
possible, and should receive equal emphasis. The 
idea is at the center of the complex, and the four form 
elements are grouped around it. Each form element 
is related directly to the idea, and indirectly to the 
others through their mutual function as symbol of the 
idea. To this association-complex the English word 
may be added, but should be kept quite subordinate. 
If the idea has been brought into consciousness, it is 
unnecessary to introduce the English word. The only 
reason for injecting it into the lesson at all is to get 
the idea into consciousness as the center or core of 
the new association-complex. To be sure, it is desir- 
able and essential to have an active association of the 
English word and the foreign word, but this will be 
taken care of automatically by the mind through the 
mutual relations of the two words to the idea. It is 
by all means better to protect the pupil from having 
the new association-complex interrupted by thrusting 
the English equivalent into view. 
The incorporation of the ‘‘heard word’’ in the 
association-complex supplies the basis of the power to 
get the meaning of discourse addressed to the ear. 
In like manner the ‘‘uttered word’’ forms the basis of 
speech; the ‘‘seen word’’ the basis of reading; and 
the ‘‘written word’’ the basis of writing. Thus the 
four types of language activity are grounded in the 
nature of the association-complex. This means that 
all four of the form elements should be included in 
the complex. It is not, of course, possible in the lan- 
guage learning of the infant, but it is easily possible 
in the introduction to a secondary language.
-P-A-G-E-167
  MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 149 
Tt was advised above that the form elements in the 
association should be introduced as nearly simulta- 
neously as possible, and that they should receive equal 
emphasis. It might, for greater accuracy, be added 
that the ‘‘heard’’ and ‘‘uttered’’ words have a little 
closer, a rather warmer relation to the idea. They 
seem to be a little nearer kin. This may be due to the 
fact that they appear earlier in their development, 
but, whatever the reason, there seems to be a real 
advantage in presenting the spoken word first. This 
fact indicates the advantage of basing the foreign- 
language work on oral exercises rather than written. 
An association of ideas is formed by bringing the 
ideas together repeatedly in the same state of con- 
sciousness, until the corresponding pathway is firmly 
established in the brain. The strength of the asso- 
ciation depends upon the degree of attention with 
which the initial presentation is received and the fre- 
quency of repetition of the experience. The formula 
of word-learning is, Idea+ Heard word + Spoken 
word + Seen word + Written word, flashed into con- 
sciousness repeatedly under the white light of enthu- 
siasm and undivided attention. The primary teacher 
endeavors to get her pupils to think ‘‘box,’’ hear 
‘“box,’? say ‘‘box,’’ see ‘‘box,’’ and write ‘‘box’’ in 
the same moment of conscious experience, with the 
greatest enthusiasm and concentration of attention, 
and then to repeat this experience with vigor and 
such frequency that the association is permanently 
fixed as a habit of mind. This is precisely the process 
which the teacher of French must employ. She may 
use a slightly different mode of presentation, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  150 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
arouse the needed enthusiasm and attention in more 
grown-up fashion, but the mental process of associa- 
tion will be precisely the same. The psychology of 
the primary reading lesson and of the high school 
lesson in French are the same, the method of teaching 
must be the same, and the devices of the primary 
school may be carried over into the high school with 
decided advantage. 
Repetition is the key to habit-formation. Drill is 
the secret of vocabulary mastery. The most serious 
weakness of secondary teachers of language is their 
failure to drill their pupils sufficiently on the new 
vocabulary. They may appreciate the extent of this 
shortcoming by comparing the number of repetitions 
of the newly acquired word which they require, with 
the number of repetitions which are required of the 
young child in learning a new word. The secondary 
student memorizes more rapidly, to be sure, and his 
memory is possibly more retentive, but this advantage 
does not by any means enable him to make the new 
French phrase permanently his own with a half dozen 
repetitions. The best language teachers are vigorous 
drill masters. Many of the drill devices of the pri- 
mary school, especially color changes, dramatization, 
and the ‘‘flash card,’’? may be employed in the high 
school class with great profit. 
Another aspect of the psychology of language- 
learning is of vital significance to the teacher. The 
fundamental fact of language is that it is a mode of 
behavior which has become conventionalized for the 
purpose of communication, and that its meaning is
-P-A-G-E-169
MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 151 
comprehended to the extent that the individual is 
stimulated to the same experience. This principle 
applies equally in learning the new word, and in read- 
ing or translating the sentence. The full value of the 
word is impressed on the mind of the pupil to the 
extent that he is led to reproduce the motor experience 
with which the word is charged. This is the ground 
of the advantage of giving a dramatic touch to the 
language lesson. If ‘‘action is suited to the word,”’ 
if the imitative coloring of the word is brought out, 
its meaning will be richer and its retention more 
permanent. One of the greatest foreign language 
teachers based his method almost exclusively on this 
principle. His procedure was simple. He led his 
pupils in doing one thing after another, all saying in 
concert the thing they did as they did it. The boy 
opened the door, saying, ‘‘I opened the door.’? He 
threw the ball, saying, ‘‘I threw the ball.’? New words 
were written on the blackboard and in the notebooks at 
the end of the lesson. There was endless drill with as 
much variety in the performance as possible. Special 
attention was given to purity of pronunciation, and 
to spelling the written word. Brief instruction with 
reference to essential facts of grammar was given as 
needed. These were high school boys. At the end 
of twenty lessons, in one case, the pupils had a work- 
ing vocabulary of five hundred words which they 
understood, read, spoke, and wrote freely and accur- 
ately, and a splendid enthusiasm for the new language 
for the reason, as explained by a member of the class, 
that they were ‘‘getting the new language into their 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
bones.’’? Their progress and enthusiasm were due to 
the fact of basing the new vocabulary in an appro- 
priate motor experience. 
The same principle, also, obviously, applies to 
sentence-interpretation, and to the appreciation of 
formal discourse. A sentence is, in fact, a conven- 
tionalized bit of behavior, and its meaning is most 
fully conveyed as the corresponding motor experience 
is first stimulated. The child’s comprehension and 
appreciation of what he reads depends upon the ex- 
tent to which he participates in the motor experience, 
conventionalized in the sentences read. This is pre- 
cisely as true in reading in a foreign tongue as in the 
native speech. Possibly the necessity is even greater 
because of the element of strangeness and remoteness 
in the foreign idiom. This means that the new word, 
the difficult phrase, or idiom, the involved sentence, 
are readily and truly revealed by having the pupil 
‘fact them out.’? It means also that the incident in 
Cesar’s ‘‘Commentaries’’ and the section of Cicero’s 
oration against Cataline will assume ‘‘flesh and blood’? 
reality if the pupil approaches them with the advan- 
tage of the appropriate motor experience. 
The reader is referred again to the discussion of 
the psychology of appreciation in an early chapter, 
and reminded that enthusiasm for the lesson material 
of foreign-language lessons rests upon the same psy- 
chological basis. 
The grammar—The second step in language learn- 
ing is the mastery of its grammar. It is generally 
agreed that the best practice is to introduce the facts 
of grammar as they are needed in the progress of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 153 
lessons, beginning with the most general facts and 
proceeding gradually toward the more specialized. 
With the younger pupils these facts and principles 
should be presented inductively, but with maturer 
students they may be presented dogmatically. Since 
the sentence is conventionalized behavior, each gram- 
matical relation is a conventionalized bit of behavior, 
and is best comprehended if developed out of the 
underlying motor experience. This occurs naturally 
in the inductive approach, but may be done readily in 
connection with the dogmatic presentation. Modes, 
tenses, cases, numbers, persons, and adjective, adver- 
bial, conjunctive and prepositional relations, involve 
certain movements with which they should be con- 
cretely associated, and all forms representing such 
relations should be learned with such background of 
motor experience. 
Methods 
A working method may be readily formulated from 
the foregoing discussion of teaching objectives and 
learning processes. Three methods are in vogue: the 
Natural, the Grammar or Translation Method, and the 
Eclectic, the latter combining features of both the 
Natural and Grammar methods, but leaning strongly 
toward the former. The principal difference between 
the first and second is in (1) the inductive progressive 
introduction, in the Natural Method, of the grammar 
as needed in the progress of the lessons, and (2) the 
subordination or omission of the English equivalent 
in the association-complex. The Grammar Method
-P-A-G-E-172
  154 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
attaches greater importance to the phonetic and gram- 
matical system of the language, presenting it as a 
separate body of truth, from the application of which 
in exercises the pupil will acquire the necessary lan- 
guage habits. Another essential difference is that 
the Natural Method seeks to secure the direct associ- 
ation of the foreign word and the idea, without the 
mediation of the English word. It seeks to secure the 
reading of the foreign sentence without translation 
into the vernacular. The Grammar or Translation 
Method works for translation rather than reading. 
The difference is, essentially, in the relative promi- 
nence given to vocabulary mastery and learning of the 
grammar in the combination of the two elements of 
the learning process, and the prominence given to 
English. 
The eclectic method—The Eclectic Method, as the 
term implies, draws features from both of the older 
methods, being governed as to emphasis by the con- 
ditions of maturity, natural ability, and previous 
schooling of the particular class of pupils. It seeks to 
draw from all sources, ways and means of conforming 
to and promoting the learning processes outlined in 
the preceding section in the most direct and effective 
manner. Among its several features the following are 
most prominent: 
1. English is employed in the classroom as little 
as possible, being confined to the presentation of ideas 
which cannot be made clear in the foreign tongue be- 
eause of the limited attainments of the pupils. The 
recitations are conducted in the foreign tongue.
-P-A-G-E-173
  MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 155 
2. Reading and composition employ the direct associ- 
ation of the idea and the foreign word so far as feasi- 
ble. The pupil is permitted to resort to translation to 
and from English only when he is unable to make the 
direct association, or to clear up difficulties of inter- 
pretation. 
3. Since facility in the use of the new tongue is the 
objective, and the oral word is much ‘‘warmer’’ than 
the printed word, conversation will be emphasized. 
4. It is more profitable for the pupils to read a 
large amount of standard material, employing in class 
discussion the method of treatment proposed for 
the study of English classics, than to make an ex- 
haustive critical study of a small amount of exercise 
material. 
Summary 
Of the many reasons proposed to justify the place 
of the modern foreign languages in the secondary 
program, their commercial value, which ordinarily is 
ranked first, has the smallest value. Nor do their 
preparatory values in relation to graduate study apply 
to any considerable number of students. The learning 
of the foreign tongue as the means of access to the 
foreign literature can be of no great concern in the 
secondary school. 
The real justification, admitting certain elements of 
value in the directions above suggested, is twofold: 
(1) the broadening of the sympathies and development 
of toleration of national peculiarities—a species of 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
ee ee ee eee ERTS TTOR ENON AS ROR apa 
156 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
spiritual kinship making for world unity, which on 
occasion may become ,a stronger bond than blood- 
kinship; (2) the liberalizing of the mind or what the 
older pedagogists called ‘‘spiritual freedom.”’ 
The primary objective in teaching a modern foreign 
language is to give facility in the use of the language 
as such. 
Two steps are involved in the learning process: (1) 
learning the vocabulary, (2) learning to form words 
into sentences, and to understand sentences addressed 
to the learner. Learning the ‘‘art of discourse’’ is 
a step which can not be taken until a relatively high 
degree of mastery of the language has been attained. 
The battle in language learning is won or lost in 
the mastery of its vocabulary. 
To learn a word consists in fixing in memory an 
association-complex comprising (1) the Idea, (2) the 
Heard word, (3) the Spoken word, (4) the Seen word, 
(5) the Written word, with the Idea at the center of 
the complex. The formula for word learning is, 
Idea + Heard word+ Spoken word-+ Seen word + 
Written word, flashed into consciousness repeatedly, 
under the white light of enthusiasm and undivided 
attention. 
A dramatic touch should be given to the language 
lesson by having the pupil reproduce the motor ex- 
perience with which the word or the sentence is 
charged. 
The grammar of the language should be introduced 
as needed in the progress of the lessons. 
The ‘‘Kelectic Method’? is recommended for the 
secondary pupil. It combines the following factors:
-P-A-G-E-175
MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 157 
(1) the amount of English is reduced to the minimum, 
(2) direct association of the idea and the foreign word 
is made, (3) conversation is emphasized, (4) a large 
volume of material is read, employing the method of 
treatment proposed for the study of English classics.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
The field of history—Bernheim defines history as 
“‘the science of the development of men in their ac- 
tivity as social beings.’’ De Garmo has said, ‘‘Fun- 
damentally, history is the story of man and all that 
favors or hinders his progress in well-being—the in- 
fluences of his environment whether natural or human, 
that have affected him, the responses he has made to 
the stimuli of this environment, the institutions he has 
devised to fix and transmit his advances; in short, the 
whole account of his efforts, mishaps, failures, and suc- 
cesses as a social being.’? We may express the same 
conception by saying that history is the story of the 
development of civilization, of ‘‘how things have come 
to be.’’ For the purpose of this discussion we may say 
that civilization is the system of knowledge, attitudes, 
skills and instrumentalities which constitute the 
means of satisfying the human wants. These are con- 
ventionally reduced to seven groups: The Biological, 
Economic, Intellectual, Social, Political, Ethical, and 
4fsthetic. The satisfaction of these wants may be 
considered as to volume, variety, and refinement, or 
development above the brute level. The growth of the 
volume of means of human satisfaction, the develop- 
158 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 159 
ment of new devices and agencies for securing satis- 
faction, and the general total uplift of man’s activities 
above the primitive mode, constitute the subject matter 
of history. 
Human progress three-dimensional—Since method in 
teaching history is so largely governed by the under- 
lying conception of the nature of history, it is worth 
while to consider the foregoing conception a little 
further. As a biological creature, man requires food, 
shelter, clothing, health and wholesome propagation. 
The evidence at hand leads us to conclude that in the 
beginning he satisfied these needs in a very crude and 
inadequate fashion. Like other animals, he subsisted 
on wild articles of food, eaten as procured; he found 
shelter as the beasts of field and forest; he was clad in 
nature’s garb, and his domestic relations were akin to 
those of the brute life about him. Little by little he 
learned to make use of additional articles of food, to 
store up the surplus for the ‘‘lean season,’’ to domesti- 
cate animals and plants in order to secure ample sup- 
plies, to cook, and then to eat with the ceremonialism 
which insured increasing self-restraint, mutual con- 
sideration, and fellowship. The perfecting of proc- 
esses of food production, of manufacture of new food 
materials into an increasing variety of convenient and 
attractive forms, of balancing the ration and of facili- 
tating digestion, and of refining the accessories and art 
of eating, goes on continually. Thus there is a three- 
dimensional improvement going on in the matter of 
feeding the human race; increasing adequacy, variety, 
and refinement—all making for the production of a 
finer type of human life.
-P-A-G-E-178
160 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
History considers all aspects of human life—The same 
improvement is traceable in the other biological factors 
of housing, clothing, sanitation, hygiene and propaga- 
tion. In the same manner we may trace man’s im- 
provement in the processes of acquiring wealth. 
Industrial progress is a three-dimensional fact. The 
intellectual satisfactions have grown from the weird 
tales and witchcraft of the ancient to modern scholar- 
ship; educational agencies and processes have devel~ 
oped from the limited, monotonous and childish lore 
of the folk, transmitted in camp-fire tale and tribal 
ceremony, to highly organized systems of schools, 
libraries, forums, press, and multiform agencies, 
reaching all sorts and kinds of people, revealing the 
secret of all fields of truth, and ever developing new 
and marvelous skills.) How far man has risen above 
and beyond his primitive forbears in his provision for 
education! The same upward, outward and onward 
movement is seen in his religious and ethical life; in . 
his political life; in his system of agencies and prac- 
tices for securing fellowship; and in his pleasure life. 
The business of the study of history is to see how the 
present life of man in all of these aspects has grown 
up out of its beginnings with his primitive ancestors. 
Getting the true perspective—The rise of civilization 
has been irregular. First one and then another of 
these seven factors in human life has become pre- 
dominant. At one time the outstanding advance has 
been economic; again it has been religious; again 
intellectual. Since these factors are interdependent, 
each modifying the others, it follows that in one period 
of history political change will become the determining

factor, influencing progress in the other departments 
of activity. At another period, the economic struggle 
will be the determining factor ; at another, the religious 
advance will govern other social movements; at an- 
other, the esthetic progress may be the overshadowing 
influence. The teacher must keep in mind this kaleido- 
scopic character of his story. He must avoid the fre- 
quent error of attempting to explain all human history 
in terms of economic struggle, or of class conflict, or of 
educational advance, or of faith, or any other one 
factor. Man is a seven-strand creature, and his 
history is a many-colored fabric, no one color of which 
may be supposed to give dominant tone to the scheme 
as a whole. Referring to the mistake of the student 
who endeavors to explain all human affairs with 
reference to a supposed single fundamental element, 
Dr. Butler says in his introduction to Johnson’s 
“Teaching of History’’: ‘‘For more than a genera- 
tion past there has been a strong and steadily growing 
tendency to interpret the facts of history as the succes- 
sive sequences in a chain of economic causation. It 
has been stoutly held and taught that the actions of 
men and of nations are to be explained as the effects 
of purely economic causes. To accept this, however, 
as occupying anything more than a subordinate and 
a secondary place in the study of history, is to close 
one’s eyes to the most obvious facts of human ex- 
perience. No small part of the life of individuals and 
of nations is devoted to courses of action and to 
policies which are in direct conflict with men’s obvious 
economic interests, but which are pursued because of 
belief in some principle, because of adherence to some    
-P-A-G-E-180
     
  162 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ideal, because of faith in something unseen and eternal. 
The scholarly and the true interpretation of history 
is to view it as the record of the social, the moral, and 
the intellectual education of man, with economic forces 
and laws playing a constant but a secondary part.’’ 
It is well also to utter a word of caution as to the 
error of attempting a purely idealistic interpretation 
of historical facts, or to the corresponding error of 
attempting a materialistic explanation. The current 
of human affairs is in one period determined by ideas 
and beliefs; at another period, or in another country, 
climatic conditions, topography, the supply of natural 
resources, and other physical causes may exert the 
larger influence. There are two kinds of forces at 
work on human society, personal and physical. At 
one time the personal forces are the most conspicuous ; 
at another the physical; at another they work together. 
This variation must be observed by the student and 
his interpretation governed accordingly. 
Portrays the whole of human life—The science of 
history comprehends in its scope the whole of man’s 
social life, the whole round of his effort to relate him- 
self to the conditions of life. Quoting from Bourne’s 
“The Teaching of History and Civies’”?: ‘‘From 
even these fragmentary notes of the growth of the 
idea of history it is easy to see that history, or histor- 
ical writing, has varied in form and in motive and in 
characteristic interests from age to age, being pro- 
foundly affected by the contemporary state of civiliza- 
tion. It is also plain that at present history, if it be 
understood in no narrow sense, must comprehend those 
phases of human experience which one great thinker    
  
-P-A-G-E-181
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 163 
after another has brought within its pale. It must 
remember the unity of mankind, although it is not 
expected to explore with such painstaking zeal the 
stagnant civilizations of the Hast, and though it may 
leave to anthropology or ethnography the life of the 
African or Australian savage.’’ 
Educational Values in History 
In the analysis of educational values of high school 
studies in an earlier chapter it was claimed for history 
that it possesses high value as an instrumental study, 
particularly in relation to literature, economics and 
socialism. Literary interpretation is possible only 
in light of the circumstances and conditions under 
which the selection was produced. These contributing 
factors are portrayed in the history of the period. 
The political and economic sciences are dependent for 
data very largely upon the facts set forth in historical 
survey. Both literary criticism and interpretation, 
as well as political science, are grounded in historical 
scholarship. The same relation is involved in edu- 
cational theory and moral science. To all of these 
branches of learning history offers a valuable intro- 
duction and is necessary as the chief source of data. 
The conventional value of history, of course, is 
high. It is impossible to think of culture apart from 
that insight into relative merits which comes of 
historical scholarship. Its necessity to intelligent 
citizenship is equally great. In a democratic society 
the ballot presupposes not only a knowledge of prob- 
lems to be solved and the solutions proposed, but also  
-P-A-G-E-182
  1 
| 
164 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the power of critical judgment which can be derived 
only from an understanding of the solutions previously 
attempted and their outeome. To vote intelligently 
upon a proposed policy with reference to the govern- 
ment of our insular possessions requires a knowledge 
of the colonial policies of other nations in the past 
together with their successes and failures. Exact 
knowledge of conditions is necessary in the effort of 
the common people to solve their own industrial, 
financial, educational and political problems. In all 
of these problems a wise ballot is possible only under 
the illumination of extensive historical knowledge. An 
active consciousness on the part of the American 
people of the social upheaval connected with great wars 
in the past, and of our own experience with army con- 
tractors and the profiteering class in the Civil War 
period might have prevented much extravagance in 
recent years. Human nature is fairly constant, and 
man’s reaction to similar conditions is practically 
uniform through all time and everywhere. The curve 
of human conduct is reasonably calculable. A gener- 
ally diffused knowledge of the social disintegration 
following the French Revolution might have saved the 
present generation from many of its mistakes. The 
history of civilization in southern Hurope certainly 
throws sufficient light on the operation of the several 
social factors to afford guidance to-day in the co- 
ordination of the forces at work in modern society. 
History is a sort of mirror in which men to-day may 
see reflected the outcome of all current movements and 
social philosophies, if allowed to run their course. 
The same uniformity of human nature which leads
-P-A-G-E-183
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 165 
man to make the same reactions over and over also 
causes him to make the same mistakes again and again 
unless restrained by the lessons of past experience. 
The most valuable contribution which the school can 
make to citizenship is to develop the civic wisdom 
which results from a widely diffused and abundant 
knowledge of the past experience of nations. 
When we turn to the cultural influences of history 
the case is even more apparent. The emotional ex- 
periences of the pupil awakened in him as he traces 
the struggle of his ancestors for the betterment of 
their lives, as he pictures again the price paid by his 
fathers and grandfathers for the blessings of liberty, 
a stable government, an ordered society; the thrill of 
pride which he must experience as he reviews the 
heroism of the nation’s great soldiers, the courage of 
the pioneer, the vision of the statesman who established 
national institutions; the emotion with which he con- 
templates how greatly he is a personal debtor to the 
vast army of men and women who have gone before 
and given to him ready at hand the discoveries of 
science, the inventions of genius, the dreams ‘of poets, 
the insight of artists, and the wealth of foresight and 
industry—this rich emotional experience as he lives 
over in imagination the life of the race which has borne 
the torch of civilization up to his day, has a spiritual 
value beyond computation. As he views the struggles 
of men of all times and places to secure those same 
things which we most desire, his sympathies are 
broadened; he grows tolerant of the differences which 
he sees are after all small when compared to the great 
unities of human life. A catholicity of spirit, a broad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  
166 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ening of his mental horizon, a spirit of tolerance and 
co-operation, are first fruits of these deeper, vitalized 
insights into the historical past. Such sentiment and 
liberalizing of mind make the individual a citizen of 
the world, sympathetically intelligent with social 
movements everywhere, a participant in all of those 
movements, and capable of regulating his own life in 
harmony with world conditions. Such an attitude of 
mind is fundamental in a democratic society. Chester- 
ton says that the first principle of democracy is this: 
“<The essential things in men are the things they hold 
in common, not the things they hold separately.’’ 
This unifying of the individual through charity of 
mind, breadth of insight, toleration, and the spirit of 
co-operation with the whole human race, past and 
present, is the beginning of true democracy. Chester- 
ton also challenges the frequently expressed fear that 
over-much study of the past is in some manner inimical 
to the growth of democracy. In his volume on 
‘“‘Orthodoxy’’ he says, ‘‘But there is one thing that I 
have never from my youth up been able to understand, 
where people got the idea that democracy was in some 
way opposed to tradition. It is obvious that tradition 
is only democracy extended through time. It is trust- 
ing to a consensus of common human voices rather 
than to some isolated or arbitrary record. The man 
who quoted some German historian against the tradi- 
tion of the Catholic Church, for instance, is strictly 
appealing to aristocracy. He is appealing to the 
superiority of one expert against the awful authority 
of a mob. It is quite easy to see why a legend is 
treated and ought to be treated, more respectfully
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 167 
than a book of history. The legend is generally made 
by the majority in the village who are sane. The book 
is generally written by the one man in the village who 
is mad. Those who urge against tradition, that men 
in the past were ignorant, may go and urge it at the 
Carlton Club, along with the statement that voters in 
the slums are ignorant. It will not do for us. If 
we attach great importance to the opinion of ordinary 
men in great unanimity when we are dealing with 
daily matters, there is no reason why we should dis- 
regard it when we are dealing with history or fable. 
Tradition may be defined as an extension of the 
franchise. Tradition means giving votes to the most 
of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of 
the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to the small 
and arrogant oligarchy/of those who merely happen 
to be walking about. All democrats object to men 
being disqualified by the accident of death. Democ- 
racy tells us not to neglect a good man’s opinion, even 
if he is our groom; tradition asks us not to neglect a 
good man’s opinion, even if he is our father.”’ 
German pedagogy has made much of the moral 
value of history, but with the thought of using it as 
an introduction to or in support of particular ethical 
theories. Such interpretation is very certain to do 
violence to historic fact and to lose the very end de- 
sired. History has exceedingly high moral worth if 
it is taught as Bourne advises, merely to unfold truth- 
fully the whole of human life before the student. 
“History will have for the pupil, as for the citizen, 
its greatest moral value when it remains faithful to 
the comprehensive conception of its work which has
-P-A-G-E-186
  { 
168 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
been gradually built up by those who from Herodotus 
to Ranke have spent their lives in its study, when it 
seeks to unfold before the growing imagination of 
the student human experience in its marvelous vari- 
ety, political, intellectual, religious, social, and eco- 
nomic. It is such historical knowledge, as Bernheim 
points out, which will be the best support of public 
spirit against the attacks of a hollow selfishness which 
is pressing in on all sides for the mastery.’’ 
The study of history also offers a variety of disci- 
pline not secured in other subjects. Man is described 
as a rational historical animal. He reasons out his 
course of present and future action with reference to 
the successes and failures in both his personal past ex- 
perience and the past experience of the race. The 
more efficiently he thinks out his conduct the higher his 
ethical development. The emphasis of causal rela- 
tions in history-study not only affords the necessary 
body of data, but encourages the habit of rational fore- 
thought. This habit of mentally clearing the way for 
pending action by systematic consideration of the im- 
plications of pertinent experience is of inestimable 
value, logically and ethically. It at the same time 
provides the basis of scientific method and develops the 
quality of prudence, the essential element in wisdom. 
It was also pointed out in a preceding paragraph that 
a uniformity exists in human life as in physical nature. 
There is possible a science of human affairs. There 
is, therefore, possible a scientific method of thought 
with reference to historical data. The historical 
method is recognized in logic as a distinct form of 
inductive science. No other study in the curriculum
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 169 
affords exercise of the mind in this particular process. 
However, historical science differs from the natural 
sciences in one other important particular, namely, the 
presence of a large contingent factor. This character- 
istic has been well pointed out by De Garmo in his 
‘‘Principles of Secondary Education,’’ the volume on 
“‘Studies,’? from which we quote at some length: 
‘‘History is pre-eminently the realm of the contingent, that 
is, of a class of causes and effects which, unlike those revealed 
by natural science, do not follow the invariable order of 
natural law, but are influenced and sometimes determined by 
circumstances that might have been otherwise. This does not 
mean that no law can be observed among these phenomena, 
for that would not be true. Yet these laws lack the apodic- 
tie certainty of those realms of science with which the will 
of man has nothing to do. For illustration, the result of a 
battle often depends not upon numbers and equipments alone, 
but upon accidents of field and flood, the unforeseen presence 
of natural obstacles, like the sunken road at Waterloo, the 
freshness or weariness of the troops, their food and ebb of 
courage, the genius, stupidity, jealousy, caprice, intelligence, 
or information of the officers. The mental attitude of a peo- 
ple is generally influenced if not determined by their eco- 
nomic situation; often by prejudices engendered by the quar- 
rels, sometimes personal, of party leaders, and not seldom in 
the past by differences in religious opinions and practices, 
whereby men not unfrequently lost their natural reason. In 
short, historical results are a resultant of forces both natural 
and human, wherein the accidents of the one and the defects 
of the other play their part.’’ 
The study of history also affords exercise of the 
reconstructive imagination, a mental function of large
-P-A-G-E-188
  170 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
practical significance, and is of equal value with the 
natural sciences in cultivating the power of logical 
memory. 
Objectives 
Applying the foregoing discussion of values, the 
teacher of history will set up three objectives: 
1. To secure that acquaintance with the origin 
of the elements of society which will enable the student 
to understand the world of human activities. This is 
the primary object, the acquisition of the largest pos- 
sible body of knowledge of historical fact. 
2. The development of insight into the signifi- 
eance of this body of fact as revealing historical ten- 
dencies, and the development of skill in tracing causal 
connections between past events and between past ex- 
perience and future situations. 
3. The cultivation of certain attitudes which go 
to determine the individual’s social disposition, or to 
constitute what is called good citizenship. Prominent 
among these attitudes are a broad sympathy with all 
classes of people; a spirit of toleration as to differ- 
ences of dogma, parties and sects; a spirit of co- 
operation; good will—the disposition to wish every- 
one well; and a sense of personal obligation to repay 
to society in kind the service received. This sense 
of obligation is awakened by revealing to the pupil 
the cost in labor, privation, and suffering of the privi- 
leges which he enjoys; by helping him to see that the 
toil of the pioneer, the sacrifices of the soldier, the 
thrift and industry of ancestors, constitute the major
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 171 
part of the price paid to secure to him the advantages 
which he enjoys as a member of modern society. This 
contribution is as valuable to him as if made solely 
for his benefit. This makes him in debt, and since he 
cannot repay those who have served him, he can satisfy 
his obligation only by passing on his heritage unim- 
paired and increased to the next generation. The 
school can accomplish nothing more valuable to so- 
ciety than to implant in the heart of the individual 
the realization that he is the channel through which 
the achievements of civilization are handed on to the 
future, and the feeling that the obligation thus im- 
posed on him cannot in honor be lightly treated. 
The Learning Process 
The method of teaching history is governed by the 
learning process involved in the study of history, and 
in historical research. The student passes through 
three successive steps. The first is: 
(1) The acquisition of a body of fact. This is ac- 
complished by: 
(a) Discovery of an outstanding fact or group 
of facts, definitely ascertained either by per- 
sonal observation or from competent authority ; 
(b) Conceiving the situation which must have 
existed in order to make this ascertained fact 
or group of facts possible. 
(2) The second step is the interpretation of the sit- 
uation thus ascertained as to: 
(a) The causes which led up to it, and 
(b) The consequences which have followed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
       
    172 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
(8) The third step in the process is the application 
of the information thus acquired to the explanation 
of other situations under study, and to present social 
situations. 
Method of historical research—The process of his- 
torical research, which is essentially the process of the 
student of history, may be illustrated by observation 
of the methods of the archeologist. The workmen 
digging in an ancient ruin unearth a bit of wall, a 
fragment of marble, a bit of statuary, some fragments 
of pottery. This collection of material becomes what 
the logician calls a ‘‘monument,’’ an accepted group 
of facts from which to determine other facts which 
must exist or have existed in connection with those 
discovered. From this monument the explorers pro- 
ceed to think out the original situation of which these 
uncovered relics evidently were a part. In this man- 
ner they conclude that they are digging on the site of 
an ancient temple. Little by little, by means of in- 
ference from the material in hand, and employing the 
reconstructive imagination, they restore in mind the 
original structure with its interior arrangements, 
its furnishings, decorations and possibly the cere- 
monies which were performed at its altars. From 
these they may go on to an understanding, in 
part at least, of the religious and philosophic con- 
ceptions of the people, and thus to rather full 
information with regard to a body of fact which 
at first did not appear. This is the method of the 
trained detective. Given a scant clue he uncovers the 
entire story of the crime and locates the perpetrator 
by conceiving, by means of inductive reasoning and
-P-A-G-E-191
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 173 
reconstructive imagination, the situation which must 
have existed congruent with the known facts. 
The writer of history does not stop with the discov- 
ery and record of such situations. He conceives of 
human life as a continuous stream made up of the 
main current and certain minor or secondary currents 
and eddies. He re-examines the data acquired and 
endeavors to select that which has significance as 
showing the drift of human life. He turns the light 
of his selected knowledge upon other accepted facts; 
he traces out causal relations, and endeavors to locate 
the real sequence of events. 
Illustration from American history—Taking an illus- 
tration from American history, in the study of the 
Missouri Compromise the first step is to ascertain 
the nature of its provisions from the reading of a 
reprint of the document or from authentic résumés 
of its contents. The second step is to see from the 
nature of its provisions, as well as from the accounts 
of the passage of the measure, what the situation sur- 
rounding this action was at Washington and in the 
country at large. With this situation clearly con- 
ceived, the student is then prepared to investigate: 
first, the causes leading up to this situation and to the 
compromise of issues; and, secondly, the political, eco- 
nomic and. social consequences which developed from 
the measure. With these causal connections traced 
out, the student then is prepared to turn the light of 
his new knowledge upon former legislation to test its 
wisdom, and upon the expediency of compromise 
measures in the settlement of issues upon which the 
opinion of classes and sections is sharply divided.
-P-A-G-E-192
  
174 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Treatment of current history—Topics in current 
history will be similarly treated. If the federal ad- 
ministration of the railroads during the war is under 
consideration, the first step, obviously, is to ascertain 
from available sources precisely what the government 
did. The second step is to work out a conception, 
among other factors, of the conditions of traffic, of 
railway finance, the exigencies of the war, the attitude 
of labor, the disposition of the people, the current 
economic theories, which constituted the situation 
forced upon our country in the matter of rail trans- 
portation. With this conception developed, the stu- 
dent will then direct his attention to the various eco- 
nomic, political and psychological causes which created 
this situation and which compelled the government to 
undertake this burden. The fourth step is the con- 
sideration of the consequences, economic and political, 
which have followed this measure. The study would 
end with the comparison of our experience in govern- 
mental administration of the railroads with our ex- 
perience in the governmental management of other 
utilities and with the experience of other nations in 
state administration of industrial activities. The 
topic offers splendid opportunity for application to 
many current questions and to questions of the func- 
tions of government, the relative spheres of private 
and public interest in industrial undertakings, and of 
the relative efficiency and ethical level of governmental 
and private enterprise, all of which should be com- 
pletely worked out. 
Method in the high school—Now the teaching of 
history in the high school must employ this same proc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 175 
ess: (1) acquisition of the body of fact belonging 
to the topic or period assigned; (2) tracing out the 
causal relations with what preceded and followed; 
(3) application to the further illumination of former 
studies and to problems now before the people. Nec- 
essarily the high school pupil is limited to the use of 
his textbooks, manual, and reference materials for 
his facts. He must accept his data on authority. But 
good teaching will make certain that he clearly and 
definitely understands what are the facts in the case 
and that he has these firmly fixed in mind as to action, 
time, and place. This is the basic element in the les- 
son. This part of the task is the main feature of the 
student’s work in preparation, and must be well done; 
otherwise the remainder of the lesson will have small 
value. By means of well-chosen questions given in 
the assignment, the student may be led to such reflec- 
tion on the facts learned and such examination of the 
authorities available as to think out the concrete situa- 
tion involving the facts under study. The subsequent 
steps in the process, tracing out the reasons why these 
things happened, when and where they happened, and 
their significance for us, are for the most part prop- 
erly the work of the teacher in the recitation. To put 
the matter in a formal manner: 
I. The lesson assignment will comprise: 
1. The mastery of the information given in the 
text and other study-materials with reference 
to the topics designated. 
2. Study of questions formulated with the pur- 
pose to direct the pupil’s mind along such  
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
lines of inference as will lead him to conceive 
the situation as fully as possible. 
II. The recitation will comprise: 
1. An exacting quiz of the class to insure that 
the pupils have properly mastered the matter 
assigned, and further questioning to develop 
the concept of the situation. 
2. Interpretation by the teacher of the causal 
relations and significance of the event, indi- 
vidual, or period, in the total life of man. 
In the ‘‘Editor’s Introduction’? to Johnson’s 
“Teaching of History,’’ Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler 
has cogently outlined this method in a single paragraph 
which deserves to be held constantly before the mind 
of the teacher: ‘‘One of the wisest and most success-~ 
ful teachers of history that ever lived in America, 
Professor Francis Lieber of Columbia College, used 
a method peculiarly his own, and achieved exceptional 
results by so doing. In his college classes he assigned 
as the task for each exercise a definite number of pages 
in a popular manual of the history of Europe that 
was translated from the German. This manual was 
nothing more than a compact and dessicated collection 
of facts, including dates, names, and important events. 
Each pupil was required to master the contents of 
the assigned number of pages. When the class met, 
the teacher required a selected pupil, in the presence 
of his classmates, to write upon the blackboard a 
summary of the events that happened in Great Brit- 
ain, for example, during the period under examination. 
By a system of cross-questioning the aid of the entire
-P-A-G-E-195
  
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY iT 
class was had in securing the correctness of this sum- 
mary. “Then another pupil would be summoned 
to do the same thing for France, another for Ger- 
many, another for Italy, and so on until all of 
the material included in the assigned portion of 
the textbook had been covered. Then the teacher, 
turning with a triumphant look to his class, was 
in the habit of saying: ‘Now you know what was 
happening in each of the great countries of Europe at 
a specified time. But why were those things happen- 
ing? You do not know. You will not find out from 
your textbook, but I will tell you.’ Then the eloquent 
and learned scholar poured forth a wealth of illumi- 
nating philosophical explanation that made the care- 
fully memorized facts forever real in the minds of his 
fortunate pupils. There is no better way to study or 
to teach history than that. The fundamental data, 
the dates, the names, the bare events, must be learned 
by the pupil, and having been learned they must be 
interpreted.’’ 
Learning of dates and places—In order to trace 
causal relationships, it is necessary that events shall 
be definitely fixed as to time and place. No systematic 
organization of historical material is possible without 
determining the sequence of movements. Without 
doubt much of the haziness of pupils as to the nature 
of historical facts is due to the failure of their teachers 
to require them to fix definite boundaries of history. 
The learning of the time of a happening and its defi- 
nite location gives a mental anchorage for the fact 
without which it floats about in the mind as an estray. 
That is, the learning of dates and location in the
-P-A-G-E-196
  178 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
study of history is in a very significant sense a psycho- 
logical necessity as well as a logical convenience. The 
question of whether or not pupils shall be held for 
such mastery is not a matter of discretion on the part 
of the teacher. It may be accepted as a broad prin- 
ciple that a historical fact that is not so located can 
neither be truly conceived nor logically utilized. The 
significance of such a fact is wholly relative to its 
sequence in time and place. This does not mean that 
every possible date shall be learned, or that the study 
of history consists primarily in learning dates, but it 
does mean that the principal dates shall be learned, 
in fact, that the date of every event which is deemed 
of sufficient importance to master shall be learned, and 
to that extent the study of history does consist in 
learning dates. One of the writers of this book was 
deeply impressed with the futility of the current dis- 
regard of this element in history teaching while giving 
a course in War Aims to the young men in a Students 
Army Training Corps. These young men came from 
a large number of representative high schools, and 
were all high school graduates and some had as much 
as three years of college training. Yet the effort to 
trace with them the various movements and conditions 
leading up to the allignment of the nations of Europe 
in the Great War was entirely impossible until the 
program was suspended and the class taken back for 
several weeks’ drill on dates and locations. With this 
accomplished it was a fairly simple matter to grasp the 
relationships which at first were beyond reach. 
Other geographical data—In addition to learning 
the location of events the pupil must also understand   
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 179 
the other geographical features of the situation. It 
was observed in a former paragraph that historical 
causes are of two kinds: personal and physical. The 
physical causes are topography, climatic conditions, 
the character, extent and location of natural resources, 
character and location of markets, and all other physi- 
cal features which go to affect economic conditions 
and the temperament of the people. When the student 
understands the location and character of coal, iron 
and oil deposits in Europe, the extent and location of 
grain-producing regions, the location of fisheries, of 
the cotton and rubber belt in Africa, the location of 
natural harbors, mountain passes, navigable rivers, 
and natural routes for railroads, the issues and allign- 
ment in the Great War readily become intelligible. 
Wars frequently develop into a struggle for ideals, 
but ordinarily they begin in competition for those eco- 
nomic and political advantages which are determined 
wholly by geographic conditions, and are to be thus 
explained. Certainly in the adjustment of peace terms 
geography is the primary determining factor. Rev- 
olutions and other internal changes usually rest upon 
spiritual conditions; international relations are quite 
as generally grounded in geographic conditions. The 
student is referred to Semple’s admirable little volume 
on ‘‘Geographic Influences in American History’’ for 
a pertinent suggestion as to this phase of the study of 
all history. On the side of the personal factor in the 
growth of nations it should be observed that racial 
and national characteristics have large influence. 
Hence, national traits should also receive rather defi- 
nite attention in considering the geographic aspects of

180 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the subject. Experience reveals that high school 
pupils are naturally interested in the physical factors 
in human life and in the larger spiritual factors, 
rather more than in the political and dynastic issues 
involved. This suggests obviously that the high school 
course is the period in which this phase of historical 
study may be most advantageously mastered. 
Relating history to the personal experience of 
pupils—Possibly the greatest difficulty to overcome in 
the high school work in history is the unrelatedness of 
much of the subject to the personal experience of the 
pupils. This makes it necessary for the teacher to 
provide the experience which is lacking, by the intro- 
duction of the largest amount possible of concrete 
material. A large number of personal contacts should 
be given through utilizing the connections of ac- 
quaintances with the places and events involved. In 
most classes there will be pupils who have descended 
from families who were engaged in the outstanding 
movements of modern European history; Huguenots, 
emigrants from Germany in 1849, refugees from Rus- 
sia, soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. A review 
of the experiences of such families will give an element 
of ‘‘human interest’? to these topics. For the same 
reason much should be made of biography. ‘The pupil 
of any age is instinctively interested in persons. High 
school pupils particularly are romantic and strongly 
attracted to the outstanding personalities of all times. 
A clever teacher may readily utilize this interest as 
the approach to the movements of a period. There 
is the additional reason for emphasis on biography in 
the fact that the life of a nation is quite largely an
-P-A-G-E-199
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 181 
expression of the thought and will of its few outstand- 
ing individuals. These personalities think and decide 
for the masses of the people. An understanding of 
the leaders lets the pupil into the clearest conception 
of the period. In a way, also, the leader is a reflection 
of the spiritual life and the national purposes of his 
people. Thus, again, the study of biography is a 
direct approach to the significant facts of the people 
or the period. Martin Luther explains German 
Protestantism for the reason that he both reflects the 
tendencies of the German people of that period and 
gave character and direction to those tendencies. 
Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and John Calhoun in 
the same manner explain the American Civil war. 
Cromwell, Disraeli, Gladstone, Napoleon and Bis- 
marck explain their times and movements. It is 
scarcely possible to over-emphasize the biographical 
elements. 
Making instruction concrete—For concreteness the 
teacher must depend largely upon ‘‘source material’’; 
antiques, diaries, correspondence, reprints of original 
documents, and other published matter of the period 
under study. As much of such material as is avail- 
able should be placed in the hands of the pupils. 
They should be required to have a personal acquaint- 
ance with all such documents as the theses of Luther, 
the Magna Charta, the Treaty of 1815, the Franco- 
Prussian Treaty, the Articles of Confederation, the 
Missouri Compromise. Some very successful teachers 
have found excellent source-material in pictures hav- 
ing a historical content. It is quite possible through 
collections of prints and clippings, put into orderly 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
arrangement, to tell the story of civilization rather 
completely in-a form which appeals to the eye. The 
most valuable accessory of the history teacher is the 
abundant supply of literature covering the important 
periods. Narrative poetry and fiction are especially 
valuable in this connection. The function of this 
material is not to displace the textual material—the 
scientific treatment of the subject—but to give the 
facts thus acquired that romantic value which the 
mind craves. Just as the books of Ruth and Esther 
in the Bible let the reader into the spirit of ancient 
Israel, so the ‘‘ Auneid,’’ the ‘‘Odyssey,’’ ‘‘ Paradise 
Lost,’’ ‘‘The Knights of the Round Table,’’ Scott’s 
novels, and the less classic fiction of the modern writ- 
ers give flesh and blood to the story of human life. 
Such material is immensely valuable in assisting the 
student to sense the situations of historic events, and 
in the interpretative process of his studies. Any bias 
of mind which may be involved is more than evened up 
by the fact that the pupil acquires a definite point of 
view and a large concrete element in his conception of 
the subject. 
Use of reference material—It is very important that 
the pupil become acquainted with at least a few author- 
ities on each epoch, not only to give a trustworthy fund 
of fact, but also as a mental discipline and to secure 
the peculiar solidity of scholarship which comes of a 
substantial mental background. The school library 
may easily afford the small number of such books 
needed to cover the entire course, and familiarity with 
their contents will give a first-hand quality of student-
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 183 
ship which insures active interest as well as definite- 
ness of mastery. 
Developing the critical attitude—An effort should be 
made to develop a critical attitude in the student. This 
may be accomplished in part through class discussion 
of questions on which there may reasonably be dif- 
ferences of opinion, and in part through the study of 
the critical judgment of authorities. The essential 
thing is to stimulate a personal reaction of the pupil 
to the questions at issue. The training of the critical 
habit of mind is necessary if the study of history is to 
have the prudential value claimed for it in the first 
part of this chapter. Before completing the secondary 
course, the pupil should acquire a rather definite 
standard of judgment to evaluate the movements and 
events under study. The development of such stand- 
ard is one of the chief functions of the teacher. The 
habit of critical judgment, like all other habits, can be 
developed through constant practice. The making of 
note-books and the writing of papers are helpful if 
made to contain the pupil’s own findings and conclu- 
sions. There is not much value in filling them with 
material copied from source books. As stated above, 
the real value comes from the personal reaction of the 
pupil. 
Suggestive lesson plans—But a word is needed as 
to the class exercise. The assignment should be def- 
inite as to topics, and with younger pupils should give 
definite reference to sources. The recitation should be 
devoted to rigid drill on the assignment, followed by 
the presentation of supplementary matter by the

  184 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
teacher, by his elucidation of the significance of the 
facts, and by an abundance of class debate on questions 
developed in the teacher’s discussion. In order to se- 
cure the largest economy of time and labor, it is neces- 
sary to provide for supervised study in history, what- 
ever the plan followed in the school. The results of 
such factors as library work, note-making, search for 
authority, can have little value except as the pupils are 
trained in the method of such work. The following is 
suggested as a plan for a lesson on 
The ratification of the Constitution of the United 
States

to assure that the pupils have faithfully mas- 
tered the facts, and to fix them definitely in mind. 
2. Presentation of supplementary information by 
the teacher. 
3. Explanation of the issues involved and of the 
consequences contingent upon ratification. 
4. Pointing out political issues and allignments 
which resulted from the discussions and action 
of the states, and which became issues in subse- 
quent years. 
5. Raising of questions as to the merit of the argu- 
ments for and against the new constitution. 
Stimulate class discussion of these questions, en- 
couraging pupils to fortify their positions by re- 
course to the authorities. 
6. Have pupils write report of their findings as to 
facts and issues, and as to conclusions with ref- 
erence to the questions under discussion. The 
notes may very well contain a bibliography of the 
subject with specific citations. 
Summary 
History is the account of the development of civi- 
lization, considered as the system of knowledge, at- 
titudes, skills and instrumentalities which constitute 
the means of satisfying human wants. The growth of 
the means of human satisfactions, in volume, variety, 
and refinement, and the general uplift of man’s ac- 
tivities above the primitive mode, constitute the 
subject-matter of history. _ 
It is imperative that the teacher have a true per-  
-P-A-G-E-204
  186 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
spective of his subject. He must consider all aspects 
of life. The rise of civilization is irregular. First 
one and then another of the seven factors in human 
life has been dominant. It is a mistake to attempt 
to explain all history in terms of economic struggle, 
or of class conflict, or of educational advance, or of 
any other one factor. 
It is also an error to attempt a purely idealistic 
interpretation of historical facts, or, on the other 
hand, to attempt a purely materialistic explanation. 
In one situation spiritual forces are dominant, in an- 
other physical causes exert the larger influence, and 
at another time they work together. 
The objectives in the study of history are: (1) the 
acquisition of a body of knowledge of historical fact, 
(2) the development of insight into social tendencies, 
(3) the development of the socialized disposition. 
The learning process in history is the same as the 
process in historical research. 
The essential steps in the teaching process are: (1) 
mastery of the body of fact belonging to the topic 
or period assigned, (2) tracing the causal relation 
with what precedes and what follows, (3) application 
to the further illumination of former studies and to 
problems now before the people. 
The study of a period, movement or institution 
should be pushed through to a clear insight into its 
social implications. It should terminate in the illum- 
ination of the learner’s own life. 
It is necessary in the effective presentation of much 
of history to provide the learner with an experience 
needed for an understanding of the topic under study,

by means of concreteness of presentation, but espe- 
cially by the use of the literature and art of the pe- 
riod.

  CHAPTER Ix 
TEACHING CIVICS 
The teaching of civics aims at certain practical re- 
sults as distinguished from scientific ends. The sub- 
ject is therefore technical rather than academic. The 
object is training for good citizenship. As formerly 
conceived the spirit was rather academic than other- 
wise, and hence very properly the study could be 
merged into the course in history. But with the more 
recent emphasis on efficiency for right things in citi- 
zenship, resting upon a proper emotional experience 
and participation in wholesome civic activities, the 
subject has come to require a place of its own in the 
curriculum. The values sought are social and moral. 
The objectives are three: 
(1) The acquisition of a knowledge of the agencies, 
processes and principles of citizenship, and the con- 
ception of a standard of judgment for determining 
the civic worth of men and measures. 
(2) The development of those activities and dispo- 
sitions which motivate good citizenship, including the 
spirit of Good Will, and the Socialized Conscience. 
(3) The development of skill in the processes of 
citizenship, particularly in those local functions which 
constitute so large a part of the duties of the citizen 
and whose performance is so large a measure of civic 
virtue. 
189
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Knowledge of local institutions—Obviously a knowl- 
edge of governmental agencies is necessary as a 
proper basis for civic training. This body of knowl- 
edge must comprise an understanding of the machin- 
ery of local government: (1) the police system, (2) 
the water system, (3) the agencies for safeguarding 
health, (4) for fire protection, (5) for public improve- 
ments, (6) for storage and distribution of food and 
fuel, (7) the educational system, (8) the provision 
for recreation, (9) the street railway system, (10) 
the system of municipal finance. These studies con- 
stitute the first division of our subject, both logically 
and psychologically—logically, for the reason that all 
higher orders of administration have grown out of the 
relinquishment of powers by the community author- 
ities; psychologically, because citizens grow into the 
higher and broader levels of civic worth through fidel- 
ity to local responsibilities, and because loyalty to 
state and nation is rooted and nurtured in loyalty to 
the home neighborhood. Much of poor citizenship is 
rooted in the people’s ignorance of their local insti- 
tutions and of the possibilities of these for use and 
abuse. Right impulses they must have, of course, 
but these impulses must be guided by an adequate 
intelligence as to the local functions which must be 
performed and as to the provision made for their per- 
formance. 
What study of local government should include—The 
study of local government must include: (1) a con- 
ception of the several needs of the community to be 
satisfied; (2) the kind of persons charged with the 
several responsibilities thus arising out of these com-
-P-A-G-E-209
    TEACHING CIVICS 191 
munity needs, the qualification which such persons 
are supposed to possess, the mode of their selection, 
the powers conferred upon them, the facilities given 
them for doing the work with which they are charged; 
(3) the consequences of good and bad service; (4) 
a conception of what constitutes efficiency in each line 
of service. The study should result in the pupils’ 
knowing definitely what constitutes good service, how 
to secure officials who will render good service, and 
how to get rid of the inefficient and vicious. The 
majority of people are well-disposed, and with the 
intelligence such an investigation would give, they will 
certainly become dynamic in the community life. 
Class surveys—Class surveys of community condi- 
tions have been shown by extensive experimentation 
to be possibly the most effective method of securing 
the species of intelligence described in the preced- 
ing paragraph. An investigation of the infant mor- 
tality of the community, going into its relation to 
the social welfare, and tracing its causes back to un- 
intelligent care on the one hand and the quality of 
the milk supply on the other, will open up the prob- 
lems of education and sanitation in a manner which 
arouses purposeful interest and definite plans for bet- 
terment. A study of epidemics will lead to the same 
positive reaction. A survey of street construction 
and repairs, of illiteracy, pauperism, crime, the street 
railway service, of the burden of local taxation, and 
similar problems, which like the proverbial poor are 
live issues in every community, will lead straight to 
the information as to needs, agencies, and conditions, 
which is the necessary foundation for intelligent and 
   
-P-A-G-E-210
  192 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
effective citizenship. Under wise direction such re- 
searches are easily within the range of the ability and 
interest of high school pupils, and experience has dem- 
onstrated the value of this approach to the field of 
community civics. 
The emphasis of the new, civics—The older civics 
placed the stress on office-holding; the new civics will 
place the emphasis on voting, the gravest responsi- 
bility of the American citizen. Under this new em- 
phasis the school will strive to teach the pupil how to 
vote in the primary, and in the regular elections; for 
whom he should vote; how his vote is counted and re- 
ported; the consequence of intelligent voting, and of 
failure to vote; it will seek to develop the concep- 
tion that the elector is the sovereign and the candidate 
an applicant for service in his employ, and make real 
the meaning of the phrase ‘‘the sovereignty of the citi- 
zen.’? The school will also endeavor to make clear 
the possible abuses of our electoral system and the 
heinousness of such crime against the people. 
Passing from the community to the state—The second 
division of the subject deals with the state. In pass- 
ing from the local community to the commonwealth 
the teacher should develop further the conception of 
representative government to which the pupil was 
introduced in his study of local elections. He should 
conceive of the state constitution as a compact entered 
into by all of the people of the state whereby certain 
powers and functions are relinquished by the com- 
munities and delegated to a body of officials selected 
for the purpose. The provisions of this compact 
should be mastered, the division of responsibility be-
-P-A-G-E-211
    TEACHING CIVICS 193 
tween local and state officials clearly defined, and the 
machinery of the state government surveyed. Again, 
the best approach to this information is through a 
study of the needs of the people to be satisfied by state 
functions, the agencies provided for each, the qualifi- 
cations of officials necessary to efficiency, what consti- 
tutes efficient performance, and the consequences to 
the people of good and bad service. In these studies 
the case and survey methods may be employed ad- 
vantageously. The former, perhaps, is more often 
available. The case of a person indicted for crime 
may be followed through the courts to the state’s 
prison, tracing the constitution and authority of the 
trial court, the appellate courts, the origin and provi- 
sions of the law under which the action is taken, the 
administration of the prison, the function of the 
Board, the power of the Governor, the efforts at rec- 
lamation. The case of an insane person or a defec>, 
tive, highway improvement, the licensing of physi- | 
cians, the state school system, the safeguarding of/ 
titles to property, the settlement of estates of de; 
ceased persons, and similar problems coming under 
the personal observation of the pupil, will afford such 
concrete approach to the functions and agencies of 
the state government as will surely give an intelligent 
appreciation and a proper foundation for personal 
judgment. 
Passing from state to federal government—In the 
same manner the class may pass from the state to the 
federal government, making the approach through the 
conception of a compact entered into by all of the 
people of the nation creating a new body of public
-P-A-G-E-212
    194 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
officials whose field of operation extends to the whole 
country, and to whom are committed certain functions 
and responsibilities of which the state and local offi- 
cials have been relieved. Here again, the truest con- 
ception of organization and functions will be secured 
by proceeding to a definition of the needs of the peo- 
ple to be satisfied by the federal government, the agen- 
cies created to perform such service, the qualifica- 
tions needed in the persons selected for these duties, 
what constitutes efficient service and the consequences 
to the people of good and bad service. The case 
method may also be employed in these studies. Be- 
ginning with the postal service, the regulation of the 
currency in the pockets of the pupils, the weights and 
measures which they employ, interstate industrial ac- 
tivities, public improvements of national concern, re- 
lations with foreign nations which affect the whole 
people, and similar problems familiar in the daily 
lives of the pupils, they may be led directly into ac- 
quaintance with the federal government as a working 
institution. 
Cultivating the socialized conscience—It was stated 
in the beginning paragraph of this chapter that the 
first objective in the study of civics is the acquisition 
of an intelligent knowledge of the functions and 
agencies of government, and of a standard of judg- 
ment of its efficiency. The second objective is the 
cultivation of the attitude of Good Will, and the So- 
cialized Conscience. By good will is meant the neigh- 
borly feeling that wishes every one well, that prompts 
the individual to wish for every one all of the good
-P-A-G-E-213
  
TEACHING CIVICS 195 
things he craves for himself. Coffin’ defines the 
socialized conscience as involving the well-developed 
impulse to strive for betterment of the conditions of 
the whole people, and the habit of measuring values 
in terms of the quality of personality produced. Such 
a conscience is alive to the general welfare and dis- 
posed to value all things, measures and persons ac- 
cording to their contribution to the making of the 
finest specimens of manhood and womanhood. This 
conception is based on the principle that the end of 
all human affairs is the development of persons. 
These two attitudes are the mother of all the civic 
virtues, and it is in the cultivation of these impulses 
that the character of citizenship is effectively assured. 
There can be no sound citizenship without the founda- 
tion of adequate knowledge, but knowledge of ways 
and means of civic enterprises may be wholly anti- 
social unless the individual has developed wholesome 
emotional tendencies. ‘‘The course in civies will 
chiefly be helpful in creating the foundation of knowl- 
edge upon which good citizenship may rest, provided 
the pupil has a sound character and becomes public- 
spirited. Good government is impossible unless there 
is in the community an active public sentiment and 
one that is intelligently directed.’’ ? 
The influence of the teacher—The method suggested 
for the study of goverment will go far toward cul- 
tivating these necessary mental attitudes. Taken in 
connection with the native chivalry of youth, these

-P-A-G-E-214
  196 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
problem-studies will likely be sufficient to motivate 
properly the majority of the pupils. The attitudes of 
the teacher will have great influence. Young people 
are highly suggestible. They are disposed to accept 
the viewpoint of the teacher who is positive in his own 
attitudes. However, the most certain way to awaken 
and fix an emotion is through the natural reaction of 
appropriate activity. Participation of the pupil in 
public-spirit enterprises will tend to make him per- 
manently public-spirited. He becomes emotionally 
committed to the kind of activities in which he en- 
gages. The school, therefore, may accomplish much 
in the way of definitely motivating pupils for con- 
structive citizenship by contriving situations and ac- 
tivities which employ them in affairs designed to se- 
cure social betterment. Any community offers abund- 
ant opportunity for enterprises of this character. 
Further suggestion applicable to this phase of the 
course will appear in the discussion of the third ob- 
jective; namely, the development of skill in civic ac- 
tivities. 
Practice in citizenship—It is essential in a system of 
effective training for citizenship to give the youth ex- 
tensive experience in civic activites. The major por- 
tion of the time devoted to this phase of education 
might well be devoted to participation in civic func- 
tions under supervision—in what one would call su- 
pervised practice in citizenship. Just as the medical 
student has a term of experience in various clinics 
under the direction of experts, and the teacher must 
do a minimum amount of practice teaching, and as the 
student of mechanics is required to give possibly half
-P-A-G-E-215
  
TEACHING CIVICS 197, 
of his time to shop work, so the candidate in training 
for citizenship needs practice in the processes of his 
profession and to become acquainted with the con- 
ditions affecting his tasks by first-hand experience 
under the guidance of a properly qualified interpreter. - 
Hence, the proposal that the scheme of education shall 
provide a laboratory experience in citizenship for the 
pupil, with formal instruction in civics heading to- 
ward such experience, and with the school itself and 
the community as the laboratory. 
Utilizing school activities—The school offers many 
opportunities for such practice in the numerous stu- 
dent activities which have become a prominent part of 
school life. Such activities may develop into side 
shows which over-top the main tent, or they may be 
utilized for giving practical form to the essential proc- 
esses of the school. The questionable feature of 
‘school activities’? is not so much the possibility of 
having too many of them as the danger, on the one 
hand, of being permitted to go without the intelligent 
guidance which connects them up to the educational 
program of the school rather than the pleasure life 
of the community, and, on the other hand, the chance 
that only a few of the students will get the emotional 
experience and training secured. in active participa- 
tion. The appeal to school loyalty, the emotional re- 
action of fighting for the colors of the school, rooting 
for the debating team, arduous and self-sacrificing 
practice in order that the school orchestra may excel 
its former record,—all such things which are so stim- 
ulating to high school youth may readily be turned 
to splendid account in developing public-spiritedness  
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and good will. It is a matter of simple adjustment to 
give pupils a valuable experience in participation in 
the government of the school. 
Utilizing the community for pupil-practice in civic 
functions—But the field of most promising value to the 
teacher of civics is the community. The surveys sug- 
gested in another paragraph, directed to give the 
pupil an intimate and accurate personal acquaint- 
ance with his community and its agencies and con- 
ditions, are in themselves a valuable training. Such 
experience is rather certain to develop a permanent 
attitude of inquiry as to facts. In addition to all of 
these things it would seem feasible to effect an ar- 
rangement by which the pupil could serve an appren- 
ticeship in some one or more departments of the com- 
munity administration. A brief but real experience 
on the police patrol, on the sanitary squad, inspect- 
ing conditions and directing clean-ups, in the force 
of the superintendent of parks, as a helper in the city 
playground administration, and similar branches of 
municipal activity, would have immense educational 
value. The plan has been found to be entirely fea- 
sible in industrial education in some cities where ar- 
rangements have been made with industrial plants to 
take students into the shops for regular employment 
on a part-time adjustment. The suggestion now is 
that the same plan be extended to local governmental 
activities. By dividing the pupils into shifts alter- 
nating at study and work, the job would be contin- 
uously filled and the classroom work not seriously in- 
terrupted. In this manner an apprenticeship may be 
provided in:

ing may be given in the work of children’s clubs, 
library extension, mission work, and other social 
betterment efforts. The opportunities for this kind 
of work in rural communities are almost as numerous 
but, of course, more difficult. Yet the organization of 
many kinds of community service is entirely feasible 
as boys’ and girls’ club work, library extension, com- 
munity recreation, mission work, service for the aged, 
and attention to the neglected. It is feasible to effect 
a working arrangement with the local health author-

ities to assist the rural Red Cross nurse, to survey 
rural sanitary conditions and to plan programs for 
betterment. Under the county agricultural agent 
various soil, drainage and crop surveys may be made 
looking to the planning of a county program for ag- 
ricultural improvement. The county highway su- 
perintendent could utilize high school helpers in study- 
ing the county road problem and planning for de- 
velopments. These are suggestive of activities within 
the compass of the high school pupil’s ability and in- 
volve lines of investigation and work which will ap- 
peal to him. Not only will such apprenticeship lead 
to a better understanding of the nature of civic prob- 
lems and develop skill in meeting the practical situa- 
tions of life, but the service rendered the community 
will react upon the pupils, stimulating their affection 
for the people and the causes which they serve. 
“Certain well-known principles of educational psy- 
chology are indispensable in the teaching of civics. 
The first of these is that the pupils’ interest must, 
first of all, be secured. It is far better to stimulate in- 
terest and to impart very little detailed information 
than to fill the mind with more or less well-understood 
facts at the expense of interest. Interest, once killed, 
is hard to regain; while with the interest thoroughly 
kindled, the facts will easily follow. Furthermore, it 
is the individual’s interest, and not his knowledge, 
that leads to action. The right kind of interest be- 
hind a very few facts will lead to good citizenship, 
while any number of facts without the interest will 
fail to do so.
-P-A-G-E-219
  
TEACHING CIVICS 201 
“Tt is also a matter of common knowledge that the 
surest way to kindle and maintain the child’s interest 
is to build on his own experience, passing constantly 
from the facts of his experience to related facts just 
beyond his experience, and back again to his own ex- 
perience.’’ 1

  202 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Summary 
The course in civics should be practical rather than 
academic. Its object is good citizenship, which rests 
upon a proper emotional experience and participation 
in wholesome civic activities, quite as much as or 
more than on a body of knowledge. The values 
sought are social and moral. 
The three objectives are: (1) such acquaintance 
with the agencies, processes and principles of citizen- 
ship as will become a standard of judgment for de- 
termining the civic worth of men and measures; (2) the 
development of the socialized disposition; (3) skill in 
the processes of citizenship, particularly in local 
functions. 
Civics should be largely a field study, and devoted 
primarily to local conditions and activities. The 
problem or project-method should be employed. 
The study of the community should include (1) the 
several needs to be satisfied, (2) the kind of person 
and agency required for satisfying these needs, (3) 
the consequences of good and bad service, and (4) a 
conception of what constitutes efficiency in each line 
of service. 
Class surveys have been found very effective. 
The older civics placed the stress on office-holding; 
the new civics places the emphasis on voting. The 
study of the functions of the state government should 
begin with the forms of service rendered within the 
community by state agencies. 
In like manner, the federal government should be
-P-A-G-E-221
  
TEACHING CIVICS 203 
approached through local services, as, for instance, 
the service of the post office. 
The attitude of the teacher has very much to do 
with determining the social disposition of his pupils. 
It is necessary that he be social minded. 
The major portion of the time devoted to civics 
might well be devoted to participation in civie activ- 
ities under supervision—in supervised practice in 
citizenship. In many departments of the municipal 
government, provision may readily be made for giving 
the high school pupils first-hand experience.

    CHAPTER X 
SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
The special study of community civics properly be- 
longs to the junior high school. The courses in history 
in the senior high school form the groundwork of in- 
struction in the more specialized social sciences. The 
student recalls that stress was laid on the principle 
that the main reason for teaching history is to reveal 
the nature of our civilization to-day as developed out 
of the past, and to prepare the pupil for intelligent cit- 
izenship—its primary function is to socialize the young 
citizen. These applications of past experience will go 
far toward fitting him for the privileges and respon- 
sibilities upon which he will soon enter. To give no 
more training than this provides will be inadequate to 
the demands of the situation as more specialized in- 
struction is necessary. 
The aim of the high school is to prepare its pupils, 
who will not continue their education in college and 
university, for active life in the present social order. 
This preparation must relate the individual so in- 
telligently to the existing conditions that he may take 
advantage of the situations which inure to his wel- 
fare, and also protect himself from harm. Our social 
order is largely organized on the economic basis. 
Modern scholarship avers that there is a body of 
205
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
economic law operating to govern material welfare, 
just as biological law governs physical well-being 
and as psychological principles govern mental proc- 
esses. Practical men accept the doctrines of the 
scholars, and transact business accordingly. The 
man, therefore, who is equipped for making the pro- 
per personal adjustments of his program to exist- 
ing conditions, must be trained in those principles of 
economics which constitute the platform of American 
life. 
Importance of a knowledge of industrial relations— 
Intelligent thinking concerning industrial problems 
requires an understanding of the fundamental prin- 
ciples of economic relations and processes. The 
laborer must possess this undertanding if he is to 
think out his own problems. The factory owner must 
have the same insight. The common man, who so 
much of the time is between the upper and nether 
mill-stones, needs to see through the situation. 
Every man, either as producer or consumer, is con- 
fronted with personal problems growing out of the 
industrial situation, which problems must be solved 
if his welfare is to be conserved. He ought to be able 
to think out these questions for himself. He must be 
able to do so if American society is to remain dem- 
ocratic. In fact, democracy means largely this 
particular kind of ability developed and functioning 
in the common man. Industrial democracy is this 
ability of the worker, and of the other man, each to 
think adequately for himself, rather than ownership 
of the factory by the workers. Hence, there is the 
demand for a carefully organized course in funda-   
#
-P-A-G-E-225
  SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 207 
mental economic principles in the high school, in the 
interest of the general welfare and of true industrial 
democracy. 
Political issues for most part economic—The whole 
people participates in the government of this nation 
by means of the ballot. The issues decided by pop- 
ular vote at municipal, state and national elections 
are for the most part economic. They relate, to such 
matters as industrial relations, to finance, taxation, 
conservation of natural resources, public improve- 
ments, and regulation of public utilities. To vote on 
these questions intelligently requires an understand- 
ing of the underlying principles. The decision of 
these questions is of vital consequence to community 
and state. Public and private welfare are at stake. 
If the voter does not cast his ballot in the light of a 
proper understanding of the issues, he votes blindly. 
He becomes the easy victim of the demagogue; his 
true citizenship is lost. He casts the ballot of his 
. boss, not his own. He votes in the interest of the 
men whose judgment governs his vote, and, as is well 
known, too often not in his own interest. That al- 
most universal ignorance of the facts and principles 
really involved in recent popular elections does exist, 
the reader well knows, and that this ignorance is en- 
dangering American democracy will be patent upon 
first thought. 
The individual both an industrial factor and a 
- citizen—Every man and woman sustains both of the 
relations to the economic order mentioned above,— 
an industrial factor and a citizen. He cannot escape 
these relations and their responsibilities. For we all 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  208 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
are consumers and all should be producers; all of us 
have assumed the responsibilities of voting and are 
harassed with the burdens of taxation. Certainly the 
school, as the agent of society for maintaining itself 
at proper levels, must make ample provision for 
training the new generation for these unescapable 
responsibilities and duties. No other ageney is in 
position to undertake this service. It seems evident 
that there is urgent reason for including a course in 
elementary economics in the high school. 
The educational values of such a course are ob- 
vious. First, there is the preparation afforded for 
a fuller understanding of history and for a better 
appreciation of vocational guidance and training. 
There is the practical value set out in the preceding 
paragraphs, and a large socializing influence. The 
student who is infected with the hateful class prej- 
udice, which is the greatest obstacle in the way of the 
establishment of social justice, gets a truer perspec- 
tive of social factors and functions in the study of 
economics that leads to a more tolerant spirit and 
makes agreement possible. A grasp of economic fact 
clears away the fog of popular thought, and with the 
disappearing mists go the miasmas which poison the 
hearts of the people. Greater moral stability fol- 
lows. Much of the incitement to private and public 
crime is destroyed. The truth makes for freedom, 
and for sanity and healthy-mindedness as well. The 
moral value is large and there will also be very con- 
siderable cultural values realized. The ability to 
grasp essential truth is always liberalizing; to think 
for oneself is to be free in the best sense. No more

desirable reconstruction is conceivable than to set 
American citizens right in their economic thinking. 
The disciplines to be derived therefrom are the same 
as in the other studies relating to institutional life. 
Teaching Objectives 
1. Knowledge objectives. 
The suggested instruction would have for its 
knowledge objective the presentation of the funda- 
mental facts and principles of the science of econom- 
ics in an elementary form, addressed to the range of 
ability and experience of high school students of the 
third and fourth years. Among the many topics 
which such a presentation would include are a num- 
ber which should receive special emphasis and care- 
ful consideration: 
A proper conception of the nature and forms of 
wealth. 
The things which contribute to the wealth of a 
people. 
That contribute to the wealth of an individual. 
What is property. 
How is property justly acquired. 
The responsibilities of ownership. 
Sources of value. 
Measures of value. 
The principle of supply and demand. 
What is capital. 
What is labor. 
The origins of capital in nature and in labor. 
Forms and varieties of labor.
-P-A-G-E-228
  
210 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The relation of capital and labor in the industrial 
situation. 
The working man as producer and consumer. 
What are wages, who pays them. 
What is a living wage. 
Interest and rents. 
The relation of production, distribution and con- 
sumption. 
Who are the producers. 
Who are the consumers. 
What function does the distributor perform. 
The economic significance of the waste of materials. 
Of time and energy. 
Of poor workmanship. 
‘What is money. 
Forms of money. 
‘What determines interest rates. 
What determines prices. 
Forms of taxation. 
Principles of correct taxation. 
Economic aspects of insurance. 
Of public improvements. 
The function of the banker. 
Of the promoter. 
Of combinations of capital. 
Of combinations of labor. 
Of combinations of consumers. 
2. Feeling Objectives. 
True citizenship requires the emotional support of 
a lively admiration of human institutions as well as a 
concern for the neighbor’s welfare. This admiration 
is a by-product of insight into the organization and
-P-A-G-E-229
  s 
  SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 211 
interdependence of institutions. No study opens up 
such commanding prospect more fully than economics, 
nor gives the individual greater assurance with ref- 
erence to social stability. In addition to this service 
in creating a wholesome attitude of mind, the study of 
our subject has a large curative value which the 
teacher should strive to realize, namely, to free the 
minds of his students from the bias of class- 
consciousness, and to give them what is well called 
the ‘‘socialized point of view.’’ 
8. Discipline objectives. 
In addition to the general discipline of orderly 
study, the course should result in the habit of the scien- 
tific reference of economic questions to first princi- 
ples rather than to party and class programs. 
Methods of Teaching 
The method of teaching elementary economics in 
the high school depends primarily upon the prepara- 
tion and personal qualifications of the teacher. If he 
possesses adequate scholarship in his subject, the 
scientific temperament, and quickness of grasp of con- 
crete embodiments of principles, within the range of 
his pupils’ observation, it is recommended that the 
‘‘problem method’’ be employed, supplemented by 
lectures, readings, reports, and class discussions. 
Political Science and Sociology 
Argument, almost if not equally strong, might be 
advanced in support of specialized courses in politi- 
eal science and elementary sociology. Exceedingly 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
    212 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
profitable courses thoroughly adapted to secondary 
school conditions are feasible in each of these branches 
of social science. The traditional course in civil gov- 
ernment can not be justified for the reason that it is 
concerned with governmental machinery, while what 
is needed as a basis of good citizenship is insight into 
the nature and consequence of political principles. 
No defence is required for the statement that the com- 
mon man to-day needs a clearer apprehension of the 
principles of representative government, of democ- 
racy, of nationalism, and of internationalism. There 
is need of a clearer conception of governmental func- 
tions as related to control of property, political reg- 
ulation of industry, national control of education, the 
paternalistic tendencies of modern governments. As 
long as the election of officials is entrusted to popular 
vote, the determination of governmental policies rests 
with the masses whose immediate leadership comes 
from the high-school-trained element of the popula- 
tion. The intelligence of the ballot, therefore, de- 
pends upon whether the high school responds effec- 
tively to the need of political insight and proper con- 
viction. 
As we have said before, the man is a seven-sided 
person. He is not only a worker and a citizen, but 
also a member of a family, a church man, a school 
man, a man of leisure, and a neighbor. He is vitally 
concerned in many problems in addition to those of 
making a living and securing justice. He finds his 
life conditioned by the activities of the church, of vari- 
ous educational agencies, by agencies which provide 
for recreation, by conditions which affect health, by   
 
-P-A-G-E-231
    SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 213 
the entire system of institutions, processes, and 
agencies which make up what we call his social en- 
vironment. He needs to understand these institutions 
—their functions, their interdependence, the value 
of the contribution each makes to the welfare of the 
individual. He needs, also, to understand how each 
of these institutions and agencies depends upon him, 
and thus how the general welfare rests upon the 
fidelity of his service in his various relationships. In 
these premises rests the demand for the inclusion of 
the elements of sociology in the high school program. 
To be sure, the instruction in history may be made 
rich with sociological insights, but there is general 
agreement that the results thus secured are not suffi- 
ciently definite, and, particularly, that they are not 
adequately related to the local situation of the pupil. 
At once, however, there arises the serious difficulty 
of the already overloaded curriculum. There ob- 
viously is not enough time available to give each of 
these subjects a special place, even if they should be 
properly reorganized for secondary students. The 
best solution of the problem yet offered is the plan 
proposed by the Commission on Reorganization of 
Secondary Education in its report on Social Studies 
in Secondary Education, published as Bulletin, 1916, 
No. 28, U. S. Bureau of Education. The plan, in 
brief, is ‘‘to study actual problems or issues, or con- 
ditions, as they occur in life, and in their several 
aspects, political, economic, sociological. These prob- 
lems or issues will naturally vary from year to year, 
and from class to class, but they should be selected 
on the ground (1) of their immediate interest to the
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
class, and (2) of their vital importance to society.’’ 
To illustrate, the following suggestion for the treat- 
ment of the immigration problem is quoted from page 
54 of the Bulletin: 
“The problem of immigration might impose itself upon 
the attention for any one of a number of reasons. It will 
have been touched upon in an elementary way in community 
civics, and doubtless will have come up in a variety of ways 
in connection with history; but it may now be considered 
more comprehensively, more intensively, and more exhaus- 
tively. One of the chief aims should now be to organize 
knowledge with reference to the economic, sociological, and 
political principles involved. 
“Economic relations of immigration: 
Labor supply and other industrial problems (on the side 
of ‘production’). 
Standards of living, not only of the immigrants, but also 
of native Americans as affected by immigration (on the side 
of ‘consumption’). 
Relation to the problem of land tenure in the United 
States. 
“Sociological relations of immigration: 
Movements and distribution of population; congestion in 
cities; ete. 
Assimilation of immigrant population; admixture of races. 
Vital statistics, health problems, ete. 
Educational and religions problems involved. 
Social contributions of immigrants; art, science, ethics. 
“Political and Governmental relations of immigration: 
Political ideals of immigrants; comparison of their inher-
-P-A-G-E-233
  SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 215 
ited political conceptions with those of the country of their 
adoption. 
Naturalization; its methods, abuses, ete. 
The courts in the light of the processes of naturalization. 
Administration of immigration laws. 
Defects and inconsistencies in the methods of our Govern- 
ment, as shown in legislation regarding immigrants and in 
the administration of the laws. 
Problems of municipal government arising from or com- 
plicated by immigration.’’ 
In a similar manner, studies may be made of the 
following questions, extending consideration of each 
as far as the time available will determine: 
The cost of living. 
The burden of taxation. 
The negro in industry. 
Nationalization of the mining industry. 
Nationalization of railroads. 
Peace plans. 
Recognition of revolutionary governments. 
The primary election. 
Care of the defective class. 
The state highway. 
Public playgrounds. 
Co-operative marketing. 
Is the bank the friend or foe of the workingman? 
What have the churches done for our community? 
The short working day. 
Should the employee participate in the management 
of the factory? 
Plans for betterment of our town. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  216 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Survey of local sanitary district. 
Survey of housing conditions in the community. 
Provisions for recreation in the community. 
Analysis of local, town, or city budget. 
The primary object of studies of this type is the 
cultivation of social mindedness rather than a fund 
of information. This point of view is well stated by 
the Committee: 
“‘The purposes of secondary education and not the intrin- 
sic value of any particular body of knowledge should be the 
determining consideration. From the standpoint of the pur- 
poses of secondary education, it is far less important that 
the adolescent youth should acquire a comprehensive knowl- 
edge of any or all of the social sciences than it is that he 
should be given experience and practice in the observation of 
social phenomena as he encounters them; that he should be 
brought to understand that every social problem is many- 
sided and complex; and that he should acquire the habit of 
forming social judgments only on the basis of dispassionate 
consideration of all the facts available. This, the committee 
believes, can best be accomplished by dealing with actual 
situations as they occur and by drafting into service the 
materials of all the social sciences as occasion demands for a 
thorough understanding of the situations in question.’’ 
Summary 
As modern society becomes more fully organized 
on an economic basis it becomes necessary that the 
school train its pupils in the economic principles which 
constitute the platform of American life. The com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
    SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 217 
mon man needs such training as well as the leader, the 
laborer as well as the capitalist. 
The future of American democracy depends upon 
the mutual trust and confidence that can come only 
from the ability of the worker and the employer to 
think their problems through, each for himself. 
The sway of the demagogue in American politics 
as well as in industry is due to the ignorance of 
fundamental economic principles on the part of the 
ordinary citizen. 
“‘Problem study’’ offers the most effective approach 
to the principles to be developed. In addition to the 
presentation of the elementary facts and principles 
the teacher should seek to establish the ‘‘socialized 
point of view.’’ 
Equally good cases might be made for specialized 
instruction in political science and sociology. Our 
citizen to-day needs a clearer apprehension of the 
principles of representative government, of democracy, 
of nationalism, and of internationalism. 
The intelligence of the ballot depends upon whether 
the high school responds effectively to the need of 
political insight and proper conviction. 
The individual is a member of the family, a school 
man, a church man, a neighbor and a man of leisure, 
as well as a worker and a voter. He is vitally con- 
cerned with the problems of each of the institutions 
of which he is a constituent member. Social welfare 
depends upon whether he has acquired proper con- 
ceptions and right attitudes as to each of these social 
relations. 
The most feasible provision for instruction in
-P-A-G-E-236
  218 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
economics, political science and sociology in the high 
school seems to be that suggested by the Commission 
on Reorganization of Secondary Education, namely: 
the study of the actual problems or current issues, 
considered as to their economic, political and socio- 
logical aspects, primary objects being the inculeation 
of basic principles involved and the development of 
social mindedness.

  CHAPTER jXt 
THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
  Science and the humanities distinguished—Before 
taking up the discussion of how to teach the several 
sciences as high school subjects, it may be profitable 
to consider for a moment the educational functions 
and differences of science studies as distinguished 
from the humanities. An understanding of these 
relationships is necessary to a proper conception of 
the place of science in the curriculum and as a basis 
for an intelligent co-ordination of work in these two 
groups of studies. This understanding should prove 
as valuable to the teacher of English or history as to 
the science teacher. 
Science deals with material facts, the humanities 
with human factors—In the first ‘place, science deals 
with the material elemenvg-and processes of the world, 
while the humanities deal with what have been va- 
riously called the spirit @1 or human elements. The 
sciences deal with the physical phenomena which make 
up what we call Nature.y~The humanities deal with 
the life, nature and especially the; behavior of man— 
his reactions to nature, his institutions, language, ac- 
tivities, emotions, hopes, dreams, faiths. The youth 
must live in a dual world—a world of natural forces 
and processes and also a world of men. Clearly he 
must be acquainted with the facts of both of these 
220  
-P-A-G-E-239
  THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 221 
worlds to which he must adjust himself. Hence, a 
properly balanced program of study should include 
a fair division of time between these two groups of 
studies. 
Science deals with the invariable, the humanities with 
the contingent—In the second place, these two groups 
of studies deal with different varieties of truth. 
Science deals with the invariable, the certain, the 
valid. There can be no apprehension with regard to 
the validity of the facts of science once they are estab- 
lished. The laws of nature we must accept as having 
certainty. Once the composition of a chemical com- 
pound is determined, it may be accepted with the full- 
est assurance. There is never any remainder. Its 
performance may be confidently caleulated. The stars 
in their tremendous journeys through the heavens 
are so constant that their paths may be mapped and 
their return timed to the minute. There is a ‘‘math- 
ematical certainty’’ about the laws of mechanics. 
Even in biology the student finds the same atmosphere 
of certainty. This quality of invariableness is one of 
the characteristics of the scientific group. Over 
against this quality is the fact of contingency in all 
human affairs. The personal element is not so cal- 
culable. The student of history may establish a per- 
fect parallelism of situations and yet he can not con- 
fidently predict that an individual or group of men will 
act the same way the second time. Human spirit re- 
fuses to be bound by laws and there is ever present an 
element of arbitrariness in human behavior. Man al- 
ways does the unexpected thing, the inexplicable, and 
so there can not be a truly scientific study of human
-P-A-G-E-240
222 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
history. The course of human events can never be 
ealeulated as the astronomer calculates the courses of 
the stars or the chemist the action of his chemicals. 
We can measure the behavior of a ray of light, but 
not the behavior of an idea. The vagrant heart and 
untamable will can not be anticipated. That is, every- 
thing in human behavior is contingent upon an un- 
known and incalculable factor. This principle is em- 
bodied in the old adage, ‘‘The exception proves the 
rule.’? Hence, we speak of ethics, rhetoric, grammar, 
politics, and linguistics as normative subjects. That 
is, they deal with standards of acceptable or average 
or the most frequently occurring behavior, rather than 
with necessities. For this reason the student of Latin 
is busied as much with learning exceptions to the rules 
as with learning the rules. The total influence of this 
feature of the study of the humanities on the mental 
habits of the pupil must be great, just as several years 
of work on subjects in which he deals with the in- 
variable must give a very definite quality to his mind. 
This again would indicate the necessity of the inclu- 
sion of a rather heavy program of scientific study to 
balance the humanities in the curriculum, in order 
that the pupil may. have equal training in the two 
varieties of judgment which the kind of world he lives 
in will require of him. 
Science exact, the humanities inspirational—Another 
difference between science and the humanities, like- 
wise indicating the need of both in the pupil’s pro- 
gram, is in the nature of the generalizations involved. 
The generalizations of science follow upon the anal- 
ysis and synthesis of situations in which all factors 
   
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 223 
may be accounted for; upon abstractions and com- 
parisons equally careful; and may be pushed up to 
the highest level of inquiry. On the other hand, the 
generalizations of the humanities involve what has 
been called ‘‘artistic induction,’? and usually are 
largely a matter of inspiration. 
The contrast—There is thus a certain opposition of 
science and the humanities. The relation might be 
better described as paradoxical, as the following 
shows: 
  Science The Humanities 
1. Gives command of na- Give command of men 
ture 
2. Trains in exact think- Train in contingent think- 
ing ing 
3. Trains for scientific in- Train for artistic induc- 
duction tion 
4. Gives freedom from Give the unity and 
tradition strength of tradition 
5. Gives the laws of Give inspiration for 
wholesome living 
6. Introduces the pupil to 
the world of nature. wholesome living 
Introduce the pupil to the 
world of spiritual real- 
ity. 
Each group of studies has its own peculiar educa- 
tional functions and both are necessary in the prep- 
aration of the youth for successful living. 
Scoring of educational values—The educational 
values of the science studies as a group have been 
scored as follows, employing 0, 1, 2, and 3 to indicate 
the four several degrees of value.
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
I. Instrumental Values. 
Introductory-Preparatory 3 
Vocational 3 
Socializing 0 
Moral 7 
Conventional 2 
Health 3 
II. Cultural. 
Liberalizing 3 
Sentimental 2 
Reconstructive 3 
III. Disciplinary. 
Growth of Mental Power 3 
Mental Attitudes 2 
Valuable Habits of Thought 3 
These values dependent on quality of teaching—To 
be sure, the values assigned above are in large meas- 
ure conditional upon the quality of the instruction 
given and the amount of the subject covered. The 
latter needs as much emphasis as the former. It is 
generally agreed that the educational results of less 
than a year’s work in a given science are very small, 
if at all appreciable. The most successful science 
teachers are almost unanimous in the opinion that two 
years of continuous work in a given subject is the 
minimum for real value. The pupil should by all 
means take two or even three years in one science 
rather than distribute this time over two, three, or 
more sciences. The semester courses still quite preva- 
lent in smaller high schools are indefensible. For 
many reasons it is desirable that the pupil have work 
   
-P-A-G-E-243
THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 225 
in both biological and physical science, and the ex- 
igencies of program-making may, of course, require 
a compromise of the time allowance. The point to 
be made in this connection is that the values listed 
above depend upon continuous study of the particular 
science for a sufficient period of time, to give the 
pupil real mastery of the elements of the science and 
its applications. 
Two dangers pointed out by Judd—The values 
depend also upon the clearness of teaching, upon the 
development of fundamental concepts, and especially 
upon pushing the study of each principle through to 
an understanding of its practical applications. Judd 
calls attention to two dangerous tendencies in current 
science teaching, one of which, over-specialization, 
may easily flow out of the suggestion of the preceding 
paragraph. The other is the divorce of theory and 
application. Something will be said in a subsequent 
paragraph with reference to the motive of science 
study, but clearly a subject cannot function fully in 
the pupil’s life until it is carried over in his mind and 
connected up with his life. Every discussion should be 
pushed through to a program of action. The voca- 
tional and inherent values will depend wholly upon 
working out the applications of the studies; the cul- 
tural values, on the other hand, depend largely upon 
the mastery of the fundamental concepts, laws and 
principles of the subject. They are secured as a by- 
product of the high-level generalizations which are pos- 
sible in all of the sciences. The disciplinary values 
result only from vigorous instruction and training. 
All of which means that the educational value of
-P-A-G-E-244
226 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS / 
‘science in our high schools depends upon the quality 
\ and quantity of teaching, upon the definiteness and 
vigor of the reaction secured from the pupils. The 
studies do not possess any intrinsic values which fune- 
tion automatically, and the teacher may properly as- 
sume that the value of his course depends upon his 
teaching rather than upon the subject. It may be of 
\ the highest worth, or it may be entirely worthless. 
~The motive of scientific study—While the discussion 
of each topic should be pushed through to its prac- 
tical application, the motive of the study would be the 
pupil’s demand for the truth. Wistorically, the mo- 
tive of science is the love of truth, not the solution of 
practical problems. The history of the amelioration 
of human life gives conclusive proof of the principle 
that pure scholarship as distinguished from applied 
science is the source of progress. This fact greatly 
needs emphasis with teachers of science at the present 
time. They should see the difference between the 
practical application of principles as the last step in 
the teaching process, and the quest for truth as the 
motive of the pupil. There is a popular tendency, 
both in our colleges and universities and at large, to 
attach greater importance to applied knowledge than 
to pure scholarship. This tendency is fairly char- 
acteristic of current education, and is manifest in 
textbooks, courses of study, educational doctrine, and 
the demands which the public makes of the schools. 
There is a very general disdain of pure science, of 
scholarship for the sake of scholarship, of culture for 
the sake of culture. The demand is for applied 
science, for so-called useful knowledge, and culture is 
   
-P-A-G-E-245
v r THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 227 
rejected as unworthy of busy men. The demand is 
that the schools shall confine themselves to baking 
bread, but the fact is that the current delimitation of 
the school is undemocratic. In the first place, it is 
truth pursued for its own sake which makes men free. 
The great advances in human liberty have resulted 
from discoveries and scientific investigations pursued 
with no thought of practical applications. Ben Frank- 
lin, flying his kite on the commons of Philadelphia, 
was intent upon but one thing, the discovery of the 
workings of a natural foree which the Creator had 
put into the machinery of the universe. So with Des- 
cartes, Harvey, Galileo, Faraday and Darwin. These 
men sought the truth for the sake of the truth. Like 
Paul, who would ‘‘press toward the mark for the prize 
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,’’ they 
sought merely to read the mind of God in his creation. 
Classification of the Sciences 
The following classification of the sciences available 
for the high school is suggested by De Garmo: 
I. The Exact Sciences 
Mathematics 
Physics 
> Chemistry 
Astronomy 
II. The Biological Sciences 
Zodlogy 
Botany 
Physiology (Bacteriology, Embryology, etc.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
III. The Earth Sciences 
Physical Geography 
Geology. 
The exact sciences are those in which chemical and 
mechanical forces are dominant. The facts with 
which they deal are comparatively stable, their re- 
actions constant. These relations are quite largely 
quantitative as well as qualitative, and the laws gov- 
erning them are expressed in mathematical terms. 
The mathematical subjects are for this reason placed in 
this group. Physics and chemistry, dealing with the 
forces which produce changes and determine the 
status of masses and of the molecules which enter into 
the composition of matter, obviously belong here. 
Astronomy, dealing with the organization of the whole 
stellar system, makes the fourth member of this 
group. 
The biological sciences are unified in the fact that 
all of them deal with the phenomena of living matter, 
with growth and development. This common subject 
matter also sets them off from the exact sciences. 
They are further distinguished in the methods em- 
ployed. Their phenomena do not ordinarily lend 
themselves to quantitative measurement and math- 
ematical representation. 
The third group comprises those subjects which 
deal with phenomena combining the mechanical and 
chemical forces on the one hand, and the evolutionary 
forces on the other. They also combine in large meas- 
ure the methods peculiar to each of the other two 
groups.
-P-A-G-E-247
THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 229 
This classification suggests that with reference to 
subject matter the study program should provide for 
a reasonable minimum of each subject at some place in 
the curriculum. With reference to the disciplinary 
functions, the program should contain at least math- 
ematics, one other exact science and one from each of 
the other two groups. The classification, considered 
in connection with the particular methods involved, 
indicates that the sequence of the subjects in the out- 
line is also the logical order in which they should be 
presented to the pupil. 
Summary 
In the ideal study program the sciences and human- 
ities are well balanced, the former offering a knowl- 
edge of man’s environment, the latter helping to an 
understanding of man himself. )Science gives the 
laws, the humanities thé inspiration for correct living. 
Science is richer in cultural and disciplinary values 
than in immediately practical applications. 
The minimum of time given to a science in the high 
school should be not less than a year. The values 
depend upon continuous study of the subject for a suf- 
ficient period to enable the pupil to acquire some de- 
gree of real mastery. 
The values depend also upon the clearness of teach- 
ing, upon the development of fundamental concepts, 
and, particularly, upon pushing the study of each 
principle taught through to an understanding of its 
practical application. 
There are two dangerous tendencies in much of
-P-A-G-E-248
230 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the science teaching in high schools: (1) over- 
specialization, and (2) divorce of theory and ap- 
plication. 
Historically, the motive of science is the love of 
truth, not the solution of practical problems, and the 
motive of the pupil in high school science should be 
his demand for the truth. 
The science program should provide for an intro- 
duction to each group of sciences.

  CHAPTER XII 
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 
Confusion as to the place of mathematics in the high 
school—In recent years there has been considerable 
confusion with regard to the content and organiza- 
tion of secondary mathematics, and, at present, there 
is a decided movement in the direction of reducing 
the amount required. In the traditional course of 
study mathematics shared with foreign language the 
place of honor in the curriculum. These subjects 
were the constants around which the program of in- 
struction was organized. With the increase of the 
amount of history, English, science, and vocational 
work, the tendency has been to reduce these subjects, 
once regarded as the essentials of culture as well as of 
college preparation, to a subordinate position. At the 
same time the problem of the proper sequence of math- 
ematical studies in the program has arisen. Many 
proposals for reorganization have been advanced. 
Some of these have been embodied in new textbooks 
and carried out in a few schools. 
Results of instruction are unsatisfactory—This con- 
fusion is, in part, indicative of progress in the ped- 
agogy of secondary mathematics, but is also the result 
of the unpreparedness of teachers to meet the cur- 
rent demand that every subject in the course shall 
231
-P-A-G-E-250
~ j . 
232 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
clearly justify itself. That is, the confusion is due 
chiefly to disappointment in getting tangible results. 
The experience of the colleges has shown that high 
school graduates are poorly prepared for college 
| mathematics. The utilitarian critics find, at the same 
time, that the students have little or no increase of 
practical ability. The extension of the e:ective system 
to the high school has quite genera’y removed the 
protection formerly enjoyed by algebra and geometry, 
and has revealed that pupils do not like these studies. 
Under the increasing application of the principle of 
interest as a guide in determining the course of study, 
the mathematical subjects have suffered severely. 
Reduced level of student ability partly responsible— 
There are several reasons for these unsatisfactory 
results. First of these is the reduced level of student 
ability because of the increased enrollment in the sec- 
ondary schools. The large relative growth of high 
school attendance is most gratifying from the socio- 
logical point of view, but necessarily presents pedagog- 
ical difficulties which were not met with in the smaller 
schools of former years. The larger the percentage 
of the population brought into the school, the less 
select the student body; that is, the larger the number 
/ of pupils who find the exacting work of mathematics 
difficult, hence uninviting. This aspect of the problem 
is augmented by the further fact that a large ele- 
ment of the student body is not seriously intent upon 
study. Naturally, a subject whose exactions cannot 
readily be escaped will be irksome to such students. 
Two views may be taken of this condition brought 
about by lowered mental level and weakened morale.  
-P-A-G-E-251
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 233 
One leads to the suggestion that secondary mathe- 
matics be optional altogether or that the amount be 
largely diminished. The other view leads to the pro- 
posal to make the course easier by eliminating the 
more difficult portions and making the remaining ma- 
terial as concrete as possible. 
A misconception of objectives—A second reason for 
the unsatisfactéry status of the subject is poor teach- 
ing. Possibly in the average high school no other 
study is as poorly taught. The explanation is found 
in a prevalent misconception of value, on the part 
both of teachers and of critics. The objective set up, 
at least generally, is immediate utility. The tradi- 
tional view is that algebra and geometry, like arith- 
metic, are ‘‘practical’’ subjects in the sense of being 
immediately available in the vocations. But, as a 
matter of fact, any other subject in the curriculum 
has more applicability than either algebra or ge- 
ometry. Their values are to be found elsewhere—in 
their disciplines and culture, rather than in the value 
of their content or their logical necessity to other 
studies. It is true that the science of geometry is 
rooted in vocational origins. It began in Egypt in 
connection with the annual farm surveys made nec- 
essary by the overflow of the Nile, and there and else- 
where in connection with the solution of construction 
problems which arose with the development of archi- 
tecture and other construction work. While a simple 
body of geometrical knowledge was thus developed, 
geometry as a science was elaborated by the Greeks 
while under the scientific impulse. Their interest in 
the subject was purely intellectual. They were con-
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
cerned with it as pure science, not as an art. And 
the subject remains a pure science. While many prac- 
tical applications are possible, its motive is strictly 
scientific and its method logical. The teacher must 
necessarily have this point of view, and must under- 
stand that his methods and objectives are conditioned 
by the fact that he is dealing with pure science, that its 
controlling motive is strictly scientific, and that its 
outstanding educational values are to be found in the 
form of scientific training. 
The motive in arithmetic—Arithmetic grew up 
entirely as a practical subject. Its motive, histor- 
ically and inherently, is vocational. It began as count- 
ing for the immediately useful purpose of numbering 
property. With the development of industry each 
new occupation created its own particular arithmetic. 
Thus, for the greater part of history, there have been 
as many arithmetics as there were trades, including 
the profession of public entertainment which devel- 
oped for obvious reasons puzzle arithmetic, the bane 
of the school boy. It is only recently that the various 
trade arithmetics were gathered together in one vol- 
ume and made a subject of school study. While the 
pedant presents strong claims for its value as disci- 
pline, the motive of arithmetic remains predominantly 
vocational, although such utility evidently is much 
over-rated. 
The motive in algebra—In the case of algebra there 
never was any serious vocational motive. Its inter- 
ests, conceptions, methods, objectives and history have 
been consistently scientific. In all textbooks there is 
an effort to apply algebraic processes to the solution
-P-A-G-E-253
  
    
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 235 
of practical problems, but such application is a matter 
of extension of arithmetic rather than of vocational 
functioning of algebra. Certain instrumental values 
are available in the use of algebraic processes in en- 
gineering and physical science. On the whole, how- 
ever, algebra is a pure science, consistently scientific 
in its motive and its value. 
The nature of mathematical studies—It is necessary 
to the realization of the values inhering in algebra 
and geometry, and therefore to proper methods, to un- 
derstand that they are form rather than content stud- 
ies, disciplines rather than instrumentalities, and con- 
trolled predominantly by the motive of pure science. 
Historically, they were developed as so much truth 
to be acquired for its own sake. This was the objec- 
tive of the early mathematicians, and it is the ob- 
jective which to-day secures the best values either as 
disciplines or as utilities. The assumption in this dis- 
cussion is that the motive of pure science, the desire 
to acquire mathematical truth for its own sake, is 
the motive with which the teacher must work in order 
to get worth-while results; that values to be secured — 
are primarily intellectual disciplines, and that prac- 
tical utilities are incidental, although real. 
Their sequence—The sequence of arithmetic, algebra 
and geometry is largely arbitrary. The conventional 
order is neither historically nor pedagogically neces- 
sary. Algebra can be taught with knowledge of 
merely the fundamental processes of arithmetic, and 
geometry can be taught without a knowledge of either 
of the other subjects. The value of arithmetic in daily 
life is sufficient reason for making it first in the se-
-P-A-G-E-254
  236 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ries. It matters little which of the remaining two is 
taken up next. The proposal to combine them into 
one general course, except in the junior high school, 
has received scant encouragement. It has not worked 
out well experimentally, and besides is pedagogically 
inadvisable. As will be seen in a subsequent para- 
graph, algebra and geometry deal with differ- 
ent subject matter and employ different mental pro- 
cesses. It does not seem feasible to combine them 
into any sort of a unity without totally destroying 
their scientific value, to say nothing of losing the ad- 
vantage of concentration. 
Disciplinary and cultural values—It was indicated 
above that the educational values in mathematics are 
primarily disciplinary and cultural. Possibly no other 
subject in the secondary curriculum is better fitted in 
its very nature for the development of valuable mental 
habits. Mathematical study is progressive, advanc- 
ing by steady, even gradations, producing breadth 
and depth of the mind. It trains the mind to 
‘exact and progressive thinking, to adequacy of con- 
ception and precision of expression, to energy of 
attention, to clearness of inner vision, to the percep- 
tion of necessary truths.’?? It quickens the scientific 
conscience, and is in itself ‘‘a school of scientific think- 
ing, terminology, and expression.’’ 
A necessary instrument in all investigation—Math- 
ematical study also is necessary as an instrument in 
all scientific investigation. De Garmo says: ‘‘The 
world is so constituted that it cannot be apprehended 
without some means for discovering and measuring 
1CuHaARLes Dr Garo, “The Studies of the Secondary School.”
-P-A-G-E-255
  
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 237 
its quantitative relations.’’1 Again, he says: ‘‘It 
is when we examine the relation of mathematics to 
science, both pure and applied, that we see most forci- 
bly its indispensability as a propedeutic. Astronomy 
was once studied almost exclusively as a mathemati- 
cal science, as in the days of Copernicus, Kepler, 
and Newton, and still has its mathematical side. So 
dependent is any precise and advanced study of phys- 
ics upon mathematics that it is to be reckoned at 
once as a mathematical science, though, as will be 
seen later, physics has important aspects of educa- 
tional worth not found in mathematics. ‘With chem- 
istry the dependence upon mathematics is much less, 
though here we have the laws of constant relations, 
multiple proportions, chemical formulas and equa- 
tions. In history we have chronology; in sociology, 
statistics; in esthetics, laws of proportion and sound; 
and in psychophysics, quantitative measurements of 
stimulus and response. High school algebra and ge- 
ometry and trigonometry supply in large measure the 
quantitative laws which are applied in architecture, 
sculpture, engineering, military science, and naviga- 
tion. It is through well-selected problems for solu- 
tion that the student is made fully conscious of the 
intimate dependence of many pure and applied 
sciences upon the mathematics even of the high school; 
and this consciousness of practical worth often out- 
weighs with the youth all the mental values of which 
he may hear, but of which he has no adequate con- 
ception.’’ ?

  238 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Algebra 
The science of number processes—Algebra may be 
defined as the science of number processes. As a 
science, it treats of abstract numbers, distinguished 
from arithmetic which deals with the application of 
numbers. It also deals with universalized numbers 
while arithmetic deals with what we may call par- 
ticularized numbers. The latter is limited in its scope 
to particularized, applied, positive and rational num- 
bers. The former is free of all limitations, and em- 
braces all numbers and possible number processes. 
It may be defined as the science of universalized, posi- 
tive and negative, rational and imaginary numbers. 
Algebra, on the other hand, is concerned with number 
processes and relations rather than with numbers as 
such. The algebraic expression, unlike the arithmet- 
ical expression, indicates a process to be performed 
rather than a result. This concept of number process 
as the central subject matter of algebra is essential 
for the teacher. It affords the effective point of view, 
the point of departure in algebraic thought. 
The expression ‘‘a + b’’ represents primarily a proc- 
ess to be performed rather than a quantity, just as 
an equation indicates that if certain operations are 
performed, the results will be identical. ‘‘Zero’’ 
means the point of departure or the point from which 
one measures off a portion of an immeasurable se- 
ries. The positive term directs that the measurement 
shall be made in one direction from this zero point, 
the negative term requires that it shall be made in 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 239 | 
the opposite direction, and thus it is with the whole 
subject matter. Quantities are dealt with merely as 
involved in processes. Definitions and statements of 
principle best develop working concepts by offering 
their explanations in terms of processes. Algebra is 
abstract because the number process is considered as 
a fact in itself, apart from all applications to things. 
It is universalized not only in considering the series 
in both directions from the point of departure, but in 
proposing a situation which will be satisfied with any 
and all zero points. The process is universalized by 
the use of symbols which are good for any or all pos- 
sible numerical values. It is this treatment of num- 
ber processes in an abstract universalized relation 
which constitutes the essential characteristic of alge- 
braic science, and makes it a science of thought rather 
than of things. It is this characteristic which makes 
it, as a subject of study, so difficult for the immature 
mind, and so likely to be poorly taught. 
The objective in the study of algebra—The function 
of the study of algebra is to give facility in abstract 
or symbolized thinking. Its business is to afford the 
pupil experience in ‘algebraic processes, which means 
experience in analytic-synthetic processes of thought 
with reference to an abstract universalized subject 
matter. So far as the subject is concerned, this ob- 
jective is attained by making the pupil expert in the 
processes. In terms of pedagogical values, the aim 
is to habituate the pupil to the method of thought 
involved in algebraic processes, to raise him above the 
level of one-dimensional thinking, to free him from 
bondage to the here and the now, and from bondage 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  240 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to things—to universalize his mind. Oliver Wendell 
Holmes has made the final distinction between the 
arithmetical and the algebraic mind. It is the lat- 
ter which makes for real thinking and fits the indi- 
vidual for truly scientific effort. It is proper to claim 
for algebra that no other discipline of the school 
serves the same function. There is no substitute. 
The elimination of algebra as a pure science from 
the curriculum would cut the foundation from under 
all scientific procedure and deprive the individual of 
the only possible experience in that variety of thinking 
which is the essence of intellectual freedom and effi- 
ciency. 
The first point of emphasis—The foregoing definition 
of algebra and of the objective of instruction in this 
branch of mathematics indicates where the emphasis 
shall be placed. It is necessary, as said above, that 
all algebraic ideas be presented in terms of processes 
or of indicated processes. It will be impossible for 
the student to proceed intelligently unless he gets an 
adequate mastery of the working concepts, as posi- 
tive and negative quantities, zero, rational and imag- 
inary numbers, the equation, ratio. These concepts 
must be made very clear to him; they must possess 
reality for him. They should be developed induc- 
tively from a wealth of concrete cases. All of the 
good texts will afford suggestions for effective les- 
sons with this purpose in mind. Our object here is 
to emphasize the necessity of doing this part of the 
task well. If the pupil is given the proper conceptual 
basis of algebraic science, he will have little difficulty
-P-A-G-E-259
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 241 
with the subject, and besides will find it full of mean- 
ing and, therefore, of personal interest. 
The second point of emphasis—A second feature to 
be emphasized is the performing of algebraic opera- 
tions whether in abstract exercise material or in solu- 
tion of problems. Asa matter of convenience we may 
distinguish between pure and applied algebra, by the 
former meaning the discussion of principles and work- 
ing of abstract exercises involving the operation of 
these principles, and by the latter meaning the prob- 
lem material incorporated in the text for algebraic 
solution. As between the two kinds of material, the 
former—the formal exercises—deserves the greater 
emphasis because it frees the pupil’s mind from ccn- 
erete limitations and gives a purer exercise in alge- 
braic thinking. Much more exercise also will be se- 
cured for the same reason. 
The so-called applied algebra, as stated once before, 
is really for the most part an extension of arithmetic 
into the secondary school, and has little value for the 
pupil so far as obtaining the unknown number is con- 
cerned. As a rule, the equations are so simple that 
their solution is too easy to offer real mental exercise. 
The value is secured in the process of developing the 
equation. 
Method of developing the equation—There are two 
methods of developing the equation :— 
The Trial and Error Method. 
The Analytic Method. 
The former has no educational value and, therefore, 
should not be employed. It involves the symbolizing
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the ‘‘unknown’’ quantity and the combination and 
recombination of the ‘‘known’’ quantities into equa- 
tions until one is found, the solution of which gives the 
desired result. The analytic method, as the term im- 
plies, employs the truly algebraic method of thought. 
In this mode of attack, the pupil first resolves the 
statement of the problem into its two or more com- 
parisons of quantities. It uses one comparison for 
the purpose of symbolizing the several quantities in- 
volved in the situation. The other comparison, or 
comparisons, are converted into one or more equa- 
tions, depending upon the nature of the problem, by 
merely restating the comparison in the symbolic lan- 
guage acquired from the first equation. To illustrate; 
in the problem, 
“What are two numbers, one of which is twice the 
other, whose sum is 12?’’ 
The situation alleged resolves itself into two state- 
ments or comparisons: 
(1) One number equals twice the second, 
(2) The sum of the two numbers equals 12. 
Selecting (1) for the purpose of symbolizing the 
numbers we obtain the following: 
(a) If we represent the first number by M, then 
the second will be represented by 14M. Or, 
(b) If we let M represent the second number, then 
the first number will be represented by 2M. 
Using the (2) for the equation and substituting the 
symbols in (a), we obtain 
(c) M+ %M=12, or 
12— M= 164M, or 
12—4%M= M
-P-A-G-E-261
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 243 
Substituting the symbols in (b) we obtain 
(d) 2M+M=12, or 
12 — 2M = M, or 
12— M=2M. 
The pupil then solves for the numerical values of the 
symbols chosen. Since the pupil is working not for 
the two unknown numbers, but for experience in the 
resolution of problem situations and the development 
of equations, it is important to have him exhaust the 
possibilities of each problem. The amount of exer- 
cise and not the saving of time is of primary consid- 
eration. 
Another illustration: 
Problem :—‘‘A man left an estate of $12,000 to be 
divided between, his three sons in such amounts that 
the share of the second son was three-fourths that of 
his elder brother and three-fifths that of the younger. 
What did each receive?’’ 
Analysis: 
(1) The first statement gives the total of the three 
shares; 
(2) The second statement compares the three 
shares; the second share = 4 of the first and % of the 
third. 
Selecting (2) for symbolizing the shares and using 
the second as the basis of comparison, we obtain: 
(a) Share of second son equals X 
(b) Share of first son equals 4X 
(c) Share of third son equals 4X. 
Substituting these symbols in the first statement we 
obtain the equation: 
X+%4X + 4X = $12,000
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
or, using the first son’s share as the basis of com- 
parison we obtain: 
(a) First son’s share equals X 
(b) Second’s share equals 4X 
(c) Third son’s share equals %X. 
with the resulting equation: 
X+ 4X + 4X = $12,000 
or, using the younger son as the basis of comparison, 
we obtain: 
(a) Third son’s share equals X 
(b) Second son’s share equals 4X 
(c) First son’s share equals %X. 
with the resulting equation: 
A+ %X + %X = $12,000 
The pupil should be encouraged to seek out for him- 
self these several methods of stating the equation. 
It is important also for him to understand clearly, 
in the preceding statements of symbols of the un- 
known quantities, that the word ‘‘equals’’ really means 
“is represented by,’’ and does not express equality, 
and that the several symbols do not represent so many 
dollars but are verbal substitutes for the purpose of 
facilitating the thinking process. Nor is the 12000 
so many dollars; it is an abstract expression. The 
concept ‘‘dollars’’? does not appear until the con- 
clusion is reached. 
Checking work—In the very beginning of the subject 
the pupil should be taught to check his work, and 
vigorously, required thereafter to test the result of 
every solution. The independence of thought thus 
developed is invaluable. For this reason it is advis-
-P-A-G-E-263
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 245 
able that the textbook shall not contain answers, and 
that the use of answer-books be forbidden. 
To summarize the foregoing discussion, algebra is 
an abstract science of number processes, universalized 
in content through the use of symbols which indicate 
the processes and relations considered. Chief em- 
phasis should be placed on (1) the development of a 
proper conceptual basis, (2) practice in algebraic proc- 
esses, (3) the algebraic solution of problems, involving 
(a) Analysis of the situation into the sets of in- 
volved comparisons; 
(b) Using one or more sets of these comparisons for 
deriving appropriate symbols of quantities; 
(ce) Using the remaining set or sets of comparisons 
to formulate equations; 
(d) Testing results by appropriate checks. 
Geometry 
A pure science—Geometry in its present form is a 
pure science; that is, it is a body of truth which is 
acquired and communicated primarily for its own 
sake. Its significance for education is derived from 
the fact that it is the science of space, which is the 
universal language of scientific discrimination. As a 
“form of thought’’ the concept of space furnishes the 
ground of modern science; it supplies the form in 
which other scientific concepts are formulated and ex- 
pressed. It provides the vocabulary for the expres- 
sion of other sciences. In a sense, it is alphabetic in 
its relation to other sciences, and thus fundamental in 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  
246 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
scientific training. All other sciences are conceived in 
terms of space, the subject matter of geometry. 
The foundation of philosophical study laid—For this 
reason, the study of geometry has a high instrumental 
value in its preparation for the study of other sci- 
ences, particularly the physical and earth sciences. It 
also lays the foundation of all philosophical study. 
Its vocational value is small and its conventional 
worth but little greater. In common with all scientific 
studies, its liberalizing function is large. It is truly 
a cultural subject, although taking lower rank in this 
respect than the humanities. It is in the definiteness 
and supreme value of the discipline it gives that ge- 
ometry is of most worth to the majority of its stu- 
dents. It affords the mind a specific training in log- 
ical processes. If properly taught, it develops the 
ability and habit of straight thinking, and in respect 
of this function it has no substitute. Geometry is 
supplementary to algebra in the discipline involved. 
It cannot be omitted from the secondary program 
without depriving the pupil of those concepts which 
are fundamental in science, and of the only definite 
experience in strictly logical procedure available in 
the high school. 
Two objectives—The objectives in the teaching of 
geometry are two: the development of the space con- 
cept, and the training of the pupil in logical think- 
ing. The first of these is accomplished through or- 
ganizing the instruction to conform to the psychology 
of space ideas. The second end is secured through 
exercise in syllogistic reasoning. Our concept of 
spacé is derived from perception of its relational as-
-P-A-G-E-265
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 247 
pects as experienced in movement. Distance is con- 
ceived as the amount of movement from one point to 
another. Direction is movement this way and that. 
Infinity means that no limit has been found to our 
movement. This fact of the origin of our space con- 
cept in the experience of movement gives the point 
of departure in the development of spatial definitions. 
Hence, the best way of developing a geometrical fact 
is through movement. A line is a moving point. The 
plane is developed by a moving line. A solid is de- 
veloped by a moving plane. An angle is developed 
by revolving a line about a fixed point as an axis. 
Two principles of study—Geometry is a concrete 
universalized science. It is concrete from the fact 
that it always deals with a particular space which is 
definitely limited. It is universalized in the fact that 
the particular space considered is’representative of 
any number of other particular spaces of which the 
characteristics named are true. The first of these 
principles requires that the pupil shall deal with a 
particular space definitely indicated in a perceived 
figure or as definitely conceived in his imagination. 
The second requires that at all times he shall recog- 
nize that the particular figure chosen is representative 
of an indefinite number of cases involving the same 
space facts. That is, the pupil must first see the space 
that is under discussion; not the lines which bound 
the space, but the space which is bounded by the lines. 
In the proposition ‘‘The sum of the interior angles — 
of a triangle is equal to two right angles,’’ the pupil 
must perceive a triangle, the three interior angles and 
the two right angles, and conceive the problem to re-
-P-A-G-E-266
    
248 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
late to the equality of the sums of the two groups 
of angles. That is, he must see the three angles fitted 
together to coincide with two adjacent right angles. 
Unless the pupil’s mind does thus concretely conceive 
the particular space under discussion his argument 
will be wholly barren of meaning for him. The fail- 
ure of the school at this point completely destroys any 
possible value of the subject. The second require- 
ment is no less vital. Unless the pupil realizes that 
the figure suggested by the teacher or textbook is only 
one of a countless possible number which will satisfy 
the conditions of the proposition equally well, he will 
miss the universal concept which gives the subject its 
scientific value. 
The demonstration a process of logical thinking— 
These two principles constitute one of two conditions 
of effective teaching of geometry. The other condi- 
tion is that the demonstration shall be a process of 
logical thinking and not a memory exercise. To cause 
or permit the pupil to memorize the model given in 
the book and to offer a repetition of this demonstra- 
tion as a recitation exercise is an unpardonable waste 
of time and energy. If the pupil does not think out 
his proofs and give them syllogistic form he will get 
no discipline of thought whatever from the exercise. 
It probably would greatly facilitate the proper teach- 
ing of geometry if the textbooks omitted demonstra- 
tions altogether, presenting all exercises as original, 
or even if the textbook was entirely discarded. If 
the conventional textbook is in use, the best plan to 
follow will be to have the class work out the proofs 
in their own way, approximating the syllogistic form
-P-A-G-E-267
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 249 
as nearly as possible, and then compare the class ef- 
fort with the finished argument in the text for con- 
firmation or correction. The only proper employment 
of memory in a demonstration is in the recall of re- 
lated facts which have been established in former ex- 
ercises. 
In order that the space facts already established 
shall be readily available in the discussion of a new 
proposition it is well to organize the accumulated 
knowledge by associating the related facts. Thus the 
class. may be repeatedly asked to state all that has 
been learned about parallel lines, about triangles, 
about perpendicular lines, about circles. 
The learning process involved in geometry—The 
mental process in a geometrical demonstration in- 
volves six steps: 
1. Conceiving the figure, that is, the space to be 
considered as delineated in the figure. 
2. Abstraction of a particular feature for considera- 
tion. The textbook ordinarily does this in the prop- 
osition submitted. 
3. Analysis of the figure and related memories for 
suggestions as to proof. 
4, Elimination of irrelevant facts and seizing of 
facts germane to the question at issue. 
5. Synthesis of these elements to form a conclusion. 
6. Arrangement of the several judgments in logical 
sequence leading up to the Q. E. D. 
Illustration—An illustration of the treatment of a 
proposition: first of all, we suggest that the pupils do 
not procure their textbooks in plane geometry for the 
first month. To introduce the subject from the black-
-P-A-G-E-268
  250 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
board will make it more certain that the pupils de- 
velop a proper habit of approach. Second, the teacher 
must remember that geometry is a concrete science in 
the sense that it deals at a given time with a definitely 
limited portion of space, and is universalized by keep- 
ing the pupil conscious of the fact that the particular 
portion of space under discussion is a type of an in- 
finite number of cases. 
In the study of the proposition, 
“The sum of the interior angles of a triangle 
equals a straight angle or two right angles,’’ the 
following is the form of analysis and synthesis 
to be employed; 
1. What kind of figure is referred to? A trian- 
gle. 
2. What kind of a triangle? Any. 
3. And this means? Every triangle. All triangles. 
4. In this proposition to what is referred, the sides 
of the triangle or the space bounded by the sides? 
The space contained within the lines. 
5. What do you observe to be true of the triangle 
before you? (Of the space delimited.) 
6. What assertion does the proposition make with 
reference to this space? 
7. Is the statement true? Can you prove it? 
8. Have you the two right angles for purpose of 
comparison? How will you procure them? 
9. What methods of comparing angles have we dis- 
covered in former lessons? Which of these, if any, 
are applicable to this figure? 
10. What changes in, or additions to the figure, do 
you suggest for purpose of comparison?
-P-A-G-E-269
    
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 251 
11. The pupil suggests the figure ABC with 
  DE drawn parallel to AC through B, constructing a 
straight angle on the under side of DE and also pro- 
ducing a situation involving parallel lines cut by trans- 
versals. 
12. In the above figure observe all of the compari- 
sons which can be made. Quote authority for each 
judgment. 
13. What synthesis can you make of these several 
judgments? 
14. Is the construct DE the only one possible in this 
figure? Draw all other possible constructs which will 
satisfy the principle employed in proof. 
15. Another pupil suggests a different modification 
of the figure: Extend AC producing the straight 
angle ACD on the upper side of the line and construct 
CE parallel to AB, creating a different situation in- 
volving the same relationships. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  252 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
16. What other modifications of the figure may be 
made? The pupils make other drawings until the 
possibilities of the case are exhausted. 
17. Examine your argument again. Is there any 
flaw in it? Any judgment which may be questioned? 
Any statement which may not be fortified by demon- 
strated facts? 
18. Selecting any of the figures before you, arrange 
the several statements in your argument in progres- 
sive order leading without a break to your conclusion, 
referring at each step to the authority for your judg- 
ment. 
19. Examine your argument to find whether your 
English is perfect; whether you have employed the 
right words, all that were needed, and none that were 
not needed. 
20. Compare your demonstration with the proof 
given by your author. What do you find? 
21. Restate all that you know about triangles. 
The preceding plan of discussion involves the idea 
of the exhaustive treatment of each proposition. To 
many readers this may seem to demand too much time 
and attention to detail. But in the long run it will 
be found to be economical of time and energy. Be- 
sides, the object in the teaching of the subject is the 
development of logical ability, which requires the 
habit of exhaustive analysis as well as originality. 
Judd’s definition in ‘‘Psychology of High School Sub- 
jects’’ gives a safe rule for guidance; ‘‘Geometry is 
rather the science of finding out all that can be dis- 
covered with regard to the characteristics of spatial
-P-A-G-E-271
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 253 
figures.’? The teacher should be patient, especially 
in the introduction of the subject. Here, as in other 
connections, he who is faithful over a few small things 
in the beginning will in due time be made ruler over 
the many and the larger. 
Learning technical terms—It is quite essential that 
the pupils be trained to the proper use of the techni- 
cal terms employed in geometry. These words ex- 
press ideas which are vital to thought processes and 
which other words do not adequately express. Much 
confusion arises in the minds of the pupils because of 
carelessness in this respect. Such apparently famil- 
iar terms as vertical, perpendicular, parallel, homolo- 
gous, adjacent, interior, exterior, infinite, are new to 
most of the class, and will seriously cripple the pupil’s 
thinking unless their meanings are thoroughly mas- 
tered. The reader is referred to the discussion of 
this question in the chapter on English. 
Practical applications—Some teachers have felt that 
there is a pedagogical necessity for making practical 
applications of geometrical knowledge. Considerable 
effort has been made in recent years to work out a 
practical geometry. But if we are correct in the as- 
sumption at the beginning of this discussion, that ge- 
ometry as now organized is a pure science and its 
motive is purely intellectual, and, further, that its 
educational values are primarily disciplinary, we need 
not be disturbed by the modern demand for immediate 
utility. Smith thinks that the present movement “will 
not greatly change geometry, because no serious per- 
son ever believed that geometry was taught chiefly
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
for practical purposes, or was made more interesting 
or valuable through such a pretence.’’* 
Observation of spatial figures—In a former para- 
graph considerable emphasis was placed on the di- 
rect observation of the characteristics of spatial 
figures as fundamental in accurate geometrical think- 
ing. In plane geometry this is easily done, but in 
solid geometry a peculiar difficulty of many pupils 
must be overcome, namely their inability to ‘‘see’’ 
the solid. Two methods are employed to assist the 
pupil in overcoming this difficulty; the use of models, 
and of accurately made drawings. The problem is 
to develop the pupil’s power of imagination, and the 
habit of using his imagination to embody the spatial 
facts under discussion. The following quotation from 
Schultze? with reference to the psychological prob- 
lem of imagery presents the question clearly: ‘‘One 
difficulty, however, against which we must guard and 
which we must overcome at the very start is the in- 
ability of some students who are able to reason log- 
ically, but who cannot imagine clearly the spatial 
forms which the diagrams represent. There are two 
ways of overcoming this difficulty, namely, the use of 
models and rational methods of drawing. 
Use of Models—‘‘The function of the model is to 
help the student in the beginning to an understanding 
of solid figures in general, and to make clear to him, 
later on, difficult drawings which otherwise he would 
not understand. The model should, however, not be

2ScnuttzeE, Artuur, “The Teaching of Mathematics in Secondary 
Schools.”—The Macmillan Co., New York.
-P-A-G-E-273
HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 255 
used to supplant the drawing. As soon as the student 
is able to understand the drawings, the models should 
be discarded or reserved for the most difficult cases 
only. Otherwise the student will lose one of the main 
benefits of the study, namely, the development of his 
space imagination and of his faculty to understand 
diagrams of solids.’’ ? 
Difficulties to overcome—The teacher will find three 
other types of difficulty to overcome, arising from the 
fact that there are three varieties of mental experi- 
ence involved in geometry, and ordinarily in every 
demonstration, and that the pupil quite often gets lost 
in passing from one sphere to another. (1) The pu- 
pil frequently goes astray in not seeing clearly what 
is given, and what he has to prove. He sees the facts 
of the figure and is quite certain that they are true, 
but he cannot conceive a reason for their being true. 
He gets lost in passing from the perception of the 
spatial facts to logical demonstration of their neces- 
sity. (2) In the second place, he may readily con- 
ceive the reason for a fact and be able to state ab- 
stractly what the fact must be, but is unable to see the 
fact in the figure. He gets lost in passing from log- 
ical demonstration to observation and portrayal of 
facts in the figure. (3) The third difficulty is more 
perplexing to the teacher. It is involved in the case 
of the pupil who knows the rules of procedure in ge- 
ometrical construction without knowing the reason 
therefor. It is the divorce of the practical mode of 
thinking from the theoretical. Professor Judd has 
1Scuutrze, Arrnur, “Teaching of Mathematics in Secondary 
Schools.”
-P-A-G-E-274
  256 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
handled these situations so helpfully that his dis- 
cussion is quoted at length: ‘‘How does imagery dif- 
fer from reasoning? Why is it more difficult to imag- 
ine solid figures than to imagine planes? Is it true 
that one of the functions of geometry as taught in the 
schools is to cultivate the power of imagery? It is 
interesting to note that the experience of schools shows 
that students are deficient. Why should we be more 
deficient in these matters than the Greeks or the 
Japanese? Is it not because the school has left space 
to develop as best it can in the mind of the student 
without the legitimate help which would come from 
instruction in spatial relations all through the period 
of education prior to that in which the student en- 
counters high-school geometry? If so fundamental a 
power as the interpretation of a drawing of a solid is 
lacking in high-school students, is it probable, in the 
light of experience, that a course in demonstrative 
geometry administered in the high school will cure the 
difficulty? Is it not rather the duty of the school to 
put into the elementary course at an early point, some 
constructive geometry? Indeed, it seems very clear 
to the unbiased student that it is to the interest of the 
geometrician himself that he be persuaded to look 
about for ways of cultivating space imagery which are 
more efficient than those afforded in the logical courses 
now offered in demonstrative geometry.’ + 
Summary 
The current confusion with regard to the place of 
mathematics in the secondary program is due, in part, 
1CHaArtes H. Jupp, “Psychology of High School Studies,” p. 79.
-P-A-G-E-275
  HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS 257 
to the inability of teachers to meet the demand that 
every subject in the curriculum shall justify itself, 
and, in part, to the admission of a large student body 
of the nonacademic type. Some are misled also by 
the notion that immediate utility is the only ground of 
admission of a subject to the curriculum. 
Mathematics, with the exception of arithmetic, must 
be justified largely on other grounds than practical 
utility. The motive in arithmetic is vocational; the 
motive in algebra and geometry, historically and in- 
herently, is scientific. The approach must be scien- 
tific. 
A course in general mathematics is advised for the 
junior high school. In the senior high school the tra- 
ditional specialized courses are more satisfactory. 
Mathematical study has large disciplinary values 
but it is also necessary as an instrument in all scien- 
tific investigations. 
The objective in algebra is to afford the pupil ex- 
perience in algebraic processes, which means exper- 
ience in analytic-synthetic processes of thought with 
reference to an abstract universalized subject matter. 
The objective determines the point of emphasis, (1) 
working concepts, (2) the inductive approach, and (3) 
practice in algebraic processes. 
Geometry lays the foundation for all philosophical 
study. Its objectives are (1) the development of the 
space concept and (2) the training of the pupil in 
logical thinking. 
Two principles of study must be observed in ge- 
ometry: (1) The pupil must deal in each instance 
with a definitely conceived particular space, and at the 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  258 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
same time (2) realize that this space is representa- 
tive of an infinite number of other particular spaces 
involving the same space facts. 
The demonstration is to be an exercise in logical 
thinking, and not a mere memory exercise. 
Attention should be given to the organization of 
accumulated knowledge by associating the related 
facts. 
The terminology of mathematics should be care- 
fully taught as a means to clear thinking as well as to 
economy of time. 
Geometry, as now organized, is a pure science, and 
its motive purely intellectual: we need not be dis- 
turbed by the recurrent demand for immediate utility. 
A difficult function of the teacher of geometry is 
the development in his pupils of the power and the 
habit of using the imagination to embody the spatial 
facts under discussion.

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 
It was observed in the chapter on Educational Val- 
ues that high school physics has certain preparatory 
functions. It was also suggested in the general dis- 
cussion of science instruction that this subject log- 
ically comes first after mathematics in the sequence of 
science studies in the curriculum. Physics _ is nec- 
istry, and. quite essential to proper conceptions it in a 
tronomy, and in the biological and earth sciences. 
Heological processes in plants and animals are largely 
mechanical, and require a knowledge of elementary 
principles of physics for-their- understanding» Like- 
wise, in the case of the forces-at-work-in the changing 
of land and water forms, and the action of air, water 
and heat. The study of physical geography and ge- 
ology presupposes elementary physics. Its prepar- 
atory relation to mechanics and all branches of en- 
gineering is generally recognized. 
Vocational value of physics is high—The vocational 
value of this subject is especially high. No other 
study in the high school curriculum, with the excep- 
tion of English, has so much practical utility for all 
classes of people. With the increasing use of labor 
saving machinery, this utility is growing. The al- 
260
-P-A-G-E-279
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 261 
most universal use of the telephone, of electric light- 
ing and power, of automobiles, gas engines, lifting 
and force pumps, feeders, tedders, farm machinery 
of all kinds, individual and community water service, 
modern methods of house-heating and ventilation, and 
of the numerous mechanical devices for doing woman’s 
work—all this enormous development in the indus- 
trial life of the people in country and city, on the 
farm and in the factory, is an application of the prin- 
ciples of physics to the essential work of the people. 
Clearly it is as necessary for the boy who wants to un- 
derstand the mechanics and operation of this vast ar- 
ray of machinery, commonplace in modern life, to 
know the elements of physical science as for the reader 
of the dailynewspaper to-know-his.alphabet. With- 
out a thorough grounding in the principles involved 
in the mechanical world, he is at the mercy of the 
repair man, and lacks the basis of knowledge neces- 
sary for efficiency in the use of these devices. This 
utility is so universal for boys that it would seem but 
the sensible thing to require all of them to pursue 
this subject one or two years. But the utility of phy- 
sics is nearly, if not quite, as great for girls. The 
planning of the house, its lighting, heating, and ven- 
tilation, cannot be done intelligently without a knowl- 
edge of the principles of reflection and refraction of 
light, the phenomena—of heat, of gases and fluids, 
The girl must know physics, if she ts-to_be intelligent 
in the use of her camera, the care of her piano, start- 
ing a grate fire, turning on the electric light, using 
a flat-iron, drying her handkerchief, to say nothing 
of regulating the gas range, the sewing machine, driv-  
-P-A-G-E-280
  
  262 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing the family car, or using the telephone. As a mat- 
ter of fact, the practical applications of physics are 
as many and important in woman’s life as in man’s, 
and it would seem as sensible to require this study 
of all girls as well as of all boys. 
The moral value in physics—The possibilities of 
moral education in the teaching of physics are so well 
stated in a paragraph by Dr. Frederick E. Kester that 
it is quoted in full: ‘‘Nor is the purely practical 
advantage, of which we hear so much in these days, 
obtained from knowledge of physical laws and prin- 
ciples through the better control of the physical phe- 
nomena surrounding us in every day life—through 
applications to engineering and to the industries— 
the only one worthy of notice‘’ In common with all 
sciences the training in physics has moral values. It 
emphasizes the fact that truth only counts toward the 
building up of science; that falsehood not only is val- 
ueless in this regardybut positively harmful, since it 
requires frequently the expenditure of more energy 
to kill it than was used to put it into existence, so that 
there is the double waste of effort which, properly 
used at the start, would have brought us far along 
in the pursuit. There is also, I believe, a develop- 
ment of conscience to be got from the careful state- 
ment of exact laws, to be got as well from the careful 
manipulation of apparatus in our laboratories. It is, 
indeed, difficult to see how a student, if he has entered 
at all into the spirit of this science, can come away from 
the study of it without an increased appreciation of 
downright honesty.’’ 
It is evident that the application of the principles
-P-A-G-E-281
  
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 263 
of gases and fluids to the problems of house ventila- 
tion and sanitation, to the movements of the air, and 
particularly of heavy gases in city streets, may be 
made to contribute greater intelligence with regard 
to the public health. 
\(Physics liberalizes the mind—The sentimental and 
reconstructive values of physics are very slight if at 
all appreciable, but the contribution of this study, 
when pursued in a masterly way, to the liberalizing 
of the mind is excelled by but one or two other studies, 
if by any. A mastery of the elementary facts and 
principles of mechanics, heat, light, fluids and elec- 
tricity gives one the key to the understanding and con- 
trol of his physical environment. Particularly is this 
true, if through proper field study and efficient lab- 
oratory practice, the individual has acquired skill in the 
handling of mechanical appliances and situations., Af- 
ter all, a man’s feeling of self-confidence and his free- 
dom in action are based on the sense of physical compe- 
tency, The mastery of the mechanical environment 
greatly increases the man’s physical competency, and, 
therefore, the forcefulness of his personality and the 
freedom of his activity. Looking at the matter from 
the strictly psychological point of view, this is one of 
the most valuable results of the study of physics.” 
The disciplinary values of high school physics, as in 
fact of all sciences, and for that matter of all studies, 
depend upon the method of teaching employed. If 
the subject is treated as so much material for a 
memory-cram, or if so presented as to fail to secure 
the self-activity of the pupil, the discipline afforded 
will be negligible. But if the teacher observes that 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  264 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
physics is both mathematical and experimental, and 
adapts her methods to conform to these characteris- 
tics, a discipline of the highest value may be realized. 
De Garmo has said: ‘‘Just as geometry may be de- 
veloped from a few self-evident propositions, or ax- 
ioms, so physics may start with facts lying within 
the immediate experience of the.student,-and-enable 
him, step by step, to construct. for himself-through his 
own experiments and _thinking..a.bodyof knowledge 
that is free from the uncertainties-of-opinion-and.au- 
“thority. Here there need be no ballast of historical 
data, dogmas, doctrines, or exceptions.’’ That is, if 
the student is led to observe the simple physical 
phenomena about him, to conceive them as problems to 
be solved, and through personal experimentation and 
rational thinking works out a solution which he per- 
sonally checks up and, establishes as a certainty, he 
will secure a strengthening of thinking ability, a more 
positive regard for truth, and the habits of analytic 
thinking and independent investigation. A year or 
two of such mental Eerie will have incalculable 
value., No other subject surpasses physics in the 
scope offered for practice in systematic original think- 
ing and true student) self-activity. In addition to 
these specific disciplines, there is the general balanc- 
ing up of the effects of literary training. Helmholtz 
has emphasized this function in the following state- 
ment: ‘‘What has been noticeable in my experience 
with students who pass from literary schools to scien- 
tific and medical studies, is, first, a certain laxity in 
the application of laws that are universally valid. 
The grammatical rules upon which they have been
-P-A-G-E-283
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 265 
exercised are, in fact, accompanied by long lists of 
exceptions, and the students are consequently unac- 
customed to trust to the certainty of the legitimate 
consequences of strictly universal laws. Second, I find 
them much inclined to rely upon authorities, even 
where they could form their own judgment. In phil- 
ological studies, even the best of teachers refer stu- 
dents to authorities, because frequently they can not 
compass the whole subject, and because the decision 
often depends upon esthetic feeling for beauty of 
expression, which demands long training. Both de- 
fects rest upon a certain inertia, indeed uncertainty 
of thinking, which will be injurious not alone in sci- 
ence studies. The best remedy for both defects lies in 
studies of a mathematical nature, for in them there is 
absolute certainty of reasoning, and no authority rules 
but that of the understanding itself.’? To this might 
be added that the problems of physics also tend to 
objectify thought, and that intelligent individual ex- 
perimentation develops independence of thinking. 
Professor C. R. Mann of the University of Chicago 
has this to say of the value of high school physics: 
“‘Physies, as a subject for high school instruction, 
has a double advantage. It is not only so intimately 
related to the pupils’ daily lives that they already 
possess a large range of concrete experiences on which 
to base their work, but it also is essentially a science 
of measurement capable of training the pupils in quan- 
titative thinking and in appreciation of the value of de- 
_ finite, quantitative knowledge. It is both concrete and 
abstract, practical and theoretical. It therefore offers 
unlimited opportunity of training pupils in the methods
-P-A-G-E-284
    | 
266 THE TEACHING om SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of thinking by which all real knowledge is obtained; 
and conversely of giving them greater control of their 
physical environment by teaching them how to apply 
the knowledge thus acquired to the world of practical 
affairs in which they live” 
Teaching Objectives 
In order to realize the educational values discussed 
above, the teacher should have the following objec- 
tives in view: | 
I. A body of ae comprising : 
1. A clear grasp of the seven ‘‘ultimate con- 
cepts’’ that form the terms in which all physical phe- 
nomena are interpreted. These concepts are Space 
and Time, Mass and Inertia, Hlectricity and Ether, 
and Energy. All ee are reducible to these 
seven. The multiform happenings of our physical en- 
vironment, whether in the field of invention or in na- 
ture at large, all are reducible in their interpretations 
into terms of these ‘‘ultimate concepts.’’ It is clear 
then that they hold the key to the understanding of 
physical phenomena and must be thoroughly mas- 
tered. 
2. The body of facts of the physical world, 
of the laws and principles governing the physical hap- 
penings about us, and constituting the body of “theo- 
retical’? physics. Particular emphasis should be 
placed on the quantitative determinations of these 
facts and principles. 
3. The knowledge objective should include also  
-P-A-G-E-285
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 267 
the applications of the principles learned in the class- 
room and laboratory, observed in the physical phe- 
nomena of nature and in the mechanical devices of 
modern life. Physics should help the pupil to under- 
stand his physical environment,/ The high school has 
too often failed at this~point, which, after all, is the 
chief function of this subject. The course should be 
counted a failure which does not give the boy a knowl- 
edge of such matters as the municipal lighting, water, 
sanitary and heating systems of his home city; a 
knowledge of power machinery, systems of communi- 
cation, devices for mechanical advantage. In fact, 
the information referred to under the first and second 
heads is desired primarily in order that the pupils 
may accomplish the results indicated in this para- 
graph. 
4. In order to acquire a grasp of any subject of 
study or problem, it is necessary to see the subject or 
problem in its historical setting. It will add greatly 
to the interest of the pupils if they may have the es- 
sential facts in the development of physics as an in- 
dividual science. Such information possibly should 
come late in the course, but should be given before the 
final summary is undertaken,/ Of much greater inter- 
est to the pupils, and of more value in their_motiva- 
tion for the subject, is the history-ef-the application 
of the principles of physics in the invention of ma-¢ 
chinery.—The history of the improvement of the 
steam engine, from its first form to the present, will 
add much to the pupil’s zest for the study and also 
increase his insight into modern engine building. The
-P-A-G-E-286
  268 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
history of telegraphy, the telephone, the camera, the 
gas and electric motor, the electric light, is a fascinat- 
ing study. 
II. There are certain skills which form the second 
objective of the teacher. These are: 
1. Skill in the analysis of physical problems, 
in determining the factors known and those to be dis- 
covered, and in finding a mode of attack. If the study 
of physics is to function educationally it must be scien- 
tific in its method. The teacher, then, must plan to 
train his pupils in the scientific approach to physical 
problems. 
2. Skill in the devising and performing of ap- 
propriate experiments. Most teachers fail at this 
point in that they dictate the experiment, selecting the 
apparatus and directing the set-up, leaving the pupil 
nothing to do but go more or less mechanically through 
the manipulation of the apparatus and write up the 
notes. The only experimentation that has tangible 
value is that in which the pupil has developed a per- 
sonal interest in a problem which he is determined to 
solve, and in which he plans and sets up the experi- 
ment that in his judgment will give the desired solu- 
tion. The good teacher will plan to develop this va- 
riety of student-ability. 
3. Skill in the manipulation of apparatus. That 
pupils need such training is obvious to any one 
who has observed their awkward attempts to handle 
strange devices. Most of the pupils, especially girls, 
come to the laboratory without any training in ma- 
nipulation. 
4. Accuracy of measurement. The average pupil
-P-A-G-E-287
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 269 
gets his first experience in accuracy in the phy- 
sics laboratory. He was not born accurate, nor have 
his other studies, with the exception of mathematics 
if he has been fortunate in securing a good teacher, 
contributed anything to this virtue. He will require 
special training in measurements. 
5. The fifth skill which the subject requires is 
in proper reporting or note-book work. For this too 
the pupil will require special training. 
III. Emotional Experience. It would seem a 
strange failure at some point if the pupil should not 
receive a positive and unique emotional experience in 
the study of the subject which holds the key to the 
interpretation of physical nature and the inventive 
genius of man. Fiction has no romance so wonderful 
as the miracles of gravitation, electricity, and light. / / 
“One must stand mute before scores of mechanisms 
which inventive genius has produced under the guid- 
ance of the physicist. Nothing in the humanities may 
stimulate the sense of wonder as do the daily lessons 
of the class in physics. The pupil whose teacher is 
philosopher and poet enough to open up the vision 
must daily exclaim ‘‘See what God hath wrought.’’ 
Quoting from Dr. Kester: ‘‘Physics presents an ad- 
mirably well organized form to the observer. That so 
great a part of the many and multiform physical hap- 
penings of our every-day life, whether they occur 
within doors or in the open, whether in the city or in 
the field, should be reducible in their interpretations 
to so few terms, is truly incitement to wonder and 
admiration. It is a point of view to which we should 
return again and again with our classes when we tire
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the detailed consideration of the laws of science.’? 
The study of the genius of man displayed in his 
marvelous machines should excite equal wonder and 
admiration. There is a poetry in man’s machines. 
A great locomotive engine speaks of vast power un- 
der control beyond portrayal in language forms. The 
great telescopes and radio-telegraphy annihilate time 
and space. The phonograph and the cinematograph 
almost reproduce life. It is a function of the teacher 
of physics to open up this world of beauty to his pu- 
pils. 
And lastly a proper course in laboratory experimen- 
tation surely must quicken the conscience, the love of 
truth, of exactness. No other subject in the curriculum 
offers better opportunity for quickening those senti- 
ments which lie back of the cardinal virtues. 
Method of Teaching 
In general the teaching process in physics should 
comprise: 
1. The presentation of facts and _ principles 
through the consideration of real problems observed 
in the pupil’s immediate environment. This step will 
involve (a) class discussion, and (b) experimentation, 
in the order named. 
2. Class discussion of the problem and exper- 
imentation should be followed by the study of those 
portions of the textbook which bear on the facts and 
principles under consideration, together with quizzes 
on the content of the textual matter, the discussion and 
experiments, and the solution of the illustrative ex-
-P-A-G-E-289
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 271 
ercises presented in the textbooks and gathered from 
other sources. 
3. The third step in the process is generaliza- 
tion in which the facts and principles are summarized 
and expressed in a formal statement. 
4, Field work, in which the pupils apply their 
newly acquired information in the explanation of the 
phenomena of their immediate natural and mechanical 
environment. : 
Best method of teaching physics—If the study of 
physics is to realize the rich values possible, it should 
get as far as possible from the dogmatic mode of 
presentation of new knowledge to which the pupil has 
thus far been subjected in the elementary school and) 
in the other studies in the high school. . So far as pos-| 
sible the method of high school science, and particu- \ 
larly of high school physics, should as that of i 
search. The teacher should regard the textbook not 
as the source of information, but rather as a manual / 
and a means whereby the pupil may verify the conclu- | | 
sions at which he has arrived in the class discussion | 
and his experimentation. It is also valuable for sup- 
plementing his insights by giving the formule and 
other results of research which are beyond his present 
powers and facilities. To assign portions of the text, 
whose content is to be memorized and reviewed in the 
class quiz one day and verified or illustrated in the 
laboratory exercise the next day, is a reversal of the 
normal mental process, and an inexcusable waste of ed- 
ucational values. It is recommended that a textbook 
be used in high school physics, if it is done without 
violating the fundamental principles of sound ped- 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
272 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
agogy; otherwise the pupils will be far better off with- 
out the book. 
-~ The normal procedure is to call attention to a phe- 
nomenon involving the fact or principle to be learned, 
which is readily observable in the immediate surround- 
ings. / By means 01 proper questioning, class discus- 
‘sion is aroused which leads to different suggestions 
as to the explanation, thus resulting in a problem 
which the pupils, if properly directed, are intent upon 
solving. The teacher should so guide the discussion 
leading up to the statement of the problem that fur- 
ther research will require the particular experiments 
necessary to a clear insight into the fact or principle 
which he desires to teach. With the problem thus 
~—~stated and the pupils rightly motivated, the class then 
repairs to the laboratory to work out their proposed 
solutions. Hach individual or group championing a 
particular theory should be required to devise the 
necessary experiment, making his own set-up as well 
as manipulating the apparatus. The teacher should 
confine his assistance to simple questions and sugges- 
tions that will prevent the pupils from wasted effort. 
The pupils should be led to criticize each other’s work 
and arrive at an agreed statement of the results. 
The second step in the teaching process is the study 
and discussion of those portions of the class text which 
present the fact or principle already discovered in the 
laboratory work, for the purpose of corroborating and 
reinforcing the information acquired. Thus the text- 
book serves the teacher as a manual or outline of the 
theory to be taught, and the pupil as a means of ver- 
ifying his own investigations and filling out his con-
-P-A-G-E-291
THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 273 
ceptions. The exercises given in the book will serve 
as further illustrations of the theory, and will develop 
skill in calculation. It may be necessary to resort to 
the laboratory to demonstrate the facts involved in 
some of these exercises. If so, the procedure should 
be the same as in the presentation step. 
It is a serious blunder to allow a study to end with- 
out requiring the class to make a generalization of 
the knowledge which they have developed, and to ex- 
press it in a formal statement. The clean-cut gen- 
eralization is necessary to intelligent procedure in the 
study of the next topic, as well as to a proper mastery 
of the principles upon which the pupils have been 
working. The development by the class of an accept- 
able statement of the generalization is necessary to 
the retention of the i caesar and 
also to facility in its use./ Many schools fail to give 
due emphasis to this step in the teaching process with 
the result that their pupils come out of the course 
with confused and loosely-organized concepts. Loose 
teaching is wholly wasteful. To fail to give the pupils 
a well-defined concept, expressed in proper language, 
is to sacrifice all of the possible values in the 
subject. 
The fourth step in the process of teaching a given 
topic is to apply the newly-discovered principle to the 
explanation of the happenings and devices in the phys- 
ical environment of the school, or in field work. The 
object of such field study is two-fold: Completing the 
learner’s mastery of the topic by means of his han- 
dling of live illustrations; but more particularly the 
mastery of so much of the physical environment.
-P-A-G-E-292
    274 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The emphasis of this phase of the lesson-whole should 
be sufficient to give the class a full understanding of 
all natural phenomena, machines, and processes which 
embody the principles in question. In this connection, 
the history of the discovery of this principle and of 
the development of its applications in human activities 
should be presented. Such historical study may take 
the form of talks by the teacher and of special reports 
by individual pupils. The high school library should 
be stocked with reference material suitable for this 
purpose. 
The Experiment 
From the foregoing it has been observed that we 
propose to make a radical change from the conven- 
tional place and function of laboratory work in the 
teaching of physics. Under the proposed organiza- 
tion of the teaching process the experiment is brought 
forward and employed as a means of developing the 
concept through problem-solving, instead of being 
used at the end of the lesson-whole merely for illustra- 
tion of concepts developed dogmatically in textbook 
study and class quiz. The experiment is to be em- 
ployed by the pupil as a means to the discovery of the 
principle rather than to illustrate it. It is involved 
in an inductive process rather than in a deductive 
process. 
The organization of the experiment should be deter- 
mined by the pupil, not by the teacher or a laboratory 
manual. It should not be a dictated exercise. The 
teacher’s function is to advise, suggest and inspire,
-P-A-G-E-293
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 275 
rather than to direct. The initiative should be with 
the pupil. If he comes to the laboratory with a def- 
inite problem in his mind, and with a purpose to find 
a solution or demonstration of his theory of its solu- 
tion, he will be sufficiently motivated to proceed on his 
own. initiative. 
Advantages of group work—Ordinarily group work 
in the laboratory is more profitable than individual 
experimentation. It is to be expected that the initial 
class discussion will divide the pupils into certain 
groups, each group taking a common point of view 
or championing the same hypothesis. Naturally such 
a group becomes the working unit. The purpose is 
a group rather than an individual purpose. The 
cause is social, and, as Judd has taught us, effective 
motive must be grounded in a social situation. Group 
work, in the majority of cases, is better than individ- 
ual work for motivation. 
Equipment—In most cases, schools are concerned 
about the equipment of the laboratory, often investing 
large sums in costly apparatus. The equipment is 
frequently so abundant and highly polished that the 
laboratory becomes the school’s show-place rather 
than its workshop. In fitting up the laboratory the 
workshop idea should not be lost sight of. The very 
first equipment to procure is well-lighted work-tables, 
a set of tools, and a supply of materials out of which 
the pupils may construct much of the needed equip- 
ment. Pedagogically, it is more valuable for the stu- 
dents to make as much of the requisite apparatus as 
possible. The only reason for the purchase of ready- 
made equipment is the saving of time.
-P-A-G-E-294
  276 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Special care should be taken to secure the highest 
possible degree of accuracy in measurements and in 
the making of records. Such care is necessary for 
the immediate success of the experimentation, and 
especially to the securing of one of the principal val- 
ues of the subject. Slovenly work is a waste of time 
and labor. Precision cannot be too much emphasized. 
The pupils should also be taught methods of check- 
ing their calculations wherever such methods are ap- 
plicable, and thereafter required to check all work 
before submitting results. 
Notebook work—Notebook work is of enough im- 
portance to warrant the teacher’s careful considera- 
tion. If the notes are confined to a description of 
the shop and manipulation of apparatus in a dic- 
tated experiment, the value derived will be very small 
indeed. If, however, the notes cover the lesson as a 
whole, as properly they should, they have an indis- 
pensable place in the teaching process. The record 
should contain a carefully-written account of each 
step in the learning process through which the pupil 
has gone, including: 
The initial observation. 
The problem suggested by this observation. 
The hypotheses proposed. 
The experiment performed. 
The set-up. 
The manipulation. 
The results. 
The conclusions developed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE TEACHING OF PHYSICS 277 
The additional information gleaned from the text- 
book. 
The history of the topic. 
The generalization. 
Applications of the principle observed in the pu- 
pil’s natural and mechanical environment. 
It will be necessary, of course, to train the pupils 
to conciseness of statement, a virtue quite worth the 
necessary effort. The English values derived from 
such exercises are not to be despised. The chief val- 
ues are clearness of conception resulting from the 
effort to produce a closely organized report, per- 
manence of memory thereby secured, and especially 
the fixing of the habit of scientific thinking. 
Summary 
Considered with reference to the preparation it af- 
fords for the understanding of other subjects, its im- 
mediate practical applications, its cultural and dis- 
ciplinary values, physics merits a prominent place in 
the study program. 
The teaching objectives in this subject are: (1) 
Knowledge of the ‘‘seven ultimate concepts,’’ the facts 
and principles constituting ‘‘theoretical physics,’’ the 
physical phenomena of nature and of the mechanical 
devices of modern life, and the history of the develop- 
ment of physics and its application in the invention

urement and records; (3) an appropriate emotional 
experience. 
The method employed should be inductive, compris- 
ing, in order, the following steps: (1) consideration 
of a Real Problem involving the facts and principles 
to be presented, including class discussion and ex- 
perimentation; (2) consultation of textbooks, quizzes, 
and solution of illustrative exercises; (3) generaliza- 
tion; (4) field work. 
The experiment should be used as a means to the 
discovery by the pupil of the fact or principle to be 
learned, not for the purpose of illustration or demon- 
stration. The pupil should think out the ‘‘set-up’’ for 
himself. 
Ordinarily group work in the laboratory is more 
profitable than individual experimentation. 
In fitting up the laboratory, the workshop idea 
should not be lost sight of. 
Very great care should be taken to secure the high- 
est possible degree of accuracy in measurements and 
the making of records. Precision can not be too much 
emphasized.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 
Much that was said of the teaching of physics in the 
high school will apply equally to chemistry. De 
Garmo has said of this subject: ‘‘An examination 
into the nature of chemistry shows it to be an in- 
ductive science essentially non-mathematical, with a 
fascinating history and a marvelous utility in mod- 
ern industry. It has been developed through count- 
less experiments, and to be effective educationally 
must be taught in the same way.’’? In objectives and 
method it is closely allied with physics. Yet they 
differ in certain essentials. 
Differences between physics and chemistry—Physics 
is mathematical; chemistry is largely non-mathemati- 
cal, and because of the nature of the phenomena with 
which it deals is wholly a laboratory study. Physics 
deals with phenomena which are open to observation 
on every hand in the natural and mechanical environ- 
ments of the pupil. Chemistry deals with happenings 
which are not thus open to observation. These ac- 
tivities must be artificially produced in order to be 
available for study. Again, chemical changes take 
place in the functioning of atoms and molecules, which 
cannot be observed by the senses; hence, these changes 
when artificially produced cannot be apprehended by 
1CHartes De Garmo, “The Studies of the Secondary School,” p. 77.

direct observation. They can be known only through 
inference from established data. The study neces- 
sarily, therefore, is a laboratory subject, and requires 
the highest order of scientific thinking. 
Chemistry, also, is somewhat more closely identi- 
fied with technology than is physics, and for this rea- 
son has a stronger attraction for those of a practical — 
disposition. 
Educational Values 
Chemistry is a prerequisite for anything more than 
a merely superficial study of the biological sciences; 
for engineering, medicine, scientific agriculture, home 
economics, sanitary science, the earth sciences, and for 
most forms of technical education. This preparatory 
function is so significant that chemistry is generally 
prescribed as a preliminary to all sciences and tech- 
nical courses. 
The practical value of chemistry—The practical value 
of the subject is beyond measure. Its utility is well 
stated by Prof. J. E. Mills: ‘‘Chemistry in the high 
school should be made a wonderfully interesting 
study and a study that would contribute a lasting 
interest to life; but this is only one part of the story. 
Each man’s present life, as he lives it under the con- 
ditions of our modern civilization, has been made pos- 
sible only by the knowledge of chemistry which the 
world has come to possess. A knowledge of chem- 
istry has made possible the production of iron from 
its ores, and every step of civilization has been de- 
pendent upon that knowledge. But that industry is. 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  282 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
only one of a hundred industries dependent upon a 
knowledge of chemistry for their existence or for their 
present perfection. The production of copper and 
silver and lead and tin and zine from their ores, and 
the winning of gold, are dependent upon chemical proc- 
esses. The chemist explains how best to produce 
brick, and cement, and mortar, and concrete, for the 
purpose in view. He supervises the manufacture of 
glass, of paints, and dyestuffs. He is a necessary ad- 
junct to the sugar refinery and to the soap factory. 
Not alone for the material of the printing-press, but 
for the paper and the ink as well, a debt is owing to 
the chemist. He aids the physician with his drugs 
and the farmer with his fertilizers. To his care is 
largely entrusted the carrying out of the pure-food 
law and the inspection of drinking water. The above 
are only examples. Literally in a hundred ways the 
knowledge of the chemist touches the home life of 
nearly every man, woman, and child in the United 
States. All of the chemical processes mentioned, and 
the numerous others, can be taught in no high school. 
But a foundation for further reading can and should 
be laid, and some of the simpler, and locally more im- 
portant, processes should be taught.’’ To quote once 
more from De Garmo: ‘‘A mere glimpse at the func- 
tion of chemistry in industrial life shows its immense 
practical importance; chemistry of iron and steel; re- 
duction of ores, refining of oil and sugar; manufactur- 
ing of dyes, starch, beer, wines, gas, paper, leather, 
lime, cement, soap, fertilizers, extracts; the proper 
nourishment of the human body, care of health, dis- 
infectants, sanitation; to say nothing of its first great 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 283 
function after the attempts at transmutation were 
given up, namely, the production of medicines.’’ 
It is obvious that even an elementary knowledge of 
chemistry is of great value in protecting health. It 
enables one to understand the many bulletins convey- 
ing information with regard to sanitation, pure and 
impure foods, drug adulteration, patent medicines, in- 
secticides, disinfectants, and the physiological proc- 
esses of nutrition of the human body and elimina- 
tion of body wastes. 
Its cultural values—While chemistry is not ordinarily 
considered a cultural subject, yet in the hands of a 
capable teacher whose insight reaches beyond the mere 
factual material, this study should stimulate the pu- 
pil’s sense of wonder to romantic heights. In com- 
pany with all of the sciences, chemistry reveals mar- 
vels far beyond the imaginings of romance. It is said 
that fact is stranger than fiction; certainly it is more 
wonderful. Chemistry affords the opportunity for a 
genuine and characteristic emotional experience. 
Its disciplinary values—In disciplinary values chem- 
istry is unsurpassed as from the first lesson it requires 
the highest kind of thinking. Its procedure is scien- 
tific from the beginning; its method is that of the re- 
search laboratory, which calls for the highest order 
of application and logical analysis. The pupil must 
learn to think or he gets nowhere. It therefore calls 
out all of the student’s potential ability. It also 
develops in him the qualities of thoroughness, per- 
severance, patience, accuracy. It inculcates the scien- 
tific attitude and fixes in the pupil the inductive habit 
of thought. ‘‘It necessitates at almost every step rea-
-P-A-G-E-302
  284 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
soning from things seen to things unseen, and from 
particular facts to general laws. It cultivates the 
scientific use of the imagination. It gives the student 
opportunity to apply his knowledge of mathematics, 
English and drawing. It gives him skill in the use 
of apparatus and fits him for further similar work 
later. It develops accuracy, self-dependence, and in- 
tellectual honesty. It furnishes him an insight into 
—nay, more, it even introduces him personally to the 
methods that have been and that are used in the study 
of nature and natural laws. It encourages his innate 
desire to ask questions and teaches that lesson which 
it took the human race many centuries to learn—that 
the questions must be asked, not of men, nor of books, 
but of the things themselves.’’ 
The Teaching Objectives 
The objectives of the course in high school chem- 
istry may be shown in outline as follows: 
I. Knowledge. 
1. A general view of chemical science—its 
primary laws and theories. 
2. A body of practical information with ref- 
erence to the composition of substances 
commonplace in the lives of the pupils, and 
the chemical changes occurring in famil- 
iar household and industrial processes, 
leading up to a comprehension of the in- 
dustrial application of chemical science. 
3. An insight into the logical procedures in 
chemical research.
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 285 
4. The history of the science of chemistry, 
especially the history of the discovery of 
the primary facts and laws. 
II. Skills developed. 
1. Laboratory manipulation. 
2. The art of inductive thinking. 
III. Emotional experience. 
1. Appreciation of the wonders of the physi- 
cal world. 
2. Enthusiasm for the subject. 
Obviously it is impossible in a high school course 
to cover the entire subject, or, because of the imma- 
turity of students, to go into quantitative analysis 
and the more technical developments of the subject 
profitably. If chemistry is taught as a ‘‘memory’’ 
study by the ‘‘textbook method,’’ it will have little 
value. It is inherently a laboratory study, and its 
method is the highest form of inductive thinking de- 
manded of the pupil. This means that the study can- 
not be taken up profitably below the junior or senior 
years. Not more than two years’ work should be un- 
dertaken. The effort should, therefore, be directed 
toward giving the pupil, first of all, a group of those 
facts and theories which are alphabetic in chemical 
science—the primary facts, principles and theories. 
It is recommended that the effort be confined to a 
smaller scope of study with greater stress upon the 
quality of the pupil’s work. Whatever is undertaken 
should be mastered perfectly. 
One of the principal objects of science study is to 
give the pupil an acquaintance with his physical en-
-P-A-G-E-304
286 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
vironment, and the ability to interpret its phenomena. 
One of the important functions of high school chem- 
istry is to give the pupil an understanding of the 
composition of those substances which he constantly 
uses, and of the chemical properties and processes in- 
volved in his domestic and industrial environment. 
Therefore, a considerable portion of the time granted 
to the subject should be devoted to the composition of 
water, air, soils, rocks, sugar, salt, goods, fertilizers, 
paints, patent medicines, preservatives, insecticides, 
disinfectants, etc., and to the chemical processes in- 
volved in dairying, removing stains, antidotes for 
poisons, the reduction of ores, the production of steel, 
the refining of oil, sanitation, the production of gas, 
the refinement of sugar, the manufacture of dyes, 
starch, gas, paper, leather, rubber goods, lime, cement, 
soap and extracts, and the chemical changes which 
take place in the physiological processes of the body. 
Student must understand method of research—It is 
necessary that the student of chemistry acquire a 
clear conception of the several methods of research. 
It is impossible for him to make any headway un- 
less he does so. The several methods of Difference 
and Agreement, of Concomitant Variation, and of 
Residues, ‘he will need to employ on different occa- 
sions, and unless he understands the logic of such proc- 
esses his experimentation will lack a definiteness and 
certainty which it is sure to possess if he is able to 
proceed from step to step with a consciousness of 
the procedure as a whole. 
The discussion of the relation of the history of phys- 
ics, in connection with the study of that subject, ap- 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 287 
plies equally to the teaching of chemistry. The de- 
velopment of the subject fact by fact, and theory by 
theory, from its beginnings in the ancient gropings of 
alchemy forms a most interesting and inspiring story. 
It makes the student at home with the subject. He 
feels as though he had grown up with it. 
The attention of the teacher should be given to the 
development of two skills: the manipulation of ap- 
paratus, and the use of the inductive process. The 
pupil stands in need of training for both. Much of 
the blundering, the waste of time, the confusion, and 
the breakage, might be obviated by a few lessons de- 
voted exclusively to manipulation and care of ap- 
paratus and materials. There is even greater need of 
eareful supervision of the thinking process of pu- 
pils. They will need training in proper sequence: 
observation, hypothesis and verification. And in each 
of these steps in the inductive process they will need 
guidance until they are safely independent. 
As indicated in a preceding paragraph the variety 
of study which is here outlined under the hand of a 
live teacher, possessing insight into the infinite re- 
lationships of the world of matter, should give the 
pupil two emotional experiences. He should feel a 
lively appreciation of the wonders which God has 
wrought in the nature of things. The world should 
be to him a myriad of miracles, the mystery increas- 
ing with acquaintance. It should become sacred to 
him, speaking in unmistakable language of the power 
and workmanship of the Creator. At the same time, 
the student should develop an ardent enthusiasm for 
the subject. Its fascination should fill him with a
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
passion for research. These attitudes toward the 
subject may prove to be the most profitable results of 
the course. 
The Teaching Process 
As in physics the teaching process comprises the 
following steps: Observation, Hypothesis, Verifica- 
tion, History, and Application. 
Chemistry should follow the inductive process—This 
is the inductive process. The lesson properly begins 
in the laboratory rather than in the lecture-room. 
The first step is the production by the teacher of a 
fact which stimulates the desire for an explanation. 
The observation of the fact, together with all of the 
conditions present, is followed by the question as to 
the cause of the situation, which constitutes the prob- 
lem to be solved. The pupils are led by suggestion 
and questioning to propose possible explanations. 
These are the hypotheses advanced as a basis of in- 
vestigation. The class should, at first, take the sev- 
eral hypotheses one at a time and discuss the possible 
methods of verification. Having determined upon the 
one which appears most feasible, they will proceed 
to set up and perform the experiment. The results 
should be discussed to discover the reasons for the 
success or failure of the experiment. In like man- 
ner, the several hypotheses should be disposed of until 
all suggestions have been exhausted. This should 
be conducted in the beginning of the course as a class 
exercise, members of the class proposing hypotheses, 
and handling the experiment. The teacher should be
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 289 
the guide. His primary objective will be to train the 
pupils in scientific procedure. After all members of 
the class have grasped the method of research, they 
may work in groups, each group undertaking the veri- 
fication of a single hypothesis, and reporting results 
with discussion of its experiment to the class as a 
whole. 
The experimentation: should be followed by the 
study of that portion of the text bearing upon the 
question under discussion, and by any lecture-material 
which the instructor has to present. In connection 
with the presentation of the textual and lecture- 
material, the history of the discovery of the fact would 
properly be given. The historical data may be pre- 
sented by the instructor, or be secured by the pupils 
from the reference books to which they should have 
access. 
The last step in the teaching process is the applica- 
tion of the newly acquired information to the explana- 
tion of the chemical facts and processes of practical 
interest which involve the principles that have been 
under investigation. 
Such a lesson, beginning with the careful obser- 
vation of selected facts, and following in order the 
formulation of hypotheses, their verification first by 
experiment and then by authority, the history of the 
discovery of the fact, and its utility in the industrial 
and domestic life of the pupils, affords a magnificent 
discipline in initiative, logical thinking, cultural con- 
templation and practical application. It is a disci- 
pline which surpasses anything else offered in the 
curriculum. 
 
-P-A-G-E-308

290 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
It may be helpful to call attention again to the place 
given to the lecture, textbook, quiz, and laboratory 
exercise in the above lesson plan. The teacher must 
bear in mind that chemistry in its very nature is a 
laboratory subject, and must be pursued inductively. 
This means that the laboratory exercise for the most 
part is not a demonstration or practice-exercise to 
illustrate facts and principles learned from the text- 
book or lecture, but an exercise in which the pupil is 
endeavoring to discover the truth for himself. Con- 
siderable information must be given dogmatically as 
a matter of expediency, but it should be the constant 
ambition of the teacher to do as little dogmatic teach- 
ing as possible. His ambition should be to make the 
laboratory exercise a truly research exercise. The 
lecture and textbook study should follow, not precede 
the laboratory exercise, and with the purpose of sup- 
plementing and further verifying the conclusions 
which the pupil has drawn from his experimentation. 
The place of the quiz is at the end of the lesson 
and later at intervals, for the purpose of reviewing 
and fixing the acquired information accurately and 
firmly in mind. 
A very good example of this method of procedure 
is taken from De Garmo’s ‘‘The Studies of the 
Secondary School’’: ‘‘A concrete problem taken 
from elementary chemistry wil] suffice to show the 
kind of mental activity involved in chemical experi- 
mentation. Suppose the problem is to find the cause 
of the formation of the ash-like substance seen upon 
the surface of base metals when they are heated. 
‘“‘The first thing to do is to heat the metal or metals
-P-A-G-E-309
THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 291 
in an open retort, when observation quickly shows 
the ‘ash.’ It will conduce not a little to the student’s 
interest to learn that many centuries had to pass be- 
fore man learned the true cause. An explanation of 
scientific method (observation, hypothesis, and veri- 
fication) will prepare for the solution of this problem, 
and show the worth of exact and complete, and the 
worthlessness of inexact and incomplete observation. 
Since a knowledge of the truth can be adequately 
obtained only through the student’s own thought, he 
is asked to propose a hypothesis as to the cause of 
this ash-forming seen on heated metals. Of course 
it will occur to him that the heat is a cause, but he 
will suspect that it is not the only one. It will easily 
occur to him that the air is present, and may perhaps 
be excluded. The teacher may suggest that it be dis- 
placed by hydrogen, which for the present is to be 
considered merely as a means for excluding the air. 
If now, the heated metal remains untarnished in a 
stream of hydrogen, and the student is convinced that 
the air has something to do with the corroding of the 
metal, it is certain that this conviction will be con- 
firmed and strengthened when he sees that with the 
return of the air the familiar color reappears on the 
heated metal. Even if it now seems to be proved that 
without the presence of the air the metal cannot 
change, that therefore the air exerts a direct influ- 
ence in the change, yet the nature of this influence is 
still unknown. Further experiments (lessening of 
the column of air and changes in it caused by contact 
with the hot metal and increase in weight of the lat- 
ter) lead the student through similar metal processes
-P-A-G-E-310
  292 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to be certain that the so-called ‘ashes’ on the hot 
metals are nothing more than combinations of the lat- 
ter with that part of the air which, without knowing 
what it is, one may say with confidence is the part 
that is most active in the burning of combustible 
bodies. The production of oxygen out of oxide of 
mercury, which immediately follows, brings this se- 
ries of experiments to a close. Here follows naturally 
a glimpse over the history of this discovery: Knowl- 
edge of the ancients about ‘ashes’ later called ‘lime’ 
as well as the erroneous views of the nature of metals 
and their ‘ashes’ during the middle ages and later 
times, from Geber (800) to Stahl (1697) ; the complete 
overlooking of the influence of air and the consequent 
erroneous view that the cause of the corrosion lay in 
the metals themselves, and that consequently they 
might be changed to precious metals (the efforts to 
change base metals into gold lasted for 1,500 years) ; 
the proposal of the phlogiston theory, which, though 
recognizing the ‘calcifying’ influence of the air, fell 
into another error by failing properly to observe the 
change of weight in the latter and the final elimina- 
tion of this error by Lavoisier.’’ 
The teacher should not be too greatly discouraged 
by the meagerness of his laboratory equipment. The 
discussion of the physics laboratory will apply equally 
well to chemistry. A full equipment will expedite 
experimentation in a way; and yet there are certain 
disciplinary and cultural advantages derived from the 
necessity of calling out the ingenuity of pupils. Many 
of the great discoveries in chemical science were made
-P-A-G-E-311
  
THE TEACHING OF CHEMISTRY 293 
in laboratories which would appear extremely barren 
of equipment to the modern teacher. 
The reader is also referred to the discussion of the 
place of the laboratory notebook in the chapter on phy- 
ises. The observations in that connection have the 
same value in this. 
Summary 
Chemistry is inherently a laboratory study, and 
for this reason affords a variety of training not to be 
secured from any other subject. Like physics it is 
rich in educational values. 
The teaching objectives are: (1) knowledge of gen- 
eral chemical science, practical information with ref- 
erence to the chemistry of familiar things and proc- 
esses, an insight into the method of chemical research, 
and the history of the science of chemistry; (2) skill 
in laboratory manipulation and the art of inductive 
thinking; (3) appreciation of the wonders of the phy- 
sical world and enthusiasm for the subject. 
The teaching process involves the following steps 
in order: observation, hypothesis, verification, his- 
tory, application. The inductive method is employed. 
The same conditions as to pupil-initiative, group- 
experimentation, careful generalization, and accuracy 
of record required in physics, will apply in chemistry. 
Greater emphasis than ordinarily is given should 
be devoted to the chemical interpretation of the pu- 
pils’ environment. A considerable proportion of the 
allotted time should be given to the composition of
-P-A-G-E-312
  294 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
water, air, soils, rocks, sugar, salt, paints, preserva- 
tives, ete., and to the chemical processes involved in 
dairying, reduction of ores, removal of stains, etc., 
together with the chemical changes which take place in 
the human body. 
The teacher should strive to arouse a real enthusi- 
asm for the subject. Much should be made of the 
emotional experiences possible in chemistry.

CHAPTER XV 
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 
The biological sciences constitute the second divi- 
sion of the natural sciences, and include the follow- 
ing special subjects: General Biology, Botany, Zo- 
ology, Physiology and Hygiene, Embryology, Histol- 
ogy, Anatomy, Economie Botany, Heonomic Zodl- 
ogy, ete. 
In addition, several of these subjects are further 
specialized. The biological sciences differ from the 
exact sciences of physics, chemistry and mathematics, 
with reference to both subject matter and method. 
Biology is not an exact science, for the reason that it 
deals with the most incalculable factor which man has 
undertaken to investigate, namely, Life. Biology is 
the science of the phenomena of propagation, nutri- 
tion, growth, organic function, development of species, 
adaptation to environment—the various phenomena 
which, constitute the functional aspects of the un- 
knowable thing we call life. These phenomena may 
be observed, catalogued, classified; type structures 
and processes noted; uniformities formulated; and 
still at every point the student meets the impossibility 
of making definite distinctions, and of predicting pos- 
itively the processes which will ensue from any given 
set of conditions. The laws of physics and chemistry 
may be stated with apodictic certainty; there is no 
295
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
variableness, and therefore no need of exceptions or 
reservations. But the laws of biology admit of no 
such assurance. Variation is the rule rather than 
the exception. The ‘‘laws’’ of habit, instinct, hered- 
ity, generation of species, adaption to environment, 
are not more than tendencies—‘‘central tendencies’’ 
they might well be called—from which variations in 
all directions must be recognized. It is a rule of 
surgery to expect a given structure to conform to the 
location and form described in the books in about forty 
per cent of the cases. In six cases out of ten it will 
be more or less out of position or will vary more or 
less from the type form. There is always this fringe 
of variants surrounding the phenomena which con- 
form to the ‘‘central tendency,’’ the performances of 
which can not be calculated. We are all familiar with 
the adage: ‘‘One man’s meat is another man’s poi- 
son.’? The physician does not venture to predict the 
reaction of a particular stomach to a particular rem- 
edy. All of his cases are ‘‘individual.’? The ‘‘in- 
dividual case’’ is characteristic of biological science. 
No ‘‘two black-eyed peas’’ ever were exactly alike or 
behaved in exactly the same way. 
Besides the element of capriciousness which makes 
the organic world so incalculable, there is also an ele- 
ment of mystery in all living things which makes the 
world a great wonderland. As wonderful as are the mar- 
vels of mechanical phenomena, they fall far short of 
the wonders of Life itself in its mysterious nature and 
its marvelous manifestations of energy and resource. 
Biology portrays to the student the world’s eternal, 
incomprehensible and ever-changing romance. He
-P-A-G-E-315
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 297 
finds himself revealed in a thousand forms and tricks 
of life about him. Through the creatures of earth 
and water and air he comes into vital touch with the 
Creator. The world of living things is to him a great 
mirror which reflects back to him the dual mysteries 
of human experience, man’s own nature and the na- 
ture of God. 
“‘To him who in the love of Nature holds 
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks 
A various language.”’ 
The phenomena of reproduction, growth, nutrition, 
generation of species, and organic functions—the es- 
sential factors in the world of living things and, there- 
fore, in the life of man, are confined to the field of 
biology. Another element of subject matter peculiar 
to biological study is the inter-relations of creatures: 
of animal and plant life, of certain plant forms and 
certain other plant forms, of certain animals and other 
animal types on which they depend. These inter- 
dependencies are most significant. Besides, there are 
the correlative adaptations: the adaptations of living 
organisms to physical environment, and of structures 
and functions in a given organism, to balance up prop- 
erly some new modification of structure or function. 
Such studies result in insights into functional rela- 
tions, the chapter which brings the student nearest to 
an understanding of the mystery of life. 
Of the phenomena of life, birth, growth, death, ad- 
justment, the physicist and chemist know nothing. 
These facts and relations are entirely outside the prov- 
ince of the exact sciences. Obviously, the biologi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
298 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
cal sciences are essential to an understanding of the 
world in which we live and to an understanding of 
ourselves as living in the world. They become, then, 
very important in the course of study. The curricu- 
lum which omitted biology would be grievously im- 
perfect and inadequate. There can be no acceptable 
substitutions for biological science in the system of 
instruction. 
The study of biology begins in the field—The method 
employed in biological science in its general and ele- 
mentary aspects is the simplest form of induction. 
Induction per Enumerationem, involving (1) first of 
all, observation of individual cases in their natural 
relationships and engaged in their normal functions. 
This observation should be extensive and accurate, 
should be sufficiently extensive to give the pupil a 
real working knowledge of his field, and sufficiently 
accurate to discover and report the facts. The good 
teacher will insist upon both requirements: that the 
student secure a wealth of data by first-hand acquaint- 
ance, and that he train himself to the point of relia- 
bility in observation and report. The success of 
biology teaching is determined at this point. Fail- 
ure is due most commonly to the acquisition of an 
inadequate factual basis for generalization, with the 
result that the generalizations lack real meaning and 
validity. There are three or four principles of teach- 
ing which should be noted in this connection. First, 
biological study is properly a ‘field study, not a lab- 
oratory subject, particularly in its elementary phases. 
The place to begin is in the outdoors. The study of 
botany should begin in the meadows and woodlands
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 299 
and along the highways. Its first step is to get a 
personal acquaintance with the plants of the region 
in which the pupil lives—their structural characteris- 
ties; their habitat; their plant, animal and human as- 
sociations; their adaptations to their environments; 
their food; their enemies; their economic uses and 
esthetic quality—and to get this personal acquaint- 
ance by companionship with them where they are 
rooted and at work on their job. The proper begin- 
nings of zodlogy are similar. The real zodlogist be- 
gan as a companion of birds and insects and other 
creatures. He collected and followed and looked and 
listened. He gathered a vast fund of knowledge of 
individual cases. He learned how this and that and 
the other creature lives—what it eats, how it fights, 
what it fears, how it hides, how it has fun, where it 
lives, how long it lives, its family life, its associations. 
If a pupil can be led to acquire a wealth of such in- 
formation, he will possess an adequate basis for trust- 
worthy generalization. The first principle is that the 
study of biology must begin in the field, and should 
very largely remain there, and that it should be ex- 
tensive. 
Creatures must be studied in their relationships—A 
second principle is that creatures, both plant and ani- 
mal, should be studied in their relationships. No 
animal lives unto himself. In a very real sense, its 
situation is a part of its life. In other words the re- 
lationships of a creature to its environment are a 
part of it as a living thing and must be included in 
a study of it. Not only structural characteristics and 
protective features are understood in connection with 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
300 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the environment to which it is adjusted, but its or- 
ganic functions are similarly determined. The squir- 
rel in the cage is not the real squirrel; he is less than 
the clever, active, and wonderfully-equipped citizen 
of the oak tree. Much less does the dead specimen or 
the stuffed skin tell the truth about squirrels. Ob- 
servation should be directed to the creature in action, 
and to its relationships to the situation of which it 
is a part. 
Biological study requires time—A third principle is 
that observation of the type described above requires 
time. It requires, in fact, that the young naturalist 
shall extend his field work over several years and 
through all seasons. Biology differs in this particu- 
lar from all other science studies. A rather complete 
study may be made of elementary physics in the school 
year, and without regard to season. But not so in 
biology. Educators are coming to see that the bio- 
logical instruction of the schools should extend 
through several consecutive years of the elementary 
and high schools under the direction of one person, 
the best years perhaps being from about the fourth 
to the tenth school years, and if possible the direction 
should apply especially to the summer months. With 
four or five years of carefully and enthusiastically 
directed field work in the elementary school as a basis 
for high school instruction, it would be possible to de- 
vote the allotted time in the latter to organization of 
material, to generalization of field experience, and to 
the investigation of special problems of structure and 
function. 
Emphasis should be placed on how creatures live—A 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 301 
fourth principle is involved in all of the foregoing; 
namely, that the emphasis in teaching biology should 
be placed on how the creature lives, or on its vital 
activities, rather than upon structure and morphology. 
That is, problems such as structure and accommoda- 
tion should be interpreted through the ecological re- 
lations of the creature. This again emphasizes the 
relative importance of field work. The laboratory 
and the microscope should be the last resort of the 
teacher of biology. After the eye has exhausted its 
possibilities, the hand lens may properly be taken 
up, and not until the hand lens has been exhausted 
should the microscope be introduced. 
Accuracy of observation is required—The second re- 
quirement of the observational phase of biological 
study is accuracy: Accuracy in seeing the facts, and 
accuracy in telling what is seen. This is an art which 
all students must acquire. It is not inborn. It re- 
quires long and sedulous training to make the normal 
youth see and tell the ‘‘truth, the whole truth and 
nothing but the truth.’’ First of all, he must acquire 
the power of emptying his mind of all fancies and pre- 
conceptions. It is a trick of the eyes to seem to see 
what the memory has stored away from reading and 
kindergarten tales. The mind instinctively seeks to 
confirm its anticipations. It is also a trick of the 
eyes to seem to see one’s self in every other creature. 
The boy is a more or less rational person, and tends 
to let this characteristic color his observation. He is 
conscious of certain mental processes in connection 
with certain activities. He observes what he takes 
to be the same activities on the part of animals and
-P-A-G-E-320
302 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
naturally infers that the animal experiences the same 
mental processes which were involved, or which he 
thinks were involved, in his own experience. And so 
he tends to go about clothing the wild folk with his 
own mental life. Nature literature is filled with such 
fallacious observations of men who enjoy good repu- 
tations, but who are grossly deceived by the reflec- 
tions of themselves in the wild life they are trying to 
portray. It is no easy matter to relieve the mind of 
the biases of memory and of the personal equation, yet 
it is precisely this which the student of biology 
must accomplish or his studies will degenerate into the 
pursuit of fairies. That is, there can properly be no 
difference between the method of teaching elementary 
biology and the method of biological discovery. If 
biological instruction is not scientific in its spirit and 
method, it loses all reason for a place in the course of 
instruction. 
Danger of hasty inferences—The student must also 
learn to protect himself against the very natural 
tendency to accept the suggestions of his first view 
as the facts in the case. This is another trick of the 
mind which is the source of endless confusion and 
misinformation. He sees a particular movement on 
the part of an animal which suggests that certain 
other movements will follow. The temptation is 
strong to infer that such movements did occur, and 
to feel entirely certain that one really did see what he 
merely inferred. Inference necessarily is the large 
factor in observation; the problem is not to eliminate 
the element of inference, but to cultivate the habit of 
checking up these suggestions by following the crea- 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 303 
ture through all of its movements, or by repeating 
the observation on the same or other creatures many 
times on different occasions and under different cir- 
cumstances. The student should be trained to be 
critical toward his observations, unwilling to accept 
any conclusions as true until the accumulated evi- 
dence leaves no ground for reasonable doubt. 
Carelessness in reporting—Again, carelessness in 
reporting is a prolific source of error. The enthu- 
siasm of discovery and the instinct for ‘‘the finished 
story,’’ combine to sweep the young naturalist off his 
feet and make him unconsciously tell more than he 
saw, or shade his report to give an account which 
satisfies his desire for completeness. Much attention 
should be given to the proper training of the pupil in 
this respect. He should learn to exercise due restraint 
of his literary impulse, to be modest of statement, to 
“tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth.’’ It is entirely a matter of training, but one 
which will require painstaking practice. Imagination 
is an invaluable part of the naturalist’s equipment, 
and the great outdoors is full of the liveliest romance, 
but the youthful explorer must confine his imagination ; 
to the limits of ascertained truth, and he must learn 
that facts are more romantic than the creations of his 
own fancy. It is important also to habituate pupils 
to making copious notes in the field. Memory is a 
treacherous servant, and the student should early 
learn to be sceptical of its contents. The notebook 
should go with field-glass, camera and collecting-can. 
The first step in the inductive process employed in 
biological study, as indicated in the preceding para-
-P-A-G-E-322
  304 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
graphs, is in the painstaking observation of the larg- 
est possible number of individual cases. The second 
step is generalization; the organization of this mass 
of information into concepts of kinship, and of bio- 
logical conditions and processes. As already sug- 
gested, the problem is not so much to secure gener- 
alizations on the part of the student as it is to induce 
him to defer such step until a sufficient mass of ac- 
curately established data is available to warrant a con- 
clusion. 
Generalizations: systematic and functional—The gen- 
eralizations of biology are of two kinds: first, those 
relating to the identity or kinship of individuals, to 
their place in the animal or plant series; second, con- 
cepts of anatomical, morphological, ecological and 
economic relations, conditions and processes, etc., or 
what may be called the ‘‘principles of biology.’’? The 
first type of study has been called ‘‘Systematic,’’ the 
second, ‘‘Functional.’’ The former results in a class- 
ification of the animal and plant kingdoms; the latter 
in an organized view of life processes and condi- 
tions. 
Vl Two things should be said in this connection. 
Historically, the first type of generalization came first 
and for many years monopolized the thought of the 
student. Later, the second type appeared and at 
once displaced the former, but properly both types 
of study are necessary. The so-called ‘‘systematic 
studies’’ logically precede the ‘‘functional’’ studies. 
Not only do they require the organization; of one 
variety of observational material, and that the data
-P-A-G-E-323
  
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 305 
necessarily be first established, but they also supply 
the student with essential data for the second type of 
generalization. Both logically and psychologically 
the ‘‘systematic’’ concepts must precede the concepts 
of functions and cannot be omitted without fatal dam- 
age to the latter generalizations. 
Student should be trained in process of generaliza- 
tion—The second remark suggested at this point is 
that the student should be definitely trained in the 
process of generalization. The reader is referred to 
the discussion of this topic in an early chapter, and 
particularly to the illustrations of the processes of 
abstraction, analysis, and synthesis drawn from the 
field of biology. It is sufficient in the present con- 
nection to remind the teacher that the process of gen- 
eralization is itself a complex movement involving the 
steps of abstraction, comparison, judgment and verifi- 
cation, and to urge that the pupil be trained to follow 
the movement through systematically. It is as neces- 
sary to organize and properly assimilate data as to 
secure them in the first instance. Attention is again 
called to the suggestion that this second step be pre- 
sented to the pupil in the form of problems which re- 
quire the necessary classification of accumulated data, 
abstraction of particular features as bases of com- 
parisons, and the resultant findings, with the neces- 
sity, frequently, of further exploration afield or of 
experimentation in the laboratory and readings in the 
library. A careful restudy of that portion of Chapter 
III relating to the inductive process in instruction is 
recommended.

Educational Values of Biology 
Study of biology is rich in educational values. 
Reference to the comparative evaluations in Chapter 
II recalls the opinion stated there that no other study 
is richer in its possible contributions to the equipment 
of the youth for successful living. It is necessary 
as.a preparation for the study of agriculture, general 
and specialized. Scientific agriculture became pos- 
sible only with the development of biological science 
in its functional aspects. Nor can the teaching of 
agriculture as a scientific procedure be effectively ac- 
complished without a sure basis in sound biological 
training. And this is particularly true of the special- 
ized branches of agricultural science, among others 
horticulture, animal husbandry, forestry, breeding, 
seeding, improvement of stocks, animal and plant 
hygiene. 
Biology is the prerequisite for medicine. Modern 
medicine dates from the time when biology became 
well-established as to its essential principles, and is 
wholly unintelligible without instruction in the mother 
science. Back of the new surgery and science of med- 
icine is the work of Darwin, Huxley, Koch, Pasteur, 
and their associates and successors. So completely 
has medicine become grounded in biology that it is no 
longer possible to follow the instructions of the family 
physician intelligently without a knowledge of bio- 
logical fact unknown two generations ago. 
Psychology and its cognate subjects, likewise, are 
grounded in general biology, and the great victories
-P-A-G-E-325
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 307 
of modern science, sanitary engineering and public 
hygiene, also owe their existence to the facts and 
principles marshalled for use by the explorers of the 
organic world. Without going into detail, it is ev- 
ident that the student here comes into possession of 
the key which unlocks to him the meaning of the great 
advances of later civilization, a knowledge without 
which he will remain in outer darkness as to the im- 
portant things of our day and the next. 
The practical value of biology—There are also im- 
mediate practical contributions of biology to the work 
of the gardener, housekeeper, orchardist, farmer and 
stock-raiser. The knowledge of the conditions of 
plant growth, of seeding, fertilization, plant foods, 
light and moisture conditions, is of direct value to the 
gardener and florist. Knowledge of the life history 
of weeds and grasses, which compete with garden 
plants for soil, moisture and light; of the animal pests, 
which feed upon growing plants, is of immediate value. 
The orchardist finds equal profit in the same informa- 
tion, particularly in the life history of the parasite 
with which he must contend for his crops, and in the 
principles of grafting, pruning, budding, and cross- 
fertilization. To the housekeeper the lessons from 
botany and zodlogy are no less useful. The life- 
history of insect and rodent pests of the house and 
methods of exterminating them; the identity, life- 
history and methods of dealing with the many forms 
of bacterial life, both friendly and hostile, with which 
the housewife must concern herself; the biological 
aspects of preserving and preparing foods and of 
cleaning; there is in these applications, which the in-
-P-A-G-E-326
  308 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
telligent woman will make without further technical 
training, a vast deal of information of immense value. 
Much of the foregoing knowledge is also of immediate 
use to the farmer and stock-raiser. The ecological 
aspects of plant study offer direct and extensive ap- 
plication to the planning and cultivation of crops. 
The principles of nutrition and heredity are working 
rules of the stockman. These few illustrations will 
serve to show the great practical value of biology to 
all kinds of people and all kinds of activities. Cer- 
tainly no more useful subject is offered in the high 
school. It is worth while to call attention in pass- 
ing to the importance of emphasizing the practical 
applications of the knowledge acquired in biologi- 
cal study, for the reason that many teachers miser- 
ably fail at this point. Such emphasis will make 
the subject of unfailing interest to the student, and 
greatly enrich the educational service of the school. 
Teachers are being urged to relate all instruction more 
closely to the life of the learner, both his life as a 
youth and the life which awaits him as an adult. 
Biology, next to English possibly, offers the best con- 
ditions for doing this. To fail to do this would be 
inexcusable. 
Biology teaches the laws of health—The opportunity 
for teaching the laws of health by way of application 
of the facts of biology has been discussed in the preced- 
ing paragraphs. How this may be done will be ap- 
parent to the teacher at once, and it is sufficient to urge 
the importance of this opportunity. The duty of con- 
serving health is paramount to all other functions 
of the school, and it is a grievous betrayal of respon- 
hee
-P-A-G-E-327
  
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 309 
sibility to overlook any means of creating a sane pub- 
lic intelligence with regard to the laws of proper liv- 
ing. The responsibility of the biology teacher in this 
connection is very great, greater seemingly than that 
of any other teacher in the high school. 
Biology teaches the fundamental principles of ethics— 
Among the ‘‘instrumental’’ values of biology must be 
considered also the opportunity to impress upon the 
pupils the fundamental principles of ethics. This may 
be accomplished in two ways; through developing in- 
spiration for lofty living, and by direct applications 
of biological fact to clearing up certain delicate prob- 
lems of morality. The teacher has the opportunity in 
an unusual degree to glorify life, to create zest for a 
thoroughly adjusted and biologically successful life. 
A wonderful impetus is thus given for clean living. 
‘ Life may be made a thing so wonderful that it becomes 
sacred, and its imperfections a source of keen pain. 
Through an intimate acquaintance with nature the way 
leads straight up to nature’s God. The youth attuned 
to the beauty of the world about him, to its wonders, 
and to its spiritual content, is lifted to a level above 
the ugliness of dissipation and sin. The love of life 
is incompatible with immoral living. The principle in- 
volved is that youth is lifted to a level of living above 
the base and ugly by his appreciation of the glory of 
life developed, or which may be developed, through an 
intimate knowledge of its varied forms acquired as 
individual problems are worked out. The naturalist 
catches the spirit of the world of beauty and wonder 
into which he has been adopted. 
The second contribution to the ethical development 
   
-P-A-G-E-328
  310 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the student in the study of biology relates especially 
to the matters of sex and dissipation. It is generally 
agreed that the essential facts of human sex life may 
be presented incidentally in connection with the study 
of reproduction of plants and the lower animals with 
such clearness as to protect the pupil from the criminal 
misinformation with which the quack assails him, and 
with such dignity as to rob the whole subject of ugli- 
ness and prurient curiosity. The Hebrew prophets 
understood in their day what modern life is reinfore- 
ing, that the stability of an individual or a nation in 
every respect, ethically, physically, industrially, so- 
cially, depends upon chastity; and that chastity de- 
pends not upon the innocence of ignorance, but the 
wholesome-mindedness of a proper and dignified un- 
derstanding of the relation of sex to life in the large. 
The youth who is led to see sex processes as co- 
operative with the Creator in the perpetuation of life 
comes to think of them in a larger way and on a higher 
level, which powerfully reinforces his ideals and his 
will. Once he comes to see his sex functions in this 
higher and more significant light, he finds himself in 
possession of a self-mastery which is not so easily se- 
cured by mere self-abnegation. The second principle 
which may be given a definite ethical application is the 
almost universally prevailing freedom of nature from 
dissipation. The creatures of wood and field do not 
assault their physical machinery with unreasonable 
demands of all kinds. They avoid poisonous foods 
and drinks, they do not give themselves up to excesses 
of passion and appetite, they do not educate tastes for 
harmful foods and beverages, they do not waste them-
-P-A-G-E-329
  THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 311 
selves in the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige or 
pleasure. Birds and beasts were the first temperance 
society. They were the first association to promote 
sane living. The teacher of biology has at hand a 
wealth of data for sending home the great lesson of 
conservation. of physical energy. It may be argued 
with good reason that the teacher of this subject may 
accomplish more than any other teacher in the school 
or college in laying a proper foundation for a vital 
morality. 
The cultural values of biology—The cultural values 
of biology are almost as rich as those outlined in the 
preceding paragraphs. The emotional experiences 
which accompany the unfolding drama before the 
youthful explorer are among the most definite and 
abiding experiences of student life. It is debatable 
whether literature, even, is so rich in the sentiments 
stimulated day after day. First among these to be 
noted are the intellectual delights which are aroused 
as the intricacy, delicacy of adjustment, and the unex- 
pectedness of form, structure and function are re- 
vealed. The ever new marvels of adjustment, and the 
increasing inexplicableness are calculated to stimulate 
increasing interest and to give keener and keener de- 
lights. Much has already been said of the refinement 
of thought and feeling wrought in the pupil under the 
spell of the natural world. It is a fact of common 
knowledge that the naturalist is a poet. His life in 
a world of beauty inspires him with flights of poetic 
thought. In his effort to give proper expression to 
his insights and emotions he falls into symbolism and 
rhythm. The beauty of forest avd field awakens the
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
artist within the man. The liberalizing value of 
biology also must be rated high. The study of life 
relations and the myriad folk of nature lifts the in- 
dividual out of his narrower circle of thought and 
feeling and makes him a citizen of the world of living 
things. The fund of knowledge acquired affords a 
self-mastery, a mastery of environment and an intel- 
lectual independence which increases individuality, 
while at the same time raising the student above petty 
considerations and interests. The broadening in- 
fluence of a study which makes the pupil akin to the 
whole world and opens up to him the deepest problems 
of reality must be very great indeed. Biology is 
highly reconstructive in the sense that it offsets the 
effect of classical and physical studies. It may also, 
of course, bring about a reorganization of concepts of 
life and life relations formed in the nursery and from 
early teaching. The reconstructive tendency of bio- 
logical study in the life of the individual may be esti- 
mated from the changes which it has brought about in 
philosophical and religious thinking during the last 
half century. Biology now dominates the thought of 
the world. 
It is obvious that the instrumental and cultural 
values outlined thus far, particularly the cultural 
values, are conditioned by the method of teaching in 
vogue. If the subject is presented in the spirit of the 
foregoing discussion and with the object of accom- 
plishing the results potential in the subject, the val- 
ues given above will be largely, if not fully, realized. 
But if the subject is treated merely as a matter of 
learning a text or following out the directions of a
-P-A-G-E-331
  THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 313 
laboratory manual, failing to see the beauty and won- 
der of the wild life and the larger aspects, biology 
may be as barren of results as memorizing dates in 
history or logarithmic tables in mathematics. The 
‘disciplinary values’’ likewise depend upon the 
metho¢e of instruction. If the method is organized to 
secure certain disciplines as well as to awaken an abid- 
ing interest and acquire a fund of information, the 
educational worth of the study will be greatly en- 
hanced. Just as we found with reference to the sub- 
ject matter involved that no other study can properly 
be substituted for biology, so we will find that no other 
subject contains the elements of specific training 
which are involved in biological studies. The essen- 
tial nature of the training afforded in biology fur- 
nishes a second conclusive reason for including this 
subject in the high school curriculum. There are four 
of these disciplines. The first is the habituation of 
the pupil in scientific observation and simple induc- 
tion. The importance of this training is revealed 
when we reflect that this is the species of thinking 
which constitutes the larger part of the systematic 
thought-life of the adult. The second variety of train- 
ing, which is secured almost exclusively in the sys- 
tematic phases of botany and zodlogy, is in exact 
classification. To think is to classify. Judgment is 
classification. The art of classification which the pu- 
pil may develop in botany and zodlogy has large po- 
tential value in training him to be a thinker. The 
third discipline peculiar to biology is the use of the 
type-concept in thinking. In the exact sciences we 
employ the truly universal concept. The law of fall-  
-P-A-G-E-332
314 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing bodies applies equally to all cases. The value of 
‘«Pi’’ is everywhere and under all conditions the same, 
but the general concepts of biology do not have this 
universality, this invariableness. No two wild-rose 
plants will attain the same height, have exactly the 
same leaf-form and structure, the same color of pet- 
als. Variability from the normal is to be expected. 
The nearest approach which a biological statement can 
make is to say that the rose will be found ‘‘generally,”’ 
or ‘‘more frequently,’? to grow in such and such 
a place, between such and such heights, and to 
exhibit such and such other characteristics to approx- 
imately the same degree. The ‘‘central tendency,’’ 
or ‘‘most frequently occurring’’ is taken as the type 
or norm in thinking of the class, and as representa- 
tive of the class. This variety of concept is char- 
acteristic of all subjects dealing with living things, 
and facility in its use is of utmost value. Again, no 
other study can be accepted as a substitute for biol- 
ogy in this species of discipline. The fourth disci- 
pline is the habituation of the pupil in the use of the 
concept of functional relations. This is a type of idea 
which the student has not experienced in the other 
sciences as definitely as he must in biology. More 
and more he becomes accustomed to thinking of the 
creature as a something which behaves in such and 
such ways. Study of the creature resolves itself 
chiefly into a study of its modes of behavior. This 
habit of thinking in terms of behavior equips the pu- 
pil for many of the demands which he must experi- 
ence in adult life. It would be out of place in this 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 315 
chapter to dwell upon the significance of the four 
types of discipline which biology, properly taught, 
will contribute to the education of youth, and which no 
other subject will provide, at least in a manner so 
rich and definite. Suffice it to urge upon the teacher 
the duty of utilizing this very great opportunity of 
giving his pupils a training in methods of thinking 
which will be of inestimable worth to them through- 
out all life. 
To summarize this discussion, we have endeavored 
to call attention, very briefly, to the following educa- 
tional values latent in the subject of biology as a 
school subject, and realizable under proper methods 
of teaching: 
I. Instrumental. 
1. Preparatory to the science of agriculture, 
general and specialized. 
Preparatory to the science of medicine. 
Preparatory to psychology and cognate 
subjects. 
Preparatory to science of sanitation and 
public and private hygiene. 
2. Of immediate applicability by the gar- 
dener, farmer, stockman, orchardist, house- 
keeper, etc. 
3. Offers opportunity for laying the best 
foundation for ethics. 
4. Promotes public intelligence with refer- 
ence to laws of health. 
II. Cultural. 
1. Awakens the keenest intellectual delights, 
   
-P-A-G-E-334
  
  316 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
stimulates a deep emotional experience, 
reveals a world of entrancing beauty, 
arouses animating interests. 
2. Has high liberalizing value, giving the pu- 
pil the larger viewpoint for his thinking, 
making him a citizen of the world of living 
things, and giving a fund of information 
and insights which greatly free him from 
the prevailing limitations of life. 
8. Biology is highly reconstructive in the 
. mental and spiritual life of the pupil, off- 
setting the peculiar effects of classical and 
physical studies, and giving him the higher 
and larger viewpoint in which he himself 
occupies a less prominent place. 
III. Disciplinary. 
1. Habituating the pupil to scientifie observa- 
tion, to careful induction, to classification, 
to the use of the type-concept in thinking, 
and to the concept of functional relations. 
Teaching Objectives 
In discussing the teaching objectives in high school 
biology we need but to restate the values outlined in 
the preceding section as aims of teaching. First, 
what knowledge should the pupil be expected to ac- 
quire? Asa basis for other knowledge he must form 
an acquaintance with types of animals and plants. 
Some orders of life comprise a small enough number 
of individuals that the pupil may reasonably be ex- 
pected to know the characteristics, so as to identify
-P-A-G-E-335
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 317 
any creature belonging thereto at once as to species 
and so forth. In the larger orders this requirement 
is obviously too difficult, and here the pupil should 
become so familiar with family characteristics that he 
can at once associate any specimen with the family to 
which it belongs, and be able by means of keys to com- 
plete the identification in detail. If type-concepts are 
really mastered, the task of classification of individual 
cases is not only facilitated but made less mechanical. 
Identity is the first relation of the individual to be 
learned, and no pains should be spared to make the 
pupil skilful in the process of identification. Learn- 
ing the type-concepts, more than mere practice in 
identification, will give this skill. In addition to this 
knowledge, the pupil should have an intimate acquaint- 
ance with the fauna and flora of his own vicinity. 
The second variety of knowledge to be acquired is 
animal and plant ecology, the modes and conditions 
of behavior. The food supply of animals, how pro- 
cured, its seasonal variation, the creature’s adjust- 
ment to extremes of temperature, of water supply; 
its methods of protection from enemies; the foods 
which plants require, how they are procured, how 
taken into the plant body, how digested, how assimi- 
lated; such topics should receive very careful consid- 
eration. Special attention should be given to the proc- 
esses involved in nutrition, growth, reproduction, 
and the generation of new species and varieties. 
A third line of knowledge comprises the phenomena 
of interdependence of plants among themselves, and of 
plants and animals. Fourth, much should be made 
of the economic uses of the various animals and plants
-P-A-G-E-336
  318 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
studied. This is a phase of the subject which ap- 
peals strongly to students, especially to the boys, and 
will insure the practical values discussed above. 
Man’s clothing and shelter are for the most part pro- 
cured from the animal and plant world. Full and 
reliable information with reference to the sources of 
these utilities certainly is desirable. The last knowl- 
edge objective is the esthetic relations of the plants 
and animals studied. This phase of study has al- 
ready been sufficiently emphasized in the preceding 
sections. 
The second teaching objective is the stimulation of 
the emotional experience to which frequent reference 
has already been made; the feeling of wonder elicited 
by perception of the curious and often marvelous pro- 
visions of nature for the maintenance of life; the sense 
of the bigness, complexity, and close organization of 
the world; the sense of the joy in the world of wild 
things; the feeling of the presence of God in the world, 
caring for His creatures. The enthusiasm of discov- 
ery and exploration is, in itself, a most wholesome 
experience, making not only for the growth of per- 
sonality but also correcting to considerable extent the 
deadening influence of school routine. 
The third objective is the development of facility 
in accurate observation of individual cases, in abstrac- 
tion, comparison, and in generalization from individ- 
ual cases, in the classification of data, and the forma- 
tion of type and functional concepts. The nature and 
value of these skill-objectives have already been dis- 
cussed.

The Course of Study 
The content and sequence of the high school course 
in biology are so completely conditioned by local fac- 
tors that to undertake to present a type course of 
study is not advisable. Bearing in mind the func- 
tion of the high school to supplement the elementary 
school, it is obvious that the allotment of time in the 
former to any study, and particularly to a study like 
biology which should be extended over a long term of  
-P-A-G-E-338
    320 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
years, will depend considerably on the scope and 
quality of instruction in the earlier grades. Like- 
wise, in determining the division of time between bi- 
ology and other subjects, such as history and Hnglish 
in the high school, we must be governed largely by the 
extent and content of training in those subjects in 
the elementary grades. In view of these considera- 
tions, it is impossible to be specific with regard to the 
amount of time and scope of work which should be 
required in high school biology. 
. There would seem to be no need of argument in de- 
fence of the proposition that every high school pu- 
pil should have a minimum of a half year of physiol- 
ogy, hygiene and sanitation. It were better, and the 
practical values justify it, to have a full year for the 
course. There will be a difference of opinion, sup- 
ported by facts, as to the school year in which such 
course should be given. In view of its utility and 
also of the large loss of attendance in the earlier 
years of the high school, there is good reason for mak- 
ing it a first-year (9th-year) subject. On the other 
hand, its logical relations to other biological studies 
and to physics, chemistry and civics, are such that the 
course will be more easily presented, and richer in 
meaning for the pupil, if given in the fourth or senior 
year, and certainly not earlier than the third year. 
Again, the local administration will have to be gov- 
erned largely by the status of the pupils as they reach 
the high school, and the success of the school in hold- 
ing its pupils. The assumption will probably not be 
questioned that the more specialized branches of bi- 
ology, as histology, embryology, anatomy, and the
-P-A-G-E-339
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 321 
specialized branches of botany and zodlogy, are prop- 
erly college studies and have no place in the high 
school, regardless of the time available. 
This narrows our consideration to three studies, 
in addition to the course in physiology, hygiene and 
sanitation—botany, zodlogy and general biology. 
Properly, a year of work is the minimum acceptable 
for a high school science. Less than this time-unit 
does not give a sufficient working period to carry 
through lines of development, or to permit that matur- 
ing of insight which is after all the essential factor 
in the learning process. Only the most serious ex- 
igency should be regarded as a sufficient reason for 
reducing the minimum below the full school year. On 
the whole, it seems to be better to devote an entire 
school year to either botany or zodlogy, ignoring the 
other, than to divide the time between them. It is 
wholly inadvisable to undertake a course in general 
biology in less than a full school year. There has 
been a disposition in some quarters to substitute gen- 
eral biology for botany and zodlogy. There may be 
local conditions which favor this arrangement, but, 
on the whole, the writers prefer to devote the time 
of the high school pupil to the latter subjects, leav- 
ing the course in general biology to the college, rather 
than the obverse sequence. It seems to them vitally 
important that the pupil get acquainted with the crea- 
ures as such, and, if there is not sufficient time avail- 
able to cover the whole field in an approved manner, 
to supplement these ‘‘survey’’ studies by developing 
incidentally the major biological principles in the man- 
ner suggested in the first half of the chapter.
-P-A-G-E-340
  322 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Methods 
In general, the method of teaching biology in the 
school or college is the same as the method of biolog- 
ical research. It is the method of exploration, dis- 
covery and experiment. The psychological process, 
as set forth in the first part of the chapter, is the 
process of simple induction supplemented by experi- 
ment. The discussion of this process throughout the 
chapter and in Chapter III would seem to be ade- 
quate both for clearness and emphasis. 
It is in order to remind the teacher that biology is 
essentially a field study. The textbook ‘should serve 
rather as a manual for systematizing observation and 
experiment. Strictly speaking, the laboratory method 
as such should not be employed in the high school 
in connection with this study. In the college the bi- 
ological laboratory has its place, and the laboratory 
method furnishes the proper procedure. In the high 
~school the laboratory may be entirely disposed of 
without serious loss. Certainly microscopic studies, 
except to demonstrate the structure of tissues, or to 
exhibit now and then a minute type of life, should 
not be given the place of things more important for 
high school pupils. These observations are meant to 
imply, also, that the equipment of the high school 
biological laboratory should be very simple indeed. 
One or two compound microscopes, a few dissecting 
pans, a half-dozen sets of dissecting instruments, a 
large number of moderate-priced magnifying lenses, 
and collecting-nets and cans, should constitute the
-P-A-G-E-341
THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 323 
major equipment. An aquarium and some cages for 
insects and others for small animals should be in- 
cluded. One or two good cameras, a dark-room, and a 
half-dozen field glasses should take the place of the 
microscopes which this plan would omit. 
The investment of energy and funds in a highly- 
equipped biological laboratory is more profitably de- 
voted to building up a department library. Equally 
with history and English, the department of biology 
needs a large and well-chosen reference library. 
This library should contain, in addition to works rec- 
ognized as authoritative in the several fields of biology, 
a vast deal of material of a popular but trustworthy 
character which will serve to supplement the observa- 
tion of the pupils, convey additional information, sug- 
gest new lines of investigation, arouse fresh enthusi- 
asm, and reveal insights which ordinarily would not 
occur to the average youth. Representative of this 
class of material are the writings of John Burroughs, 
the popular articles of David Starr Jordan and Theo- 
dore Roosevelt, Roosevelt’s ‘‘Wild Animals I have 
Known,’’ and the vast collection of nature stories of 
high grade in the better-class magazines. There 
should be included an extensive collection of pictures, 
prints and photographs, which may be collected 
through the National Geographic Magazine, Under- 
wood and Underwood, and similar agencies. The 
biology library also should contain the splendid series 
of bulletins relating to animal and plant life pub- 
lished by the Bureau of Agriculture at Washington, 
and the cognate publications of other bureaus of the 
Department of the Interior.
-P-A-G-E-342
  324 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Summary 
The biological sciences are essential to an under- 
standing of the world in which we live, and to an un- 
derstanding of ourselves as living in the world. They 
deal with a class of phenomena not presented in any 
other study, and involve methods and limitations of 
thought not met with by the student in any other sub- 
ject. The curriculum which omitted biology would 
be grievously imperfect and inadequate. 
The study of biology properly begins in the field, 
rather than in the laboratory, with observation of 
plants and animals in their natural habitat rather 
than with the microscope. 
Plants and animals, also, must be studied in their 
relationships, not merely as individuals. Emphasis 
should be placed on how the creature lives. 
Biological study requires time; in fact, that the 
young naturalist shall extend his field work over sev- 
eral years and through all seasons of the year. Brief 
courses in physics and chemistry may accomplish 
worth-while results; not so in biology. 
The instructor must bear in mind that the validity 
of induction depends upon accuracy of observation, an 
art not easily acquired. It requires long and sedulous 
training to make the normal youth see and tell ‘‘the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.’’ 
The pupil must be trained also to avoid hasty in- 
ference. 
Biological science involves two types of investiga-
-P-A-G-E-343
  THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY 325 
tion, the one relating to the identity and kinship of 
individuals, and the other to the anatomical, morpho- 
logical and ecological relations. Logically, the so- 
called ‘‘systematic studies’? precede the ‘‘functional 
studies.’ Both should be included in the course of 
study.

CHAPTER XVI 
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 
Physical Geography is the representative in the 
high school of the group of studies known in our 
classification as the ‘‘earth sciences.’’ It is not so 
much a science as it is a combination ,of the ele- 
mentary facts and principles of a number of sciences. 
Strangely enough, while it is impossible to fix the 
lines of demarcation of this subject, it is by conven- 
tion the best defined as to subject matter of the sci- 
ence studies of the high school course. 
Physical Geography, or Physiography, as it is 
sometimes styled, comprises four general divisions. 
The first is concerned with the astronomical facts and 
relations involved in the place of the earth in the 
solar system, and serves the double purpose of giv- 
ing the student a proper point of view for the other 
topics in the course, and also of forming an introduc- 
tion to the science of astronomy. The second divi- 
sion treats of the facts and processes which are at 
work in the shaping of the earth’s crust and its at- 
mospheric envelope. The third division is historical 
and descriptive, presenting a view of the physio- 
graphic features of the earth’s surface resulting from 
the operation of the forces described in the second 
division. The fourth division deals with the distri- 
bution of plant, animal and human life as determined 
327

  328 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
by the forces and features portrayed in the second and 
third divisions. 
Educational Values 
The educational values of physical geography de- 
pend upon the character of the instruction. The sub- 
ject may be presented in such manner as to give it 
very great value, or it may be presented in such me- 
chanical and nonvital fashion as to yield to the pupil 
no perceptible increase of knowledge, personality or 
discipline. It is rich in possibilities in the hands of a 
teacher who combines large scholarship in the other 
sciences and especially in geology, and who has had 
also proper scientific training. It has large possible 
values as an introduction to the sciences of astronomy 
and geology, and should be taught with the object of 
giving pupils enough insight into the scope and nature 
of these two fields to awaken the desire for more 
knowledge. Those phases of the subject which por- 
tray the processes involved in soil-formation, erosion, 
inland water supply and weather phenomena, lead 
directly into the science of agriculture. 
Physical geography may prepare the student for 
more intelligent work in economic geography. The 
admirable little book by Semple, ‘‘American History 
and its Geographic conditions,’’? and its companion 
volume, show that it is indispensable as a preparation 
for the study of history both industrial and political. 
It has been said that nations, like armies, ‘‘travel on 
their bellies.”’ In the last analysis, food, clothing, 
fuel and building materials are determined as to loca-
-P-A-G-E-347
  PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 329 
tion and availability by physiographic agencies. Two 
factors combine to produce the stream of human his- 
tory, the personal and the physiographic, the per- 
sonality of the human stock and the physiographic 
forces, with which or against which man contends. 
It is evident from this fact that the student who 
would understand human history, economic, political, 
and social movements, must study them in the light 
of the factors and conditions presented in the physi- 
cal geography of the region involved. Obviously, the 
botanical and zoélogical history of any region also 
is conditioned in like manner. This means that the 
course in physical geography, even as it may be taught 
in the high school, may have very great value as a 
preparation for subsequent and more advanced study 
of natural sciences and of history and the social sci- 
ences. 
The practical availability of the subject is obvious. 
The farmer profits directly from his knowledge of soil 
formation, irrigation, drainage, water supply and 
weather phenomena. The last variety of informa- 
tion is of general utility. To the statesman, who must 
be able to predict the spread of population and the 
rate and direction of economic development, and to 
the industrial promoter, the practical utility is far 
greater. 
The cultural values are not so obvious. This sub- 
ject, like all others, offers the opportunity to awaken 
zeal for scholarship, and with the increase of knowl- 
edge and understanding here presented, as of other 
varieties of knowledge, there comes growth of per- 
sonal force and self-mastery. The study of the phe- 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  330 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
nomena of water and volcanic action may open to the 
student a view of wonderful proportions, stimulating 
his emotions to poetic heights. Properly taught, 
physical geography should give a very definite emo- 
tional experience. 
The variety of discipline which the pupil receives 
in this study depends altogether upon the methods of 
instruction employed. There are at least three disci- 
plines possible: the acquisition of the ‘‘survey’’ 
method of investigation, facility in the use of the type- 
concept in thinking, and practice in deductive reason- 
ing in the application of geographical principles in 
working out the problems presented in new situations.

tion of the earth, and of the enormous

4, In the use of the survey method. 
In the making and interpretation of the 
several kinds of maps. 
In the measurement of weather data, and 
the prediction of weather conditions. 
In deductive thinking as employed in work- 
ing out geographical problems. 
The ground-work of physical geography—It is evi- 
dent that the ground-work of physical geography con- 
sists in the acquisition of clearly-defined and adequate 
concepts of what have been called the ‘‘geographic 
elements,’’ that is, of the forces of air, water, heat 
and light, which working together on the materials
-P-A-G-E-351
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 333 
of the earth’s crust, have made it as the pupil finds 
it. These forces operate in well-defined ways known 
as geographic processes, which are governed by cer- 
tain laws and principles. A knowledge of these facts 
enables the pupil to think out for himself the prob- 
lems which are constantly presented to his attention, 
and to discover the interpretation of the facts of his 
environment. A knowledge of such facts as water 
and wind action, climatic processes, the phenomena 
of the earth’s cooling, is alphabetic in geographical 
thinking. Such concepts are fundamental. They be- 
come the tools of investigation and of interpretation 
of geographic features. Clearly they should be 
thoroughly mastered. 
Following the acquisition of this body of ‘‘ working 
concepts’’ are the study of the existing topographic, 
climatic, and other physical features of the earth, and 
the study of the distribution of plant and animal life 
resulting from or conditioned by these physical fea- 
tures. It is sufficient if the pupil comes to an under- 
standing of these facts only in general, for the world 
as a whole, but in getting this general view of the 
earth, it is materially helpful to organize the informa- 
tion by regions. The geographic features of the 
United States, as one of these regions, and of Canada 
as another region, or as part of the United States 
region, should be learned in considerably greater de- 
tail. The state or section of the United States in 
which the pupil lives should be mastered in full detail 
and as concretely as possible. If the pupil is to be 
helped to a full and adequate knowledge of his own 
section of country, he must procure much of the pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  334 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ceding knowledge in general, and will acquire the ap- 
perceptive material which enables him to understand 
the rest of the world far more clearly. Great empha- 
sis should be placed upon these local studies. The in- 
struction in this division of the subject should be given 
with the greatest care, for the reason that the subse- 
quent study of economic, commercial, political and so- 
cial geography must depend wholly upon the adequacy 
and vividness of the concepts which the pupil acquires 
in the first and second lines of work. 
In view of the nature of its content and the illumina- 
tion of human history which it affords, the fourth 
knowledge objective should appeal most strongly to 
teacher and pupil. Strangely enough it is the phase 
of the subject most commonly omitted. Physical ge- 
ography comes to its fruitage in the light it throws on 
the facts of industrial and political history, in fact all 
history. Professor Dryer recommends, in view of the 
importance of this division of the subject, that it re- 
ceive one-half of the time allotted to the course. 
Physical geography serves as an introduction to other 
sciences—Of the feeling objectives indicated, the 
second and third are of special importance. Physi- 
cal geography is not so much a science as an introduc- 
tion to several sciences, the most conspicuous of which 
are astronomy and geology. The former is of such 
great cultural value, and the latter of so much prac- 
tical utility, that all students should, if at all possible, 
be induced to take courses in both sciences of sufficient 
extent to insure real scholarship in both. Develop- 
ing an enthusiastic appreciation of the wonders of the 
Heavens, ‘‘the handiwork’’ of the Almighty, and the
-P-A-G-E-353
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 335 
tremendous geological forces at work, together with 
the more prominent facts of historical geology, will 
create a lively interest which will carry the student 
ontomore advanced studies. Possibly the teacher does 
the pupil no greater service than in thus planting and 
cultivating interests which become the dynamic of 
his later years. The subject also offers a splen- 
did opportunity for stimulating the feeling of wonder, 
a sense of bigness of the world, and the spirit of 
humility, through opening up to the pupil a view of 
the enormous forces at work carving out hills and 
valleys, rounding off the mountains, building plains, 
giving the home of man both beauty and availability 
of resource; or for giving a conception of the great 
periods of time employed; and together with these, 
the modest silence of these gigantic forees—through 
thus introducing the pupil to God at work creating the 
world we live in. 
The survey method—Much has already been said in 
the foregoing paragraphs with reference to the use 
of the ‘‘survey method.’? The method is not at all 
new, but has been given new significance in recent 
years by its employment in new fields of inquiry. 
As a mode of investigation it possesses certain ad- 
vantages which insure its permanence. It will, there- 
fore, be of real service to the pupil, whether he ends 
his education with graduation from the high school 
or goes on to higher schools, to give him such skill 
in this method of work as will enable him to interpret 
properly the findings of surveys, and to engage effi- 
ciently in such investigations himself. If this subject 
is taught, as is urged by such authorities as Professor
-P-A-G-E-354
336 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Salisbury and Professor Dryer, affording the student 
practice in exhaustive surveys in designated fields, it 
will be the means of giving considerable skill of this 
variety. The method of attack thus developed may 
prove, as a by-product, to be one of the prominent val- 
ues derived from the study. 
The use of maps—The best teachers of physical 
geography place great stress on training the student 
in the making and use of maps, and rightly so. There i 
are two reasons for this. First, the map is the lan- 
guage of record in geography, and obviously must be 
mastered in order to make the rich content of map- 
material available to the student. Second, the pupil 
will be expected to record his surveys in the form of 
maps and charts, and for this additional reason must 
acquire facility in the use of map-language. 
Lastly, a word should be said, by way of emphasis, 
of the value of training pupils to determine and record 
data from which the weather may be predicted, and 
to make weather forecasts. No one thing is of more 
concern to more people than the weather, and no 
ability is of more practical worth and satisfaction 
than the ability to interpret weather records and facts 
in relation to local conditions and interests. This 
variety of training also has considerable value in 
developing the scientific attitude of mind. 
The Course of Study 
The minimum time allotment to physical geography 
which will permit a reasonable survey of the whole 
subject is one year. It is not possible to cover the
-P-A-G-E-355

whole field in less time. To undertake to do so will 
require the sacrifice of the quality of instruction or the 
omission of parts of the subject. Two years may very 
well be given to the study as presented in the better 
textbooks. The relations of the subject to other 
sciences, and the general character of its content, make 
it possible if not advisable to place the course in the 
earlier years of the high school. ‘‘Physical geog- 
raphy is classed as a fundamental or basal science. 
It may be taught either in the early years of the high 
school or in the later years. From the nature of the 
first statement it can readily be inferred that a posi- 
tion in the freshman or sophomore years of work is 
vastly preferable. It furnishes a study of the phys- 
ical environment of plants and animals and contains 
so few principles of chemistry and physics that can 
not be taught in the freshman year that both groups 
of science argue ‘for the early position in the 
course.’’ ? 
The sequence of topics should be substantially that 
indicated in the first section of this chapter. The 
sequence of treatment exhibited in Dryer’s ‘‘High 
School Geography, ‘Complete,’ a quite popular text- 
book, is recommended as satisfactory, theoretically 
and in practice. 
Equipment 
Physical geography, properly, is a field study. 
There is a certain amount of experimental work in 
connection with weather phenomena, but this may as

well be done in the physics laboratory and save dupli- 
cation of apparatus. The department of geography 
should have a laboratory outfitted with the necessary 
globes, facilities for sand and clay modeling, and a 
complete equipment of relief-maps, wall-maps, and 
sheets. It is also essential that the classes have 
access to a well-stocked reference library. Lists of 
maps and reference-material are suggested at the end 
of the chapter. 
Methods of Teaching 
Let us quote again from Bulletin 35 of the Indiana 
Department of Public Instruction: ‘‘Whether phys- 
ical geography is a science or not is a point which 
has been much debated. It is also a point which is 
scarcely worth debating. The essential fact with 
reference to it is as to whether it is taught scien- 
tifically or not. The nature of every science demands 
that it be taught from the laboratory standpoint. 
Likewise, the nature of every subject demands a scien- 
tific treatment. So in the following outline it will be 
continually urged that the work be taught from the 
laboratory and field standpoint. If it cannot be so 
taught, it is decidedly questionable as to whether it 
is worth while to teach it at all.’’ ‘‘Of all subjects 
that may be treated from the standpoint of field and 
observation work, none lends itself more readily to 
such treatment throughout the school year than does 
physical geography.’’ These quotations state very 
clearly the point of view to be taken by the teacher. 
He is to employ a combination of the laboratory and
-P-A-G-E-357
  PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 339 
the field methods of teaching. Above all, he is not 
to treat the subject as a ‘‘text-book study’’ to be 
crammed at so many pages a day. 
In order that the lesson shall work toward the objec- 
tives stated above, the following procedure is sug- 
gested for the class exercise: 
1. Survey a given territory, fact or group of facts, 
selected as a type involving the general fact or prin- 
ciple, the concept of which is to be developed, and as- 
certain all of the facts, features and conditions 
observable. 
2. Formulate the problem or problems which the 
existence of the situation raises. 
3. Find the solution of this problem or the problems 
by further exploration, appropriate experimentation, 
and reference reading, developing therefrom the con- 
cept of the principle to be learned. 
4. Apply this principle of general truth in further 
surveys, reports and class discussions. 
To illustrate, suppose the aim of the lesson is to 
present the fact of glacial action in a class in one of 
the North Central states. We will also suppose that 
near the school is a field well covered with boulders, 
relics of glacial drift. The class will be expected to 
inspect this field, noting the character of the stones, 
their composition, their structure, shape, color, sur- 
face and any other characteristics, and will be led to 
develop the following questions, or questions similar 
to them: 
Are these stones native to the locality, or foreign? 
How do you explain their shape? 
‘What kind of rock are they? 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
340 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Where may the same sort of stone be found in 
masses which seem not to have been disturbed? 
How did these stones get here? 
To answer these questions, the pupils have recourse 
to their textbook, their reference books, the personal 
experiences of the members of the class, and the sug- 
gestions of teacher and friends. In class discussion 
these questions will be raised and answered. Addi- 
tional information with reference to the topic will be 
introduced. All ideas submitted will be checked up 
and organized into a working concept of glacial action. 
This concept will now be employed in further study 
of glacial history and of glacial action now in opera- 
tion in different parts of the earth. The mental proc- 
ess involved in this method of class-exercise com- 
prises: 
1. The study of a particular situation involving the 
fact or principle to be taught. 
2. Development, out of the facts involved in this 
particular situation, of a problem in the solution or ex- 
planation of which the concept to be taught is evolved. 
3. This concept will have a concreteness for the 
mind of the pupil which makes it a part of his per- 
sonal experience, and thus provides the ‘‘working 
concept’’ or necessary apperceptive basis for further 
study of the group of facts or principles under 
consideration. 
Summary 
Physical geography is general ‘‘earth science,’’ 
comprising elements of astronomy, geographic evolu- 
tion, physiography and geographic biology. 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 341 
The educational values of the subject depend quite 
largely upon the method of teaching employed. The 
survey method is advised as giving better under- 
standing of subject matter and valuable scientific 
training. 
The teaching objectives should include, in addition 
to the knowledge to be acquired, an interest in the 
specialized sciences for which physical geography is 
preparatory and a sense of the mighty forces at work 
in the universe of which the pupil is a part. Partic- 
ular skills to be developed include the survey method, 
the making and interpretation of maps, weather- 
forecasting, and deductive thinking as employed in 
the solution of geographical problems. 
The minimum time allotment for effective work is 
one year. The major portion of the time should be 
given to field work.

CHAPTER XVII 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
Vocational training is limited in the high school at 
present to the commercial arts, the industrial arts, 
agriculture and home economics. The commercial 
arts include: Commercial Arithmetic, Commercial 
Geography, Bookkeeping, Shorthand, Stenotypy, 
Typewriting, Office Training, Commercial Law. 
The industrial arts include: Carpentry, Cabinet- 
Making, Sheet-Metal Work, Forging, Electrical Con- 
struction, Auto-Mechanics, Pattern-Making, Foundry, 
Machine-Shop Work, Printing. 
The work in agriculture is confined to the general 
elementary aspects of the vocation, including espe- 
cially soils and crops, animal husbandry, dairying, 
poultry and fruit-growing. The course in home eco- 
nomics is directed to the end of making efficient and 
thrifty housekeepers. A fifth line of vocational train- 
ing is developed’ in the department of art in some 
schools, and includes a variety of applications of 
art: Printing Designs, Illustration, Advertising Art, 
Cartooning, Landscape Gardening, Window Trim- 
ming, House Decoration, Metal Work, Textile Design, 
ete. The last-named will be omitted from this dis- 
cussion because of doubt as to efficient handling in the 
ordinary high school. These subjects occupy middle 
ground between the vocations of admitted secondary 
343

    344 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
grade and the professions, business and engineering 
which require more maturity of mind and a larger 
educational foundation, and for this reason are as- 
signed to schools of college and university grade. 
Object of vocational education, need of caution— 
The object of vocational training, primarily, is to fit 
the individual for remunerative employment. This 
is wholly worthy on the part of both pupil and the 
school. <A healthy society is grounded in the ability 
of each adult member to pull at least his own load. 
A proper education will provide for such training of 
the youth either in home, school, or in industry, as 
will fit him to make a living, and something more. 
The individual who has not been thus trained is so- 
cially defective. While this is true, however, and 
while the present-day encouragement of vocational ed- 
ucation is entirely praiseworthy, the subject must be 
approached with a word of caution, and always the 
vocational training of the individual must be ration- 
ally articulated with the other aspects and interests 
or life no less vital. 
Human life seven-sided—The high school must 
remember at all times that the pupil is a seven-sided 
creature, that his life is seven-fold, and that he needs 
definite training for each of these phases of his life. 
It is well to review these seven aspects of normal 
human life at this point in our discussion. First of 
all, is the biological life. Whatever else man is or 
may do, he has a physical life which must be success- 
fully lived, or everything else will be shipwrecked. 
His physical powers are the tools with which he works 
at everything else. They must be in the best of con-
-P-A-G-E-363
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 345 
dition if he does good work. He must also be hus- 
band and father, and sustain himself well in these 
relations, or society thus far commits suicide. On 
this side, education means making the best and most 
efficient physical man of the individual, and the best 
husband and father. Second, the individual must se- 
cure a living, and his nature calls for the satisfaction 
of his instinct of ownership. He must live the 
economic life, and successfully, if he and his family 
and his country are to survive. He is so constituted 
that he must acquire property. Third, he must live 
an intellectual life in some measure. His curiosity 
must be satisfied in some direction, and, the more 
fully and definitely it leads him to seek satisfaction 
of the instinct for knowledge in vitally significant 
truth, the more abundant will be his life and that 
of those to whom he contributes. Practical necessity 
reinforces instinct in this demand for the intellectual 
life. Fourth, he lives the civic life on some level of 
social efficiency. He must in the nature of things be 
some kind of a citizen. He must count for some de- 
gree of social justice or injustice. Manifestly he 
should be trained to count for the best. Fifth, he is 
a social being. He has a well-pronounced instinct 
for fellowship. Companions of some sort he must 
have. The greatest punishment to which he can be 
subjected is solitary confinement. Robinson Crusoe 
found the hermit life intolerable. Man must be iden- 
tified with a group in which he finds stimulation, sym- 
pathy and the enjoyment of kind. Sixth, he must have 
a pleasure-life in which the whole range of wants 
from the desire for simple sports up to hunger for
-P-A-G-E-364
  346 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the highest things of art are clamoring for satisfac- 
tion. His soul must have sunshine. Seventh, man 
is a religious person. His religious nature may be 
intermittently active, but there is in him a more or 
less conscious sense of his relationship with God, and 
the effort to make this relationship harmonious. 
Man is seven-sided. He is living seven lives in one, 
or, he is living a seven-ply life. He is at once and all 
the time, a Family man, a Pleasure man, a Society 
man, an Economic man, a Civic man, an Educational 
man, and a Religious man. He may shirk any one or 
more of these lives, but he cannot altogether escape 
them, and the consequences are inevitable. He may 
live any one or more of them on a low level of effi- 
ciency, but it will be at the expense of himself and also 
of his generation. A proper education must raise 
him to the highest level in each of these relationships. 
Nor does the principle of division of labor apply here. 
Specialization is safe only after the individual has 
secured those general attainments which make him an 
efficient person in each of his seven relationships. 
Any specialization before this attainment is reached 
results in the production of a social defective, the bur- 
den of whom to society is likely to more than offset 
the value of his specialized service. 
Tendency to overestimate the economic factor in 
life—The reason for reminding teachers of this larger 
function of education is the current tendency to over- 
estimate the economic factor in life. Making a living 
is essential, but it is only one of seven essentials. 
The man himself is always more important than his 
job, or than what he eats and wears. The whole is 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 347 
bigger than its part. Much of educational discussion 
to-day overlooks this exceedingly simple but vital fact. 
Training in a vocation is one of the co-ordinate parts 
of a rational education, but it is not more than this. 
The pupil should not be pigeon-holed—In planning 
vocational courses care should be exercised that the 
pupil is not ‘‘pigeon-holed’’ in a level of employment 
below that of which he is capable. This warning 
applies particularly to commercial departments and 
‘‘business schools,’? where thousands of really ca- 
pable youths are chained to small jobs for life. It 
is a serious wrong to shut a boy away from larger 
activities for which he is by nature fitted, a wrong to 
the boy and to society. Society needs to have each 
individual at work on his highest possible level. Our 
country, in fact the whole world, is now suffering from 
a famine of workers on the upper levels. Not because 
there are not enough individuals with the native en- 
dowments required, but because the shortsightedness 
of youth, parents, and school authorities has shunted 
so many capable young men and women into ‘‘blind 
alleys.’? A course in commercial training may be 
the worst thing possible for the high school boy. It 
certainly is, if it means hiding him away in a small 
office job. 
Closing the door to advancement undemocratic—This 
warning also attaches to certain recent legislation 
relating to admission to vocational schools. In some 
cases these regulations require that pupils and par- 
ents specifically obligate themselves that the pupil 
shall not pursue his education beyond the completion 
of the vocational course. This policy deserves the
-P-A-G-E-366
348 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
severest condemnation, as utterly wrong in principle 
and in practice. It is undemocratic, and un-American. 
It closes the doors to possible advancement instead 
of opening up continuous pathways. Back of the 
policy is the un-American doctrine of caste education 
borrowed from a nation whose education, as well as 
whose political philosophy, has recently received the 
just condemnation of mankind. But it fails in prac- 
tice also. It is as important vocationally for the in- 
dividual to get out of the life-work for which he is not 
natively adapted as it is to train him in the calling he 
has chosen. A primary function of vocational educa- 
tion is to help the boy find his proper place as a 
worker. The business of the teacher of mechanics is 
first of all to discover, and help the boy to discover, 
whether the pupil has those native capacities which 
will enable him to become an efficient mechanic, and 
whether the school might be spoiling a much-needed 
and valuable worker in the higher ranks of activity by 
binding this youth to the machine shop. If the teacher 
does not perform this service, he is certain to fill up 
the ranks of workers with misfits, and the ultimate 
outcome may be worse than if the school had kept out 
of the field. The ministrations of the vocational 
school should be devoted to those individuals who by 
native endowment are most sure of making the best out 
of life for themselves, and for society in the fields of 
work for which the school offers training. The school 
should keep constantly in mind its function to sift out 
types of workers and to help each to get into the pro- 
per employment. Above all, there should be no closed 
doors in education except to the unfit.
-P-A-G-E-367
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 349 
Misconception of the economic process—A serious 
oversight in the current vocational program grows out 
of the fallacious conception that the economic problem 
is a matter of increased production. Particularly 
during the war was this idea emphasized. We ob- 
served the strange paradox of heroic effort to increase 
production of materials of all sorts, combined with 
the most abandoned orgy of spending in the history 
of the world. We face the curious situation of half 
of the world in starvation while the rest has an un- 
paralleled surplus of all materials. America’s 
economic problem is not so much one of increasing 
production as of efficient distribution and equitable 
exchange, together with a sane economy in the use 
of materials. We are lamentably weak in our system 
of marketing our produce, and our extravagance in 
the face of the want in our own land as well as abroad 
is acrime. Many teachers of home economics are re- 
vising their courses in order to provide for training 
their pupils to work over clothing, and to utilize all 
left-overs in cooking. They are giving definite train- 
ing in purchasing clothing materials and food supplies. 
This departure is most commendable. It is in the 
direction of the species of training which our times 
demand, and should become the universal practice of 
the schools. The same situation is found in agricul- 
ture. Farmers are more successful in producing 
crops and livestock than they are in profitable market- 
ing. The heaviest tax paid by the American farmer 
is the waste of unmarketed produce which the con- 
sumer needs. Farm accounting, insurance, finance, 
marketing, and purchasing of supplies, are in greater
-P-A-G-E-368
350 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
need of emphasis by the schools than methods of in- 
creasing production. 
Two Types of Vocational Training 
The first type—Psychologically, there are two types 
of vocational training, distinguished by the character 
of the learning process and the species of ability de- 
veloped. The first is that looking to securing an 
immediate specialized efficiency, in which the ‘‘con- 
trol’’ consists of habits induced by imitation of the 
master workman. This is the type of training em- 
ployed in the home to educate girls in housework. 
The daughters learn to cook, sew, and care for the 
house by imitating the mother. If the mother is a 
“good cook’’ or ‘‘neat housekeeper,’’ the girls of the 
family will be expected to exhibit the same excellence 
of housecraft. There is no thought of the principles of 
physics, chemistry, and biology involved in the cook- 
ing processes. A certain pastry is wanted. It is 
known that a certain recipe always obtains the de- 
sired result. This satisfies the novice; no one cares 
how or why the recipe ‘‘works.’’ New recipes are 
‘‘borrowed’’ or copied from others, not thought out. 
Another illustration may be observed in the educa- 
tion of the boys on the farm. Ordinarily, the boy is 
“‘shown how’’ to do this and that and the other task, 
and held to rigid imitation. Any initiative on the 
part of the boy is rather certain to receive instant 
condemnation. Immediate results are wanted. The 
farmer wants no experimenting on his farm. He is 
satisfied with the accomplishments of himself and his
-P-A-G-E-369
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION F 351 
father, and feels that their methods are good enough 
for his sons. So, custom controls in matters of crop 
programs, of soil-culture, cultivation of crops, of seed- 
ing and harvesting, and of handling stock. The young 
farmer knows how the several activities of the farm 
are carried on in his family, or on their ‘‘place,’’ and 
he does them rather well, but he does not know why, 
nor does he know with any certainty whether the 
methods employed are obtaining satisfactory results 
from the investment. He is learning by slavish imita- 
tion, and if the persistence of the implement salesman 
and the agricutural agent, together with rivalry with 
the neighbors, did not inject a new feature into the 
farm program now and again, the methods would go 
on from generation to generation without improve- 
ment, as may be observed in the backward agricultural 
districts. 
Instances of the first type—The apprenticeship 
method of teaching trades is another instance of the 
first type of training. The young apprentice attaches 
himself to a skilled workman as helper and ‘‘to learn 
the trade.’’ He is expected to ‘‘catch on’’ as rapidly 
as possible to the methods and devices of the master: 
which tools to use in a given situation, how to hold 
them, what movements to make. The candidate in 
carpentry is told to observe the skilled carpenter, and 
note which saw he uses for a given cut, for a given 
kind of wood, how he holds the saw, and what move- 
ments he makes in the act of sawing. Having ob- 
served these operations, he is directed to imitate them 
faithfully until ‘‘he can do them as well as the mas- 
ter carpenter.’’ This variety of training will be 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
352 THE TEACHING OF HIGIL SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
found in many, if not the majority, of manual train- 
ing laboratories, and in the prevailing methods of 
commercial departments of high schools and in the 
business colleges. These are apprenticeship schools; 
the teacher is the master workman, and the students 
are apprentices endeavoring to acquire his skill by the 
process of imitation and simple habit formation. The 
object in view is fitting the worker in the shortest time 
to do a specific thing in a specific way—immediate 
specialized efficiency. The learning process is ‘‘de- 
liberate imitation’? under supervision, and with little 
or no concern for the system of principles involved in 
the activity. 
The second type—The second type of technical edu- 
cation is that which looks to a larger mastery of the 
vocation in which the ‘‘control’’ consists in the mas- 
tery of the ‘‘theory,’’ and in which a generalized 
rather than a specialized efficiency is sought. The 
reader will observe, at once, certain essential differ- 
ences between this variety of training and that de- 
scribed above. First, the objective is the learning of 
the trade or occupation in its larger aspects: its intel- 
lectual as well as its skill aspects; its social as well 
as personal. The aim is to understand as well as to 
do, to understand in order to do; to learn the body 
of facts and principles involved, and to develop skill 
in doing by application of this knowledge and in- 
sight. In the first type of training, skill is acquired 
by imitation of operations without question as to the 
reason for them; in the second type, skill is acquired 
by rational application of ascertained facts and laws, 
followed by practice for facility. The first copies
-P-A-G-E-371
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 353 
the art; the second thinks it out by analysis and syn- 
thesis. Again, in the second type of training, there 
is not the same demand for immediate results. The 
learner is willing to take more time because of his 
expectation of larger abilities and rewards in the end. 
The third difference is in the nature of the ‘‘control’’ 
of motor processes. In the species of training first 
described, the control is a memory image of the model 
operation; in the second, it is a general concept. The 
former is derived from memory of how the master 
executed the movement; the latter is a concept of the 
movement derived from a consideration of the facts 
in the case; the former is on the perceptual level, the 
latter is on the higher level of reason. 
In the second type of vocational education, the boy 
is trained for farming by causing him, as the approach 
to vocational mastery, to acquire a knowledge of the 
different soils, their constituent elements, how pro- 
cured, the normal proportions, the physical conditions 
necessary to plant growth, the best tools to employ in 
securing the desired physical condition of the soil. 
Having this body of data in mind, the boy is then 
taken to the field and set a series of problems, as: 
Is this ground physically and chemically adapted to 
the growth of a crop of wheat? If not, what treat- 
ment is necessary to put it into proper condition for 
a profitable crop? What does the ground need in 
preparation for corn? For the other staple crops? 
Outline a five-year crop program which you advise 
for this particular ground on the basis of the facts 
which you discover. Such problems lead the pupil to 
investigate the essential facts. In such exploration
-P-A-G-E-372
  354 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
he may need to pause and acquire methods of testing 
conditions. Through analysis and synthesis of the 
elements of the situation, the boy thinks out a solution, 
which, if followed by proper demonstration exercises, 
will check up his theory and also develop skill of ex- 
ecution. The boy learns how to farm intelligently 
and at the same time develops his personality. These 
two phases of growth combine to produce a farm 
manager, a vocation on a higher level than is pro- 
duced by the apprenticeship method. 
The same procedure is observed in the better grade 
of home economics instruction. The pupils first make 
a survey of food materials and their several values, 
individual and comparative, together with a study of 
the nutrition of the body in general and under condi- 
tions brought about by various employments. With 
these data in hand they then proceed to the planning 
of menus. Their courses in physics and chemistry 
of foods and cookery acquaint them with the physical 
and chemical changes produced in the processes of 
cooking, and with the nutritive values involved. On 
the basis of these insights, the pupils think out recipes, 
equipment, and so forth. Having mastered the the- 
ory of cookery, in the presentation of which they will 
have had considerable demonstration work, they may 
then take up laboratory practice for the purpose of at- 
taining skill in manipulation. Even if the girl fails 
to become a skilled cook, her study will fit her to be 
an intelligent supervisor of a home. 
In carpentry the method is similar. The first task 
is the study of such matters as materials, mechanical
-P-A-G-E-373
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 355 
principles employed in construction, the use and care 
of various tools, and efficient handling. After this 
grounding in theory the boy then works for skill, the 
‘control’? being the system of working concepts de- 
veloped in the theoretical study, as distinguished from 
the imitation of the model performance of the master 
carpenter in the apprenticeship method of learning 
the trade. It is obvious that the mastery of the car- 
penter’s trade by the rational method, if the indi- 
vidual possess reasonable ability for leadership, will 
produce the foreman rather than merely the skilled 
workman. 
Types of Technical Schools 
Pedagogically there are three kinds of vocational 
schools or departments: first, those which give the 
first or apprenticeship type of vocational training; 
second, those schools which give the second or rational 
type of instruction and training; third, those schools 
and departments which seek to combine the two types 
of training. Of the first kind, the ordinary ‘‘busi- 
ness college’? is a very good example. Most manual 
training departments are also of this variety. The 
polytechnic schools belong rather to the second group. 
Here and there are schools which maintain a work- 
ing relationship with local industries in which the pu- 
pil spends half of his time as an apprentice, the other 
half being devoted to learning the ‘‘theory’’ in the 
classroom and laboratory at school. Such an insti- 
tution is an example of the third type.
-P-A-G-E-374
  356 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The Learning Process 
The method of instruction and training employed in 
vocational subjects is determined by the nature of the 
learning process involved in the subject as modified by 
the objective. In the first type of training, in which 
immediate specialized efficiency is the objective, the 
learning process is simply a systematized imitation 
of a standardized performance. The control is a sys- 
tem of habits acquired by faithful imitation. The 
steps in the method of teaching are as follows: 
(1) Statement of the thing to be done. 
(2) Observation of the model performance. 
(3) Supervised practice of this model performance 
until the standard degree of efficiency has been 
reached. 
In the second or rational type of training, in which 
the object is the larger mastery of the vocation, with 
special reference to foremanship, the learning process 
is more scientific. It consists in the formation of a 
body of concepts by analysis and synthesis of con- 
crete situations and the application of natural laws, 
followed by demonstration of the adequacy of these 
concepts, and by practice for skill, controlled by the 
theory which the pupil has formed. The steps in the 
method employed in subjects presented in this manner 
are: 
(1) Statement of the problem. 
(2) Analysis of problem to determine the kinds

and amount of data required for the solution. 
(8) Acquiring an organization of data into prin- 
ciples. 
(4) Factoring of present situation for elements. 
(5) Abstraction of elements and comparison of 
each with principles previously developed. 
(6) Formation of working concept, that is, concept 
of the process or processes to be employed. 
(7) Demonstration. 
(8) Supervised practice for skill. 
Educational Values 
In general, the educational values of vocational 
subjects which involve the first type of training are 
inconsiderable, aside from their immediate utility and 
certain disciplines in the quality of workmanship. 
The subjects which involve or employ the second type 
of training have larger and more varied values. 
Commercial subjects, as ordinarily presented in the 
high school, are of the first type, and, hence, offer no 
values beyond their specific utilities, and habits of 
neatness, accuracy, orderliness, promptness, speed and 
self-control, which habits may or may not be formed, 
depending altogether upon the efficiency of the school. 
Manual training, when presented as of the first type, 
may be disposed of with the same observation. This 
judgment may also be recorded with reference to the 
other vocational subjects—agriculture, home econom- 
ics and industrial arts—if taught on the apprentice- 
ship plan. If taught by the ‘‘rational’’ method, how- 
ever, they have many and considerable values which  
-P-A-G-E-376
358 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
give them a reasonable parity with other high school 
studies. They have a large preparatory and intro- 
ductory value, considerable social and moral value, 
but possibly less of immediate utility, although this 
inferiority is not necessary. They certainly have 
. quite high cultural values, and exceptionally high dis- 
ciplinary values. It is not extravagant to say that, in 
the hands of a scholarly and pedagogically efficient 
teacher, the industrial arts, agriculture and home eco- 
nomics may be made as rich in values as the natural 
and social sciences. 
Summary 
The place of vocational training in the high school 
is secure. In the planning of study programs, how- 
ever, care must be exercised to avoid a number of pos- 
sible errors: (1) the error of overestimating the eco- 
nomic factor in life, to the neglect of the proper train- 
ing of pupils for the other relationships and fune- 
tions of life; (2) over-specialization resulting in 
‘‘pigeon-holing’”’ the individual; (3) closing the door 
to subsequent advancement to higher thought-levels; 
(4) a misconception of the economic process. 
There are two types of vocational training, dis- 
tinguished by the character of the learning process 
employed and the variety of ability developed: (1) the 
training looking to immediate specialized efficiency in 
which the control consists of habits formed by imita- 
tion of the master workman, (2) the training which 
seeks a larger generalized efficiency in which the con- 
trol consists in the mastery of the ‘‘theory.’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 359 
In the first type of training, skill is acquired by 
imitation; in the second type, skill is acquired by ra- 
tional application of ascertained facts and laws. 
There are three kinds of vocational schools: (1) 
those which give the apprenticeship type of training, 
of which the ordinary ‘‘business college’’ is a good ex- 
ample; (2) those which give the rational type of train- 
ing, of which the polytechnic and the manual train- 
ing department are examples; (3) those schools which 
seem to combine the two types of training. 
The educational values of vocational training, other 
than immediate utility, are almost entirely confined 
to the work of schools of the second and third types.

CHAPTER XVIIT 
THE TRAINING OF ASTHETIC JUDGMENT 
Three objectives in art education—The teaching of 
the fine arts may be addressed to any one of three 
objectives. It may seek to give a mastery of the tech- 
nique, an understanding of the theory of the art, and 
facility in the handling of the elements of composition. 
This variety of instruction and training produces the 
technician. Or, the objective may be the develop- 
ment of the composer and producer, the artist who 
creates or reproduces. In the third place, the aim 
may be to develop the power of appreciation, includ- 
ing esthetic judgment. The result of the first species 
of art-teaching is the science of art and art proc- 
esses; of the second, the creative and interpretative 
artist; of the third, appreciative ability and culti- 
vated taste. To a certain extent each variety of abil- 
ity involves the other two, but the correlation is not 
necessary, nor very generally present. The person 
who has attained a high degree of technical ability 
may as likely as not possess a low degree of taste. The 
creative artist may be wholly lacking in esthetic judg- 
ment, and it is possible to train the individual to a 
high degree of esthetic judgment and enjoyment with- 
out giving him an extensive training in the technique 
of art, or skill in execution. 
Appreciation of chief importance—While the high 
361 :

school should provide for all three varieties of art 
training, the third, appreciation, is of chief impor- 
tance. Hnough of the theory of music, graphic rep- 
resentation, architecture, and so forth should be given 
to every high school student to make him reasonably 
intelligent with reference to these matters as they 
oceur in everyday life. There is a body of fact in- 
volved in art which is commonplace in the thought and 
conversation of intelligent people, and which should 
be included in the education of the individual, purely 
as a matter of preparing him for ready adjustment to 
his social environment. Enough practice in execu- 
tion should be given to enable the individual to master 
the forms of the arts as means of expression. Line 
and color constitute a language which the individual 
will find necessary for the proper expression of his 
thought in the ordinary activities of the average man. 
Singing is so general a mode of expression that the 
man who does not sing must stand mute in many of 
the most vital situations in his life. The ‘‘language’’ 
of the arts has a practical utility for every life which 
can not well be lost. Enough of training is demanded 
to give the individual possession of these supple- 
mental languages. 
The majority should be trained for art consumption— 
But the great majority of persons are consumers 
of art rather than producers. That is, they are 
employed in selecting house-plans; choosing wall- 
coverings, draperies, rugs, furniture; choosing the 
colors for painting the house, planting flowers and 
shrubbery, laying out walks; selecting clothing ma- 
terials; choosing modes of entertainment—doing hun-

dreds of things each day involving the exercise of 
zsthetic judgment. The American people expend bil- 
lions of dollars annually on beauty, or in the pursuit 
of the beautiful. These billions are wagered on the 
esthetic judgment of the average man and woman. 
With the vast majority the venture is a matter of trial 
and error. Women purchase elaborate toilets which 
looked well on others, only to find that ‘‘the style 
does not suit’’ the purchaser. The outfit disappoints, 
offends, and is cast aside to make way for another 
wager. The literary, musical and dramatic worlds 
are mostly ruled by vogue rather than merit for the 
reason that the average man is not able to judge of 
these matters for himself with any assurance of ac- 
curacy. He, therefore, follows the judgment of those 
who look as though they ought to know. The masses 
of the people are governed in their activities and re- 
lationships which involve the fine arts wholly by mob- 
mindedness. Their test of merit is, ‘‘Everybody is 
reading it,’’ or ‘‘Everybody wears it,’’ ‘‘Hverybody 
goes,’’ or ‘‘All the fine people go to hear it.’’ Surely 
the public high school can render no greater service 
than to give to the youth of America that training 
which will make the next generation as accurate in 
its esthetic judgment, and as independent, as this 
generation is in motor mechanics and trading. We 
have alluded to the national economic aspect of the 
vast expenditures of our people for various forms 
of art, the wisdom of which is dependent upon the 
adequacy of the esthetic judgment. It is also true 
that the largest expenditures are for the least ar- 
tistic things. The gorgeous and gaudy articles are
-P-A-G-E-382
364 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
more costly than the really valuable ones. One needs 
but to give a look at the houses and gowns and play- 
things of the new-rich. There is no greater economic 
waste than the fortunes paid for the ugly and common 
and low, in the name of literature, drama, architec- 
ture, dress, polite intercourse and music. 
Vulgarity and morals—We have also, elsewhere, 
called attention to the fact that it is the pleasure life 
of the people which, more than any other one factor, 
determines their moral character. Nothing is more 
debasing than vulgarity—vulgarity in architecture, 
furnishings, dress, music, drama, as well as in thought 
and deportment. There is nothing more refining than 
beauty. The man who has acquired the ability to per- 
ceive the truly beautiful in the varied forms in which 
it is manifest has also acquired that refinement of 
thought and impulse which will lift him above the 
coarse and ugly. When mire becomes ugly he takes 
another path. And the fact must not be overlooked 
that every man has ‘‘an art life.”’ The man who 
thinks that he does not like music means simply that 
he does not enjoy the kind of music which appeals 
to his friends. Somewhere between the tum-tum of 
the savage’s rude drum and the finished symphony is 
a variety of music which fills him with joy. Every 
man loves poetry of some order of merit between the 
illicit verse of the back alley and the lofty lines of the 
Shakespeares and Miltons. Every man likes pictures 
somewhere between the vile expressions of bestiality 
and the madonnas. The persons who enjoy the same 
types of music, verse and picture are his kindred 
spirits, to whom he flocks and with whom he has in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
THE TRAINING OF ASTHETIC JUDGMENT 365 
tercourse of soul. Two young men of equal ability 
pursued the same courses through preparatory school 
and college. They left the commencement platform 
with equal prospects. One of them had learned to 
find enjoyment in jazz music, forbidden pictures, and 
salacious verse. He died recently of alcoholic in- 
sanity. The other young man spent his life in the 
same city. He traveled the same streets, saw the 
same people, experienced the same ‘‘calls’’ from his 
environment. But he had found joy in the best of 
literature, in good music, and in real art. The sights 
and sounds which had captivated and hurried his 
friend to ruin were repulsive to him; he ran from 
them. He followed the flag of his soul elsewhere be- 
cause he had learned to find beauty elsewhere. He 
also died recently, honored the world round. Ais- 
thetic appreciation is a direct approach to ethical 
attainment. 
Training for enjoyment and discriminating judg- 
ment—Teaching of art for appreciation should seek 
to accomplish two things: (1) training the pupil to 
perceive and enjoy beauty in Music, Literature, Archi- 
tecture, Drama, Painting, Drawing, Sculpture, Land- 
scape, Dress and Deportment; (2) developing refined 
taste in each of these forms of art, and discriminat- 
ing judgment. The development of esthetic judgment 
involves (a) the establishment of norms for compari- 
son, and (b) practice in a method of analysis, compar- 
ison and synthesis leading to judgment of the artistic 
value or rating of the selection. 
How norms for judgment are established—Norms for 
comparison are established by familiarizing the pu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  366 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
pil, under pleasurable conditions, with selections which 
are accepted by competent authority to be of classical 
quality or of such merit ag deserve preservation. 
Literary judgment rests upon thorough acquaintance 
with at least a few productions of each type which 
have been accepted by literary authorities and tested 
by a long period of approval by persons of known ex- 
cellence of literary taste. This basis of judgment is 
more effective if the individual has a thorough ac- 
quaintance with a small number of the best produc- 
tions than if he has a superficial knowledge of a large 
number of books. The books we know and so well 
enjoy that we love them, become to us standards of 
literary excellence. By them, all other books are 
judged. The task and the opportunity of the teacher 
of literature is to lead the pupil to live with a small 
number of the choicest books until they have become 
a part of him, his major premise in evaluating all 
other literature. They are to his reading what the 
cornerstones of a survey are to the engineer. They 
constitute his measuring scale. Norms for musical 
judgment are established in the same manner, namely, 
by so completely familiarizing the pupil with a small 
number of great musical selections that he instine- 
tively employs them for measuring the worth of other 
music. 
Taste—Taste is a by-product of habit. Literary 
taste comes of habitual association with a type or 
grade of literature. One forms the habit of liking the 
sort of thing with which he is long associated. Musi- 
cal taste is chiefly a matter of continued exposure to 
a given kind of music. One gets the jazz habit, or one

| 
THE TRAINING OF ZSTHETIC JUDGMENT 367 
forms the habit of responding to good music. Refine- 
ment is the plane above the brute level upon which a 
man finds the desired satisfactions of his nature. Re- 
finement is secured by imitation of others who have 
become habituated to the higher level of behavior. 
In some measure it is a matter of unconscious sur- 
render to suggestion. Imitation, suggestion, habit, 
are the key-words in the cultivation of taste. 
Good judgment requires practice—To the establish- 
ment of norms of comparison must be added practice 
in the evaluation of art products in order to develop 
facility of judgment. One becomes a judge of books 
by much practice in comparison of books with stand- 
ards one has chosen. Pupils readily develop the 
habit of judging the quality of music, if they are set 
to comparing compositions analytically with the norms 
of judgment and attain surprising ability in this. An 
‘eye for architectural excellence,’’ or for choice of 
clothing materials, or mural decorations, is easily de- 
veloped by supervised practice in application of the 
norm of comparison and a few principles of technique. 
To be sure, intelligence and continuity of practice 
here as elsewhere are necessary to the attainment of 
expert ability, but with even their limited resources 
the high school music and art departments may ac- 
complish much in stimulating higher and more active 
taste in the community. 
Pupil needs method of analysis—The pupil will need 
a method of attack, or of analysis and synthesis, to 
enable him to approach the study of a piece of art, mu- 
sic or literature independently and systematically. 
Schemes for the study of different types of literature
-P-A-G-E-386
  368 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
have been suggested in the chapters on English. A 
similar scheme of study has been employed in the 
study of pictures with evident success, and will be 
suggested further on in this discussion. With slight 
modification this scheme may also be used in the study 
of other art forms. 
The reader is referred to the chapter on Mental 
Processes for the discussion of the psychology of ap- 
preciation. It is sufficient for our immediate purpose 
to recall that to appreciate means to enjoy, to feel 
inherent worth, and to be devoted to or loyal. The 
basis of appreciation is the emotional experience aris- 
ing from the motor responses awakened by the ob- 
ject of appreciation. Appreciation of a musical com- 
position develops from the feelings evoked by the 
“‘physical play,’? or motor response, called forth in 
the hearer by the music. If this response is definite 
and allowed free scope, the accompanying feeling will 
be deeper and more likable. The mind instinctively 
regards anything as valuable, and worthy of personal 
support, which gives pleasure. That is, all art was 
originally a mode of behavior or a means of regulating 
behavior, and is most readily entered into through 
stimulating in the pupil those motor experiences with 
which the art form was originally associated. 
Dramatic Work in the High School 
Literature shares with music the position of promi- 
nence in the art life of the people. The high school 
and college have reached an excellence in the teach- 
ing of literature which has not been approached in the
-P-A-G-E-387
THE TRAINING OF ASTHETIC JUDGMENT 369 
teaching of other arts. There is possibly more dis- 
criminating taste in literary matters than in other 
forms of art, due to the excellence of the work of the 
schools and of literary clubs. One reason for this is 
the more tangible character of literary form and con- 
tent, and the fact that English teachers have been 
readier to accept pedagogical suggestion. In recent 
years the schools have revised their program to give 
larger attention to training in conversation and public 
speech. This new feature of the English course is 
most commendable and should receive the fullest en- 
couragement. In some schools, also, formal training 
in dramatics has been introduced with immediate ben- 
efit. Dramatic portrayal is the direct natural reac- 
tion to the reading of a selection of literature and 
proves, for that reason, an invaluable aid to the pu- 
pil in securing the fullest understanding and apprecia- 
tion of the selection. One gathers much of the thought 
and feeling of Hamlet from reading the play to one- 
self; one gathers more by witnessing the production 
of it by an artist on the stage; but one gets the fullest 
grasp of its content by playing Hamlet. Dramatic 
training has, therefore, an important function in the 
English course as a supplement to the study of litera- 
ture. 
There is another and, possibly, larger function of 
school dramatics of the proper kind, in developing a 
wholesome dramatic taste and dramatic judgment. 
Those pupils who are permitted the opportunity to 
participate in well-chosen school plays under compe- 
tent direction acquire a taste for the finer things in 
dramatic art which makes them discriminating in their
-P-A-G-E-388
370 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
patronage of public theatricals. The same result is 
experienced in private theatrical clubs. The debased 
stage is explained by the conscienceless greed of pur- 
veyers, and the utter lack of training of the masses 
in dramatic judgment. The cheap and ugly are 
foisted upon the public because the public has had no 
opportunity for the training which would enable it to 
judge for itself and express its demand for better 
things. What larger social service, among the many 
possible contributions, can the high school render 
than to prepare its students to resent the exploita- 
tion of the public by these persons whom we have un- 
fortunately permitted to secure a monopoly of the 
American stage? 
The Graphic Arts 
The psychology of drawing and painting is simple. 
With the race, and with the individual, drawing be- 
gins in the effort to represent things as they are re- 
membered, and develops into the ability to represent 
things as they are perceived. Two elements are em- 
ployed. At first, the line only is used to represent 
pattern and perspective. Later color is introduced, 
first to secure contrast, and later to show perspective. 
In graphic art, appreciation is governed chiefly by the 
lines taking such direction as permits the eye to fol- 
low with the least effort, and by symmetry or balanc- 
ing of the content of the field of vision. The modern 
' slang phrase ‘‘Hasy to look at,’’ expresses the funda- 
mental principle of the psychology of art apprecia- 
tion.
-P-A-G-E-389
THE TRAINING OF ZSTHETIC JUDGMENT 371 
The two classes of pupils—Two classes of pupils 
are to be served in the high school. There are the few 
gifted individuals who deserve the opportunity to cul- 
tivate their talents intensively, and for whom the 
course of study should be organized to develop grasp 
of theory, including the history of art and technique, 
and skill in expression or production, as well as ap- 
preciation. There is the far larger class, including 
properly all other students in the school, who possess 
no particular talent for artistic expression, but who 
will have in fact far larger need of artistic judgment 
than the few who are specializing in art activities. 
They need training for consumption of art goods while 
the first class is being trained for production. This 
second class really has greater need of art training 
for its particular needs than has the first class, but 
for the most part the schools bave utterly failed to 
supply its need. What this class needs is enough 
of facility in handling pencil and brush to supplement 
the individual’s vernacular in his effort to express 
his thoughts; elementary drawing purely as language 
and with no purpose of making an artist of him. The 
larger thing which he needs, however, is the train- 
ing which will give him good judgment in selecting 
his neckties and making the numberless other choices 
involving the exercise of esthetic judgment. The 
point which this chapter is endeavoring to make is 
that a democratic education will provide those varie- 
ties of training which will enable the common man to 
think and choose for himself intelligently. No form 
of judgment is required of the average man and 
‘woman more frequently, and with more consequence to 
‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  372 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
his happiness and moral and material welfare, than 
the esthetic judgment, and particularly judgment of 
art values. Therefore, if the high school is to be 
democratic in the department of art instruction it must 
provide a course of instruction and training which will 
give to all of the pupils of the school at least an ele- 
mentary training in this variety of judgment. 
This course of training for artistic judgment will 
seek to fix in the pupil’s mind a set of norms as stand- 
ards of comparison. There are certain principles of 
composition of lines and colors which he must under- 
stand. Most of all, however, he needs practice in the 
judging of the art values of dress-materials, furniture, 
house-furnishings, color-schemes of houses, architec- 
tural features, landscape plans, and the other features 
of the life of the community which involve art judg- 
ment. Much of the work in such a course should be 
done in the field. It should be made as immediately 
practical as possible. 
Rich content of graphic art—Graphic art is second 
only to literature in the wealth of its content. Much 
of the world’s greatest thought and emotional experi- 
ence is stored up for us in the art classics. In a well- 
balanced education this content has as much place in 
the program of study as literature. The art course 
which omits the introduction of the pupil to the treas- 
ures of the world’s galleries is as imperfect as the 
course in English which omits any study of literary 
classics. The high school graduate has the right to 
a general acquaintance with the great pictures of the 
world, and to an intimate acquaintance with a few 
chosen to be his friends, in his effort to evaluate other

THE TRAINING OF ASTHETIC JUDGMENT 373 
pictures. The need of this service on the part of the 
school is beyond question to one who has observed 
the collection of stuff found in the average middle- 
class home. 
Art products offer a field of interpretative study 
only less valuable than literature, and only slightly 
less tangible. There have been many schemes sug- 
gested for picture study which are feasible. The fol- 
lowing adaptation of the form for study of a literary 
classic has been used in picture study with decided 
success. 
Form for Study of a Picture 
I. The title? Why chosen? 
II. The meaning of the picture. 
1. The human figures in the picture: 
Who are represented ? 
What kind of people are they? 
What are they doing? 
What are they thinking? 
How do they feel? 
How are they dressed? 
To what time and place do they belong? 
What is the central figure? 
2. Other objects and elements introduced: 
‘What objects other than persons are in- 
troduced? 
Time of day, month, season, shown in the 
picture? 
3. Of what was the artist thinking in painting 
this picture?  
-P-A-G-E-392
  374 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
How did he feel with reference to it? 
What was his purpose—to instruct? 
to entertain? 
to enforce a les- 
son? 
Are the expressions, action, pose, kind of 
people, and dress of persons appropri- 
ate for this purpose? ; 
Are the other objects and elements ap- 
propriate for this purpose? 
III. The Composition: 
1. What kinds of lines are used? Are they 
true? Are they pleasing? Are they har- 
monious? 
2. What colors are used? Are they true? 
Are they harmonious? 
3. Are light and shade employed? Where 
disposed? How do they affect the lines? 
How do they affect the colors? 
4, Is the perspective true as to lines? As to 
colors? As to light and shade? 
5. Does the picture properly fill the space? 
Are the objects so distributed as to balance 
properly? 
Bs persons? 
of setting? 
of lines? 
of color? 
o light and 
shade? 
IV. Does this picture please you? Why? What contrasts are employed
-P-A-G-E-393
  THE TRAINING OF ASTHETIC JUDGMENT 375 
V. What do you know of the artist? What other 
pictures has he painted? 
VI. What other pictures does this one suggest? In 
what respects? 
Portions of the preceding outline have been em- 
ployed in the study of individual trees, of bits of 
scenery, and of landscape effects, sculpture and archi- 
tectural subjects. The teacher is expected, of course, 
to make such modifications ag the nature of the subject 
requires. The important thing is to supply the pu- 
pil with a definite mode of attack which includes the 
consideration of the principles of perspective, color- 
ing, symmetry, and pattern. 
Music 
Music was developed originally to regulate move- 
ment in the march, the dance, or other group action. 
The basic element is rhythm, and the music of primi- 
tive tribes is confined to this element. Other ele- 
ments were introduced in the following order: Accent, 
Tone, Motif, and Harmony. This order of introduc- 
tion gives the natural sequence of presentation of the 
elements of technique. Musical appreciation is based 
in the ‘‘physical play,’’ or motor reaction, stimulated 
in the hearer. This fact is readily demonstrated by 
experience with selections which differ in the degree 
of motor reaction called forth, and gives the teacher 
the clue to the most direct method of developing ap- 
preciation. Each selection calls out an appropriate 
motor response. If this response is easy and har- 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  376 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
monious in its various movements, the effect is pleas- 
ing. Information with reference to the history of 
the composition, the experience of the composer in the 
composition of the production, and any other facts 
which go to give it standing as a mode of expression, 
will help to arouse a favorable attitude. The essen- 
tial thing to bear in mind is that the selection is de- 
signed to secure certain regulated movements in the 
audience, and the problem of the teacher is to encour- 
age and give free course to these natural reactions. 
The dance, in the larger meaning of the term, the 
march, the concert or co-operative movement of the 
group, are the forms which this reaction takes, and 
the emotional experience accompanying the reaction 
is the basal element in appreciation. This fact is sug- 
gestive in connection with the effort to control the 
modern dance. The ‘‘low’’ dance is the immediate 
result of the ‘‘jazz band’’ which is a reversion toward 
primitive types of music. In return, indulgence in 
the primitive dance fosters appreciation of ‘‘jazz’’ 
music. Obviously the most direct method of dealing 
with the matter is to provide a higher type of music 
at social functions. 
The three types of musical instruction—There are 
three types of musical instruction: the training which 
seeks to produce the technician, that which develops 
the composer, and that which aims at the training of 
the listener. The last type of training is of chief im- 
portance in the high school. That is, the type which 
should prevail is the training of the majority who 
will ‘‘consume’’ music, rather than the few who may 
become producers; training for musical appreciation
-P-A-G-E-395
  THE TRAINING OF ASSTHETIC JUDGMENT 377 
and judgment rather than for execution. This course 
will involve enough of theory to make the pupil intel- 
ligent in discussion, enough of practice in singing to 
enable the individual to employ this mode of expres- 
sion in ordinary situations, and enough technical mas- 
tery to enable him to read music and identify elements 
of composition. The principal effort should be de- 
voted to cultivating such intimate acquaintance with a 
limited number of musical masterpieces that he may 
acquire a taste for the worth-while music, and a set 
of norms for musical judgment. As suggested above, 
in the study of a masterpiece the pupils should not 
only be informed of the history of the production and 
its psychological aspects, together with the facts of 
the language employed, but they should be led to re- 
produce the motor reactions which the selection is 
disposed to call forth. This dramatization of the pro- 
duction has the same significance in musical culture 
as in the study of literature. 
Considerable attention may well be paid to the gen- 
eral survey of musical classics and their connection 
with the general history of their times and places. 
One should know the world’s music as he knows its 
great literature and its masterpieces of art. Sacred 
music should receive special consideration with a view 
to elevating taste in the matter of church music. Spe- 
cial attention should also be given to the popular stuff 
with which the country is flooded, looking toward help- 
ing the young people to make a proper classification 
of such material. The cultivation of taste for real 
music and the ability to pass adequate judgment upon 
the quality of compositions is of the utmost value to
-P-A-G-E-396
  378 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the public. The high school has a great opportunity 
for distinguished social service in setting wholesome 
musical standards for the community. 
In all of the foregoing discussion the thought has 
been that each of the arts has a content and a language 
which has a necessary place in the scheme of second- 
ary training; that the individual has the right to suffi- 
cient training in each of the arts to explore his abili- 
ties, and to cultivate any special talent thus revealed; 
but that from the standpoint of social progress the 
important function of art teaching in the high school 
is the development of exsthetic judgment and high- 
level taste. This esthetic judgment and appreciation 
of the higher types of art products has many values: 
an economic significance, a large cultural value, and 
an immense moral influence. 
The following excerpt from the outline of instruc- 
tions to teachers of music issued by the Department 
of Public Instruction in the State of Indiana is perti- 
nent at this point in the chapter: 
‘*Besides vocal music, the pupils may under favorable con- 
ditions become acquainted with some good standard instru- 
mental pieces. In most high schools some of the pupils play 
the piano or other instruments skilfully, and the teacher will 
do well to have such pupils play for their fellow pupils. 
“The use of music reproducing instruments is heartily 
endorsed and is coming into prominence in the schools as 
in the home. A piano-player is of great value in the pre- 
sentation of the best compositions of the greatest composers 
and adds greatly to musical appreciation, which is a part of 
musical and cultural education. 
“The Graphonola, Victrola, and the Edison Phonograph
-P-A-G-E-397
THE TRAINING OF ASSTHETIC JUDGMENT 379 
are especially valuable in that they are portable and easily 
taken from room to room. The range of selections covers 
instrumental, vocal, orchestral, and band compositions. 
“Courses of instruction may easily be arranged so that 
the work of a special composer or group of composers may 
be studied and appreciated. In this way musical taste may 
be developed in a way impossible before the development of 
these instruments. 
Summary 
The teaching of art may be addressed to anyone 
or all of three objectives: (1) a mastery of technique, 
of the theory of the art, and the principles of compo- 
sition; (2) the production of the artist who creates or 
reproduces; and (3) the development of appreciation 
and training of esthetic judgment. 
The result aimed at in the first case is the science 
of art and art processes; in the second, the creative 
and interpretative artist; and in the third, apprecia- 
tive ability and cultivated taste. Hach variety of abil- 
ity may involve the other two, but the correlation is 
not necessary, nor so generally present as is usually 
assumed. 
While the high school should provide for all three 
varieties of art training, for the great majority, and 
socially, training for appreciation and judgment is 
of chief importance. 
The ‘‘language’’ of the arts has a practical utiltiy 
for every life which cannot well be lost. Enough 
training is demanded to give to the individual posses- 
sion of these supplemental languages. 
The great majority of persons are consumers rather
-P-A-G-E-398
  380 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
than producers of art products. They need to be 
trained in their judgment of values. Such training 
would lead to enormous economic betterment of the 
masses. 
The moral character of the people is greatly in- 
fluenced by the quality of their pleasure life. Noth- 
ing is more debasing than vulgarity—vulgarity in 
architecture, furnishings, dress, music, drama, as well 
as in thought and deportment. Beauty is refining. 
The esthetic standards of a community have the ut- 
most moral significance. 
Teaching art for appreciation involves: (1) train- 
ing of pupils to perceive and enjoy beauty in the vari- 
ous arts, and (2) development of refined taste in each. 
Norms of art judgment are established by familiar- 
izing the pupil, under pleasurable conditions, with 
art products which are accepted by competent author- 
ity as deserving preservation. 
Taste is a product of enjoyment and habit. Ats- 
thetic judgment is strengthened by giving the pupil 
practice in the use of a method of criticism. 
The primary object of high school dramatics is the 
improvement of dramatic taste. 
The school is expected to provide courses in the 
graphic arts for the development of the few who have 
talent for these modes of expression, but, on the whole, 
it renders a larger service in providing the student 
body with facilities for an enjoyable acquaintance 
with the great masterpieces of painting, sculpture and 
architecture, just as the music department will make 
the world’s classic musical compositions familiar. 
The plans for the analytic study of literary master-
-P-A-G-E-399
THE TRAINING OF ASSTHETIC JUDGMENT 381 
pieces may with slight modifications be employed in 
the study of pictures. 
Possibly the best particular social service the high 
school can render is the cultivation of taste for real 
music and the ability to pass adequate judgment upon 
the quality of musical compositions.

CHAPTER XIX 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL 
Physical deterioration of the American people—One 
of the most hopeful aspects of modern education is 
the increasing, intelligent concern with reference to 
the physical development of our boys and girls. That 
this interest is belated is manifest in the alarming 
conditions which the more accurate information of re- 
cent years reveals. The reports of the medical serv- 
ice of the army in the late war indicate that American 
physical manhood has seriously deteriorated. The 
following excerpt from an official statement should 
cause us to realize how serious the situation is. 
“‘Some will argue that we need lay no special empha- 
sis upon physical training, because through past years 
men and women have reached mature age in good 
health. This statement is based upon the general ap- 
pearance of the American people. However, appear- 
ances are quite deceiving. Sixty-eight per cent of our 
young men, when put to the test, fail to meet the na- 
tion’s approved physical requirements. Many con- 
tain the beginning of degenerative diseases, such as 
apoplexy, heart trouble, diseases of the veins, arter- 
ies, kidneys, and other vital organs. What has been 
said concerning the young men is also true of the young 
women.’’ 
It is true that the death rate has been reduced, but 
383
-P-A-G-E-402
  384 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
this is through improved sanitation, and the better 
control of communicable diseases. The death rate 
due to degenerative diseases has increased. The avy- 
erage span of life is longer, but because of the reduc- 
tion of infant mortality. The death rate above 
fifty years of age is alarmingly increased. Infant 
mortality is due chiefly to malnutrition and communi- 
cable disease; adult mortality to degenerative disease, 
that is, to the breaking down of tissues and functions, 
resulting from low vitality. ‘‘Men and women die 
in the prime of life because their vital organs are not 
strong.’’ Another excerpt from the Indiana State 
Manual on Physical Education, Bulletin No 36, 
is in point. ‘‘Vitality, or organic power, is fun- 
damental for physical and mental efficiency. The 
vital organs are best developed through the muscular 
activities that are common to all healthy children. 
The child runs and jumps in order that the heart, 
veins and arteries may become strong, that the lungs 
may be fully developed, that the nerve-centers may 
be justly co-ordinated, and that other vital organs may 
function properly. If we take these activities away 
from the child and the youth; rather, if we do not 
insist that the child and youth engage in vigorous 
muscular activities, then the inevitable result must 
follow; indeed, we have the result, namely, an adult 
race of men and women with weak vital organs who 
succumb easily to the attack of degenerative dis- 
eases.’’ 
Physical education for the preservation of the Ameri- 
can stock—A more general and systematic physical 
education manifestly is necessary for the preservation 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL 385 
of the American stock. A people can be no better 
than its arteries; no better than its vitality. Little 
progress has been made if we reduce infant mortality, 
only to increase the number of persons with insuf- 
ficient vital power to combat the foes of health. Un- 
less the American people can maintain a degree of vi- 
tality in excess of the minimum requirements of aver- 
age life, ‘‘the blood will run out.’? Man has no ex- 
emption from the biological laws which govern the 
upkeep of farm herds and grains. A herd whose vi- 
tality is not kept well above the existence level will 
vanish by exhaustion. 
Health the greatest material asset—Physical health 
is the nation’s greatest material asset. This is true 
for the reason that physical health conditions every 
human activity and situation. Social efficiency is, 
fundamentally, a matter of physical development. 
The worker, whether the manual laborer or the highly 
specialized professional man, works by means of his 
body. The body is the tool of the mind. It is the 
instrument with which the mind relates itself to its 
environment, and with which it executes its will on 
this environment. The street-cleaner works with his 
body, the lawyer pleads his case with his body, the 
physician uses nerve and muscle, the preacher urges 
the divine law through the instrumentality of voice, 
pose and gesture. The brain-worker uses vital en- 
ergy. Blood is the essential partner of mind in every 
human enterprise. The quantity and quality of blood 
supply is the measure of social efficiency. The nation — 
cannot rise higher than the ability of its men and 
women to carry the ordinary loads of life without  
-P-A-G-E-404
  386 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
undue fatigue. At the present time American man- 
hood is using up its vital capital. Our native stock 
is deteriorating; our young men are not physically 
capable of standing up under the burden and strain 
of modern industrial and professional life. Our 
young women are less capable of performing the nor- 
mal duties of wifehood and motherhood without ex- 
haustion. Our productive and reproductive powers 
are both threatened. The only source of safety is 
in a proper system of physical education. 
Human life on a physical basis—Psychology has 
shown us that learning as well as doing is a psycho- 
physical process. The efficiency of the pupil in the 
classroom depends upon his supply of vitality. His 
susceptibility to impression and his power of retention 
are conditioned by the plasticity of his brain tissue. 
His rate and vigor of reaction depend on the quantity 
and quality of his blood supply. These, in truth, 
depend upon the vigor of heart, lungs, liver, stomach, 
arteries, and eliminating organs, and these upon the 
use of the muscles while the pupil is growing up. 
Physical training is valuable as an adjunct to the 
classroom, increasing the learning and memory- 
functions of the pupils. 
Character grounded in physical stamina—In another 
chapter stress is laid upon physical development as 
a condition of character education and personality. 
The sickly pupil, ordinarily, sees life and its relations 
through distorted lenses. His perspective is twisted 
by self-consciousness, and his vision colored by his 
bodily feelings. Force of personality is partly pro- 
duced by the definiteness of moral principle, but
-P-A-G-E-405
PHYSICAL EDUCATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL 387 
more largely by the degree of vitality. The first 
phase of moral education is a vigorous, well-balanced 
body development. 
National stability is largely rooted in the general 
happiness of the people, and happiness is the first 
fruit of health. The glow of good feeling which ac- 
companies normal vital functions is the physical basis 
of personal contentment. This, in turn, is the emo- 
tional basis of social stability. 
Objectives in the High School 
The objectives of physical training in the high 
school are three: 
1. Physical development, with cultivation of 
proper insight into the laws of health, the estab- 
lishment of proper physiological habits, the co- 
ordination of mind and body, the development 
of dexterity of body. 
2. Recreation. 
3. Moral training. 
The physical exercises required of the pupils should 
be accompanied by instruction in the underlying prin- 
ciples and the results to be secured. The course in 
hygiene should be co-ordinated with the program of 
exercises in the gymnasium. The physical ‘‘work- 
out’’ will demonstrate the significance of the hygienic 
instruction, and the insights into the laws of correct 
living will provide an adequate motivation for the 
work of the gymnasium. Further, it is as important
-P-A-G-E-406
  388 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to assure the continuation of good physical conditions 
through the establishment of proper habits of living 
as it is to give the pupil normal development through 
his school years. These habits will include sitting 
and standing: posture, eating, drinking, sleeping, 
breathing, daily physical exercise, and the eliminat- 
ing functions. 
The play impulse—Play is a prominent factor in 
normal life. In childhood and youth it is the pri- 
mary activity. Play-activity is fundamentally motor. 
‘‘All normal boys and girls are interested in some 
form of physical aetivity. This interest, when ex- 
pressed in wholesome gymnastic exercises and games, 
tends to make the body strong and keep it well. To 
run, to jump, to kick, to swing, to throw, to catch, to 
yell, in general to play, is natural to all children. 
Nature demands that children do such things, in order 
that they pass safely through the motor active period 
of life. So strong is this desire for physical activity 
that children will play under the most discouraging 
conditions and dangerous surroundings.’’ The play 
instinct must be satisfied, and finds its natural expres- 
sion in games which are predominantly motor. The 
program of physical education must make large provi- 
sion for this recreational element. So strong is the 
native demand for play that the best results are 
secured by organizing the developmental exercises 
into games and contests. This involves the provi- 
sion of school athletics controlled in accordance with 
the principles of physical and moral training. 
Since the play-life of youth is so large a factor in 
the making of character, and at the same time is nat-
-P-A-G-E-407
PHYSICAL EDUCATION OF THE ape SCHOOL PUPIL 389 
urally disposed to take the form of physical activity, 
the character values should always be held prom- 
inently in mind. It is not extravagant to say that the 
physical director has more intimate contacts with the 
student body, and more influence in determining their 
moral ideals than any other member of the faculty. 
His responsibility is proportionate, and the selection 
of the staff of coaches, gymnasium leaders, and other 
assistants in this department, one of the utmost con- 
sequence for the community. As observed elsewhere, 
the person who controls the recreation of the com- 
munity controls its morals. The physical training 
staff should be employed on an all-year basis, and 
given charge of the physical play-life of the com- 
munity. 
Phases of Training 
There must, therefore, be three phases of training 
provided: 
(1) Body-building and hygiene. 
(2) Corrective gymnastics. 
(3) Recreation. 
The first phase will aim at securing standardized 
development of the student body, and proper instruc- 
tion in the principles of hygiene. The second phase 
aims at giving individual attention to those pupils who 
are defective in development. This special attention 
implies that all pupils have been given a standard 
examination, and that all who are not reasonably 
normal in development have been given a prescription
-P-A-G-E-408
  
  390 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to be carried out in individual work or in small groups. 
To do this individual work properly requires special- 
ist training on the part of the director; the co- 
operation of the director and the school physician; 
and that the student who applies for an excuse from 
physical training shall be given individual training 
rather than exemption from the one thing of which 
he is in greatest need. 
The Course of Training 
The program of physical training will comprise: 
(1) Physical examination of all pupils, and clas- 
sification with reference to physical ability 
and needs rather than by mental development 
or physical age. 
(2) Graduated progressive gymnasium exercises. 
(8) Organized athletic sports, including aquatics. 
(4) Application of physical efficiency tests for the 
purpose of proper motivation as well as 
measuring of results. 
The physical examination, which should be made 
by a specialist, should include the condition of vital 
organs and their functions, motor-ability, height, 
weight, and scope of recreational activity. Individ- 
ual records should be kept by both pupil and instruc- 
tor, with notation of deviation from norms. This 
examination should be repeated from time to time in 
order to measure development, and the records should 
be corrected accordingly. There are many acceptable 
manuals of instruction in hygiene available, and like-
-P-A-G-E-409
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL 391 
wise quite satisfactory manuals of gymnastic ex- 
ercises. Suggestions are offered at the end of the - 
chapter. \ 
The practice of some schools to incorporate sex in- 
struction in the course of physical training and hy- 
giene is of exceedingly doubtful wisdom, and is not 
here recommended. Such courses are too generally 
suggestive to the youthful curiosity and disposed to 
inflame morbid imaginations. The most effective sex- 
training, after all, is to fix the youthful heart upon 
the attainment of perfect physical development, to- 
gether with the ideals of chivalry. 
Athletic sports are fixed for the high school by con- 
vention. Football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis, 
swimming, diving, and various indoor contests, with 
proper adaptation to the ability and development of 
high school youth, are all legitimate in the high school 
athletic program. Possibly the most questionable of 
the several sports named is basketball for the reason 
that it offers strong temptation to overstrenuous play- 
ing, and to a prolonged season. With sensible coach- 
ing and management of contests, football is a good 
high school sport. Two dangers must be constantly 
met in high school athletics: (1) the neglect of the 
mass of students in order to concentrate the resources 
of the school upon a small squad of able players; (2) 
over-training of players, and specialization. Both of 
these dangers arise from the very nature of inter- 
scholastic athletics, thus raising very emphatic ques- 
tion as to the wisdom of such contests. The small 
advantage in the form of school spirit does not at all 
offset the grave losses to the student body.
-P-A-G-E-410
  392 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Efficiency Tests 
In order to give pupils a definite objective toward 
which to work, and also a means of determining the 
degree of improvement secured, a system of stand- 
ardized physical measurements has been devised. 
These have been found to have the same educational 
value as the measuring scales in academic subjects. 
The use of this physical scale may also be made to 
stimulate zeal for the work of this department, which 
quite generally becomes irksome without some mate- 
rial objective, by preparing an emblem of physical 
efficiency to be awarded to each student who reaches 
the norm for his class. The following norms have 
been standardized :

Summary 
A more general and systematic physical education 
is necessary for the preservation of the American 
stock, as well as the condition of physical and mental 
efficiency. Man has no exemption from the biological 
laws which govern the upkeep of farm herds and 
grains. A herd whose vitality is not kept well above 
the existence level will vanish by exhaustion. 
Physical health is the nation’s greatest material 
asset. Social efficiency is fundamentally a matter of
-P-A-G-E-414
  396 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
physical development. Human life is on a physical 
basis. 
The character of the individual, and of the people, 
is grounded in physical stamina. Happiness is the 
first fruit of health, and national stability is largely 
rooted in the general happiness of the people. 
Recreation, also, is a legitimate objective in the pro- 
gram of physical training. Play is a prominent 
factor in normal life. Play-activity is fundamentally 
motor. The physical program, therefore, must make 
Jarge provision for the recreational element. 
The phases of physical training to be provided are: 
(1) general body-building and hygiene, (2) corrective 
gymnastics, and (3) recreation. 
The program will comprise: (1) the physical ex- 
amination of all pupils, (2) graduated progressive 
gymnasium exercises, (3) organized athletic sports, in- 
cluding aquatics, (4) application of physical efficiency 
tests for the purpose of proper motivation as well as 
for measuring results.

  CHAPTER XX 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
The high school period the time for vocational de- 
cisions—A vital function of secondary education is 
the guidance of the pupil in choosing his life-work. 
The adolescent period is pre-eminently the time of 
vocational decision. The records in college and 
university offices indicate that in many institutions as 
high as eighty-five per cent of the students had made 
their choice of vocation before registration. To be 
sure, many of these choices were changed sub- 
sequently, and properly so, yet the experience of 
college administrators goes to show that the high 
school period is the time when the individual is ripe 
for consideration of this most vital question. 
Evidence from ministerial candidates—An interesting 
bit. of evidence of the truth of the last statement is 
produced incidentally in some recent surveys to deter- 
mine the reason for the diminishing number of can- 
didates for the Gospel ministry in the Protestant com- 
munions. It is found that the downward curve in the 
number of candidates corresponds exactly with the 
downward curve in the number of secondary students 
receiving their preparation for college entrance in 
church colleges, or in private classes conducted by 
ministers. In these church-controlled schools, the 
claims of the ministry as a vocation are brought per- 
399
-P-A-G-E-418
400 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
sistently to the attention of the student during his 
early adolescent period when he is ripe for suggestion. 
The result is a high percentage of choices of the min- 
istry in proportion to the number of students reached. 
Prior to the last quarter of a century a majority of 
secondary students were in these sectarian schools, 
but during the last twenty-five years this class of 
schools has almost disappeared. In the secular 
schools the claims of the ministry have not been pre- 
sented, with the result that most students have made 
their vocational choices before the sacred calling was 
brought to their consideration. It is the judgment of 
those conversant with the facts in the educational and 
church situations, and who know boy nature, that the 
explanation of the diminishing ministerial supply is 
not due to the unattractiveness of the ministry to 
modern youth so much as to the accident of present- 
ing the matter to the young men after the best of them 
have made their decisions. It is a matter of sowing 
the seed after the proper season has passed. 
This function of the school of utmost social im- 
portance—No one will question the vital significance 
of right vocational choice, nor will any one deny that 
the many and difficult factors to be considered by the 
boy in coming to his decision on any proposed vocation 
constitute a complicated and difficult problem, a prob- 
lem which is beyond the unaided powers of the high 
school boy. This means that the high school has the 
direction of the youth during the period when he must 
consider a problem most vital to his own personal 
happiness and welfare, and to that of his future family, 
and of society in general; and that the nature of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-419
  
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 401 
problem requires that the youth shall have painstaking 
and intelligent assistance. The boy needs the help 
of the school, and society needs that he be helped by 
the school. Possibly no other single thing has greater 
social consequence than the making of the right choice 
of a career. Primitive peoples recognize this fact in 
elaborate initiatory rites to celebrate the passing of 
the youth from childhood to the responsibilities of 
adult life. Thus, from both standpoints, that of the 
individual, and that of society at large, this function 
imposes upon the school a great responsibility and 
confers upon it a great privilege. No body of knowl- 
edge which the school can impart, no training it can 
give in liberal and mechanical arts, is so important 
to the individual and to the state, as guidance of the 
boy through the period of his rebirth. The most 
definite provision made by the school should be that 
for meeting this responsibility. The wisest and 
strongest teacher available should be procured for 
this service. 
Principles to be observed by the teacher—The 
teacher should be governed by certain principles. 
The first is that the early adolescent years are the 
period of vocational consideration rather than of voca- 
tional choices. It is a mistake to push the student to 
a decision except under conditions which appear in 
a subsequent paragraph. An intelligent conclusion 
cannot be formed with reference to certain callings, 
until the individual has reached greater maturity and 
has had opportunity to try himself out through the 
scope and variety of advanced study. He must have 
time to make sure of his special abilities and to know 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
  402 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the nature of the calling. Many decisions ought not 
to be made until near the end or at the close of the 
college course. The boy should not be pushed to a 
hurried decision. The first principle is that the objec- 
tive of vocational guidance in the high school is, pri- 
marily, to direct the student to an honest and intel- 
ligent consideration of the several callings open to 
him, getting the advantages and disadvantages of each 
before him, and also an adequate conception of the 
natural qualifications, and the kind and amount of 
training necessary to success in each calling.. It is 
not the proper object of the high school in every case 
to cause the pupil to come to a decision prior to finish- 
ing the high school course. 
The second principle is that society needs that the 
high school shall undertake the very delicate but ex- 
ceedingly important function of the selective agency 
which shall sift out the individual pupils according to 
native ability and direct them at once into the chan- 
nels which lead to the life-work for which they are 
natively fitted. The high school boy whose native 
abilities best fit him for electrical construction work 
should be brought to choose that vocation at once, and 
not be allowed to drive along into a profession in 
which he cannot succeed. Society, like a great army, 
is in need of all the ‘‘born’’ electrical construction 
men available, and can ill afford to have any good 
workmen spoiled in order to produce a third-rate 
doctor or shyster lawyer, who are not needed. On 
the other hand, society sorely needs doctors and 
teachers and preachers, and cannot afford to have any 
good material for these and other professions side-
-P-A-G-E-421
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 403 
tracked in any other kind of work. This selective 
function of the school imposes a very grave respon- 
sibility. 
A third principle requires that the individual shall 
be permitted and encouraged to make his own choice 
of a vocation, just as later he should choose his own 
wife. The school should present all callings fairly, 
with no effort to ‘‘propagandize’’ in behalf of any 
particular calling. The teacher should avoid the ef- 
fort, and the temptation, to enforce his own opinions 
on the pupil. His duty is to get the facts before the 
pupil with proper discrimination of the factors to be 
considered, leaving the pupil to form his own con- 
clusions. 
The vocation of home-making—In presenting the 
claims of the several vocations there is one of such 
general importance, both social and personal, that it 
deserves very earnest and intelligent consideration, 
the vocation of marriage and home-making. The 
great majority of the pupils in the high school will be 
married within a few years after the completion of the 
course. Marriage calls for all of the intelligence and 
special knowledge which the individual may acquire. 
The home and the church are so negligent or incapable 
of wise guidance in this important step that the school 
should come to the rescue. That there is need of 
training all thoughtful people recognize; that there is 
need prior to marriage of the proper conception of 
the duties, responsibilities of and qualifications for 
marriage and home-making, the records of the civil 
courts clearly attest. Since all but a negligible few 
will eventually become nusbands and wives, and fa-
-P-A-G-E-422
  404 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
thers and mothers, what greater social service could 
the school perform than to provide such instruction 
as would enable the individual to enter upon the duties 
of the primary social institution with intelligent con- 
ceptions and a sensible attitude? Certainly the high 
school is in a position to render this service. It 
should do so in connection with its general program 
of vocational guidance. 
Suggestions for study of the most prominent voca- 
tions—In the following pages are offered in the form 
of loose outlines, some suggestions for discussion of 
the several more important callings. These outlines 
are not presented as exhaustive, but are meant to be 
merely suggestive of the lines of thought which will 
serve to get the case of each calling before the mind of 
the pupil. They are taken from a presentation made 
several times before college freshmen, where they 
were found to be stimulating and helpful in organiz- 
ing the students’ thinking. The topics for discussion 
are thrown into the form of arguments for and 
against the vocation. In many instances, of course, 
the objection cited is not really an objection, but a 
danger to be expected and avoided. The teacher is 
supposed to amplify the outlines as time and resources 
permit. 
These studies may take the form of assembly-room 
talks with the entire school, but better results will be 
secured if they are organized into a course to run in 
daily or at least twice-a-week lessons with smaller 
groups. The presentation should consist of talks by 
the teacher, questions submitted for discussion, library 
assignments and reports. Advantage should be taken

also of opportunities for ‘‘heart-to-heart talks’’ with 
individuals and small groups.

and private morality, 
(b) The principles of organized society, 
(c) The motivation which leads to constant 
progress in civilization, and the per- 
manence of our institutions, 
(d) Morale. 
3. The minister enjoys the highest social recog- 
nition. 
4, His life is protected from the rougher con- 
tacts of life. 
5. He is the recipient of many material favors 
which go far to compensate for the meager- 
ness of his salary. 
6. The joys which he experiences in his victories 
are the keenest satisfactions possible for a 
man. 
7. His contacts are the most stimulating. 
8. The heroism of the ministry. 
The drawbacks to the ministry as a calling. 
1. The meagerness of remuneration, denying to 
him and his family the luxuries and many of

group, together with the lack of opportunity 
for making money along collateral lines. 
2. The fruits of the ministry are necessarily of 
an intangible character. It is difficult for a 
minister to know when he has won victories; 
discouragement attends this uncertainty. He 
misses the stimulation of perceived successes. 
3. The danger of becoming so absorbed in the 
mass of routine of his ‘‘unfinished task’’ that

the source of inspiration for the group. 
5. The danger of becoming narrow-minded and 
dogmatic. 
6. The disadvantage of working for results 
which are not zealously desired by his ‘‘cli- 
ents.’’

ministry. 
(a) Personal.

good physical presence, good voice. 
2. Magnetic personality, radiating cheer, 
inviting confidence; sociability, adapt-

of people; with an active desire to help. 
4, Strong, well-balanced mentality; alert, 
resourceful, vigorous. 
5. An irreproachable moral character. 
6. An irresistible ‘‘call’’ to -preach in the 
form of the deep-seated and permanent 
feeling that this is his ‘‘job’’ and that he 
can not be happy otherwise. 
(b) The minister’s education. 
1. General. 
In view of the fact that the minister is 
appointed to take leadership of all kinds 
and classes of people, engaged in all
-P-A-G-E-431
  VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 413 
kinds of activity, and concerned with all 
varieties of human interest, it is desir- 
able that he possess the broadest and 
most liberalized academic training. The 
profession of the ministry makes larger 
demands upon general scholarship than 
any other profession. 
It is evident that history, philosophy, 
sociology, psychology, and the natural 
sciences should be major subjects in his 
course. 
It is also advisable for him to make an 
extensive study of literature and the 
classics for language-power. 
2. Special. 
The minister should be thoroughly 
grounded in theology, the Bible, church 
history, ethics and the technique of the 
ministry, as provided in a systematic 
training of three or four years of sem- 
inary study.

Summary 
Youth is the period of vocational choices. No body 
of knowledge which the school can impart, no train- 
ing it can give in liberal and industrial arts, is so im- 
portant to the individual and to the state, as guidance 
of the boy through the period of adolescence as re- 
lates to his studies, his personal problems and rela- 
tionships, and particularly his vocation. The most 
definite provision made by the school should be that 
for meeting this responsibility. The wisest and 
strongest teacher available should be procured for 
this service. 
The principles which govern the advisor are: (1) 
the early adolescent years are the period of vocational 
consideration rather than of final choices—the pupil  
-P-A-G-E-439
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 421 
should not be hurried to a decision; (2) the school 
should hold itself responsible as the selective agency, 
directing the individual into channels leading to the 
type of life-work for which he is natively fitted; (3) 
the pupil should not be subjected to undue influence 
in any direction. 
It is recommended that provision be made for the 
intelligent presentation of the principles which should 
be observed in marriage and home-making. The home 
and church are so negligent or incapable of wise 
guidance in this important step, that the school should 
come to the rescue of both the individual and society. 
Since all but the negligible few will, within a short 
time after completing their high school education, 
marry and become fathers and mothers, what better 
service can the school render than to provide such in- 
struction as will enable the individual to enter upon 
the duties of home-life with intelligent conceptions 
and a worthy attitude?

  CHAPTER XXT 
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN THE 
HIGH SCHOOL 
Personal character the directive force—Mc@uffey’s 
old ‘‘Fifth Reader’’ contains a selection entitled, 
“‘Knowledge is power.’’ This is a very true saying. 
Knowledge gives power, and technical training gives 
skill. Power and skill are valuable acquisitions under 
a certain condition; otherwise, they are harmful both 
to the possessor and to society. Knowledge and skill 
alone do not constitute social efficiency; they do not 
assure the personal happiness and welfare of the in- 
dividual possessing them. Knowledge and skill are 
like a sharp instrument; like a surgeon’s knife which 
may be used to save life or to commit murder. This 
is a fact which the discriminating educator must not 
overlook. (Academic and technical training are not 
sufficient) To neglect the training of the directive 
factor in human life is fatal. To send the petty thief 
to a school of engineering will probably get rid of 
the petty thief, but unless he is made over in his heart, 
he is pretty sure to turn his newly acquired mechani- 
eal knowledge and skill to crime on a large scale. 
To commit the science and art of medicine to a man 
whose heart is filled with lust, is to turn loose a wolf 
to prey upon the innocents of our homes. To give 
great legal ability to a man without socialized con- 
423

science, is to equip an enemy of the public welfare. 
A great American chemist won the gratitude of the 
American people by his lifelong battle for pure foods 
and unadulterated drugs. Opposed to him in this his- 
toric struggle were arrayed other great chemists, em- 
ploying the same chemical facts and processes, the 
same science and art. The equipment on both sides 
was the same. The difference was in the motivation. 
He was motivated by a conscientious regard for hu- 
man welfare; they were actuated by anti-social, there- 
fore, immoral motives. The difference was in the op- 
posing moral attitudes of the two parties. On the 
one side, eminent scholars of great skill were selling 
their ability to corporations which were striving for 
an unholy profit in the health of little children. On 
the other was this valiant champion of the people’s 
welfare, employing the same chemistry to protect their 
health and to save the lives of their children. 
The school’s responsibility for moral and religious 
education—Aeademic and technical education go 
toward determining what the individual can do; moral 
and religious education determine what he will do.) 
A wise king, long ago, learned of-man that, ‘‘As he 
thinketh in his heart so is he.’’ {Personal character 
is the ultimate directive force in human life, and ob- 
viously a scheme of education which looks to making 
the individual truly efficient for himself, and for so- 
ciety, must provide for training in fundamental mo- 
rality,] In view of the fact that religion supplies both 
the inspiration and the sanctions of private and public 
morality, the school can not divest itself completely 
of all concern for the spiritual nurture of the youth
-P-A-G-E-443
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 425 
of the nation. Particularly is this true under chang- 
ing social conditions. To be sure, this function is the 
primary business of the church and a sacred duty of 
the home, but the lamentable fact which the American 
people face to-day is the failure of both church and 
home to reach the majority of the youth of our land 
effectively. The report of the Interchurch Survey 
makes the astonishing revelation that two out of every 
three persons under the age of twenty-five years, be- 
longing to the Protestant population of the United 
States, have had no systematic moral and religious 
training. That is, they are not being touched by the 
church. That the home has, to equal extent, repudi- 
ated its responsibility in the matter is sadly true. 
After calling attention to the conditions existing, the 
report asks, ‘‘How long can a nation endure, 69.3 per 
cent of whose children and youth are receiving no 
systematic instruction in the moral and religious sanc- 
tions upon which our democratic institutions rest? 
And this question becomes acute when we learn how 
few hours of instruction are available annually for 
those children who do enroll in religious schools. If 
‘spiritual illiteracy is the forerunner of moral bank- 
ruptey and national decay,’ what are the lessons of 
these statistics?’’ 
Existing social conditions—The seriousness of the 
situation which confronts our people justifies another 
quotation at some length from the same source. It 
may be added that the same conclusion as to existing 
social conditions and the underlying causes has been 
reached by strictly lay agencies, trade journals, and 
the public press.

“‘The United States of America has been invaded by 
three enemy armies which threaten our national ex- 
istence. First, there is within our borders an army 
of five and one-half million illiterates above nine 
years of age; second, there is an army of fifty mil- 
lion people above nine years of age who are not 
identified with any church—Jewish, Catholic, or 
Protestant; third, there is an army of twenty-seven 
million Protestant children and youth, under 
twenty-five years of age, who are not enrolled in any 
Sunday School or other institution of religious 
training. 
“If these armies should form in double column, 
three feet apart, they would reach one and one-fifth 
times around the globe at the equator. If they 
should march in review before the President of the 
United States, moving double column at the rate 
of twenty-five miles a day, it would take the three 
armies three years and five months to pass the Pres- 
ident. 
“These three interlocking armies constitute a triple 
alliance which threatens the life of our democracy. 
Patriotism demands that every loyal American en- 
ist for service and wage three campaigns—a cam- 
paign of Americanization, a campaign of adult 
evangelism, and a campaign for the spiritual culture 
of childhood. 
The church, of course, should be aroused to its duty 
in this triple campaign, and the virility of the home, 
if possible, should be restored. With all that may be 
done, however, in these two directions there is large 
responsibility accruing to the public high school for
-P-A-G-E-445
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 427 
the reason that, more than any other American insti- 
tution to-day, it is reaching the youth effectively. 
The marvelous growth of the high school as the dis- 
tinctively American institution carries with it certain 
responsibilities which it dare not ignore. | Because of 
its popularity with all classes of people it becomes 
charged with functions of institutions which it has 
to some extent displaced in public favor and influence! 
Not un-American for the public school to teach 
religion—Nor should the high school longer seek to 
escape its proper concern for the spiritual welfare 
of its students on the threadbare excuse that a public 
institution must_not engage in any religious exercise. 
It is not un-American for the President of the United 
States to take the oath of office on the Holy Bible, nor 
for the Congress, state legislatures, and political con- 
ventions to open their daily sessions with prayer. 
he American doctrine of ‘‘separation of church and 
state’? means that it is repugnant to our political 
_ principles, on the one hand, to establish a state church, 
_ or for the government to intervene in the administra- 
_ tion of church bodies, and, on the other, for our gov- 
ernment or any part or institution of our government 
to come under the control of any religious organiza- 
tion.) The principle does not mean that the American 
state shall not consciously rest itself in a definite 
religious faith. Every act of the American Govern- 
ment has implied that this is a confessedly Christian 
nation, albeit full religious liberty is granted the in- 
dividual. It was by no means the thought of the 
founders of the commonwealth that education should 
be secularized; that the public school should be ag- 
   
-P-A-G-E-446
  428 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
nostic. It was emphatically their purpose that no 
public school should be controlled by a religious body, 
and that no public monies should be devoted to the 
support of church schools. That is, the American 
principle of ‘‘the separation_of-church and state,’’ as 
originally interpreted, means that the administration 
of the public schools shall be completely secularized, 
but that at the same time, public education shall be 
definitely religious. Article Three of the Ordinance 
of 1787 contains the following significant provision: 
‘‘Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary 
to good government and the happiness of mankind, 
schools and the means of education shall be forever 
encouraged.’’ The same thought is found in Wash- 
ington’s Farewell Address: ‘‘Of all the dispositions 
and habits which tend to political prosperity, religion 
and morality are indispensable supports. And let us 
with caution indulge the supposition that morality can 
be maintained without religion. Whatever may be 
conceded to the influence of refined education on minds 
of peculiar structure, reason and experience both for- 
bid us to expect that national morality can prevail in 
exclusion of religious principles,’ 
Educationally significant facts Lithe first proposition 
is that the school must in the very nature of social 
conditions, and because of the nature of educational 
functions, be.concerned with the problem of character 
education e second proposition is that this prob- 
lem belongs especially to the high schooh Some gen- 
eral reasons for this responsibility were stated, but 
the particular reason is to be found in the psychology 
of youth and of character building. The more im-
-P-A-G-E-447
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 429 
portant facts in the psychology of youth were outlined 
in an earlier chapter. But it will be worth while to re- 
fer to them again. 
Personality grow: he first of these educationally 
significant facts is that youth is the period of the 
dawning of Individuality and Personality.] By the 
former is meant those characteristics of thought, 
feeling and behavior which distinguish the individual 
from other individuals. By personality we mean the 
individual self as added to and modified by the abili- 
ties, tendencies and experiences which are distinctively 
human. Youth is the time when the individual comes 
into his full membership in the human family, and de- 
velops those powers, abilities, and characteristics 
which constitute manhood and also a particular man- 
hood. : 
Individual relates himself to society-LSecond, the 
high school age is the period in which the individual 
endeavors consciously Seen himself to his social 
and natural environmer He made adjustments 
throughout his childhood, but the process was to him 
unconscious, nondeliberate, and impersonal. Now he 
takes the initiative in the adjustments, and demands 
that they shall be made so far as possible on his own 
terms. In view of the fact that all ethical problems 
arise out of social situations and involve questions of 
the rightness and wrongness of social adjustments, it 
is obvious that the period in which the individual is 
most active in the formation of his own adjustments 
is peculiarly the ripest period for introducing him in 
a systematic manner to the entire system of morality. 
Desire for personal insight+Third, developing in
-P-A-G-E-448
430 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
connection with the first and second facts, is the 
youth’s desire for personal insight./ In the earlier 
years he was given information on the authority of 
adults. He was told what to think. He accepted the 
opinion of others without question. It did not occur 
to him to ask for evidence. Now he wants to see and 
understand for himself. He wants to form his own 
conclusions from data personally acquired, or which 
satisfy his mind as trustworthy. This fact is of 
great significance in all teaching, but particularly so 
in ethical and religious instruction in which there is 
so much temptation to dogmatism on the part of re- 
ligious leaders and teachers. The pupil should not be 
forced to acceptance of an idea on the ipse diwit of any 
one; he has the fundamental right to do his own think- 
ing. This right is constitutional. The young man 
cannot help himself; his soul demands its freedom and 
will have it. It rebels against dictation. 
Doubt—The fourth fact to receive earnest considera- 
tion in character education, because of its utmost sig- 
nificance, appears with the impulse of independent or 
personal thinking. itis the fact of intellectual doubt/ 
This trait is often the cause of confusion, distress of 
mind, and frequently of gross injustice to young peo- 
ple. By many, doubt is thought to be essentially a 
state of unfaith. This conception is seriously wrong 
and does the youth a grave injustice. The fact is that 
the adolescent is constitutionally disposed to faith, 
not, as so generally supposed, to disbelief. He wants 
to believe, but he wants to come to this belief by use 
of his own judgment, and to base this judgment on a 
foundation of intelligible fact. He wants to believe, 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 431 
but he also wants to know the reason for the belief 
if a reason is to be had. His doubt is purely a mental 
state of honest inquiry for the grounds of belief; a 
desire to understand. Doubt is not only natural to 
the adolescent, but is exceedingly desirable as a fac- 
tor in developing his personality. It is to be en- 
couraged and wisely directed rather than condemned 
and foolishly suppressed. To eliminate doubt and 
the experience of the resolution of doubt from the 
life of a boy is comparable to cutting off the tails of 
tadpoles in the effort to hurry growth into froghood. 
Intellectual doubt in the young is the index of a 
healthily active mind, and of itself gives no evidence 
of the state of the heart beyond manifesting its de- 
sire for personal apprehension of the truth. It often 
happens that the desire to believe is so strong in the 
doubter that he suffers miserably from the disturb- 
ance created in him by the efforts of his mind to 
understand for itself. The attitude of the adult to- 
ward the individual in this process of maturing 
should be obviously one of sympathy, patience, and 
suggestion, rather than one of faultfinding and re- 
pression. 
Transition from external to subjective control_The 
fifth fact of educational importance is that youth is 
the time of transition from external to subjective con- 
trol{ from control by authority imposed upon the child 
by parents, teachers and the police, to control by the 
individual’s own judgment based upon his personal 
observations and insights. This is not so much a new 
fact as a slightly different aspect of the general de- 
velopment of individuality and personality, but is in-
-P-A-G-E-450
432 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
dicative of the method of approach which must be 
increasingly adopted as the individual grows older. 
From rule to principle—Sixth, the high school age 
is also the period of transition from conduct by rule 
to conduct by principle. The child does not sense the 
principle underlying a type of conduct, but he does 
understand and readily conform to rules. His stage 
of development requires the prescription of ‘‘thou 
shalts’’ and ‘‘thou shalt nots.’? The adolescent re- 
bels against specific regulations, but readily assents 
to principles as guides of conduct and willingly ac- 
cepts their logical application to himself. He rejects 
the letter but holds to the spirit. 
Hero worship seventh characteristic of youth 
is its tendency to form strong personal attachments 
for persons who are thought to embody the ideals to 
which the individual has committed prcsell This 
hero or heroine may be either real or fictitious. 
Around this idealized person gather the dreams and 
visions of youthful aspiration. The hero becomes at 
once both model and sanction. This is a fact of ut- 
most significance. Goethe has said ‘‘We are shaped 
and fashioned by what we love.’’ The character set 
up in the boy’s heart as his personal hero becomes 
the prince of his life, for the admiration with which he 
devotes himself to the hero passes over into love, 
and we truly are shaped and fashioned by the persons 
and the things we love. {Nothing has more signif- 
icance in character education than these personal at- 
tachments, A wise preacher once said, ‘‘Tell me who 
is your son’s prince or princess and I will tell you 
the kind of man your son will become.’’  
-P-A-G-E-451
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 433 
The social instinct—The eighth fact which should be 
emphasized in this connection is the appearance of the 
social instinct, or the ‘‘herd impulse.’ This is more 
commonly referred to as the ‘‘gang instinct.’’ It is 
one of the curious paradoxes of life that during the 
period when the sense of individuality is growing most 
rapidly, when the boy is most sensitive with regard to 
the recognition which he should receive as a person, 
he is seeking to identify himself with a group whose 
guiding principles he is likely to accept for himself 
out of his sense of loyalty to the group, even when 
he does not personally approve of the conduct of the 
group. He must not be thought of as apart from this 
group. Usually he is a little better than the group, 
for group membership involves compromise of per- 
sonal opinion and settlement upon a body of convic- 
tion a little less than any one individual holds for 
himself. The sense of group loyalty of course is ex- 
ceedingly strong, as any teacher knows who has en- 
deavored to detach a pupil from his crowd and secure 
independent action. It was observed above that the 
ethical question always arises in a social situation. 
It is also true that the ethical code is always largely, 
if not wholly, a social affair. The word ‘‘moral’’ 
comes from the Latin, meaning custom, or the prac- 
tice of the group. It is human to accept the practice 
of the majority of one’s group as morally binding, as 
right. A scheme of character education must take 
cognizance of this social character of the code, and 
provide for the reinforcement of individual judgment 
and will by the will of the group. With individuals of 
weaker personality it is ordinarily sufficient to attach
-P-A-G-E-452
  134 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
them definitely to a group of right-living people to 
make sure of their characters as adults. 
Youth is romantic—One other fact deserves presen- 
tation, the fact that the ‘‘teen age’’ is the age of ‘the 
‘‘dreaming of dreams and seeing of visions.’’ Youth 
is romantic. It is not satisfied to rest in the here and 
the now. It yearns to spread its wings and fly to the 
mountain tops. It hungers for the superior. It 
dreams of adventure in which great deeds are done, 
great successes achieved, and the little and mean are 
spurned. Youth prefers the romance of manly living 
to the tame and contemptible meanness of low living, 
if once it breathes the romance of clean living. The 
eagerness of an army of young men for action, with 
supreme indifference to the cost, is not because of the 
lure of battle but because they are young men, ready 
to stake their lives on a cause. It is the romance of 
war that makes a great fighting machine. Young men 
will fight as valiantly in civil life for liberty, justice, 
honor, manliness, if they are let to see the romance in 
personal devotion to such causes. 
What is Character? 
Next in order is the endeavor to set forth an anal- 
ysis of the psychological nature of character which 
may be taken, together with the psychological charac- 
teristics of youth, as a basis for a scheme of instruc- 
tion and discipline looking to the formation of the 
desired ethical life. In this analysis two propositions 
may be accepted:
-P-A-G-E-453
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 435 
1. Character is the sum total of tendencies to be- 
havior in social situations. 
2. Character is grounded in personality. 
Native tendencies—The tendencies to behavior are 
of two kinds: those which are of an instinctive nature, 
and acquired tendencies. The Instinctive Tendencies 
comprise Good Impulses and Bad Impulses. Current 
ethical theory has adopted as the criterion of judg- 
ment the following standards: An Act, Thing or 
Person is Good in the degree to which it contributes 
to the fullness, variety and level (above the brute line) 
of the satisfaction of the seven human wants—the bio- 
logical, economic, intellectual, political, social, play 
and religious. For a very readable discussion of this 
criterion the reader is referred to Coffin’s ‘‘Socialized 
Conscience.’’ For additional discussion of the classifi- 
cation and nature of the seven ‘‘human wants’’ a quite 
satisfactory presentation of the subject will be found 
in Small and Vincent’s ‘‘Introduction to the Study 
of Society’? and Edman’s ‘‘Human Traits.’”’ It is 
pertinent in the present discussion to observe that this 
classification includes every impulse and activity in 
human history. These several wants constitute the 
mainspring of human life. They are the motive 
forces which push man on in his effort to improve his 
condition. They are the causes of civilization. Civ- 
ilization may well be defined as the sum total of those 
agencies, devices, and processes by means of which 
man satisfies his wants. The degree of civilization 
attained is measured by the extent to which he has 
secured the three aspects of satisfaction; namely, full-
-P-A-G-E-454
436 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ness, variety and refinement (level with reference to 
the ‘‘brute line’’). That is, civilization is measured 
by the adequacy, variety, and refinement of the satis- 
faction of the seven above-named wants of human life. 
Human progress may be defined in the same terms, 
and likewise human welfare. Evidently this, also, is 
what Jesus meant by the abundant life. The ethical 
criterion, then, is the degree to which the act, thing, 
or person contributes to the abundance of life—to the 
adequacy, variety, and refinement of family life, or the 
possession of the material necessities of life, of edu- 
cation, of justice, of companionship, of the pleasure 
life, and of spiritual relations. Those things are good 
which contribute to such abundance; those things are 
bad which subtract from such abundance. The good 
is constructive, contributory to human well-being. 
Bad impulses are those which if permitted to function 
will be subtractive, destructive of human well-being. 
Good impulses, obviously, should be nurtured, and the 
bad impulses should be inhibited. Common sense 
joins the best psychology in laying down this principle, 
notwithstanding the dictum of certain well-known 
philosophers. 
Acquired tendencies—The Acquired Tendencies com- 
prise (1) Concepts, (2) Attitudes, and (3) Habits in 
the fields of family, industrial, educational, political, 
social, play and religious activity. A primary law of 
psychology is that, ‘‘Hach state of consciousness tends 
to manifest itself in the corresponding motor re- 
sponse.’’? That is, an idea tends to initiate the cor- 
responding action, and will do so if not inhibited by 
another state of consciousness. A concept of a type 
   
-P-A-G-E-455
  
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 437 
of conduct, therefore, tends to beget such variety of 
conduct. Knowledge of good tends to produce good, 
and will do so unless the impulse is overcome or side- 
tracked by a competing impulse. Knowledge of evil 
has the same tendency. The application of this fact 
to the character of experience which should be per- 
mitted to young people, its application to the theory 
of sophisticating youth, is apparent. It is at least 
true that young people do not engage in evil of which 
they are ignorant. To be sure there is something to 
be said concerning the protection of youth against evil 
by instruction as to its consequences, but even this sort 
of knowledge of sin is poison in itself and must be ac- 
companied by an antidote. 
It is also a primary law that one is instinctively 
drawn to what one likes, to what pleases, and as in- 
stinctively repelled by what one does not like, by what 
displeases. This is fundamental in evaluating the in- 
fluence of the individual’s likes and dislikes upon the 
growth of his character. It largely determines asso- 
ciations and activities, and these, in turn, determine 
habits. Probably no other factor in character-making 
has greater potency in shaping a life, and, if so, the 
presentation of the good in a pleasurable form and of 
evil in its ugly form should constitute a large part of 
the teacher’s program in character education. 
Many have regarded character as synonymous with 
the system of habits which the individual has formed. 
As indicated above, this is not the whole truth, but it 
does constitute a part of character large enough that 
the nature of the habits built up day by day is of great

  438 _ THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Current moral training too narrow—The point of 
emphasis is that these concepts, attitudes, and habits, 
which constitute the acquired tendencies to behavior, 
are not to be limited to such simple virtues as truth- 
telling, honesty, industry, but are to be extended to 
the whole range of life. The real failure of the ethical 
training of the present day is its narrowness. It is 
still confined to those activities which made up the 
simple life of our grandfathers, a simplicity which 
has been outgrown at every point. Seventy years ago 
there were but few forms of theft. Now there are 
many more, and more intangible. Then, theft con- 
sisted principally in taking articles of food and cloth- 
ing. Now it consists in taking all of these and, in ad- 
dition, railroads, coal mines, banks, trust companies, 
factories, ungrown crops, and other articles which 
were unthought of not many years ago. Ethical edu- 
cation, to be truly effective, must help the student to a 
true conception of the facts of life to-day, in all its 
complexity and all of its relationships. The new 
ethics demands a life of active performance rather 
than a life of negations. To be innocent of profanity, 
lying, and other personal vices is good, but not good 
enough. A man might be that good, and yet not good 
for much. The new ethics requires that the individ- 
ual shall be trained in his thinking, his attitudes, and 
his habits for the seven-sided life of to-day. 
Character grounded in personality—The second 
thesis proposes that character is grounded in person- 
ality. Personality is partly native and partly ac- 
quired. By heredity man is (1) Historical, (2) Ra- 
tional, and (3) endowed with certain Inherent Rights
-P-A-G-E-457
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 439 
and their corresponding Obligations. The character- 
istic of historicalness means that man is born with 
the ability to conceive and profit by his own experience 
and the experience of others reaching back to the be- 
ginning of human history, and that he may throw the 
light of this experience upon his personal problems or 
those of his contemporaries. Man is a rational being 
in the sense that he may organize his knowledge into 
a system of laws or principles which become working 
rules for his guidance in planning his activities. He 
may also, through the use of constructive imagination, 
project his life into the future, even to the end of time. 
Obviously, his personality will be proportionate to the 
degree to which he utilizes his historical ability and is 
truly rational. One man may utilize practically noth- 
ing of his own experience or that of others. A second 
man may utilize his own but no more; a third may 
bring to his service the experience of the community, 
while others will utilize more and more, until now and 
then will be found individuals who command the sery- 
ice of the entire known past. Clearly the latter are 
far larger persons than those who utilize less of their 
opportunity. Similarly, men vary in the extent to 
which they elaborate a system of governing principles, 
and also to the extent they live into the future. One 
may readily conceive a series of men, the first of whom 
lives from day to day with no working program be- 
yond the satisfaction of his daily needs, the tramp. 
The second plans his life a few weeks ahead, the third 
a few years, the fourth his lifetime, the fifth has a 
working program which embraces the concerns of his 
great grandchildren, the sixth has working plans 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  440 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which reach into the next century. The first is a 
tramp, the last is a statesman. The figure can be 
changed slightly to include the man who has planned 
his life not only throughout his earthly career, but 
through all time. Human personality varies with his- 
toricalness and rationality. 
Sense of rights and obligations—We Americans 
believe that the individual is born with certain inalien- 
able rights which he instinctively asserts, regardless 
of the accidents of birth and circumstance. If we 
face the facts of life, we recognize also that for each 
of these inalienable rights there is an inescapable ob- 
ligation. For each thing due us, there is a debt to be 
paid. We also recognize that the individual may se- 
cure his rights only as his obligations are met by him- 
self or by others for him, and that he may meet his 
obligations to the extent only that he is granted his 
natural rights. The degree of insistence upon these 
rights and obligations varies with individuals, and 
manifestly again, personality varies with the strength 
of the man’s consciousness of his rights and obliga- 
tions, and his fidelity in securing the former and ob- 
serving the latter. 
Elements of personality—Personality has its native 
and its acquired aspects. On the acquired side, per- 
sonality is the result of the life which the individual is 
living. Life has been called a fabric, which is quali- 
tatively and quantitatively determined. Qualitatively 
it is determined by its warp and woof. The warp con- 
sists of the objectives for which the individual is liv- 
ing, and the principle which he has selected to guide 
him in his éthical judgments. The woof is the experi-
-P-A-G-E-459
  
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 441 
ences which linger in his memory, both his personal 
experiences and those of others which have been com- 
municated to him so effectively as to seem to be his 
own. Among these acquired experiences are the con- 
tent of the literature which he has read. Quantita- 
tively the fabric of life is determined by the individ- 
ual’s physical vigor, the strength of his tendencies to 
action, and the promptness of his reactions. These 
quantitative determinants are largely physical, al- 
though all are to considerable extent subject to train- 
ing. Physical education has a large place in 
character-building, as has been well demonstrated in 
military schools. Increase of physical vigor adds to 
the force of character; increased strength of impulse, 
whether secured through psychological stimulation or 
through the radiation of good health; and the habit of 
promptness of reaction to command or inner sugges- 
tion—all these contribute to strength of character. 
Moral control—An analysis of moral control by 
periods of development reveals the following synthe- ~ 
sis of facts: 
1. In childhood, the control is objectively imposed 
by: (1) Personal Authority of (a) parents, (b) 
teachers, and (c) the state; (2) by the Coercion of 
Group Opinion; and (3) Suggestion and Imitation. 
The control in childhood consists of (1) Concepts of 
proper behavior, (2) Sentiments with regard to dif- 
ferent types of behavior, developed through fixation 
of admiration; (3) Habits, fixed by home and school 
discipline. 
2. In adult life, conduct is subjectively controlled 
by: (1) Concepts of behavior which have been par- 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
    
442 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tially thought out personally, partly accepted from the 
group, and partly inherited from childhood. Adult 
behavior is controlled in the second place (2) by at- 
titudes which have in part grown out of personal ex- 
perience, and in part have been absorbed from group 
affiliations. (3) The third control is the set of habits 
which the individual has formed. 
3. Youth is a period of transition from the controls 
of childhood to the controls of manhood, and is gov- 
erned in part by each type of control, the degree vary- 
ing with the age of the pupil. 
The foregoing may be shown by the following out- 
line:

Tendencies to behavior.

A Suggested Program of Character Education in 
the High School. 
1. Systematic physical training having as its ob- 
jectives the development of good health, of proper 
sitting and standing posture, good carriage in walking, 
and skill in those aquatic, athletic and gymnastic sports 
requiring prompt attack, a high degree of co-ordina- 
tion of mind and body, teamwork, courage, sustained 
effort, and fair play. Athletics conducted strictly in 
a sportsman-like manner have exceedingly high value 
in the development of personality. The reader will 
please recall the suggestions as to character values in 
the numerous references in this volume to supervised 
student activities. A philosopher once said that if 
he were permitted to write the music of a people 
he would not care who wrote their laws; it might 
with even greater propriety be said that if one could 
control the play of youth he need not care who wrote 
their music or their laws. 
2. A vigorous, rich school experience in which the 
pupil is stimulated to a splendid citizenship in his 
routine relationships and activities. The initiative 
called forth in class discussion, the recognition of
-P-A-G-E-463
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 445 
personality in the give and take of the classroom, the 
dignified and thoughtful handling of situations in the 
daily routine which involve ethical problems, the en- 
thusiasm of the student body, ‘‘school spirit,’’ all are 
powerful factors in the making of character and afford 
the best of situations in which a wise teacher may 
make never-to-be-forgotten impressions of manliness. 
It is in no carping spirit that the statement is made 
that one serious weakness of much high school ed- 
ucation is the prevailing ‘‘smallness’’ of it. The in. 
tercourse of teacher and pupil is on the low level of 
the drill sergeant and raw recruit. The atmosphere 
is one of small faultfinding, fussiness. Too rarely 
do the teacher and his students get on a high-minded 
‘‘man to man’? level of intercourse. In this part of 
the program, also, it is recommended that the high 
school make much of ‘‘student activities’? as a means 
of character building. At the best, the classroom re- 
lation involves the subordination of the student to 
the teacher. Real democracy in the recitation is a 
dream which is not often realized. Dramatics, the 
orchestra, the literary club, the debating society, and 
similar organizations afford splendid facilities for ex- 
ercise of student initiative and responsibility. These 
activities are not merely ‘‘safety valves’’ for using 
up surplus energy and thereby preventing disorderly 
outbreaks. They are legitimate functions of the 
school, and should be as carefully planned and vigor- 
ously conducted as are other activities. 
3. A course of instruction, comprising daily lessons 
throughout, a semester, in addition to ‘‘morning exer- 
cise’’ talks and special lectures, in which the objective
-P-A-G-E-464
446 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
is the development of concepts of the fundamental 
principles which should govern behavior. These 
principles should relate to manners as well as morals. 
This course should not be a study of formal ethics. 
Rather, it should comprise an examination of the 
functions of the several social institutions, their 
necessity to the existence of human life, the nature 
of civilization, and of the factors which contribute to 
its growth, the results which would ensue if any of 
these factors were destroyed or its efficiency reduced. 
Such a course would undertake to portray the service 
which bank, railroad, church, school, government, the 
park system, capital, labor, producer, consumer, ren- 
der to society, the degree of necessity of each to the 
others and to the community as a whole. It would be 
a course primarily in social values and relationships 
which would give the pupil data for arriving at his 
personal convictions. The course may be described 
as a study of social ethics. The proper text for such 
a course has not yet been published. The nearest in 
substance and spirit is Coffin’s ‘‘Socialized Con- 
science. ’? 
4, Cultivation of right feelings and attitudes by 
attaching the pupil through stimulating his admira- 
tion to wholesome personalities in the community; in 
the state; in the nation; in history; in literature; in 
the Bible. The potency of hero worship we all recog- 
nize. The hero is created for the individual pupil by 
fixing his admiration upon a man or woman of out- 
standing character. In any community thee are men 
and women who are eminently worthy of ¢dmiration 
and imitation, just as there are in state and nation.
-P-A-G-E-465
  MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 447 
We have found and utilized the value in attaching 
the youth of our land to Washington, Lincoln, Grant, 
McKinley and Roosevelt. This is precisely the thing 
here recommended; with this addition, that in the 
community of which the school is a part are men and 
women of as lofty character, as fine citizenship, and 
as great usefulness in their respective capacities as 
are our national heroes, and it is essential to a truly 
moral chacter that one possess the ability to recognize 
true worth in lowly situations as well as in exalted 
positions. There is no sufficient reason why a prophet 
should not receive due honor in Nazareth. The con- 
tent of history and literature lends itself particularly 
to this phase of moral education. Much may and 
should be made of biography, and because of its 
special value in character-development, biography 
should be taught for appreciation. It is unnecessary 
to say that the one great source of spiritual nurture 
is the Bible, the source of the intellectual vigor and 
moral strength of the Lincolns and Roosevelts who in 
no small sense have been successors in the prophetic 
line, and that the one personality in all human history 
truly most admirable and worthy of imitation is the 
central figure in the scriptures. The only infallible 
rule for character-development is in the commandment 
to love God with all of one’s being and the neighbor as 
one’s self, remembering that God is known through 
Jesus Christ and that in loving the neighbor we have 
learned to love and serve the Chris! 
The second means of cultivating right feelings and 
attitudes is through control of the pupil’s social sit- 
wations in school and out of school. The youth as well
-P-A-G-E-466
  448 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as the child is peculiarly susceptible to the suggestions 
emanating from his associations. The kind of people 
who constitute his intimates will more or less per- 
meate his mind and heart with their feelings, biases, 
and evaluations. There is a certain element of the 
chameleon in human nature which makes it readily 
take on the color of its environment. This is also true 
of the physical as well as the personal associations. 
The educative significance, in relation to the nurture 
of the affections, of street signs, advertising boards, 
and property conditions, is extremely large. Besides, 
there is a system of pleasure life in most communities, 
of questionable character, which requires regulation 
by educational authorities, either those of the school 
or of the community at large. This function is per- 
formed to some extent by the Young Men’s Christian 
Association, by the Scout organization, by church 
societies, and similar agencies. But everywhere there 
is a large population of young high school boys and 
girls, unprotected and undirected in the great ‘‘school- 
out-of-school,’? who sorely need such protection and 
direction of their social relations and activities. 
5. The developing of right habits through a wise, 
steady, vigorous school discipline in connection with 
a proper home discipline, to be secured in part at least 
through the medium of parent-teachers associations, 
and also by sensible regulation of student activities. 
Four things the high school may do in religious educa- 
tion—In the matter of religious education there are 
at least four things which the high school may do with- 
out trespassing or exceeding its proper and legal func- 
tions. [First of all, the school administration may de-
-P-A-G-E-467
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 449 
cline to employ any teacher who is not loyal to the faith 
which furnishes the sanctions upon which the liberties 
and the rights of the American people rest.) The state 
may require that the men and women who go before 
the youth of the community as representative of those 
things which make for manhood, shall be right at 
heart as well as in their academic attainments. | The 
second thing which the high school may do is to give 
God his rightful recognition in the background of 
instruction.| It is worth much if a place can be found 
in the daily program for a period of devotional serv- 
ice, but this is not so important as that the “logical 
universe’’ within which instruction is organized shall 
be definitely pro-God. The fear of the Lord has 
always been the beginning of real wisdom, and is so in 
high school education as elsewhere. In many states, 
what is known as the North Dakota plan of Bible study 
has been adopted with quite satisfactory results. 
Obviously, and wholly aside-from its value in the 
nurture of the spiritual tof note of the Bible 
is necessary as a preparation for the learning of his- 
tory and al tis al interpretation, and the apprecia- 
tion of art. ¥ It is also necessary to an intelligent grasp 
of the common law which lies at the basis of our 
political system. It would seem but a matter of sen- 
sible procedure to make the study of the English Bible 
a large factor in the educational scheme. [In all that 
is said here it is understood that there is no place 
whatever in the public school for denominationalism, 
nor for the presentation of_a system of theology. | 
These belong to the church.| However, religion and 
spiritual law belong to life, to the school as much as
-P-A-G-E-468
    450 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to the church. | (The fourth thing which the high school 
may do is to give its endorsement to the church and to 
all religious agencies and activities, and encourage its 
students to full participation therein. | 
Summary 
Personal character is the ultimate directive force 
in human life, and obviously a program of education 
which looks to making the individual truly efficient 
for himself, and for society, must provide for training 
in fundamental morality. 
In view of the fact that religion supplies both the 
inspiration and sanctions of private and public mo- 
rality, the school cannot divest itself completely of all 
concern for the spiritual nurture of the youth of the 
nation. 
In view of the failure of the home and church to 
reach the majority of the population with any system- 
atic instruction in the moral and religious sanctions 
upon which our democratic institutions rest, and the 
marvelous growth of the public high school as the 
most influential institution with all classes of people, 
the secondary program incurs the obligation to make 
suitable provision for securing the needed moral and 
spiritual training. 
It is not un-American for the public school to teach 
religion. The principles of ‘‘separation of church and 
state’’ refer to control and financial support, and do 
not mean that the American state shall not consciously 
rest itself in a definite religious faith. It was not the 
thought of the founders of the nation and its pub-
-P-A-G-E-469
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 451 
lic schools that public education should be agnostic. 
The problem of religious education belongs pecul- 
iarly to the high school period because of the nature of 
religion and the psychology of youth. 
Character is the sum-total of tendencies to behavior 
in social situations. It is grounded in personality. 
Tendencies to behavior are (1) instinctive, comprising 
good and bad impulses, and (2) acquired. Those im- 
pulses are good that contribute to fullness, variety, 
and refinement in the satisfaction of the seven va- 
rieties of human wants; other impulses are bad. The 
acquired tendencies comprise: (1) concepts, (2) atti- 
tudes and (3) habits, in the fields of family, industrial, 
political, social, play and religious activity. Again, 
the nature of the contribution to the general welfare 
is the test of goodness. 
Current moral training is too narrow for the reason 
that the complexity of the social situation has out- 
grown the categories of the old morality. 
Personality has its native and acquired aspects. 
With respect to the acquired factors, personality is 
the result of the life the individual is living, and to 
this extent is subject to education. 
The program of character-education may comprise 
the following elements: (1) systematic training for 
health and co-ordination of mind and body; (2) a 
vigorous and rich school experience stimulating the 
pupil to good citizenship in his routine relationships 
and activities; (3) a course of instruction in the funda- 
mental principles of conduct; (4) stimulation of 
admiration for wholesome personalities in the com- 
munity, the state, the nation, in history, in literature,
-P-A-G-E-470
  452 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL S7JPJECTS 
in the Bible; (5) inculcation of the love of God and 
the neighbor. 
Four things the high school may do in religious 
education: (1) decline to employ any teacher who is 
not loyal to the faith which furnishes the sanctions 
upon which the liberties and the rights of the Ameri- 
can people rest; (2) give God His rightful place in the 
background of instruction; (3) it can in most states 
provide instruction in the Bible; (4) it can give its 
endorsement to the church and to all religious agencies 
and activities, and encourage its students to full 
participation therein.

  CHAPTER XXII 
TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 
Making the pupil a student—In general, there are 
two objects to be accomplished in the course of in- 
struction: First is the immediate acquisition of 
Knowledge, Attitude and Skill or Habit, which have 
been kept in view throughout the volume as teaching 
objectives; the second object is the training of the 
student in the methods of acquiring information for 
himself. It is the purpose to make the pupil inde- 
pendent of the school and its ministrations as fully and 
as early as possible. The sooner he develops a 
definite aspiration in the direction of larger knowledge 
and ability, together with skill in finding his own way, 
the more effectively may the school perform its office. 
As between inspiration and information, the former 
is worth far more in the long run, and as between the 
immediate results of the school process and the de- 
velopment of ability in the pupil to work for himself 
without the aid of the teacher, the latter is much more 
valuable. The proper ambition of the teacher is to 
equip his pupils with definite aspirations for knowl- 
edge, and the ability to secure it for themselves. He 
realizes that at the most his course can but open up 
the subject in a very elementary way. He cannot 
present more than the fundamental facts and prin- 
ciples. His instruction will be far from securing the 
454 
 
-P-A-G-E-473
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 455 
mastery which the pupil needs. The educational 
process needs to go on indefinitely. In order that it 
may do so, and in the right direction, his ultimate 
concern is that the pupil develop such depth of inter- 
est that he will not rest satisfied with the small attain- 
ment of the classroom, and gain such habits of study 
that he may continue to work for himself effectively. 
It should be repeated that the larger service of the 
school is to train its pupils in methods of study which 
will make them independent of the teacher’s help, and 
then give them an adequate motivation. 
Principle of self-activity—The wise teacher keeps in 
mind the fact that intellectual growth, like physical 
growth, is secured by the self-activity of the individual. 
The corn plant must do its own growing; the farmer 
may manipulate the conditions of growth, prepare the 
soil, let in the sunlight, provide moisture, and remove 
the competition of other plants, but the plant itself 
must take up the food materials, perform the necessary 
chemical changes, distribute them to the various parts 
of the plant, put out its own foliage and send its roots 
down into the earth. It must be active. The teacher 
cannot eat his pupil’s breakfast, digest and assimilate 
it for him. Nor should he ‘‘carry the ball’’ in the 
classroom. <A college student once said of his math- 
ematics teacher: ‘‘He knows the subject, and he knows 
how to explain its difficulties, but he carries the ball 
all the time himself and keeps us on the bleachers.’’ 
This is a very good description of what goes on too 
generally in the classroom. The pupils are kept on 
the bleachers. Many teachers have a mistaken view 
of the relative importance of school exercises. They   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-474
  
  456 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
suppose the daily recitation is the event of primary 
importance. The fact is that the study period is the 
vital exercise, for in it the pupil is most self-active. 
The business of the recitation period is to direct the 
activity of the study period; to motivate the pupil for 
it, to formulate the problem to be solved, to give 
necessary instruction as to mode of procedure and 
sources of material, and to check and supplement the 
pupil’s results the following day. It will work a de- 
sirable revolution in school methods and results if 
teachers will organize their courses in such manner 
that the recitation will seek to promote the study ex- 
ercise, rather than to make the study period a prep- 
aration for the recitation. Teachers should be judged 
by the work of their pupils in the study period, not 
by their own facility in the recitation. This suggestion 
is offered to supervisors as a plan for greatly improv- 
ing teaching methods in their schools. The working 
principle is, The object of the teaching process is ta 
beget and direct the learning process; it is the latter 
which secures growth. 
The art of learning—There is an art of learning, and 
an art of teaching. The latter exists to secure the for- 
mer, and its processes are determined by it. The 
real methods problem is how the pupil may learn his 
lesson, and what shall the teacher do to stimulate the 
pupil to go through the necessary process. Most 
normal schools are at fault in this particular. They 
train the prospective teacher to set her attention upon 
her own performance instead of the performance of 
the pupil. Educational science recognizes the pri- 
macy of the principle of self-activity, but the training
-P-A-G-E-475
    
TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 457 
school does not consistently apply it in the preparation 
of teachers. es 
The art of study not native—The pupil must acquire 
the art of study. That is, he is not born with it. He 
comes into the world with a very active curiosity, in- 
satiable, diffuse, indiscriminate as to values. He 
must learn to control his attention, and he must be 
subjected to a long and vigorous discipline in induc- 
tive and deductive processes, in methods of attack, 
of record. The teacher cannot expect her pupils to 
come to her equipped for the technical processes of 
formal study. Children are born with the machinery 
for study and with the disposition to study, just as a 
colt out of racing stock is born with the machinery 
and disposition for racing. However, the colt re- 
quires an infinite amount of training before he is ready 
for his first race. 
Methods of study general and special—Methods of 
study are (1) general and (2) special. That is, 
there are certain conditions and processes which oc- 
cur in all study exercises, and also there are certain 
processes necessary in each study and peculiar to it. 
The pupil sets about learning a lesson in geometry in 
some respects in the same way in which he learns a 
lesson in history; but there is, besides, a mode of at- 
tack and a thought-curve in geometry which do not 
occur in history. There is one way of learning a ge- 
ometry lesson and another for learning the lesson in 
algebra, a general method for all mathematics and a 
special method for each mathematical study. The 
learning process in plane geometry is not entirely the 
same as that of solid geometry. The teacher must re-
-P-A-G-E-476
458 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
member this fact in transferring her class from one 
subject to the other. She must introduce them to the 
new method as well as to the new subject matter. In 
passing from elementary Latin to Cexsar the pupils are 
confronted with a new learning process in which they 
must be instructed and trained if they are to succeed. 
A successful Latin teacher was in the habit of taking 
the first two or three weeks of the term to induct her 
class into ‘‘the art of reading Cesar.’’ She spent all 
of the allotted time during this period in studying with 
her pupils, showing them how she proceeded in the 
preparation of an assignment, how to use the vocabu- 
lary, the grammar, how to attack the sentence, where 
to take hold and how to make fast. She was an adept 
in the art of common sense. Her pupils were enthus- 
iastic, always prepared, because they knew how to pre- 
pare her lessons, and their accomplishment in quality 
and quantity always exceeded the work done under 
other teachers. It should be said in passing that stu- 
dent ability for a particular study is largely a matter 
of knowing how to study the subject.. A very good 
teacher of mathematics received a class which was 
ready to take up the study of simultaneous equations 
and which had been given a very high rating by their 
former teacher in the first part of the course. They 
were wholly disappointing to themselves and to the 
new teacher. After some three or four weeks of dis- 
couraging effort the teacher applied for advice. He 
was asked whether these pupils had been trained for 
the new phase of the subject. His idea was that they 
knew intuitively how to proceed, but he agreed to take 
ten periods in training them for getting the new les-
-P-A-G-E-477
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 459 
sons. At the end of the time he reported with great 
enthusiasm that his class was now doing well, the 
best class he had ever had. A second-year girl was 
reported as incapable of learning history, and the fact 
was brought out that she had required two years for 
each of the grades, being in each case promoted ew 
gratia in history. The teacher was asked whether the 
girl knew how to study a history lesson. Investiga- 
tion disclosed that she was faithful in application, ex- 
ceedingly conscientious about her work, and devoted 
sufficient time to accomplish her assignments. It was 
also disclosed that her teachers regarded her as dull 
in history while exhibiting fair ability in other studies. 
The girl also had been led to feel that she was men- 
tally inferior. The teacher was asked to take her for 
his conference period for ten days and show her how 
he proceeded in attacking history lessons, and advised 
to go about it in the fashion of a good Samaritan. At 
the end of the period he reported that he was satisfied 
with her native ability and that he had discovered she 
had gone through these several years of history work 
without ‘‘getting the hang of history study.”’ He 
gave her the ‘‘hang”’ of it and the young lady finished 
the course with the best half of the class. It is need- 
less to remind the reader of the crime against children 
of charging up as a matter of the child’s ineptitude, 
the teacher’s failure to induct the pupil into the art 
of study. If the individual can count ten, conceive a 
bit of indicated space, understand a ratio, and wants 
to learn, he has all of the psychological equipment for 
the learning of mathematics—all that the greatest 
mathematician ever had. If he can give an accurate  
-P-A-G-E-478
  460 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
account of the events of the morning in proper se- 
quence, can keep his account true to the sequence of 
incidents, can draw proper inference from bits of evi- 
dence, he possesses all the mental machinery for the 
mastery of history. All that he needs in addition is 
adequate motive, apperceptive material, and the 
‘thang’’ of the reading of history. These additional 
things that he needs are not hereditary; supplying 
them is the business of the teacher. Studies are tools 
the use of which the pupil must learn, and each tool 
has its own peculiar handling which requires special 
training. 
The will to learn—It was suggested above that the 
purpose of the recitation with reference to a new les- 
son is two-fold: first, to motivate the pupil for the 
lesson; and second, to give him the needed directions 
as to procedure and sources of material. Let us again 
emphasize the importance of arousing in the pupil such 
desire for the new information or accomplishment that 
he will attack the assignment with vigor. Dr. Jordan 
used to say that ‘‘when a man makes up his mind 
where he wants to go he is half way there.’’? Stimu- 
lating the pupil to want something with all his heart 
is more than half the battle. Once a boy wants to 
know geometry, as did Abraham Lincoln, he will get 
it without a teacher. After all most of the waste mo- 
tion in school is due to the fact that the pupils have 
not been awakened to a working interest in the subject 
pursued. They have not been made to ‘‘want’’ the 
new thing. ‘‘Morale won the war.’’ Morale in the 
sense of a real zeal for their studies will make students 
efficient. Usually the individual gets what he wants.
-P-A-G-E-479
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 461 
«Ask and ye shall receive; knock and it shall be opened 
unto you.’’ This is the first principle also of student 
efficiency. 
General survey and critical study—In general study, 
two processes are involved: first, a general survey of 
the lesson, noting its outstanding features and parts; 
second, critical study of each part and feature. In the 
chapter on teaching English classics these processes 
were illustrated. In the general survey of the assign- 
ment, the class was directed to read the selection 
through, get the story as a whole, master the vocabu- 
lary, the figurative expressions, getting the general 
acquaintance with the selection as a whole which must 
be in mind in order to take up the critical study of 
particular features and divisions in their proper re- 
lation to the whole. After this general study has been 
completed, the class then takes up such special features 
as plot, characters, style, diction, historical setting, 
likeness to other selections, the characteristics of the 
author, memory passages. 
In learning the proof of the equality of two triangles 
the procedure would be the same. First, the pupil ad- 
dresses himself to the proposition as a whole, getting 
the conditions set forth, the relation to be proved, and 
the relation of the new problem to his general field of 
knowledge. Second, he divides his problem into its 
constituent parts, thinks out each step in order, and 
then synthesizes the whole into a logical argument. 
If the lesson assignment is the Great War, the first 
step will be the general survey, getting in mind the 
time and place of the war, the causes in a general way, 
the participants, the more important campaigns, and
-P-A-G-E-480
  462 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the final outcome. Having established such land- 
marks of thought the pupil is then to take, one after 
the other, special features of the war and think each 
in relation to the war as a whole. These special 
topics may comprise particular campaigns, the accumu- 
lation of causes differentiated as ethical, economic, 
religious, geographic, ethnic, leading personages, the 
financial aspect of the war, the aspect of army build- 
ing, development of military equipment, and different 
branches of service, in detail. 
The following scheme for the exhaustive study of a 
topic, large or small, is derived by application of the 
principles of logical relations, and with proper modi- 
fication as to emphasis and sequence, is readily avail- 
able in any high school subject. Every fact and rela- 
tion which can be involved in a situation finds a place 
in this scheme. 
Scheme for Study 
I. Study all of the characteristics which may be 
apprehended through Sense Perception: 
1. Through Vision, as; Color, shape, size, dis- 
tance, ete. 
2. Through Hearing; Sounds, noises, tones, ete. 
3. Through Smell; Odors. 
4. Through Taste; Flavors. 
5. Through Touch; Smoothness, roughness, 
temperature. 
6. Through Muscular Resistance; Weight, 
strength, hardness, softness, etc.
-P-A-G-E-481
    
TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 463 
II. Relations: 
1. Contiguity in time and place. 
2. Similarity and contrast. 
3. Whole and part. 
4. Cause and effect relations. 
5. The noetic relations. 
The use of this scheme may be illustrated in the 
study of a tree, a maple for instance. The first divi- 
sion of the study will be directed to the characteristics 
of the maple observed through direct sense-perception. 
A typical tree should be taken. The pupils proceed to 
discover the shape and size of the adult tree, the color 
of foliage, of bark, of woody fiber. Second, they note 
odor of foliage, root, bark, wood; third, the flavors of 
the several parts; fourth, roughness of bark, texture 
of wood, the surface of the unpolished wood, of the 
polished wood, etc.; fifth, hardness of wood, tensile 
strength, weight, flexibility, ete. There will be no 
sound characters to consider. Second, the pupils in- 
vestigate the relations of the tree to other trees, to 
its environment, and to the pupil: Under the first 
head, they will investigate the distribution of the 
maple, time of seeding, germination, growth, etc., the 
age of the maple. Under the second head, they will 
consider the likenesses and differences of the maple in 
comparison with other trees, determining its place in 
the plant system. The third relation involves the 
structure of the tree, its anatomy, as usually presented 
. the botany text. The fourth relation leads to the 
study of the growth of the tree from the seed, its food, 
its processes of nutrition, the various conditions affect-
-P-A-G-E-482
  464 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing its growth; and of the uses of the tree; economic, 
esthetic, ete. The noetic relations will be confined to 
the individual pupils who may have had a peculiar ex- 
perience involving the maple tree. 
Modifying the scheme—Other illustrations have been 
given in preceding chapters. The sequence will vary 
with the nature of the topic, and the emphasis will 
depend upon the extent of former study, the relevancy 
of the particular topic to the lesson as a whole, the 
time available. Any scheme for study must be ap- 
plied with common sense. The preceding aspects of 
any subject under study must be brought out in some 
order and in proper proportion. Otherwise, the 
teacher should employ the approach which ‘‘works’’ 
most readily for him. The important thing is that the 
teacher give the pupil a definite mode of attack, which 
will set him going, direct his progress systematically, 
and provide him with a means of determining for 
himself whether he has completed his study. Any 
scheme must possess these three characteristics; it 
must give initiative, direct the advance along progres- 
sive lines and afford a means of knowing when the 
task is completed. 
The lesson assignment—The character of the lesson 
assignment is an important factor in directing the 
study process. The assignment may take different 
forms, depending upon the stage of study and the age 
of the pupils. It may be in the form of topics or 
themes set for study, of questions, the answer to which 
will require the pupil to go through the learning proc- 
ess desired, or it may be in the form of a certain 
quantity of text which the pupil must master. For
-P-A-G-E-483
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 465 
advanced students, and for those who are covering 
familiar ground and have acquired a method of study, 
the topical assignment will be satisfactory. If the 
pupil is in the fact-gathering stage of the lesson and 
the text contains the information which he needs to 
acquire, the text assignment is entirely proper. Or- 
dinarily the question form of assignment is most 
effective with students of all ages and grades of ad- 
vancement. This is for the reason that it contains 
within itself the necessary motivation, and states 
definitely the thing to be accomplished. A good lesson 
assignment should perform the following services: 
(1) state definitely the thing to be accomplished in a 
way which moves the pupil to make the effort of ac- 
complishment; (2) indicate, if not already known, how 
the pupil should proceed to find the solution; and 
(3) cite the available resources for materials necessary 
in the solution. The thing to be accomplished is most 
effectively stated in the question form. There are 
two reasons. First, it avoids the appearance of com- 
mand, which tends to stir up mental opposition. 
Second, as Judd points out in his ‘‘ Psychology of High 
School Subjects,’’ we study when we feel the need of 
adjustment to a situation. The mind goes out in- 
stinctively in search of adjustment. It strives to 
come to rest. The existence of an unanswered ques- 
tion, or of an unsolved problem, involves the absence 
of adjustment. The question form of assignment has 
the further value of being definite. The pupil may 
know what is wanted, and when he has satisfied the 
requirement. This form of assignment, therefore, 
meets the first and second conditions. In connection 
 
-P-A-G-E-484
  466 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
with the question, or other statement of the accom- 
plishment demanded, the assignment should make sure 
that the pupil takes up his work with a plan for its ac- 
complishment. The extent to which directions for 
learning the lesson shall be included in the assignment 
will depend upon the advancement of the pupil and 
the phase of the lesson under study. The principle 
is that the pupil shall know definitely enough how to 
set about the study, to enable him to do what is ex- 
pected of him. If, as sometimes happens, the teacher 
desires that he work out a method of attack for him- 
self, the discovery or invention of such plan should 
constitute the goal of the assignment, and the content 
of the lesson will take a subordinate place, becoming 
material to be employed in elaborating the method. 
Lastly, the pupil should have sufficient direction as to 
sources of material when he begins his study, to enable 
him to proceed without waste of time and energy. 
This last condition may be met by giving the class 
special training in the use of reference books such 
as dictionaries, encyclopedias, atlases, source-books. 
This training will include the use of the card index, 
the book index, maps, charts, graphs, cross-references, 
book reviews, chapter and book summaries, and a 
knowledge of the contents of dictionaries and ency- 
clopedias. A few days of intensive training in the use 
of such material will greatly increase the effectiveness 
of class work. 
“Questioning the book” —If reading assignments are 
made, that is, sections of the text are assigned for 
study, the pupil may be trained with advantage to 
‘question the book.’’: He really questions himself  
-P-A-G-E-485
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 467 
over the content of the assignment, taking the réles of 
both teacher and pupil. Thus, if the assignment is a 
section of the geography text relating to Greenland, 
the pupil may be trained to begin by asking himself 
what the lesson for the day is about. This requires 
the reading of the lesson as a whole to answer. Hav- 
ing ascertained that much, he then asks himself ‘‘ What 
different things does the book tell about Greenland?’’ 
He rereads and decides that the text tells about sur- 
face, climate, people, and their industries. He asks 
next, ‘‘What does the book tell us about the surface?’’ 
““What does it tell us about the climate?’’ So he pro- 
ceeds to the end, finally organizing the lesson content 
by saying to himself, ‘‘The lesson tells about four 
things, surface, climate, ete. It tells three things 
about surface, namely, ete.’? This practice, which, by 
the way, is feasible in the intermediate and grammar 
grades as well as with more advanced students, has 
several advantages. First, it gives the pupil a definite 
mode of procedure. Second, it is effective in fixing 
the content in mind. Third, and of most importance, 
it puts the pupil in an active attitude toward the as- 
signment. He works on the material of the assign- 
ment, as material; he attacks, aggressively and with a 
plan; he is not left to the dubious chance of ‘‘absorb- 
gee! the content by formless reading of it. 
Supervised study—Since study of the lesson is the 
dynamic center of the instruction process, and the ac- 
quiring of proper habits of study the best value the 
individual receives, it is obvious that the study exercise 
demands the most careful attention of the teacher. 
Such attention is possible only under the plan, fertu-
-P-A-G-E-486
468 THE TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
nately becoming more general, of ‘‘supervised study.”’ 
It is unnecessary to occupy time in this connection with 
a discussion of supervision of the study period. The 
chapter has been pointing to the conclusion that the 
daily schedule of exercises should be built around 
the study period as the activity of primary impor- 
tance, the time, nature, and frequency of the recitation 
being determined by the needs arising in the study 
exercise. The recitation thus becomes a species of 
business meeting for conference as to progress in the 
real work of the class, which is being done individually 
in the study room, and for creating the social situation 
which will yield the necessary motivation. More and 
more, the school should take the form of a place where 
pupils study and experiment and debate, rather than a 
place where they go to recite lessons. 
Summary 
The real teacher strives to make his pupil independ- 
ent. To accomplish this he aims to motivate the pupil 
with an impelling interest in the subject, and to train 
in the methods of attack peculiar to the subject. For 
this reason, he is vitally concerned with the problems 
of motivation and of training the pupil in the art of 
study. 
He is the best teacher who succeeds in making him- 
self unnecessary to the pupil, and the best school is that 
in which the pupil does the most for himself. 
The real methods problem is how the pupil shall 
proceed to learn the lesson, and the stimulations 
thereto which the téacher may employ.
-P-A-G-E-487
  TRAINING THE HIGH SCHOOL PUPIL TO STUDY 469 
The art of study is not native; the pupil must ac- 
quire it. 
Methods of study are (1) general and (2) special. 
There are certain conditions and processes which oc- 
cur in all study exercises, and besides these there are 
certain processes peculiar to each study. This re- 
quires that each teacher shall hold himself responsible 
for training his pupils in his particular subject. 
“Morale won the war.’’ Morale in the sense of the 
‘will to learn,’’ a real zeal for studies, will make a 
student efficient. 
In general study, two processes are involved: (1) a 
survey of the lesson as a whole; (2) critical study of 
each part and feature. These processes are illustrated 
in the plan for the study of English classics given in 
Chapter V. The same plan is embodied in the scheme 
for study included in the present chapter. 
The lesson assignment should contain directions for 
study in the case of immature pupils. The form the 
assignment takes will depend upon the stage of their 
progress in the subject. 
“Questioning the book’’ is a profitable practice to 
establish. It insures a definite attack upon the lesson. 
The aim of this chapter is to point to the conclusion 
that the study period is the center around which the 
exercises of the class should be planned, and that the 
recitation should be devoted primarily to preparing 
for an effective use of the study period. This implies 
that supervision of study is the teacher’s primary 
business, the character and extent of the direction 
given the pupils being determined by the degree of ef- 
fective independence they have achieved.

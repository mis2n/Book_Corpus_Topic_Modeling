  PREFACE 
Tuis Manual comprises a series of experiments that can be 
performed by untrained students of psychology without supple- 
mentary explanation on the part of the teacher and without 
costly and complicated apparatus. 
The selection of the experiments was made chiefly with 
reference to their relative simplicity and ease of execution by 
classes of beginners in the study of psychology, but in part 
also with reference to their importance as illustrations of the 
phenomena and processes of mental life. 
The experiments thus selected have been arranged in the 
order best suited logically to present a consistent outline of 
psychology and best adapted pedagogically to develop such an 
outline in the minds of students first approaching the study 
of mental phenomena from the viewpoint of the psychologist. 
Where compromise seemed necessary, pedagogical motives have 
generally outweighed purely scientific considerations. For ex- 
ample, the sensation which for psychology is a simple element 
is by no means the simplest and most familiar mental experience. 
To present the sensation as an object of study before other more 
important and better known processes have been examined by 
the student would seem as unsound pedagogically as it would 
be to begin the study of human physiology with a microscopic 
examination of the cells of the body. 
The scope of the Manual has been purposely restricted to 
the analysis of the component processes of mental phenomena. 
The course of the analysis successively presents the essential 
features of apperception, perception, attention, the range and 
limits of consciousness, the association of mental contents and 
VSO. Ae

of physiological and physical processes, the relation of mental 
contents to these processes, and the sensation as the mental 
element. Problems peculiarly connected with the processes of 
mental synthesis and with physiological psychology have conse- 
quently been denied special consideration, although they are 
frequently mentioned where necessary for the explanation of 
the subject-matter germane to the scope of the book. 
The experiments are not intended primarily to constitute 
a manual of experimental psychology. Their purpose is to 
illustrate the facts and principles of psychology by leading the 
student, whether a beginner or an advanced student, to dis- 
cover for himself the psychological facts upon which are based 
the principles of the science. The formation of correct habits of 
inductive reasoning, through training in psychological methods 
of thought, is of no small importance to any student; it is indis- 
pensable to students of pedagogy in normal schools, who require 
not only a knowledge of the fundamental principles of psy- 
chology, but also some training in independence of thought and 
action, before entering upon the more extended field of psy- 
chological experimentation in the schoolroom. This Manual 
can render no more gratifying service than that of diverting 
those who are destined to become teachers from an unwhole- 
some subservience to psychological and pedagogical authorities 
toward a confident self-dependence upon their own powers of 
observation and reflection. The exercise of sound judgment in 
dealing with psychological facts is essential to any measure of 
success in teaching, whether such success proceed from a “nat- 
ural tact”’ or “gift,” or from the intelligent employment of the 
acquired facts and methods of pedagogy and psychology. 
On superficial examination, the Manual may appear to lack 
those helps to memory and condensation — catchy definitions. 
A definition is often necessarily couched in such brief terms as 
to fail adequately to represent the ideas which it is intended to 
summarize. Too frequently, also, the definition is treated by 
  cay
-P-A-G-E-5

the student as an explanation conveying information not known 
before. For example, if a student learns that “to attend is to 
concentrate the mind upon an object,” he has no additional infor- 
mation regarding the thing defined, viz., attention. If he rests 
satisfied with such definitions as this, he is storing his mind with 
material that will remain forever unassimilated. Memorized 
definitions of this sort can aid the student no further than to 
enable him to make a specious show of information before 
examining boards whose questions fail to test his real and 
vital knowledge. 
But the definition is too important an aid to the memory 
in holding together facts already known to have been over- 
looked in the preparation of this Manual. The experiments 
have been arranged to give a consistent and progressive develop- 
ment of the subject-matter of the several chapters. The titles 
of these experiments, which are carefully worded to indicate 
their purport, serve the purpose of an outline of the chapters. 
After most of the experiments, viz., wherever the importance 
of the experiment seemed to warrant it, a discussion of the 
subject-matter of the experiment follows, in which are given 
many descriptive definitions. In the preparation of this descrip- 
tive and explanatory text, I have spared no labor to attain 
simplicity and clearness of expression. Portions of the Manual 
may, nevertheless, be difficult of comprehension to some. While 
a greater ability in the expression of scientific facts might have 
given the task which I undertook a more successful issue, it 
ought not to be expected that psychology as a branch of study 
in college and normal schools should be easier of comprehen- 
sion than, say, mathematics. 
If any measure of success attend this effort, my first 
acknowledgments will be due my preceptors, Professor Fuller- 
ton, from whom I learned the method and value of intro- 
spective analysis, Professor Cattell, to whom I owe my first 
acquaintance with the ideals of the experimental method, and  
-P-A-G-E-6
yi PREFACE 
Professor Wundt, upon whose contributions to psychology, so 
nearly coincident with the science in its modern aspect, this 
volume of necessity largely draws. I was assisted in deter- 
mining the form of many of the experiments by Sanford’s 
original « Course in Experimental Psychology ” and Le Conte’s 
admirable volume on “Sight,” and in a more general way by 
the contributions of James, Cattell, Titchener, Miinsterberg, 
Jastrow, and Scripture. The charts and diagrams, excepting 
the half-tone reproductions, were prepared from original draw- 
ings. I indicate in the table of contents the sources from 
which I obtained a number of these illustrations. Of such 
obligations as will there appear in detail, I make in this 
place a general acknowledgment. 
The present form of this Manual is the result of slow growth 
from a short series of illustrative experiments presented in con- 
nection with a course of lectures given in Philadelphia in 1898. 
Classes of graduate and undergraduate students at the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania and Bryn Mawr College and classes of 
teachers have followed under my direction the several outlines 
of experiments which have served to fix the present form of 
the Manual. These earlier outlines have also been employed 
by Dr. McKeag, professor of psychology at Wilson College, 
and by Miss Prichard, instructor of psychology at the Phila- 
delphia Normal School. To Dr. McKeag and Miss Prichard 
I am indebted for many helpful suggestions. It is also a 
pleasing duty to acknowledge my obligations to Mr. Twitmyer, 
instructor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, 
whose assistance in the conduct of laboratory courses and the 
preparation of the Manual for the press resulted in many 
improvements in its form and content.

INTRODUCTION 
SECTION A 
Tur SrupEent’s RECORD OF THE EXPERIMENTS — 
A psychological experiment may be conducted with one of 
three somewhat different purposes in view. The expression 
of the result of an experiment will vary with its purpose. The 
purpose of an experiment may be (1) to call into existence in 
some individual mind those sensations, perceptions, and ideas 
that are to be observed, analyzed, and described. The obser- 
vation, analysis, and description of mental states thus brought 
into existence may be called experimental introspection. The 
experiment may require also (2) the observation and descrip- 
tion of some relation subsisting between the mental states 
and the objects (in technical language the stimuli) of the phys- 
ical world external to the body or between such mental states 
and the physiological processes of the body. The result calls 
for introspective analysis on the part of the person upon whom 
the experiment is performed, called the subject, and the careful 
observation of the physical or physiological conditions either 
by the subject himself or by a second person, called the experi- 
menter. The experiment may further require (3) a quantita- 
tive expression of this psycho-physical or psycho-physiological 
relation between a mental state on the one hand, and the 
physical stimuli or physiological processes on the other. This 
almost always requires an experiment to be performed by one

individual, the experimenter, upon another person or other 
persons, the subject or subjects, and may or may not require 
introspective analysis on the part of the subject. An experi- 
ment may often be of mixed type. The directions may call 
for (1) introspective analysis on the part of the subject, (2) the 
observation of a general psycho-physical relation, and (83) the 
quantitative expression of that relation in the form of an 
average result. 
An important result that should be sought in using this 
Manual is the formation of habits of sound reasoning. The 
instructor must therefore guard against a constant tendency of 
the student to make generalizations and draw conclusions that 
are not justified by the immediate results of his experiments. 
A more fatal error into which the student will often fall is to 
use the experiment simply to illustrate some preconceived theory 
or some conclusion not actually obtained from the experiment 
itself. I find it necessary in the beginning to criticise the indi- 
vidual student’s report of his results with great minuteness. 
Throughout the course, the instructor should insist upon the 
expression of all results in good logical form. I find it advis- 
able to have the student make his reports in the first person 
rather than in the indefinite “third personal” form, which his 
modesty or carelessness will favor. 
It is desirable that each student should keep a notebook, 
which ought to follow a prescribed form. A convenient note- 
book is made from separate sheets of note-paper size with holes 
punched at the top or side of the sheet. These sheets can be 
fastened together in any desired order, removed from time to 
time by the instructor for examination and correction, and after- 
ward returned for insertion in the proper place in the notebook. 
The sheets and separate cardboard backs can be purchased at 
small expense from the stationer. The length of the reports 
may vary as the experiment, in the opinion of the instructor, 
justifies elaborate or brief treatment.

INTRODUCTION Xx 
The notebook may be constructed on the following plan: 
1. Enter the heading of the chapter of the Manual as given. 
2. Enter under each experiment : 
(a) The number and title of the experiment as given in 
the Manual. These titles and sub-titles will serve the 
student as a condensed outline of the contents of the 
experiment and also as aids to the memory in recalling 
the general discussion of the subject-matter of the experi- 
ment and its place in the logical development of the 
course. 
(6) An exact description of the apparatus used and the 
procedure followed by the student. The Manual gives 
the directions which the student is to follow but not enter 
in his notebook. He is to report in his own language 
exactly what he proceeded to do in order to follow out 
the directions given. If the experiment is not performed 
in accordance with the requirements of the Manual, which 
may frequently happen through modifications introduced 
by the instructor to suit his special conditions, the student 
should report the procedure he has actually followed and 
not that of the Manual. Much time may appear wasted 
in compelling the student to describe the pieces of appa- 
ratus used, — time hardly to be considered as given to the 
study of psychology. Many students, however, greatly 
need the training in observation and exact description 
which will follow the requirement to describe exactly a 
few of the instruments employed by them in this course. 
Simple as these instruments are, the student will find it 
no easy task to describe in exact terms what is before 
him. Ihave found even graduate students sitting helpless 
before the very simple color top shown in the diagram on 
page 175, unable to find adequate language to describe its 
construction and use.
-P-A-G-E-22
  xxii INTRODUCTION 
(c) The result of the experiment as made by the student. 
Do not let him report more than he has actually obtained 
as the result of his experiment. 
(d) Conclusions from the result of that particular experi- 
ment. In some cases, I find it very difficult to distin- 
guish in my own mind between a result and a conclusion. 
The distinction, however, is in most experiments readily 
observed. If, for example, a student place on the color 
top a small amount of white and a large amount of red, 
from which when the top is spun he gets a sensation of 
color which is indistinguishable from that which he receives 
from the red alone; and if he then make four successive 
trials, increasing on each trial the amount of white and 
diminishing the amount of red, until upon the fifth trial 
he receives a sensation which is indistinguishable from that 
given by white alone, the result of his experiment has given 
him five different sensations: a sensation of red, another 
of white, and three intermediate sensations of whitish-red 
color. His result is not a continuous series of sensations 
but five different sensations. This result justifies the con- 
clusion that, if instead of five trials he had made a suffi- 
ciently great number, he could have passed by insensible 
gradations from red through tints of red to white. (See 
also the discussion on page 106 seq.) 
8. After an experiment or a series of closely related experi- 
ments, let the student enter some general discussion of 
the facts and principles involved. This may include a 
summary of the discussion contained in the Manual or 
contributed by the instructor, and opinions reached by 
the student himself through original reflection. 
I have often been surprised and highly gratified by the 
quality of these discussions and by the originality of thought 
and treatment displayed in the notebooks of students whose 
previous preparation had not led me to expect it. I cannot
-P-A-G-E-23
INTRODUCTION xxiii 
help ascribing this in part to the independent method of work 
which this Manual requires of the student. I always place 
a greater value upon a little original thinking on the part of 
the student than upon much copying and learning of the con- 
tents of the Manual or of other text-books. The necessity for 
independent thinking is brought home to the student in a for- 
cible way if a number of text-books are used for supplementary 
reference, each student being held responsible for one text-book 
and reporting from time to time before the entire class the 
opinions of the authority whom he has consulted on the sub- 
ject-matter then under discussion. This method will show the 
student what a grievous error it is to suppose that psychology 
is a body of absolutely fixed principles, for he will find psycholo- 
gists differing in their opinions as much as he and his fellow- 
students do. It has been my experience to find exceptional 
students treating the discussion of the subject-matter of certain 
of these experiments more satisfactorily than some well-consid- 
ered text-books. The requirement of original thinking must 
greatly enhance the independent mental attitude of the student 
toward life in general; if he is to become a teacher, it must 
increase his insight and judgment with respect to the mental 
processes of the children under his pedagogical care. 
The details of this plan for the notebook should be strictly 
adhered to, particularly in the early part of the course, when 
much time may be profitably spent in drilling the students 
properly to report their work. When somewhat advanced in 
the course, they may be allowed to make their reports in an 
abridged form, and the instructor may remit somewhat the 
severity with which he criticises the descriptions and discus- 
sions. The instructor. will determine for himself the measure 
of time and effort that is due the training of the student to 
habits of psychological thinking and to what extent this must 
be abridged in order to present a sufficiently complete outline 
of the fundamental principles of psychology.

SECTION B 
APPARATUS AND Books OF REFERENCE 
No apparatus is necessary for the effective use of this Manual. 
The charts accompanying the Manual have been prepared for 
the special purpose of supplying material to serve as appli- 
ances for the conduct of the experiments. The student may 
insert these charts in his notebook in the proper place as part 
of his description of the experiment. If this is done with 
some completeness, the notebook at the end of the course 
will constitute an extensive outline of psychology. In schools 
where it is necessary to pass the book from class to class, the 
student can make drawings of the more important figures and 
insert these in his notebook. It is not advisable to spend too 
much time in making these drawings models of neatness and 
accuracy. 
Many experiments call for the use of simple materials which 
it is supposed will be readily accessible and for which no outlay 
of money will be required. Among these may be mentioned a 
mirror, a long thin book, three coins, a cane or any long stick, 
receptacles for holding water, string, a feather, a weight or any 
small heavy object, a watch (which will probably be supplied by 
the student), some sugar and salt, and bottles or boxes of differ- 
ent sizes. In addition to this list of simple materials, a small out- 
lay of not more than five dollars will increase the effectiveness 
and number of the experiments that can be employed. A few 
experiments call for instruments which may or may not be pur- 
chased as the instructor finds the means at his disposal, these 
experiments not being essential to complete the course. An 
appendix (page 229) gives every appliance or instrument called 
for in each experiment of the Manual, excepting the experi- 
mental charts which are given in a list of charts (page xi) 
following the table of contents.

INTRODUCTION XXV 
A small collection of books of reference is desirable for effec- 
tive work with some classes of students. This library should 
include a number of standard works of reference, text-books, 
the journals of psychology, and thoroughly good text-books on 
physics and physiology. The time given to the subject of 
psychology and the intellectual maturity of the student must 
determine the extent to which recourse will be had to these 
books. It is very helpful to require individual students to 
present short abstracts giving the views of different authors on 
special points, although care must be taken lest they be thrown 
into intellectual confusion by a multiplicity of contending 
opinions. If the class as a whole cannot be safely required to 
consult different authorities, occasional reference to standard 
text-books or to some special article in the current number of 
a periodical will be very stimulating and helpful to those more 
seriously interested. 
SECTION C 
THE SELECTION OF EXPERIMENTS 
The number of experiments is sufficiently large to enable the 
instructor to select those which are best adapted to his resources 
and the time at his disposal. He may employ these experi- 
ments either to present a very brief outline or to serve as the 
basis for a more thoroughgoing exposition of the fundamental 
facts and principles of psychology. A satisfactory outline of 
the course does not require every experiment to be performed 
in the detail called for by the Manual. Certain experiments 
may even be passed over with a few words, provided the prin- 
ciple involved be not omitted. Two or three different experi- 
ments are occasionally given to illustrate the same principle. 
The instructor may also find some experiments better suited 
than others for the definite purpose he may have in mind in
-P-A-G-E-26
    xxvi INTRODUCTION 
offering instruction in psychology. Some experiments are 
better adapted for larger classes, and others are more easily 
performed with small classes. When an experiment can be 
performed by the instructor, acting as an experimenter, upon 
all the members of the class acting as subjects, this procedure 
should be adopted for the purpose of saving time. Certain 
experiments require that the members of the class be divided 
into groups of two or three. In such cases I often give two or 
three experiments to a group of students, requiring each student 
to make but a single experiment upon the other members of the 
group, although he acts as subject for each of the other members 
of the group in turn. Thus the student reports the results of 
but one experiment, although he has the advantage of having 
taken part in a larger number. Where home work can be required 
of the student, it is‘possible to have certain experiments per- 
formed by the student at home. Where it is impossible to 
require work at home, it may still be desirable to omit the class 
demonstration of certain experiments that can be performed at 
home, suggesting to the students that the limitation of time for 
class work has necessitated their omission, and that it will be 
left to their interest in the subject voluntarily to perform these 
experiments without the compulsion and credit of class work.

‘ ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
CHAPTER I 
APPERCEPTION 
Experiment J. The perception of an external object is determined 
by apperception as well as by sensation. 
Turn over the page and look at the figure on Chart 1. What do 
you see at the first glance? Is it a staircase? Does your first 
perception remain? Can you see a staircase as though viewed from 
underneath ? Can you see the figure as an arrangement of black 
lines drawn without perspective on the plane surface of the chart ? 
This figure is often called the staircase illusion. It is really 
not an illusion, unless all perception is an illusion. The external 
object, or stimulus, which acts upon the sense organ of vision is 
a certain number of black lines upon white paper. Whatever 
comes into your mind, when the eyes are directed to the figure, 
is called a mental content. If you see only “black lines on the 
white surface” of the chart, the mental content is relatively 
simple. When the mental content is more complex, — for 
example, the perception of the drawing of a staircase, — the 
complexity is due not to the lines of the figure actually before 
your eyes, but to former perceptions of staircases, drawings, 
and similar objects that have been seen, touched, and handled. 
By virtue of this experience, the mind itself contributes more 
to the formation of the present perception than does the action 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  2 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
of the physical stimulus upon the sense organ. For this reason, 
the mind is said to ap-perceive the external object. 
It is easier and more “natural” to perceive the figure of 
Chart 1 as a “staircase” than it is to see merely “black lines 
on white paper.” In fact, we seem to perceive “ the staircase ” 
as immediately and instantaneously as we hear the sound of a 
bell or feel the heat of a stove. The mental contents with 
which we react or respond to the sound of the bell, the heat of 
the stove, and the black and white of the chart are the results 
of the process of sensation, a native or inborn capacity of every 
one possessed of normal sense organs and brain. The percep- 
tion of “staircase,” on the other hand, is only in very small part 
due to sensation. It is chiefly the product of a mental process, 
called apperception, that is formed and developed, through expe- 
rience and education, during the life of each individual human 
being. This development is reflected more particularly in the 
acquisition of memories of former experience, and in the for- 
mation of new habits. In accordance with the character and 
number of these memories and habits, a mind reacts to a simple 
stimulus so as to form a complex mental content, called a per- 
ception of the object. Every perception is a synthesis, or com- 
bination, of the part contributed by apperception and the part 
contributed by sensation. What is received by the mind through 
sensation is always supplemented and elaborated by the process 
of apperception. The progressive growth and modification of 
each individual mind is called its ontogeny. Through appercep- 
tion, therefore, is effected an ontogenetic elaboration of the simple 
mental contents that are the bare results of the stimulation of 
sense organs. 
It is often difficult to demonstrate the contribution of apper- 
ception so as to distinguish it from that of sensation, because 
the completed perception usually seems to be an unanalyzable 
unit directly and entirely inspired by the stimulus. The experi- 
ment with the staircase figure makes this distinction clear.
-P-A-G-E-29

-P-A-G-E-30
    4 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
One and the same stimulus is shown to give rise to two different 
perceptions. This cannot be due either to the stimulus or to 
sensation, because the eyes and the brain are stimulated in each 
case by the same physical object. Neither perception is an illu- 
sion; “the staircase from underneath” is as true a perception 
of the lines as is “the staircase from above,” although the 
latter perception is the more readily formed in many minds. 
A figure drawn without definite perspective, as are those upon 
which are based the first three experiments of this Manual, is 
called an equivocal figure, because the stimulus is not able to 
elicit decisively any one of the possible contributions of apper- 
ception. In consequence, your neighbor’s mind may not react 
to a given stimulus with a mental content similar to yours, nor 
need your mind react at all times with the same perception; 
but all minds will manifest at all times an apperceiving tendency 
to supplement and elaborate, in some way, the mental results 
of the action of a stimulus upon the sense organ. 
ExprERIMenT IJ. A perception may be determined by the association 
of an anticipating mental image or idea of the object — i.e., by pre- 
perception. 
Look again at the figure on Chart 1. Can you see this figure as 
a strip of cardboard extending obliquely from the upper left-hand 
corner to the lower right-hand corner, bent at right angles like an 
accordion plait, and situated in front of the plane of the apparent 
background? The outline of the figure will then give the perception 
of a continuous. plane surface, a background, in front of which is 
suspended the plaited strip. Can you vary the angles of the 
plait, causing them to appear at will as either right, obtuse, or acute 
angles ? 
This perception of the figure is often more difficult to obtain 
than the “staircase” perceptions. It is therefore necessary to 
think vividly beforehand of what you expect to see. The
-P-A-G-E-31
    
APPERCEPTION 5 
anticipation of a perception by a thought, idea, or mental image 
is called preperception. Some may be unable to see even the 
“staircase from underneath,” until, through attention to what 
is expected to be seen, apperception is assisted by a vivid pre- 
perceiving image. It is important to distinguish associated pre- 
perception from apperception. When the words, “ Do you see 
an accordion plait?” are seen or heard, they are associated with 
a visual image of the object indicated by the words. This 
visual image, due to the reproductive process of memory, is in 
turn associated with the lines on the paper as these may have 
been originally perceived, either as “lines” or as a “staircase.” 
Through this associated preperceiving image, the simpler visual 
sense perception is supplemented and modified to correspond to 
the particular object of preperception. 
When this new perception does find place in consciousness, 
it will seem to be as directly inspired by the figure, and as 
natural, as did the perception of “staircase.” Associated pre- 
perception accomplishes the same final result in the formation 
of a perception as does apperception. When the “staircase 
from underneath” and the “accordion plait” perceptions are 
once obtained, it may be difficult to keep any one perception 
in mind to the exclusion of others; a continuous and unavoid- 
able fluctuation from one perception to another will be observed. 
It appears from these experiments that the apperceiving tend- 
ency to react to the stimulus so as to form a perception of 
“staircase from above” is already perfected by most minds, 
whereas a similar tendency to perceive “staircase from under- 
neath” or “plait” is developed only with the assistance of a 
preliminary association of definite and more or less vivid memory 
images. The perception of “staircase,” which arose in mind at 
first sight without consciousness of any preceding associated 
image, is dependent upon an apperceiving tendency also origi- 
nally developed from associated memories of similar perceptions. 
These memories, however, do not have conscious or psychical  
-P-A-G-E-32
  6 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
existence at the moment of perception. Their influence in the 
past can only be inferred from the increased complexity of the 
present perception. Such modification of the apperceiving 
process as may be attributed to them is accomplished. 
This growth and training of apperception through individual 
experience is somewhat analogous to a change in taste for some 
article of food. For example, one does not find the taste of 
olives agreeable at first, however acceptable they may subse- 
quently become. No one will ascribe his acquired fondness for 
olives to associations with, or memories of, the first three or 
four that were eaten. The eating of olives develops little by 
little a mental tendency to react in a new way to the old 
stimulus, ¢.¢., with an agreeable taste sensation instead of with 
the former disagreeable one. 
Every perception exhibits some degree of apperceptional 
elaboration. Suppose that two men fall within the field of 
your visual perception: the one is your father, let us say, and 
the other, a man whom you have met but a few times and, in 
consequence, do not at once recognize. You would describe 
the two perceptions in the words, “I see (perceive) my father,” 
and “I see (perceive) a man.” In the second instance, you 
may add: “I ought to know who he is; let me think where I 
have met him before. Why, his name is just on the tip of my 
tongue!” As you endeavor to place him within the circle 
of your acquaintance, you will reproduce visual and other 
memories of the occasions of your meeting him; his image 
will take its place in your mind along with the images of 
other persons; you will think of the person who made you 
acquainted with him; you will try to recall your conversation 
at the time. Suddenly the events with which he has been 
connected in your past experience stand out clearly in your 
mind. Recognition follows. His name is formed by the tongue. 
Thus these preperceiving memories, associated with your per- 
ception of “a man whom I ought to recognize but cannot,” will
-P-A-G-E-33
  
APPERCEPTION 7 
produce a new mental content to which you may give expres- 
sion in such words or thoughts as, “ That’s the man I met at 
the railroad station; his name is Jones.” If, in the future, he 
should become better known to you, the necessity for calling up 
and associating preperceiving memories will gradually diminish, 
and in the course of time you perceive “Mr. Jones” on sight. 
Associated preperception will then have been transformed, 
through development, into apperception. 
The perception of “my father” is so immediate and so devoid 
of associated preperceptions that you would never say, “I see 
a man whom I remember to be my father.” The apperception 
of “father” has its origin in the perceptions of the first years of 
life, a period of which you retain few, if any, definite memories. 
You do not perceive “father” by an association of the memories 
of either remote or recent experiences of your father. Expe- 
riences, too numerous and remote to be recalled, have developed 
the apperceiving tendency necessary to elaborate the result of 
that one stimulus alone, so as to form the particular mental 
content which you call the perception “my father.” 
Apperception is observed even in simpler perceptions, for 
example, in the perception “man.” This perception is distin- 
guished from that of “woman,” or of “horse,” or of “church,” 
or of any other object, only through former experience of 
these objects. Yet the attitude of mind in perceiving “man” 
is not that of seeing some indefinite thing, which, by association 
with memories of men and other objects, is supplemented and 
transformed into the perception “man”; it comes into mind 
immediately, a completed and distinct perception. Even when 
the perception is restricted, say to the “red color” of his hair, 
the mental content, a color sensation, is partly the result of 
former experience of variously colored objects. A simple sen- 
sation, in the sense of a mental content absolutely unmodified 
by individual experience, does not exist except perhaps at the 
initial moment of conscious life.

APPERCEPTION 9 
The student must be cautioned against confounding the terms 
“apperception,” “perception,” and “sensation,” even though 
he cannot expect to obtain a clear understanding of their exact 
meaning at the outset of his course in psychology. Definitions 
alone will not enable him to comprehend fully the processes of 
mind to which these terms refer. The processes are so complex 
that it is possible, only by making him acquainted with the 
various phenomena of mind, to develop gradually the appercep- 
tion necessary for their comprehension. 
A physical stimulus, for example, a red color, gives rise to a 
mental content which the psychologist may call at one time a 
perception, and at another, a sensation. Thus the student will 
meet with the terms, “perception of red” and “sensation of 
red.” Sensations are assumed to be determined entirely by the 
inborn activity of sense organs and sensory centers in the brain. 
Although it is appropriate thus to designate the simplest pos- 
sible mental contents as sensations, it must be remembered that 
they may also be referred to as perceptions, whenever it is desired 
to emphasize the fact that even the simplest mental result of the 
stimulation of a sense organ is always, though in some cases 
only in small part, the product of the same mental process that 
is so clearly manifest in the more extensive apperceptional con- 
tribution to complexer contents. Indeed, if we wish to call 
special attention to the important réle played by apperception 
and temporarily to exclude sensation from consideration, we 
may ‘correctly say, “I apperceive the red color,” as also, «I 
apperceive the man or my father.” In general, therefore, per- 
ceptions are mental contents due to the joint activity of sensa- 
tion and apperception. Sensations are the simplest perceptions 
relatively. They appear to be approximately unmodified by 
apperception, remaining, for the most part, as they were at the 
beginning of conscious life. They may exist in mind either as 
single and discrete mental contents or as the combined and 
component parts, called elements, of more complex contents.
-P-A-G-E-36
10 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Another source of possible confusion to the student is the 
use of the term “perception” to designate both the mental con- 
tent and also the process by which the content is determined ; 
thus in the sentences, “I have a distinct perception of a church” 
(content), and, “It is through perception that we get our knowl- 
edge of the external world” (process). Some psychologists use 
the term “percept” for the content, and restrict the term 
“perception ” to designate the process. In this Manual, « per- 
ception” usually means the content; whenever the process of 
perception is implied by the context, it is intended to refer to 
the joint activity of sensation and apperception, and not to a 
third process distinct from these. The term “sensation” will 
be employed, as may be required by the context, to designate 
either the process or the mental content. 
EXxpreRIMenT III. The apperceptional contribution in the perceptions 
of equivocal stimuli. 
A. Can you see Fig. a, Chart 2, bent at an angle directed either 
toward you or away from you? 
B. In what two different positions can you see the cube, Fig. 4, 
Chart 2? 
C. Observe the rapid and incessant fluctuations in the percep- 
tion of Fig. a, Chart 3. 
D. Observe in Fig. 6, Chart 3, that the repeated pattern seems 
now to recede, now to advance. Can you keep the repeated elements 
for any considerable time in the same plane? Have you ever 
observed similar fluctuations in wall paper or dress patterns? 
E. Ave there six or seven blocks in Fig. a of Chart 5 ? 
Is the cause of these fluctuating perceptions to be ascribed to the 
figures, to apperception, or to associated preperception? Do the 
figures give rise to the perceptions of objects having a spacial 
quality, i.e, depth or solidity, not possessed by the figures them- 
selves? Describe, in each case, the apperceptional contribution 
which makes the perception more complex than its stimulus.

Experiment IV. Variable and individual apperception. 
A. Observe either a duck or a rabbit in Fig. a of Chart 4. 
B. Describe Fig. 6, Chart 4. You may see a six-pointed star; a 
hexagon with a triangle constructed on each side; two superimposed 
triangles, etc. 
C. Describe Fig. c, Chart 4. The sixteen crosses may be per- 
ceived as four horizontal rows of four each; four vertical rows of 
four each; a square of four on a side, enclosing a square of two on 
a side; four squares of two on a side, etc. 
D. What are your perceptions of 6 and ¢ of Chart 5? 
E. Observe intently for some time d and e of Chart 5. Are 
you able to form perceptions from these indefinite stimuli ? 
F. Do you ever see various forms or faces in the flames of an 
open fire, in the clouds, in wall-paper patterns, or in the arrangement 
of tea grounds in the bottom of a cup ? 
The perceptions to which some of these figures give rise will 
appear to have been constructed by a fanciful play of the imagi- 
nation rather than by apperception or associated preperception. 
Fancy or imagination, however, does not differ fundamentally 
from memory; both involve a reproduction of the elements 
of past experience... Memory images reproduce with consider- 
able fidelity former perceptions; the images of fancy are more 
unusual and accidental, but nevertheless their component parts 
are never absolutely foreign to past experience, no matter what 
oddities their combination may present. Still other and char; 
acteristically different mental contents, which are appropriately 
described as ideas, thoughts, or concepts, may have been observed 
associated with and transforming the perceptions of these figures. 
Ideas are also developed through individual experience and are 
given actual existence in a mind by the reproductive process. 
Of all the mental contents that may be associated with a per-

same mind at different times; they seem, in consequence, to be 
least directly inspired by the stimulus. 
In some cases, there will have been associated with a percep- 
tion either ideas or images of memory and fancy, which remain 
discrete accompaniments of the original perception without 
transforming it into a new perception. Thus a cloud remains 
a cloud, although associated with the suggested fanciful image 
of some animal. In this and similar cases, the stimulus gives 
rise to a perception which starts into existence one or more 
associated contents due to the reproductive process. This 
mental situation is very different from that brought about by 
such figures as the staircase and the seven cubes. The latter 
figure, for example, does not call up a perception of six cubes 
which has associated with it a memory image of seven cubes; 
the stimulus calls up each of the two perceptions directly and 
each perception momentarily excludes the other. 
These experiments have served to show that the mind may 
react to a stimulus with one of three different results. These 
are: (1) a perception, the product of apperception and sensation ; 
(2) a perception due to sensation primarily, but transformed 
through an association of preperceiving images contributed by 
the reproductive process of memory, fancy, or thought; and (8) a 
perception, which is formed either as 1 or 2, accompanied or fol- 
lowed by other mental contents contributed by the reproductive 
process and thus initiating a train or series of associations.

A. Are the rings on Chart 6 complete and interlaced, or are they 
broken rings laid carefully together? Is not the latter more nearly 
what is represented by the figure? Is not the figure in reality 
composed of a number of broken curved lines? Why are you com- 
* pelled to see complete interlacing rings ? 
B. In Fig. 6, Chart 6, does the column appear to pass in front of

the arch? Is it not unnatural to see the arch broken and interrupted 
by the column, and yet, so far as the figure itself is concerned, 
might not the lines of the arch and column be in the same plane ? 
We have repeatedly seen objects near us obstructing the per- 
ception of other objects beyond them. This has formed apper- 
ception so as to make possible and natural the one perception of 
the arch and column as though they were situated at different 
distances or depths in front of us. 
C. Observe the size of a book lying on the table within reach. 
Move the book to the middle of the table and then to the opposite 
edge. Does the book appear to change in size? What change has 
taken place in the size of the retinal image ? 
Have you ever observed, from a great elevation, men and animals, 
and other well-known objects? Why do they appear so small ? 
The diagram on this page is designed to illustrate the rela- 
tive size of an object and its image formed upon the inner poste- 
tior surface, called the retina, of the eye-globe. Let the arrow 
  Diacram I. The relative size and inversion of the retinal image.

vision, and let a’! be the image of that object upon the retina. 
The lines aa! and 00! represent the rays of light reflected from 
the extremities of the object, passing through the lens, and 
crossing before they reach the retina. Between these lines 
extended into space outward from the eye, we can draw at any

distance from the eye another arrow, for example, zy. As the 
ray lines from the extremities of wy, ie., va’ and yb’, coincide 
within the eye with those from the extremities of ab, the 
retinal images of zy and abd will be of the same size, although 
ab is smaller than zy. Conversely, the same object at different 
distances from the eye will cast images of different size upon 
the retina. Thus the dotted arrow ed, equal in length to zy, at 
the position of ad, casts upon the retina the image e’d’, larger 
than a’/b', which represents the size of the image cast by the 
same arrow at the position of vy. 
If a book, as suggested by this experiment, is seen first at a 
distance of say two feet from the retina and then at a distance 
of six feet, the retinal image of the book in the first position 
will have three times the length and breadth of the image of 
the book in the second position, and nine times the area. Our 
minds must modify what is received through the retina, or the 
book would appear to grow rapidly smaller as it is moved away 
from the eye. The knowledge of the actual size of an object 
would seem to be more effective in determining the perception 
of the object than the changing retinal images. _ 
This apperceptional modification of sensation is constant and 
universal. It requires some unusual distance, as a great eleva~ 
tion, producing a very considerable diminution in the size of the 
retinal image, to overcome the tendency to elaborate the simple 
mental result of a stimulation of the retina into a perception of 
the object as actually known to us. 
It will be observed that the diagram represents the retinal 
image inverted, relative to the position of the external arrow. 
This inversion is due to the refracting properties of the lens. 
How is it that we see objects right side up, if their retinal 
images are thus upside down? This question is puzzling only 
so long as we fail to recognize the significance of apperception 
in determining the perception of objects. We see the object, i.e., 
the arrow, not the retinal image of the arrow. No one is ever
-P-A-G-E-45
APPERCEPTION 19 
aware of what is going on in the retina when he is in the act of 
perceiving an object. It is true that we perceive the arrow by 
means of the retinal image, but we perceive it likewise by means 
of the optic nerve and brain. There are no images in the nerve, 
nor yet in the brain. Moreover, the physiological processes are 
such that “right side up” and “ wrong side up” do not apply 
to them. As the size of the retinal image is relatively unim- 
portant in determining the perceived size of the object, so also 
is the spacial inversion of the image. “Right side up” is the 
customary upper side for perception. The habitual mode of 
perception is dependent upon more extensive experience of 
the object than is gained from the visual sensations due to the 
retinal image; for example, upon our walking to and about 
the object, handling it, etc. The retinal image changes with 
every movement of the body, head, and eyes, but in the course 
of mental development repeated perceptions have established 
the tendency to perceive an unchanging object of constant size 
and position. Experiments in Chapter IV will present the more 
important features of this development of space perceptions. 
Experiment VI. An associated preperception may produce an illu- 
sion or false perception. 
A. Bend a card (a visiting card will do) so as to enclose an 
oblique angle. Stand the card upon its edge with the fold vertical 
and directed away from you, so that you will be looking into the 
concavity formed by the bent sides of the card. Place the card on 
a table in such position that no marked shadows are cast across 
either side of the concavity. Stand about a yard away from the 
card, looking somewhat downward into the concavity. Strongly 
imagine the two sides to be bent in just the opposite way, so as to 
form a convexity; to do this, think the vertical line of the fold to 
be nearer than the edges of the card. You will find that you can 
make the card appear either convex or concave at will. The former 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
20 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
perception will be an illusion, the latter will correspond to the 
external real object. Turn the card about, so that the convexity 
will be directed toward you. Can you see the sides of the card to 
be concave ? 
This experiment is somewhat similar to Experiment III, A, 
but in the present case the spacial relations of the parts of a real 
object are apparently changed. This is therefore an illusion 
—a false perception — whereas Fig. a, Chart 2, offers a choice 
of two perceptions of an equivocal figure, neither perception 
being false to the real conditions of the stimulus. 
B. Get three boxes (pill boxes or bottles will do) of marked 
difference in size, but, if possible, of the same shape. Place in each 
box some small shot or sand so that the three boxes are of exactly 
the same weight. Fill the boxes with cotton or any material that 
will keep the shot or sand from moving about. Lift the boxes and 
observe the apparent difference in weight. 
The smallest box will seem to be the heaviest, and the largest 
box the lightest in weight. ‘This illusion in weight is due to: 
(1) the visual perception of the actual difference in size; (2) the 
fact that large things are usually heavy and small things light 
—which has given rise to an apperceiving tendency that causes 
us to perceive the large box as heavy, before we lift it, and the 
small box as light ; (8) the contrast between the preperceived 
weight (very heavy or very light) and the actual weight of the 
box (medium), which causes the preperceived “heavy box ” to 
seem lighter than the box of medium weight, and the preper- 
ceived “light box” to seem heavier. 
C. The measurement of the amount of this illusion. Take a 
very small and a very large flask, bottle, or box. Fill the smaller 
one with shot so as to be of considerable weight. Require the 
subject (the person upon whom the experiment is made) to fill the 
larger one until it is judged by him to be just equal in weight to
-P-A-G-E-47
  APPERCEPTION 21 
the smaller. Weigh the larger and record the amount by which 
this exceeds the smaller in actual weight. 
To determine whether the subject is constant in his overestima- 
tion of the weight of the small box, repeat this experiment four 
times, so that you will have five different records of the amount of 
overestimation. The amount will probably not be the same in the 
five trials. Add the five quantities together and divide by 5 to 
get an average result. ‘Then find the amount by which each of the 
quantities differs from the average result. These will be the varia- 
tions of each of the five trials from the average of the five trials. 
Add these variations and get an average variation. 
In making this experiment, in one case, a four-ounce Florence 
flask loaded with shot to weigh two hundred grams was com- 
pared by the subject with a much larger glass battery jar filled 
with sand. A student’s record of this experiment showed that 
the larger object was estimated equal to the smaller when its 
actual weight was in excess of the smaller: 
On first trialby . . . . 250 grams 
On second trialby . . . 153 grams 
On third trialby . . . . 167 grams 
On fourth trialby . . . 189 grams 
On fifth trialby . . . . 142 grams 
The following table shows the method of treating these five 
results to get an average result and average variation.

average variation, the less significant is the average result as the 
expression of a tendency to overestimate by a constant amount 
the weight of small objects with reference to that of large ones. 
A large average variation may lead one to suspect carelessness 
on the part of the subject or experimenter, ignorance on the 
part of the subject as to what was expected of him, or a real 
uncertainty in his judgment due to want of practice or some 
other cause. It cannot be expected, however, that judgments 
of the amount of this illusion will be very constant, for the con- 
ditions of the experiment make the preperception necessarily 
variable. 
Experiment VII. Apperception may produce an illusion. 
A. Read the preamble of the Constitution of the United States 
as printed on Chart 7, and count the number of errors discovered. 
Go over the selection a second time, examining every letter care- 
fully. What is the total number of errors? 
The failure to observe an error demonstrates that the tend- 
ency to apperceive words as they would appear when correctly 
printed is strong enough to modify the perception received 
from the word as it is really printed. 
B. Let a number of students or other persons (the subjects) be 
prepared to write down words at dictation. Let the experimenter 
(a student or the instructor) call out distinctly, but without unusual 
emphasis, the following words and nonsense syllables: cat, hog, 
fif, log, mere, pod, jug, ind, han, seef, there, a, sos, where, sod, mud, 
hub, than, neg, trite, stro. In what different ways do the subjects 
apperceive these simple auditory stimuli? 
If the subjects have seen these syllables, preperception may cause 
them to be correctly apprehended; in this case, the experimenter 
should prepare a new series.

Experiment VIII. The facilitation and development of apper- 
ception. 
Cut from a sheet of paper or thin cardboard a rectangular slit 
4 inch wide and 2% inches long. Let the experimenter place this 
sheet over the words of Chart 7, 0, so as to expose at one time 
only the three words in the same horizontal line. Place the chart 
before the subject with the words in easy position for reading. 
Let the subject read aloud the words thus exposed. Move the 
sheet so that a new line of words is exposed to view. Do not let 
the subject see these words; hold a piece of cardboard just above 
the words to screen them from his gaze. Direct the subject to pre- 
pare to read, as quickly as possible, the words that will be exposed 
to view when the screening card is removed. Remove the card for 
a moment only. Require the subject to write the words or letters 
he has seen. If he has failed to give all the words actually exposed 
to his view, remove the screening card a second time for a moment 
only. Require him to write, in order, the words or letters now 
seen. Repeat this procedure until the subject is able to perceive, 
on momentary exposure, the three words. Try with the three 
words of ten different lines. Determine the average number of 
exposures necessary to form a correct and complete perception of 
three words. 
The training of apperception, which has been accomplished 
through the ordinary school instruction in reading, makes pos- 
sible the perception of a limited number of words, or parts of a 
word at least, on a very short exposure. When the same words 
are momentarily exposed for a second time, apperception is 
assisted and facilitated by the former incomplete perception of 
the words. The apperceptional tendency to perceive words in 
general has become an apperceptional tendency to perceive 
particular letters and words. In the facilitation of appercep- 
tion, thus made evident by the greater number of letters and 
words comprised in the perception received from a momentary 
exposure, is illustrated the usual course of the development of 
apperception through repeated experience.

ATTENTION 
Experiment IX. Preperception increases the perceptibility of 
threshold stimuli. 
A. Auditory stimulus. Let the subject, seated in a quiet room, 
keep the head steady and the eyes shut. Hold a watch, that 
has not been seen or heard by the subject, at a distance of at 
least three yards, straight out from his right ear, i.e. at a right 
angle to the median vertical plane of the head. Move the watch 
slowly and steadily toward the ear. Require the subject to give a 
signal as soon as he hears the faintest ticking of the watch. Stop 
when this point is reached and measure the distance with a yard- 
stick or tape. It is convenient to have two experimenters, one 
to hold and move the watch, the other to measure and record the 
distance. Make three trials and average the three results. 
Let the subject now listen attentively for some seconds to the 
sound of the watch held close to the ear. Then determine, as 
before, the average maximum distance of three trials. Is the dis- 
tance greater or less than that obtained before the subject became 
familiar with the sound of the particular watch employed ? 
The greater the distance of the watch from the ear, the less 
is the intensity of the stimulus of sound when it reaches the 
ear. “The distance at which the ticking watch can be heard 
will be greater in the second set of experiments than in the first, 
because the memory of a sound sensation just heard is more 
vivid and definite, and therefore more effective, than remote 
and less definite memories of the sound of watches. Even in 
the first set of three trials the second trial should give a greater 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  26 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
distance than the first, and the third a greater distance than the 
second. ‘This increase in the distance is due to the effect of 
practice, which, by developing a more definite memory image, 
makes preperception more effective in reducing the threshold 
of sensation, i.e., the intensity of a stimulus just sufficient to 
give rise to a simple mental content. The mental preparation 
for a particular stimulus is the important feature of expectant 
attention. 
The expression “ threshold of sensation ” is a figure of speech 
based upon the following thought. The mind is like a house, 
outside of which are the physical stimuli. Weak stimuli 
cannot cross the threshold of this figurative house of the mind 
to excite sensation. The threshold may be high ior low. 
Expectant attention lowers the threshold and thereby allows a 
stimulus, which would otherwise remain below the threshold, to 
give rise to sensation. A stimulus strong enough to awaken a 
vague sensation may be too weak to be distinctly perceived and 
discriminated. We can therefore distinguish various thresholds 
of complex perception and discrimination; these are generally 
higher than the threshold of simple sensation. 
B. Visual stimuli. Take five sheets of paper and make a dif- 
ferent mark or sign of equal size and distinctness upon each, — 
e.g, & Cross, a circle, a square, a triangle, etc. Fasten each of these 
sheets in succession to the wall or blackboard at such distance from 
the subject that he cannot tell whether the sheet is marked or not. 
Do not let the subject know what marks he is to expect. Let the 
subject move toward each of the five sheets in succession and report 
(1) when he sees that there is something on the paper and (2) when 
he distinguishes and recognizes the mark. Measure the distances. 
Record the two results for each of the five different marks and get 
the average distances at which the five marks can be respectively 
(1) perceived and (2) discriminated. 
Repeat these experiments, but let the subject examine the mark on 
the sheet before each trial. Do the results show that preperceptional
-P-A-G-E-53
  ATTENTION 27 
attention has increased the distance at which perception and dis- 
crimination are possible, or, in other words, has it lowered the 
respective thresholds of perception and discrimination ? 
Experiment X. Attention involves the adjustment of a sense 
organ as well as the mental preparation for a particular stimulus. 
A. Auditory stimulus. Begin with the watch close to the sub- 
ject’s right ear. Move the watch away from the ear along the same 
line as in Experiment IX. Require the subject to announce when 
he ceases to hear the ticking watch. Make three trials and average 
the results. Is the distance greater than in Experiment IX, A? 
Why ? 
B. Visual stimuli. Use the same cards as in Experiment IX, B. 
Let the subject first stand at a short distance from the card, and 
then move to a position where he fails (1) to recognize the mark, and 
(2) to perceive that there is any mark upon the sheet. Average 
the results of the trials with each of the five cards, and compare the 
two averages with those obtained in Experiment IX, B. 
The distance at which a threshold stimulus can be perceived and 
discriminated will be greater in this experiment than in Experi- 
ment IX. The sense organs of hearing and seeing, respectively, 
are adjusted to the actual stimulus, whereas through expectant 
attention they can be only imperfectly adjusted. Moreover, 
a continued perception is more effective in retaining the mental 
content received from a minimal stimulus than is preperception 
in assisting to form such content. To attend to a perception 
that is about to be received requires a memory image of what 
is expected and a general adjustment of the sense organ. To 
attend to an actual perception involves the activity of apper- 
ception and the perfect adaptation of the sense organ to the 
particular stimulus. Attention increases the mental result of a 
stimulus through apperception and the voluntary control of the 
muscles that take part in the adjustment of the sense organ.

EXPERIMENT XI. The relation of attention to apperception. 
A. Think of sheep jumping over a fence. How long can you 
keep your attention fixed on this mental picture? How do you 
bring your attention back to the image when it seems to turn to 
other ideas, perceptions, or sensations? How do you know that 
you are attending to the mental picture called for? 
B. Place a watch where you can readily hear it ticking. 
Attend exclusively to this sound for three minutes. Describe 
what took place in your mind during the period of attention, 
making particular note of the effect of distracting stimuli, possible 
sensations of strain in the ear, the position of the head, ete. 
C. Describe the order and character of the phenomena when 
your attention is suddenly directed to a very loud noise, a band of 
music, or other attractive stimuli. How is this involuntary atten- 
tion distinguished from the voluntary attention of A and B? 
The same mental content will, at different times, vary in 
distinctness and vividness. At any one moment some of the 
contents of consciousness will be more distinct and vivid, and 
others less so. A mental content which is distinguished from 
others by its greater vividness or distinctness is said to be 
attended to or to receive attention. A mental content is said to 
receive less attention when it loses somewhat in vividness and 
distinctness as other contents, from whatever cause, increase 
relatively in vividness. The number of contents that can receive 
attention is so limited, that a new perception necessarily dimin- 
ishes the attention or perceptual vividness of those already in 
mind, and may indeed be the cause of their dropping out of 
consciousness entirely. Maximal attention to any one mental 
content is not possible for a great length of time; even within 
short periods of time, attention fluctuates. The maximum of 
attention seems to be attained at intervals of two or three 
seconds ; the mental content, therefore, periodically waxes and 
wanes in vividness.
-P-A-G-E-55
  ATTENTION 29 
In the previous chapter, the existence of a perception was 
shown to be determined both by sensation and apperception. 
A fluctuation in the vividness of a perception may, therefore, be 
due to variations in either process. When attention is directed 
to an external object, the adjustment of the sense organ is an 
important factor in determining which of a number of stimuli 
shall receive attention. The adjustment of one organ inhibits 
or makes more difficult the adjustment of another organ for the 
reception of stimuli, and the adaptation of a sense organ for one 
stimulus will make it less capable of reacting to other stimuli. 
A stimulus may, therefore, produce a vivid perception merely 
because of its own intensity and the adequate adjustment of a 
‘sense organ. And yet, at times, even vigorous stimuli fail to 
dispossess the mind of perceptions and ideas, in themselves less 
attractive. Thus the scholar may “absent mindedly” (really 
through maximal attention) continue to work out a problem in 
mathematics despite the ringing of fire-bells, which would gain 
every boy’s attention. The perception of an external object 
with attention requires the contribution of apperception to be as 
vivid as possible. The content obtaining the most considerable 
or most vivid apperceptional contribution will be the one to 
receive most attention. In proportion to the vividness of apper- 
ception awakened by other stimuli, attention will be withdrawn 
or distracted from a given mental content, as, for example, the 
“sheep” or “watch.” Making strokes with the pen automati- 
cally will not be so distracting as writing words from dictation, 
reading, or performing some simple mathematical preblem. 
The most distracting stimuli will perhaps be music, or the 
reading of an emotional poem, because these make numerous 
and many-sided appeals to apperception and thereby receive 
the contribution necessary to form vivid perceptions. 
The various factors determining the formation of a percep- 
tion with attention are: (1) the relative intensity and mode of 
application of the stimulus ; (2) the adjustment of the sense 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
80 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
organ ; (8) preperceptions increasing the vividness of the per- 
ception with which they are associated; (4) emotional interest, 
including pleasure and pain, which also contributes to the 
vividness of associated contents; (5) apperception. 
All these factors are usually concerned, though in different 
degrees, in the production of attention. But, at times, one 
or another factor may have a preponderating influence. For 
example, a very loud noise acting upon the sense organ of 
hearing precludes choice. The adjustment of the sense organ 
follows directly upon the stimulus, which thus gains apper- 
ception and consequent attention of its own energy. Such a 
stimulus is said to be passively perceived, and its existence in 
consciousness with maximum vividness is the state of passive 
attention. If two or more stimuli of nearly equal attractiveness 
in themselves give rise to perceptions, choice is possible; the 
selection of the content to be given attention is then related 
neither to the sense organ nor to the stimulus, but to the apper- 
ceptional conditions described in previous experiments. The 
adjustment of the sense organ follows upon some controlling 
idea, memory image, or perception; a familiar asa of 
this is the turning of the head and eyes toward an object about 
which one may be talking or thinking. The conscious adjust- 
ment of a sense organ may be either voluntary or involuntary, 
depending upon the manner in which the conscious antecedent of 
the movement comes into mind. When a given mental content 
is retained in consciousness for some length of time, as, for 
example, the sound of the watch, the voluntary effort necessary 
to keep the sense organ adjusted to the particular stimulus is 
distinctly observed. The will is closely related to appercep- 
tion, because the production of a voluntary movement requires 
the apperception with great vividness of those ideas which 
initiate the various movements of the body. The attention which 
results directly from the selective activity of apperception is 
appropriately designated voluntary or active attention.

Experiment XII. The relation of attention to physiological 
adjustment. 
A. Stand before a mirror and cover both eyes with the hand. 
Remove the hand suddenly and look at the pupils. Observe that 
they are rapidly contracting. To observe this contraction in the 
eye of a subject, cover the eye for a few moments with the palm of 
the hand and then suddenly uncover; or bring a lighted match near 
to the subject’s eye; or slowly darken the eye by covering with the 
hand and observe the gradual change in the size of the pupil. 
B. Stand as before in front of a mirror at a distance of two feet; 
move the head slowly toward the mirror, keeping the gaze fixed 
upon the pupils. Observe that the pupils contract as the eyes 
approach the mirror and expand as they recede. 
To try this with a subject, hold up the forefinger of the right hand 
before the subject’s eyes, requiring him to fixate the finger. Move 
the finger toward the eyes until within a distance of a couple of 
inches, and then move it off to a distance of fifteen or twenty inches. 
The pupil will be seen to contract as the finger moves toward the 
eye and to expand as the finger moves away. Hold a book directly 
in front of the face of the subject at a distance of four inches, and 
another book at a distance of twenty inches. Observe that the 
pupils change in size as the subject’s gaze turns from one book 
to the other. 
This contraction and expansion of the pupil is called the 
pupillary reflec. The pupil is a cireular opening in the tris (the 
colored part of the visible eye), through which the rays of light 
pass to the interior of the eye-globe. The pupil appears black, 
because the observer is looking through a small opening into a 
dark inner chamber. The pupil is constantly changing in size, 
varying from one to eight millimetres in extreme diameters. 
The size of the pupil, and in consequence the amount of light 
admitted, is determined entirely by the size of the iris. This 
is controlled by two sets of muscle fibres, which are the essential 
structures of the iris. The radiating fibres are indicated in

of the cross-section of the iris. They radiate from the inner

contract, they pull the inner edge of the iris outward, along all 
its radii, and so contract the iris and enlarge the pupil. The 
small dots at the inner edge of the iris (see Diagram II) repre- 
sent the cross-section of fibres that extend in the form of a circle 
close to and about the inner edge. When these circular fibres
-P-A-G-E-59
  
ATTENTION 83 
contract, they draw the edge of the iris together, and thus expand 
the iris and contract the pupil. The size of the iris is regulated 
by these muscles in proportion to the amount of illumination 
and also with reference to the distance of the object for which 
the eye as an optical instrument is otherwise adjusted. The 
contraction and expansion of the pupil are not under voluntary, 
or even conscious, control. Thus a part of the external prepa- 
ration of the sense organ for the reception of a stimulus is a 
physiological reflec adjustment of the muscle fibres of the iris. 
C. Hold the forefinger of the right hand at a distance of two 
feet in front of the face. Keeping the gaze steadily fixed upon the 
finger, move it toward the eyes until it is within a distance of two 
or three inches. Do you notice a feeling of increasing strain from 
the eyes as the finger approaches the face ? 
The feeling of strain as the object moves nearer to the eyes 
is a kinaesthetic, or muscular, sensation. This arises from the 
contraction of the muscle of each eye which adjusts the lens to 
the distance of the object, and of the muscles controlling the 
position of the eyeball in its socket. 
The diagram on the opposite page represents the more impor- 
tant structures of the eye. The eyeball is nearly spherical and 
about one inch in diameter. It is covered in front by the deli- 
cate and transparent conjunctiva, which is a continuation of the 
skin of the eyelid. The eyeball proper is composed of an outer 
opaque elastic membrane, called the sclerotic (the white of the 
eye). In front, its place is taken by the transparent cornea, 
which protrudes like the crystal of a watch from the surface of 
the globe. The choroid membrane extends over most of the 
inner surface of the sclerotic (represented in the diagram by a 
heavy black line). Ata short distance from the junction of the 
sclerotic with the cornea, the choroid separates from the sclerotic 
and forms two processes, the iris to the front, and the ciliary
-P-A-G-E-60
34 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
processes or folds, which extend forward and toward the central 
axis of the globe to be connected with the suspensory ligament 
attached to the outer edge of the lens and holding it in its place. 
The sensitive portion of the eyeball is the retina, a thin mem- 
brane spread out over the inner surface of the choroid almost to 
the place of origin of the ciliary processes. The cavity between 
the cornea and the lens, the anterior chamber, is filled with 
aqueous humor; the posterior chamber, bounded by the lens, 
the suspensory ligament, the ciliary processes, and the retina, 
is filled with vitreous humor. The substance of the aqueous 
and vitreous humors is highly transparent. 
The adjustment of the sense organ of vision requires an 
accommodation, as it is called, of the lens to the distance of 
the object, so that rays of light coming from the object may be 
brought to a focus on the retina. This is accomplished through 
the ciliary muscle, which, as shown in the diagram, is made up 
in large part of fibres attached in front to the cornea, at its place 
of junction with the sclerotic, and behind to the choroid. As 
these fibres extend like a girdle or collar about the anterior 
and inner surface of the eye, they are called meridional fibres. 
The dots adjacent to the meridional fibres, but nearer to the 
lens, represent the cross-sections of circular fibres. When these 
two groups of ciliary fibres contract, they pull the anterior 
edge of the choroid together and forward. The lens is held 
in place by the suspensory ligament, which is attached to the 
ciliary processes of the choroid. The natural elasticity of the 
eye-globe exerts, through the ligament, a continuous outward 
pull upon the circular edge of the lens. When this tension 
is released, the lens hangs more freely in place, and, owing 
to its own elasticity, the anterior surface (to a small extent the 
posterior surface also) becomes more convex. The diagram 
represents the right half of the lens adjusted for near vision. 
This is accomplished by the contraction of the ciliary muscle, 
which releases the strain exerted by the ciliary processes and 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
    
    
    
         ATTENTION 85 
ligament upon the lens, thereby permitting it to assume its 
natural form of greatest convexity. The left half of the lens 
is represented as though adjusted for far vision. The ciliary 
muscle is not contracted, and the eye-globe exerts its tension 
outward through the ligament upon the lens, the lens in 
consequence being flattened. 
D. Fasten the gaze steadily upon the first finger of the left 
hand, which should be held directly before the face. With the gaze 
still fastened upon this finger, move the right hand, with the fore- 
finger extended, toward the left hand, beginning from a position to 
the right of the ear where it cannot be seen. Observe when the 
forefinger of the right hand is first seen as it crosses the edge of 
the field of vision. Move the finger of the right hand about and 
observe that it is more clearly distinguished at the border of the 
field of vision when moving than when at rest. 
Observe how close the two fingers must be brought together in 
order that both nails may be clearly distinguished. While the 
gaze is still fixed upon the forefinger of the left hand, attention 
may be directed either to the nail of the forefinger of the right 
hand or to the nail of the forefinger of the left hand. Without 
moving the eyes, give attention alternately to the two nails. 
Observe in all these experiments a difficulty in holding the eyes 
fixed upon the forefinger of the left hand, owing to what seems 
to be a tendency of the finger of the right hand to pull the eyes 
toward it. Do the movements of the eyes appear to be voluntary 
or involuntary at such times ? 
The innermost membrane of the eye-globe, the sensitive 
retina, extends, as shown in Diagram II, over more than one-half 
of the posterior inner surface of the globe. The retina is not 
equally thick in all portions, diminishing from .5 millimetre at 
the more posterior and central portion to .1 millimetre at the 
peripheral edge near the beginning of the ciliary processes. 
At the center of the retina is the macula lutea, or yellow spot, 
about one to two millimetres in diameter, in the center of which
-P-A-G-E-62
  36 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
is a depression, the fovea centralis, from .2 to .4 millimetre in 
diameter. All portions of the retina are not equally sensitive 
to light. From the fovea centralis, where the most distinct 
vision is attainable, the sensitivity of the retina diminishes

toward the peripheral edge. The retina is composed of several 
layers of different microscopic structures, represented in Dia- 
gram III. This diagram presents, without attempting to 
reproduce relative dimensions, a section of the posterior part 
of the globe, showing the sclerotic, the choroid, and the vari- 
ous layers of the retina. Proceeding from the choroid inward 
toward the center of the globe, there is found in order a layer of 
pigment cells, a layer of visual rods and cones, an outer nuclear 
layer, an outer molecular layer, an inner nuclear layer, an inner 
molecular layer, and a layer of large ganglion cells from which 
nerve fibres run, as the innermost layer of the retina, toward 
a point where they are collected into a single bundle of fibres 
which turns at right angles and breaks through all the layers 
of the retina, the choroid and sclerotic, to emerge from the eye- 
globe as the optic nerve. In all these layers, the only structures 
that appear to be directly stimulated by light are the pigment 
cells and the rods and cones. The rods are more numerous than 
the cones, except in the fovea centralis, where only cones are 
found. The fovea centralis is also marked by the absence of 
most of the other layers, from which results its characteristic 
pit-like appearance. The greater distinctness of vision from the 
fovea centralis seems to be due both to the presence of the cones 
and to the thinness of the inner layers. Rays of light can thus 
more effectively act upon the cones. The physiological excita- 
tion of the rods as well as of the cones is propagated from 
their inner branching terminals, through the bipolar cells of the 
inner nuclear layer, to the large ganglion cells, from which it 
is conducted by the fibres of the optic nerve to the brain. 
A stimulus will give rise to more distinct and intense sensa- 
tion if it acts upon the cones of the fovea centralis than if it 
acts upon the visual elements of more lateral portions of the 
retina, The more intense the process of sensation, the more 
likely is the stimulus to gain apperception and attention. The 
perception of an object acting upon the fovea centralis exceeds
-P-A-G-E-64
  38 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
so much in vividness the perceptions of objects acting upon 
other portions of the retina, that the latter perceptions are 
ignored, excepting under unusual conditions, and the former 
alone receives attention. When the rays of light coming from 
an object are focused 
within the fovea cen- 
tralis, a line passing 
from the fovea cen-

to the object is called 
the line of sight. To

The movement of 
the two eye-globes necessary to accomplish this result requires 
that the respective contrac- oe ria 
tions of twelve muscles be E ; Superior Rectus 
exactly proportioned and co- y : 
ordinated. Of the six muscles 
controlling the movements of 
each eye-globe, four are recti 
or straight muscles and two 
are oblique muscles. In Dia- 
gram IV is shown the superior 
rectus of the left eye, the ea- 
ternal and internal recti of 
both eyes, and the superior 
oblique muscles of both eyes. Diagram V represents the left 
eye with its external rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique, and ‘Inferior Rectus

  Diagram V. External lateral view of the

-P-A-G-E-65
  ATTENTION 39 
superior rectus. The contractions of these twelve muscles are 
so adjusted and coérdinated to one another that only certain 
movements are physiologically possible. 
Two important classes of eye movements are distinguishable : 
those of convergence and those of direction. When the gaze is 
fixed upon some object at a great distance, for example, 
on the horizon, the lines of sight are parallel, thus: | i 
To attend to nearer objects, the lines of 
sight must converge, thus: This is ac- 
complished by the two internal recti muscles chiefly. 
When the lines of sight are directed from an object 
near by to one farther away, the amount of convergence is 
decreased chiefly through the action of the external recti muscles. 
The entire set of twelve muscles is concerned in the steady fixa- 
tion of any object, no matter what its distance may be. Apart 
from movements of convergence, the eyes may sweep together 
over the field of vision from right to left and in the opposite 
direction, or they may move up and down, and thus direct the 
lines of sight upon any point within the field of vision. 
These movements of the eyes are under the control of the 
will, although they are generally accomplished without volition. 
The results of this experiment have shown that an object can 
be given continuous attention, for a time at least, despite the 
tendency of attractive visual stimuli to initiate, in a reflex way, 
the movements of the eyes necessary to gain for them exclu- 
sive possession of the vantage ground of the fovea centralis. 
The physiological adjustment of voluntary visual attention has 
appeared so significant to the human being that he has applied 
the expression “to direct attention” (which strictly means to 
direct the lines of sight of the eyes) by way of analogy, even to 
inner states of attention where no such adjustment of direction 
takes place. It is possible, with the eyes directed upon a finger, 
to give attention to another finger off to the side of the field 
of vision, without moving the eyes toward it. A “movement” ,
-P-A-G-E-66
  40 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
of visual attention is then accomplished without any movement 
of the eyes. Of course, attention does not strictly “move” in 
such cases. The feeling of movement connected with such 
inner direction of attention is due perhaps to slight movements 
of the eyes, which are checked before they have the chance to 
proceed very far, and also to other bodily movements normally 
associated with states of maximum attention. The brow may 
contract into a frown, the breathing, even the heart action and 
_ the flow of the blood may be somewhat affected. 
In giving attention to mental images connected with vision, 
actual movements of the eyes take place. Thus in trying to 
hold in mind the picture of sheep jumping over a fence, some 
strain from the eyes may be noticed, and even coérdinated 
movements, as the imaginary sheep leap the fence one by one. 
The turning of the head and eyes toward an object near at hand 
and about which one may be thinking has already been men- 
tioned. It is particularly difficult, also, to avoid moving the 
eyes toward an object that is seen, off to the side of the field of 
vision, out of the corner of one’s eye. The codrdination of the 
eye muscles seems to be “touch and go” with certain visual per- 
ceptions and memories. But despite this readiness of the eye 
muscles to follow the mental cue, it is not possible for voli- 
tion to bring about movements other than those for which the 
mechanism of the eye muscles is adapted. The lines of 
sight cannot be converged by unequal amounts, as, 
for example, nor yet can one eye be moved independ- 
ently of the other into such a position as this: 
The adjustment of attention is due in part to 
the inherited automatic mechanism, which is at 
the disposal of consciousness and will for the exe- 
cution of such movements as are in accord with its physio- 
logical nature. This automatic mechanism is also adapted 
to respond without volition, and perhaps even without con- 
sciousness, to stimuli acting upon the retina. It is, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-67
  
ATTENTION 41 
extremely difficult to distinguish in any particular case volun- 
tary from involuntary but conscious movements, and these 
from movements of the type exemplified by the pupillary 
reflex. It is possible, however, to distinguish different degrees 
of complexity in the muscular codrdinations involved in the 
physiological adjustment of attention. At any one moment of 
attention to visual perceptions, four types of muscular codrdina- 
tions will be represented. These are: (1) volitional codrdinations; 
(2) automatic codrdinations with consciousness ; (3) automatic 
codrdinations without consciousness, 7.e., complex physiologi- 
cal coérdinations; (4) simple physiological codrdinations, @.e., 
reflexes. The muscles that take part in this codrdinate adjust- 
ment are: (1) the iris, which regulates the number of rays 
permitted to act upon the retina; (2) the ciliary muscle, which 
accommodates the lens to the distance of an object and thereby 
accomplishes the same result as the photographer when he 
adjusts the ground glass of the camera to obtain clear defini- 
tion; (3) the six muscles of each eye-globe, which cause the 
lines of sight of the two eyes to be directed simultaneously 
upon the same external object. A complete explanation of 
the production of voluntary, automatic, and reflex movements 
is the task of physiological psychology. The purpose of an 
analytical psychology, in this connection, is restricted to the 
ascertainment of the various factors that give mental contents , 
the degree of vividness that distinguishes the state of attention. 
Although the stimuli themselves and the physiological mech- 
anism are important contributory factors, the will and the 
constitution of the individual mind play the chief part in deter- 
mining what each person shall make of his physical organism 
and of that common environment which supplies us all with 
the same raw materials of sensation. For this reason, we have 
considered the influence of certain individual mental charac- 
teristics embraced under the name of apperception, before pro- 
ceeding to treat of the association and combination of mental 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  42 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
contents and of their relation to the process of sensation and to 
the physical stimuli. 
Vision is chosen to illustrate the physiological adjustment of 
attention, because the muscular coérdinations of the eyes are 
of great variety and complexity, and attention to perceptions 
through the sense of sight is intimately connected with the 
development of attention in general. Attention to perceptions 
received through the sense of hearing requires a similar adjust- 
ment of the two muscles of the mechanical parts of the ear, the 
stapedius and tensor tympani (see page 168). The muscular 
adjustment necessary for attention to perceptions received 
through the sense of smell is shown in the sniffing up of the 
odoriferous air; for attention to perceptions through the sense 
of taste, in the crushing of a tastable substance against the roof 
of the mouth and in the movement of the tongue to spread a 
liquid over the sensitive regions of the mouth cavity; for 
attention to perceptions of touch, in the movement of the more 
sensitive portions of the body, for example, the hands, and 
particularly the finger tips, over the surface of an external 
object.

ASSOCIATION 
Experiment XIII. The perception of an object is modified by 
associated perceptions from adjacent objects. 
A. Size. 
1. Compare the circle a, Chart 8, surrounded by the smaller 
circles with the circle a’ surrounded by the larger circles. Which 
appears to be the larger circle, a or a'? They are both of the 
same diameter. 
2. Which appears to be the larger angle, b or b', Chart 8? 
They are exactly alike. 
3. Does ¢ or c! appear to be the larger section of the straight 
lines on Chart 8? They are of equal length. 
B. Color. 
1. Examine the charts numbered 9 to 14. Each chart com- 
prises a colored sheet, upon which is placed a gray strip, and over 
both a sheet of transparent paper. Compare the color and shade of 
the gray strips on the red, green, yellow, blue, white, and black sheets 
respectively, when covered with the transparent paper. Observe that 
the tinge of color is complementary to the color of the background. 
This tinge is noticeable even when the transparent paper is removed, 
so that it may be difficult to convince yourself that the six gray 
strips are identical in tint and shade: 
2. Arrange two lights of equal brightness, for example, two 
candles or two lamps, so that they will cast upon a white surface 
two similar shadows of a pencil interposed in an upright position. 
Place sheets of colored glass one after another before one of the 
lights, and compare the two shadows in each case. How is the 
shadow of the colored light affected ?

It would appear from these experiments that a perception of 
size or color, received from any object or part of an object, will 
depend in part upon other perceptions received at the same 
time from adjacent objects or adjacent parts of the same object. 
We may generalize from this fact and maintain that every 
sensation or perception will be modified, in some degree, by 
the sensations and perceptions associated with it. It has been 
suggested that the tinting of the gray strip or shadow in the 
color complementary to the background may be due to purely 
physiological processes in the retina. Although physiological 
processes doubtless contribute to the production of this illusion, 
the mental association of the perceptions themselves would 
appear sufficient to produce the result. A green background, 
for example, arouses an apperceptional expectancy for green in 
all parts of the visual field, in consequence of which a gray strip 
placed in the center of the green area is perceived as more 
removed from green than it really is. The color displacement 
of the gray strip is therefore in the direction of red, which is 
the contrasting complementary color sensation. This expla- 
nation is similar to that offered for the illusion of weight in 
Experiment VI, B. 
ExpreRIMENT XIV. The extension of associated perceptions over 
the invisible portion of the field of external objects. 
A. The blind spot of the retina. 
1. Fixate the cross on Chart 15 with the right eye, keeping the 
left eye closed and holding the chart close to the eye and in such 
position that the square, the triangle, and the large disc lie in a 
horizontal line to the right of the cross. Without moving the eye, 
you will be able to see the three figures. Move the chart slowly 
straight out from the eye. Ata distance of about seven inches the 
square will suddenly disappear. If it should come suddenly back 
again, this will be due to the fact that the eye has been moved . 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  46 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
rapidly toward it. In this case, bring the eye immediately back to 
the cross and hold the chart for some time in such position that the 
square cannot be seen at all, although the triangle and disc are 
clearly visible. Move the card slowly still farther out from the eye 
and you will find that at a distance of about eleven inches the 
square reappears and the triangle disappears. Move to a distance 
of sixteen inches and the large disc will have disappeared, although 
the other two figures will be plainly seen. Move the chart a few 
inches farther away and all the figures will be again visible. 
2. Invert the chart so that the cross is in a horizontal line to 
the right of the figures. Close the right eye and look steadily 
at the cross with the left eye. Proceeding as directed above, cause 
the square, triangle, and disc to disappear successively. 
When the eye fixates the cross, the image of the cross falls 
upon the fovea centralis. (See Diagram II.) If the chart is 
held close to the eye, the images of the square, triangle, and 
disc fall upon the lateral portions of the retina beyond the place 
of entrance of the optic nerve. The greater the distance of the 
chart from the eye, the nearer to the fovea will the three retinal 
images be situated. At certain distances ascertainable, as in this 
experiment, the image of each figure will fall entirely within 
the area from which the fibres of the optic nerve and the blood 
vessels supplying the inner structures of the eye are distributed 
over the inner surface of the retina. The result of this experi- 
ment shows that the fibres of the optic nerve are not directly 
sensitive to light, in consequence of which there is a blind spot 
of considerable area in each eye. In the right eye (see Dia- 
gram II) the blind spot is to the left of the fovea centralis, 
as is shown by the fact that objects to the right of the point 
fixated disappear. 
The diagram on page 48 represents the appearance of the 
retina of the left eye as viewed through the pupil. The ellip- 
tical white spot represents the fovea centralis and macula lutea; 
to the left of this is seen the blind spot, from the center of
-P-A-G-E-75

  48 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
which radiate the arteries and veins, avoiding the fovea cen- 
tralis. The fibers of the optic nerve are distributed in like 
manner. These are too fine to be represented in the diagram. 
The blind spot of both eyes is situated in the inner or nasal 
portion of the retina. In consequence, external objects cannot 
easily be observed to disappear when 
both eyes are open, and the rays of 
light from one and the same object 
are made to fall upon both blind spots. 
But two different objects are readily 
made to disappear by the method 
described in the next experiment. 
  3. Hold Chart 15 in such position 
Discram VI. A view of the that the word, the circle, and the tree 
ee a left eye through a1 in the same horizontal line. Fixate 
the circle with one eye at a time. Move 
the chart toward the face or away from it until you find the place 
at which the tree disappears with the left eye closed and the word 
“tree” disappears with the right eye closed. Be careful that the 
chart is not moved after this alternate flies pearance is obtained. 
Hold a narrow screen, such as a visiting card, directly between the 
root of the nose and the cross, so as to cut off the right eye’s image 
of the word and the left eye’s image of the tree. With both eyes 
open and directed upon the cross, the tree and word should now 
disappear from view; the image of the tree falls upon the blind 
spot of the right eye and is screened from the left, while the image 
of the word falls on the blind spot of the left eye and is screened 
from the right. 
Some difficulty may be experienced in getting the proper 
position of the head, chart, and screen, and in holding the eyes 
fixed upon the cross. Any displacement from the proper posi- 
tion will throw one or both images off the blind spot and thereby 
bring the objects clearly into view. A man or even a larger 
 
-P-A-G-E-77

  ASSOCIATION 49 
object may be made to disappear by screening one eye and 
seeking with the other the proper point in space to be fixated 
in order that the image of the man shall fall upon the blind 
spot. As the area of the blind spot is only from one-twelfth to 
one-fifteenth of an inch in diameter, the man must be far enough 
away to cause the retinal image to be small enough to fall within 
the area of the blind spot. The head of a man will fall entirely 
within this area at a distance of about six feet, and the whole 
body at a proportionately greater distance. 
B. The filling-out of the blind spot. 
1. In the preceding experiments, when the objects disappeared as 
they fell within the blind spot, what seemed to take their place? 
2. Fixate the cross on Chart 16 and hold the chart so that the 
uncolored portions of the red and green strips disappear. Do 
you see the red and green strips continued over the area not 
colored ? 
3. Fixate the circle on Chart 16 and move the chart until 
the central area where the red and green squares are mutilated 
falls within the area of the blind spot. Do the squares now appear 
intact and to meet at a common point? 
4. Cause the black disc between the interrupted circles on 
Chart 17 to disappear by fixating either one of the crosses, as 
may be convenient. Do you see the lines continued so as to make 
complete circles? Or do they appear as actually represented ? 
In the last experiment, the blind spot may be filled out by 
some persons with the white background of the paper, because 
the circles apparently are not distinctive enough to be continued 
as definite perceptions over the gap in sensation. Other per- 
sons will fill out the area with the associated perceptions of the 
circles. 
5. In what way is the central area of the checkerboard on 
Chart 17 filled out, when this falls upon the blind spot ?
-P-A-G-E-80
50 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
As the optic nerve itself is not sensitive to light rays, an 
object, or the part of an object, from which the light rays fall 
upon the blind spot, might just as well be behind the head, so 
far as its effect upon vision is concerned. This void is filled by 
the mind with the associated perceptions from adjacent objects 
that stimulate the parts of the retina surrounding the blind 
spot. The field of visual perception is therefore continuous, 
although the field of retinal excitation is interrupted and the 
field of external objects includes a portion from which no percep- 
tions are actually obtained. The field of vision is, in general, 
the aggregate of what can be and { seen at a single moment. 
In the study of vision, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish 
the mental or psychical field from the retinal or physiological 
field on the one hand, and from the ezternal or physical field on 
the other, for as is here shown the three fields do not always 
correspond. 
EXPERIMENT XV. The field of vision. 
A. The field of monocular vision. Let the subject close the left 
eye and, standing erect before the blackboard, with the head about 
eight inches from the board, fixate with the open eye some mark 
made with white chalk upon the board at the height of the eyes. 
Let the experimenter first hold a piece of chalk in position near the 
mark upon the board. While the subject continues to hold his 
eye fixed upon the mark, let the experimenter move the chalk 
horizontally, close to the surface of the blackboard, first to the right 
and then to the left, asking the subject in each case to announce 
as soon as the chalk disappears from view. Mark the points on 
the board at which the chalk seems to disappear. The distance 
of these points from the point of fixation will vary proportionately 
with the distance of the eye from the surface of the board. Toward 
the nose, it will be found that the chalk disappears suddenly. In 
the opposite direction, the subject may report that the chalk does 
not disappear at all.

The field of monocular vision will be found to be limited in 
the horizontal line internally by the nose, while externally it is 
limited only by the sensitivity of the retina to stimuli acting 
from a distance. 
Begin again with the chalk near the point of fixation and move 
it up and down in the vertical line, marking upon the board in a 
similar manner the points where the chalk disappears. The field of 
vision will be found to be limited in both directions. 
Connect all these points by a continuous line. This will be a 
rough outline of the external field of vision. The subject may find 
the limits of his own field of vision by fixating a point marked upon 
a sheet of paper placed on a table or against the wall. 
B. The field of binocular vision. Without changing the posi- 
tion of head and eyes, outline the field of vision of the left eye.

instructions of this experiment. The middle overlapping por- 
tion of the two fields is the field of binocular vision. Its out- 
line is an irregular ellipse. The farther the point fixated is 
from the eyes, the larger will be the area enclosed by the lines 
representing the limits of the field of vision.

ASSOCIATION \ 53 
C. The central area of distinct vision. 
1. Cut from a newspaper or other print a few clearly printed 
letters. Paste or otherwise fasten them to the end of a straw or 
pencil. Let the subject, with both eyes open, fixate a point on the 
blackboard or on a sheet of paper laid upon a table. Move a letter 
toward the point of fixation along vertical and horizontal lines, from 
the right, left, above, and below, beginning at a position where 
the letter cannot be seen. Require the subject to announce as 
soon as possible the letter seen. When he can correctly name the 
letter, mark the place upon the blackboard or paper. The line con- 
necting the four points thus determined will enclose a central area 
of distinct vision, which corresponds roughly to the retinal area of 
the fovea centralis. 
2. Fixate with both eyes any letter on this printed page, or a 
letter of the series on Chart 18, taking great care not to move the 
eyes. How many letters above and below, to the right and left of 
the letter fixated, can you see? How many letters beyond this 
area of distinct vision can you see dimly without being able to dis- 
tinguish the particular letter? How far from the point of fixation 
can you distinguish print ? 
The central area of distinct vision contains all those objects 
to which attention can be given without movement of the eyes. 
But attention cannot be given at one time to each and every 
object within this area. They are perceived with distinctness 
only by a successive direction, or movement, of attention to one 
object after another. When a letter to the right of the point 
fixated is clearly distinguished, a letter to the left becomes 
indistinguishable. As will appear from the results of the next 
experiment, only a small number of the objects within the area 
of distinct vision can be vividly and discretely perceived through 
a single act of attention. Physiologically, the area of distinct 
vision is the area of vision with the fovea centralis, and may be 
called the area of foveal or central vision. Psychologically, it 
is the area over which attention can be successively distributed
-P-A-G-E-84
  54 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
without movement of the eyes. It may therefore be called the 
field of visual attention with the eyes fixed. 
D. The field of attention with the moving eyes. Having deter- 
mined the central area of the binocular field, as above, move the 
eyes successively to a position as far as convenient vertically up 
and down and horizontally to the right and the left. Determine 
for each position, as directed in C, the point at which a letter can 
be named, and connect the four points with a line as before. 
The enclosed area is the field of visual perception with atten- 
tive eye movements. The eyes are moved over this field so 
rapidly, and for the most part so unconsciously, that all objects 
within the field are perceived distinctly and apparently simul- 
taneously. It is more extensive than the binocular field of dis- 
tinct vision with the eyes fixed in position, and is distinguished 
from the latter as the habitual or normal field of visual attention. 
The movements of the eyes are often accompanied by movements 
of the head. These are as unconsciously and almost as rapidly 
executed as the eye movements; they also serve to extend the 
limits of the field of visual attention. 
ExrreRIMENT XVI. The number of discrete perceptions associated 
in a single act of attention, and the combination of the associated com- 
ponent parts of a single perception. 
A. Simultaneous association. 
1. Cut from a sheet of paper or thin cardboard a rectangular 
slit 4 inch wide and 2} inches long. Let the experimenter place 
this sheet over the letters of a, Chart 18, so as to expose only the 
fifteen letters in a single horizontal line. Place the chart before a 
subject with the exposed letters in easy position for reading. Let 
the subject read aloud the letters thus exposed. Move the sheet so 
that a new line of letters is exposed. Do not let the subject see

these letters, using a piece of cardboard held just above the letters 
to screen them from his gaze. Direct the subject to prepare to 
read, as quickly as possible, the letters that will be exposed to view 
when the screening card is removed. Remove the card for a moment 
only, calling out “now” as a signal to the subject when the card is 
about to be removed. Require the subject to write down in order 
all the letters seen. Make in all ten trials, using a different line of 
letters on each trial. Be careful to keep the time of exposure as 
constant as possible. Record the number correctly seen at each 
trial and get the average number for the ten trials. 
2. Repeat this procedure with the short words of 6, Chart 18. 
Record the average number of short words and the average number 
of letters that can be seen as components of words. 
3. Repeat with Chart 19, a, recording as before the average 
number of words and letters. 
4. Repeat with Chart 19, b, recording the average number of 
words and letters that can be seen as components of sentences. 
5. Collate (that is, put together in a single table) the average 
results of 1, 2,3, and 4. Is it any more difficult to see a single 
word than it is to see a single letter? 
All of the objects that are contained within the external field 
of vision, and hence are able to act upon the sense organ, do 
not produce perceptions of equal definiteness and discreteness. 
Those objects which act upon the lateral portions of the retina 
can produce but vague and indefinite mental contents. Of 
these, psychology can say little more than that they exist and 
may, through a subsequent accession of vividness and distinct- 
ness, acquire a proportionately important place in consciousness. 
Nor yet do all the objects that may be contained within the 
area of distinct vision give rise to separate and discrete percep- 
tions. If the object of perception is a building, the several 
bricks of the building cannot give rise each to a distinctive 
perception. These are stimuli to the retina, the several mental 
results of which are very closely associated or combined in the 
single and unitary perception of the building.

  58 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
A word is a group of objects, é.¢., letters. At an early period 
of individual development, a perception of the whole word may 
not have been so readily formed as the perception of a com- 
ponent letter of the word. Through repeated experience, the 
discrete perceptions of letters combine with an ever-increasing 
degree of intimacy. Education makes possible an immediate 
synthesis of the mental results of the individual letters so as to 
form the combined but unitary perception of a word, and even 
the synthesis of words to form the unitary perception of a phrase 
or sentence. 
The following table collates a student’s results of the present 
experiment.

The time of exposure having been constant, the table shows 
that it takes as long to see three separate letters as it does to 
see 3.2 short words, 3.5 longer words, or 4.9 words connected 
inasentence. Words are perceived with about the same facility 
as are the single letters of which the words are composed. The 
table also shows that the short words thus simultaneously per- 
ceived comprise on the average 9.6 letters, the long words 17.5 
letters, and the sentences 18.1 letters. It would misstate these 
results to maintain that 9.6 letters, for example, can be perceived 
when they are the component parts of short words. When 
fifteen letters are simultaneously exposed to view, as in the 
experiment with Chart 18, a, three of these letters give rise 
each to a separate and distinct perception. The 9.6 letters are 
not perceived in like manner; they are the objects or stimuli 
which act together to give perceptions of 3.2 words. The
-P-A-G-E-89
ASSOCIATION 59 
  perception of a word requires one act of attention ; the percep- 
tion of a letter of the word requires another and different act of 
attention. In the first chapter, we saw that a perception is 
formed by the synthesis of a part which represents the results 
of former experience and a part which is the result of the 
stimulation of a sense organ. We now find that a perception is 
also a synthesis of a number of mental contents which are asso- 
ciated together through the simultaneous action of several 
stimuli. In this synthesis of the associated component parts of 
a perception, we recognize the same constructive activity of the 
mind that we then designated apperception. 
The number of discrete perceptions that can be associated in 
a single moment of attention and yet be separately distinguished 
is five, three or four certainly, six or seven doubtfully. This 
fact is ascertained by reducing the duration of the stimuli (the 
time of exposure) to a fraction of a second. The purpose of 
this is to prevent a movement of the eyes, and also the move- 
ment of attention, over the several objects of the field of vision. 
The number of discrete perceptions will then be limited to as 
many as can be associated in a single act or grasp of attention. 
It is shown that about five objects can be perceived as readily 
as one. These objects may be simple or complex ; for example, 
five letters or five words. As there is an ascertainable limit to 
the number of discrete perceptions associated in a single act of 
attention, so also is there a limit to the synthesis of mental 
contents associated in a single unitary perception. Most minds 
can grasp as a unit of perception the group of words compris- 
ing a phrase or short sentence. It is reported, though not 
yet proven, that some, with equal readiness, can apprehend 
groups of sentences as units of perception and thought. 
B. Successive association. 
1. Let the experimenter tap on the table with a pencil or any hard 
object at a constant rate of two or three taps to the second. Vary
-P-A-G-E-90
  60 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
the number of taps given in a single series from three to ten, and 
require the subjects, without counting, to write down the number of 
taps heard in each series. Make five experiments with each series. 
From the results of all the subjects, determine the average number 
of taps that can be held in mind as discrete perceptions. 
2. Let the subjects be prepared to receive words at dictation 
and let the experimenter dictate, from some simple prose selection, 
connected groups of words, requiring the subjects to write the 
words from memory after they have been dictated. Increase the 
number of words dictated at one time, until all, or nearly all, of 
the subjects find it impossible to write down correctly all the words 
received. Find in this way the average number of words that can 
be received at dictation. Observe that the number will vary with 
the relatedness of the words to one another, with the unity of the 
thought conveyed by the words, and with the interest in the 
matter dictated. 
A single act of attention may embrace several discrete per- 
ceptions that follow one another in sequence and which are 
then said to be successively associated. Five simple sounds, 
words, or other objects, represent approximately the maximum 
limit of this successive association of discrete perceptions. 
The component parts of a single perception may be succes- 
sively as well as simultaneously associated. It is a familiar 
experience that we immediately grasp as a unit of perception a 
number of words closely associated in succession. In hearing 
a passage read we do not get the sense word by word. We 
apprehend at once entire phrases and even sentences. Every 
perception is a synthesis, accomplished through apperception, 
of simultaneously and successively associated component parts. 
The experiments of this chapter have illustrated, hitherto, the 
association of uncombined and discrete mental contents. We 
shall now proceed to consider the simultaneous and suc- 
cessive association of mental contents comprised in a single 
perception.

ASSOCIATION 61 
Experiment XVII. A complete perception of an object involves 
a movement of the eyes and attention over the component parts of the 
object. 
A. Observe the three designs of Chart 20. Notice the incessant 
movement of the eyes over the lines of the designs. Do the eyes 
in attentive observation move from right to left or, in the reverse 
direction, from left to right ? 
It will be noticed by most subjects that the eyes follow with 
some attention the lines of the design from the left toward the 
right, returning from right to left with a hasty and inatten- 
tive movement. These designs are perceived by an attentive 
movement of the eyes, generally from left to right, over the 
prominent lines. This attentive exploitation of the design gives 
rise to a succession of associated partial perceptions which are 
combined in the complete perception of the object. 
B. 1. Observe the design a on Chart 21. Do you notice a 
tendency of the eyes to move from a point at the lower portion 
of the figure outward and upward over the curved elements of the 
design ? 
2. What are the movements of the eyes and attention over 6 and 
e of Chart 21? 
3. Why does the square ¢ appear taller than d? Observe care- 
fully the part of each square which first attracts attention. 
A prominent point or line of an object first receives atten- 
tion; from this the subsequent movements of the eyes and of 
attention will take their origin. Thus in Figs. a, 6, and e, 
Chart 21, the initial point of regard is near the base of the 
design, and attentive observation passes upward. The middle 
horizontal line of Fig. d, Chart 21, receives and holds attention, 
whereas some will fixate the base line and others the upper line 
of Fig. c. The point or line receiving initial attention is called  
-P-A-G-E-92
  62 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
the center of orientation, i.e., the part with reference to which 
the figure is “sized up” or given distinctive character. In an 
attentive examination of d, for example, the eyes move along 
the figure in the direction of the middle horizontal line; the 
square is thus divided into two equal rectangles, an upper and 
a lower. The subsequent movements of exploitation are then 
forced to pass over a series of parallel vertical lines. As each 
vertical line tends to hold the eyes fixed upon it, there results 
a momentary, even though unnoticeable, arrest of attention, 
whereby the time required to exploit horizontally is increased 
and the distance moved over by the eyes appears greater. With 
ec, on the other hand, the eyes do not move horizontally at all. 
The figure is exploited in the vertical direction, the eyes passing 
up and down along the vertical lines with unimpeded move- 
ments. Figure d is therefore oriented from the middle line as 
two rectangles, and exploited by horizontal movements of atten- 
tion, whereas c¢ is oriented as a single square and exploited 
vertically. This difference in the exploitation of the two equal 
squares gives rise to a difference in the associated components of 
the perceptions and thereby causes ¢ to appear taller than d. 
The associated partial perceptions which are synthetized to 
form the complete perception are obtained from successive move- 
ments of the eyes and attention over the parts of the object. 
The manner of this distribution of attention will determine the 
character and number of the component mental contents. To 
distinguish two different phases of this distribution of attention, 
the one from the other, and also to emphasize the fact that the 
perception of an object is not a single stable view but a succes- 
sion of views obtained from a movement of active attention, we 
have employed the term “orientation” to designate the attention 
to the dominant part or characteristic of the object, and the term 
“exploitation” to designate the attention given successively to 
the other parts. The latter are always apprehended in relation 
to the dominant part.
-P-A-G-E-93
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  64 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Exploitation may not always appear necessary to form a com- 
plete perception. An outline of a square, for example, may be 
perceived as a complete square, even when illuminated by the 
electric spark, which endures for too short a time to permit of a 
movement of the eyes over the lines of the figure. There is 
certainly, in this instance, no exploitation of the parts of the 
external object. There is, however, an exploitation of its visual 
image. A very small part of a square, even the word “square,” 
may suffice to call uy in mind the complete visual image of the 
square. This image is then contributed chiefly by the repro- 
ductive process of memory and not by sensation. It is exploited 
as the external object would have been had it acted for a longer 
time upon the eyes. 
Experiment XVIII. Habitual or normal modes of orientation 
and exploitation. 
A. 1. Compare the square a of Chart 22 with the diamond ¢ on 
the same chart. Do they not look like entirely different figures ? 
Are they not both squares? Which is the more pleasing figure ? 
The different appearance which these two figures present is 
due to their different orientation and exploitation. ‘The square 
is habitually oriented from the base line with movements of the 
eyes upward, as may be thus represented :   
I     
The dotted line indicates the line of orientation and the arrows 
the direction of exploitation. The diamond may be oriented 
from the lower point, with upward exploitation, thus : <>   
Frequently, however, the center of the diamond is taken as a 
point of orientation from which exploitation radiates by succes- 
sive movements outward, as may be indicated by the arrows, 
thus :
-P-A-G-E-95

-P-A-G-E-96
  66 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Some persons seem to divide the diamond into two symmetrical 
halves by an imaginary line of orientation, thus: 
What may be considered secondary movements of exploita- 
tion follow the outlines of the figures, moving usually in the 
direction of the hands of a clock, thus: inal Z4 S   
  
Inasmuch as the directions of the component lines of the two 
figures are entirely unlike, the movements of attentive regard 
differ radically in the exploitation of the two figures. Ditf- 
ferent muscular codrdinations and even different muscles are 
involved in the two cases, with the result that the two percep- 
tions are composed of very dissimilar component sensations   
and perceptions. The diamond will be instantly perceived 
as a square tilted up on a corner, if it is exploited in the 
same way as is the square, é.e., by a single movement of the 
eyes obliquely upward from a base line, thus : > 
2. Examine d, e, f of Chart 22. Although these are geometri- 
cally identical figures, does not d appear totally different from e and 
f? Indicate the orientation and exploitation of these figures by 
dotted lines. Which position of the figure do you prefer, as in e 
orin f? Does not e look somewhat “back-handed ” ? 
The figure, f, is exploited by an oblique line upward and to 
the right, whereas e is exploited by an oblique line upward and 
to the left. Movements of the eyes toward the right are more 
easily performed than those toward the left. The greater 
aesthetic value of f over e would seem to depend upon this 
relatively greater ease of eye movements to the right. If you 
imagine the figures e and f to be suspended from their upper 
lines, the upper line of each becomes the line of orientation from 
which the exploitation is obliquely downward. To such as can 
force themselves to regard the figures in this manner, f often 
appears less pleasing and more awkward when compared with e.
-P-A-G-E-97

-P-A-G-E-98
68 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
This is due to the fact that the exploiting movement of f is 
then to the left, while that of e is to the right. It would appear 
from these experiments that an exploiting movement is more 
habitual or natural upward than downward, and to the right 
than to the left. : 
3. How are the figures, a, 6, c, d, and e, of Chart 23, oriented 
and exploited ? 
The orienting line of the circle is its own circumference, and 
along it, also, exploitation takes place, rotating in the direction 
of the hands of a clock, as may be represented thus: (7 
ws 
This can be designated rotatory exploitation. There is also a 
tendency to move the eyes inward from the circumference 
toward the center, a convergent exploitation, indicated in the 
preceding diagram by the arrows pointing toward the center of 
the circle. A contrary divergent exploitation is also manifested 
moving outward from the center of the circle, thus: a 
In d and e, the center of the circle is clearly the center of ori- 
entation, from which the eyes are moved outward to the cir- 
cumference along the radii of the circle in what is a divergent 
radiating exploitation. Careful observation will show also a 
movement of the eyes and attention over the successive sectors 
of the figure and around the circumference. Ine, the horizontal 
line, as the line of orientation, divides the circle into two equal 
parts. Exploitation of this figure is consequently accomplished 
by equivalent movements above and below the horizontal line. 
The figure is therefore vertically symmetrical. In 6, the vertical 
diameter gives rise to equivalent exploitation to the right and 
left; the figure is therefore horizontally symmetrical. Figure d 
is variously symmetrical (of equal measure) ; the eye movements 
along the radii from the center outward are equal and similar, 
and in passing over the sectors by a rotatory exploitation, the
-P-A-G-E-99
ASSOCIATION 69 
eyes meet equal parts successively. The figure therefore pre- 
sents both a fourfold radiating and a fourfold rotatory symmetry. 
Figure e¢ similarly possesses an eightfold radiating and rotatory 
symmetry. The undivided circle, a, is often regarded as a per- 
fectly symmetrical figure, because every point of the circle is at 
an equal distance from its center. This view is not justified, 
because the exploitation of the circle by a continuous move- 
ment about its circumference does not present any equivalent 
movements whatever, nor any repetition of similar parts. The 
circle is therefore not a symmetrical figure, but a type of the 
perfectly unitary figure. The figures, 8, ¢, d, and e, are divided 
into varying numbers of similar parts. These figures are both 
unitary and symmetrical. 
B. Symmetry and proportion in the vertical and the horizontal 
line. 
1. Examine the eight vertical lines, divided into equal and un- 
equal parts by cross-bars, on Chart 23. Does any one of these eight 
figures present a more pleasing appearance than another? Which 
is least pleasing in appearance? Do you prefer the lines A, B, and 
C, in which the shorter portion is above the longer portion, to the 
lines F, G, and H, in which the shorter portion is below the longer ? 
The cross-bar of H divides the line into two equal parts. 
These parts, however, appear unequal, because of the normal 
overestimation of the upper part of a vertical line in comparison 
with the lower part. The cross-bar of D is so placed as to 
appear to most eyes to divide the line into two equal or sym- 
metrical portions. In the three lines, A, B, and C, the cross- 
bars are at different distances above the middle point of the 
lines. In F, G, and H, the cross-bars are below. At first sight, 
it seems impossible, if not absurd, to say that one line is more 
pleasing in appearance than another. Many persons, however, 
express a slight preference for a line with the cross-bar above 
the center, as, for example, the line C.
-P-A-G-E-100
  70 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
2. Invert the chart. Do you now prefer the cross-bar above 
or below the center of the line? Do you think of the lines as sus- 
pended from the upper end, or as standing upon the lower end? 
When you observe a line attentively, do you move the eyes from 
the bottom up or from the top down? 
When the eyes are moved with attention from the bottom 
up, the lines will appear to be standing. If your selection is 
restricted to lines divided into unequal parts, a line with the 
cross-bar above the center will generally have a slight prefer- 
ence. When the eyes are moved from the top down, the lines 
will appear to be suspended. A line with the cross-bar below 
the center will then be preferred. In moving the eyes over 
unequal parts of a line, it is more pleasing to pass from a 
longer to a shorter section than from a shorter to a longer. It 
would be absurd to assert that any one of the lines on the 
chart is beautiful or has great aesthetic value. Nevertheless, 
even a very slight preference for one mode of dividing a line 
may grow into a decided opinion of the beauty or ugliness of 
an object, if that object forces upon our attention, along with 
its other characteristics, an arrangement of unequal and equal 
parts. We learn from a study of the relative aesthetic effect 
of these simple lines, that the natural exploitation of vertical 
distances is upward, unless something in the figure or some 
association causes the eyes and the attention to begin the move- 
ment of exploitation at the upper end. 
38. Turn the chart so that the lines are horizontal. The line E 
will now appear to be equally divided. There is little or no over- 
estimation of the part of a line to the right relative to the part to 
the left. Do you find that the symmetrical division is much more 
pleasing when the line is horizontal than when it is vertical ? 
4. Compare C and E in the horizontal position, and C and D in 
the vertical position. Is the symmetrically divided line certainly 
the most pleasing of all, when the lines are in the horizontal

    72 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
position? Are you in doubt as to the relative merits of the equal 
and unequal divisions in the vertical position, perhaps inclining to 
prefer the unequal division ? 
To exploit a horizontal line, the eyes seize first upon a middle 
point or portion of the line and then seek to make equal 
movements to the right and left. This is in accordance with 
the anatomical relations of the eyes and their twelve muscles, 
and also with the normal habits of vision developed by the 
environment. When attention is fixed on objects straight before 
us, or on the ground at some distance, we are in position to 
make movements of the eyes equally to the right and to the 
left. Movements downward, however, are limited in extent 
and unimportant compared with movements upward, as, for 
example, the raising of the eyes from the ground to view a 
tree or building. 
In consequence of these conditions, dual symmetry has greater 
aesthetic value in the horizontal than in the vertical line. Hori- 
/ zontal dual symmetry is commonly known as bilateral symmetry. 
It is found in almost every work of art, and indeed in many 
objects of nature, for example, the human body. 
5. Compare A, B, and C in the vertical position. Which of the 
three unequal divisions do you prefer ? 
Most persons prefer C, or some approximate division of the 
line. } 
When the cross-bar stands at the middle point of a line, the 
line is divided into two equal parts and the ratio of the lengths 
of the two parts can be expressed as 1:1, no matter what the 
actual length of the line may be. Suppose the cross-bar to be 
moved gradually toward the upper extremity. As the upper 
part becomes smaller and the lower part larger, the ratio between 
the upper and lower parts will change at certain intervals from 
that of 1:1 to one of 1:14, 1:2, 1:8, etc. At one end of the
-P-A-G-E-103
ASSOCIATION 73 
series we shall have a pleasing equality of parts, and at the 
other a very displeasing inequality of parts. Is there a pleasing 
inequality of parts? Experimentation and the practice of the 
arts have answered this question in the affirmative. When 
the ratio between the parts is about that of 3:5, or 1:1.66+, 
the line will produce a pleasing effect. This ratio is nearly 
that of C and #' on the chart. Some will prefer a line in which 
there is a greater difference between the two parts, and others 
will choose one in which there is a less amount of difference. 
The majority of persons, however, will select a division of the 
line in which the ratio of the two parts is approximately that 
of 8:5. A pleasing inequality of the parts of a line, the ratio 
of 3:5 or any other preferred ratio, we maycall proportion, to 
distinguish it from the pleasing equality of parts, which has 
been designated symmetry. 
Suppose that we try to divide the line in such manner that 
the ratio between the shorter and longer parts of the line 
is the same as the ratio between the longer part of the. line 
and the whole line. If the length of the shorter section is x 
and the length of the longer section is y, then this division 
requires that e:y=y:r+y. This division of the line is 
known as the golden section. A line cannot be divided exactly 
in accordance with the requirements of the golden section. It 
can be shown by mathematical calculation that if the length 
of the shorter part is 1, the length of the longer part must be 
1.618+, a quantity the exact value of which cannot be deter- 
mined. In (, the ratio of the parts is 83:5, or 1:1.66+. The 
most pleasing “ proportion” would seem to be an approxima- 
tion to the golden section. It has been held that this « pro- 
portion” is pleasing because it gives to a figure an equality 
of ratios, z.e., that of the shorter and longer parts on the one 
hand, and of the longer part and the whole line on the other. 
It was also maintained that a more cultivated aesthetic taste 
would prefer proportion to symmetry, because of the more  
-P-A-G-E-104
  14 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
complicated equality presented by the golden section. It seems 
to be true that the development of taste leads to a preference 
of proportion to symmetry, especially in the vertical direction. 
But the cause of this is not the demand for an equality of 
ratios, but a demand merely for greater variety. Symmetrical 
figures are divided into parts monotonously alike ; proportional 
figures have their parts unlike. The amount of unlikeness or 
variety that is pleasing will depend upon the general character 
of the object, and upon the individual’s grade of intelligence 
and aesthetic taste. The ratio of “proportion” is not fixed as 
is that of symmetry. It is only as a very rough approximation 
that the ratio of 3:5 can be said to represent the most pleasing 
mean between a too great inequality or variety and a too great 
equality or sameness. 
In comparing these different lines to determine which is the 
most pleasing proportion between the parts of a line, many will 
find it difficult to avoid associations with swords, daggers, tele- 
graph poles, trees, and crosses. Indeed, some are inclined to 
think at first that it is these associations, and not the propor- 
tion, which are the chief source of the greater or less aesthetic 
value ascribed to the several figures. That the human mind 
manifests an aesthetic appreciation of proportion in the ertical 
line is shown in the historical development of the form of the 
cross of Christian art. The cross was originally T-shaped, or 
had the cross-bar very high up on the vertical (see a and 6, 
Chart 24). In early forms of the cross (6 is from the catacombs 
of S. Ponziano and dates from the fourth century or earlier), 
the cross-bar has a higher position than it occupies on the two 
crosses, ¢ and d, of Chart 24, the former being a cross used 
for personal ornament and the latter an ecclesiastical cross 
of the fifteenth century. As the historic symbol was adapted 
for church and personal ornament, the cross-bar dropped down 
in the course of centuries to satisfy an aesthetic demand for 
proportion in the vertical line.

C. Symmetry and proportion in complex figures. Compare 
Figs. a and 6 on Chart 22, opposite page 66. Which do you prefer 
as a figure, the rectangle or the square ? 
Most persons prefer the rectangle to the square, though not 
a few find the square the more pleasing. The four sides of the 
square are of the same length, whereas the vertical magnitude 
of the rectangle is in the ratio of 3:5 with the horizontal. The 
square is therefore completely symmetrical, the rectangle being 
proportional, although not entirely without symmetry. The 
square is pleasing because of the equality of all its parts; the 
rectangle is more pleasing because it affords a greater variety 
of partial perceptions. Experiments in aesthetics as well as 
experience with the forms of art show that proportion between 
vertical and horizontal magnitudes is preferred to symmetry. 
This aesthetic demand determines to some extent the forms of 
books, envelopes, windows, picture frames, and many other 
objects of the useful and the fine arts. 
We have learned from the results of the preceding experi- 
ments that the perception of an object is obtained by associating 
together many partial perceptions of the object. The manner 
in which these component parts are combined in the complete 
perception will depend in part upon the constructional elements 
of the object itself. But toa much greater degree will a particu- 
lar combination be determined by universal or individual habits 
of distributing attention over the parts of the object. These 
habits of attention are, in the last analysis, habits of appercep- 
tion. The movement of active attention, as appeared from the 
experiments of Chapter II, is the result of an acquired tend- 
ency to select the particular objects, or parts of an object, to 
be given vivid mental existence. A simple or complex work of 
art will produce the desired aesthetic effect only when some 
measure of conformity to these apperceptional habits is realized. 
If an object is to be perceived with aesthetic pleasure, all its
-P-A-G-E-107
  ASSOCIATION UT 
parts must be apprehended with distinctness and yet in combi- 
nation; and this must be accomplished with readiness and ease. 
We do not mean by this that the object which we perceive most 
easily will give us the greatest amount of aesthetic pleasure. 
The cultivation of aesthetic taste is a training to perceive pro- 
gressively more complex things with the maximum of ease. 
The development of apperception facilitates the combination 
of the component parts of complex perceptions. Insufficient 
training causes one person to view a thing of beauty with 
indifference, because he will see it as a simple thing or he will 
see only a part of it; another person will view it with distress- 
ing effort or even with mental confusion, because he has not 
acquired adequate facility in constructing the complete percep- 
tion of a complex object. A few simple illustrations drawn 
from the visual arts will demonstrate this dependence of 
aesthetic perception upon the apperceptional habits manifested 
in the distribution of attention. 
A movement of the eyes and attention upward is preferred 
to alike movement downward. The actual movement enforced 
by the construction of the designs, Figs. a, 6, and e, on Chart 21, 
is upward. The designs appeal to the habitual mode of exploi- 
tation. If the chart is inverted, exploitation will be forced by 
the designs to follow a downward direction. The designs have 
a much more pleasing aesthetic effect if they are viewed as 
placed upon the chart than if inverted. 
The aesthetic value of bilateral symmetry, which was shown 
to depend upon the natural mode of orienting and exploiting 
horizontal lines, is well established. The employment of propor- 
tion in the vertical direction, in preference to dual symmetry, was 
illustrated by the cross of Christian art. Figure a of Chart 25 
possesses both horizontal and vertical symmetry, and between 
the horizontal and vertical elements there is the characteristic 
proportion to which attention was called in the simpler figure 
of the rectangle.
-P-A-G-E-108
    78 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Decorative art occasionally employs designs that do not con- 
form to the general tendencies of natural exploitation. These 
exceptions, on careful examination, often show that the decora- 
tion has suggested some unusual exploitation, which, for the 
time being, is substituted for the more natural one. Thus 
Fig. 6, Chart 25, is a decorative hinge for a door. Its form 
as well as its position on the door will suggest movements of 
the eyes in the horizontal direction from left to right rather 
than the more usual exploitation from the center with equiva- 
lent movements to the right and left. In consequence of this 
suggested exploitation, it is not displeasing to find proportion 
in the horizontal and symmetry in the vertical direction. 
It was also demonstrated that, in the exploitation of hori- 
zontal lines, a movement from left to right is preferred to 
one in the opposite direction. This is beautifully illustrated 
in Fig. ¢ of Chart 25, which contains, in addition to the dual 
symmetry of the figures in the lower part of the design and 
to the right and left, a middle portion not bilaterally sym- 
metrical. This central design possesses what may be called 
running symmetry, the same element being repeated five and a 
half times. Attention moves over this design from left to right 
more readily than from right to left. 
Radiating symmetry is frequently employed in decorative 
art. It is the basis of construction of the Greek cross, which 
in its simplest form is composed merely of four equal arms 
radiating at right angles from a center (Fig. d, Chart 25). A 
simple treatment of this variety of radiating symmetry is to be 
found in the cross from the church of St. Sophia (Fig. e, Chart 
25). The radiating design (Fig. a, Chart 26) presents a more 
complicated treatment, each of the four members or elements 
being composed of three sub-elements having dual symmetry. 
Another example of Byzantine decoration (Fig. 6, Chart 26) 
presents a different treatment of the same characteristic design. 
In this there are two groups of four symmetrical elements
-P-A-G-E-109
  
      
  
            
  Cuart 25
-P-A-G-E-110
  80 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
radiating from a common center, the four elements of the 
two groups alternating. The design from St. Mark’s (Fig. d 
on the same chart) develops the two groups of four radiating 
elements from simple elements presenting both dual symmetry 
and proportion. A design of the Renaissance period (Fig. e, 
Chart 26) limits the number of radiating elements to two 
groups of three each, developed from component elements of 
complicated but generally symmetrical construction. Radiat- 
ing designs which contain an even number of elements, four, 
six, eight, and so on, such as Figs. a, }, d, and e of Chart 26, , 
always possess dual symmetry as well as radiating symmetry ; 
but radial designs composed of an odd number of elements, for 
example, Fig. c, do not possess such dual symmetry. 
The number of radiating elements may be indefinitely large. 
In Fig. f of Chart 26 there are fifteen elements, presenting a 
beautiful and complex variety of manifold radiating symmetry. 
The eyes exploit this design also with a circular movement. 
In doing so, they pass in succession over symmetrical parts of 
the design, giving rise to a manifold rotatory symmetry. The 
manner in which rotatory exploitation may be suggested by 
some very simple feature is shown in the representation of a 
part of a stained glass window from the Soissons cathedral. 
This design (Fig. e, Chart 26) possesses a fourfold radiating 
symmetry in two groups of four elements, but the four ele- 
ments near the periphery draw attention from the center, and 
their form causes the eyes to move about the border of the 
design. Rotatory exploitation is very marked in the detail of 
a piece of French sculpture portrayed as Fig. a of Chart 27. 
Careful examination of the complicated design (Fig. 6 of 
Chart 27) will disclose illustrations of many different kinds 
of symmetry. The design seems to have what may be called 
“movement,” because the most prominent part of the design 
is composed of the six complicated elements which continually 
attract the eyes to move over them, as though in a restless

  82 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
search for some point of fixation. The figure has a dominant 
rotatory symmetry. But it possesses also manifold radiating 
symmetry, because the eyes in moving outward from the 
center will pass over equivalent elements of design. It also 
possesses manifold dual symmetry, for if a straight line were 
drawn entirely across the figure through the center, similar 
elements would be found along this line at equal distances and 
in opposite directions from the center. If the larger elements 
of the design are studied to ascertain the forms of symmetry 
employed in their construction, it will be found that they all, 
despite their complicated character, fall within the classes and 
types which have been described above. The constructive 
elements of this design are developed in such a complicated 
manner, that the figure inspires but never gratifies the effort 
to apperceive a fixed relation of its parts. 
It has been stated that proportion is more pleasing than sym- 
metry because it possesses greater variety. It is also suscepti- 
ble of more complex treatment. Designs combining proportion 
and symmetry are not so readily apperceived and in consequence 
appeal to a more highly developed aesthetic sense. In church 
edifices, the historical development of architecture is shown to 
be away from symmetrical forms of dominant horizontal lines 
to the more complex forms of proportion in dominant vertical 
lines. Thus the Greek temple employed the simplest kind of 
symmetry. The early Christian church, modified from the 
Roman basilica, developed a more complicated treatment of sym- 
metry, but still used dominant horizontal lines. The cathedral 
of Cologne, a magnificent example of Gothic art, is marked by 
dominant vertical lines of exploitation and a more pronounced 
use of proportion. 
Pictorial art exemplifies the same general rules. In the 
celebrated painting by Raphael, the Sistine Madonna (Chart 28), 
the figure of the Virgin first attracts and holds attention. The 
picture being thus oriented along the central vertical line, the
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  Cuarr 27
-P-A-G-E-114
  84 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
position of the two figures to the right and left gives, in the 
horizontal direction, an evident bilateral symmetry. In the 
vertical direction, however, there is not the least suggestion of 
symmetry, but in its stead a noticeable proportion between the 
two kneeling figures and the standing Madonna. A conspic- 
uous tendency appears in the course of the development of 
pictorial art to employ, even in the horizontal direction, the 
proportional relation in preference to symmetry. 
In unsymmetrical paintings, the center of orientation is 
most frequently in parts to the left, and the movement of 
exploitation is from left to right. This characteristic exploi- 
tation is shown in one of the oldest works of art, the 
Wounded Lioness (Chart 29), which dates from the seventh cen- 
tury before the Christian era. The center of initial regard is 
undoubtedly the head of the lioness. The eyes view the figure 
by passing down the sloping body of the lioness in one of the 
most pleasing lines of movement in the visual field. The 
famous Aurora of Guido Reni (Chart 29), also, requires 
orientation in the left of the picture and exploitation toward 
the right. The chariot and the figures about it attract atten- 
tion first, and from them the eyes move to the right and up- 
ward in a graceful curve. This curve is repeated, though not 
always in the same position, in a number of figures, particu- 
larly in the Cupid with the extended horn and in the figure 
nearest to the horses. The curved line extending from the 
foot and draped right leg to the head is practically the same as 
the dominant line of the painting. If the illustrations of any 
book are examined, they will be found more frequently to 
require movements of the eyes from left to right than in the 
opposite direction. 
The exploiting movements of the eyes may be suggested by 
the figures of a painting. Thus the cherubs in the Sistine 
Madonna are gazing upward to the right. In looking at this 
picture, it is almost impossible to keep the eyes from following

ASSOCIATION 85 
the gaze of the cherubs. An object in that direction will be 
observed long before the hands and arms of the cherubs are 
seen. This picture may be examined by some persons for a 
considerable length of time before they take the slightest notice 
of the hands ; this may be proved by removing the picture from 
view and asking for details as to the number and position of 
the hands represented. The larger figures of the picture also 
suggest lines of direction for the movement of attention. 
Thus the figure to the right is looking downward toward 
the cherubs, that toward the left is gazing up into the face 
of the Madonna, while the direct gaze of the Madonna draws 
attention to the middle portion of the picture. In this, as in 
many pictures, the unity of the scene is largely enhanced by 
the skillful arrangement of the lines of sight of the figures 
portrayed. 
It is not possible to discuss at this time the aesthetic value 
of different curved lines. Neither psychology nor aesthetic 
criticism has reached a position of great certainty with regard 
to the more pleasing forms of such lines. Hogarth’s serpentine 
line of beauty is constructed by tracing a spiral line of a single 
turn upon the surface of a cone from its apex to its base. The 
form of this curve will depend upon the relative dimensions of 
the height of the cone and the diameter of its base. Hogarth was 
not able to establish these proportions more definitely than to 
assert that the cone must be neither too tall nor too short. Noth- 
ing more definite can be maintained than that gradual curves 
are more pleasing than abrupt ones. In general, curved lines 
have greater aesthetic value than straight lines. A gradual 
curve upward to the right, the dominant curve of the Aurora, 
is perhaps the most pleasing line. It is also the line that best 
accords with the relative ease of natural and acquired move- 
ments of attention. Next in order is a curved line downward 
and to the right. Following this in ease of exploitation and 
in aesthetic value is a curved line upward and to the left. A  
-P-A-G-E-118
  
86 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
line downward and to the left satisfies least the requirements 
of apperception and aesthetic appreciation. 
In this treatment of the elements of visual forms, only the 
simplest conditions of aesthetic perception have been considered. 
Other aesthetic demands will of necessity modify and may even 
completely antagonize those which have been here presented. 
It would be absurd to look for the employment and realization 
of these apperceptional motives in every work of art or nature 
that appeals to the sense of beauty. It is maintained, only, that 
these factors will be found along with others that contribute 
to the perceptions of such objects as awaken the responsive 
emotion of aesthetic appreciation. 
Experiment XIX. Visual illusions of space. 
A. Linear dimensions and areas. 
1. Compare the apparent lengths of the horizontal lines on 
Chart 30. In which figures does the horizontal line appear longest? 
In which does it appear shortest ? 
These lines are all of the same length. The horizontal lines in 
those figures which cause attention to be directed inward from 
the ends of the line, are apparently contracted and shortened 
when compared with lines of the same length in figures that 
compel attention to move outward from the ends of the line. 
2. Do the horizontal lines of the defective squares, a and , on 
Chart 31, appear to be longer than the vertical lines ? 
These figures are exploited by a movement of attention over 
their constituent lines. The eyes and attention slip off the 
ends of the horizontal lines, and thereby extend the exploita- 
tion of the figures outward to the right and left respectively. 
The unrestricted and really greater movement to the right and
-P-A-G-E-119

-P-A-G-E-120
    88 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
left increases the apparent length of the horizontal lines, when 
these are compared with the vertical lines. On close examina- 
tion, the horizontal lines give oftentimes a fleeting impression of 
being not exactly parallel. At one end, they are held or pulled 
together by the concentration of attention on the vertical lines ; 
at the other end, they are separated by the divergent movement 
of attention toward the extended area beyond the figures. It 
is even observed by some that the horizontals of 6 appear to be 
longer than those of a. The area toward which attention is 
directed is much larger in 6 than in a, owing to the position of 
the two figures on the chart. 
Some subjects will not see the illusions just described. Some 
will report illusions even in the opposite direction. This holds 
true of nearly all the illusions considered in this section of 
the Manual. It is to be expected that different persons will 
view these figures in different ways. Although a figure may 
be so drawn as to force the attention of most subjects to the 
parts desired, some will, nevertheless, distribute attention in 
accordance with individual habits of apperception. 
3. How do the three circles a, 6, and ¢ on Chart 31 compare in 
apparent size ? 
These circles are all of the same diameter, although a appears 
to be larger than 8, and 6 larger than ec. In comparing circle ¢ 
with circle a, ¢ is viewed as a part of the broad area vaguely 
defined by the diverging lines of the angle. On the other hand, 
a stands out in consciousness with distinctness, attention being 
drawn to its center by the lines converging to the apex of the 
angle. It was shown on page 68 that the circle is habitually 
exploited by movements around its circumference and inward 
toward the center. This will cause an apparent contraction of 
the circle when compared with figures that are exploited from 
the center outward. Circle ¢ receives this natural exploitation ;
-P-A-G-E-121
Cuart 31
-P-A-G-E-122
  90 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
circle a, however, is exploited outward toward the circumference 
from its center, to which initial attention is forced by the apex 
of the angle. Circle 6 is probably exploited only around its cir- 
cumference. Its area is associated with the small area enclosed 
within the converging lines of the angle. Contrast between 
the associated areas to which the two circles are respectively 
referred causes 6 to appear larger than ec. Different modes of 
exploitation, however, cause a to appear larger than either 
6 or e. : 
4, Take three small coins, — pennies, for example. Place two 
of them on the table just far enough apart to permit of passing the 
third coin between them, but adjust the two coins without trial with 
the third coin. Place the third coin between the other two. Did 
you leave sufficient space? When the middle coin is removed 
after being in line between the other two, does the space which it 
has just occupied appear to be more than sufficient to contain the 
coin ? 
The coin is bounded by a circular line. Areas with circular 
boundaries appear to be smaller than equally extensive areas 
having any other form of boundary. The convergent exploita- 
tion of a circular area will cause the two coins on the table to 
appear small in comparison with the area between them. The 
boundaries of the latter area are only partially defined by the 
outer convex lines of the coins; in consequence, this area is 
given more extensive and divergent exploitation, resulting in 
the apparent increase of its relative dimensions. 
5. Compare the trapezoids ¢ and c' on Chart 32. Which appears 
the larger? Why ? 
6. Which of the two equal lines appears to be the longer, — the 
upper horizontal line of d or the lower horizontal of d'? Why? 
7. Which is the broader rectangle, a or a’, on Chart 32?

In all the foregoing figures, the effect of contrast is increased 
by movements of the eyes and attention, enforced by the lines 
of the figures. 
B. Filled and unfilled space. 
1. Compare the six equal linear magnitudes, represented in a, d, 
and ¢ on Chart 33 by an empty stretch, a series of dots, a straight 
line, and a line with cross-bars. 
The unfilled stretch appears to be the shortest, and the line 
with the cross-bars or the line of dots the longest. This over- 
estimation of filled as compared with unfilled space is partly 
due to the relative difficulty and interruption of the eye 
movements of attentive exploitation. But the physiological 
processes of the retina also contribute to the illusion. A line 
of dots will cause a greater physiological excitation of the 
retina than an equal stretch of space limited by two dots as 
terminals. The effect of physiological processes upon percep- 
tion will be considered in Chapter V. A. similar illusion is 
found in space-perceptions received through the sense of touch 
(see page 154), under conditions that exclude movements as 
contributory factors. 
2. Why does the filled right angle of Fig. d, Chart 33, appear 
larger than the unfilled angle? 
C. The overestimation of vertical compared with horizontal dis- 
tance. Observe the apparent lengths of the vertical and horizontal 
lines in e and f. 
These lines are all of the same length. Eye movements 
in the vertical direction are performed with greater difficulty 
than in the horizontal direction. For this reason also a perfect 
square always appears taller than it is broad. (See Fig. a of 
Chart 22, opposite page 66.)

D. The overestimation of the upper as compared with the lower 
part of a vertical line. Draw a line of any length, say four inches ; 
hold the line vertical before the eyes; without changing the posi- 
tion of the line with reference to the eyes, divide the line by a 
cross-bar into two apparently equal parts. Invert the line. Do 
the parts now appear equal ? 
This illusion is probably due to an increasing difficulty in the 
movement of the eyes as they pass upward from the point of 
initial regard at the base of the line. 
E. Distortion and displacement. 
1. Does the square on Chart 31, opposite page 88, appear to be 
drawn up obliquely in the direction of the line extending from its 
upper right-hand corner? Why ? 
2. Compare the two semicircles, a and a’, on Chart 34. Why 
does a' appear to be a portion of a larger circle than a, and why 
does the distance between the free ends of the curved line appear 
to be greater than the diameter of a? 
38. Observe in Figs. 6 and 6! a similar but greater distortion of 
the equal arcs of similar circles. 
4. Do the small disconnected arcs of the circles ¢ and c' appear 
to be in what would be the continued line of the circumference of 
the circles? Why ? 
5. Are the three dashes of Fig. a on Chart 35 exactly in line 
with the lower lines of the two pairs of parallels ? 
6. When Chart 35 is held so that the lines of Fig. 6 are hori- 
zontal, the line to the left is clearly the continuation of the middle 
line of the three parallel lines. Turn the chart so that the three 
lines to the right are directed obliquely downward. ‘Does the single 
line then appear to be the continuation of the upper line of the 
parallels ? Turn the chart so that the three lines are directed 
obliquely upward. Of which of the three parallels is the single 
line the apparent continuation ? 
7. Which of the dots of Fig. ¢ on Chart 35 seems to be in a 
straight line with the continuation of the oblique line? Lay the

straight edge of a card to the oblique line and find where the oblique 
would actually cut the line of dots. 
8. Do the two oblique lines of Fig. d, Chart 35, appear to be in the 
same straight line or does one oblique line appear to be higher than 
the apparent continuation of the other oblique line? Are the three 
oblique lines of Fig. e in the same straight line? Turn the chart 
so that the oblique lines of Figs. d and e are horizontal. Does the 
illusion disappear entirely or only in part? Does the illusion 
disappear when the broken lines are vertical? Observe the three 
pairs of oblique lines in Fig. f, Chart 35. Is the illusion greatest 
with the shortest lines ? 
9. What cause can you assign for the distortion of the two 
parallel vertical lines of Fig. g, Chart 35? 
10. Why are the oblique parallel lines on Chart 36 no longer 
parallel, and why is the circle distorted, pee these are viewed 
through the transparent sheet ? 
11. Observe the very marked distortion of the two parallel lines, 
on Chart 37, induced by the radiating lines, when the transparent 
sheet is superimposed.

It is impossible to offer a satisfactory explanation of all these 
illusions. Different perebplogins will give not only different 
but oftentimes quite contradictory explanations of the same illu- 
sion. Very many different factors work, sometimes together, 
sometimes in opposition, to determine a given illusion. Some 
of these factors are the physiological processes of the retina, 
the relative difficulty and extent of the movements of the eyes, 
the association of the perception in question with perceptions 
from other objects in the field of vision, and the mode of orient- 
ing and exploiting the associated component parts of the object. 
These illusions are presented in this place in the Manual to 
give the student an opportunity of studying the diverse asso- 
ciations of partial perceptions, that result from different modes 
of distributing attention over the parts of the object. All the 
illusions are dependent in some way upon the direction of
-P-A-G-E-136
  100 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
attention to the figures. Figure a on Chart 35 is a good exam- 
ple of this. The figure is composed of two pairs of horizontal 
lines separated by a space, in the middle part of which are three 
dots in line with the two lower horizontal lines. The atten- 
tion that is directed to the dots is of secondary character and 
minor importance, compared with the major and primary atten- 
tion given to the lines. These lines are, therefore, the lines 
of orientation of the figure, and the dots are exploited and 
located with reference to them. The two lines being close 
together, they are not perceived separately, but the space 
which they occupy is seen as a single space. This space is 
actually above the space of the dots, for the dots are on a line 
with the lower horizontals. The space of the dots, associated 
thus with the space of the horizontals, is attracted toward it; 
in consequence, the dots appear to be above what would be the 
continuation of the lower horizontals. The movement of atten- 
tion is also easily observed in such figures as g on Chart 35. 
If the eyes are fixed steadily upon a point midway between the 
two parallels, and attention is thereby given to the parallels to 
the extent of ignoring the converging lines, the two verticals 
can be made to appear parallel. They appear to bend inward 
at the base, if we perceive them while distributing some atten- 
tion to the converging oblique lines. 
F. Complicated associational illusion. In reading this para- 
graph do you notice that the letters in the lines widely spaced and 
double leaded are apparently larger in size than the 
letters in the lines set in the usual way? Upon what 
do you think this apparent difference in size depends? Is it 
because, in a line set close, the eyes pass over the same number of 
letters in a shorter course? Or does the illusion arise from the 
belief that in two lines of equal length smaller letters must be used 
in the line containing the larger number? Or can the illusion be 
explained by a false reference of large letters to large spaces ?

Exprrriment XX. Complex perceptions, ideas, thoughts, feelings, 
and voluntary actions. 
A. Call to mind what you would think, feel, and do if you 
should see (1) a flash of lightning, (2) a case of diphtheria. 
B. What is courage? Beauty? Space? Attention? Apper- 
ception ? Mathematics? History? Geography ? 
C. What is your favorite picture? Why? What is the most 
beautiful building you have ever seen? Do you enjoy natural 
scenery ? Why? 
D. Do you believe in the gold or silver standard ? Why ? 
E. Do you believe the people of the United States were justified 
in their treatment of the Indian natives of this continent? If you 
had been compelled to fight in the South African war on either one 
side or the other, would you have chosen to fight with the British 
or the Boers? Why? : 
To be asked and to answer a question may constitute a psycho- 
logical experiment. The stimuli are the written or spoken 
words. The mind reacts to these stimuli with complex mental 
contents, memories, ideas, feelings, and groups of thoughts and 
feelings, which will constitute, in some cases, moral and other 
judgments. If you are asked, « What is courage?” the auditory 
perception of the words will be combined in your mind with 
memories of courageous action, numerous ideas associated with 
the manifestation of courage, and the feelings which you appro- 
priately associate with a judgment of the worth and significance 
of this moral quality. These ideas, feelings, and impulses to 
action will furnish a clue to the mental and moral character of 
your mind. They will also reveal the point of view from which 
you regard courage, whether as a virtue or a vice, etc. 
These questions and answers may be considered under five 
general heads: (a) complex perception; (6) conception, logical 
thought, and reason ; (c) aesthetic appreciation; (d) political 
and social judgments; (e) judgments of right and wrong.

102 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
A. Complex perception. All may see the same flash of 
lightning. One apperceives a dreaded instrument of destruc- 
tion and shows his orientation of this natural phenomenon by 
shutting the window and diving for the feather bed. Another 
apperceives an electrical display of great interest; from this 
point of view, he exploits or attentively observes his associated 
perceptions of the flash, its shape and color, the place where it 
comes to earth, the time that elapses between the flash and the 
clap of thunder. He will associate all of these perceptions with 
such ideas as he may be able to reproduce, respecting the phe- 
nomena and laws of electricity. Thus, as we are told, Franklin 
studied the lightning with his kite. 
Another illustration is furnished by the physician and the 
so-called Christian Scientist, who may both perceive the same 
disease, —let us say diphtheria. A knowledge of the facts of 
medical science and practice leads the physician to view the dis- 
ease as an infection caused by a specific germ whose ill effects 
may be opposed by an appropriate course of treatment. He 
therefore notes the time of the first appearance of the disease 
and the physical condition of his patient; he exploits all of his 
ideas on drugs and other remedies in order to form a judgment 
as to the proper treatment of the case. The Christian Scientist, 
on the other hand, views diphtheria as an idea. Believing all 
physical objects to be merely ideas in the mind and that any 
idea can be put out of mind by not thinking about it, he pro- 
ceeds to treat the disease in accordance with this point of 
view. 
B. Conception, logical thought, reasoning. When you are 
asked, ««What is mathematics?” the mind reacts with ideas and 
thoughts which represent and summarize your past experience 
with arithmetic, algebra, and related branches of knowledge.   
The definition or description of mathematics or of any one of 
the terms found in question B involves: (1) an idea suggested in 
the first instance by the term; (2) ideas, thoughts, and feelings
-P-A-G-E-139
ASSOCIATION 103 
associated with the initial idea; (3) the point of view which the 
individual takes toward the particular concept and toward its 
associated mental contents, and (4) a summary or synthesis of 
all the ideas most closely associated with the words. The orien- 
tation and exploitation of the ideas connected with a given term 
do not differ essentially from the orientation and exploitation 
of the parts of some external object. Psychology deals with 
abstract ideas and general terms as well as with perception. 
Logic is that branch of psychology which treats in detail of 
the analysis of ideas, and of their combination in associations 
or trains of thought called reasoning. 
C. Aesthetic appreciation. The perception of some objects 
is associated with an agreeable feeling and an impulse of attrac- 
tion ; the perception of others with a disagreeable feeling and 
an impulse of repulsion. The associated feeling varies with 
the character and constitution of the individual mind. In con- 
sequence, different persons will call one and the same object 
beautiful and ugly. The individual orientation, from which 
proceeds the aesthetic feeling, is often not readily discerned. 
In many cases, reflection alone. informs us of the reasons for 
our reacting, now with pleasure, now with displeasure, to the 
objects we call beautiful or ugly. Even upon mature reflection, 
so much doubt often remains, that, in popular opinion, there 
is no use arguing about matters of taste. This is equivalent 
to asserting that the point of view of the individual is final, or 
at least is the chief factor in determining aesthetic judgments. 
It cannot be maintained, however, that aesthetic taste is not 
susceptible of training. Change follows upon experience of, 
and familiarity with, those works of art and nature which the 
best minds agree in calling beautiful. With the increase in 
the number and quality of the ideas which can be associated in 
an individual mind with a given work of art or nature, comes 
a more developed point of view and a more expanded mental 
horizon, resulting in a higher level of aesthetic appreciation.

A broad education is as necessary to the enjoyment of a great 
poem, or painting, or musical composition, as it is to the com- 
prehension of the principles involved in the many questions 
upon which the citizen of the modern state may be called to 
express an opinion or cast a vote. 
D. Political and social judgments... Each student will prob- 
ably apperceive the question of a gold versus a silver standard 
from the point of view of either a Democrat or Republican or 
Populist. Our habits of mind and the mode of acquiring our 
stock of ideas make it almost impossible to view these questions 
from any other standpoint than that of the people among whom 
we have been brought up. Many in the East cannot conceive 
of an honest man’s favoring the ratio of sixteen to one, whereas 
many in the West believe that the adherents of the gold stand- 
ard are merely seeking to increase unjust gains from the loan- 
ing of money. A political argument on the gold and silver 
question will exploit all the facts from the point of view held 
by the disputant. If the argument is to succeed in converting 
a man from the one opinion to the other, it must either change 
his point of view or bring new facts into association with those 
already known. The point of view of the grown man is gen- 
erally too well established by his environment and mode of 
life to permit of much change. It therefore not infrequently 
happens that political arguments, in the form of popular 
addresses, attempting to exploit the facts from all points of 
view so as to hit the apperceptional tendencies of different 
minds, present many sophistical interpretations of the facts. 
E. Moral judgments. Judgments of right and wrong are 
determined by the most persistent elements of our nature. By 
the character or personality of an individual, we generally mean 
the character portrayed in his conduct and in the moral princi- 
ples to which he gives assent. In every expression of a moral 
judgment, involving the rightness or wrongness, the justice or 
injustice, of an action, the orientation or point of view of the
-P-A-G-E-141
  ASSOCIATION 105 
individual pronouncing the judgment is the deciding factor. | 
That the point of view of the same individual may differ even | 
with respect to the same actions can be demonstrated by the 
moral judgments given in answer to the questions of group E. 
Some persons will regard the action of a nation from the same 
point of view from which they regard the actions of individuals. 
On the other hand, there are those who judge the conduct of 
an individual much more rigidly than they do that of a nation or 
race. When we think of the sufferings of individual Indians, © 
we cannot help feeling that injustice was often inflicted in 
driving them from the land they originally occupied. There are 
even those to whom the peaceable purchase of land with worth- 
less beads seems a reprehensible act. To other minds, in view of 
the historical development of this continent, it appears a greater — 
wrong and injustice to have left undeveloped, in the hands of a 
few thousand uncivilized natives, the immense natural resources 
that have proved of such signal service to millions of people. 
The phrase “be an American,” in connection with questions of 
foreign policy, generally means orient and exploit the political 
issues from the point of view of national morality rather than from 
that of private morality. In judging the merits and demerits 
of the South African war between the British and the Boers, 
we in this country tend to judge the British from the generally 
higher standard of private morality because the national point 
of view is not involved. In the story of the Walrus and the 
Carpenter, Lewis Carroll has admirably portrayed a type of 
mind which can manifest at one time contrasting points of view. 
The situation, as presented in the poem, involves the question 
of the moral obligation of the Walrus to the Oysters, whom the 
Walrus and the Carpenter had invited one fine night to a 
promenade upon the beach. The Carpenter has but a single 
ethical standard ; to him the oysters are food only. But the 
Walrus finds that they appeal to his moral sensibilities as 
well, for
-P-A-G-E-142
  106 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
“It seems a shame,” the Walrus said, 
“To play them such a trick, 
After we’ve brought them out so far, 
And made them trot so quick!” 
The Carpenter said nothing but, 
“The butter’s spread too thick!” 
“I weep for you,” the Walrus said: 
“T deeply sympathize.” 
With sobs and tears he sorted out 
Those of the largest size, 
Holding his pocket-handkerchief 
Before his streaming eyes. 
With the conclusion of this chapter, we reach a turning 
point in our study of mental processes and contents. Hitherto 
we have considered mental contents, the component parts of 
which were readily ascertained. In the results of the experi- 
ments of this Manual, each and every one of us could directly 
observe what was brought into actual existence in his own 
mind. This method of study is called introspection or psychi- 
cal observation. But we have not only observed what was in 
our minds, we have dissected or analyzed the mental contents 
into their component parts. Introspective or psychical analysis 
informs us of the associations of simpler contents or elements, 
which constitute distinctive and discrete perceptions, memories, 
ideas, thoughts, feelings, etc. 
Psychical analysis, however, is able to give only a limited 
amount of information as to the constitution of mental con- 
tents. The conclusion of the first experiment of the Manual 
is an inference based upon more than what is given by the 
direct observation of the mental contents themselves. The 
figure of the staircase on Chart 1 gave rise to a perception of 
staircase from above and a different perception of staircase 
from underneath. Because one and the same physical stimulus 
acting upon the same sense organ produces two different
-P-A-G-E-143
  
ASSOCIATION 107 
perceptions, we infer that what is unlike in the two perceptions 
is to be attributed not to the stimulus nor to the sense organ 
but to the mind’s own activity. The knowledge that we have 
two perceptions is a psychical fact obtained from introspective 
observation; the knowledge that we have but one stimulus is 
a physical fact, obtained from objective or physical observation. 
The knowledge that the one stimulus gives rise to two percep- 
tions is a psycho-physical fact; to make use of this knowledge, 
as we did in ascribing a simple part of the perception to the 
stimulus and a more important part to apperception, is to 
employ the method of psycho-physical analysis. 
From another experiment, we learned that the retinal image 
of an object is inverted and that it varies in size with the 
distance of the object. The physiological processes excited 
in the retina, consequently, have only the merest suggestion 
of correspondence with the physical stimulus. Nevertheless 
the perception is fairly constant and closely approximates to 
our general knowledge of the object. Here again we inferred 
that the meagre result of sensation was transformed by the 
activity of apperception. This inference correctly follows from 
our knowledge of what takes place in the retina and of what is 
actually existing in the mind. This knowledge is a psycho- 
physiological fact. To ascertain the relative contributions of 
sensation and apperception, it is necessary for psychology to 
resort to psycho-physiological analysis. 
Association varies from the loosest kind of combination to 
the most intimate fusion and synthesis of elements. In the pre. 
ceding chapters, we have met with perceptions representing many 
different degrees of combination. We have, however, given 
chief consideration to those which are relatively less closely com- 
bined, and thus permit of direct and ready ascertainment. The 
more complicated a perception and the more intimate the com- 
bination of its component parts, the more difficult will it be 
to ascertain its constitution by introspective analysis alone.  
-P-A-G-E-144
  108 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Perceptions of space are among the most complicated that 
psychology is called upon to analyze and explain. A system- 
atic examination of what is actually received from the eyes 
and from other sensory sources will alone enable us to compre- 
hend the genesis of these highly complex perceptions. The 
next chapter enters upon a study of the perception of space. 
Although we shall rely as much as heretofore upon the results 
of introspection, the analysis will appear more evidently 
psycho-physiological. 
The sense organs and all physiological processes belong to the 
world of physical objects. In the broadest meaning of the word 
“physical,” the analysis of mental contents with reference to 
physiological processes may be considered to be psycho-physical. 
It is helpful, however, to make as obvious as possible the 
distinction between the physical facts, concerning the human 
body and its processes, and the physical facts of the extra- 
corporeal world and its stimuli. In analyzing some of our 
mental contents, more assistance is afforded by a knowledge 
of related physiological processes than by the knowledge of 
the physical stimuli. This is the case with visual perceptions. 
Contrariwise, other mental contents can be better analyzed 
and explained, if they are studied in relation to the physical 
stimuli which occasion them. This is the case with auditory 
perceptions. Some mental contents, therefore, are more readily 
approached for the purpose of systematic investigation by the 
way of psycho-physiological analysis and others by the way of 
psycho-physical analysis. An adequate explanation of the 
origin and constitution of any given perception, simple or com- 
plex, requires that the several results of introspective, psycho- 
physiological, and psycho-physical analysis be accorded their 
due measure of consideration.

PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 
ExrrerIMentT XXI. The eccentric location and projection of touches. 
Close the eyes and tap the floor with the tip of a cane, or move 
the point of a lead pencil over a book or table. Do the sensations 
of contact seem to come from the tip of the cane and point of the 
pencil ? 
Press vigorously upon one end of the cane or pencil, the other 
end being fixed immovably. Are the sensations of contact now more 
distinctly located in the hands and arms ? 
Touch the hair of the head. Do you feel the touch in the scalp 
or in the hair? Touch the table or any object with the finger-nail. 
Touch a pencil lightly to the teeth. Bite on the pencil. Touch 
single hairs on the back of the hand or fingers, on the inner and 
outer forearm. Where are the touch sensations located ? 
There are neither sense organs nor nerves in the hair and 
fingernails. A sensation of touch which is due to the excita- 
tion of nerves in the tissues at the base of the hair and nails 
is perceived as a touch or contact located at the outer ends of 
these structures. When a stick is held in the hand by one end, 
and its tip is gently moved over an external object, we feel as 
though we were actually touching the object at the other end 
and receiving a sensation directly from it. These sensations are 
not located in the hand, where the stick is grasped, because at 
the time we are having vivid perceptions of the external object 
at the far end of the stick. If the hair is touched, we know 
through experience that the object is not in contact with the 
scalp but with the ends of the hair. Attention is directed to all 
109  
-P-A-G-E-146
  110 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
our knowledge of the stimulus and not to the particular sen- 
sation alone. To locate the touch stimulus or touch sensation 
is to associate it with other sensations and with perceptions and 
ideas simultaneously present in consciousness. This associ- 
ation may cause the sensation to appear to be projected out- 
wardly, or eccentrically, from the body to the external object. 
ExprrermMent XXII. The “ local sign’’ of touches. 
Let the experimenter touch you with a pencil point on several 
places : on (a) the forehead; (6) the cheek ; (c) the backs of the two 
hands; (d) the finger tips. Describe as well as you can the partic- 
ular quality of the touch sensation in the different localities and 
tell what are the associated perceptions and ideas which enable you 
to recognize the place touched. For example, how do you tell your 
tight hand from your left? How do you know whether the fore- 
head or the cheek has been touched? Do you notice that you refer 
touch sensations to prominent members of the body, i.e., locate 
a touch on the cheek as near the eye, nose, mouth, or ear? 
When a spot on the skin is touched, the sensation that fol- 
lows has a distinctive character or quality. When two sufti- 
ciently separated spots are touched, two qualitatively different 
sensations result. Touch sensations are therefore said to differ 
in local quality or sign. 
This difference in quality is due in part to differences in 
the structure of the portions of the body touched. A touch 
on the skin over a bone will differ from a touch on the skin 
over a muscle or tendon. Furthermore, the sensation of touch 
is usually a combination of several distinguishable sensations ; 
even when it appears to be a simple, i.e, an unanalyzable, 
mental content, it represents the mental result of a fusion of 
several physiological processes. A touch sensation is never the 
result of the excitation of a single nerve fibre of touch. Even
-P-A-G-E-147
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE if 
if we suppose that a single nerve fibre could be excited indi- 
vidually to give rise to a simple sensation, it is to be assumed 
that the nerves of touch in different parts of the body would 
give somewhat different sensations. 
Under what conditions is it possible, when we receive quali- 
tatively different touch sensations, to localize the respective 
points of the skin that have been stimulated? A touch sensa- 
tion always brings with it into the mind a more or less vague 
perception or idea of the region of the body to which the 
point stimulated belongs. A touch on the back of the hand 
awakens not merely the sensation of a single touch, but also a 
perception or “feeling” of the whole hand; in other words, the 
touch sensation has a background, more or less vague, of the 
sensations and perceptions with which it has been associated 
in past experience. Thus a given touch sensation is generally 
located by referring it to some prominent member of the body ; 
for example, it may be described as being on the back of the 
forearm at a certain distance from the wrist or elbow. 
This perception of the spacial relations of a touch on the 
forearm is developed from the mental results of the movement 
of the opposite hand over the skin from the wrist to the stimu- 
lated point. The immediate result of a movement of one part 
of the body over other parts is an association of kinaesthetic 
sensations from the moving part with sensations of touch from 
points of the skin successively stimulated. The permanent 
result of repeated movements is a mental chart of a locality 
of the body, formed from the memories of these associated 
sensations of motion and contact. 
The associated kinaesthetic sensations may not be very prom- 
inent. It is often difficult to tell how one distinguishes the 
right hand from the left, and yet one may never be confused 
as to which is which. The right hand is used so much 
oftener than the left in manual activities that it is brought 
forward instinctively and readily whenever called upon, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
112 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
is distinguished from the left by a vague sensation or “feeling” 
of greater facility of movement. What has been said of the 
right applies of course to the left hand, in those who are born 
left-handed. Right-handedness is a natural characteristic of at 
least ninety persons in every hundred. Not more than five in 
every hundred are left-handed. Very few persons are really 
ambidextrous. Such persons often have great difficulty in tell- 
ing the right hand from the left; but one who is pronouncedly 
either right-handed or left-handed finds that the difference in 
kinaesthetic quality, resulting from the different use of the two 
hands in the past, assures immediate recognition. 
Kinaesthetic sensations also play an important part in assign- 
ing distance and location to objects external to the body. When 
an object is thought to be at some given distance, we generally 
mean that we should have to walk or otherwise move “so much” 
in order to reach it. It is still customary in some parts of the 
world to reckon distance in terms of the time it would take to 
traverse the distance. Many persons are even unable to give 
measurements in terms of inches or of feet, but will move the 
hands apart to indicate the distance, saying, “It is so long.” 
We tend to think of near-by objects as within reach or out of 
reach; we experimented during many months of infancy to fix 
this essential difference of spacial perceptions in mind. The 
location of more distant objects is also given primarily with 
reference to our bodies. Thus if one thinks of the four walls 
of the room and then of the door, he will think of these as 
though he were turning the head and eyes, or body, toward them. 
The spacial exploitation of the objects of the environment is 
ego-centric, that is, each object is referred to the place at which 
we happen to be or to some place in which we think ourselves. 
If we try to think of the location of some distant town, we 
may, it is true, refer its locality to the points of the compass, 
but north, east, south, and. west have no meaning until we have 
placed ourselves in some relation with these directions.

  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 113 
The retina of each eye is a sensitive surface in many respects 
analogous to the surface of the skin. The light rays, which 
directly stimulate it, may affect one point or be diffused over 
many points. The central point of the retina, the fovea cen- 
tralis, is distinctive; from it alone clear vision results, and the 
mechanism of the eye is so constructed that a stimulus acting 
upon the peripheral portion initiates reflexly the contraction 
of the muscles necessary to move the eye so as to cause the 
stimulus to act upon the fovea centralis. Through this move- 
ment of the eye, the stimulus acts successively upon all points 
of the retina situated between the fovea and the part first 
affected. The result is a continuous series of retinal sensations, 
each possessed of a distinctive local quality or sign, and each 
given its location in the retina with reference to the more 
prominent sensation of the fovea. The series of retinal sensa- 
tions has associated with it a continuous series of kinaesthetic 
sensations from the movement of the eyeball in its socket. 
The associated retinal and kinaesthetic sensations furnish the 
basis for an independent development of visual perceptions of 
space. These, however, are usually developed only in connec- 
tion with and in dependence upon the more general space 
perceptions constructed from associated sensations of touch and 
general bodily movements.

black card and prick a hole in it with a pin. With one eye 
closed, hold the card, as close as convenient before the other eye, in 
such a position that you can look through the hole at the sky or 
some distant bright object. Hold the pin with the head up between 
the screen and the eye and almost touching the eye. Move the pin 
to and fro, up and down, so that it appears to pass across the hole 
in the card. Observe the apparent position of the pin. Is it right

side up? Does it seem to be nearer than the card or farther away ? 
Does the image move across the opening of the card in a direction 
contrary to the actual movement of the pin ? 
The visual perception of the spacial attributes and relations 
of an object is dependent, in the first instance, upon sensa- 
tions that are the mental results of an image of the object 
formed on the retina of each eye. The refractive properties of 
the lens, by which the retinal image is inverted with reference 
to the external object, have already been considered (see 
page 18). The retinal image itself is never perceived. It is 
only the physical medium through which the object stimu- 
lates the rods and cones of the retina, and finally the optic 
nerve and brain, so as to give rise to a visual perception. 
The retinal image is in some respects similar to a shadow 
of the object. Both are surfaces and both vary in outline and 
size with the form and size of the object. From a shadow we 
can frequently infer the form, size, distance, and location of the 
object. But the interpretation of a shadow is fraught with 
many difficulties and possibilities of error, for the form and size 
of the shadow depend not only on the form and size of the 
object but also upon the distance and direction of the source of 
illumination. The retinal image varies not only with the actual 
form and size of the external object but also with its distance 
from the eye and the part of the retina on which the image hap- 
pens to fall. The visual image, i.e., the perception or mental 
image of an object, corresponds much more closely with the 
actual object than does the retinal image. The sensations 
which are due directly to the retinal image will vary in number 
and local quality, depending upon the size, form, distance, and 
location of the object. These sensations constitute an impor- 
tant part, but nevertheless only a part, of the visual image, for 
this is the perception of an object of definite spacial attributes 
and relations. The retinal sensations act as a mental cue for 
 
-P-A-G-E-151

PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 115 
the association of other sensations, perceptions, memories, and 
ideas, from the combination of which the complete visual image 
is constructed. 
Let the continuous outline of a pin, in the accompanying 
diagram, represent any object from which rays of light are 
reflected and brought to a focus on the retina of an eye. 
The head of the pin will cast its image at the end of the ray 
line, represented by the continuous line extending from the 
pin head to the retina. The retinal image of the pin point will 
lie above that of the pin head at the end of the ray line (the 
continuous line), extending from the pin point to the retina and 
crossing the ray line Object

yond the eye, at or 
near the locality of the object, and is not inverted with | 
reference to the object as is the retinal image. The visual 
image of the pin head appears to the mind as though it had 
been projected outward from the retina along a line which has 
practically the same position as the ray line of the retinal image. 
This line is called the projection line of the visual image; it is 
represented by the broken line extending parallel and close to 
the continuous line. As the broken line could not be repre- 
sented over the continuous straight line, it is drawn in the 
diagram a short distance to one side. The visual image of the 
pin point is likewise projected along a line which is practically 
coincident with the ray line of its retinal image (the broken line 
adjacent to the continuous line). Visual images are there- 
fore seen as though projected outward into space, point for 
point, through the lens along the ray lines that give rise 
to them, This statement expresses the fact that the inverted
-P-A-G-E-152
eT te 
116 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
relation of the retinal image to its object has no significance 
for the mind in comparison with the actual relations sub- 
sisting between objects, as these have been habitually per- 
ceived and located through the different senses. Projection 
is a visual habit of associating the retinal sensations with other 
mental contents, whereby the visual image acquires a greater 
semblance to the external reality than is possessed by the sensa- 
tions that can be directly referred to the stimulation of the 
retinal image. An experiment was recently made with a pair 
of glasses that caused the retinal image to be right side up with 
reference to the external object. For a time the subject wearing 
these glasses perceived objects as though they were inverted. 
He frequently blundered in attempting to reach for things 
within his field of vision. In a short time, however, perception 
and movement became accommodated to this change in the rela- 
tion of the retinal image to the external object, and the usual 
perception of their actual relations was reéstablished. 
The visual image of a shadow on the retina will be projected 
as though the shadow were a retinal image. Diagram IX rep- 
resents the conditions and results of the present experiment 
  Dracram IX. The projection of the visual image of a retinal shadow. 
with the shadow of a pin. The pin is held close before the 
eye; beyond the pin is a screen with a small opening. Rays 
of light falling upon the screen are represented by the hori- 
zontal straight lines. Some of these rays pass through the 
opening of the screen and, entering the eye-globe through the
-P-A-G-E-153
  
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 117 
pupil, illuminate the retina. The pin is an obstruction, as is 
the screen, in the pathway of these rays of light and casts a 
shadow of itself upon the retina. This retinal shadow will, 
of course, be right side up with reference to the real pin outside 
In consequence of the tendency under consideration to project 
a visual image point for point along the ray line of each point, 
the head of the shadow pin will be projected along the broken 
line represented in the diagram. This line has the position of 
what would have been the ray line of a pin head formed as 
a retinal image and not as a shadow. A point on the shaft 
of the pin will be projected along a line which crosses the pro- 
jection line of the pin head in the lens. The actual pin before 
the eye and behind the screen will consequently give rise to the 
perception of a dark, shadowy pin inverted. This shadow pin 
will generally be projected beyond the screen, and will then 
appear as though it were a pin viewed through the opening, 
larger than the real pin and at a distance of four or five inches 
from the eyes. 
So far as the lines of projection would indicate, the visual 
image might be projected to almost any distance. The farther 
the image is projected, the larger will the object appear to be. 
Visual size and distance are reciprocally related. If the one 
is established, either from previous knowledge of the object or 
from associated kinaesthetic sensations, the other will invari- 
ably be determined in consequence, no matter what the actual 
size of the retinal image-may be. In the illustration of Dia- 
gram VIII, the visual image is projected to its actual position 
in space rather than to some other distance, as, for example, 
that indicated by the broken outline of the pin. There will 
then be seen a bright shining pin of the standard size, which 
will be correctly located. Of the various factors that serve 
to determine this spacial perception, we have considered the 
retinal image and the projection of its mental correlate, the 
visual image. The conditions that determine the distance to 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  118 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
which the visual image shall be projected along the diverging 
projection lines and the resultant perception of size, will be 
considered in the experiments that are to follow. If these 
conditions do not positively determine the distance to which 
the visual image shall be projected, there is a tendency to pro- 
ject the image to an indefinite and variable distance, in many 
cases to the distance of most frequent accommodation, %.e., the 
reading distance. 
B. Entoptic shadows. 
1. Have you ever observed black or colored specks moving 
across the field of vision, as, for example, when looking at the 
sky ? If so, describe their appearance, movement, and apparent 
position with reference to the eye. 
2. Sit in a dark room, about five feet in front of a white wall; 
close the left eye and look with the right eye toward the wall 
without moving the eye. Hold a lighted candle in the right hand 
two or three inches in front of the right eye and off to one side of 
the line of sight, so that the candle throws its light through the 
pupil upon the retina, without being itself clearly visible. Move 
the candle about slowly. Do you see the projected image of the 
retina with its blood vessels, yellow spot, and blind spot in outline ? 
Draw and describe what you see. 
The dark specks are the so-called muscae volitantes, literally 
“flying mice.” They are due to particles in the vitreous humor 
which cast shadows upon the retina. Looking at the ceiling, 
these spots will be large and appear at some distance. If the 
eyes are directed to some surface close at hand, e.g., a sheet of 
paper, they will appear small, and to float over the surface of the 
paper. A projected image of the retina will contain the shadow 
outline of the blood vessels of the innermost layer; the image 
will have the appearance of the retina as represented in Dia- 
gram VI, page 48. All structures of the retina, intercepting the 
rays of light before they reach the rods and cones, cast shadows
-P-A-G-E-155
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 119 
upon the sensitive layer of the retina. When the shadows 
become objects of perception, the shadow images are projected 
outward to a distance which is determined by the distance of 
that object in the field of vision which is receiving atten- 
tion at the moment, namely, the plane of the ceiling or of the 
paper. This plane of attention, to which all visual images 
are referred, unless certain definite conditions cause them to 
be projected to a greater or less distance, is called the plane 
of projection. o 
Experiment XXIV. Monocular accommodation. 
A. The kinaesthetic sensation of monocular accommodation. 
Stand a few feet in front of a window. Close one eye and hold a 
finger at a distance of about six inches before the other, and at right 
angles to one of the horizontal bars of the window. Look at 
the window bar and observe the appearance of the finger. Look 
at the finger and observe whether the window bar becomes dim 
and diffused. Hold the finger at arm’s length before the open eye; 
move it slowly toward the eye until it is against the lashes; move 
it slowly away until it is again at arm’s length, fixating continuously 
with the open eye. Does the sensation of effort and eye strain 
increase as the finger is moved toward the eye, and decrease as it is 
moved away from the eye? 
B. Diffusion due to imperfect accommodation, and the relation 
of apparent distance and size to the definition and diffusion of the 
retinal image. Close one eye and accommodate the other eye for 
a fine needle or pin held vertically before it and about eighteen 
inches distant. Move the needle slowly toward the eye, continuing 
to accommodate for it. When the needle is brought within about 
six inches of the eye, does it become dimmer, more diffuse, and 
apparently larger ? 
Prick a hole in a card with the needle. Hold the card close to 
the eye and look through the hole at the needle as before. Can 
you now bring the needle nearer to the eye without its becoming 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
120 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
indistinct and diffuse? What effect has the small aperture of the 
card upon the apparent size of (1) the needle near at hand, and 
(2) a distant object, when the eye is accommodated for the nearer 
and when it is accommodated for the farther object ? 
Let N in Diagram X be any point of an object near the 
eyes. . This point will reflect rays of light in all directions, 
a large bundle of which (the five 
diverging lines) will pass through the 
pupil to the lens, by which they will 
be bent or refracted, and brought to 
a focus. If the heavy outline of the 
  Dracram X. Diffusion circle 
from an imperfect accom- lens represents a medium curvature, 
modation of the lens for a 
near point. the rays of light will be brought to 
a point at some distance behind the 
retina. Where these rays are intercepted by the retina they will 
be spread over a circular area, represented in the diagram by 
the amount of space covered by the five lines. These circular 
areas, due to imperfect accommodation of the lens for the dis- 
tance of the object, are called diffusion circles. As every point 
of the object gives rise to a diffusion circle, the total retinal 
image will be indistinct, diffuse, and large. The external object 
may, under such conditions, appear at a greater distance and 
larger than it really is. : 
If the rays from the point WV are to be brought to a focus on 
the retina, the curvature of the lens must become greater, i.e., 
assume the form indicated by the dotted line. When this is 
accomplished through the vigorous contraction of the ciliary 
muscle, every point of the external object will cast a corre- 
sponding point upon the retina. The retinal image being thus 
clearly defined, the visual image will appear correspondingly 
distinct. The apparent distance of the object, i.e., the distance 
to which the visual image is projected, depends in part upon the 
size and definition of the retinal image, but in part also upon
-P-A-G-E-157
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 121 
the particular quality and intensity of the kinaesthetic sensa- 
tion received from that amount of contraction of the ciliary 
muscle which is necessary to produce the focusing of the image 
upon the retina. 
In Diagram XI, let D represent a distant point. The rays 
from this point will be brought to a focus, when the lens is in a 
condition of medium curva- 
ture, somewhere between the 
lens and the retina. Beyond 
this point the rays will di- 
verge, giving rise to a diffu- 
sion circle upon the retina. DIAGRAM XI. Diffusion circle from ain 
Te the point Bao sbentanuaed eevee See of the lens for 
, point. 
upon the retina, the ciliary 
muscle must relax its tension and the lens be brought to a 
condition of less curvature through the outward pull exerted 
  by the suspensory ligament and ciliary processes (see the 
description of the mechanism of accommodation, pages 82-35). 
The screen with a small hole through which an object is 
  
    viewed cuts off the outer rays and diminishes the area of the   
diffusion circles. Not only the distinctness of the object, but 
also its apparent size and distance, will be modified by the 
relative diffusion of its retinal image. 
C. The near and far limit of accommodation. 
1. Prick in a card two small holes so close together that both are 
within the diameter of the pupil. Close one eye and hold the card 
before the other eye, with the holes in a horizontal line. Look 
through the holes at a needle held vertically at a distance of fifteen 
inches. Fixating the needle steadily, move it toward the eye until 
two images of the needle are seen, one in each hole. This is the 
near limit of accommodation. 
2. Stick the needle upright in a piece of cardboard and move 
away from it, until two images are seen, one in each hole. This is 
the far limit of accommodation.
-P-A-G-E-158
    122 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
3. Hold the needle at a distance of ten inches and fixate it 
through the two holes, so that a single image is obtained. Look 
at some distant object. Does the needle appear double? Are the 
double images dimmer than the single image? Stop the hole to 
the right; which image disappears? TFixate some object nearer 
than the needle. Are the images double? Stop the hole to the 
tight; which image now disappears ? 
4. Determine the near and far limits of accommodation, when 
the needle is horizontal and the two holes are in a vertical line. 
Compare these limits with those obtained above. 
5. Prick in a card four or five holes close together, so that all 
are within the diameter of the pupil. Hold the card and-the needle 
as directed above. Fixate the needle; is the image single? Fixate 
a distinct object; do you see as many images as there are holes in 
the card? 
If the production of diffusion circles has been understood, 
there will be little difficulty in comprehending the results of 
this experiment. Let F, Dia- 
gram XII, represent a point 
from which rays of light pro- 
ceed to the lens to be first 
refracted and then focused at 
some point behind the retina. 
If some of these rays are cut 
off by the screen and only a 
few are permitted to pass through say two openings in the screen, 
these rays will continue through the lens as two distinct bundles, 
to fall upon the retina as two separate diffusion circles, or images, 
of the external point. When the lens (the dotted outline) is 
accommodated for the point, these two bundles of rays will be 
more refracted and will unite at a point upon the retina, as 
shown by the two groups of dotted lines. With the screen in 
position, the eye may be alternately accommodated for the 
needle or for an object at a greater or less distance. In the first   
  Diagram XII. Double images of diffusion 
due to imperfect accommodation.
-P-A-G-E-159
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 123 
case, a single clear image of the needle will be seen, and in the 
second case, two diffused and larger needles will appear through 
the screen. If the number of holes in the screen is four or 
five, and yet all the holes are so arranged that they are within 
the diameter of the pupil, they will permit an equal number’ of 
separate bundles of rays to pass to the lens. The bundles of 
rays will give rise to separate diffusion images if the object is 
viewed without accommodation, but to a single image if the 
survature of the lens is adapted to the distance of the object. 
The lens is not the only structure of the eye which refracts 
the light rays during their passage from the outer surface of 
the cornea to the retina. The cornea, the aqueous humor of the 
anterior chamber, and the vitreous humor, all contribute to the 
refraction to which the rays are subjected. The amount of 
refraction is dependent upon the substance of these various 
structures and upon the curvature of their boundary surfaces. 
The refraction of these structures is constant; that of the lens 
is variable, depending upon the accommodation of the curvature 
of its anterior surface (to a small extent of its posterior surface 
also) to the distance of the object. When the ciliary muscle is 
relaxed, the refraction of the lens added to that of these other 
structures is just sufficient, in an eye that is considered nor- 
mal, to focus parallel rays, ¢.e., rays from an infinite distance. 
Such an eye with its ciliary muscle in a state of maximum con- 
traction is also able to focus rays from a point at an average 
minimum distance of 10-12 cm. (4 inches). These limits of 
accommodation are much greater than the practical limits of 
muscular adjustment; the ciliary muscle is, indeed, completely 
relaxed in accommodating for objects not more than 65 metres 
(200 feet) from the eye. The function of the kinaesthetic sensa- 
tion from the ciliary muscle, in determining the distance to 
which a visual image shall be projected and in forming the con- 
sequent judgment of the distance of the object, is restricted to a 
much narrower range of distances than would appear from the
-P-A-G-E-160
  124 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
mere statement of the normal eye’s limits of accommodation. 
The near-sighted or myopic eye has its most distant point of 
accommodation much nearer than that assigned above as the far 
limit of the normal eye; it is only with the near-sighted eye 
that a far limit of accommodation can be obtained by the method 
of this experiment. 
The structure of the lens, cornea, and other refracting media 
may be such that the amount of refraction is not equal in all 
meridians. The amount of refraction, for example, may be 
greater in the vertical than in the horizontal meridian. This 
will make it impossible for an eye to be exactly accommo- 
dated at one time for vertical and horizontal lines at the same 
distance. This defect of the eye is called astigmatism. 
EXPERIMENT XXYV. Single perceptions from double sense organs. 
Click two coins near the head of a subject, seated and having his 
eyes closed. Try at different positions in the prolonged median 
plane of the head and compare results with those obtained in 
positions to the right and left of such plane. Compare the sub- 
ject’s accuracy in the location of sounds coming from behind and 
from in front of the ears. Be careful that the subject is not 
assisted by the hearing of sounds made by the moving arms. What 
seem to be the conditions for the correct and false localization of 
sound stimuli ? 
A difference in the relative intensity of the sensations obtained 
from the right and left ears seems to determine the localization 
of a sound to the right or left respectively. Errors are frequent 
when the sound stimulus is in the median plane, because its 
intensity is then the same at both ears, and the two sensations 
are consequently of equal intensity also. When we locate a 
sound as coming from the right, we do not perceive two 
sound sensations but only one, and yet we have two ears, each  
-P-A-G-E-161
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 125 
receiving its own stimulus. It is impossible to decide whether 
we should regard this single perception as a fusion of two sensa- 
tions or of two physiological processes before they give rise to 
the single perception. 
A similar fusion of two sensations, or of two physiological 
processes as the case may be, in a single perception can be 
demonstrated also in the field of touch. If the middle finger 
is crossed over the index finger so as to bring the tip of the 
middle finger on the thumb side of the index finger, a bullet, 
marble, or pencil may be inserted between the ends of the two 
fingers thus crossed. The subject will then feel as though he 
were being touched by two objects. If the same object touch 
two adjacent fingers in their normal position, he will, even with 
the eyes closed, feel but one object touching him. The two 
different surfaces stimulated should give rise in both cases to 
two sensations. But the two sensations from surfaces habitu- 
ally stimulated by one and the same object are fused in a 
single perception of the object. It requires some unusual 
position of the two fingers to give rise to what is the more 
primitive double perception. 
This fusion is a selection, by attention, of one element of the 
complete perception. The selection is readily observed if one 
touches with the tip of his own finger various portions of the 
body. The resulting sensations will seem to come either from 
the tip of the finger or from the part of the body touched, 
depending upon which is given attention at the moment. 
Those sensations which fail to gain much attention may 
drop out of consciousness. They are said to be suppressed or 
inhibited. 
The sense organ of vision is a double one. Each eye has its 
own retinal image of the object of perception. Under certain 
conditions, a visual image or perception of the object is obtained 
from the retinal image of each eye; under other conditions, the 
two retinal images give rise to a single perception of the object.
-P-A-G-E-162

Experiment XXVI. Double visual images. 
A. Displacement of one eye from the position of binocular codr- 
dination. Look at any object. Do you observe one or two images 
of the object? With the finger, gently press the eyeball out of its 
ordinary position. Do you then see one or two images of the 
object? If two, which is the more distinct —that belonging to the 
eye subjected to pressure or that of the other eye? If you always 
receive an image of the object from each eye, why do you get double 
images only when you displace one of the two eyes from the position 
of binocular codrdination ?

tion of the object. The ray lines of the point F (the solid lines in 
the diagram) pass directly to the centers of the two retinae. A 
single image of F is seen, under these conditions, at the locality 
of F. In producing a single visual perception, the two visual 
images act as though they had been projected outward to 
coincide at the locality of # The projection lines (broken 
lines in the diagram) which represent this fact have practically

PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 127 
the same position as the ray lines (see page 115). When the 
two eyes are in the position of binocular codrdination, both 
being directed upon a given point, the projection line of each 
eye’s visual image of the point coincides with the ray line of its 
retinal image and also with the line of sight of the respective 
eye. Under ordinary conditions of binocular codrdination, 
the two visual images are projected to the common point of 
intersection of the ray lines, projection lines, and lines of sight 
of the two eyes; as a consequence, the two images coincide at 
this point and combine in a single perception. 
If one eye-globe, say the left, is displaced so that its line of 
sight is directed off to the left of the point (indicated in the 
diagram by the dotted outline of the cornea), the image of 7 
must fall upon the retina somewhere to the left of its center 
(at f), at a distance determined by the amount of displacement 
to which the eye has been subjected. Two visual images of the 
point will then appear, the image belonging to the left eye 
being to the right of that belonging to the right eye. The 
distance between these two perceptions of the point will be pro- 
portional to the distance of the retinal image of the left eye 
from the fovea. The ray line of this retinal image is the con- 
tinuous line Ff. If its visual image were projected in accord- 
ance with the habit of monocular vision, the projection line 
would coincide with the ray line, and the visual image of the 
left eye would coincide with that of the right eye at the locality 
of F. The result of this experiment shows that the visual image 
of the left eye appears at 7” to the right of /; the visual image 
must have been projected in a manner not determined by the 
habit of monocular vision. If the left eye were binocularly 
coérdinated with the right, a retinal image at f would give 
the perception of a point located along the line fF’ (at 7’); 
for in this position of the left eye, it is a point at #’ which is 
usually the cause of a stimulation of the retina at f. In the 
present case, the retina of the left eye is stimulated at f, because 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  128 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
the whole eye is displaced, but the image is projected as though 
the retina had been stimulated with the left eye in the position 
of binocular codrdination. The left eye is stimulated inde- 
pendently, but the mental result of such stimulation is deter- 
mined by the habit of the two eyes as a single, although binocular, 
mechanism. <A habit of monocular vision gives way before a 
habit of binocular vision, when unusual conditions compel a 
choice between the two. 
B. The convergence of the two eyes upon a distant object will 
cause all objects nearer to the eyes to give double images. 
1. Hold up the forefinger of the right hand about ten inches 
in front of the eyes and look beyond the finger at the wall. Do 
you observe two transparent or shadowy images of the finger? If 
you do not get the double images readily, close each eye alternately 
and observe the respective places on the wall against which the 
finger is projected. Then open both eyes and observe the two 
shadowy images at both places. 
2. Point with the forefinger of the right hand at some distant 
object, holding the hand just a little in front of the nose. Look 
with both eyes at the object beyond the finger. Do you see two 
images of the pointing finger? Which of the two images is pointing 
at the object? To which of the two eyes does this finger belong ? 
Many persons have great difficulty in perceiving the two 
images. One or the other of the two is overlooked or sup- 
pressed. In some persons, it is usually the image of the right 
eye ; in others, that of the left. If one of the two retinal images 
falls on a more sensitive locality of the retina than the other, 
its visual image will gain attention and the other is likely to be 
suppressed. A few persons will be quite unable, even after 
many trials, to get double images, and yet the two images are 
always on the retina, and two perceptions are usually present 
in consciousness, even though one may be so indistinct as to 
appear below the threshold of perception. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 129 
C. Convergence upon any one object causes double images of 
objects nearer and farther than the object fixated. Hold up the 
two forefingers directly before the eyes, one in front of the other 
at a distance apart of ten or twelve inches. Fix the gaze on the

double? If so, close the right eye and see whether the right or 
left image of the nearer finger disappears. If the right-hand image 
disappears, it belongs to the 
tight eye. Close the left eye 
to determine which of the two 
images belongs to it. 
Fix the gaze on the nearer 
finger. Do you get double 
images of the farther finger ?

to the right eye, and the left-hand image to the left eye. A 
point more distant than the point of fixation therefore gives        
tise to homonomously (of like name) double images.

PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 131 
It must not be supposed that the plane of fixation, to which 
the double images are said to be projected and which in con- 
sequence is called the plane of projection, has a real objective 
existence. It is the plane or region of binocular attention, to 
which all visual images are referred in making judgments of 
relative distance or depth. If no other conditions than those 
of binocular projection determined the apparent distance of an 
object, the double images would always be seen in or near the 
plane of fixation. But kinaesthetic sensations from the ciliary 
muscle, the diffusion of the retinal images of objects nearer and 
farther than the point of fixation, and many other factors that 
are still to be considered, will cause the double images to be 
projected a greater or less distance than the object fixated. It 
will be discovered by the student that the doubled objects are 
rarely seen at the same distance as the single object upon which 
the eyes are converged, but usually nearer or farther away. 
They are, however, just as rarely seen at the actual distance of 
the object, appearing rather to be displaced toward the plane 
of fixation. This fact serves to prove that the reference of 
visual images to a plane of binocular fixation and attention is 
at least one ot the several factors that conjointly determine 
the perception of distance. 
Experiment XXVII. The single perceptions of binocular vision. 
A. The fusion of images from two similar objects. Hold up 
the forefinger of each hand before the eyes, the two fingers being 
separated by a distance ot tour or five inches, Look between the 
fingers at the sky or wall beyond. Do you see four images, two of 
each finger ? 
Move the fingers toward one another until the two middle 
images combine. Does the middle image look more real than the 
shadowy images to the right and left ? 
By closing first one eye and then the other, determine to which 
   
-P-A-G-E-168
  132 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
of the two eyes, respectively, belongs each of the two images that 
combine; each of the two that do not combine. 
B. The interocular distance. Hold before the eyes a pair of 
dividers with the arms spread apart; look between the separated 
points at the sky, keeping them in such position that the points are 
on a level with and about four or five inches in front of the eyes. 
Gradually close the arms of the dividers, until two of the four 
images of the points unite. Measure this distance. 
The distance measured in this way will usually be somewhat 
less than the interocular distance, t.e., the distance between the 
centers of the two eyes. When the eyes are fixed upon the 
sky, the lines of sight are parallel, although there is often a 
slight convergence as for a nearer point. In dreamy reverie, 
the eyes are held as though gazing at something at an infinite 
distance and the lines of sight are nearly paraliel. In all experi- 
ments requiring the parallel position of the two eyes, it is help- 
ful to think of looking off into a very remote distance and to 
assume the mental attitude of reverie. When the eyes are held 
so that the lines of sight are parallel, the same distance sepa- 
rates the centers of the two pupils and the centers of the two 
retinae. A convenient method of measuring the interocular 
distance is to hold the eyes parallel and let some one measure 
with a rule the distance between the two pupils. The inter- 
ocular distance must be found by actual measurement for each 
pair of eyes. 
C. Corresponding points. Make in a card with the point of a 
pencil two holes at the interocular distance apart. Hold the card 
against the forehead with a hole exactly in front of each eye. 
Look through the two holes at some distant object. Do you appear 
to be looking through two holes or through only a single one? If 
the two holes do not appear as one, increase or diminish the dis- 
tance between them on the card. A few trials may be necessary 
to find the proper distance to bring about perfect coincidence.
-P-A-G-E-169
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 133 
Corresponding points are the two points, one in each retina, 
which habitually give rise either to a single visual image, as in 
the present experiment, or to superimposed but uncombined 
visual images, as in the cases to be illustrated under the next 
experiment. The visual images from corresponding points 
appear, therefore, to be projected to the same point in space, 
where they coincide and are seen as a single visual image, if 
the respective retinal images are alike, but are superimposed 
and seen as two uncombined visual images, if the retinal images 
on the corresponding points are unlike. To illustrate the rela- 
tion of corresponding points to the fusion of the two similar 
images, let R and Z in the accompanying diagram represent 
the retinae of the right and left eyes respectively. The cen-

ters of the two retinae are indicated by ¢ and ec’. These are 
geometrically similar and anatomically identical points. They 
are also corresponding points, because the retinal images cast 
upon them by an external object usually give rise to a single 
visual image. 
The lines a¢é and a'c'b! divide the two retinae into bilat- 
erally symmetrical halves. The right half of the retina of the 
right eye corresponds point for point with the right half of the 
left eye, and similarly the left half of the right eye corre- 
sponds with the left half of the left eye. Let e and e! be two
-P-A-G-E-170
134 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
points geometrically similar and anatomically identical with 
reference to their distance and direction from the retinal centers 
e and ec’. These are also likely to be corresponding points, 
that is, they will give rise to single vision. On the other hand, 
the two points d and d’ are neither anatomically identical nor 
can they be physiologically corresponding points. 
Identical points are usually, but not always, corresponding 
points. The two retinae seem to correspond for purposes of 
single vision, not point for point, but area for area. Thus a 
given small area of one retina represented by the concentric 
circles, f, is physiologically corresponding with an identical 
area in the other retina, f’, also represented by concentric cir- 
cles. When the central points of these areas are stimulated, 
single vision always results ; 
when the center of one area 
and any other point of the 
identical area are stimulated, 
single or double vision may 
result; when the center of one 
area and a point outside the 
identical area are stimulated, Left Field of Vision Right Field of Vision

ternal field of vision is divided 
at the point of fixation, F, into a left field of vision and a right 
field. The portion of the left field of vision affecting the right 
eye is represented by horizontal lines; an object in this part of 
the field of vision acts upon the right half of the retina. This
-P-A-G-E-171
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 185 
portion of the left field of vision, 7.e., the left binocular field, and 
the rest of the left field, z.e., the left monocular field, fall also 
upon the right half of the retina of the left eye. The binocular 
portion of the left field is common to the homonomous halves 
of the two retinae. It is from this part of the left external field 
that single binocular vision is possible. Each optic nerve as it 
emerges from the eye is composed of two groups of fibres. The 
group of fibres connected with the right half of each retina is 
represented in the diagram by a heavy black line. These fibres 
constitute about one-half of each optic nerve until they reach 
the optic chiasm. Here those from the left eye cross and join 
the corresponding fibres from the right eye; together they then 
constitute the right optic tract which is in physiological con- 
nection with the right half of the brain. The fibres from the 
left half of the retina of the right eye also cross in the chiasm 
and join those from the left half of the left eye to compose 
the left optic tract, which is similarly related to the left half 
of the brain. An injury causing destruction of the right optic 
tract will produce total blindness for objects contained within 
the left half of the field of vision, without affecting in any 
manner the vision for objects lying within the right half of the 
external field. 
With the eyes fixed upon a point in space, how many other 
points can be seen single without changing the position of the 
two eyes? The geometrical figure that will be constructed by 
a combination of all the points seen singly at one moment of 
fixation is called the horopter. On the supposition that the 
retina is the inner surface of a perfect sphere, and that all the 
points casting images upon identical points will be seen single, 
the horopter will be the inner surface of a large sphere pass- 
ing through the point of fixation and the centers of the two 
eyes. By definition, every point that is not in the surface of 
this sphere will give rise to double images. The horopter, 
as a matter of fact, is a much more complex figure, because : 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  136 ANALYTICAL eae 
(1) the eye-globes are not perfect spheres; (2) anatomically 
identical points do not always give single vision; (8) those 
points which do give single vision, called corresponding points, 
seem to have a different relative location in the retinae for 
different positions of the two eyes. 
D. The line of binocular sight. 
1. Observe that when the two holes in the card are binocularly 
combined, the single hole is seen at a middle point between the 
two eyes. 
2. Rule on a sheet of paper two parallel lines, five or six inches 
long, at the interocular distance apart. Cut a notch in the end of 
the sheet, midway between the two parallel lines, so that it will 
fit against the root of the nose. Hold the sheet in such position 
against the nose that you are able to look along its upper sur- 
face with the lines ruled upon it. Look at some distant object to 
get the two eyes in the parallel position. Each eye will then be 
directed along a line that extends straight out.from it. Do the two 
lines now combine into a single line apparently extending outward 
from the root of the nose ? | 
3. Hold a card vertically against the nose and forehead. When 
you look at a distant object, do you seem to be looking between two 
shadowy cards at the interocular distance apart ? 
4. Ina sheet of paper, of foolscap size, make a small hole with 
the point of a pencil. Hold the paper close to the eyes, with the hole 
to the right of the right eye and on a level with it. Hold the two 
eyes parallel, as though looking beyond the paper at the wall or 
sky. Move the sheet toward the left so that the hole passes directly 
first in front of the right eye and then in front of the left eye. 
The hole will appear at the right of the median line, move across 
the median line and disappear to the left, to be followed a moment 
later by a second hole running the same course. 
5. Look at the reflection of your eyes in a mirror. With the 
eyes in the parallel position, gradually approach the mirror until 
the nose and the forehead touch its surface. Do the eyes seem 
to combine into one large eye? . :

tion; the two holes in the sheet of paper or the two similar 
lines or objects are represented by 4A and B, which cast their 
images upon a and 8, the centers of the right and left retinae 
respectively. When a single binocular perception results from 
the fusion of the two images, the apparent object is located 
somewhere along a median line drawn straight out between the 
two eyes from the root of the nose. The projection line of the

ocular distance to the left, and the projection line of the left 
eye half the interocular distance to the right. The super- 
imposed and combined images, B’ 4’, will be seen as though 
they had been projected to some point along a common line 
of binocular projection. The lines of sight of the two eyes 
then appear to coincide in a single line of binocular sight 
extending, as represented in the diagram by the two broken 
lines, straight out from the root of the nose. The two eyes 
in binocular projection act together to give the same result that 
would be accomplished by a single eye situated at a mid-point 
between the two eyes. The two superimposed broken outlines 
of the right and left eyes suggest the relation of this imaginary 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  138 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
binocular eye to the line of binocular sight. The binocular 
eye is sometimes referred to as the “Cyclopean” eye. 
An illusory appearance of such an eye is obtained in a 
striking fashion when a mirror is so adjusted to the two eyes 
that the reflection of the right eye is seen by that eye alone, 
and the reflection of the left eye by the left eye alone. 
Experiment XXVIII. Binocular ‘strife’? from the superposition 
of dissimilar images. 
A. Hold up before the right eye the forefinger of the right 
hand, and before the left eye the palm of the left hand; look at 
the sky or wall between them. Do you observe the finger appar- 
ently lying in the palm of the hand ? 
Superimpose in the same way a finger and a pencil; pencils of 
different color; a pencil and a penholder. 
Notice the curious alternation of the two images, first one and 
then the other being suppressed; sometimes both may seem to 
coexist for a moment in the same place. 
B. Fix the gaze upon the squares of Chart 33, opposite page 
92, holding the eyes parallel so as to look at the middle of the 
small white. square with the right eye, and at the middle of the 
small black square with the left eye. 
When the large and small black and white squares are super- 
imposed, you will perceive now only the white design, now only 
the black; again the two will blend, not however to form a 
homogeneous gray, but in such a manner that black will be 
seen at some points and white at other points. This will give 
the effect of the “sheen” of a polished black surface, because 
such surfaces reflect, in addition to their own color, rays of 
white and colored light from surrounding objects. 
It may be of assistance in this experiment and others of like 
nature to hold the chart against the forehead so that the figure 
to the right is opposite the right eye, and that to the left
-P-A-G-E-175
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 139 
opposite the left eye. With the chart in this position, get the 
eyes parallel by thinking of looking straight out through the 
chart into the distance. Move the chart slowly away from 
the head, keeping the distant view in mind so as not to disturb 
the parallelism of the eyes, but attending to the two designs 
while doing so. Repetition of this procedure is a great help 
in gaining control over the codrdination of the eyes. 
The shadowy images to the right and left of the superim- 
posed images are often confusing and distracting. They may 
be prevented by the use of a screen. For combination with the 
eyes in the parallel position, a card three inches wide extending 
in the median line from the root of the nose to the designs or 
objects to be combined will entirely shut out the shadowy 
images. This is a median screen and obstructs the crossed ray 
lines from the objects to the retinae. 
C. Superimpose the black and white squares by crossed fixation. 
Hold the head and the chart fixed, the chart being about fifteen 
inches before the face. The right eye must now be made to 
look directly at the small square to the left, and the left eye 
directly at the square to the right. To accomplish this, hold a 
pencil with the point uppermost between the eyes and the chart. 
Bring the pencil point into such position that, with the right eye 
closed, the left eyé sees the pencil point in the middle of the square 
to the right; and with the left eye closed, but without moving the 
pencil or head or chart, the right eye sees the point in the middle 
of the square to the left. 
To facilitate combination with the lines of sight crossed, 
two lateral screens are necessary, one directly in front of each 
eye, so that the direct rays are shut off and the crossed rays 
only are allowed to pass to the retinae. A very convenient 
form of lateral screen can be prepared by cutting out of the 
middle of a sheet of paper a circular opening about one inch 
in diameter. Hold this screen in a position between the eyes
-P-A-G-E-176
    140 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
and the objects to be combined, and move the screen toward 
and away from the eyes until the place is found at which, with- 
out moving the head or screen, the left eye can see through 
the circular opening only the object to the right, and the right 
eye can see only the object to the left. Then open both eyes 
and fix the gaze on the lower edge of the circular opening. 
Place a small plain cross on the screen at the edge of the open- 
ing to assist the eyes in converging steadily upon the plane of 
the screen. 
Those who cannot combine these images binocularly, even 
with the aid of the screens, may find it necessary to prepare 
designs similar to the squares on Chart 83. Cut at the 
center of each design a hole one-eighth of an inch in diameter, 
and paste the two designs on a piece of window glass with 
their centers at the interocular distance apart. Hold the glass 
against the eyes, looking through the central openings at the 
sky; move the glass away until it is about a foot distant, 
keeping the eyes in the same fixed parallel position. The eyes 
will then easily retain the requisite parallel codrdination. 
D. Take a sheet of note paper and roll it into a tube about 
three-quarters of an inch in diameter. With the left eye, look 
through the tube at the objects beyond. Hold the back of the 
right hand four inches distant from, and directly in front of, the 
right eye. Look at the hand and through the tube at the same 
time. Do you seem to be looking through a hole in the hand? Do 
you see the skin of the hand across the apparent hole? Make a 
mark with red or black ink upon the part of the hand which disap- 
pears in the hole. Are you able to see the mark in the hole? Do 
you now notice a hazy outline of the skin of the hand extending 
across the hole ? 
E. Superimpose the images of the apple and the plate (Chart 
38, opposite page 144), holding the eyes so that the lines of sight 
are either (a) parallel or (4) crossed. When the image of the apple 
is imposed upon the image of the defective middle portion of
-P-A-G-E-177
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 141 
the plate, do the two images appear to combine into the single 
perception of an apple on a plate? 
In cases of binocular strife, the image that has distinctive 
features likely to gain attention will be perceived while the 
less attractive image may be totally suppressed. 
ExrERIMENT XXIX. The perception of reality and solidity from 
the binocular fusion of similar images. 
A. Place two small coins at about the interocular distance 
apart, projecting over the edge of the table, with the same side up 
and in similar positions. Look at the right-hand coin with the- 
right eye and at the left-hand coin with the left eye. In order to 
do this, imagine yourself looking beyond the coins at the floor, or 
at some object at a still greater distance. Do you see an apparently 
solid and real coin halfway between two shadowy coins? 
Hold a card extending from the root of the nose and forehead 
to the table midway between the two coins. Do the shadowy 
images disappear, leaving the single coin in the middle looking still 
more real than before ? 
B. Combine the crossed images of the coins as directed under 
Experiment XXVIII, C, page 139. Without the screen, there will 
be seen an apparently solid and real coin and two shadowy images 
on each side of it; with the screen, the combined coin remains and 
the shadowy images are shut off. 
Diagram XIX represents the eyes binocularly adjusted to the 
point #. Nearer than this point are two objects represented 
by a cross and a circle. When the cross and the circle are 
exactly on the ray lines of the point binocularly fixated, the 
cross casts its image upon the fovea centralis of the right eye, 
and the circle casts its image upon the fovea centralis of the 
left eye. If the images are from similar objects, for example, 
the two coins, they will fuse into the image of an apparently 
single and solid object. A screen extending outward from the  
-P-A-G-E-178
  142 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
root of the nose will cut off the heteronomous images. This 
screen is represented obstructing the ray lines from the cross to 
the left eye and from the circle to the right eye. 
The right eye’s image of the cross is projected along the line 
extending from the fovea centralis of the right eye to the point 
‘ of fixation, /; the left eye’s image of 
\ F the circle is projected along the line 
t \ extending from the fovea centralis of

ation. The diagram represents the 
two images superimposed or com- 
\ bined, as the case may be, at the 
' point of fixation where the two lines 
of projection intersect. This point 
of intersection does not, however, 
determine the distance at which the 
‘Screen combined image will be seen, but 
Ai only its direction. The object will

tion and combination of the bined image will be approximately monocular images of objects é q 
situated between the point the distance of the two objects pro- 
of binocular fixation and the ducing the monocular images. The 
ve direction of the binocular image is 
determined by the point of intersection of the monocular lines 
of projection. The locality of the point of intersection is deter- 
mined by the amount of convergence of the two eyes necessary 
for binocular adjustment to the distance of the point of fixation. 
The distance of the binocular image is dependent to some 
extent upon the amount of convergence also, but it is chiefly 
determined by other and more general conditions of space- 
perception already given consideration in this chapter.

“ PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 143 
If the point of fixation is nearer than the two objects which are 
to be binocularly combined (see Diagram XX), a double screen, 
one for each eye, or a single screen with a central opening, 
must be employed. The point 
of fixation represented in the 
diagram is in the opening 
of the screen; the cross casts 
its image upon the center of 
the retina of the right eye, 
and the circle casts its image 
upon the center of the retina 
of the left eye; the projec- 
tion lines of the two images 
intersect at the point of fixa- 
tion. The ray line from the 
circle to the right eye, and 
the ray line from the cross 
to the left eye are obstructed 
by the screen; the forma- 
tion of homonomous images 
is thereby prevented. If the os Dracram XX. The superposition and com-

B. The successive combination of the monocular images of the 
parts of an object. Hold a rod or a pencil horizontally before 
the eyes and pointing straight out from the root of the nose. 
Look at the farther end of the rod and observe the appearance of 
the rest of the rod. Fixate the nearer end and then the middle 
of the rod, observing the manner of doubling. Try with a thin 
long book, looking along the back. Can more than one point along 
the back of the book or the length of the rod be seen single at 
one time ? 
C. The perception of a three-dimensional object, possessing 
apparent solidity and reality, from the binocular combination of 
Slat or two-dimensional pictures and diagrams. 
1. Combine binocularly, from the parallel position of the lines 
of sight, the two views of the hall of a museum of art represented 
on Chart 38. Employ the median screen, if necessary, being 
careful that neither view is too much shaded by the screen. Com- 
bine binocularly the two views of the Italian peasants on the road 
to market. The combination of stereoscopic views with the naked 
eyes, without the assistance of the stereoscope, is accomplished by 
some with ease, but by others only with great difficulty. After the 
practice in binocular and monocular adjustment obtained from the 
preceding experiments, the student should combine without much 
trouble one or the other pair of stereoscopic views. After the 
lines of sight are nearly parallel, the right eye looking at the view 
to the right and the left eye at the one to the left, it is helpful 
to imagine oneself looking far off into the distant background of 
the scene. 
The experiment with the rod and the book shows that when 
one part of an object is fixated, the parts that are nearer and 
farther away are seen double. When the nearer end of the 
rod or book is fixated, the double images appear ’; when the 
farther end is fixated, they appear A ; when a median point 
is fixated, they appear xX. No object that has depth, ie, that

extends along a line straight out from the eyes, can be seen 
single in its entirety at any one time. It also appears from 
these experiments that the right eye’s image of such an object 
is somewhat different from the left eye’s image. The binocular 
perception of real objects extended in three dimensions requires, 
therefore, that the component parts of slightly dissimilar images 
be combined in rapid succession. The movements of attention 
and the eyes described in Chapter III, page 61, are those 
involved chiefly in the perception of two dimensions, #.e., move- 
ments to the right and left and up and down over such parts 
of an object as are at the same distance from the eyes. The 
perception of the third dimension involves the eye movements 
necessary for converging the lines of sight successively upon 
the several parts of the object that are at different distances 
from the eyes. 
The flat or two-dimensional views of the interior of the 
museum of art are slightly dissimilar. The distance sepa- 
rating the two pictures of an object in the background is greater 
than that separating those of an object in the foreground. 
When the views are binocularly combined from the parallel 
position of the lines of sight, the eyes must be somewhat more 
converged to get a single image of the font in the foreground 
than to get a single’ image of the urn in the background. All 
the objects represented cannot be made single at one time. 
Careful observation may show that when an object in the fore- 
ground is single an object in the background gives overlapping 
double images. Slight movements of the eyes laterally over 
the surface of the views, bringing different objects into the 
center of most distinct vision, will be accompanied by changes 
in the amount of convergence necessary to make the images of 
the different objects single as well as distinct. As soon as the 
eyes are properly adjusted and the two views are being com- 
bined point for point in rapid succession, the flat pictures are 
transformed into a single and very realistic view of the scene; 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
OOO OOS.  
-P-A-G-E-185
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 147 
the illusion of gazing upon the actual objects portrayed in the 
pictures is often remarkably strong. The movements of the 
eyes are then very similar to those that would be produced 
were we looking at the three-dimensional objects of the scene 
represented, and not at their flat or two-dimensional pictures. 
The perception that results from the binocular combination of 
these pictures has a greater semblance of reality than the per- 
ception that results from directing the eyes to a single one of 
the two views. 
The stereoscope is an instrument that facilitates binocular 
combination, assisting the eyes to assume the requisite conver- 
gence and increasing the definition of the retinal images. The 
two pairs of slightly dissimilar views on Chart 88 are made 
from photographs prepared for use with a stereoscope. The 
reality and life-likeness of photographs combined, either with 
the stereoscope or with the naked eyes, are readily observed by 
most persons. Some, however, appear to get no more from 
stereoscopic photographs than from a flat picture. They see 
the picture but do not apperceive the scene represented, as 
one unfamiliar with the English language may distinguish the 
letters of this page and yet fail to apprehend the thought 
intended to be conveyed by the words. 
2. Combine with the lines of sight, either parallel or crossed, 
the circles of Chart 39, a. Is it possible to combine at one time in 
a single perception both the larger and the smaller circles? Or is 
there an overlapping of the one pair of circles when the other 
is single? Does the combined smaller circle appear to be in the 
same plane, ie. at the same distance, as the combined larger 
circle? 
The centers of the two smaller circles are nearer together 
than the centers of the two larger circles. It therefore requires 
greater convergence from the parallel position to combine the 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  148 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
smaller circles than to combine the larger circles. The com 
bined image of the smaller circles will in consequence appear 
to be nearer than the combined image of the larger circles. 
This may give rise to the perception of a funnel or truncated 
cone, the smaller end of which is directed toward the eyes. 
If the circles are combined with the lines of sight crossed, the 
smaller circles combine with less convergence than the larger 
circles, and, when combined, the smaller circle will appear to be 
farther away than the larger circle. If the perception of a solid 
object results from such combination, you will seem to be look- 
ing into the interior of a funnel, the small end of which is 
directed away from you. 
3. Combine the two figures of Chart 39, d. 
The lines drawn from the smaller to the larger circles should 
increase the apparent reality of the perception resulting from 
binocular combination. If the eyes are steadily fixed upon the 
smaller circles, the images of the smaller circles exactly coincide, 
while the larger circles overlap and the straight lines connecting 
the two circles are also doubled. Many persons will be unable 
to observe the doubling of points not fixated, because the eyes 
change their convergence so rapidly that as soon as any one 
part of the diagram is given the least attention, the binocular 
adaptation for this part follows, and the part instantly becomes 
single. When these figures are binocularly combined, they 
cause a successive fusion of the component parts of dissimilar 
images and thus realize the conditions that are produced when 
an actual funnel is viewed with the two eyes. 
4. Combine the two figures of Chart 39, c. 
In ¢ of Chart 40 the centers of the smaller circles are farther 
apart than the centers of the larger circles. When these figures 
are combined from the parallel position, the small circles require 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 149 
for their combination a less amount of convergence than the 
large circles. In consequence, their coinciding images combine 
in a plane more distant than the plane of combination of the 
larger circles. From the parallel position, the combined image 
is the perception of the inside of a funnel, the small end of 
which is directed away. Crossed combination produces the oppo- 
site perception of a funnel seen from the outside, the smaller 
end being directed toward the eyes. 
Experiment XXXI. The advantage of binocular over monocular 
vision. 
A. Mark a spot on a sheet of paper with a pencil point. Place 
on the table before a subject, and require him to touch the spot 
with the point of a pencil held in the right hand. Make ten trials 
with (a) both eyes, (6) the right eye, (c) the left eye. Use a 
different spot for a, 6, and c, and change the position of the paper 
somewhat after each trial. Let the subject drop his hand to his 
side after each trial, and endeavor to touch the spot with a single 
movement. The distance of the mark made by the subject from 
the given spot will measure the subject’s error. Obtain the average 
error for each of the three series of ten trials. Compare by 
means of the three average results the relative accuracy with both 
eyes and with the right or left eye alone. 
The errors made are composed of an error of vision and an 
error of codrdination in the movement of the right hand toward 
the spot located by vision... The latter error remains constant 
throughout the three series; differences in the average errors, 
therefore, indicate the relative accuracy of vision with both eyes 
and with each eye alone. 
B. The error due to the arm movement is eliminated by the 
Hering binocular test, which permits of the comparison of an 
unknown nearer or farther distance with a constant distance. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    150 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
apparatus consists of a partial screen for the two eyes, through 
which the subject looks straight ahead at a black ball suspended 
upon a thread at the distance of about twelve inches from the eyes. 
Let the experimenter drop the white balls provided with the appa- 
ratus nearer or farther from the eyes than the ball fixated. The 
white ball must be dropped from a position at which it cannot 
be seen by the subject, and allowed to fall to the right or left 
of the black ball in order that his judgment may not be assisted 
by the intercepting images. As each ball is about to be dropped, 
let the experimenter say “Now” as a signal to the subject to 
fixate the black ball and to prepare to give a judgment on the 
relative distance of the falling white ball. Make ten trials with 
the white ball nearer, and ten trials with the white ball farther, 
than the black ball, with (a) both eyes; (6) the right eye; (c) the 
left eye. Record the number of errors and compare the relative 
accuracy of binocular and monocular vision. 
C. A substitute for the Hering binocular apparatus can easily 
be prepared by rolling a sheet of cardboard into a tube five inches 
in diameter and twenty inches long, tying the roll together at the 
ends with string, or binding in any other convenient fashion. At 
a distance of about fourteen inches from one end of the tube, pass 
a black thread across the diameter of the tube. The roll can then 
be held up before the eyes of the subject and the thread fixated © 
so that it is seen stretched horizontally across the tube through 
which the subject is looking. Above and below, cut out two slits, 
about two inches wide, and extending longitudinally for a distance 
of ten inches. The slits ought to extend equal distances in both 
directions from the thread. The white ball (a bullet, marble, or 
any small round object) may be dropped from above through the 
upper and lower slits, passing in front of or beyond the thread, 
and caught in the hand below or allowed to fall upon some soft 
material on the table to deaden the sound. A shoe button or bead 
may be strung on the thread to serve as the object of fixation, but 
this is not essential, as the subject may compare the relative dis- 
tances of the falling object and the bare thread. Instead of the 
tube of cardboard here suggested, a long, narrow paper box will
-P-A-G-E-189
  PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 151 
serve the purpose if the two ends are removed, a thread strung 
across the narrow section of the box, and slits cut in the top and 
bottom. 
To see an object and to locate it accurately in the space 
external to the body would seem to be a very simple matter 
until the conditions that determine the formation of visual per- 
ceptions are subjected to analysis. The experiments of this 
chapter have shown that these conditions are exceedingly com- 
plicated. And yet only the more important features of the 
“space” problem have been considered. It would carry us too 
far afield in psychological speculation if we should endeavor to 
state and answer all the questions that present themselves dur- 
ing the course of an examination of our perceptions of space. 
The facts and general principles of visual space perception, 
illustrated and discussed under the several experiments of this 
chapter, may be briefly stated in a concluding summary. 
1. The sensations due to the retinal image serve as the mental 
cue to which apperception responds with a complete space per- 
ception. Important elements of the experience which has 
formed apperception are: (a) the fact that the nearer of two 
objects may hide from view parts of the farther object; (6) the 
diminution in the size and clearness of the visual image as the 
distance of the object from the eyes becomes greater ; and (ec) 
the comparison of the object as otherwise known with its visual 
image and with the perception of other objects whose size is also 
known. This knowledge has been gained from visual percep- 
tions with one eye and both eyes in many different positions, 
and from perceptions received through other senses than that 
of vision. 
2. Although the object is never seen single in its entirety at 
any one moment of perception, it appears single because selective 
attention emphasizes the unity of the object and, in cases of 
double perception, may suppress one of the two images. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  152 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
is so marked that many persons fail to observe, until attention is 
called to them, the double perceptions which are received from 
nearly all other points than the one fixated. 
8. The single complete perception is not dependent on the 
visual images of the moment. It represents a fusion of suc- 
cessive mental contents, each one determined by the eye move- 
ments of convergence and direction necessary to bring the points 
of the object successively to single and clear perception. The 
perception of an object may be likened to a composite photo- 
graph which gives emphasis to the components that have 
been most pronounced and constant in the different pictures 
superimposed. 
4. A “space perception” is an association of many different 
mental contents, among which kinaesthetic sensations are the 
most important. The eye movements of convergence and 
direction, and the contraction of the ciliary muscle, give rise 
to associated kinaesthetic sensations which are interpreted in 
perception as definite location and distance. 
5. The rapid changes in convergence which are necessary to 
give rise successively to the single perception of the several 
parts of an object are accomplished automatically. With one 
point fixated, farther points have been shown to be homono- 
mously doubled and nearer points to be heteronomously doubled. 
This difference in the visual images of nearer and farther points 
suffices to originate the altered contraction of the muscles of 
the eye necessary to increase or decrease the amount of con- 
vergence as may be required to bring a nearer or a farther point 
to singleness of perception. At the close of Chapter IJ, in 
considering the direction of the lines of sight of the two eyes 
upon an object that is casting its images on the lateral por- 
tions of the retinae, a distinction was made between automatic 
movements accompanied by consciousness and automatic move- 
ments without consciousness. The two eyes constitute a single 
complex mechanism for the adjustment of convergence as well
-P-A-G-E-191
  
PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE 153 
as for that of direction. As in the case of the direction of the 
lines of sight, so also with respect to convergence, it is often 
impossible in a given instance to ascertain whether conscious- 
ness has been a necessary factor in determining the physio- 
logical adjustment. It can, however, be demonstrated that in 
some cases these movements take place automatically and 
without consciousness, but in other cases are controlled by 
consciousness and volition. 
6. The character, size, and relative clearness of the retinal 
image also contribute to the spacial perception of objects local- 
ized in the field of vision. Those mental elements of the per- 
ception which are due solely to the retinal image are most 
appropriately designated retinal sensations. The sensations 
attributed to the eye, under the name of visual sensations, are 
in reality composed of both retinal and associated kinaesthetic 
sensations. Even the simplest retinal sensations, for example 
those of color, are experienced only as the component parts of 
complexer perceptions. If we could have the retinal sensation 
“red” existing alone in consciousness, it would be necessary 
for us to experience redness without apparent size and location. 
A sensation, psychologically considered, is an abstraction of 
analysis. It is the simplest element which can be conceived of 
as forming a part of complexer contents. The chapters of the 
Manual to follow will consider the simpler aspects of the mental 
element of perception.

PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
Exrrriment XXXII. Variations in the process of sensation. 
A. Procure two cards of the same size, ¢.g., visiting cards. 
Notch an edge of each card so that the two notched edges present 
a saw-toothed appearance. Apply the two notched edges to the 
skin of the forearm. Do the two edges seem of the same length? 
Cut from the notched edge of one card all but the two end teeth. 
Apply the notched edge and the edge with the two separated teeth 
to the forearm. Which seems the longer? Why ? 
B. Apply a pair of dividers or calipers (or a notched card) to 
the cheek with the points about three-quarters of an inch apart. 
Move them over the surface of the cheek toward the mouth so that 
one point traverses the surface of the upper lip and the other 
that of the lower. Does the distance between the points seem to 
increase as they are moved from the cheek toward the lips? 
C. Get a straw or slender strip of wood about six inches long. 
Paste two squares, or circles, of white paper and of the same size, 
one to each end of the straw. Grasp the straw in the middle with 
the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and hold up before the 
right eye. Close the left eye and look at the two white squares so 
that the one to the left is in the center of the field of vision, and 
the one to the right is off to one side. Does the one seen in 
indirect vision seem larger than the one seen in direct vision? If 
you move the straw about, does the square seen in indirect vision 
appear to move more rapidly ? 
These perceptions of variable size are determined under con- 
ditions excluding other sources of variation than the respective 
touch and visual sensations; they serve to demonstrate the 
dependence of space perceptions upon the process of sensation.

Experiment XXXIII. Local variations in the quality and inten- 
sity of sensation. 
A. Sensations of heat and cold. Hold a piece of ice in the 
palm of the hand, on the back of the hand, against the forehead, 
the cheek, and in the mouth. Does the intensity of the cold and 
the pain vary in the different localities? Touch with a piece of 
heated metal the finger tip, the palm and back of the hand, the 
forehead, the lips, and the tongue. Place the entire hand in iced 
water; do you get a more intense sensation of cold from the palm 
or back of the hand ? 
B. The sensation of pain. With the Cattell pressure algometer 
determine the least amount of pressure producing pain on: (a) the 
ball of the thumb of the right hand; (0) the ball of the thumb of 
the left hand; (c) the middle line of the forehead ; (d) the forehead 
to the right of the middle line; (e) the crown of the head. Apply 
the algometer, increasing the pressure gradually until the subject 
notices that the pressure is just becoming painful. Record the 
minimum pressure for each locality in kilograms as read upon the 
scale of the instrument. Make five measurements in each locality 
and get average results. 
C. Sensations of color — the color fields. Let the subject fixate 
with one eye a point marked upon the blackboard or a large sheet 
of white or medium gray paper fastened against the wall. The 
eye should be only a few inches distant from the mark fixated. 
Draw intersecting vertical and horizontal lines through the point 
of fixation. Cut out a square, a half-inch on a side, from a standard 
red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white paper (¢.g., Charts 9-14). 
Attach each square to the end of a pencil or straw. Hold one of 
the four colored squares considerably to the right of the point 
fixated, and then move it slowly along the horizontal line toward 
the point of fixation. Let the subject announce as soon as he 
sees something. As the paper is moved inward let him continue 
repeatedly to announce the color that he thinks he sees (some 
colors appear to undergo characteristic changes as they approach 
the center of the field), until the point is reached at which he is 
absolutely certain of the color. Mark on the horizontal line the 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  156 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
point at which the subject first recognizes the color employed. 
Make two trials with each of the four colors, and, as a check 
experiment, use the black and the white squares. Which of the 
four colors can be seen farthest from the point of fixation? What 
is the order of visibility of the colors from the center of the field 
outward ? 
Determine by a similar procedure the farthest points at which 
each color can be discriminated along the horizontal line to the 
left, and along the vertical line above and below the point of 
  Dracram XXI. The color fields of the left eye. 
fixation. Is the order of visibility the same in the four linear 
directions from the center of the field? Care must be had that 
the eye is not moved; all results should be discarded in which a 
movement of the eyes has taken place or been suspected. 
Between the two points found for each color in each direction 
from the center, mark a median point; connect the four median 
points of each color by a line, drawing each color line with a crayon 
or pencil of the corresponding color. 
The field of color perception is less extensive than the field 
of vision (pages 50-52), The accompanying diagram represents
-P-A-G-E-195
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 157 
the color fields of the left eye, determined by the method 
of this experiment, except that the extreme points of color 
vision were ascertained along oblique lines as well as along the 
horizontal and vertical lines. An object in the external field 
of vision, colored in red, green, yellow, and blue, can be per- 
ceived in all its actual variety of color, only when it lies within 
the area or part of the external field bounded by the smallest 
line, the one marked “Green.” If the object lies beyond the 
area circumscribed by the line marked “ Red,” neither the red 
nor the green of such an object will produce the corresponding 
color sensations; these colors will appear as shades of gray. If 
such an object lies beyond the outermost line marked “ Yellow,” 
its yellow and blue coloration will also fail to produce sensa- 
tions of these respective colors, and the object will appear 
uncolored. The field of gray, or of white and black, is coter- 
minous with the field of monocular vision. 
These external areas of the field of vision correspond to 
sensitive areas of the retina. The color fields plotted by care- 
ful experimentation are not usually so regular in outline as 
those represented in the diagram above; they vary in extent 
with the size of the colored object, with the intensity of illumi- 
nation, and with other conditions. The fact remains, however, 
that the retinal limits for red-green vision are more restricted 
than those for yellow-blue vision and that both these areas are 
less extensive than the area of sensitivity for black, white, or 
gray. It is inferred from this fact that the perception of color 
must be dependent upon retinal structures that are not uni- 
formly distributed throughout the retina. The contrasting 
retinal sensations, red and green, yellow and blue, white and 
black, appear to be associated in pairs. This fact is accounted 
for on the supposition that there are three different retinal 
structures or elements, one of which is distributed throughout 
the entire sensitive area of the retina and when excited gives 
black and white, another less widely distributed giving yellow
-P-A-G-E-196
158 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
and blue, and a third restricted to a relatively small central 
area giving red and green. 
Experiment XXXIV. The distribution of areas of different 
sense qualities over the skin. 
A. The differentiation of heat and cold spots. 
1. Move the cool point of a lead pencil slowly and gently over 
the skin on the back of the hand or over the inner surface of the 
forearm. Do you notice that the cold sensation is distinct only on 
certain spots of the skin ? 
2. Heat the pencil point and test in the same way for heat spots. 
Which spots are the more easily detected, the heat or the cold 
spots ? 
B. The exact location of heat and cold spots. 
1. Mark off on some part of the body, e.g., the inner surface of 
the forearm, a twenty-millimetre (one-inch) square. Subdivide this 
square by cross-lines into 100 two-millimetre squares (64 one-eighth 
inch squares). Move the cool point of a pencil or blunt end of a 
needle over the skin through each of the small squares. Are you 
able to observe that the temperature sensations differ in quality 
in the different squares ? 
2. Perform the experiment, as above described, with the pencil 
point slightly heated. 
3. Make a diagram of your results by marking within corre- 
sponding squares drawn on paper the location of the heat and cold 
spots found. Mark the heat spots with red ink and the cold spots 
with black. Use a hand magnifying glass for fixing the exact 
locality of a heat or cold spot. 
C. The location and qualitative differentiation of pressure 
spots. Take a match stick sharpened to a point and test on an 
area of the forearm, marked as in B, for pressure spots, touching 
the sharpened end of the match stick upon spot after spot of the 
skin. What differences in pressure sensation do you detect when 
different spots are stimulated ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 159 
Every spot on the surface of the skin is not equally capable of 
giving rise to all the sensations that may be excited by the stimu- 
lation of the skin. The accompanying diagram represents an 
area about ten millimetres square on the skin at the base of the 
forearm in which have been located all the sense spots of heat, 
cold, and pressure, Figs. a, b, and d, respectively. These spots 
are referred for purposes of comparison to the distribution of 
the hairs in the same area, Fig. c. The distribution of the sense 
spots, as shown in the diagram, gives to the skin the appearance

of a mosaic of diverse sensitive areas. If the cold spots alone 
could be removed from this area, sensations of heat and touch 
would arise from contact with a hot object, but only a sensation 
of touch from contact with a cold object ; and yet, when a cold 
object is in contact with the skin, all portions of the skin touched 
seem to give rise to the cold sensation. There is no break in the 
sensations corresponding to the actual gaps in the sensitive areas. 
A similar discontinuity of sensory surface is found in the 
retina also. The sensitivity of the retina is dependent upon 
the rods and cones. Fig. a of Diagram XXIII represents the 
distribution of the cones of the fovea centralis; Fig. 6 of the 
same diagram, the distribution of the rods and cones in a periph- 
eral portion of the retina. Between the cones of the fovea 
centralis there are small interstices. In the lateral portions of 
the retina, the cones are more widely separated, and, although 
the rods are placed quite close together, forming a palisade, 
there are also non-sensitive spaces between them. A continuous 
blue surface acting upon the retina will stimulate discontinuous 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
  160 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
sensitive rods and cones. The continuous sensation that results 
is to be attributed to the smallness of the interstices as compared 
with the sensitive points. It will 
be remembered in this connection 
that adjacent sensations are con- 
tinued over even the large non- 
sensitive area of the blind spot.

D. The discrimination of small differences in sensations of touch 
—the so-called sensory circles. Provide yourself with a pair of 
blunt calipers or compasses, and with a millimetre or foot rule. 
(An aesthesiometric compass prepared for the purpose may be 
obtained.) Touch the two points to the skin; be careful to apply 
them simultaneously ; do not press upon the skin and avoid touch- 
ing the hairs as much as possible. Require the subject to close 
his eyes and to announce whether he has been touched by two points 
or one. Make a preliminary experiment with the points close 
together, and another with the points quite far apart. When the 
points are close together, the subject will observe a single touch 
only; when. they are very far apart, he will observe two. 
Touch the skin with the points so far apart that the subject is 
quite certain that he has been touched by two points. Make a 
series of trials, bringing the points after each trial somewhat closer
-P-A-G-E-199
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 161 
together, until the subject makes an error by calling the two points 
one. Make another trial without decreasing the distance between 
the points. If the subject a second time judges the two points to 
be one, measure in millimetres the distance between the points.and 
record this distance as the “just unnoticeable distance.” 
Make another series of trials, beginning this time with the points 
so close together that the subject is in no doubt as to the single- 
ness of the sensation of touch received from them. Gradually 
increase the distance between the points until the subject in two 
successive trials correctly judges the two points as two. Record 
this distance as the “just noticeable distance.” 
In making the two series of experiments, touch the subject 
occasionally with but a single point, that he may never be certain 
whether he is actually touched with two points or only one. This 
is a “control” experiment; it compels the subject to rely entirely 
upon his sensations in giving his judgments. 
Make five series of trials by each method of procedure, and 
calculate from them the average unnoticeable and the average 
noticeable distance. Average these two; this average result is the 
“threshold of sensory discrimination.” 
Determine the threshold in several selected regions of the body; 
for example, on (a) the outer surface of the left forearm, (6) the 
inner surface of the left forearm, (c) the back of.the left hand, 
(d) the palm of the left hand, (e) the tip of the first finger of 
the left hand, (f) the forehead. Determine for each locality the 
threshold “lengthwise” and a separate threshold “crosswise” the 
selected part of the body. Do not make the five experiments of 
each set successively, but proceed from an experiment in one set to 
an experiment in another set, in this order: (1), just unnoticeable 
distance, lengthwise; (2), just noticeable distance, lengthwise ; 
(8), just unnoticeable distance, crosswise; (4), just noticeable dis- 
tance, crosswise. Calculate the average values. Do your results 
show discrimination to be better lengthwise than crosswise? Does 
the fineness of discrimination vary in different regions of the body ? 
When adjacent points of the skin are touched, the sensa- 
tions of touch are very similar in quality. The points touched 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
162 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
must be separated by a certain distance, if they are to give rise 
to two sensations distinguishably different in quality. If one 
end of a pair of compasses is placed upon any point of the 
body and a circle of sufficient radius is drawn, all points within 
its circumference will give rise to a sensation not distinguish- 
ably different from that received from the point of the skin at 
the center of the circle. All points on the skin beyond the 
circle will give rise to sensations that are noticeably different in 
quality from the sensation received from the point at the center 
of the circle. The radius of this circle can be ascertained by 
the methods of this experiment. The sensory area included 
within the circumference of such a circle has been called a 
“sensory circle.” The circle is drawn out in the direction of 
the long axis of the body or limb, the area being strictly not 
circular but elliptical. The areas are more nearly circular early 
in life than later. This is probably due to the greater growth 
of the body and its members in the longitudinal than in the 
transverse direction. 
The stimulation of the surface of the skin results in sensa- 
tions of touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain, depending upon 
the character of the stimulus and its mode of application. The 
stimulus acts either directly upon a nerve fibre or indirectly 
upon a sense organ connected with the nerve fibre. In either 
case the effect of the physical stimulation is a physiological 
excitation of the nerve fibre which is ultimately conducted 
to the outer surface, or cortex, of the cerebral hemispheres of 
the brain. A limited region of the cortex is the central cere- 
bral center for the sensations of this group, other regions being 
the centers of taste, smell, hearing, and seeing, respectively. A 
stimulus cannot produce a sensation, unless it is conducted to 
its appropriate center. The nerve fibres are the processes or 
prolongations of nerve cells. A single nerve cell and connected 
fibre conduct the physiological excitation from a sense organ or 
from the free ending of the nerve to the spinal cord or base of 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 163 
the brain. Other nerve cells with their fibre processes conduct 
the physiological excitation to the nerve cells in the respective 
center of the cortex. The physiological process of sensation 
involves, in most cases, a sense organ, several nerve cells and 
fibres of conduction, and the nerve cells of the cortical center. 
The various sensations received from the stimulation of the skin 
and deeper seated structures 
are qualitatively distinct from 
oneanother. Heat spots, cold 
spots, and perhaps also pres- 
sure spots can be distin- 
guished and separated on the 
surface of the skin. It is 
natural to expect, in conse- 
quence, that there are differ- 
ent sense organs, nerve fibres ‘ PB 
of conduction and nerve cells pa mn eee 
  in the cortex, for the several 
sensations of this group. The Drscram XXIV. The free ending of a

experimental evidence does otitis: 
not, however, positively estab- 
lish the existence of different sense organs, nerve cells, and 
nerve fibres for each of the sensations of the group. 
The nerve cell represented in black in Diagram XXIV has 
its fibre terminating freely among the cells, outlined by the 
broken lines, which are the structural elements of the skin. 
The cell also sends a branch of its fibre toward the central 
nervous system, #.e., the spinal cord or brain. In the pathway of 
conduction are other nerve cells and fibres, not shown in the 
diagram, which bring the physiological excitation to the cells 
of the cortical center. The physical stimulus acts directly 
upon the free endings of the nerve fibre. 
A sense organ is composed of one or more specialized cells, 
in close connection with which the peripheral end of the nerve

fibre terminates. Fig. 6 of Diagram XXYV is one of the sim- 
plest of these structures. It is an end bulb found in the con- 
junctiva of the eye, the mouth, and ligaments of the joints. 
The end bulb is composed of an outer wall forming an inner 
sack containing granular matter and nuclei. The nerve fibre 
may end within the bulb in 
various ways; in the one 
represented in the diagram, 
the two fibres enter the bulb 
and form a mesh of loops.

As many as fifty have been 
counted in a square millimetre (;'- of an inch) on the tip of the 
forefinger. Each corpuscle is composed of a large number of 
flattened cells; the cross-sections of these give the elliptical out- 
lines seen in the figure. One or more fibres terminate in a 
spiral twist about the corpuscle. Fig. ¢ represents another 
form of touch corpuscle found in the structures beneath the 
skin, near the joints and in the palmar surface of the hands 
and feet. Each corpuscle is built up of about fifty capsules 
concentrically arranged like the layers of an onion. The nerve 
fibre enters the corpuscle at one end and, cutting through all 
the capsules, terminates as a central stem or stalk. These 
structures are the simplest varieties of sense organs known. 
They are directly acted upon by the stimulus and in turn act 
upon the nerve fibre. Their function is to transform a physi- 
cal stimulus into a physiological excitation, which is then 
conducted by nerve fibres to the brain. Their location protects 
them from excessive and destructive stimulation and from other 
stimuli than those for which they are specially adapted.

EXxpERIMENT XXXY. The distribution of the sense organs of taste. 
Prepare solutions of (a) sugar, (6) quinine, (c) vinegar or acid, 
and (d) salt, of a strength that makes each solution just recogniz- 
able to the taste as sweet, bitter, acid, and salt, respectively. Dip 
a fine camel’s-hair brush in one of the four solutions thus prepared. 
Let the subject open his mouth wide and thrust out the tongue as 
far as possible. Dry the tongue to prevent the solution from 
running and rinse out the mouth after each test. With the camel’s- 
hair brush, touch individual'fungiform papillae, the dark red spots 
upon the tongue; touch the large round circumvallate papillae 
arranged like a A near the back of the tongue; touch also the 
sides, tip, and root of the tongue. Try with all four solutions.

  Exrertment XXXVI. The tone sensation. 
A. Quality or pitch. Strike in succession two or more tuning- 
forks or several keys of the piano. In what respect do these tones 
differ? What is the meaning of higher and lower? What is 
pitch? Is there a continuous series of tone sensations from the 
lowest possible tone to the highest ? 
B. Intensity. Hold a vibrating tuning-fork close to the ear 
and then at arm’s length. In what respects does the sensation of 
tone vary under these conditions? Has every sensation of tone a 
distinctive quality and intensity? Strike a tuning-fork a sharp 
blow and let the sound gradually die away. Is there a continuous 
series of intensities from the loudest to the weakest tone ?
-P-A-G-E-205
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 167 
C. The sympathetic vibration of sounding bodies. Place on the 
table two tuning-forks of the same pitch and one of different pitch. 
Strike one of the two similar forks vigorously. Stop the vibration 
of the fork that has been struck. Observe that the other fork of 
the same pitch is vibrating and gives rise to a tone sensation, 
whereas the third fork of different pitch is motionless and silent. 
When a note is struck on an instrument or sung near a piano, observe 
that some of the strings of the piano are thrown into vibration and 
others remain unmoved. 
Touch the finger to a vibrating fork or to the vibrating string of 
a piano and observe that the vibrations give rise to a tingling 
sensation. 
Sound sensations due to such vibrating bodies as a tuning-fork 
or the strings of a piano are called tone sensations. If we start 
with a tone sensation from any one string of the piano, we can, 
by striking adjacent strings, produce a series of tone sensations 
which will differ from the first either in quality, called pitch, 
or in intensity. (For the consideration of quality, in the sense 
of timbre, see page 196.) All possible tone sensations may be 
arranged along a con- 
tinuous line. This

possible pitch to a 
tone of the highest possible pitch. If the strings of the piano 
were more numerous, we might pass from the lowest to the 
highest pitch by quite insensible gradations or changes in the 
quality of the tone sensations. Each tone sensation may also 
vary with respect to its intensity. If we represent the continu- 
ous qualities of tone sensation by a horizontal line, we may 
represent the variations in the intensity of each tone by a

rectangular surface, Diagram XXVIII, will contain all possible 
variations of tone sensations, and graphically represents the fact 
that tone sensations constitute a continuous series of variable 
qualities and intensities. 
The physical stimulus is a body vibrating a constant number 
of times per second. If the surface of the skin is touched 
once a second, a single touch sensation will result. If it is

tapped two or three times a second, an equal number of rapidly

stimulus can no longer give rise to a distinct sensation; the 
mental result will be a sensation of tingling or roughness. 
The physiological processes, which are excited by the rapidly 
intermittent stimulations, are fused before they give rise to the

sensation. A sounding object strikes at constant intervals a 
mechanical blow upon the air adjacent to it. If these blows 
are as frequent as 8 per second and not more than 40,000 per 
second, they may produce a sensation of tone having a pitch 
determined by the number of impulses per second. The dis- 
turbance of the atmosphere is propagated from the layer of air 
adjacent to the source of vibration, by a wave motion, to the 
layer of air in the external auditory canal adjacent to the tym- 
panum (see Diagram XXIX). This layer of the atmosphere will 
impart to the tympanum a series of rapidly intermittent shocks. 
From the tympanum of the outer ear the physical vibration is 
conducted across what is known as the middle ear by the three 
ear ossicles, the malleus or hammer, the ineus or anvil, and the 
stapes or stirrup. The base or tread of the stirrup, projecting 
through the fenestra ovalis, an oval opening, communicates the 
vibration to the complex inner ear, known as the labyrinth. 
(See Diagram XXX.) The labyrinth is a bony cavity contain-

several structures, of which we shall consider only those essen- 
tial to hearing. The most important structure is the basilar 
membrane, which is shown in the middle turn of the winding 
canal in Diagram XXXI. The basilar membrane is composed 
of about 24,000 fibres, upon which are situated the rods of 
Corti, rising from the membrane and joining at their upper 
extremities to form a small tunnel over the membrane. Dia- 
gram XXXII represents a cross-section of the basilar mem- 
brane, with an outer and an inner rod forming an arch over the 
membrane. Close to the outer rods of Corti and external to 
them are four rows of hair cells, and internal to the inner 
rod is a single row of hair cells. These hair cells are in 
connection with the termination of the fibres of the auditory 
nerve. The fibres of the basilar membrane are supposed to 
be thrown into vibration by an external sound wave in the

same manner that one tuning-fork starts into sympathetic 
vibration a second fork of the same pitch. The membrane has 
therefore been called an inner piano. Some have thought that 
the rods of Corti also vibrated sympathetically in response to 
the external stimulus, but it is generally believed that their 
function is to dampen the vibration of the fibres upon which

These are the four rows of outer hair cells and the single row of inner hair

structures are placed upon and supported by the basilar membrane, which is 
seen in cross-section below. The nerve fibre of hearing terminates at the base 
of and about the outer and inner hair cells. It is a process from a nerve cell, 
situated in the cochlea, and sending another process to terminate in the brain. 
From the central termination of the auditory nerve at the base of the brain, 
other nerve cells and fibres conduct the physiological excitation to the center 
of hearing in the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres. 
they are placed. It is probable that the hair cells are also 
thrown into vibration by. the liquid of the membranous laby- 
rinth into which the hairs project. It can be said with cer- 
tainty that the liquid, the rods, and the fibres of the basilar 
membrane are the structures one or all of which take up the 
physical sound vibration and in some mechanical way act upon 
the outer and inner hair cells. These cells are therefore the 
physiological organs, ¢.e., the true sense organs of tone sensation, 
for when these are physiologically excited by the physical stimu- 
lus brought to them by way of the endolymph, the perilymph, 
the ear ossicles and the tympanum, they transform the physical 
stimulus into a nervous excitation by acting upon the terminals 
of the auditory nerve fibres. The sense of hearing is called a 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  172 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
mechanical sense because of this direct relation of the stim- 
ulus to the sense organ, namely, the hair cells. Practically 
nothing is known of the physiological processes that take place 
in the sensory cells. In consequence of this, the psycho-physi- 
ology of sound sensations is as yet of relatively small importance, 
whereas the psycho-physics of sound, which analyzes the rela- 
tion of the sound sensation to the physical stimulus, has been 
greatly developed through the work of Helmholtz and others. 
The absence of any facts connecting tone sensations with defi- 
nite physiological processes causes a further discussion of these 
sensations to be less appropriate in this chapter than in the 
chapter on the psycho-physical analysis of sensation. 
Experiment XXXVII._ Retinal sensations. 
A. The composite stimulus of the simple sensation of white. 
Observe the color of a sheet of white paper in the sunlight. Hold 
in the sunlight, above the paper, a glass prism. Notice the rainbow 
spectrum thrown upon the paper. 
If a sheet of paper appears to be white, it is because that 
particular piece of paper has the physical property of reflecting 
nearly all the rays of light, i.e., the wave motions of ether, 
which fall upon it, very much as the banks of a river reflect or 
send back the wave motions of the water due to a passing 
steamboat. The medium corresponding to the water is the 
ether, which is supposed to fill all space. A source of illumi- 
nation, the sun for example, sets the ether vibrating at differ- 
ent rates. Vibrations of about 450 million million per second 
give rise to the sensation of red; vibrations of 800 million 
million per second give rise to the sensation of violet; vibra- 
tions of intermediate frequency give rise to the intermediate 
color sensations of the spectrum; 526 million million vibrations 
per second give rise to the sensation of yellow, 589 to green,

640 to blue, and 790 to violet. If ether rays of all these 
rates of vibration act at the same time upon the retina, 
they will produce the simple sensation of white. There exist, 
also, vibrations of less frequency than 400 million million per 
second, which do not give rise to retinal sensations even though 
they may fall upon the retina. When they act upon the sur-

face of the body, they give rise to sensations of heat and cold 
respectively, depending upon their relation to the temperature 
of the part of the body stimulated. These vibrations are distin- 
guished, as heat rays, from the vibrations which give rise to 
retinal sensations, which are known as light rays. Vibrations 
of greater frequency than 800 million million per second also 
produce no retinal sensations. They exert a chemical effect, if 
they act at all upon the various organs and tissues of the body, 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
    174 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
and are known as chemical rays. The effect of light rays 
upon the rods and cones and pigment cells is also a chemical 
one. Vision has therefore been designated a chemical sense. 
The exact nature of this chemical action is not yet known. 
The physiological processes which are excited in the retina, so 
far as these are understood, will be considered shortly. 
The prism separates the rays of different frequency of vibra- 
tion. Diagram XXXIII represents a composite bundle or beam 
of rays directed upon the surface of a triangular prism. These 
rays are bent from their course or refracted by the prism, the 
amount of refraction being proportional to the rate of vibration. 
Rays of least frequency are refracted least, and those of great- 
est frequency most. When these rays are thus separated by 
the prism into a band of rays in which, as shown in the dia- 
gram, those of least frequency are at one end and those of 
greatest frequency at the other, with rays of intermediate fre- 
quency arranged in regular order between them, the light rays 
falling upon a sheet of white paper give rise to the character- 
istic band of spectral colors. 
B. The mixture of colored pigments and the fusion of the physi- 
ological processes in the retina. Prepare three discs of white 
paper, by painting one of them with a blue pigment, another with 
a yellow pigment, and a third with an equal mixture of the two 
pigments. Have the discs of the same size and capable of adjust- 
ment to the color top or wheel. Place the yellow and blue discs 
together on the top, so that one-half of each disc shows. Spin the 
top rapidly and note the resultant sensation of color. Compare 
the sensation thus obtained from the yellow and the blue on the 
color top with that obtained from the two pigments physically 
mixed and painted upon the disc. 
The apparatus suggested for use in this and the following 
experiments is the Bradley Color Top. This instrument, as 
shown in the diagram, consists of a spindle upon which can
-P-A-G-E-213
  
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 175 
be slipped a cardboard disc held in place by a wooden yoke 
fitting closely over the axis of the spindle. The top can easily 
be spun upon the table by giving it 
the proper twist with the fingers. 
Accompanying the top are paper discs 
of standard colors, somewhat smaller 
than the cardboard disc. Projecting 
beyond the edge of the colored discs, 
when these are fastened down with 
the yoke, are seen the ends of radii 
which divide the circumference of the

cardboard disc into twenty parts, thus providing means for 
measuring the relative amount of each color exposed. Slit 
each disc from the circumference to the 
center and slip one over the other, in 
the manner represented in Diagram 
XXXV, until the desired amount of 
each color is exposed. 
The color wheel is more convenient 
for class-room demonstration, especially 
Diagram XXXV. The ad- with small classes. This is a mechanical 
dee of the color device for rotating color discs uniformly 
and at a very high rate of speed. The 
color discs, made of cardboard, are adjusted in precisely the 
same way as with the color top. 
When yellow and blue pigments are mixed, they produce a 
green pigment. This is a physical mixture of colored substances. 
When yellow and blue discs are rotated rapidly on the color 
top, there is no physical mixture of the colors whatever. The 
rotation of the top causes each color to act in rapid succession 
upon the retina. Yellow and blue, when taken in proper 
proportion on the color top, give rise to a simple sensation of 
uncolored gray. Introspective analysis reveals in the sensation 
no trace of blue or yellow, nor yet of the green which resulted 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
  176 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
from a mixture of the pigments. If neither the physical stimulus 
nor the sensation shows signs of mixture, the physiological pro- 
cesses of the brain, retina, or the connecting sensory nerves must 
be responsible for this want of correspondence between the sen- 
sation and its yellow and blue stimuli. The physiological fusion 
due to the rapidly intermittent action of the yellow and blue 
stimulus is generally supposed to take place in the retina. 
This experiment serves to illustrate the distinction that always 
must be drawn between the respective processes that are the 
subject-matter of psychology, physiology, and physics. The 
same name may be applied to very different objects. The word 
“color”? may mean either the sensation or the physical object 
giving rise to the sensation. We must be careful to avoid 
inferring that conditions which are true of the stimulus are 
necessarily true of the sensation. A failure to regard the color 
sensation as distinct from the color stimulus has given red, 
yellow, and blue an unjustifiable preéminence. It is common 
to hear them spoken of as the three primary colors; because 
of this mistaken supposition, they are not infrequently taught 
in the schools before the other colors. For the purposes of 
painting, red, yellow, and blue are fundamental pigments, and 
green is a secondary color of composition, but for psychology, 
that is, for the mind, green is as much a primary color as are 
the others. ; 
C. The relation of retinal sensations to diminished illumination. 
Hold two colored papers, one a blue and the other a shade of 
blue, squarely to the light. Keeping the shade of blue in the full 
light, gradually turn the blue away, thus diminishing the amount 
of its illumination. Can you find a slant of the blue, namely, a 
certain degree of darkness, where the blue can be made exactly to 
match the shade ? . ts 
Try with a white and a gray paper, turning the white away from 
the light. Can you pass through insensible gradations from white 
to light gray, by diminishing the intensity of the illumination?
-P-A-G-E-215
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 177 
Do not all objects during the period of twilight gradually shade 
into black ? May we not pass by insensible gradations from white 
to black by diminishing the illumination? Is black a sensation, 
or is it only the absence of white? Do not colors tend to blanch 
or become whitish under intense illumination? Would it not be 
possible to pass from black, or any color, to white by intensifying 
the illumination? 
D. The relation of color sensations to white and black. 
1. Use a color top or wheel. Take ared disc and a white one. 
Place them on a color top or wheel so that very little of the white 
shows. Observe the resultant color sensation, when the disc is 
whirled or the top is spun rapidly. Is it still a sensation of red? 
Increase the amount of white that is allowed to show with the 
red. Observe the resultant color. Is it a whitish red — that is, a 
tint of red? 
Gradually increase the amount of white until you get what 
appears to you a pure white. Can you reach pure white by passing 
through successively more whitish tints of red? 
2. Use the red and a black disc. Can you pass from red to 
black by insensible gradations of shades of red? 
3. Combine a blue, yellow, or green disc with white and with 
black discs. Do all colors tint into white and shade into black ? 
Do you obtain a continuous series of insensible gradations from 
each color to white and to black? 
4, Try with a white disc and a black one. 
5. Combine a disc of any color with a gray one, or use, in place 
of the latter, black and white discs. Try several different colors 
and observe the result. 
The stimulus of the white sensation is a bundle of rays of 
many different vibration frequencies, reflected generally from 
the surface of some external object. As the reflected rays 
diminish in number, the surface of the object becomes darker 
and by insensible gradations may pass through gray to black. 
A black surface reflects relatively few rays, but such as are 
reflected are of different vibration rates. The sensation of black 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  178 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
is not the absence of the sensation of white. Both are equally 
definite and equally simple retinal sensations. White and black, 
as sensations, are the opposite ends of a continuous series of 
grays. It is now common to refer to this continuous series of 
white-black or gray sensations as a brightness sensation. The 
difference between black and white is a difference of quality and 
not a difference of intensity. The color sensations red, yellow, 
green, and blue are composites of a color quality and the bright- 
ness quality. A sensation of color may have its brightness 
increased or diminished either by adding white or black respec- 
tively, or by increasing or diminishing the illumination. The 
less the admixture of the brightness quality, the more distinc- 
tive is the color quality ; a color sensation with the least pos- 
sible admixture of brightness is said to be saturated. It is 
common for us to speak of a more or less intense gray, and a 
more or less intense red, meaning thereby that the more intense 
gray and red are nearer to white, and the less intense gray and 
red are nearer to black. Because we have seen that this 
approach to black is generally obtained by diminishing the 
intensity of illumination, we wrongly infer that retinal sensa- 
tions change in intensity also. This is another illustration of 
the application of a physical analogy to mental processes. 
Retinal sensations, unlike the tone sensation, do not possess 
intensity distinguishable from quality. 
E. Intermediate or mixed color sensations. Mix on the color 
top varying proportions of red and yellow. Is the resulting sen- 
sation both red and yellow, i.e., a mixture of the two, or is the 
sensation of orange as simple as are the sensations of red and 
yellow ? 
Mix on the color top varying proportions of red and blue, obtain-; 
ing a series of sensations of purple intermediate between the red 
and blue. Is it possible to pass by insensible gradations from red 
to yellow, to green, to blue, and back again to red, passing through 
the intermediate variations of orange, yellow-green, green-blue,
-P-A-G-E-217
  
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 179 
violet, and purple? How many totally different sensations of 
color are there in this closed series? How would you determine 
the number of distinguishably different sensations ? 
The color qualities from red through yellow, green, and blue 
back to red may be represented on a continuous line. To indi- 
cate that these color qualities are an uninterrupted series, a 
circle may be chosen as the line of graphic representation. If 
white is represented by the center of the circle, radial lines 
from the circumference of the circle to the center will represent 
the graduated series of color tints from each color to white. 
To represent black, a point in space above the disc may be 
taken ; lines from this point to the periphery of the circle will 
contain all shades of the spectral colors. A line drawn from 
the point that represents black to the center of the disc will 
contain the uncolored grays of the black-white series. In this 
way is developed the color cone, Diagram XXXVI, a figure 
within the continuous area of 
which are contained all pos- 
sible retinal sensations. The 
apex of this cone stands for 
black, the central axis of the 
cone represents all variations 
from white to black through 
intermediate grays; around 
the periphery of the base are 
the spectral colors and purple ; 
on the external curved surface 
of the cone are represented all 
possible combinations of these colors with black; the plane 
base of the cone contains all combinations of the spectral colors 
and white. 
The number of distinguishably different retinal sensations is 
very large. Titchener calculates that there are about thirty 
  Dracram XXXVI. The color cone. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  180 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
thousand ; according to other investigators, the number is much 
larger. The number of totally different color sensations is 
four — red, yellow, green, and blue. All other color sensations 
are combinations of these. Thus orange is readily perceived to 
be composed of red and yellow. It was quite unnecessary for 
Newton to distinguish and name seven colors of the spectrum, 
for the orange is clearly referable to the red and yellow, and the 
indigo and violet are scarcely distinguishable from blue. The 
number was chosen by Newton through a false analogy with 
the seven notes of the musical scale. He forced the analogy 
by distinguishing a greater number of colors than was neces- 
sary. In casting the eye over the spectrum, or in sorting colored 
worsteds and papers, the smallest number of colors that will 
make a satisfactory classification is four. These four colors may 
be called principal colors. Language bears evidence that the race 
has looked upon these as the distinctive colors. They were the 
first to receive special names. To designate variations of these 
colors, either composite names are used, as greenish-yellow, or 
the name of an object is taken, as orange and indigo-blue. In 
addition to these four specific color sensations are the sensations 
of black and white, constituting the opposite ends of the series 
of grays, and, in consequence, grouped together under the 
name of brightness sensation. 
F. The production of a sensation of uncolored gray by the com- 
bination of rays of color. 
1. Adjust on the color top a yellow and a blue disc in propor- 
tion to give a gray when the top is spun rapidly. Compare this 
with a gray obtained by combining black and white. 
2. Combine red, green, and blue in proportions to give a gray. 
3. Place on the color top dises of all the colors of the spectrum 
and find the proportions necessary to obtain a gray by composition. 
Two colors that in combination give rise to an uncolored 
gray are called complementary. This gray is not distinguishable
-P-A-G-E-219
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 181 
as a sensation from the gray that results from a combina- 
tion of black and white or of all the colors of the spectrum. 
The sensations that are produced by the multifarious colors of 
nature can be excited by red, green, blue-violet, and combina- 
tions of these. These colors, in consequence, have been called 
primary colors. Their significance as primary colors attaches 
only to the physiological processes of the retina, which are 
fused by the intermittent action of the stimuli on the top or 
wheel. For the purpose of developing color perception it is 
quite as mistaken to teach children in the schools that red, 
green, and blue are primary colors as it is to begin with the 
fundamental pigments of red, yellow, and green. The primary 
colors for the mind are the four principal colors—red, yellow, 
green, and blue. : 
G. The sensitivity of the retina to color stimuli. 
1. Place before the subject a collection of worsteds or papers of 
all colors. Require him to sort according to the dominant color 
tone. Note any hesitation in sorting, especially in the handling of 
tints of red and green. 
2. Use the color top or wheel. Place on the top a gray disc of 
medium intensity and a standard red disc, exposing only a very 
small portion of the red. Spin the top rapidly and ask the subject 
to observe the resultant color. He will probably judge the result- 
ant sensation to be an uncolored gray. Increase very gradually 
the amount of red exposed until you find the amount that the sub- 
ject is just capable of perceiving as a tingeing of the gray in the 
direction of red. The amount of red, i.e., the sector of the disc 
exposed, is to be measured in terms of the degrees of the circle. 
Repeat this with a green, a yellow, and a blue disc, finding the 
different proportions that are just noticeable. Do not let the sub- 
ject know which color is being mixed with the gray. In place of 
the gray disc, a white or a black one may be employed. 
Different subjects will disclose considerable differences in the 
amount of a color that can be just discriminated when thus 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  182 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
mixed with gray. A few will be quite uncertain in their judg- 
ments, even with a large amount of the color disc exposed. 
They are probably color blind. The most common form of 
color blindness appears as a difficulty in discriminating red 
from green, and is frequently called red-green blindness. Less 
common forms are blue-violet blindness and blue-yellow blind- 
ness. Total color blindness also occurs, though rarely. In a 
group of twenty men or boys at least one should be found 
sufficiently insensitive to red or green to be called red-green 
blind. It is said that only one in a thousand women can be 
thus designated color blind. It is to be noted that the most 
common form of color blindness is an insensitivity to red or 
green ; this corresponds with the smaller area of retinal sensi- 
tivity for these colors. (See pages 156-157.) 
Color theories concern themselves with the physiological 
processes of the retina. These theories are for the most part 
inferences from the psycho-physical facts of color relationships, 
many of which have been presented in the course of these experi- 
ments. The Young-Helmholtz theory is based upon the results 
of color fusion in the retina. Red, green, and violet in differ- 
ent proportions will give rise to all possible color sensations. 
The theory assumes in consequence three different elements or 
processes in the retina, one for each of these so-called primary 
color sensations. The Hering theory is based upon the psycho- 
logical significance of the six retinal sensations — red, yellow, 
green, blue, black, and white. Red and green are complemen- 
tary and contrasting ; so also are yellow and blue, and white 
and black. Red, yellow, and white are mentally distinguished 
as exciting colors, while green, blue, and black are considered 
quiet and restful. When an organ of the body is stimulated 
to perform its normal function, it tends through the continued 
exercise of that function to become exhausted. The chemical 
elements of which it is composed undergo a partial decomposi- 
tion or dissimilation. The organ receives from the blood the 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 183 
nutritive material through the assimilation of which its sub- 
stance is renewed and the organ chemically reconstructed. 
The Hering theory assumes the existence of three elementary 
retinal substances: a red-green element, a yellow-blue element, 
and a white-black element. Red and green alone affect the 
red-green element; yellow and blue, the yellow-blue element; 
and white and black, the white-black element. The more 
exciting color stimuli, red, yellow, and white, produce a decom- 
position or dissimilation of the elements upon which they act; 
the less exciting stimuli, green, blue, and black, favor and 
assist organic assimilation and reconstruction. The physio- 
logical processes are therefore six in number, corresponding to 
the six principal elementary retinal sensations — red, green, 
yellow, blue, white, and black. All other sensations due to 
the action of light upon the retina are the mental result of a 
combination of these processes. Hering’s theory, in one of the 
many modifications to which it has been subjected by psychol- 
ogists and physiologists, is more generally accepted at the 
present day than the Young-Helmholtz theory. 
Experiment XXXVIII. Kinaesthetic sensations. 
Let some one move your arm or hand or one of your fingers. Do 
you notice that the sensations of movement differ from those which 
you receive from the member when it is at rest ? 
Voluntarily move the same member or members. Does the 
kinaesthetic sensation of an active movement differ from that of 
a passive movement ? 
Press a muscle with considerable force, for example the ball of 
the thumb. Do you notice a dull sensation that appears to have 
its origin in the muscle? 
Attach a two or three pound weight by a string to the end of the 
middle finger; let the finger and attached weight hang down by 
your side. Do you notice a sensation of strain along the finger and 
arm? This sensation is due to the stretching of the tendons and 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  184 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
ligaments. With the eyes closed, lower the weight until it comes 
to rest upon some soft object placed to receive it. At the moment 
when the pull of the weight is removed, do you notice a push 
upward as though the string were rigid and had been thrust against 
the arm? Where is the push localized? This sensation of push 
is supposed to be due to the joints coming suddenly together after 
they have been slightly pulled apart by the weight. 
Describe the kinaesthetic sensations accompanying the reflex 
- movements of sneezing, coughing, and gaping. 
The physiological source of the kinaesthetic sensation is partly 
in the muscles, partly in the joints, and partly in the tendons, 
ligaments, and even the skin. Sensations arising from the move- 
ments of the body are frequently called muscular sensations, and 
sometimes a “muscle sense” is spoken of. This terminology 
gives a false emphasis to the physiological contribution of the 
muscles. It would be more appropriate to speak of the joint 
sense, as the sense organs and nerves in the joints are of greater 
importance in giving rise to the kinaesthetic sensation than are 
those in the muscles. The physiological source, however, is in 
reality a composite one. It is doubtful whether introspective 
analysis is able to reveal a corresponding complexity of the sen- 
sation. As the sensation of white is a simple sensation due 
to a composition of colored rays, so the kinaesthetic sensation 
can be attributed to no single sense organ nor to any single 
stimulus, but must be regarded as the simple mental result of 
the several physiological processes in the muscles, joints, ten- 
dons, and skin. The fusion is, therefore, a physiological one, 
taking place before the distinctive kinaesthetic sensation has 
existence in consciousness. 
EXPERIMENT XXXIX. Sensations of rotation and dizziness. 
Spin about quickly on the feet for a number of seconds. When 
you stop, do you notice sensations of rotation and dizziness, and
-P-A-G-E-223
  
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 185 
some unsteadiness in walking or standing? Jerk the head with a 
voluntary movement to the right and left, up and down. Do you 
have the same unpleasant sensation of giddiness ? 
Sensations of rotation and dizziness are associated with the 
disturbance of bodily equilibrium. The maintenance of equi- 
librium is dependent upon physiological processes which have 
three different sources: (1) the muscles, skin, and other struc- 
tures associated in bodily movement; (2) the eyes; and (8) the 
three semicircular canals (see Fig. XXX, page 169) situated at 
one end of the inner ear. At the bases of these canals are 
sensory cells connected with nerve fibres which constitute a 
branch of the auditory nerve. These cells and fibres seem to 
have no function in relation to hearing. A movement of the 
head disturbs the liquid of the labyrinth, ¢.e., the endolymph, 
and this in turn excites the sensory cells. Disease of the semi- 
circular canals produces disturbance of equilibrium, sensations 
of dizziness and nausea. The sensation of nausea is associated 
with the functions of the stomach, its particular source being 
the oesophagus. Sensations of rotation and dizziness cannot 
be ascribed to the semicircular canals alone ; they are probably 
the mental result of a fusion of different physiological processes, 
some originating in the canals, but others, like the kinaesthetic 
sensation, in the structures usually excited by bodily move- 
ments, and still others in the internal organs, which are reflexly 
stimulated by an intense excitation of the sensory cells in the 
canals, conducted first to the brain and then by efferent nerves 
to the oesophagus and other internal organs. 
ExpERIMENT XL. The relation of sensation to the movements of 
the stimulus and sense organs. 
A. Sensations from the stimulation of hairs. Touch single 
hairs on the back of the hand or fingers. Do you notice that some
-P-A-G-E-224
  186 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
hairs are shaken and bent without any sensation being produced, 
while others enable you to feel the slightest movement, some 
without any tickling, and others with a decided tickle sensation? 
B. The sensation of tickle. Tickle with a feather the skin of 
the palm of the left hand. Touch the same part with a single 
contact of the feather. Is the sensation of tickle qualitatively 
different from that of touch? 
C. The perception or sensation of motion on the surface of the 
skin. 
1. Let the subject close his eyes. Rest a pencil point gently on 
the subject’s forearm over a spot marked with pencil or ink. Move 
the point slowly and evenly (a) up, (6) down the arm, (¢) to the 
right, and (d) to the left. Make five experiments in each direction, 
choosing the direction of the movement at random. Require the 
subject to announce the fact of motion as soon as he perceives it. 
How far must the pencil point be moved before the subject feels 
its motion? Measure the distance in millimetres. Average the 
results. 
2. Make twenty experiments, according to the directions given in 
C, 1, but this time requiring the subject to announce the direction 
of the motion as soon as he perceives it. How far must the pencil 
be moved from the marked spot before its direction is perceived ? 
Measure the distance in millimetres. Average the results. Have 
the downward distances been greater than the upward? Those to 
the right greater than those to the left? If any erroneous judg- 
ments of direction are given, discard them and continue the experi- 
ment until the required number of correct judgments are obtained. 
Is movement perceived before its direction ? 
3. Compare these average values with the average distance at 
which two points can be just distinguished from one (Experiment 
XXXIV, D, page 160). 
These experiments show that certain sensations are depend- 
ent upon the way in which the stimulus moves over the body 
rather than upon the stimulus itself. The tickle sensation, for 
example, is distinctive. It is not composed of an aggregation
-P-A-G-E-225
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 187 
of touch sensations. The stimulus, however, is an object 
moving lightly over the skin, producing a series of rapidly 
intermittent touches. The sensation of tickle can be related 
neither to a specialized sense organ and nerve nor yet to any 
special stimulus. Its stimulus is a succession of intermittent 
touches acting upon the skin to stimulate the same nerves that 
mediate other sensations. The tickle sensation, like the sensa- 
tion of white, would seem to result from a fusion of physio- 
logical processes. 
The sensation of movement over the skin has probably a 
similar origin. Some psychologists, however, look upon the 
mental result of an object moving over the skin as a percep- 
tion of movement, an inference from touch sensations changing 
rapidly in local quality. But the simple mental result of a 
movement over the skin is very different from that of a single 
touch. Moreover a movement over an exceedingly small 
stretch of surface will give rise to the movement sensation, 
whereas two touch stimuli separated by a much greater dis- 
tance give rise to touch sensations that are alike in quality. 
ExpPeRIMENT XLI. The relation of sensation to general physio- 
logical conditions. 
A. The amount of surface stimulated. 
1. Dip a finger in cold or hot water; then the whole hand. 
Which gives the more intense sensation, the finger or the hand? 
2. Procure several boxes of different sizes. Load them with 
shot until they all have the same weight. Do not let the subject 
see or handle the boxes. Place them one after another on the palm 
of the subject’s hand. What is the relation between the apparent 
weight and size? 
B. Physiological diffusion. Compare the apparent size of the 
small white square on the black background with that of the small 
black square on the white background (Chart 33, opposite page 92). 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  188 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
A black surface absorbs nearly all the rays of light that fall 
upon it, reflecting very few rays to the retina. A white surface, 
on the other hand, reflects nearly all the rays falling upon it. 
The portions of the retina corresponding to the black surfaces 
in the figures are receiving relatively little stimulation, whereas 
adjacent areas of the retina are receiving a large amount of 
stimulation. The rays of light irradiate or spread into the non- 
stimulated areas and the physiological processes in the retina 
also tend to spread into adjoining areas. The small white 
square appears larger than a black square of the same size. 
The cause of this illusion is partly a physical irradiation of 
the rays of light and partly a physiological diffusion of the 
processes in the retina. 
C. The physiological zero point of temperature. 
1. Touch with your finger or hand (a) a piece of wood, (6) cloth, 
(c) metal, all being of the temperature of the room. Note the 
resulting sensations of temperature. 
2. Take three vessels containing water: one at 20° C. (68° F.), 
the second at 30° C. (86° F.), and the third at 40° C. (104° F.). 
Put the forefinger of one hand into the warmest water, that of the 
other hand into the coldest. After one minute place both fingers in 
the water of medium temperature. Do the fingers give different 
temperature sensations ? 
3. Hold the hand for one minute in water of 10° C. (50° F.) and 
then transfer it to water of 20° C. (68° F.). Do you observe that 
the latter feels warm at first, but after a time cold? 
The quality and intensity of a temperature sensation, excited 
by an object in contact with the skin, depend upon the relative 
conductivity of its substance, t.e., the rate at which it absorbs 
heat from the body or radiates heat to the body, and upon its 
temperature relative to the temperature of the part of the 
body affected. The degree of temperature that excites no 
sensation of either heat or cold is called the physiological zero
-P-A-G-E-227
PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 189 
point. Under usual conditions it is the normal temperature of 
the body. 
D. The rate of application of the stimulus. Place a vessel 
filled with water over a Bunsen burner or spirit lamp. Plunge the 
hand into the water and allow it to remain in the water without 
movement. Let the water be heated gradually. Can the temper- 
ature of the water be considerably increased without your observing 
a heat sensation ? 
To produce a physiological excitation, all stimuli must be 
applied with some abruptness or suddenness. A frog placed in 
a vessel of water over a slowly augmenting source of heat can 
be boiled in the course of a few hours without making any sign 
of discomfort. 
E. Contrast of stimuli at the point of application. Dip the 
hand up to the wrist in water of the temperature of the room. 
Hold in place for a number of seconds. Do you feel the pressure 
equally distributed over the hand or only a ring of pressure about 
the wrist ? Thrust the arm slowly into the water. Where do you 
feel the sensation of pressure chiefly ? 
The physiological processes of the body are gradually accom- 
modated to a stimulus, e.g., the pressure of the water, and then 
cease to respond to constant stimulation. 
F. The sensitivity of moving parts of the body. 
1. Place a hair on a plate of glass or other hard, smooth sur- 
face, and over it lay ten or more sheets of ordinary writing paper. 
How many sheets of paper can you place over the hair and still 
detect it by passing the finger-tips back and forth over it? Can 
you feel the hair under the finger when resting the finger upon it 
without movement, either with or without the intervening paper ? 
2. Rest the finger-tip lightly upon a rough-covered book and
-P-A-G-E-228
190 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
then move the finger over its surface. What difference in sen- 
sation do you notice? Close the eyes and touch the finger-tip 
successively to a rough-covered book and a smooth one. Can you 
distinguish between the two? Can you distinguish the difference 
as soon as the finger-tip is moved over the two surfaces? The 
relative sensitivity of active and passive touch can be exactly 
determined by using different grades of sandpaper. 
Experiment XLII. The production of sensations of specific quality 
by general stimuli — the specific energy of sense organs and nerve fibres. 
1. Rub with a menthol pencil the skin of the back of the hand. 
Tap the mentholized area and adjacent portions of the skin; wave 
the hand about; touch the mentholized area with a cold object, 
with a hot object. What are the resulting sensations ? 
2. Locate an isolated cold spot and tap the spot with a fine 
wooden point. Touch the cold spot with a slightly heated needle 
point that feels warm when applied to adjacent spots. Observe 
the resulting sensations. In making these experiments try, for 
comparison, adjacent points on the skin. 
A blow upon the ear will give rise to a sensation of sound: 
If the eye is struck, one may see stars. Steady pressure on 
the eyeball will cause a brilliant display of colored figures. 
When the optic nerve is cut, a sudden flash of light is seen. 
The application of menthol increases the sensitivity of the 
nerves to cold. It is maintained that a cold spot, when 
touched or pricked, will give rise to a sensation of cold only. 
When the back of the tongue is pressed, a bitter taste, 
sometimes a sour taste, is excited. It is claimed that a 
current of air applied to certain localities of the tongue 
gives rise to a salt taste. Some have reported a sweet taste 
from the use of cold water as a gargle. A current of elec- 
tricity applied to the tongue excites a sour taste; applied to 
the optic or auditory nerve, retinal and auditory sensations
-P-A-G-E-229
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 191 
respectively; applied to the olfactory region of the nose, 
sensations of smell. 
Such forms of energy as mechanical impacts, chemical irrita- 
tion, heat, and the electric current appear to be capable of stimu- 
lating all the nerves of the body. When a sensory nerve is thus 
stimulated by any one of these forms of energy, the sensation 
that results is one appropriate to the particular nerve affected, 
and not to the particular stimulus employed; for example, it is 
a flash of light whether the optic nerve be stimulated by pres- 
sure, by section, or by an electric current. Those stimuli which 
may excite any nerve are distinguished, as general or inade- 
quate stimuli, from the specific or adequate stimulus, to which 
a particular nerve and sense organ respond normally and 
most readily with their specific sensation: —e.g., atmospheric 
vibrations for the ear and auditory nerve, light for the eye and 
optic nerve, heat for the nerves of heat and cold, mechanical 
impact for touch, chemical action for taste and smell. The 
fact that a sense organ and nerve, when excited by a general 
stimulus, respond with the same sensation that results from 
the specific stimulus suggests that the specific or distinctive 
quality of a sensation depends upon the “native” function of 
the nerve fibres and sense organs, and that the external stimuli 
are indifferent. ‘We feel our nerves,” so this fact of sensa- 
tion has been stated, «and not the external stimuli.” The 
theory of specific energy, which maintains that the physiological 
processes of a sensory system, composed of nerve cells and 
fibres and sense organs, alone™determine the quality of a sen- 
sation, probably exaggerates the indifference of the external 
stimuli. Nevertheless it calls attention to the important fact 
that our sensations are not always comparable to the external 
stimuli. Thus the sensation of white is a simple, unmixed 
sensation, but white light, its stimulus, is a mixture of many 
different rays of light; the difference between the sensation of 
red and the sensation of blue is a qualitative difference, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  192 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
’ difference in kind of sensation, although the respective stimuli, 
ved and blue light, are both ether waves, differing only in 
vibration frequency and wave length. 
Is the specific physiological process located more particularly 
in the sense organ, in the nerve fibre, or in the nerve cells of 
the brain center? At first the nerve fibre was selected as the 
seat of the specific sensory energy. The most striking struc- 
tures of the eye and ear have nothing to do with the sensory 
process of seeing and hearing; the organs are for the most 
part mechanical structures whose function is to bring the 
external stimulus to act upon the. true sensory structures. 
The rods and cones are the sensory cells of the organ of vision 
(see Diagram III, page 36), and the inner and outer hair cells 
on the basilar membrane of the cochlea are similar structures 
of the organ of audition (see Diagram XXXII, page 171). The 
function of the sensory cells is to excite the ends of nerve fibres 
terminating near them, when they have been acted-upon by 
the external stimulus. But the nerve fibre may be excited 
directly by a physical stimulus without the mediate action 
of the sensory cells, as is common with the nerves of touch, 
which terminate freely near the surface of the skin (see 
Diagram XXIV, page 163). Reference to the diagrams will 
show the nerve fibres to be the processes of nerve cells situated 
between the sensory cells and the brain or spinal cord. The 
nerve cells from which proceed the fibres of the nerve of smell 
appear to be located in the olfactory membrane of the nose, 
close to the surface where they can be directly acted upon by 
the external stimulus. The elliptical cell of Diagram XXXVII, 
having a narrow upward prolongation and terminal hair-like 
processes, is an olfactory cell situated between the structural 
cells of the membrane. It is probably a nerve cell, for the 
nerve fibre seems to run direct from it to the brain. The 
sense apparatus of smell is least developed, from the anatomical 
point of view. The sensory cells of the retina are the most
-P-A-G-E-231
  PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 193 
highly developed. The sensory cells of the ear, and of touch 
and taste, are intermediate in degree of specialization (see Dia 
grams, pages 164, 166, and 171). But in all cases the func- 
tion of the sensory cells, where such exist, is the stimulation 
of nerve cells and fibres connecting the sensory cells with the 
brain and spinal cord, and through 
other interposed cells ultimately with 
the specialized nerve cells in the cortex 
of the cerebral hemispheres. The direct 
stimulation of the nerve cells of the 
brain may also cause subjective sensa- 
tions, the quality of the sensations 
depending upon the portion of the brain 
affected. A mechanical irritation, — 
for example, a piece of bone pressing 
against the brain substance, drugs that 
irritate the cells of the brain, and even 
abnormal variations in the blood supply, pyxgram XXXVI Anolfac- 
—may excite hallucinations of sight, tory cell and nerve fibre. 
  hearing, taste, smell, touch, temper- 
ature, and pain. The vivid perceptions and sensations present 
during dreams also show that a central stimulation of the 
nervous substance of the brain may excite sensations which 
are oftentimes not distinguishable in quality from those 
received through the external stimulation of the sense organs. 
But this power of the brain to give rise to sensations when 
directly stimulated is developed only when the sense organs 
have been intact and have responded for a period of time to 
external stimuli. The loss of the sense organ of vision before 
the fifth year of life deprives an individual of all the visual 
elements of consciousness, though if the loss occurs after this 
period he may retain the power to have visual dreams and 
visual images of fancy. The specific character of a sensation 
is determined not by any one part of the physiological process, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  194 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
nor even by the entire physiological process alone, but by this 
and the external stimulus together; in the later life of an 
individual, one part of the physiological process, the brain cells, 
may acquire the power to respond with specific sensations to 
general stimuli. But the sensations and perceptions which 
are excited by electrical and other general stimuli are by no 
means so complex and various as are those excited in the 
normal way by the specific external stimulus. An intelligible 
explanation of the existence in our minds of different sensa- 
tions must direct itself to an examination of (1) the inter- 
relations of the mental contents as such; (2) their relation 
to the particular structures and functions of the body; and 
(8) their dependence upon the specific stimuli of the physical 
environment,

CHAPTER VI 
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 
Exrrriment XLIII. Qualitative analysis of sensations of sound. 
A. Noise. Procure eight wooden sticks such as are used in a 
xylophone or make them by cutting eight sticks of different lengths 
from a strip of wood about one inch wide and a quarter of an inch 
thick. Drop one of these sticks upon a table having a hard surface. 
Is the sound sensation a noise or a tone? Drop the eight sticks 
in succession. Is the tone quality then readily distinguished ? 
If resonators are to be had, employ these to hear the component 
tones of the noises you may hear about you, such as that made by 
scraping the foot over the bare floor. A resonator is a hollow 
chamber of such size that the enclosed air is thrown into sympa- 
thetic vibration by a sound wave of only one vibration frequency 
and not by others. Without the aid of resonators, if you have 
a good ear, you may still be able to hear the tones contained in 
many noises. 
B. Composite tones or clangs — timbre. 
1. Strike a note on some musical instrument, for example a 
violin, guitar, or xylophone. Can you detect a fundamental tone 
and several overtones in the resulting sound sensation ? 
2. Cause a string to vibrate and give a musical tone. Shorten the 
string by one-half. What is the musical relation of the pitch or 
quality of the tone of the half string to that of the whole string ? 
3. Cause a third of the string to vibrate; a fourth; a fifth. 
What is the musical relation of each of these tones to that of 
the whole string ? 
4, When the whole string is sounding loudly can you detect 
any or all of the tones that corresponded to the half, the third, the 
fourth, and the fifth of the string ? 
195 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
  196 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
5. Strike the same note on a number of instruments. What is 
the difference between these tones of like pitch? Is timbre a differ- 
ence in the quality of sensation or is it due to the combination 
of a number of tone sensations ? 
The string of a musical instrument vibrates at a certain 
constant rate. The tone sensation corresponding to the vibration 
rate of the whole string is its fundamental tone. The string, 
however, may vibrate also in aliquot parts; thus each half of 
the string may vibrate twice as rapidly as the whole string; each 
third at three times the rate of the whole string, each fourth at 
four times the rate, etc. The tone sensations produced by 
these vibrations of the aliquot parts of the string are called its 
overtones. Every musical instrument produces a composite of 
tones, called a clang sensation; the quality or pitch of the clang 
is given by its emphatic elementary tone —its fundamental. 
With this may be heard overtones having the pitch of tones 
of a vibration rate twice, three, four, five, etc., times that of the 
fundamental. If the fundamental can be represented in musi- 
cal notation by C, the first overtone is C of the first octave 
above the fundamental; the second is G of this octave; the 
third, fourth, and fifth overtones are C, F, and G of the second 
octave, etc. Every musical tone is in reality a clang that can 
be analyzed psychically into a simultaneous group of tone sensa- 
tions, and for each of the component tone sensations there is a 
stimulus represented by the vibration of the parts of a string, a 
column of air or other sounding body. The timbre, or so-called 
quality, of musical instruments and the human voice is depend- 
ent upon the relative number and intensity of the component 
overtones. 
C. Beats and roughness of clangs. Allow two tuning forks of 
the same pitch to vibrate together. You will get a tone as though 
coming from a single fork of greater amplitude (intensity) of 
vibration. Weight the prong of one fork with wax and allow the
-P-A-G-E-235
  PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 197 
forks to vibrate together. Observe the very disagreeable beats. 
Repeat this procedure a number of times, increasing gradually the 
amount of wax. Do the beats increase in frequency? By adding 
wax can you cause them to pass into an indistinguishable roughness 
and finally to disappear ? 
Beats are due to an interference of atmospheric vibrations in 
opposite phase of wave motion. Two waves of water coming 
together so that their crests coincide will produce a wave 
higher than either. Coming together so that the crest of the 
one and the trough of the other coincide, they will interfere and 
perhaps obliterate the wave motion. Forks vibrating at the 
rate of 100 and 101 vibrations per second, respectively, will 
once in the second have alternately augmented and interfering 
wave crests. This alternate rise and fall in the intensity of 
the sound waves is the physical stimulus of the beat. If the 
forks differ by two vibrations there will be two beats per 
second. About forty beats per second is the limit of distin- 
guishability for even acute ears. At this limit the beats give 
rise to a sensation of roughness. As the difference in the vibra- 
tion rate of the two forks increases, the roughness gradually 
diminishes and finally disappears ; a difference tone having a 
pitch corresponding to the vibration difference may be heard 
combined with the fundamentals and overtones of the two forks. 
D. The inter-relations of the component tones of clangs. 
1. Sound together a note and the second above, a note and its 
third, a note and its fourth, a note and its fifth; for example, 
C and D, C and E, C and F, © and G. Which pair gives the 
most pleasing combination ? 
2. Sound the notes of each pair in succession. Which pair gives 
the most pleasing sequence ? 
8. Combine a great number of tones as by striking many keys of 
the piano at once. Is the resultant sensation a noise? Is it 
displeasing? Why? 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  198 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
The most accordant combination of clangs is composed of a 
note and the first octave above. The combination of a note 
and its fifth, e.g., C and G, is more pleasing than that of a note 
and its second, C and D. The reason for this appears from 
the accompanying table of the overtones of C, D, E, F, and G

and of c of the octave above, when these tones are in com- 
bination with C. The vibrations of C and c respectively are 
in the ratio of 1: 2. No matter what the actual vibrations may 
be, the first eight overtones of C can be represented by 2, 38, 4, 
5, 6, T, 8, and 9, and the first eight overtones of ¢ by 4, 6, 8, 10, 
12, 16, and 18; to get the vibration rates of the overtones, we 
multiply the vibration rates of the fundamentals by 2, 3, 4, ete. 
Those overtones in the series of the first eight overtones which 
are common to both C and c are heavy-faced in the table. 
Every overtone of ¢ is an overtone of C, and the fundamental
-P-A-G-E-237
  PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 199 
of c is the first overtone of C. The composite clang C + ¢ con- 
tains no elementary tones which are not actually present in the 
simple clang C. When a note and its second are sounded 
together, C + D, the vibration frequencies of the two tones are 
in the ratio of 8:9. An inspection of the table giving the 
overtones of these two notes will show that the eighth overtone 
of C and the seventh of D are the first overtones common to 
both notes. The combined clang C+D is composed of many 
dissimilar elements, whereas the combined clang C + ¢ is con- 
stituted of similar elements. The combination of a note and its 
fifth, C + G, contains component fundamental tones the vibra- 
tion rates of which are in the ratio of 2:3. Within the first 
eight overtones, these notes have three overtones in common, 
the second, fifth, and eighth overtones of C and the first, third, 
and fifth of G. The combination C + E has only one common 
overtone within the first eight, the fourth of C and the third 
of E. The combination C+F has two common overtones 
within this range, the third and seventh of C and the second 
and fifth of F. Arranged in the order of similarity of com- 
ponents, these clangs fall into the following sequence: (1) C+e; 
(2) C+G; (8) C+F; (4) C+E; (5) C+D. The higher the 
order of an overtone, the less is its intensity. The common over- 
tones of C + D, being in the seventh and eighth order respect- 
ively, are so weak as to be practically negligible. Moreover two 
overtones may give beats if their vibration rates are close enough 
together. C+D contains overtones that would give rise to 
beats; these give to the combination a characteristic roughness 
and unpleasantness. 
The aesthetic value of clang combinations — ‘.e., harmony — 
is largely dependent upon the absence of beats and roughness 
and the relative intensity of common overtones. The simi- 
larity of the components of clang combinations must not be so 
great as to constitute practical identity, if the combination is 
to produce a pleasing effect. The combination C+ ce is not 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  200 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
so pleasing as the combination C +G, because of the practi- 
cal identity of c with C. The same principles underlie the 
aesthetic effect of tones in sequence. The succession of tones 
in a melody is determined also by the relative degree of similarity 
and variety in the clang components. Noises are clang combi- 
nations containing relatively the largest number of unlike over- 
tones along with fundamentals and overtones producing beats 
and roughness. It is contended by some psychologists, however, 
that after all the tones have been separated from a noise a 
specific “noise ” sensation remains. These psychologists recog- 
nize two classes of simple, ¢.e., unanalyzable, sensations of sound 
— tones and noises. 
The simple tone sensation is an abstraction of analysis, all 
external musical tones being composed of a fundamental and 
overtones. A simple tone sensation would be received from 
an atmospheric vibration of a single constant rate. Tuning- 
forks have been constructed to give approximately simple tone 
sensations. The siren, also, is a source of vibrations relatively 
free from overtones. But even when the external vibrations 
are of one frequency only, the organ of hearing itself may 
contribute the overtones. 
Exrrriment XLIV. The quality and intensity thresholds of sen- 
sations of sound. 
A. The initial intensity threshold. Let the subject be seated 
in a quiet room, and keep the eyes closed and head steady. Hold 
a watch close enough to his right ear to be distinctly audible. 
Move it slowly away from the ear, along a line perpendicular to 
the median vertical plane of the head, until the subject announces 
that he is unable any longer to hear the ticking. Measure the 
distance. This is the “just unnoticeable” distance. 
Begin with the watch at a distance from the right ear some- 
what greater than the just unnoticeable distance, and move the
-P-A-G-E-239
  PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 201 
watch slowly in toward the ear until the subject announces that 
he is just able to hear the ticking. This is the “just noticeable” 
distance. 
Repeat these two experiments four times each and get the 
“average just noticeable” and the “average just unnoticeable” 
distances. Add these together and divide by two to get the 
“initial intensity threshold” of the sound of the ticking watch. 
Obtain in the same way the initial threshold for the left ear. 
The two thresholds make possible an estimation of the relative 
sensibility of the two ears. 
B. The initial and final quality threshold. 
1. Use for the purpose of this experiment a siren connected 
with bellows. As the disc of the siren begins to rotate, separate 
puffs of air will be heard escaping through the holes of the dise. 
The number of puffs per second increase with the rate of rotation 
of the disc. When they have a frequency of about thirty or forty 
per second, they will no longer be heard as separate puffs of air 
but will give rise to the sensation of a tone of low pitch. The 
siren is provided with a dial upon which a moving hand records 
the number of rotatibns of the disc per second; from this can 
easily be calculated the number of interrupted puffs which give 
rise to the tone of lowest noticeable pitch, é.¢., the initial quality 
threshold. 
The final or upper threshold of sound quality may be obtained 
by using a Galton’s whistle. The high shrill note is gradually 
increased in pitch by screwing down the plunger of the whistle 
until a tone sensation no longer results from the rapid vibrations 
of the escaping air. Steel bars or tubes marked with their respec- 
tive vibration rates may also be employed. 
The atmospheric waves, radiating from a sounding object, 
preserve their form and vibration frequency, but diminish in 
amplitude as the distance from the source of sound increases. 
The quality of the tone sensation depends upon the vibration 
frequency; the intensity upon the amplitude of the vibration. 
For this reason, the greatest distance at which the sounding
-P-A-G-E-240
ail a aia A a i a a 
202 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
body is capable of giving rise to a sensation of sound can be 
taken to measure the least intensity of a stimulus sufficient to 
give rise to a sensation. Above this initial threshold value 
of the stimulus, the vibration amplitude may be indefinitely 
increased. The final threshold of sound intensity cannot be 
determined, because a stimulus of great intensity will cause the 
destruction of the tympanum. 
ExpERIMENT XLY. The intensity threshold of sensations of single 
quality.   A. The initial threshold of touch. Use Scripture’s touch weights 
to determine the smallest possible weight, measured in milligrams, 
that will give rise to a sensation of touch. Beginning with the 
smallest weight, apply them successively in order of weight to the 
palm of the hand or other portion of the subject’s body. Screen 
from the subject’s view the part to which the stimulus is applied. 
The twenty circles of cardboard one centimetre in diameter vary 
from one to twenty milligrams in weight. The initial threshold 
of touch sensation is expressed in terms of the impact exerted by 
the weight giving rise to the just noticeable sensation. 
B. The initial threshold of taste qualities. Prepare two solu- 
tions respectively of salt and sugar by dissolving ten grams of each 
in one hundred grams of distilled water. Measure off a small 
quantity of one solution, say a gram. Is the characteristic taste 
quality recognizable on sipping? If so, add a gram of water to 
a gram of the solution. Stir thoroughly and taste as before. 
If the taste can still be recognized, add another gram of water 
to a gram of the last solution and continue until you are no longer 
able to detect the taste of the liquid. Compare the percentage of 
sugar and salt respectively in the solutions which first give no sen- 
sation of taste. The thresholds for bitter and sour may be measured 
in terms of solutions of quinine and tartaric acid. 
C. The final threshold of pressure sensation. Take the pressure 
algometer and press with considerable force upon the ball of the 
thumb of the right hand. Ask the subject if he feels a sensation 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 203 
of pain only or if the pain is combined with pressure. If a pres- 
sure stimulus can give a pain sensation of such intensity that the 
pressure sensation is suppressed by the stronger pain sensation, 
we are then above the final threshold of the pressure sensation. 
In such case the pressure may be taken below this final limit 
and increased until the subject announces that he just begins to 
experience pain alone. Five trials should be made and an average 
measurement obtained in kilograms. This value measures the final 
threshold of pressure sensibility. 
The initial threshold of these sensations is both a qualitative 
and an intensive threshold. Sound sensations alone have two 
distinguishably different thresholds, one of quality and one of 
intensity ; retinal sensations have but a single threshold, that 
of quality. 
EXPERIMENT XLVI. The discrimination of small differences in the 
quality of sensation; the difference threshold. 
Take two tuning-forks of exactly the same number of vibrations 
per second, and hence giving tone sensations of the same quality 
or pitch. Strike them in succession, allowing each to vibrate for 
about a second with a second’s interval between. Stick a small 
quantity of beeswax on the end of a prong of one fork and cause 
the forks to vibrate in succession as before, striking the weighted 
fork last. Inquire of the subject whether the two forks appear to 
differ in tone and if so which of the two is the higher. If the 
subject reports that the forks seem to be of the same pitch, add 
more wax to the weighted fork. Continue until the subject is 
quite sure that he observes a difference in pitch between the two 
forks. Determine the objective difference in the vibration rate by 
allowing the two forks to vibrate together and thus give rise to 
beats. The number of beats per second is equal to the difference in 
the number of vibrations per second. This is the “ just noticeable 
amount of difference.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  204 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
Now increase the difference between the two forks by using a 
considerable amount of wax. Sound as before, and the subject will 
notice clearly and distinctly the difference in pitch. Diminish the 
amount of wax until the subject says the two forks seem to have 
the same pitch. Measure the difference in vibration rate. This is 
the “just unnoticeable amount of difference.” 
Repeat each of these experiments until you get five measure- 
ments of the just unnoticeable difference and five of the just 
noticeable difference. Average each set of results. Add the aver- 
age results and divide by two. The final result is a difference 
threshold of tone quality. 
Experiment XLVII. The discrimination of small differences in 
the intensity of stimuli; the psycho-physical methods; the psycho- 
physical or Weber’s law. 
A. The method of minimal gradation, also called the method of 
just noticeable amount of difference. 
1. Let a subject hold in his hand a wide-mouthed bottle of not 
very thick glass partly filled with sand so as to be of some con- 
venient weight, e.g., a hundred grams. Let the subject close his 
eyes. Pour gently a constant stream of sand into the bottle thus 
held by the subject. Have the subject call out, “Now,” as soon as 
he notices a change in the weight of the bottle. Weigh the bottle 
with its increase of sand and subtract from this the weight of the 
bottle and its contents at the beginning of the experiment. This 
difference in weight is the just noticeable difference of intensity. 
It is called the “upper” difference threshold of intensity. 
Place in the hand of the subject a bottle of the same weight as 
before. Let the subject having his eyes closed tilt the bottle, 
pouring the sand slowly from the bottle until he notices a differ- 
ence in weight. Calculate the difference between this and the origi- 
nal weight. Obtain the average result of five experiments. This 
value measures the “lower” difference threshold of intensity. 
2. The customary procedure in accordance with this method 
gives the subject a standard stimulus to which he can refer the
-P-A-G-E-243
  PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 205 
changing comparison stimulus. Place two bottles partly filled with 
sand and of equal weight, one in each hand of the subject. Increase 
as before the weight of the bottle in the right hand until the subject 
is just able to notice a difference. Record the objective difference 
in weight as the just noticeable amount of difference. Take the 
comparison weight considerably heavier than the standard weight, 
and proceed to obtain the just unnoticeable amount of difference. 
Make ten experiments and get the average upper difference thresh- 
old. Obtain by a similar procedure the average lower difference 
threshold. Add the upper and lower values and divide by two. 
The resultant value is the just noticeable difference threshold. 
3. Require the subject to lift both weights with the same hand, 
preferably the right. The comparison weight must then be succes- 
sively increased or decreased by small amounts. In giving his 
judgment of the relative weight of the stimuli, the subject lifts one 
weight after the other with a single movement of the hand and arm 
lasting about one second and allowing a second’s interval between 
the lifting of the first and second weights. The standard weight 
should be lifted first in one half of the trials and second in the 
other half. This procedure should be followed in conducting 
experiments by all of the psycho-physical methods. The standard 
stimulus should be compared with each weight of the comparison 
stimulus only once, an immediate judgment being insisted upon 
after each trial. 
With the method of just noticeable difference, the just unnotice- 
able upper and lower thresholds are determined by the procedure 
described in Experiment XLVI, and are combined with the just 
noticeable thresholds. The upper and lower thresholds of difference 
should be calculated separately and afterward combined to obtain 
the average threshold of difference. 
B. The method of unnoticeable difference, or method of average 
error. Take a standard weight, e.g., 100 grams, and a comparison 
weight considerably above or below it. Let the subject make the 
comparison weight equal to the standard weight, lifting the’ weights 
successively with one hand. When the subject reports that the two 
weights seem to him alike, weigh the comparison weight exactly in 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
= ee: 
206 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
the balance and then calculate the amount of error. Make five 
experiments beginning with the comparison weight lighter than the 
standard and five with the comparison weight heavier. Average 
the two sets of five results separately. You will thus have two 
average errors which may differ slightly, depending upon the direc- 
tion of change in the comparison weight. Calculate the average 
variation of each error from the average error. The average error 
records the constant tendency toward an over- or under-estimation ; 
the average variation, also called the average variable error, records 
the constancy with which the subject approximates to the standard 
weight. The constant error and the variable error are dependent 
upon different causes. 
C. The method of right and wrong cases. Take weights of 100, 
101, 104, and 112 grams of the same size and external appearance. 
Require the subject to lift two weights in succession, giving one 
second’s stimulation and one second’s interval. Let one of the 
two weights be always the standard weight of 100 grams. Make 
thirty experiments, é.e., ten with each of the comparison weights. 
With each pair of weights, for example with 100 and 104 grams, 
let the subject lift the heavier weight first in five of the ten trials 
and last in the other five trials. Require the subject always to 
judge, even though it be the merest guess, which of the two weights 
presented him in pairs is the heavier. Record his judgment as right 
or wrong as the case may be. For each comparison weight, ascer- 
tain the percentage of times the subject is right in his judgment. 
Does the correctness of judgment increase from a mere guess to 
certainty as the comparison weight increases? Do you consider the 
threshold to be the amount of difference required to give 50 per 
cent, 75 per cent, or 100 per cent right cases? 
This experiment can hardly give satisfactory results with less 
than one hundred experiments with each pair of weights. 
D. The method of the estimated amount of difference, also called 
the method of supraliminal difference. Take two standard weights 
of 100 and 112 grams. Give the subject a third box nearly equal 
in weight to one of these and require him to add to or subtract from 
the weight of this box until its weight seems midway between that 
of the other two. Make five trials and get an average result and
-P-A-G-E-245
  PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 207 
an average variation. Is the average result the arithmetical or 
geometrical mean of the two standard weights? 
Take two boxes, one filled with sand weighing 100 grams, the 
other empty. Require the subject to fill the second with sand so 
as to weigh twice as much as the first box. Make five trials and 
obtain the average result and average variation. Repeat for one- 
half, three times, and five times the weight of the standard stimulus. 
E. The increase of the difference threshold in proportion to the 
increase of the intensity of the stimulus. 
Repeat the experiments, employing one or all of the methods, 
using standard weights of 50 and 200 grams. 
Compare the respective results with weights of 50, 100, and 200 
grams. Is the threshold of difference constant for all intensities of 
the standard stimulus or does it increase in the same proportion as 
the intensity of the stimuli? 
Suppose the intensities of two similar stimuli to have a value 
of 100. These stimuli may be two weights of 100 grams or 
two sound waves originated by a ball dropping upon a plate 
from a height of 100 inches, etc. If the intensity of one of a 
pair of equal stimuli is successively increased by very small 
amounts, ¢.g., by one, two, three grams, etc., a difference between 
the greater stimulus and the stimulus of 100 will not be observed 
at once. Let us suppose that when the greater stimulus is 
made equal to 120, a subject is just able to distinguish the 
greater stimulus from the smaller. Let us suppose further that 
when the intensity of a stimulus has a value of 50, the sub- 
ject can distinguish equally well between it and a stimulus of 
only 60. When we give the stimulus a value of 200 and take 
as a comparison stimulus one of 220, the subject will fail to 
notice that they are different: In this region of the scale 
of stimuli intensities, the difference must be made equal to 40, 
in order that he may perceive them to be different. We have 
now assumed that the stimulus of 50 must be increased by 10, 
the stimulus of 100 by 20, and the stimulus of 200 by 40, in
-P-A-G-E-246
  208 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
order that each stimulus be distinguished respectively from 
another that is greater by the least perceivable amount. If 
experimentation with various stimuli gave nearly similar results, 
we could express the general result in the form of a law that 
the least amount of perceivable difference is a constant proportion 
of the intensity of the stimulus. In the case assumed the relative 
difference just noticeable is } of the stimulus. To the quantity 
100 must be added } of itself, or 20, to obtain two stimuli dis- 
tinguishably different. To the stimulus 120, 1, or 24, must be 
added; to 144, 28.8 must be added. A series of values, 20, 24, 
28.8, 34.6, etc., will be developed by this procedure; each num- 
ber of the series measures a just noticeable amount of difference 
in the ascending scale of stimuli. If we represent graphically, 
as in Diagram XXXVIII, the quantity 20 by a line } inch in

DracramM XXXVIII. The just noticeable increment of the stimulus repre- 
sented graphically by proportional lengths of a straight line. 
length, the increment 24 will be represented by a line propor- 
tionately longer; the increments 28.8 and 34.6 by increasingly 
greater lengths of line. The line represented above is divided 
into four parts that have the proportions necessary to give a 
graphic representation of these progressive increases in the 
magnitude of the increment. 
Let us designate by the letter S the sensation to which the 
stimulus 100 gives rise and by S%, S®, S4, and S®, respectively, 
the sensations due to the stimuli 120, 144, 172.8, and 207.4, 
which are obtained by adding the increasing increments. These 
five sensations will constitute a series of increasing intensities. 
This fact of sensation may be represented, as in Diagram XXXIX, 
by a continuous curved line along which will fall at different 
points the sensations S, S?, S%, S#, 85 Let a point on the hori- 
zontal line of this diagram be taken to stand for the position

of the stimulus 100. If, as before, the just noticeable incre- 
ment 20 be represented by a length of 4 inch, and we measure 
a stretch of this length to the right, we fix on the line the posi- 
tion of the just noticeably greater stimulus 120. Continuing

this procedure, we place upon the line, 144, 172.8, 207.4, at dis- 
tances determined by the just noticeable increments. From the 
point of the horizontal line which represents the stimulus 100 
we may erect a vertical line to represent the sensation §, cor- 
responding to the stimulus. The intensity of § is unknown. 
There are no mental units of measurement similar to grams and 
inches in terms of which to express the intensity of the sensa- 
tion relative to that of the stimulus. But the sensation has 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
210 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
some intensity, and, whatever this may be, a line of an arbitrary 
length, say + of an inch, may be taken to represent it. From 
the point 100 of the horizontal we then measure off a vertical 
line 4 of an inch in length. This will not mean that the 
intensity of the sensation is 4 that of the stimulus, but only 
that the sensation has some as yet unknown value. From the 
upper end of the vertical line an oblique line (the line of dashes 
in the diagram) drawn to the right would contain a continuous 
series of increasing sensations; the increasing distance of this 
oblique line from the horizontal line of stimuli would express 
the fact that sensations increase as their stimuli increase. 
If it were a fact that sensations increased by the same amount 
as do the stimuli, the line of increasing sensations would have 
the direction of the line of dashes in the figure. The length of 
the vertical line S?, included between the horizontal and oblique 
lines, is equal to the length of the line of S plus the length that 
was taken to represent the increase of stimulus 120 over 100. 
Verticals representing S?, S4, and S® will each be increased by 
the respective increments of their stimuli. Experimentation 
and common experience demonstrate that the increase of sensa- 
tion becomes relatively smaller as the stimulus becomes greater. 
A line to represent this fact of sensation will need to be so 
drawn as to bend toward the horizontal line the farther it 
extends to the right. The line of sensational increase will, 
therefore, be a curved line, say for the moment, the continuous 
curved line of the diagram. 
It has been supposed that the psycho-physical law enables us 
to determine the exact course of this curved line of sensation. 
It will be remembered that stimulus 120 is just noticeably 
greater than stimulus 100. It seems to follow from this fact 
that S? is also just noticeably greater than S. What the amount 
of this difference would be if we were able to measure the 
intensity of the sensations directly as we can measure the 
intensity of the stimuli, psychology is not able to say. But we
-P-A-G-E-249
  
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 211 
can say that there is at least some difference between S? and S, 
and we may represent this fact by drawing a heavy vertical line 
from the horizontal to S?, making it longer than S by some 
arbitrary amount. When we come to erect the vertical line of 
sensation for the stimulus 144, we are again in doubt as to 
what length of line to employ. As S* is the sensation received 
from a stimulus just noticeably greater than the stimulus of S?, 
we can also draw the sensation line of S? somewhat longer than 
the sensation line of S?, for example the heavy portion of the 
vertical line erected at the position 144 on the horizontal line. 
The exact length of vertical line necessary to represent the 
relative intensity of the sensation S* depends upon the actual 
difference of intensity assumed to exist between S%, S%, and 8. 
No one of these sensations can be measured by itself, nor can 
any two give a satisfactory measure. It has been assumed, 
however, that, inasmuch as the stimulus of S® is noticeably 
greater than the stimulus of S?, and the stimulus of S? is notice- 
ably greater than that of S, we may consider that the sensa- 
tion S® differs by the same amount from S? as the sensation S? 
differs from S; in consequence, S?— S?= S?—S, This would 
permit us to draw the sensation line of S? as much longer than 
S? as S? is longer than S. This is the length of the combined 
heavy and fine line from the horizontal to S*. As soon as 
we have determined the relative lengths of the three sensation 
lines for S, S?, and S%, we can draw a continuous line connect- 
ing the points ascertained and extend this to the right to rep- 
resent sensations of intensities which have not as yet been 
examined. On the assumption that sensations of all intensities 
are related to their stimuli, as are the three sensations S, S?, 
and S8, three points are sufficient to establish the line to be a 
curve and to determine exactly its entire course. The curve 
will cut the sensation lines of S* and S® at such points that 
S5—S4=S4—§8=§2—8. In other words, the sensations increase 
by constant quantities when the stimuli increase by constant  
-P-A-G-E-250
  212 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
proportional amounts of the stimulus. If this interpretation of 
the facts of these experiments is a correct one, we may change 
the expression of the psycho-physical law to one of the two fol- 
lowing forms: Jf the sensations are to be increased by a constant 
amount, the stimulus must be increased by a constant ratio, or 
Sensations increase in an arithmetical series of progression when 
the stimuli increase in a geometrical one. 
Two series of quantities so related to one another that the 
one series varies arithmetically when the other varies geometric- 
ally are in the logarithmic relation. If any one quantity of 
either series is known, its corresponding quantity in the other 
series may be calculated. It appears to follow from the mathe- 
matical formula of logarithms that the intensity of a sensation 
is measurable in terms of the logarithm of the intensity of its 
stimulus. This form of the psycho-physical law, which may be 
called Fechner’s law, involves the further assumption that the 
constant just noticeable difference between any two sensations 
is equal to the first just noticeable sensation. The unit of pro- 
gression in the arithmetical series of sensations is therefore 
the just noticeable sensation, which repeats itself by addition, 
appearing throughout the series of intensities as the just 
noticeable amount of difference. If the letter C designates the 
constant multiplier required by the mathematical formula and 
varying for each group of stimuli, S the intensity of the sensa- 
tion, and s the intensity of the stimulus, Fechner’s law may be 
expressed thus: S=C log-s. Through this formula one may 
apparently measure sensation in terms of the stimulus, even 
though the sensation itself cannot be directly measured. 
Are we justified in thus interpreting the facts of psycho- 
physical experimentation? Is the just noticeable amount of 
difference a constant quantity of sensation successively added 
to the sensations in a series of increasing intensities? In 
psycho-physical experimentation, the subject is given two 
stimuli of different intensity. We get from him the judgment 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 213 
that they are alike or the judgment that they are unlike. 
Stimuli ranging from 100 to 119, inclusive, he tells us are’ 
exactly alike; in this he is wrong. The stimuli 100 and 120 
he informs us are different; in this he is right. It is an arbi- 
trary assumption of the psychologist that the only factor deter- 
mining the correctness of the judgment is the amount of 
difference between the intensities of the two sensations. Many 
processes are interpolated between the application of the stimuli 
and the announcement of a right judgment. There are the 
sense organs, the nerves and the brain on the physiological 
side; there is the factor of apperception, of preperception, of 
the associated mental contents which constitute the subject’s 
knowledge of the actual stimuli— all these contribute to form 
the resulting judgment. The facts of the experiment give the 
psychologist no knowledge of the various processes concerned, 
excepting only (1) the actual difference between the stimuli 
and (2) the rightness or wrongness of the subject’s judgment. 
What physiological and mental processes may have conspired 
to determine a right judgment in one case and a wrong judg- 
ment in another must be inferred from facts other than those 
obtained from the experiment. 
The methods employed to discover the relation of sensations 
to stimuli and to prove the psycho-physical law have all been 
illustrated in the simple experiments with the lifted weights 
above. The method of minimal gradation, by which one of two 
equal stimuli is changed until the two stimuli are just noticeably 
different, would seem at first sight the one best calculated to give 
direct results. The subject himself says when he notices a differ- 
ence. Criticism and practice alike demonstrate this method to 
be distinctly unsatisfactory. Subjects differ greatly as to the 
amount of difference they call “just noticeable.” These experi- 
ments serve to reveal the personal opinions of different subjects 
as to what the noticeable difference is, rather than to determine 
the actual difference of stimuli that is just noticeable,
-P-A-G-E-252
214 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
The method of estimated amount of difference also seems to 
deal directly with sensations. The subject is given two stimuli 
and is asked to produce a third stimulus that will give a sensa- 
tion midway between the two sensations of the given stimuli, 
for example to estimate the weight of three boxes, so that the 
sensation of weight received from one shall seem to him mid- 
way between the two others. This method also involves the 
subject’s opinion and knowledge. It is found in practice that 
the subject will choose a stimulus which, for some external 
reasons, he believes to be midway between the two other 
stimuli. Thus, in lifted weights, a weight of four pounds may 
be placed midway between one of two and one of six, the sub- 
ject endeavoring to calculate what a weight of four pounds 
feels like rather than to produce a weight that gives a sensa- 
tion standing midway between the sensations from two and six 
pounds respectively. The unreliability of this method is evi- 
dent when the subject is asked to produce a stimulus two, 
three, or four times as great as the one given him. This he 
can do fairly well in weights, because if he is givena weight of 
one pound, he tries to produce weights of two, three, and four 
pounds, but with other stimuli, such, for example, as sound, the 
judgments are exceedingly unsatisfactory. It is impossible to 
say whether one cup of coffee sweetened with sugar tastes two, 
three, or four times as sweet as another cup. 
The method of right and wrong cases is an important contri- 
bution of psychology to science. By this method, the subject 
can be kept entirely ignorant of the objective relation of the 
stimuli. He is given, for example, two weights and asked to 
decide which is the heavier. His judgment will be either right 
or wrong. This is recorded. In a hundred trials with stimuli 
differing by small amounts, he will be right a certain percent- 
age of times and wrong a certain percentage of times. If he 
is fifty times right and fifty times wrong, the result differs in 
no wise from chance. A coin tossed into the air is expected
-P-A-G-E-253
  
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS * 215 
to fall fifty times “heads up” and fifty times “tails up.” If 
the subject is right one hundred times in the one hundred trials, 
he has undoubtedly had something to go upon in distinguishing 
the stimuli. But if he is right 75 per cent of the times, there 
is also evidence, though not so certain, that the difference 
between the stimuli is sufficient to determine a judgment in the 
one direction rather than in the other. If a coin should fall 
heads up one hundred times, or even seventy-five times, in a 
hundred throws, we should infer that the coin or its thrower 
in some unknown manner determined the result. The percent- 
age of right judgments rises from 50 to 100 as the difference 
between two comparison stimuli is taken greater, and the 
evidence becomes stronger that the subject has had some dif- 
ference in sensation to go upon in forming his judgment of the 
difference between the stimuli. The amount of difference suf- 
ficient to give 75 per cent of right judgments is usually regarded 
as the just noticeable amount of difference. A smaller amount of 
difference will, however, be noticeable in a smaller percentage 
of cases and a larger amount of difference in a larger percentage 
of cases. 
The experiment, then, deals with two stimuli and with a 
mental reaction to the stimuli that is either a right or a wrong 
judgment. Upon what the judgment is based, the experiment 
itself does not disclose. It does tell us that similar reactions, 
namely a right judgment, will occur 75 per cent of the trials if 
the stimuli differ by a certain proportional amount. That the 
difference in the process of sensation is an important factor 
cannot be doubted, but this difference is not the only factor. 
Even if we eliminate such factors as the time and order of stimu- 
lation, the interval that elapses between the two stimuli pre- 
sented and the direct knowledge of the actual stimuli employed, 
we cannot exclude from participation in the determination of 
the mental result such factors as the physiological processes in 
sense organ, nerve, and brain and those mental processes which  
-P-A-G-E-254
216 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
we have described under the terms of “association,” “preper- 
ception,” and “apperception.” To assume that the sensations 
differ by a just noticeable amount because the stimuli differ by 
a just noticeable amount is to ignore all the factors that are 
concerned in the formation of a perception, excepting alone the 
intensity of the sensation. Even if we assume that the sensa- 
tion is the factor that contributes most largely to the mental 
result, we cannot be assured that the difference in sensation 
is entirely a difference of intensity. If every increase in the 
intensity of a stimulus caused the sensation to differ in quality, 
we might judge the intensities of the stimulus quite as well as 
if the sensation changed in intensity. We might even have 
formed the habit of calling changes in quality by the name 
“intensity”? because of the unavoidable tendency, several times 
discussed in the course of this Manual, to apply physical analo- 
gies to mental facts. This happens to be the case with tem- 
perature sensations. Because the physical stimulus of a heat 
sensation differs only in intensity from the stimulus of a cold 
sensation, many wrongly state that the two sensations differ 
also in intensity, and thus, if the analogy is carried out strictly, 
make the heat sensation an intense cold sensation, —a manifest 
absurdity. Heat and cold are two qualitatively different sensa- 
tions, arising from different degrees or intensities of the same 
form of energy, eg., heat. In the case of light also, we 
naturally think of the “quality” difference between red and 
a shade or tint of red as a difference of intensity, because 
we associate these differences with the physical intensity of 
illumination. 
The fact remains, however, that the subject does judge two 
stimuli to be just noticeably different when the amount of 
change is an approximately constant proportion of the inten- 
sity of the stimulus. This fact is one of no small importance 
and well deserves formulation as a psycho-physical law. The 
mental result of a stimulus is the perception of one external
-P-A-G-E-255
  
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL ANALYSIS 217 
object. The mental result of two stimuli differing by a certain 
amount is the perception of two just noticeably different objects. 
To obtain the same mental result from two other stimuli of greater 
absolute intensities, the amount of difference between the two 
stimuli must be increased in proportion to the increase in the 
absolute intensity of the stimuli. As stimuli increase, a greater 
amount of the stimulus will be required to produce the same 
mental reaction. The psycho-physical law is in effect a law of 
diminishing mental returns from increasing stimuli. Psychology 
is not the only science to frame a law of diminishing returns. 
Although the method of right and wrong cases is the one 
which best reveals the relation of the mental reaction to small 
differences of stimuli, the method is nevertheless more exact 
than is necessary to ascertain differences in reaction to sensory 
stimuli. The method of right and wrong cases requires many 
hundred experiments to establish any result at all; by the 
method of average error, ten experiments, in some cases even a 
single test, suffice satisfactorily to establish an exact measure 
of the sensitivity of a given subject. This method is there- 
fore most serviceable and sufficiently exact for comparative 
measurements in statistical and child psychology. 
Weber, after whom the psycho-physical law was named, 
expressed the results of the simple experiments which initiated 
so much discussion and investigation in the following words: 
“In the discrimination of objects that are compared the one with 
another, we do not perceive the difference between the objects but 
the ratio of this difference to the magnitude of the compared 
oljects.” This statement of the results of Weber’s experiments 
is not a law of sensation, but a law of perception, ¢.e., of the com- 
plex processes of observation and discrimination. The psycho- 
physical law as thus formulated is a most important contribution 
to science and gives exact expression of the facts. It contains 
no reference to the relative magnitudes of sensations and stimuli. 
It does not maintain nor does investigation demonstrate that  
-P-A-G-E-256
  218 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
the perceivable proportion is constant. In fact, with the greater 
number of stimuli the perceivable proportion is variable, being 
greater in some ranges of intensity and smaller in others. Only 
with a limited number of stimuli, and even with these only in 
ranges of medium intensity, does the perceivable proportion 
seem to remain fairly constant. In Fechner, to whose tireless 
investigation we owe an inspiring model of scientific patience 
and accuracy, was found combined the man of science and the 
ardent mystic. Perhaps the trend of his mind toward mysti- 
cism was responsible for his reading into the results of his 
scientific experiments much that they did not contain. The 
results of these experiments —as many as 76,072 experiments 
by the method of right and wrong cases with lifted weights 
alone —he formulated as a universal law establishing a fixed 
numerical relationship between sensations and stimuli. On the 
assumption that the world is divisible into mind and matter, 
and that the mind’s knowledge of matter is based entirely upon 
the sensations which it receives from the external world, the 
psycho-physical law became for him a constructive principle 
of the universe. In generalization it is second to none, not 
even to the principle of the conservation of physical energy 
established by Fechner’s contemporary, Helmholtz. No criti- 
cism can touch the methods of Fechner nor the unswerving 
devotion to science with which he carried them out. The work 
of Fechner remains an ideal of scientific attainment and a valu- 
able contribution to the facts and principles of psychology. 
The peculiar interpretation which he put upon those facts was 
due to no deficiency of observation or method. The particular 
form of the psycho-physical law in which Fechner expressed his 
results was determined by preconceptions of the nature of sen- 
sation and theories of a necessary relation between mind and 
matter; Fechner prejudged the results of the experiments 
before he had lifted a single weight.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SENSATION AS THE MENTAL ELEMENT 
Experiment XLVIII. The mental contents that are called sensa- 
tions of taste are generally combinations of taste with other sensations. 
Place upon the tongue, holding the nostrils closed so that the 
odor of the object may not be perceived through the posterior nasal 
cavities, small quantities of scraped apple, potato, turnip, or beet. 
Can you distinguish between these objects by taste alone ? 
Can you distinguish between water, tea, and coffee if a few drops 
only are placed upon the tongue? Do they seem to you different 
in taste? If so, in what respect do they differ? 
How many different qualities of taste do you think you can 
distinguish? 
Describe ten different odors with which you are familiar. Can 
you give names to odors? Can sensations of smell be arranged in 
a continuous series? Are sensations of smell greater in number 
than sensations of taste? 
There are but four recognizably different taste sensations. 
These are the sensation of sweet, of salt, of sour, and of bitter. 
All other taste sensations are combinations of these four tastes 
proper with sensations of touch, sensations due to the chemical 
action of a substance upon the tongue, sensations of heat and 
cold, and sensations of odor. It is practically impossible to 
distinguish one flavor from another by taste alone. Tea and 
coffee mixed with milk, as in the customary breakfast cup, are 
indistinguishable from hot milk by the sense of taste alone. 
Taste sensations comprise four qualities not related to one 
another as are color sensations. If they are to be represented 
219
-P-A-G-E-258
  220 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
diagrammatically they cannot be placed on the same straight line 
as are auditory sensations, but must be represented by four 
different lines, one for each 
quality. Each line then repre-

the intensity of each taste.

those of taste. Scientific 
analysis has not been able to arrange odors in a satisfactory 
classification according to common properties or characteristics 
possessed by different groups. This is quite in accordance 
with the inability of language to find appropriate names for 
odors similar to those for taste. Odorous substances are dis- 
tinguished only with reference to the objects which give rise 
to similar odors, as a violet odor, a pitchy smell. The qualities 
of smell are manifold, but do not arrange themselves in a 
continuous series as do sensations of sound and color. 
Experiment XLIX. The psychical discreteness of heat and cold 
sensations. 
Touch to the skin some metal object heated to a temperature 
greater than that of the body. Allow it to cool gradually until it 
ceases to give a sensation of heat. Cool it considerably below the 
temperature of the body and observe the sensation of cold which 
you receive from it. Allow it to increase in warmth until it feels 
neither cold nor hot. Does the sensation of heat differ in quality 
or only in intensity from that of cold? 
A confusion of the standpoint of psychical analysis with the 
physical standpoint is apt to cause the psychologist as well 
as the student to look upon the sensation of cold as merely 
intensively different from the sensation of heat. If one regard 
only the mental characteristics of the sensations, heat is one
-P-A-G-E-259
  SENSATION AS THE MENTAL ELEMENT 221 
sensation of varying degrees of intensity, and cold is a quali- 
tatively discrete sensation -also presented in varying intensities. 
Thus there are two qualities of temperature sensation, heat and 
cold, each having a considerable range of possible intensities. 
A single line will represent the sensations of heat, any point in

the line standing for a heat sensation of a given intensity. But 
a second line, not continuous with the first, is needed to repre- 
sent the intensitieg of the cold sensation. The physical stimu- 
lus of both heat and cold, on the other hand, can be represented 
by a continuous straight line, because there is no break between 
those temperatures which are below the normal temperature of 
the body and those which are above. The break in sensation, 
however, between the mental result of a temperature lower than 
the physiological zero point and the mental result of a higher 
temperature amounts to a distinct difference in quality. 
It is sometimes difficult to tell whether the water into which 
the hand may be suddenly thrust is hot or cold. In fact, it 
often feels both hot and cold. If there are heat nerves which 
give rise to heat sensations and separate cold nerves which give 
rise to cold sensations (see page 163), it is possible for an exces- 
sive heat stimulus to affect both sets of nerves; thus hot water
-P-A-G-E-260
222 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
or an excessive cold stimulus may excite both the cold nerves 
and the heat nerves. A very cold object actually burns the 
tissue of the skin in the same way that a hot object does. It is 
therefore possible to receive both a heat and a cold sensation 
from the same object. It is also possible for the same object 
to give rise first to a sensation of heat, because it has first 
stimulated the heat nerves, and then to a sensation of cold, as 
the cold nerves become subsequently affected. 
Experiment L. The so-called feeling tone of sensation. 
Press gently the point of a pencil against the skin. Increase 
gradually the pressure until it becomes distinctly painful. Do you 
notice the sensation of touch changing gradually to one of pressure 
and then to one of pain? ‘Is the sensation of pressure an intense 
touch sensation? Do you seem to get an isolated pain sensation 
or is there always a pressure sensation mixed with the pain sensa- 
tion? Would you consider the pressure and the pain to be two 
different sensations or is the pain in this case only a painful 
pressure sensation ? 
Touch a very hot object to the skin of the arm or hand so that 
it gives a decided sensation of pain. Describe the resultant sen- 
sation or sensations. Do you feel three sensations, touch, heat, and 
pain simultaneously, or do you observe them in a characteristic 
succession ? 
Swallow a piece of ice. Does it feel cold after it is in the 
stomach? Is it painful after it is in the stomach? Do hot tea 
and coffee feel hot in the stomach or only painful? Can you dis- 
tinguish between a pain sensation, a disagreeable feeling, and the 
bodily reaction to a pain or disagreeable feeling? If so, in what 
respects do they differ ? 
The pencil point when touched gently to the skin gives rise 
to a distinctive touch sensation; when the intensity of this 
impact is increased, the sensation is more apt to be described 
as a pressure sensation. Because the pressure stimulus is
-P-A-G-E-261
  
  SENSATION AS THE MENTAL ELEMENT 223 
simply an augmentation of the touch stimulus, one is inclined 
to consider the pressure sensation as an intense touch sensation. 
A due regard for the strictly mental likeness and unlikeness of 
the sensations should lead us to distinguish the pressure sen- 
sation as one qualitatively different from the touch sensation. 
If the intensity of the impact be again increased, the pressure 
sensation becomes painful. Here also the sensation does not

change one of its characteristic qualities, but a new sensation, 
i.e., pain, has been added to the pressure sensation. Psychical 
analysis considers the painful pressure sensation as a combina- 
tion of two sensations, one of pain and one of pressure. If we 
wish to represent graphically the relation of touch, pressure, 
and pain to the physical stimulus, we should place the varying 
intensities of the pressure stimulus on the same continuous 
straight line, but we are compelled to use three different lines 
to represent the three discrete qualities of touch, pressure, and 
pain. These three lines have a length proportional to the 
number of variations in intensity of which the respective 
sensations are susceptible. 
A sensation received from any intense stimulus may be 
disagreeable, even painful; thus the bitter of quinine is
-P-A-G-E-262
  224 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
disagreeable. Any extremely loud or penetrating sound is dis- 
agreeable. Odors are accompanied by similar elements of agree- 
able or disagreeable feeling. This fact has given rise to a theory 
that all sensations conie into consciousness with a feeling tone as 
an integral part. The sensation is thus considered to possess 
three characteristics, its quality, its intensity, and its feeling 
tone. If the requirements of introspective analysis are adhered 
to, it is necessary whenever two qualities of sensation are dis- 
tinguishable to treat these not as two characteristics of one 
sensation, but as two different sensations in intimate combina- 
tion. It is therefore more ‘appropriate to maintain that every 
sensation may have associated with it a “feeling” element, 
which may be either one of agreeableness or one of disagree- 
ableness. The sensation of pain is as different and as distinct 
from all other sensations as is the sensation of color. It is also 
distinguished from agreeableness and disagreeableness. 
To explain fully the nature of this association of “feeling 
tone” with sensation would lead us far into the field of physio- 
logical psychology. It will suffice, to call attention to the fact 
that when an external stimulus acts upon the body its total effect 
is not merely the sensation ordinarily excited by it. Every stimu- 
lus produces more or less remote effects upon many portions of the 
body. Thus ammonia may stimulate the sense organ of smell 
to give rise to a sensation of smell, but it also acts through the ~ 
brain and spinal cord to affect the heart and breathing. Every 
such change in the body has a mental accompaniment which 
will be associated with the primary mental re8ultant of the 
stimulus. The reflex stimulation of remote portions of the 
body takes place so rapidly that these mental resultants are 
combined with that of the stimulus. A suffocating odor gives 
rise to a sensation of smell and also produces the changes in 
breathing that tend toward partial suffocation. The sensations 
due to suffocation are combined with the true sensation of odor. 
Although we may speak of a suffocating odor, the odor sensation
-P-A-G-E-263
  SENSATION AS THE MENTAL ELEMENT 225 
itself is not suffocating. One and the same odorous sub- 
stance produces both an odor sensation and a suffocation 
sensation. Nauseating tastes are in like manner combina- 
tions of true taste sensations with sensations due to the 
reflex stimulation of other bodily processes. ‘Thus the nausea 
element is connected with the stomach and the muscles of the 
oesophagus concerned in the reflex act of vomiting. The bitter 
sensation is almost invariably accompanied by a certain even 
though slight sensation of nausea. Other stimuli produce 
vigorous bodily reactions as well as sensations, for example 
stimuli of pain and stimuli of extreme heat and cold. Intense 
light stimuli act not only upon the retina but also upon the 
conjunctiva. They therefore produce sensations of light from 
the retina, intimately combined with sensations of pain from 
the conjunctiva. Some of the simpler emotions, for example 
fear, are characterized by mental elements due to the reflex 
effects of a stimulus. Would we “fear” a thunderstorm did 
not the intense light and sound stimuli cause the heart to 
beat violently and the breathing to become irregular, and also 
act upon the muscles to produce a temporary weakness and 
trembling of the limbs? The feeling tone of agreeableness and 
disagreeableness associated with sensations is in like manner 
due to combined elements which have an origin elsewhere in 
the body than in the sense organs and nerves directly excited 
by the stimulus. Some of the elements constituting a com- 
posite sensation have an internal physiological origin alone, 
while others have an external physical origin. 
In Chapter I it was said that a sensation as a strictly simple 
mental content does not exist, because the mental result of 
every stimulus shows some degree of modification by apper- 
ception. In the immediately preceding chapters it has been 
shown that a sensation never exists alone but always in combina- 
tion with other sensations of both external and internal origin. 
Those mental contents which the psychologist commonly
-P-A-G-E-264
226 ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY 
describes as sensations are therefore in reality sensation com- 
plexes, as, for example, a sensation of red, which is a complex of 
brightness and color sensations. It is the object of analysis to 
ascertain the particular constitution of each complex of sensation. 
In the endeavor to reach an element which shall be uncombined 
with other elements, psychology defines the sensation as a simple 
and immediate mental content, placing before itself an ideal of 
analysis rather than an actually existing mental content. 
It is not possible to classify sensations as ideally simple 
mental contents. Sensation complexes, that is, sensations as 
we actually experience them, may be classified with reference to 
their relative simplicity and specific quality, or to their physio- 
logical or physical source. Different psychologists will make 
different classifications according to the basis taken. The 
older classification of sensations into five groups or “senses” is 
based upon the relation of the sensations to the physiological 
processes of gross anatomical structures, i.e., the eye, ear, nose, 
mouth, and skin. It is aconvenient although superficial classi- 
fication ; it has no important psychological or physiological 
significance. The following classification is based upon the 
qualitative specificity of the sensations. These classes are not 
“senses” in the ordinary meaning of that term: they are 
groups of sensations arranged in order from the least to the 
most qualitatively specialized sensations. 
1. Organic sensations. These include particularly hunger 
and thirst and those vague sensations dependent upon a dif- 
fused internal stimulation anywhere within the body. It is 
probable that different portions of the body give rise to general 
organic sensations differing slightly from sensations of similar 
origin elsewhere. Thus the right arm may have a different 
“feel” from the left arm, owing to the regional quality of the 
organic sensations therein excited. 
2. Kinaesthetic sensations. These differ qualitatively de- 
pending upon the region of the body from which they come.
-P-A-G-E-265
  
SENSATION AS THE MENTAL ELEMENT 227 
Closely connected with these are sensations of rotation and 
dizziness and the other sensations arising from the maintenance 
of bodily equilibrium through the codrdinated action of the 
muscles. Kinaesthetic sensations are important elements of 
visual and auditory sensations, and in fact it is impossible to 
prove that any sensation exists without some admixture of 
kinaesthetic sensation. 
3. Sensations of tickle, tingling, motion over the skin, and 
the like. 
4. Sensations of touch, pressure, heat, cold, pain, salt, sour, 
sweet, bitter, and sensations of smell. These are placed in one 
class as being of about the same order or degree of specificity. 
5. Auditory sensations. 
6. Retinal sensations. Combined with kinaesthetic sensa- 
tions from the muscles of the eye, these are commonly known 
as visual sensations.

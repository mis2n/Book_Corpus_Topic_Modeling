‘* ARNOLD’s GREEK AND Latin Series.—The publication of this valuable colleetion of 
classical school books may be regarded as the presage of better things in respect to the mode of 
teaching and acquiring languages. Heretofore boys have been condemned to the drudgery of going 
over Latin and Greek Grammar without the remotest conception of the value of what they were 
learning, and every day becoming more and more disgusted with the dry and unmeaning task ; bat 
now, by Mr. Arnold’s admirable method-—substantially the same with that of Oliendorif—the mo- 
ment they take up the study of Latin or Greek, they begin to learn sentences, to acquire ideas, to see 
how the Romans and Greeks ex pressed themselves, how their mode of ex pression diflered from ours, 
and by degrees they lay up a stock of knowledge which is utterly astonishing to those who have 
dragged on month after month in the old-fashioned, dry, and tedious way of learning languages. 
“Mr. Arnold, in fact, has had the good sense to adopt the system of nature. A child learns 
his own language by imitating what he hears, and constantly repeating it till it is fastened in 
the memory ; in the same way Mr. A. puts the pupil immediately to work at Exercises in Latin 
and Greek, involving the elementary principles of the language-—words are supplied—the mode 
of putting them together is told the pupil—he is shown how the ancients expressed their ideas; 
and then, by repeating these things again and again—iterum iterumque—the docile pupil has 
them indelibly impressed upon his memory and rooted in his understanding. 5 
‘The American Editor is a thorough classical scholar, and has been a practical teacher for 
ears in this city. He has devoted the utmost care to a complete revision of Mr. Arnold’s works, 
as corrected several errors of inadvertence or otherwise, has rearranged and improved various 
tters in the early volumes of the series, and has attended most diligently to the accurate print- 
17 and mechanical execution of the whole. We anticipate most confidently the speedy adop- 
ion: of these works in our schools and colleges.’’— Cour. & Eng. 
 *,* Arnold’s Series of Classical Works has attained a circulation almost unparalleled in Eng 
land, being introduced into nearly all the great Public Schools and leading Edueational nstitutions.

GeNnTLEMEN —In reply to your letter, I have to say that I can, from the most satisfactory 
atin bear dashes the excellence of your series of Text Books for Schools. I am is 
the daily ase of Arnold’s Latin and Greek Exercises, and consider them decidedly superior to any 
ether Elementary Works in those Languages. LYMAN COLEMAN, D., D., 
Prof. of the German, Greek, and Latin Languages. 
    Deak Sir,—I am much pleased with Arnold’s Latin Books. A class of my older boys 
have just finished the first and second books, They had studied Latin for a long time before 
but never understood it, they say, as they do now. CHAS. M. BLAKE, j 
Classical ‘Teacher in Brown's Prince-street Academy, Philadelphia. 
ARNo.p’s Lessons in Latin I find unsurpassed ; and, if the Greek Lessons by the same 
author shall prove as useful, they will form the commencement of a new era in the study of the 
classics in this country. I wish you abundant success in so noble an enterprise as furnishing our 
schools and scholars with such valuable books. SETH DAVIS, 
Rector of Zion’s Church, Rome. 
       
   
      
     
   
       
    
      
  Arnott Latin anp Greex Composition. In the skill with which he sets forth the 
idiomatic peculiarities, as well as in the directness and simplicity with which he states the facts 
of the Ancient Languages, Mr. Arnold has no superior. I know of no books so admirably 
adapted to awaken an interest im the study of language, or so well fitted to lay the foundation 
of a correct scholarship and refined taste. N. WHEELER, ) 
Principal Worcester County High Scaool. 
  Messrs. APPLETON : Penn. Cotteaez, Gettryspura, Oct, 29, 1846. 
Dear Sirs,—The friends of education are under great obligations to you for the valualte service 
you have rendered by the recent publication of Amold’s Cornelius Nepos. I have examined 
the edition with much interest, and it gives me pleasure to say that I highly approve of it. 
text-book prepared by a man so distinguished for scholarship, experience, and success in teaching, 
as Dr. Arnold, cannot fail to secure universal favor. The mechanical execution, and the great 
— which prevails throughout, are highly creditable to the American editor and the 
publisher. 
I have determined to introduce the edition at once into the Academical Department of 
Pennsyivania College, and have accordingly directed our book merchants to procure copies. 
Respectfully, yours, 
M. L. STOERER, A. M., 
Prof. of History in Pennsylvania College, and Principal of the Academical Department. 
  
Messrs. Aprpteton & Co. : Oak and Hien Scuoon, April 23, 1846. 
Gentlemen,—I acknowledge with many thanks the receipt of T. K. Arnold’s First and 
Second Latin Book, and his Introduction to Latin Prose Composition. The style in which the 
books are got up is not their only recommendation. With thorough instruction, on the part of 
the teacher using these books as text-books, I am confident a much more ample return for the 
time and labor bestowed by our youth upon Latin must be secured. The time certainly has 
come when an advance must be made upon the old methods of instruction. I am glad to have 
a work that promises so many advantages as Arnold’s First and Second Latin Book to begin 
T have little doubt of the result of the experiment. Very respectfully, 
A. B. RUSSELL. 
  Extract from a Report of an Examination of the Male Department of the Parochial School of 
St. Paul’s Church, Rome, N. Y., on Friday, March 26, 1847. 
* * * * “ But were we to single ont any part of the examination as worthy of special notice, 
* would be that upon ‘‘ Arnold’s First Book in Latin.’? Many an Academician, whv has studied Latin in the ordinary way for two years, could not sustain an examination as did the lads of this class, who have studied Arnold’s First Lessons only about six months. Armold’s 
method is admirable for making thorough scholars and accurate grammarians ; but then it needs a thorongh and industrious teacher to use it to advantage. Such, evidently, is Mr. Platt. He has not been content to put his pupils upon writigg out the exercises, but they keve been required to commit thoroughly to memory the vocabulty of words in each Jesson, beginning with nouns and verbs; and as soon as they have learned ihe words they begin to make sentences, Then they learn oceasionally a declension, and immediately are made to put it to use by con- a that require the cases of that declension. A similar method was pursued in the h Grammar and in the French.’’

  PREFACE 
THE present volume contains the First’ Part of Mr. Arnold’s 
Practical Introduction to Latin Prose Composition ; the introduc. “ges 
tory portion of the Second Part (as published by the Author) on 
the Order of Words in Latin; and nearly all the Longer Latin — 
Exercises, Part I., a work wink was published separately, jiiee pS 
intended to follow imanbdiately-4 in order the use of the First Part — 
of the Prose Composition. 
‘This arrangement was adopted for the purpose of embracing 
as much valuable matter as possible within the compass of a rea- 4 
sonably sized volume. The First Part is complete in itself, + 
so far‘as it goes, admirably fulfils the design of the author; yet, 
as the Exercises consist of single, short; and inconieeted sen- 
tences, it was deemed advisable to introduce other and longer Ex- _ 
ercises, in which the student should be taught practically how to_ << 
arrange his ideas in passages of considerable length, and in which — 
are involved most of the minutize and intricacies of the Latin = 
idiom. For this purpose Part II. « present volume is most | 
excellently adapted. The work on the Latin - Particles, which — 4 
was published by the author‘as the Second Part of the Practical — 
Introduction to Latin Prose Composition, is a production of much 4 
value and importance, and is devoted to a lengthened and full elu- 
cidation of the difficulties which stand in the way of one who — 
would become a thorough and accomplished Latinist. It is in- 
tended—should the classical public demand it—to issue this work 
at an early date. | 
The principal advantages which the present volume offers over 
works of a similar kind are these. It contains a copious but con- 
cise illustration of Latin Synonymes drawn mainly from the 
standard treatise of Déderlein on this subject; there is, through-

. 
out, a careful and precise notation of the Differences of Idiom 
between the Latin and English languages; a frequent calling 
the attention of the student, by way of Cautions, to nice points 
_which might otherwise escape his notice; and a constant repeti- 
_ tion, under new forms and combined with new matter, of what has 
gone before—the iterum iterumque of Virgil—till both the words 
and expressions, with their peculiarities, are fastened in the mem- 
ory. In addition to this, the Exercises are wholly in English, 
that is, the English is given to be turned into the corresponding 
Latin ; and full and very carefully arranged Vocabularies pre- 
cede or accompany each Exercise. This plan-is far superior— 
in the Editor’s judgment—to the common mode of giving all the 
Latin words in the Latin order, simply requiring that the sentence 
- be made grammatically correct by the use of the right cases, 
‘moods, tenses, &c. By. such a course the pupil is not obliged to 
study and exercise his powers of reflection and observation to any 
great extent ; but only to be tolerably well acquainted with gram- 
matical forms and usages; he learns to expect the helps of the 
Latin words; he pays littleregard to the peculiarities of the Latin 
order; and is very apt to be sadly puzzled when an English sen- 
tence or passage is given to him to be turned into Latins Om the — 
contrary, by using Mr. Arnold’s method the student is compelled 
to examine well and constantly the mode which the Romans ‘had 
of expressing their ideas, and in what respect it differs. from our 
_ Own, as well in regard to the choice as the collocation of words 
and sentences; and almost of necessity his memory has to be 
stored with a large supply of words and phrases for continual 
use. } 
Great care has been bestowed upon the volume, for the purpose 
of securing accuracy and clearness of arrangement; and it is 
trusted that it will not be found inferior to any issues of the 
American press.

beads INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 
On the Lasaiyoraent of Words in a Latin Sentence. 
1. The general distinetion between ihe English and Latin order ¥ 
is this : a 
2. (In Latin the governed and dependent words generally 
stand before the words on which they depend; so that in simple 
sentences, the verb, when not particularly emphatic, stands at the 
end of the sentence. ‘ 
8. Thus in simple sats after. ‘the conjunction: ¢ comes the 
subject (nom. case) ; ;-then the governed cases with. adverbs and 
expressions of time, place, manner, &c., and last of all the verb. 
4. But if the verb is emphatic, it must be placed earlier in the 
- sentence.—Quod non dedit fortuna, id non eripit. — Mirabile 4 
videtur, quod non rideat haruspex, &c. Non intelligunt homines, 
quam magnum, vectigal sit parsimonia. a 
For it must always be remembered that— & 
5. i The degree of prominence and emphasis to be given. to 3 
a word, is that. which mainly deleingaees its. position in the sen- | 
tence. —And, 
6. a) The two emphatic positions in a sefitence: are the ingioning eles the end; 
“by the former our attention is excited, and on the latter it r 0 (Crom- 
bie.) d 
b) Add to this, that the more unusual a position is for any word, the more — 
emphatic it is for that word. Thus, “arbores seret sigur sgricola, 
quarum adspiciet baccam ipse nunquam.” (Cic.) ; 
c) A word that generally stands close by another receives | emphasis by - 
separation from it ; especially if it be thus brought near the beginning or 
end of a sentence. Voluptatem’ percepi maximam’. Propterea quod 
aliud iter haberent nullum’. didui equites ad Cwsarem omnes! rever- 
tuntur. oe 
.@) Another principle affecting the position of words is the harmonious 
» arrangement of syllables; the flow of the sentence,

14 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 
7. Genitive. The genitive, whether dependent on a_sub- 
stantive or adjective, stands first if it be the more emphatic ; if 
not, not. But it is rendered more. emphatic by separation : 
see 6, c). 
a) It probably somewhat prefers the position before the govern- 
ing noun, when that is not decidedly emphatic. 
b) When the governing substantive has. an adjective with it, . 
the order is generally adj., gen., subst. (Vera animi magnitudo.) 
8.° ArrRIBUTIVE AND ITS SUBSTANTIVE. Of these the more 
emphatic stands first. But see 6, c). 
a. A very short precedes a longer word: hence the demon- 
stralives usually stand before their nouns, and monosyllable sub- 
slantives before their adjectives. 
9. Apposition. Here too the more éinphatic precedes: but 
generally the word in apposition stands last. 
a. This is particularly the case with détles, &e., in apposition to 
proper names. 
Q. Mucius Avgur; Agis rex ; Pyitleneti Philosophus. But, 
urbs Roma ; though Cyprus insula, Hypanis fluvius. 
10. Woos DEPENDENT ON Apjectives. Here too the more 
emphatic - precedes, with something of a preference for placing 
the dependent words first. 
11. Apnative apsotuTe. The more emphatic first. 
12. INFINITIVE DEPENDENT ON VERB. The more emphatic first ; 
generally the infinitive. | 
a. Of two infinitives, the more emphatic first. 
13. Apverss. Generally, immediately before the words they 
belong to. (Quoque immediately after its word. 
14. Words that modify the meaning of an adjective are usually 
placed between it and the substantive. (Preelio magis ad.eventum 
, secundo, quam, &c.) 
15. Opposition and contrasted notions. 
a) A repeated word, or a*word akin to a word already used in 
the sentence, is generally brought as near to that word as possible: 
Timor timorem pellit. Nulla virtus virtuti contraria est. Virtutum 
in alid alius vult excellére. Aliis aliunde est periculum. 
6) Of two contrasted clauses or groups of words, of parallel

  ® The verb is often however in the singular, agreeing with one’of the nomi- 
natives, and being understood with the other. This is the common construc- 
tion with et—et; quum—tum, &c., when both the nominatives are singular, and 
of the same person.

the third. | 
¢ For “ Balbusand J,” the Romans, putting “J” first, said ““ Ego et Balbus.” 
When therefore Cardinal Wolsey said “ Ego et Rex meus,” he was a good 
grammarian but bad courtier. 
d Er joins words each of which is considered independently, and as of equal 
importance: ATQUE ( = adque) or ac, which is an abridged (and less emphatie) 
form of the same word, adds a notion that is, if anything, of more importance 
than the preceding one (= ‘and also,’ ‘and moreover’): que joins a word 
closely to another, as an appendage to it, as belonging to it, and often as forming 
one complex notion with it. 
‘When ef connects principal clauses, subordinate ones and single words must 
be connected by que, or (if similar notions) atque. 
Atque is used before vowels or consonants, but especially before vowels. 
Ac is used before consonants (though not very often before the k sounds); but 
not before vowelsorh. Mr. Allen shows that ac (though very rarely met with 
oreg, q) is not very uncommon in Cicero before c. So also Zumpt. —

§ 2. Accusative with Infinitive. 
6. The infinitive takes before tt not the nominative, but the 
accusative.§ | 
7. Many sentences that in English are joined to a verb by the conjunc- 
tion that,’ are expressed in Latin by the accusative and infinitive: 
8. In.turning such sentences into Latin ‘that’? must be omitted; the 
English nominative turned into the accusative; and the English verb 
into the infinitive mood of the same tense. 
The accusative with the infinitive follows verbs (sentiendi et decla- 
randi) of feeling, knowing; wishing, hearing, believing, thinking, &c. ; 
and Such expressions as, itis certain, man nifeat, true, &C. « 
e Per in composition with an adjective, adds to it the meaning of ‘ very.’ 
f Exercitusque. Que must always be appended to the latter of the two words 
connected by it. 
‘8 This idiom is not uncommon in English, though far less common than i in 
Latin. |

  PREFACE 
The primary purpose of THe Minp at Work is to furnish in 
convenient form standard readings on the activities of study- 
ing, thinking, and reading, as treated in this book. Upon 
these subjects much good advice has been given; but it is not 
easily accessible in printed form for high-school, normal-schbol, 
or college classes. Libraries contain many of the selections 
reprinted in this volume and some of the others named in 
the bibliographies attached to the various chapters, but in ordi- 
nary school work references to them are few and scattering. 
With this dearth of easily available material in mind, an en- 
deavor has been made to assemble source readings on the sub- 
jects named, in content and style suitable for use in the upper 
years of high school and the lower years of normal school and 
college. The author has thought of the volume primarily as a 
source book. He hopes that the selections may give students 
easy access to valuable information and guidance in the chief 
activities of school life. i 
Dr. Charles W. Eliot has said that “the most important step 
toward getting mental power is the acquisition of a right 
method in work.” Dr. Eliot is no advocate of the theory that 
students unguided will blunder into good habits of reading, 
thinking, and studying. .Lamenting the fact that courses of 
study quite generally fail to provide direct instruction concern- 
ing various ways of ascertaining and using facts in modern life, 
he pleads for “innumerable lessons in mental truth-seeking and 
truth-telling.” During the past decade other educators have 
realized that students should be trained directly in the mental 
processes that underlie effective thinking and studying. Several 
volumes upon these and kindred subjects have been addressed to 
teachers, and at least two excellent elementary how-to-study 
manuals have been designed for use as textbooks in junior high- 
school classes. But apparently no textbook treating the activi- 
ties of studying, thinking, and reading in their proper relations

  4 PREFACE 
has been prepared for more advanced students at the time their 
maturity warrants a simple analysis of mental processes. In an 
endeavor to meet this apparent need, THE Minp at Work leads 
pupils to be aware of the mental activities they are using, analyz- 
ing with and for them the essential elements of good school work 
as contrasted with bad. Moreover, the discussions presented 
here constitute an elementary course in the practical logic 
needed in everyday life, both in school and out of it. 
Tue Minp at Work is intended to be more than a source 
book. It is a practice book, organized by chapters which cover 
the more important mental activities of school and practical 
life. Each chapter contains an untechnical analysis of certain 
mental habits which are to be acquired, presents in line with 
the chapter topic several standard readings of high merit, and 
provides a variety of topics for investigation, suggestions for 
further reading, and other problems which furnish practical 
subject-matter for oral and written composition. 
Tue Minp at Work may profitably be used in any one of 
four ways: (1) It may be substituted for one of the several 
elassies which constitute a year’s work in most English classes; 
(2) It may supplement the customary study of essays, orations, 
and addresses; (3) It may be used as a basie textbook in special 
courses designed to introduce students to effective methods of 
study; (4) It may be taken up once a week throughout a se- 
mester as the basis of direct lessons in the mental activities neces- 
sary for successful study both within school and without. It is 
hoped that departments of English and of social sciences espe- 
cially will find the training here outlined a valuable ally. 
The author expresses his indebtedness to Professors S. Chester 
Parker and William 8. Gray of The University of Chicago for 
helpful suggestions in preparation of the manuscript. He 
acknowledges also the generous permissions to use copyrighted 
materials granted by various publishers named throughout the 
volume.

CHAPTER ONE 
Tur Nature oF Stupy AND or Stupy Hasits 
Improving one’s effectiveness in study is largely a matter 
of developing better form in reading, and better habits of 
listening, observing, thinking, and applying. 
SECTION I 
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN STUDYING, 
THINKING, AND READING 
A TEXTBOOK OF A DIFFERENT KIND 
This book, which considers good habits of using the mind, 
is different in content and in purpose from most textbooks. A 
textbook in history, for example, presents a connected discussion 
of a certain portion of the world’s events, suggests supple- 
mentary readings, and propounds questions and problems for 
solution. But very seldom, if ever, does a textbook in history 
lay upon the student the obligation of thinking about his own 
methods of work or lead him to analyze the mental activities 
by which he is carrying on his study. , The usual textbook in 
any subject does not focus the student’s attention on himself, 
on what he is doing and the manner in which he is working, 
it rightly lays stress upon the facts and relationships of its 
subject-matter, upon the applications to be made, and upon the 
problems to be solved. 
THE STUDY OF HABITS OF WORK 
In contrast, this book endeavors to turn the attention of the 
worker upon himself, assisting him, as a student, to analyze his 
18
-P-A-G-E-14
14 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
activities in studying, thinking, and reading. Instead of direct- 
ing attention primarily to the actual facts of a study, Taz Minp 
aT Work gives direct lessons in habits of study, in various 
aspects of reflecting, judging, and applying. It constantly re- 
quires students to pay careful attention to what they are doing 
with their minds. It emphasizes the fact that while they are 
working upon school tasks they are making their minds, and that 
therefore they ought to be definitely aware of what they are 
doing and why. 
Throughout the discussions, the activities of reading, of think- 
ing, and of studying are considered as three aspects of the one 
process by which we learn to use materials which we find in 
printed form. All are activities of the mind. We read serious 
books to get ideas; we think about them to see what these ideas 
mean; we study ideas and their meanings, endeavoring to make 
them our permanent possessions and to get ready to use them in 
problems of our own. Of course there are certain kinds of 
studying not based on reading. We may plan the substance of 
a composition without reading at all. Other kinds of school 
work, like manipulating a machine, have little relation to read- 
ing. We often work hard over a problem in mathematics which 
requires little or no preliminary reading. But we are consider- 
ing here that portion of our work which requires reading, think- 
ing, and studying at one and the same time. 
READING SYMBOLS AND READING MEANINGS 
There are two kinds of reading, the first of which may be 
called the mere recognition of written or printed symbols; and 
the second, the recognition of the meaning conveyed by such 
written or printed symbols. The mere act of recognizing printed 
words is reading in its narrowest sense; it is not a thinking proc- 
ess. Indeed, such recognition is not reading as that activity is to 
be considered throughout this book. A child first learning to 
read endeavors to master printed symbols in order that he 
may instantly recognize them and the ideas for which they  
-P-A-G-E-15
  STUDYING, THINKING, AND READING 15 
stand. Thus, a child, as he looks at the three words, endeavors 
to recognize the idea: “The—dog—runs.” How hard it is at first! 
But from the very beginning of reading experience, the three 
words “The dog runs” are to the child more than words; they 
represent a story, a very insignificant tale to adults, but not to 
a six-year-old. 
‘When the reader sees that the words which he recognizes and 
pronounces tell a story, he begins to read more directly in 
terms of meanings. Soon the time comes when the mere recogni- 
tion of words is very largely mechanical; then with little atten- 
tion necessary for the words themselves, his mind is free to think 
of the story or the meanings for which the words stand. Ulti- 
mately, “knowing how to read” changes completely from the 
recognition of printed symbols to the recognition and re-creation 
in the reader’s mind of the ideas which the writer recorded upon 
the page. 
We can use a parallel in learning to read music. A pretty 
painful process it is, that laborious picking out of the proper 
keys when one first begins! Gradually the difficulty disappears. 
Finally the musician sits at his instrument and runs his hands 
lightly over the keyboard, unconsciously performing with ra- 
pidity and skill acts which were once painfully slow. He now 
reads mere notes and phrases without effort and executes them 
with ease. His mind is free to dwell upon what the composer is 
saying, what the music means. In other words, the skilled per- 
former’s mind goes beyond the symbols, beyond the mechanics, 
into the realm of interpretation. He thinks, feels, lives his 
music. In a somewhat similar way, a skilled reader goes beyond 
symbols, and thinks, feels, and lives the meanings of the printed 
page. 
For our purposes, the recognition of a writer’s meaning and 
the reproduction of it in the reader’s mind may be ealled 
reading in a restricted sense. One reads a photograph in this 
manner when he recognizes in it a likeness of father or Alice or 
Abraham Lincoln. He knows the face, and he knows what the
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
face means. Then, possibly he begins to “read” or interpret the 
picture in a very different way; he begins to reflect upon it. 
‘What do those lines in the forehead mean? How many times 
has he seen that smile! How well he knows that firm jaw! What 
memories of the person’s affection or service are at beck and eall! 
Possibly as he studies the photograph he reflects about the mean- 
ing of that life, and turns the picture this way and that to let 
the light fall upon it better—all because he wants the photograph 
to help him think. Similarly, in true reading, a reader passes 
from the earlier stage of recognizing what a book says to him to 
the later stage of realizing what a book means for him. He not 
only recognizes the thoughts of the writer, but also reflects 
upon them. He may not literally tip the book as he did the 
photograph; but he figuratively tips a paragraph or a chapter 
upside down, finds the heart of a portion of it, and dwells upon 
what it stands for, in addition to recognizing what it says. In 
short, a skilled reader interprets; he makes the writer’s thoughts 
his thoughts, and he builds upon them new thoughts of his own. 
THINKING IS REFLECTION 
It appears, then, that reading and studying are closely related. 
And thinking is related to both when the student begins to 
reflect upon what he reads. “Learning what the book says,” 
without thinking, is one form of studying; thus we sometimes 
study a rule in grammar, a declension in Latin, a formula in 
algebra, learning by heart something the full meaning of which 
we have not yet grasped. Fortunately, such experiences of mere 
memory work are rare. We know today that a good student 
considers earnestly the meaning and significance of what he is 
studying before he tries to remember it. The more clearly we 
understand, the more easily we remember. 
And usually “studying” a book means more than an endeavor 
to remember. It means striving to understand; it means finding 
the essence of a paragraph or of a series of paragraphs, consider- 
ing their meaning, estimating their worth, tying up that meaning
-P-A-G-E-17
STUDYING, THINKING, AND READING 17 
with something that is already in our own experience, planning 
how we can put that meaning to work in problems of our own. 
While we are studying, we know that certain questions will cer- 
tainly arise: That is what the writer says, but what of it? 
What does it signify? Why is it true? Can support be found 
for it? Where is its weakness? Who made use of it? Here is 
a problem that involves the principle; solve it! And in antici- 
pating such problems, in trying to answer them as we sit before 
our books, we are thinking. 
The relation between studying, reading, and thinking may be 
represented by this diagram: 
(1) Reapinc—Recognizing meanings: grasping the 
thought presented in printed symbols. 
(2) Tuinxrxe—Interpreting meanings: reflecting 
STUDYING upon the significance of the thought in the 
light of one’s own experience. 
(3) Uriizinc—Making use of meanings: applying 
the thought to solve some problems of one’s 
own. 
For example, if the reader of this discussion is earnestly study- 
ing at the present moment, he is trying to recognize the thought 
presented here; he is considering the significance of the thought 
by comparing the proposed work with his other school activities, 
and he is, at the moment he reads these very words, utilizing the 
thought in getting ready to use this book. Based on his reading, 
his mental activity, as he reflects, is “thinking.” 
Although there are forms of study other than those in which 
such thinking is involved, this book aims to emphasize the impor- 
tance of thinking as the intelligent method of learning, con- 
trasted with such methods as mechanical memorization, or the 
mastery of a mass of uninterpreted facts, which to a student are 
often quite meaningless, or indistinct in meaning. Various prob- 
lems inserted throughout the text aim to stimulate interest in 
the subjects of reading, thinking, and studying to such an extent 
that the student may gain information through his own inquiries. 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
In short, Tum Mrnp at Work constantly attempts to emphasize 
the importance of inquiry in the learning process when the 
activities of reading, thinking, and studying are the methods 
employed in learning. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Throughout THe Minp ar Work are many questions, topics, indi- 
vidual problems, and group projects. Choose for your own the prob- 
lems which seem to you most appropriate for yourself, or work upon 
assignments made by your instructor. You will find it helpful to 
record and preserve the products of your own activities in a loose- 
leaf notebook to be used very much as you use laboratory books in 
history, science, or mathematics. Label your notebook, “Laboratory 
Record of the Way My Mind Works.” 
Fix firmly in your mind the distinction which defines all original 
work as constructive in contrast with the mere learning and remem- 
bering of any kind of information. Sometimes, indeed, it is our main 
business to study details: we learn declensions and conjugations in 
foreign languages; we master certain facts and principles of science 
and mathematics; we gain absolute command over specific facts in 
history or civics or literature. We make such data a part of our store 
of information. This type of learning is called acquiring knowledge. 
We must never forget that abundant and accurate information, the 
basis of all sound thinking, is probably the chief objective of all work 
in school. : 
At other times we are called upon to make use of the information 
we have in stock. We are required to apply in a new situation mate- 
rials which we have learned and perhaps may have previously used in 
a different way. Such work is a real test of intelligence, because it 
involves the constructive activity of the mind, as contrasted with the 
mere learning or acquiring activity. In the latter, memory is chiefly 
called into play; in the former, reasoning predominates. A stenog- 
rapher performs his tasks by formula; the records he takes in short- 
hand, and the transcribing of those records into typewritten form are 
activities which he performs more or less without thought. In short, 
the stenographer’s expertness depends largely upon memory and upon
-P-A-G-E-19
  STUDYING, THINKING, AND READING 19 
manual dexterity. On the contrary, the merchant who dictates impor- 
tant business letters needs to be skillful in fields which defy the use 
of formulas. Each purchase, or sale, or adjustment is an emergency 
presenting its own peculiar difficulties; a merchant’s expertness 
depends upon his mental alertness in meeting problems which cannot 
be solved by rule of thumb. With this distinction in mind, someone 
has defined education as “growth in the power of successful behavior 
in view of differing emergencies.” 
Investigations, Problems, and Projects 
1. At the beginning of your work in this course, write out a state- 
ment of from three to five of your habits of study; show them to 
your instructor; keep them secret from others if you prefer. Consider 
such issues as these: Do you work regularly, at definite periods? Have 
you a study schedule? Do you waste time getting started? Do you 
work intensively? Do you permit distractions? Do you seek a quiet 
room? Is your study primarily an attempt to remember? Do you talk 
aloud to yourself about important points? Do you write out the essen- 
tials of your lessons? Let this be a critical self-examination. 
2. Take the first opportunity to observe carefully—without letting 
him know—one of the honor students of your school while he is 
studying. You can notice at least a few of his habits. Make notes of 
your observations. 
3. Interview a lawyer or a clergyman about his reading, asking him 
if he reads differently at different times. Write your interview as if 
reporting for a student paper. 
4, “Getting at the heart of the matter.” Recall an instance in which 
you have avoided side issues, passing by unimportant matters to reach 
at once the very heart of a question or problem. 
5. Report an experience orally in class, using one of these or a 
similar topic: 
(a) When I wasted time on the outskirts of a job. 
(b) Agonizing over getting started; only fifteen minutes left 
for work. 
(c) A definite purpose I recently had in one of my studies. 
(d) An experience I had in “a hit-or-miss method of investi- 
gation.”

    20 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
§. Various types of reading may be approached with differing pur- 
poses. Examine the four types of reading situations below, as named 
by F. M. MeMurry, and add four examples of your own of problems 
which call for reading or studying with differing purposes. 
(a) Examining the catalogues of several colleges to determine 
which to attend. 
(b) Studying the English sparrow to find whether it is useful 
or harmful. 
(c) Examining Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Speech,” making ready 
to convince others of its excellence. 
(d) Reading a newspaper with the purpose of telling news to 
a friend. 
Add four examples of reading problems approached with differing 
purposes.

7. Recount an experience in which you began to read an article 
because it was an assigned task; before you had finished, you forgot 
the requirement because you found a purpose for the reading other 
than “getting a lesson.” 
8. Informal debate: Can “studying to get high marks” in any legiti- 
mate sense be considered a worthy purpose in school work? If not, 
what do you propose as a substitute for marks? 
9. It is easy to name some books that are “just to be read”; others 
that “you want to think about”; others that “require study.” Try nam- 
ing such books from your recent school or home reading. 
10. Discussion: Answer the questions below, “yes” or “no,” and 
explain your affirmative or negative. 
(a) Can one read without thinking? 
(b) Read and think without studying? 
(c) Can one study without thinking? 
(d) Study without reading? 
(e) Think without reading? 
(f) Can one really apply himself to a book in the truest sense 
without reading, studying, and thinking?

THE NATURE OF STUDY AND ITS PRINCIPAL 
FACTORS! 
F, M. McMurry 
Reading Suggestions 
The diagram on page 17 shows that studying, when the term is 
applied to the use of books, is a joint process of reading, thinking, and 
utilizing. It is fitting that the first selection which you are asked to 
read should present the chief characteristics of good habits of study. 
The following article lays the foundation for many of the important 
principles which are discussed in greater detail in succeeding chapters 
of this book. 
Read the entire article slowly and thoughtfully, trying to find answers 
to these questions: ‘ 
(1) What seven leading factors of efficient study are named and 
discussed by MeMurry ? 
(2) What is the chief difference between mere guesswork and real 
thinking in solving a problem? 
(3) What occasions and conditions in your own daily life eall for 
careful thinking and earnest study? 
HOW THE DEMAND FOR STUDY ARISES 
Our physical movements ordinarily take place in response to 
a need of some sort. For instance, a person wishing to reach a 
certain point, to play a certain game, or to lay the foundations 
for a house, makes such movements as are necessary to accom- 
plish the purpose desired. Even mere physical exercise grows 
out of a more or less specific feeling of need.

  29 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
The mental activity called study is likewise called forth in 
response to specific needs. The Eskimo, for example, compelled 
to find shelter and having only blocks of ice with which to build, 
ingeniously contrives an ice hut. For the sake of obtaining raw 
materials he studies the habits of the few wild animals about 
him, and out of these materials he manages by much invention 
to secure food, clothing, and implements. 
We ourselves, having a vastly greater variety of materials at 
hand, and also vastly more ideas and ideals, are much more 
dependent upon thinking and study. But, as in the case of the 
Eskimo, this thinking and study arise out of actual conditions, 
and from specific wants. It may be that we must contrive ways 
of earning more money; or that the arguments for protective 
tariff seem too inconsistent for comfort; or that the reports about 
some of our friends alarm us. The occasions that call forth 
thought are infinite in number and kind. But the essential fact 
is that study does not normally take place except under the 
stimulus or spur of particular conditions, and of conditions, too, 
that are unsatisfactory. 
It does not take place even then unless we become conscious 
of the strained situation, of the want of harmony between what 
is and what might be. For ages malarial fever was accepted as 
a visitation by Divine Providence, or as a natural inconvenience, 
like bad weather. People were not disturbed by lack of har- 
mony between what actually was and what might be, because 
they did not conceive the possibility of preventing the disease. 
Accordingly they took it as a matter of course, and made no 
study of its cause. Very recently, on the other hand, people 
became conscious of the possibility of exterminating malaria. 
The imagitted state [freedom from malaria] has made the real 
state more more intolerable; and, as this feeling of dissatis- 
faction has more acute, study of the cause of the disease 
has grown e intense, until it has finally been discovered. 
Thus a lively'¢ynsciousness of the unsatisfactoriness of a situa-
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE NATURE OF STUDY 23 
tion is the necessary prerequisite to its investigation ; it furnishes 
the motive for it. 
THE VARIETY OF RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND FOR STUDY 
After we have become acutely conscious of a misfit somewhere 
in our experience, the actual study done to right it varies indefi- 
nitely with the individual. The savage follows a hit-and-miss 
method of investigation, and really makes his advances by happy 
guesses rather than by close application. Charles Lamb’s “Dis- 
sertation on Roast Pig’ furnishes a typical example of such 
accidents. 
The average civilized man of the present does only a little 
better. How seldom, for instance, is the diet prescribed for a 
dyspeptic the result of any intelligent study! The true scientist, 
however, goes at his task in a careful and systematic way. Re- 
call, for instance, how the cause of yellow fever has been dis- 
covered. For years people had attributed the disease to invisible 
particles which they called “fomites.” These were supposed to 
be given off by the sick, and spread by means of their clothing 
and other articles used by them. Investigation caused this 
theory to be abandoned. Then, since Dr. J. C. Nott of Mobile 
had suggested, in 1848, that the fever might be carried by the 
mosquito, and Dr. 0. J. Finlay of Havana had declared, in 1881, 
that a mosquito of a certain kind would carry the fever from 
one patient to another, this variety of mosquito was assumed by 
Dr. Walter Reed, in 1900, to be the source of the disease, and 
was subjected to very close investigation by him. Several men 
voluntarily received its bite and contracted the fever. Soon, 
enough cases were collected to establish the probable correctness 
of the assumption. The remedy suggested—the utter destruction 
of this particular kind of mosquito, including its eggs and larve

-—was so efficacious in combating the disease in Havana in 1901, 
and in New Orleans in 1905, that the theory is now considered 
established. Thus systematic study has relieved us of one of the 
most dreaded diseases to which mankind has been subject. 
THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS IN STUDY 
An extensive study, like the investigation into the cause of 
yellow fever, contains the essential factors common to the investi- 
gation of other topics, or to study in general; for different sub- 
jects cannot vary greatly when it comes to the general method of 
their attack. An analysis, therefore, which reveals the principal 
factors in this study is likely to bring to light the main factors 
of study in general. 
(1) The finding of specific purposes as one factor in study 
If the search for the cause of yellow fever were traced more 
fully, one striking feature discovered would be the fact that the 
investigation was never aimless. The need of unraveling the 
mystery was often very pressing, for we have had three great 
epidemics of yellow fever in our own country since 1790, and 
scientists have been eager to apply themselves to the problem. 
Yet a specific purpose, in the form of a definite hypothesis! of 
some sort, was felt to be necessary before the study could pro- 
ceed intelligently. 
Thus, during the epidemic of 1793, the contagiousness of the 
disease was debated. Then the theory of “fomites” arose, and 
underwent investigation. Finally, the spread of the disease 
through the mosquito was proposed for the solution. And while 
books of reference were examined and new observations were 
collected in great number, such work was not undertaken by the 
investigators primarily for the sake of increasing their general 
knowledge, but with reference to the particular issue at hand. 
  
1Hypothesis: a proposition that is assumed or taken for granted; a theory set up 
for further investigation.
-P-A-G-E-25
THE NATURE OF STUDY 25 a 
The important question now is: Is this, in general, the way 
in which the ordinary student should work? Of course, he is 
much less mature than the scientist, and the results that he 
achieves may have no social value, in comparison. Yet, should 
his method be the same? At least, should his study likewise be 
under the guidance of specific purposes, so that these would 
direct and limit his reading, observation, and independent think- 
ing? Or would that be too narrow, indeed, exactly the wrong 
way? And, instead of limiting himself to a collection of such 
facts as help to answer the few problems that he might be able to 
set up, should he be unmindful of particular problems? Should 
he rather be a collector of facts at large, endeavoring to develop 
an interest in whatever is true, simply because it is true? Here 
are two quite different methods of study suggested. Probably the 
latter is by far the more common one among immature students. 
Yet the former is the one that, in the main, will be advocated 
in this book as a factor of serious study. 
(2) The supplementing of thought as a second factor in study 
Dr. Reed in this case went far beyond the discoveries of pre- 
vious investigators. Not only did he conceive new tests for old 
hypotheses, but he posited’ new hypotheses, as well as collected 
the data that would prove or disprove them. Thus, while he no 
doubt made much use of previous facts, he went far beyond that 
and succeeded in enlarging the confines of knowledge. That is a 
task that can be accomplished only by the most mature and 
gifted of men. 
The ordinary scholar must also be a collector of facts. But he 
must be content to be a receiver rather than a contributor of 
knowledge; that is, he must occupy himself mainly with the ideas 
of other persons, as presented in books or lectures or conversa- 
tion. Even when he takes up the study of nature, or any other 
field, at first hand, he is generally under the guidance of a 
teacher or some text.   
3Posited: made, or set up. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
Now, how much, if anything, must he add to what is directly 
presented to him by others? To what extent must he be a pro- 
ducer in that sense? Are authors, at the best, capable only of 
suggesting their thought, leaving much that is incomplete and 
even hidden from view? And must the student do much supple- 
menting, even much digging, or severe thinking of his own, in 
order to get at their meaning? Or do authors—at least the 
greatest of them—say most, or all, that they wish, and make their 
meaning plain? And is it, accordingly, the duty of the student 
merely to follow their presentation without enlarging upon it 
greatly? 
The view will hereafter be maintained that any good author 
leaves much of such work for the student to do. Any poor 
author certainly leaves much more. 
(3) The organization of facts collected as a third factor in study 
The scientist would easily lose his way among the many facts 
that he gathers for examination, did he not carefully select and 
bring them into order. He arranges them in groups according 
to their relations, recognizing a few as having supreme impor- 
tance, subordinating many others to these, and casting aside 
many more because of their insignificance. This all constitutes 
a large part of his study. 
What duty has the less mature student in regard to organiza- 
tion? Should the statements that he receives be put into order 
by him? Are some to be selected as vital, others to be grouped 
under these, and still others to be slighted or even entirely omit- 
ted from consideration, because of their insignificance? And is 
he to determine all this for himself, remembering that thorough 
study requires the neglect of some things as well as the emphasis 
of others? Or do all facts have much the same value, so that they 
should receive about equal attention, as is the case with the 
multiplication table? And, instead of being grouped according 
to relations and relative values, should they be studied, one at a 
time, in the order in which they are presented, with the idea
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE NATURE OF STUDY 27 
that a topic is mastered when each single statement upon it is 
understood? Or, if not this, has the reliable author at least 
already attended to this whole matter, making the various rela- 
tions of facts to one another and their relative values so clear 
that the student has little work to do but to follow the printed 
statement? Is it even highly unsafe for the latter to assume the 
responsibility of judging relative values? And would the neglect 
or skipping of many supposedly little things be more likely to 
result in careless, slipshod work than in thoroughness? 
(4) The judging of the worth of statements as a fourth factor 
in study 
The scientist in charge of the above-mentioned investigation 
was, no doubt, a modest man. Yet he saw fit to question the old 
assumption that yellow fever was spread by invisible particles 
called “fomites.” Indeed, he had the boldness to disprove it. 
Then he disproved, also, the assumption that the fever was con- 
tagious by contact. After that he set out to test a hypothesis of 
his own. His attitude toward the results of former investiga- 
tions was thus skeptically critical, Every proposition was to be 
questioned, and the evidence of facts, rather than personal au- 
thority or the authority of time, was the sole final test of validity. 
What should be the attitude of the young student toward the 
authorities that he studies? Certainly authors are, as a rule, more 
mature and far better informed upon the subjects they discuss 
than he; otherwise he would not be pursuing them. Are they 
still so prone to error that he should be critical toward them? 
At any rate, should he set himself up as their judge, at times 
condemning some of their statements outright, or accepting them 
only in part—and thus maintain independent views? Or would 
that be the height of presumption on his part? While it is true 
that all authors are liable to error, are they much less liable to 
it in their chosen fields than he, and can he more safely trust 
them than himself? And should he, therefore, being a learner, 
adopt a docile, passive attitude, and accept whatever statements
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
are presented? Or finally, is neither of these attitudes correct? 
Instead of either condemning or accepting authors, is it his duty 
merely to understand and remember what they say? 
(5) Memorizing as a fifth factor in study 
The scientist is greatly dependent upon his memory. So is 
everyone else, including the young student. What suggestions, 
if any, can i made about the retaining of facts? 
In particular, how prominent in study should be the effort to 
memorize? Should memorizing constitute the main part of 
study—as it so often does—or only a minor part? It is often 
contrasted with thinking. Is such a contrast justified? If so, 
should the effort to memorize usually precede the thinking—as 
is often the order in learning poetry and Bible verses—or should 
it follow the thinking? And why? Can one greatly strengthen 
the memory by special exercises for that purpose? Finally, 
since there are some astonishingly poor ways of memorizing, 
there must . some better ways. What, then, are the best, 
and why? 
(6) The using of ideas as a sixth factor in study 
Does all knowledge, like this of the scientist, require contact 
with the world as its end-point, or goal? And is it the duty 
of the student to pursue any topic, whether it be a principle of 
physics, or a moral idea, or a simple story, until it proves of 
benefit to someone? In that case, enough repetition might be 
necessary to approximate habits—habits of mind and habits 
of action—for the skill necessary for the successful use of some 
knowledge cot otherwise be attained. How, then, can habits 
become best established? Or is knowledge something apart from 
the active world, ending rather in self? Would it be narrowly 
foolish to expect that one’s learning shall necessarily work 
out in eas life? And should the student rather rest: con- 
tent to acquire knowledge for its own sake, not bothering—for 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
THE NATURE OF STUDY 29 
the present, at any rate—about actually bringing it to account 
in any way? 
The use to which his ideas had to be put gave Dr. Reed an 
excellent test of their reliability. No doubt he passed through 
many stages of doubt as he investigated one theory after another. 
And he could not feel reasonably sure that he was right .and had 
mastered his problem until his final hypothesis had been shown 
to hold good under varying actual conditions. 
What test has the ordinary student for knowing when he 
knows a thing well enough to leave it? He may set up specific 
purposes to be accomplished, as has been suggested. Yet even 
these may be only ideas; what means has he for knowing when 
they have been attained? It is a long distance from the first ap- 
proach to an important thought to its final mastery, and nothing 
is easier than to stop too soon. If there are any waymarks along 
the road, indicating the different stages reached—particularly, 
if there is a recognizable end-point assuring mastery, one might 
avoid many dangerous headers by knowing the fact. Or is that 
particularly what recitations and marks are for? And instead of 
expecting an independent way of determining when he has mas- 
tered a subject, should the student simply rely upon his teacher 
to acquaint him with that fact? 
(7) The tentative attitude as a seventh factor in study 
Investigators of the source of yellow fever before Dr. Reed 
reached conclusions as well as he, but, in the light of later dis- 
covery, they appear hasty and foolish, to the extent that they 
were insisted upon as correct. A large percentage of the so- 
ealled discoveries that are made, even by laboratory experiment, 
are later disproved. Even in regard to this very valuable work 
of Dr. Reed and his associates, one may feel too sure. It is quite 
possible that future study will materially supplement and modify 
our present knowledge of the subject. The scientist, therefore, 
may well assume an attitude of doubt toward all the results that © 
he achieves.

30 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
Does the same hold for the young student? Is all our knowl- 
edge more or less doubtful, so that we should hold ourselves 
ready to modify our ideas at any time? And, remembering the 
common tendency to become unprogressive on that account, 
should the young student, in particular, regard some degree of 
uncertainty about his facts as the ideal state of mind for him 
to reach? i would such uncertainty too easily undermine his 
self-confidence and render him vacillating in action? And should 
firmly fixed ideas, rather than those that are somewhat uncer- 
tain, be regarded as his goal, so that the extent to which he feels 
sure of his knowledge may be taken as one measure of his prog- 
ress? Or can it be that there are two kinds of knowledge? 
That some facts are true for all time, and can be learned as abso- 
lutely true; and that others are only probabilities and must be 
treated as such? In that case, which is of the former kind, and 
which is. of te latter ? 
SOME LIMITATIONS OF THE TERM STUDY 
Study, in general, is the work that is necessary in the assimila- 
tion of ideas. Much of this work consists in thinking. But 
study is not synonymous with thinking, for it also includes other 
activities, as mechanical drill, for example. Such drill is often 
necessary in the mastery of thought. 
Not just any thinking and any drill, however, may be counted 
as study. At least only such thinking and such drill are here 
included within the term as are integral parts of the mental 
work that is necessary in the accomplishment of valuable pur- 
poses. Thinking that is done at random, and drills that have no 
object beyond acquaintance with dead facts, as those upon dates, 
lists of ok and location of places, for instance, are unworthy 
of being considered a part of study. 
Daydreaning giving way to reverie and to casual fancy, too, 
is not to be regarded as study. Not because it is not well to 
indulge in such activity at times, but because it is not serious 
enough to be called work. Study is systematic work, and not 
     
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE NATURE OF STUDY 31 
play. Reading for recreation, further, is not study. It is cer- 
tainly very desirable and even necessary, just as play is. It even 
partakes of many of the characteristics of true study, and reaps 
many of its benefits. No doubt, too, the extensive reading that 
children and youths now do might well partake more fully of the 
nature of study. It would result in more good and less harm; 
for, beyond a doubt, much careless reading is injurious to habits 
of serious study. Yet it would be intolerable to attempt to con- 
vert pleasure-reading fully into real study. That would mean 
that we had become too serious. 
On the whole, then, the term study as here used has largely 
the meaning that is given to it in ordinary speech. Yet it is not 
entirely the same; the term signifies a purposive and systematic, 
and therefore a more limited, kind of work than much that goes 
under that name.

each pupil try to make a contribution. What part of MeMurry’s 
article suggested your contribution? 
2. Preparation for an informal test. Turn back as often as you 
please to McMurry’s article. Prepare for class discussion by getting 
ready to explain, with references to his account of the yellow-fever 
investigations, the meaning of each of these statements and questions: 
(a) The purposes of study arise out of needs, wants, diffi- 
culties, dangers. 
(b) A good student often supplements the thought of others. 
(c) Good study recognizes a few facts as “having supreme 
importance.” 
(da) “Judging the worth of statements” is a fourth factor in 
study. 
(e) What questions does MeMurry raise about the relation of 
remembering to study?

  32 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
(f) Constantly attempting to think of applications and uses 
is the crowning step of study. 
(g) The truth is always growing; an effective student holds 
his mind in readiness for new truth. 
3. Illustrate the seven points again, this time from your own expe- 
riences, reading, conversations, and observations, in one of these fields: 
(a) Your study of sanitation or of some kindred subject in 
your science classes. 
(b) Your study of immigration or of some kindred subject in 
civies, or community life. 
(c) Your study of the value of physical training or inter- 
school athletics. 
(d@) Your study of student self-government as a factor in 
school life. 
(e) Your study in American history of the founding of our 
nation. 
Individual Problems 
Prepare a brief oral or written report upon one of the following 
problems. 
1. Why is the study of lessons in school far less fascinating to some 
students than the study of a gasoline engine, of a wireless appa- 
ratus, of violin or piano? Answer this in the light of MeMurry’s first 
point (pages 21-22). 
2. In order to explain to the class MeMurry’s reference on page 23, 
read Lamb’s “Essay on Roast Pig.” (It is in Greenlaw, Elson, 
and Keck’s seeeve and Life, Book One, page 17.) 
3. Get references on the conquering of yellow fever by Dr. Reed and 
associates. (See Uncle Sam’s Modern Miracles, W. A. Du Puy, Chapter 
XVII, “Yellow Fever.”) Read and report to the class. Use an ercyclo- 
pedia to find the theory of “fomites,” one of the earlier hypotheses con- 
cerning the cause of yellow fever, mentioned on page 27. 
4. “A good author leaves much of the work for the student to do.” 
We shall consider this truth extensively in a later chapter. Can you 
explain the point now by citing several examples from your own study? 
5. “Thorough study requires the neglect of some things.” Of course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE NATURE OF STUDY 33 
this refers to relatively unimportant items or parts of a subject you 
are studying. Try to illustrate this point from your study in any of 
your courses. What details can you afford to neglect? 
6. “Daydreaming instead of study.” Do you ever have the shock 
of suddenly waking to the realization that you have read several pages, 
and yet your mind is an utter blank so far as that reading is concerned? 
Describe such an experience. Which of McMurry’s principles did you 
violate? 
7. Many cases in which reflective thinking is employed arise out of 
the existence of some need, some felt want, some real or supposed injus- 
tice or inequality in existing affairs. A statement of this fact is given 
in MeMurry’s first paragraphs, in his reference to the Eskimo. With 
this in mind, carry out these problems: 
(a) To the list suggested below, add topics in which reflective think- 
ing begins with a clear statement of a felt need; fill in the blank lines 
with questions and topics of local significance. In each ease explain 
what “need” is the starting point of discussion. 
School 
(i) Shall we support a school paper? 
(ii) Shall we add a new department to the school paper? 
(iii) Modifications in the system of monthly reports. 
(iv) The value of a course that deals directly with the nature of 
study habits. 
Recreation 
(i) Shall our city have public playgrounds? 
(ii) Removing all signs “Keep off the grass.” 
(iii) Should we have compulsory physical training? 
Government 
(i) A large vs. a small city council. 
(ii) A new fire station in Ward 9?

(b) Name other problems for thinking which arise out of needs or 
wants: in the field of city improvement; of good roads in the country; 
of speed limits|for automobiles; of public playgrounds and bathing 
beaches in the city; of adequate school buildings. 
(c) What problems involving difference of opinion have arisen in 
your school during the past year? When you have named two or three, 
try to trace each back to either the actual or the imagined needs which 
lie at their roots. 
8. Refleetive thinking is by no means limited to questions upon which 
there is actual controversy, although differences in opinion are fruitful 
in arousing such thinking. Try to name situations in your school life 
which eall for reflection, although they may not have called forth any 
debate. Name examples for reflective thinking especially in your litera- 
ture classes, in your history or science classes. Be ready to explain 
the point in this paragraph in terms of the example you select. 
9. McMurry emphasizes the fact that much reflective thinking pro- 
duces some social value; witness the devoted work of Dr. Reed and his 
associates. Have you ever enjoyed a play or a book so heartily that 
you immediately endeavored to persuade your friends to see or to read 
it? Explain to the class how you proceeded in your persuasion. Sug- 
gest other social values which have come from refiective thinking. 
10. Be able to name the seven factors of study and to explain the 
meaning of each.

Reading Suggestions 
The following selection presents abundant evidence showing that 
good scholarship is a reliable ground for predicting suecess. The 
artiele furnishes excellent laboratory material for practicing several 
features of efficient study. Plan to carry out, preferably in the class- 
room, all trying together, the features of efficient study here named. 
Complete each step in order before you begin the next. 
(1) Secure bodily comfort. Sit comfortably erect with the light 
falling evenly on your page, holding the book at an easy angle and 
correct distance. Be comfortable, but not too comfortable. A reader 
settles back in a cushioned rocking-chair when he is reading an inter- 
esting story and never thinks of becoming sleepy. But when he has 
in hand a book that requires earnest study, he must not allow his body 
to be too comfortable. And yet, for efficient work, the body must not 
be positively uncomfortable. The principle is that for effective study 
the body must not make its presence felt at all. 
(2) Determine a purpose. Read the title. Think about it. The 
answer to the question “Should Students Study?” is obvious; but you 
should be curious to know how the author proves that it pays to study. 
What would you like to have this article answer for you? If you can- 
not immediately name a purpose for reading, look slowly through 
Foster’s first three paragraphs; think of your own achievements, your 
weaknesses, your ambitions. Can you think of a possible use you

  36 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
could make of proof that it pays to study? If so, your purpose in 
reading is at hand. ps 
(3) Secure a bird’s-eye view of the entire article. Now glance 
rapidly through the entire selection to secure a bird’s-eye view of Mr. 
Foster’s ok make use of the various headings in the text to 
note the leading divisions and subdivisions of his thinking, and their 
relations to each other. Notice particularly that the first major divi- 
sion deals with scholarship in the high school, the second, with scholar- 
ship in college, the third with the professional school, and the last with 
ultimate success in life. 
(4) Select inportont parts. After your preliminary examination, 
check back over the article and pick out certain passages which seem 
to you most significant. Remember where they occur in order that you 
may consider them more intently during your second reading. 
(5) Study selected parts intensively. Reread the entire article 
slowly, giving special consideration to the passages which contain the 
most vital data. If possible, relate the substance of these passages to 
experiences of your own, supporting or contradicting Mr. Foster’s 
argument. 
(6) Recall the essentials and repeat them to yourself. Close your 
book. Ask yourself “Should Students Study?” Recall Mr. Foster’s 
main line of argument and some significant data for each division. 
(7) Make a final summary of the meaning. Give without reference 
to the book, after your final reading: 
(a) The strongest piece of evidence presented to the effect that 
high rank in the high school means high rank in college. 
(b) The strongest evidence that high scholarship in college 
means achievement in the graduate school. 
(c) The strongest data that scholarship in school means dis- 
tinguished success in life. 
Complete each of the seven steps of study one at a time. So far as 
possible finish each before you attempt the next. 
Is high scholarship worth the effort? In other words, is there 
any evidence that a student who attains high marks is more 
likely to achieve success after graduation than a student who is 
content with passing marks?

I.! HIGH-SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIP AND SUCCESS IN COLLEGE 
Are good students in high school more likely than others to 
become good students in college? 
(1) Professor Walter F. Dearborn tried to answer that ques- 
tion for the State of Wisconsin. He compared the records of 
hundreds of students at the University of Wisconsin with their 
records in various high schools. He found that above 80 
per cent of those who were in the first quarter of their high- 
school classes remained in the upper half of their classes through- 
out the four years of their university course, and that above 
80 per cent of those who were in the lowest quarter of their 
high-school classes failed to rise above the line of mediocre 
scholarship in the University. The parallelism is so striking 
that we are justified in concluding that, except in scattering 
cases, promise in the high school becomes performance in the 
college. Indeed, only one student out of nearly five hundred in 
this investigation who fell among the lowest quarter in the high 
school attained the highest rank in the University. Of course, 
a boy may loaf in high school and take his chance of being the 
one exception among five hundred. But he would hardly be 
taking a sporting chance; it would be rather a fool’s chance. 
The risk would be less in going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. 
(2) The University of Chicago found that high-school stu- 
dents who failed to attain an average rank higher than the pass- 
ing mark, by at least 25 per cent of the difference between that 
passing mark and 100, failed in their college classes. The fac- 
ulty therefore decided not to admit such students. Exceptions 
were made of the most meritorious cases, but few of these ex- 
ceptions made satisfactory records in the University. 
(3) Basing its policy upon such evidence as this, Reed College, 
of Portland, Oregon, decided to admit, as a rule, only students 
who ranked in the first third of their preparatory-school classes. 
  
The numbers, placed in the text by the author’s permission, are inserted for the convenience of students in their laboratory work.

   THE NATURE OF STUDY 
Some exceptions were made. Twenty per cent of those admitted 
were known to be below the first third, and 2 per cent below the 
median line.1’ In all cases these candidates were regarded as 
the most promising of those who fell below the first third in 
high-school rank, yet almost without exception they failed to 
rise above the lowest quarter of their college classes. Thus, it 
appears that in Oregon, as in Wisconsin and Illinois, those who 
get the best start in the lower schools maintain their advantage 
in the upper schools; few of their classmates overtake them. 
Ul. COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP AND SUCCESS IN PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS 
But why strive for high rank in college? Why not wait for 
the more “practical” studies of the professional school? Hun- 
dreds of boys the country over declare today that it makes little 
difference whether they win high grades or merely passable 
grades in studies that are cultural rather than practical, since 
these courses have no definite bearing on their intended life- 
work. Almost invariably they are ready to admit that they 
to serious effort in the studies of law, medicine, 
engineering—that is to say, in professional schools. Even the 
sport who makes the grade of mediocrity his highest aim as a 
college undergraduate fully intends to strive for high scholar- 
ship in his professional studies. Does he often attain that aim? 
That is the question. 
(1) And that, fortunately, is a question we may answer with 
more than opinions. We may take, for example, all the students 
who graduated from Harvard College during a period of twelve 
years and entered the Harvard Medical School. Of the 239 who 
received no distinction as undergraduates, 36 per cent graduated 
with honor from the Medical School. Of the 41 who received 
degrees of A.B. with high honor, more than 92 per cent took 
their medical degrees with honor. 
(2) Still more conclusive are the records of the graduates of 
      
1Jn the lower half of their high-school classes, in scholarship.
-P-A-G-E-39
  SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY? 39 
Harvard College who during a period of twenty years entered 
the Harvard Law School. Of those who graduated from college 
with no special honor, only 6% per cent attained distinction in 
the Law School. Of those who graduated with honor from the 
college, 22 per cent attained distinction in the Law School; of 
those graduated with great honor, 40 per cent; and of those 
who graduated with highest honor, 60 per cent. Sixty per cent! 
Bear that figure in mind a moment, while we consider the 340 
who entered college “with conditions’”—that is to say, without 
having passed all their entrance examinations—and left college 
with plain degrees. Of these men, not 3 per cent won honor 
degrees in law. 
If a college undergraduate is ready to be honest with him- 
self, he must say, “If I am content with mediocre work in 
college, it is likely that the men in my class who are graduated 
with honor will have three times my chances of success in the 
Law School, and the men in my class with highest honor will 
have nearly ten times my chances of success.” So difficult is it 
for a student to change his habits of life after the crucial years 
of college that not one man in twenty years—not one man in 
twenty years—who was satisfied in Harvard College with grades 
of “C” and lower gained distinction in the studies of the Har- 
vard Law School. 
(3) The same relation appears to persist between the promise 
of Yale undergraduates and their performance in the Harvard 
Law School. If we divide the 250 graduates of Yale who re- 
ceived their degrees in law at Cambridge! between 1900 and 1915 
into nine groups, according to undergraduate scholarship, begin- 
ning with those who won the highest “Senior Appointments” at 
Yale and ending with those who received no graduation honors, 
we find that the first group did the best work in their studies of 
law, the second group next, the third group next, and so on, in 
the same order, with but a single exception, to the bottom of the 
  
10ambridge, Massachusetts, is the seat of Harvard University. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
list. The performance at Harvard of each of the eight groups 
of Yale honor graduates was in precise accordance with the 
promise of their records at Yale. 
Apparently the “good fellow” in college, the sport who does 
not let his studies interfere with his education, but who intends 
to settle down to hard work later on, and who later on actually 
does completely change his habits of life, is almost a myth. At 
least his roo does not appear among those of thousands of 
students whose careers have been investigated under the direc- 
tion of President Lowell' and others. It seems that results are 
legal tender, but you cannot cash in good intentions. 
“Dignified credit to all,” cries the billboard. “Enjoy your 
new suit now, and pay for it later.” Many a boy, lured by the 
installment plan, expects to get an education on deferred pay- 
ments in effort, only to find that there is no credit for him, 
dignified or otherwise. What his honest effort has paid for in 
full is his today; nothing more by any chance whatever. 
Ill. PROFESSIONAL-SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIP AND SUCCESS IN LIFE 
Let us pursue the inquiry one step further. Let us ask whether 
success in studies gives promise of success in life. As far as the 
study of law is concerned, we may answer at once that the known 
success of De Asia graduates of the Harvard Law School is one 
reason why even college undergraduates at Cambridge believe 
that law students should study law—hard and seriously. For 
the same reason, leading law-offices the country over give pref- 
erence to honor graduates of law schools. 
(1) As one measure of success in life, we may take the judg- 
ment of certain men. In so far as we accept their judgment, our 
findings concerning the relation between college studies and this 
kind of suceess will seem important to us. Here, as in most 
questions of educational aim, we can do no better for the present 
than take the consensus of opinion of competent judges. 
Using this measure for success, I endeavored to find out 
  
1President A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard University. 
   
-P-A-G-E-41
  
SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY? 41 
whether the members of the class of 1894 of Harvard College 
who had become notable in their lifework had been notable in 
their studies. I therefore asked three judges to select, independ- 
ently, the most successful men from that class. I chose as judges 
the Dean of the college, the secretary of the Alumni Association, 
and a professor in Columbia University who is a member of the 
class, because I thought that these men came nearer than any 
others to knowing all members of the class. I left each judge 
free to use his own definition of success, but I asked them not to 
select men whose achievements appeared to be due principally 
to family wealth or position. The judges agreed in naming 
twenty-three successful men. I then had the entire undergrad- 
uate records of these men accurately copied from the college 
records and compared with the standing of twenty-three men. 
chosen at random from the same class. 
The result was striking. The men who were thus named as 
most successful attained in their college studies nearly four 
times as many highest grades as the random selection. To the 
eredit of the successful men are 196 “‘A’s”; to the credit of the 
other men, only 56, 
(2) Following a similar plan, three judges selected the most 
successful men among the graduates of the first twenty-four 
(1878-1901) classes from the University of Oregon. An exam- 
ination of the scholarship records of these men showed that 53 
per cent had been good students and 17 per cent had been weak 
students. Of the graduates who were not regarded as success- 
ful, 52 per cent had been weak students and only 12 per cent 
had been good students. 
(3) Similar results have been found by Dean A. A. Potter, 
of the Kansas State Agricultural College, in an unpublished 
study of the relationship between superiority in undergraduate 
scholarship and success in the practice of engineering as indi- 
eated by salaries received. The Director of the School of 
Forestry of Yale University has collected evidence of the same 
kind in an unpublished study of the graduates of the Yale School 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
of Forestry. It appears that about 90 per cent of the men 
who have had conspicuous success in the field of forestry were 
among the better students in their professional studies. Presi- 
dent Thwing of Western Reserve University, the historian of 
higher education in America, says that he has found no excep- 
tion, in the records of any American college, to the general rule 
that those who achieve most before graduation are likely to 
achieve most after graduation. 
(4) The list of the first ten scholars of each of the classes that 
graduated from Harvard College in the sixth decade of the last 
century, as presented by William Roscoe Thayer, is a list of men 
eminent in every walk of life. Indeed, it is likely that the first 
quarter in scholarship of any school or college class will give to 
the world as many distinguished men as the other three-quarters, 
(5) What can we say in this connection of the 420 living 
graduates of the ten Wesleyan University classes from 1890 to 
1899? Just this: Of the men in that group who graduated with 
highest honors, 60 per cent are now regarded as distinguished 
either by Who's Who in America’ or by the judgment of their 
classmates ; of those who were elected to Phi Beta Kappa—the 
scholarship honor society—30 per cent; of those who won no 
superior honors in scholarship, only 11 per cent. Of the men 
now living who graduated from Wesleyan University between 
1860 and 1889, 10 per cent are listed in Who’s Who; of those 
who received high honors in scholarship during this period, 50 
per cent; of those who attained no distinction as scholars, only 
10 per cent. 
From the records of 1667 graduates of Wesleyan University, 
Professor Nicholson concludes that of the highest-honor grad- 
uates (the two or three leading scholars of each class) one out 
of two will become distinguished; of Phi Beta Kappa men, one 
out of three; of the rest, one out of ten. 
(6) Further proof of the relation between scholarship and

tionary of Notable Living Men and Women of the United States. 
   
-P-A-G-E-43
  SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY? 43 
success in life was found by Professor E. G. Dexter. He com- 
pared the records, before and after graduation, of the men of 
twenty-two colleges. Of all the living graduates of these col- 
leges, he found about 2 per cent in Who’s Who; of the honor 
scholars, he found 5.9 per cent. It thus appears that the 
chances of this kind of success in life of a good student are about 
three times the chances of students selected at random. Looking 
at the records in still another way, we may observe that about 
15 per cent of all graduates are Phi Beta Kappa men. If rank 
in college has nothing to do with success in life, we should expect 
to find that 15 per cent of the graduates in Who’s Who were 
Phi Beta Kappa men. But they surpass this expectancy by 
nearly 100 per cent. 
Iv. ULTIMATE GOALS 
In much that I have said about suceess I have used the mathe- 
matical term “chance,” a term as far removed as any term could 
be from the popular notion of luck. If all these studies prove 
anything, they prove that there is a long chain of causal connec: 
tions binding together the achievements of a man’s life and 
explaining the suecess of a given moment. That is the non-skid 
chain that keeps him safe in slippery places. Luck is about as 
likely to strike a man as lightning, and about as likely to do him 
any good. The best luck a young man can have is the firm 
conviction that there is no such thing as luck, and that he will 
gain in life just about what he deserves, and no more. The man 
who is waiting around for something lucky to turn up has time 
to see a preparedness parade pass by him—the procession of 
those who have formed the habit of turning things up. In a 
bar-room at a prairie station in the West I once saw the sign, 
“Luck beats science every time.” That is the motto of the 
gambler. But all men who have won durable distinction are 
proof that science beats luck—science operating through the 
laws of heredity and habit. 
The student who is really eager to excel in any lifework, and   
 
-P-A-G-E-44

who is brave enough to face the facts, will take down that sign

life interfere with your life’s ambition.” The one

CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Problems and Topics for Investigation 
From among these or other lines of inquiry suggested by them, choose 
topics for written or oral discussion as the teacher directs, or as directed 
by a oT of the class appointed for the purpose. 
1. Can you, 
of evidence without turning back, give the essence of the three lines 
cited by Foster to prove that excellent scholarship in the 
high school means excellent scholarship in college? Write from memory.

Perhaps you can work out through class discussion some tests for 
strong evidence of this order. List them on the blackboard. 
3. Find and quote the data from Foster’s article which best support 
the followi 
from 1869 ig statement of Charles W. Eliot, President of Harvard 
1909. He once spoke to the freshman elass of the mark

    6. Apply this idea to Foster’s article: The field of thought is like afi 
irregular surface, with heights or peaks scattered over it. As moun- 
tains rest upon the lower lands about them, the larger ideas are sup- 
ported by the details that relate to them. 
What mountain peaks stand out in Foster’s thinking? 
Name some of the clusters of foothills. Are there portions that might 
be likened to lower lands upon which the elevations rest? 
7. An article, “Tests for Ability before College,” by J. B. Johnson, 
in School and Society, Vol. 15, gives further data supporting one 
of Foster’s contentions. Imagine that you are Mr. Foster; find a place 
in the article to make an insert; using the following data, write a 
paragraph that might appropriately be inserted at the place chosen. 
A student is considered to have a low record in the high school if he 
stood in the lowest one-fourth of his class. If the University of Minne- 
sota had said in 1921 that students with a low record in their high- 
school work eould not be expected to succeed in college, 66 out of 148 
failures in the freshman work of that year would have been indicated 
at the beginning instead of at the end of the year. The actual stand- 
ing in the freshman year of college of those who were low in their high- 
school marks is indicated as follows: 
Rank in High School Record in College 
Failure Condition Low Poor 
F D C- Cc 
Lowest 25 per cent 64 6 8 3 
Lowest 10 per cent 28 5 1 1 
It is evident that high-school performance largely indicates what 
college performance will be. 
8. By comparing the selections of MeMurry and of Foster, attempt 
to arrive at a distinction in your own thinking between an “investiga- 
itor” like Dr. Reed, and an “advocate” like Mr. Foster.

HOW TO STUDY? 
Francis C. Lockwoop 
Reading Suggestions 
The selection in this section was written for students just entering 
upon their freshman year in college. It is therefore quite different in 
nature from the chapter of MeMurry who wrote for more experienced 
students, and from that of Foster who wrote for a general audience of 
magazine readers. The audience for whom an article is prepared 
always has a direct effect upon both the purpose and the substance 
which a writer employs. Note the following differences. 
(1) Foster’s “Should Students Study?” is bristling with faets and 
figures which all bear directly upon one central compact theme. 
MeMurry’s “The Nature of Study” is based upon facts which he does 
not minutely report. He contents himself with general truths about 
scientific experiments and indicates the bearings of these experiments 
upon the factors of study. In the article you are about to read, Lock- 
wood also bases his thinking upon facts; but he does not assemble 
facts as Foster does, nor does he refer to facts which are outside his 
reader’s personal experience as McMurry does. Instead, Lockwood 
refers to a wide range of facts which lie within the experience of his 
readers; he does not name them all. 
(2) A second difference lies in the breadth of the central ideas. 
Foster has one very definite and narrow theme: scholarship pays. 
MeMurry’s discussion covers several elements of a larger but still rela- 
tively narrow theme, the factors of study. Lockwood has a much 
more inclusive theme. 
In your first reading determine which of the four major lines of 
thought in Lockwood you will examine intensively in your second 
reading.

   THE NATURE OF STUDY 
I 
What are the real aims of study? The object of study is, in 
the first place, to get fast and firm possession of facts—facts of 
spelling, reading, mathematics, composition, history, language, 
geography, and the like. It is highly desirable that we should 
know how to spell Chicago and business; Boston and brains; and 
that we should know for all time. We want to know once for all 
that seven times nine are sixty-three; that Abraham Lincoln 
signed the Emancipation Proclamation; that an island is a body 
of land completely surrounded by water; and that a proper name 
should begin with a capital letter. Many, many, minute facts, as 
well as certain connected bodies of truth, should be embedded in 
one’s memory as deeply and securely as a bullet that has lodged 
in the heart of a growing tree. And one should master certain 
processes of thought, and grip a few great underlying and 
unchanging principles of life and conduct. 
Yet the chief value of study does not lie in the stowing away 
of facts and principles. You study for discipline. You study 
in order that you may become a student, just as you exercise, 
not for recreation alone, but that you may become an athlete. In 
making yourself a student you are making yourself fit for the 
fierce intellectual encounters of middle life. No time for train- 
ing then! And woe to him whose brain-fiber is flabby then, 
whose mental processes are slow and hazy and uncertain! Your 
mind must work with the force and steadiness of a piston-rod; 
must clutch like a vise. You will be pitted against antagonists 
worthy of your mettle. They will not sleep; nor will they let 
you sleep during the long day of strain in the court-room, on the 
stump, in the halls of legislation, at the editorial desk, in the 
counting-house, where the tides of traffic run full and hot, and 
where masters of finance and captains of industry sit secretly, 
silently, astutely making or marring your fortunes or the for-
-P-A-G-E-49

tunes of weak men and women whose champion you are. It may 
be that with knife or drug you will suddenly be set in the 
lonely night to hold Death at bay in some terrified home, or on 
some tragic highway or byway. You are winning these crucial 
contests now by the precision and the promptness and the thor- 
oughness that you are working into your higher nerve centers; 
by the severe training that you are giving yourself in attention, 
decision, mental alertness, and moral control. 
Again, it is worth while to study because there is nothing in 
the world so glorious as truth, nothing so fascinating as the pur- 
suit of wisdom. Mind alone can unlock the meaning of the world: 
If we would be free we must think ourselves free. To the degree 
that we are ignorant we are slaves—slaves to wind and wave, to 
time and tide, to sin and pain, to man and devil and microbe. 
But to the extent that we study and think and gain wisdom, we 
drive back the barriers of darkness and come into the full free- 
dom of our own free spirits. There is in us a divine curiosity 
that urges us to perpetual inquiry. We are set in this world to 
solve riddles. We study because there burns within us an 
unquenched and unquenchable passion to uncover reality; to 
drive out the bogies and the fetishes and the hoodoos that lurk in 
this human wilderness through which we are traveling. Study 
purifies and exalts the student. It loosens the bonds of Time and 
Space. Study enthrones a man with the gods. Through study 
we may escape into the infinite and the eternal; we may unite 
ourselves with God.

Study consists in focusing the mind upon the subject in hand. 
In very early life we have almost no power of voluntary atten- 
tion; and even the mature scholar can hold his mind on a given 
object only for an instant by his own will power. The little child 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
scarcely has any mind that he can call his own. He lives out of 
doors, on the open highways of sensation. His mind is snatched 
hither and thither by the bright baubles and the entrancing 
sounds around him. He surrenders himself completely and on 
the spot to the last and gaudiest attraction that bids for his 
attention. We laugh at professors and philosophers for being 
absent-minded. In reality they are not absent-minded at all; 
they are so present-minded that they are utterly oblivious of 
their bodies and of everything around them. They have learned 
the art of study, and are giving attention mightily. 
With children—and with many college students—it is exactly 
the opposite. Their bodies are chained to the tasks before them, 
but their minds are absent on other and more attractive pur- 
suits. Now the trouble with many students is that they are still 
children. They have never learned how to hold their attention 
closely and sternly to a set task. They are given to dawdling 
and to idle daydreaming. They are at the mercy of every sen- 
sation and every enticement. An educated person learns “to do 
the thing he does not want to do, at the time he does not want 
to do it.” 
In the long run the secret of study resides in our ability to 
bathe our thought, our task, our lesson in the stream of interest. 
The way to study successfully and joyously is to be interested in 
the thing that claims our attention. It is not hard to interest a 
boy in a dog, or a gun, or a swimming-hole. Dress and travel 
and baseball and automobiles and dinner-parties interest every- 
one. But how remote these things all seem from the stupid rules 
and theorems and outlines and repellent facts that we find star- 
ing at us from our textbooks, and forever tripping us up in the 
classroom ! 
Yet, in reality, these two realms are not altogether removed 
from each other. There are connecting threads, if only we can 
find them. We must learn to carry over from the things that 
we do like, or the things that we are absorbed in, fragments 
or filaments of interest which may be attached to the dull or
-P-A-G-E-51
  HOW TO STUDY 51 
hated study that we must master. Of course the surest and most 
natural way to bring this about is to live such an alert, wide- 
awake, and sympathetic life that the world speaks our language 
at whatever point we accost it. It is well to have sensations 
and experiences and some slight information, at least, stored up 
from many sources. The greater our store of facts, images, 
experiences, and associations from the past, the more likely we 
are to find some point of contact between a new subject and an 
old one, and so to transfer interest from one to the other. 
If a subject seems hopelessly dry, one may approach it in some 
such way as this: It has interested other men; why should I be 
a stranger to it? Or, let one say to oneself: This subject, what- 
ever its attractiveness or lack of attractiveness, is the sort of 
thing that comes to life out there in the world—the sort of thing 
that men are stumbling over on every human highway. What I 
study now is related to what I am going to do hereafter. Some- 
where, sometime, in a moment of doubt, or need, or loneliness, 
or crisis, this little, hard, unattractive, apparently insignificant 
scrap of fact, bit of quotation, or statement of principle may 
saunter obligingly into my mind at need, and prove as welcome 
to me as would a comrade or a brother. 4 
One may study with the thought of future travel. “He that 
would bring home the wealth of the Indies must carry out the 
wealth of the Indies.” That is, we shall see only what we are 
prepared to see. Study with the thought of making yourself an 
int. resting and resourceful conversationalist. Study, again, for 
the rewards of scholarship; or if this is no incentive, study in 
order to win honor for your “bunch,” your fraternity, your 
family, your country. 
And study, finally, if no other interest serves, because you are 
aman. It is nonsense to suppose that every step in education can 
be interesting. The fighting impulse must often be appealed to. 
Be ashamed of being scared at fractions, of being downed by the 
law of falling bodies; rouse your pugnacity and pride, and you 
will rush at the difficult places with a sort of inner wrath at
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
yourself that is one of your best moral faculties. A victory 
scored under such conditions becomes a turning-point and a 
erisis of your character. It represents the high-water mark of 
your powers, and serves thereafter as an ideal pattern for your 
self-imitation. 
III 
Bodily conditions largely affect mental activity. There is 
no teamwork so essential as the teamwork between brain and 
thought. The soil in which thought is nourished is the fine gray 
nerve-matter of the brain. The intellectual harvest from this 
brain-soil will depend upon two things—the original and inher- 
ited vigor of the nerve-cells of the brain, and the quantity and 
quality of the blood with which they are supplied. The delicate 
gray nerve-matter of the brain requires much good blood. 
Indeed, the brain is not unlike a great sponge, and the harder 
one studies the more plentifully it must be saturated with pure, 
rich blood. Like any other physical organ, the brain becomes 
exhausted after long-continued mental effort, and must have rest 
in order to regain its vitality. Prolonged hard thinking tears 
down and wears away the brain tissue. This waste matter, like 
a charred lamp wick that retards the free supply of oil to the 
flame, must be carried off and replaced by fresh material. 
Sleep and exercise are the best means of working this change 
in the tired brain. And, always, much fresh air is required for 
this renewal. The mind is freshest and best fitted for hard work 
in the morning ; so the severest tasks should be taken up as early 
in the day as possible. It is not a good thing, though, to study 
long and hard in the early morning before eating. On the other 
hand, it is poor policy to study late into the night; first, because 
the blood supply in the brain is then so charged with the products 
of decomposition, due to the wear and tear of the body during 
the activities of the day, that the mind cannot get clear.and firm 
impressions; and, second, because the undue amount of blood 
that has been called to the brain tends to drive sleep away even
-P-A-G-E-53
  
HOW TO STUDY 53 
after one quits work. Each student should study his own case 
carefully and find out when and how he can do the best work. 
Nor is it wise to study soon after a hearty meal. Since the 
digestive organs are heavily taxed at this time, they summon a 
large supply of blood from the brain and the other parts of the 
body. And, since there cannot be a proper supply of blood in 
both places at the same time, either the digestive organs will be 
robbed of their supply, with the result that digestion cannot be 
carried on properly, or the brain will be so impoverished that it 
must of necessity do poor work. For this reason, too, mealtime 
should be an oceasion for leisurely conversation and good-fellow- 
ship; and for the same reason the time for at least a half-hour 
after a heavy meal should be spent either in the enjoyment of a 
short nap, or with music or light reading, or in some form of 
agreeable and easy physical exercise. The serious student will 
think out carefully a daily program of study and then adhere 
to it as closely as he can without doing violence to common sense. 
Use your eyes with care. Do not strain them in the twilight, 
or use them when the artificial light is bad. Do not sit with 
your face to the light ; beware of a light too powerful or dazzling. 
Sit so that the rays of light will fall over your shoulder upon the 
page before you. You will find it beneficial, when you are com- 
pelled to glue your eyes steadily to your task for a long period, 
to go to the window once in a while and relieve the eyes by focus- 
ing them for a brief time upon some distant object in the land- 
scape. 
Study is made easier by providing for bodily comfort during 
the time that one is closely engaged in thought, since nothing 
should take away from the vividness of the impression received 
by the nerve-cells. One should be seated comfortably; should 
not be too cold or too hot; should not be pelted and battered 
and shot through with noises from the street. A wise student 
knows when he has studied on a given occasion to the limit of 
efficiency, and then gives over. But it is a mistake to suppose 
that one cannot work unless one is in the mood for it. A normal
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
mind in a healthy body will work at need; and the best way to 
get the desired mood is to go to work. 
IV 
We should go about the preparation of a lesson as a general 
would set about the capture of a city; or as an engineer would 
endeavor to solve the problem of supplying a city with pure 
water; or as a detective would undertake the task of ferreting 
out a crime; or as you, yourself, would try to start a rabbit from 
a brush-heap. There is something at the heart of the lesson, and 
you must get at this the first thing. Ask yourself, What is the 
main idea—the interpreting thought—of this assignment? What 
is the key to this problem? What is the theme of this essay, the 
point at issue in this speech, the dominant or unifying emotion 
in this poem or drama? When once the student has seized this 
deeper inner meaning and has dragged it into the light, the 
minor points, the less important ideas, the illustrations, the 
examples—all these will fall into their proper places and will be 
easily understood and fully enjoyed. 
But the ideas involved in a lesson are not to be introduced into 
one’s anatomy merely as dead lumps of truth. They are to be 
reacted upon. Independent processes of thought must be set in 
motion. A boy ought to be excited by a new idea just as he 
would be excited by fresh tracks when out hunting. The mate- 
rial presented for consideration must be passed upon. It is to 
be arraigned before the high court of one’s own thought. Let 
us not be too modest to think. Doubtless the textbooks are about 
right; and it is to be presumed that the professor knows vastly 
more than does the pupil; and no doubt wise heads have weighed 
the matter. But notwithstanding all this, the student now sits 
supreme. It is his court; he is trying the case for himself and 
not for another. 
The student must next organize the whole matter that has been 
“brought before him in accordance with his own purpose and his 
own needs, so that he may carry away with him his own compact 
and usable kit of new and important information. There is a
-P-A-G-E-55
  HOW TO STUDY 55 
remainder of fact, or truth, or inspiration that results from the 
study of a given subject. This outcome of one’s thinking, whether 
large or small, becomes a lasting personal acquisition. It is not 
merely the asset of an hour, but is a possession for all time. The 
student has it not by rote or merely on authority, but upon indi- 
vidual approval and acceptance. 
Finally, knowledge results in permanent enrichment only 
when it has been put into play; that is, it must be related to 
life and must flow out in action. This explains why instructors 
frown upon “cramming.” “Crammed” information is for imme- 
diate use; and it passes away along with the crisis that led to 
its acquisition. It is, then, not to be thought for a moment that 
the final end or outcome of an assignment is the presentation 
of it to the instructor in recitation or examination. That is 
to miss the point entirely. Knowledge that is worth while will 
become so much a part of the student that he will forget when 
and where he got it. Not only will he have it; it will have him. 
That is, in so far as it is a workable thing, it will become habit. 
For example, you do not count yourself an expert with your 
gun, your camera, your automobile—nor do you get much enjoy- 
ment from them—until their manipulation has become second 
nature to you. In the same way, no lesson can ever be said to 
have been mastered until it has entered into and become a part 
of one. 
The sheer, brute work of memorizing does not amount to so 
much as is commonly supposed. When important subject-matter 
has been dealt with in some such way as has been suggested in the 
preceding paragraphs, one’s nervous system will remember of its 
own accord. The things that have interested us supremely— 
that we have considered worth while and have made a part of 
ourselves—we cannot forget. They have enmeshed themselves 
in our central being, and will always be promptly available. 
There are certain things such as spelling, the multiplication table, 
the facts of geography, and the Ten Commandments which had 
to be laid up in memory by an outright effort of the will by 
frequent repetition. There always will be a good deal of this  
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
pure memory work to be done; but, aside from stated demands 
of this kind, it will be of little avail simply to memorize mechan- 
ically. 
Besides, the quality of any individual memory is a fixed 
thing. One’s memory is either good, bad, or indifferent by 
nature. Each person is endowed with brain-stuff of a certain 
degree of power to take and hold impressions, and there will be 
no change of quality. Some minds are “wax to receive and 
marble to retain,” and some are quite the opposite. This is not 
to say that the memory of a given person may not be stronger 
and more retentive at one time than at another. Whatever 
strengthens or weakens the general state of bodily health—in 
particular the general condition of the nervous system—will no 
doubt affect the memory as well. But it seems certain that at 
bottom the memory does not yield to cultivation. 
Fortunately for most of us, however, that is not necessarily 
the best type of mind that has the most tenacious memory. It 
is a good sort of mind to have, but there are other qualities that 
may offset the lack of it. Some of the finest and most productive 
minds have been endowed with rather poor memory-stuff. The 
thing for a student to do is to find out and to practice the most 
approved methods of memorizing. That is all one can do; yet 
that may count for a good deal. Again, and finally, the best 
way to remember is to be so interested in a thing that one cannot 
forget it, and to connect it and inter-connect it with a thousand 
other interesting and familiar things. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Problems for Discussion in Class 
1. Diseuss with data from the articles, the different applications of 
fact as made by McMurry, Foster, and Lockwood. 
2. Restate the central idea of each article and discuss the difference 
in the breadth of the three themes. Give examples of narrow 
and of broad themes from your own school work.
-P-A-G-E-57
  HOW TO STUDY 57 
3. Tell which of Lockwood’s lines of thought you chose for intensive 
second reading. Explain your choice. 
4. Lockwood names three purposes or aims of study: (a) gaining 
definite knowledge, (b) mastering certain processes of thought, 
(c) grasping a few unchanging principles of work. With the 
third of these aims the activities of this book are largely con- 
cerned. What principles of study have so far been considered 
in Chapter I? 
5. Do you know of a concrete case which illustrates one of the crises 
suggested by Lockwood on pages 48-49 in the professional life 
of a lawyer, a doctor, a merchant, a nurse, or a mother? How 
did discipline of mind come into play in that case? 
6. “Present-minded and absent-minded.” Apply this contrast in one 
of the following situations: A crisis in a football game; exami- 
nation time; home-reading work; preparing a composition; a 
dress rehearsal. 
7. Cite some instances when a scrap of information stood you well 
in hand. 
8. With what principles of study considered by McMurry earlier 
in this chapter is Mr. Lockwood here primarily concerned? 
9. After reading Lockwood, what do you think is meant by “mastery 
of material”? 
10. Lockwood speaks of “your interests determining your world.” In 
the light of his diseussion, what is your world? 
Group Problems for Class Work 
1. Three kinds of data. We noticed on page 47 an important dis- 
tinction which may be repeated here for a different purpose: Consider 
three kinds of data, as used by the men whose articles you have read 
in this chapter. 
(a) Facts and figures. Example, Foster, page 39, “Of the 340 who 
entered college with conditions not 3 per cent won honor degrees in 
law.” 
(b) General truths, based on facts which are not reported in detail 
and which lie outside the average reader’s knowledge. McMurry, 
page 24: “We have had three great epidemics of yellow fever in our 
own country since 1790.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
(c) Reasons, based upon facts which might be presented if neces- 
sary, but which are unnecessary because they are very readily sup- 
plied from the reader’s own stock. Lockwood, page 51: “And study, 
finally, if no other interest serves, because you are a man.” 
Each of these writers, because of the nature of his subject, uses 
predominatingly one kind of data. However, each uses some of the 
other two kinds. In each article locate passages of the two kinds not 
named above as predominating. As an alternative for this assignment, 
find in any current magazine illustrations of the three kinds of data. 
2. Getting at the heart of a question (see Lockwood, page 54; 
MeMurry, page 23). Thomas Jefferson made a significant comment 
upon the parts taken by Benjamin Franklin and by George Washing- 
ton in the discussion that preceded the founding of our nation. Jeffer- 
son said that he never heard either of these men speak more than ten 
minutes at a time, adding that they laid their shoulders to the main 
points, because they knew that if these points were established, the 
smaller points would follow of themselves. Lockwood has in mind the 
same essential features of good thinking in his Section IV. “There is 
something at the heart of the lesson, and you must get at this the 
first thing.” 
By class discussion consider the following process of arriving at the 
heart of the question: 
THE ADVANTAGES OF A LITERARY SOCIETY 
(a) Enumerate all the points that might be made: 
(i) A literary society occupies the time of one long winter 
evening a week. 
(ii) We have parties after the program. 
(iii) It pleases our English teachers. 
(iv) It gives us practice in speaking. 
(v) We learn to work together. 
(vi) It brings together pupils of different school classes. 
(vii) It serves as the nucleus for our public dramatic perform- 
ances. 
(viii) We come in contact with some good literature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  HOW TO STUDY 59 
Add other arguments which might be made in favor of a literary 
society. 
(b) To find the central ideas of “The Advantages of a Literary 
Society,” rule out certain points, which may be considered side issues. 
With these omitted, you have left the heart of the question. 
(i) Rule out points that are irrelevant, that have to do with 
something quite different from a literary society. 
(ii) Rule out points that are petty or insignificant, of very lit- 
tle or of doubtful value. 
(iii) Rule out points that are partisan, that appeal to only a 
very small group of people. 
(iv) Rule out points that are personal, that apply to a single 
individual in a hostile or a too friendly way. 
(v) Rule out points that are doubtful, that cannot be sup- 
ported by fairly reliable data. 
(vi) Rule out points that are obvious, so plain that they need 
only mention, not discussion. 
(c) Through elass diseussion and board work arrive at the heart of 
one or more of the following questions: 
(i) What constitutes a good high school? 
(ii) What is “being a man,” or “being a woman” in the sense 
used by Lockwood? 
(iii) What is success in life? 
(iv) How does excellent poetry differ from mere doggerel? 
(v) What are the features of an interesting course? 
(vi) What was Washington’s service to America? 
(vii) What makes a winning basket-ball (or any other) team? 
(viii) What are the characteristics of “School Spirit”? 
(ix) What characteristics are needed in a good class president ? 
(x) What is the value of effective speaking? 
(xi) What makes an occupation, or “calling,” attractive?
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 THE NATURE OF STUDY 
(d) No one need to search his experience far to discover many deci- 
sions that he himself has made by ignoring the main issues and allow- 
ing some relatively trivial matter to have undue weight. For example: 
(i) A boy who accepts a permanent job because it pays $2.00 
a week more than another, with no thought of whither 
the job will lead him. Why might this temporary advan- 
tage in money rightly be an argument in favor of a 
summer vacation job? 
(ii) A girl who selects her friends because of the eut of their 
clothes. 
(iii) A student who elects a course because it is a “snap” or a 
“cinch.” 
(iv) A listener who admires a certain speaker because he has a 
melodious voice and graceful delivery. 
By class suggestions fill out the list of decisions made by ignoring 
main issues.

SECTION I 
TAKING NOTES ON READING REFERENCES 
PRINCIPLES OF TAKING NOTES 
Students are often called upon to cull out the essential parts 
of books and to preserve such material for future use in the form 
of notes. So large a share of school life is nowadays given to 
supplementary reading, and to the preparation of written and 
oral reports based upon reading projects, that note-taking has 
become one of the important requisites for excellent scholarship. 
Yet in this significant branch of their work many students 
develop haphazard practices, drifting along with notes in the 
form of miscellaneous scrawls on scraps of paper, forming no 
well-considered and definite plans of preserving in permanent 
form the results of their reading. The outcome of such lack of 
system is likely to be a very much lower standard of attainment 
than their native talents warrant. 
Unsystematie records upon odds and ends of paper constitute 
one type of faults in recording the results of reading or listening. 
Even more serious is the careless selection of data which are to 
be copied into notebooks or upon reading ecards. Students

scribble away in their laboratory books, desperately trying to 
take down “all the teacher says,” if they are listening to lectures ; 
or they laboriously copy in their books whole pages or entire 
chapters from assigned readings. Both practices disregard the 
primary principles of good workmanship which insist upon the 
omission of nonessentials, and concentration upon essentials. 
Ag good reader or listener is actively at work with his mind; 
he grasps the main idea of the passage read; he sees the or- 
der of the writer’s ideas; he places value upon the various 
parts, especially noting the major and the minor elements. And 
then on the basis of his own critical selection, he copies into his 
records only the essential ideas and most significant data of the 
author, together with a brief record of his own reactions to what 
the author says. 
Another very questionable practice is the taking of no notes 
whatever, and relying entirely upon unaided memory for the 
retention of valuable information. Doubtless some exceptional 
people can work in this manner. Lincoln is said never to have 
forgotten a single item of importance which he had once heard 
or read. If one were similarly blessed with retentive powers, 
he would be foolish to divide his attention between reading and 
recording. But the average mind needs the assistance of . 
records ; indeed, the very act of recording, when based upon eare- 
ful thinking as described above, is likely to impress the material 
upon the student’s memory. Moreover, if reading and listening” 
are regarded not merely as receptive processes—if they are con- 
sidered rather as reflective activities—then much of the matter 
recorded upon reading cards is the product, not of the author 
read, but of the note-taker himself. The fact is that an alert 
mind often has its richest ideas at the moment when it first 
encounters new matter. The first instinctive reaction is often- 
times the best. At any rate that initial reaction is worth record- 
ing for later consideration. And a written record of one’s own 
thinking, even if it be but a hint or a catchword placed upon a 
reading card, is commonly of immense aid to the memory.

S. S. Seward, discussing the faults of note-taking just con- 
sidered, explains: 
The problem reaches back to a more fundamental one, as to 
how far the writer and the reader respectively contribute to 
successful study. That the reader, indeed, has a share, and an 
important one, in the undertaking, is the crux of the whole mat- 
ter, and needs, therefore, thoroughly to be understood. The 
writer’s part is clear; the reader’s not so much so. One who 
benefits from study is not content to sit passively and be pumped 
into; that gives no play to his own mind. Nor will he be an 
automotive recording machine; that calls for industry, but 
searcely for intelligence. His part rather is one of active mental 
effort. The writer’s mind acts and the reader’s mind reacts and 
assimilates; it recognizes important matter, observes digressions, 
takes note of illustrations, relates part to part, and distinguishes 
the true sense from other meanings likely to be confused 
with it. 
With the active, constructive work of the reader in mind, some 
excellent teachers refuse to allow their students to copy materials 
exactly as they hear or read them. Such instructors say, “The 
points that Mr. B. makes in his book are his. They are his state- 
ments of fact and his judgments. Put in your records only the 
barest outline of what he says; fill your notebooks as full as you 
please of what you think concerning what Mr. B. says. Let your 
records show primarily the results of your own thinking and 
your own judgments.” Such teachers instruct students con- 
cerning assigned readings, “Copy very few sentences or para- 
graphs verbatim; instead, place in your notes a few headings 
to show the main order of the writer’s ideas; fill the great part 
of your pages with your own critical reactions to what you read.” 
USING A LIBRARY 
Before one begins to read and take notes, he needs, of course, 
to secure the books with which to work. Ordinarily he goes to a 
library to consult three kinds of references—books of general 
information upon his subject, the library catalogue of books,   
1Adapted with permission from S. S. Seward’s Note-Taking, page 8 Oopyright, 
Allyn and Bacon.

and periodical indexes. Brief lists of such library materials are 
presented below with directions for their use. 
(A) References containing general information 
Encyclopedias: Year Books: 
Americana World Almanac 
Britannica American Year Book 
Nelson’s Loose Leaf New International Year Book 
New International Statesman’s Year Book 
Materials are located in such general reference books by looking 
up in the indexes the subject of inquiry, and turning to the 
appropriate volumes and pages. 
(B) The library catalogue. A library or card catalogue is an 
index of the materials which the library contains. The cards are 
arranged alphabetically in the files as in a dictionary; that is, 
authors, subjects, and titles are all placed in one alphabetica! 
arrangement. The cards themselves are of three kinds, known as 
“author cards,” “subject cards,” and “title cards.” 
An author card has upon its first line the name of the 
author, and is filed in the catalogue under that name.

TITLE CARD 
This arrangement of author, subject, and title cards enables 
the reader to use the catalogue in various ways. 
(1) To find books by a given author, look for a card headed 
by his last name. 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
(2) For the life of a person, look for a card headed by the 
name of the author of the biography. 
(3) For material on any subject, look for a card headed by 
the name of the subject. 
(4) If you know the title of a book, but do not know the 
author, look for a card headed by the first word of that title 
not an article. 
(5) Having found the book you desire, note the “call number” 
which is always found in the left upper corner of a card. This 
call number will enable you to give the librarians the informa- 
tion they need to find your book in the library stacks. 
The call number consists of what is known as the classifica- 
tion number and the author’s number. The most common 
scheme of classification is the Dewey decimal system, which 
divides knowledge into ten main classes and subordinates these 
main divisions with many more. The ten main classes are as 
follows: 
0. General works 5. Natural science 
1. Philosophy 6. Useful arts 
2. Religion 7. Fine arts 
3. Sociology 8. Literature 
4. Philology 9. History 
(C) Periodical indexes to references in magazines. These 
furnish a means of locating references in current publications. 
The two most commonly used are Poole’s Index to Periodical 
Literature for English and American magazines, 1802-1907, 
and Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, 1900 to date. In 
both of these guides, there are three different ways of arranging 
information for the convenience of the library worker. 
(1) Material arranged by author entries: the name of the 
author of an article; the title of the article; and the reference 
to the magazine which contains the article. For example,
-P-A-G-E-69
  TAKING NOTES ON REFERENCES 69 
Mullet, Mary B. 
“Four Big Men Become Boys Again.” American Magazine, 
87: 34-7, Feb., ’19. 
(2) Material arranged by subject entries: the name of the 
subject ; the title of the article; the name of the author; and the 
reference to the magazine. For example, 
Inventions 
“How Edison Won the War” (Editorial Comment), Lit- 
erary Digest, 67: 26-7, Oct. 28, ’20. 
A fourth item often appears in the subject entries, namely, cross 
references to other articles upon the same or closely related 
subjects. 
(3) Materials arranged by title entries: the title of a poem 
or story; the name of the author; and the reference to the 
magazine. For example, 
“Qlimpse from the Train.” T. Hardy: Lit. Digest, 64: 38, 
Feb. 28, ’20. 
Obviously, the library worker makes use of the periodical 
indexes first by finding in the alphabetical arrangement the 
author, the subject, or the title he desires; second by choosing 
the most promising references under the heading thus found; 
and third by locating the magazines which contain the articles 
of largest promise for his purpose. 
EXAMPLES OF NOTE TAKING 
Suppose that a member of your class had found in the 
library and was reading “The High School Library,” Chapter 
IV in Sophia H. Powell’s book The Children’s Library. The 
early parts of Miss Powell’s chapter have pointed out that 
school experiences should teach pupils to enjoy reading. Then
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
follows the passage given below. Read it with this problem 
in mind: What entry, if any, would I make in my reading 
notes concerning this passage? 
Librarians have fancied that the craving for romance might 
be satisfied only by old tales and by certain good literature. 
No book can kindle the imagination as does scientific investi- 
gation. Science has introduced a new element of discovery, 
conquest, and adventure; a new idealism and a new idea of 
eulture—the discovery and conquest of natural forces, as 
thrilling as any tales of old; the idealism made possible by 
the discovery of an absolutely truthful universe, with which 
we must keep ourselves in tune; the culture which comes with 
the power of adjustment to this universe of law and order. 
Books of science which can present these truths without senti- 
mentality are needed in the high-school library as supplementary 
to the laboratory and to textbooks. 
There has been a tendency in writing about the high-school 
library to overemphasize its literary functions. This tendency 
has been common to those interested in vocational training as 
well as to librarians interested in the purely literary side of 
high-school library work. It should be emphasized that the 
vocational school cannot do without the library either on the 
cultural side or from the practical viewpoint. Vocational train- 
ing schools need a library strong in their special branches and in 
books with a more specific cultural value. Likewise—and this 
librarians are likely to overlook—as the academic high school is 
being more and more changed into a high school where both 
vocational and academic subjects are taught, so the high-school 
library, even when its chief function seems to be literary, 
eannot neglect the cultural values of the vocational studies 
and the books which represent such values. Librarians some- 
times say that such books are few. Is not their interest in this 
kind of literature more feeble than in that which has what is 
called “cultural” values? 
There is another sort of romance which may be presented 
to young people: the romance of modern industry. Just before 
his death William James declared that the modern heroes are 
to be found on the railroads and in the shops; that the soldiers 
of today are the doctors and the nurses who fight disease.

This is the message of Whitman: 
Away with old romance! 
Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts, 
I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for 
art, 
To exalt the present and the real, 
To teach the average man the glory of his daily work and 
trade, 
To manual work for each and all, to plow, hoe, dig, 
To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers, 
For every man to see to it that he really do something, . . . 
for every woman, too;

All occupations, duties, broad and close, 
Toil, healthy toil, and sweat.? 
Two sample reading cards which might be made by different 
students upon Miss Powell’s paragraphs are given below. The 
form of the cards, to be sure, might be different, depending 
upon the reactions of the student to the materials read.

“The high-school library, even when its chief function seems 
to be literary, cannot neglect the cultural aspects of the voca- 
tional studies and the books which represent such values.” 
Argument—there is romance in modern work, industry, pres- 
ent-day life, to be found in books; this romance needs to be 
revealed to high-school pupils, as well as the romances of more 
purely “literary” books.

Danger in this—seems to speak slightingly of good literature. 
Might be so interpreted. Two kinds of reading—one for infor- 
mation, one for culture and refinement; need both. 
  An examination of these two samples reveals characteristics 
which may be taken as the marks of good workmanship in 
the preparation of such reading cards: 
(1) The first item on each card is a topic, in the reader's 
own words, indicating the nature of the note. Such a topic 
is a valuable aid when the worker later makes use of his cards. 
(2) In a eonspicuous place is indicated an exact reference 
to the source, narfely, the author’s name, the title of the book, 
and the page or pages. 
(8) Direct citations from the author are copied verbatim, 
enclosed in quotation marks, with all omissions indicated by 
dots (...). The citations endeavor to record the main idea 
of the author in the passage read. 
(4) The first card includes a short paragraph in the stu- 
dent’s words summarizing the main argument of the passage 
from Miss Powell’s book. This record here given in the form 
of a summary might easily be changed into an abstract of 
the passage. 
(5) The last item on each ecard records the reader’s reaction 
to Miss Powell’s major idea. The reaction on the second card 
is in the nature of a criticism. 
(6) Each card contains but one unit of thought from the 
book read, the theme of which is stated in the topic upon the 
top line. To be sure, the single item may have two or more 
aspects, all on the same card. If the face of the card does
-P-A-G-E-73
  TAKING NOTES ON REFERENCES 13 
not furnish sufficient space, the back may be utilized also. 
It is a good rule never to include upon one card more than 
one of the author’s main ideas. 
(7) The ecards commonly used are 3 by 5 inches, the size 
of library cards. Some workers prefer 4 by 6 inches. The 
size is immaterial, except that the larger cards furnish more 
space. Experienced workers often use thin paper, sometimes of 
different colors, which can be filed in a pasteboard box. The 
contrasting colors often are a great aid in classifying notes. 
The seven points just enumerated are characteristics of good 
reading cards. If the worker prefers to use a notebook rather 
than cards for his notes, the same general form of reading 
records is advisable. The endeavor to use notes that are run 
together promiscuously in a closed-leaf notebook is often very 
exasperating. From a loose-leaf notebook, on the contrary, 
sheets may readily be taken out, and rearranged and reclassified 
as the bulk of reading notes increases. Obviously a loose-leaf 
book of small size is more economical for reading records than 
a larger book. 
ASSEMBLING NOTES FOR A REPORT 
A task more common in high-school life than the taking of 
notes from general reading is the assembling of material for 
a written or oral report on an assigned topic. Suppose that 
in history or in science a student is assigned the topic “Thomas 
A. Edison.” The student’s classmates know Mr. Edison as 
a great inventor who specializes in electricity and in the re- 
production of sound; and this is about the extent of their 
information. What data shall the student assemble to give 
his classmates a more complete and reliable acquaintance with 
the modern wizard of science? How shall he go about collect- 
ing that data? What reading notes shall he take? 
(1) Ascertain what material is available. 
(a) Standard books: 
Who's Who in America. 
Encyclopedias.

dated 1896, and Sixty Years of an Inventor’s Life, 1908. The 
later book has seven chapters; from an examination of the 
headings of the chapters the student sees the possibility of 
discussing such topies as: Edison’s ancestry, his childhood, his 
work as a telegraph operator, his career as an inventor and 
manufacturer, three of his important inventions, his person- 
ality, his war record. 
To arrange the material in usable form, notes are impera-

Device for Detecting Submarines. 
“Convinced that if he could install on a ship a device—always 
be from ten to twenty feet ahead of the bow of the vessel and 
if this device should carry a vibrating diaphragm, it would 
not have to contend with the noises of the ship itself (as these 
would be made inaudible). 
“This device was afterward given practical tests in very rough 
seas, fulfilling all requirements, and was not in any way dam- 
aged—even in the roughest sort of cross seas, with the vessel 
going at full speed—fourteen knots per hour. 
“With this device boats moving seventeen hundred yards away 
could be readily heard while the vessel was going at full speed. 
The submarine bell five and one-half miles away could be heard 
by the operator while a big storm was in progress and the 
boat proceeding at full speed, and this only with plain dia- 
phragms. 
“With this device there would be no difficulty whatever in hear- 
ing a torpedo more than four thousand yards away, and that is 
far beyond the effective distance at which a torpedo can be 
launched from a submarine. The noise made by a torpedo is 
very piercing and peculiarly distinctive.” 
  As explained above, the worker who has been diligent and 
accurate in assembling carefully arranged material from his 
reading finds the task of organizing and writing his article com- 
paratively easy. The topics, in the most conspicuous place on 
various cards, often furnish him valuable suggestions for the 
main divisions of his report. Moreover, since there is only one 
reference on each card or sheet, the pack is easily distributed 
into the order in which the various items are to appear in the 
finished paper. Still further, the student finds that much of the 
thinking which is to constitute his own discussion is suggested by 
the personal reactions which he placed upon the cards while he

was taking notes. One who has felt the satisfaction of having 
reading materials in workmanlike shape, as he sits down to pre- 
pare a report, is not likely in the future to neglect such an easily

Make definite plans for 1, 2, and 10; work in class upon some of the 
others. 
1. Take notes of an assembly talk. Compare your notes with those 
of your classmates. See if you agree on the main points. 
2. The next time you have oral discussions in any class, list the 
main points of the speakers. If you find difficulty, determine whether 
the fault lies with you or with the speakers. 
3. Read the selection beginning on page 80. 
(a) Make a list of the main points in the entire article. 
(b) Select the most important thought in each paragraph. 
(c) What is the relationship between the first and the second 
main points? 
4. Have someone read in class part of a lecture by a noted speaker. 
Test your ability on the first reading to get the main points; on the 
second to fill in with the details and illustrations needed for a clear 
understanding of the lecture. 
5. Examine reading notes which you have prepared for any of your 
classes. Which of them are summaries? Change some of them into 
topical outlines. Which of your notes are quotations? Write a sum- 
mary for one or more of these. Which do you prefer: the quotation, 
the outline, or the summary? Why? When is each appropriate? 
6. Make a topical outline of one of Lincoln’s shorter addresses.

8. Each student should name three subjects suitable for reference 
work through The Reader’s Guide. From a class list placed on the 
board, let each select one subject, look it up, and report’ to the class. 
9. Class contest: Let each student prepare a set of three to twelve 
reading cards on a chapter or article assigned by the teacher. Submit 
these cards, without names, to a committee from another class. Re- 
quest the committee to select the three best sets of cards judged by the 
standards on page 72. Perhaps you can plan for such a contest 
among the various English and history classes in your school. 
10. Bearing in mind that you cannot tell everything, make an out- 
line for a short talk on some important current topic. A committee 
may select three of the outlines and request the authors to give their 
talks to the class. 
11. If you are near a library consult the magazine indexes and find 
a reference to: playing tennis; Mr. Coolidge’s family; Carl Sandburg’s 
poetry; polar expeditions; radio; the “All-American football team”; 
the Spanish war in Morocco. Copy exactly the data from the index 
for one reference on each subject. 
12. Library exercise: Divide among a group of the class the points 
in the following passage which may be looked up in your school or city 
library. Find suitable references and prepare suitable reading cards. 
The library is the one place where time and space are set at naught. 
It is the microcosm of the universe. Here all the wonders of nature 
are flashed back from the mirrors of eyes that have beheld them. 
Here India and the Arctic and the isles of the sea are as close at 
hand as Niagara. 
Here Archimedes’s lever, Giotto’s circle, Newton’s apple, Palis 
furnace, Jaequard’s loom, Jamie Watt’s teakettle, Franklin’s kite, ave 
cheek by jowl with the latest Marconigram. 
Here the fate of Aristides, of Columbus, of Gordon, is as clear to 
read as the doings of yesterday in Chicago. The record of what hap- 
pened at Thermopylae, at Lucknow, at the Alamo, receives beside it the 
tale of the courage that rose as the Titanic sank. 
What Buddha and Socrates and Jesus taught answers the ery and 
strengthens the heart of doubt and pain today. The library is the great 
whispering gallery of noble deeds and, catching a whisper, 
“The youth replies, I can,” ,     
and goes forth.t

I. BODILY VIGOR 
To secure the highest mental efficiency we must give due con- 
sideration to bodily culture. Any education which disregards 
this is a failure. Every student should have sufficient food, 
adequate sleep, proper exercise, abundant recreation; in every 
way he should seek to promote bodily vigor.

SENSIBLE ACTIVITIES OF SCHOOL LIFE 81 
No absolute rules can be laid down with reference to periods 
of work and rest, because there are great individual differences 
in this as in other characteristics. Some persons can walk only 
a short distance without great fatigue, while others can tramp 
all day without rest. Some can do heavy physical work, but 
only at a slow pace, while others work by spurts and then require 
rest. Similar conditions obtain in mental work. Some people 
work fourteen hours a day the year round without a vacation, 
while others seem never to be at work, but really accomplish 
astonishing results because of the intensity while occupied. 
Similarly, students vary greatly in their methods and powers 
of mental work. 
It is often maintained that during the morning hours far 
more work ean be accomplished than at any other period of the 
day. Sometimes people think that the nighttime is itself respon- 
sible for fatigue and the morning hours for the abundant vigor. 
According to this idea, then, would not the daytime hours be the 
best for invigoration through sleep? Doubtless the best work 
is usually accomplished with the least effort in the morning, 
after a night’s refreshing sleep. But it is probably true that 
such is the case because of the sleep, and rest, rather than 
because of the time of day. 
Sleep as a factor in student life does not receive adequate 
consideration from many students. The student who does not 
take regular and sufficient sleep is pilfering his own bank 
account. There is absolutely no substitute for it, and when once 
lost, restitution cannot be made even by a nap in the classroom. 
Nervous tissues exhausted by a day’s activities ean be restored 
only by sleep. Nine hours of sleep and a good breakfast would 
not be a bad rule to guide student life. Parties, athletic jaunts, 
examination crams, and even working for one’s living, which 
eause students to remain awake beyond the midnight hour, 
transgress all laws of mental and physical hygiene. There is 
doubtless no cause so frequently producing nervous breakdown 
as loss of sleep.

  82 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
I. ASSOCIATIONS 
The student who goes to school to become a hermit, not touch- 
ing elbows with his mates and developing no interests through 
hearing music, attending lectures on varied subjects, seeing 
nothing of the great busy world about him, misses a vital factor 
of school life. His procedure is uneconomical, for when he 
enters the busy, bustling world, he will find himself behind the 
procession. Because he has not seen the larger world while 
acquiring his book knowledge, he will often feel that the world 
is somehow out of joint because it does not conform to his book- 
ish ways. To become efficient he must begin again and study 
the world about him. He must gain its viewpoint, adjust him- 
self to it; he must now try to gain friendships which should 
have been established during his school life. All this is a waste- 
ful, selfish process. 
On the other hand, some students need to be cautioned when 
they make the opposite and equally grave error of saying, “My 
associates teach me more than my books and class work.” Pos- 
sibly they do, but it is not the fault of the books nor of the 
classes, nor any compliment to the associates. Another says, “I 
study men, not books.” This is sound, if rightly interpreted, 
but the student should know that there are some men besides 
fellow students well worth knowing. Some of them can only 
be known by going to their books. He should learn to study 
individuals as well as masses, the world’s teachers as well as his 
own classmates; he should look up as well as around. The school 
training is certainly a failure if it has not given the student last- 
ing acquaintanceships with a few superior students, some great 
men on its faculties, and many of the world’s intellectual wise 
men who can only be known through the pages of history and the 
great literatures of all ages. 
It is through books and master minds that the student should 
get meaning for all his varied observations and activities. To 
regard books and class work as something to be endured is to
-P-A-G-E-83
  SENSIBLE ACTIVITIES OF SCHOOL LIFE 83 
miss the whole point of education. Schools are founded and 
maintained for the specific purpose of furnishing books and 
teachers; all class work, once selected, should have the right of 
way. Student programs should not be overloaded; they should 
be so arranged that all the healthful activities may be duly 
emphasized. Recreation as well as work should become a part 
of one’s religion. The gospel of relaxation needs evangelists as 
well as the gospel of work. 
Ill. HOW HABITS ARE MADE 
It is important for the student to understand early the force 
and value of habit. Much time is lost by every one of us because 
our early training did not render automatic all those activities 
that we have to perform constantly and in the same way. Purely 
mechanical work can be controlled more economically by lower 
nervous centers than by higher. In childhood and youth the 
nervous system is plastic, a prime condition for memorizing and 
fixing habits. Among the habits that should become ingrained 
during this period are those of correct bodily postures and 
activities, correct speech, command of the multiplication table, 
spelling, writing, and habits involved in learning to speak for- 
eign languages. Most habits are controlled by the spinal cord, 
which is early developed. Hence we should form habits early, 
so that the brain may be relieved later of mechanical work and 
be concerned with higher operations. 
As Dr. Balliet has observed, “At first a child uses his brain 
in walking; later he can walk from habit and walks therefore 
with his spinal cord.’’ At first we spell with painful conscious- 
ness; later we spell familiar words of our vocabulary with little 
or no consciousness. We should be trained to write and spell 
mainly with the spinal cord, and to use all our brain power in 
thinking the thoughts to be expressed. We do many things with 
the spinal cord to relieve the brain. We walk with the spinal 
cord; we write and spell with the cord; I suppose we knit and 
gossip with the spinal cord; indeed, we sometimes sing and pray, 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  a 
84 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
not with our hearts, nor with our brains, but with the upper part 
of our spinal cords. We raise our hats to each other, not with our 
brains, but mainly with our spinal cords; when we meet people 
whom we do not wish to see, we often shake hands mechanically 
with our spinal cords. When we are learning a habit we must 
be conscious of it. The boys will remember how they had at first 
to think of taking off their hats to ladies. Later, they perform 
the act without thinking. In short, the nervous control has 
shifted from the brain centers to the spinal cord centers. 
Not only do such elementary physical activities become auto- 
matic, but processes of judging and reasoning must also become 
largely mechanical before becoming serviceable, One’s thinking 
is largely specialized, and judgment outside of the well-beaten 
track of thinking is not very valuable. The lawyer’s opinion 
concerning disease is slowly formed and unreliable; the doctor’s 
judgment about legal matters likewise is of small value. The 
expert in a given line is one who has studied widely and who 
ean form instantaneous judgments because of the habitual con- 
sideration of the data. Difficult studies pursued through a long 
time until mastery is complete become as simple as the alphabet. 
Mathematicians become so familiar with calculus that they read 
it for recreation when fatigued with other work. The lawyer 
ean instaritly cite scores of cases and precedents for which the 
novice would have required hours to summon to the foreground 
of consciousness. Hence, when knowledge is to become usable 
it must be pondered long and every detail absolutely appro- 
priated. 
Even the will is much more a matter of habit than we usually 
think. The will is too often regarded as a sort of ghost which 
pursues us about, compelling us to do certain things and pro- 
hibiting us from doing certain other things. Everyone is sup- 
posed by popular belief to have at birth a will of unchange- 
able quality and quantity. This is absolutely incorrect. The 
child has impulses, but has practically no will. His will must 
grow and develop. We use the will when we perform actions 
which we control. When we lack control, either muscular or
-P-A-G-E-85
  SENSIBLE ACTIVITIES OF SCHOOL LIFE 85 
mental, we lack will, or possess a diseased will. When a child 
can pick up a pin, thread a needle, tie a knot, walk with- 
out tottering, run, and talk plainly, he manifests definite mental 
and muscular control and therefore manifests voluntary power. 
Iv. INDEPENDENCE OF THINKING 
Independence of thinking is another rare but thoroughly im- 
portant mode of activity. Many people are so unused to think- 
ing for themselves that they would be frightened at the appear- 
ance in consciousness of a thought really their own. It has 
been said that “animals think not at all and some men a little.” 
Most of the thinking of the world is carried on by a few indi- 
viduals. The rest of the world are mere echoists. This is a 
terribly wasteful process. If more people were independent 
thinkers there would not be a yearly output of millions of barrels 
of patent medicines, the main ingredients of which are alcoholic 
preservatives.. Soothing sirups with opiates are fed to children 
because they are said to ery for them. The children are quieted, 
oftentimes so effectually as to be stupid through life. “Harm- 
less vegetable remedies” is a magical phrase. Perhaps this is 
why so many take extract of hops and barley, spirits of corn, 
nicotine, and opium! 
Because of lack of independence of thought, superstitions 
have always hindered the world’s progress. Even today the 
number 13 is so ominous that you cannot get a room number 13 
at a hotel, and you ean scarcely have thirteen at a table. Friday 
is considered so unlucky that some steamship companies hesitate 
to make sailing dates on that day of the week. Farmers still — 
plant their potatoes “in the moon,” and old women carry pota- 
toes in their pockets to cure rheumatism. Only a few days ago 
I saw a man who had a rattlesnake’s tail in his hatband to ward 
off rheumatism. Clairvoyants and fortune-tellers apparently find 
plenty of dupes, if we are to judge by the wealth of their adver- 
tising. Thus on every hand we find ample evidence that people 
are sinning and being sinned against simply because of their 
own unwillingness or inability to think. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
There is much in modern student life that militates against 
the deepest thinking. With the multiplication of student activi- 
ties, have not the opportunities for quiet thinking decreased? 
With football, baseball, basketball, tennis, rowing, skating, the 
literary society, the dramatic club, the freshman banquet, the 
sophomore cotillion, the juniot prom, the senior hop, numberless 
parties, the various church, social, and other engagements, be- 
sides the loafing hour, the theater, concert, special lectures galore, 
the newspapers and magazines to scan, one might well exclaim, 
“And when do they find time to think?” 
-Many students engage in altogether too many activities. In 
my own observation I have known several who arrested their 
development badly by putting too many irons in the fire. A 
student’s popularity is not infrequently the cause of his intel- 
lectual arrest. By attempting debates, athletics, dramaties, study, 
and society, all at the same time, his energies are dissipated, his 
growth stunted, while his plodding companion by everlastingly 
keeping at a few things finally becomes a master and frequently 
astonishes even himself as well as his acquaintances. The stu- 
dent must learn to say no to the siren’s voice which continually 
beckons him on to new fields. 
I sometimes feel that there ought to be some course labeled 
“thinking” in which the individual should be isolated from every- 
body long enough really to empty his mind of all ideas which are 
merely echoes, and then to discern what are really his own. 
With all the distractions of active life, the time may come when 
it would be a blessing for the state to imprison a few great men 
each year and allow them only pen, ink, and paper. It may have 
been fortunate for the world that John Bunyan languished in 
prison until his thoughts had had time to germinate and come 
to full fruition. Possibly the blind Milton, shut away from the 
distractions of sight, may have looked within and discovered 
thoughts that had been struggling for expression, but had been 
stifled by the many distracting interests possessed by a man of 
keen sight. 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
SENSIBLE ACTIVITIES OF SCHOOL LIFE 87 
Vv. STUDYING AND CRAMMING 
While we have rightly emphasized group activities as an aid in 
developing altruism, I wonder whether students do not some- 
times misinterpret its meaning. Self-activity is fundamental in 
the process of acquiring knowledge. No knowledge is of much 
value that is not made one’s own personal possession. This means 
more than the recital of words and formulas gained from books 
and companions. In their desire to be helpful, I sometimes see 
students in groups, even sitting on the stairways when the crowds 
are passing, believing they are studying together. When one 
hears the bits of gossip interspersed between the formulas, the 
declensions, and historical dates, one wonders where the calm 
reflection, deep concentration, analysis, comparison, doubt, con- 
templation, deliberation, complete abstraction, enter in. 
In student life it is important to master thoroughly a task as 
speedily as possible. To skim over a lesson and leave it without 
mastery is wasteful. The skimming process may be repeated a 
dozen times in this way and leave the lesson only half learned. 
Hence, “Whatsoever thou findest to do, do it with all thy mind 
and with all thy heart and with all thy strength.” In master- 
ing things “for keeps” two attitudes are necessary—interest and 
attention. Attention is the mother of memory; interest is the 
mother of attention. Hence, if you would secure memory, you 
must capture the mother and the grandmother. It is the business 
of us all to be interested in what we do, and it is unethical to 
regard our work as drudgery. I sometimes say to students, “You 
never will be great successes until your work has come to occupy 
all your waking moments and even your hours of sleep. It must 
be your life. If you wish to know what you are interested in, 
just catch yourself suddenly when you have no prescribed task, 
to see what you are thinking about. Those great dominating, 
insistent ideas indicate your real interests.” 
May I say a word on the question of cramming for examina- 
tions? The method is a delusion and a snare. Ideas are not
-P-A-G-E-88
88 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
grasped, associations are not made, brain tracks are not made 
permanent ; and even though the student might pass an examina- 
tion on such possessions, mental possessions gained by cramming, 
like the notes of an insolvent bank, are found to be worthless 
trash when put to real use. The cramming process may leave one, 
not with wisdom more to be prized than fine gold, but only with 
bogus certificates. Make your mental acquisitions absolutely ° 
your own while going over the subject day by day, take ten hours 
of sleep before every examination day, and do not fear the re- 
sults. In trying to make possessions most permanent, I give 
frequently the following recipe: Study your lesson as if you 
expected to teach it. When you can teach it to someone else you 
possess it. Try sometimes actually to teach your lesson; inflict 
it upon an imaginary pupil. Someone has said, “TI do not lecture 
to instruct others, but to clear up my own ideas.” 
VI, VALUE OF EARLY YEARS 
Students should early recognize the importance of making the 
most of the morning of life. Biologists emphasize the economic 
value of the period of infancy. By infancy I do not mean alone 
the period when the child is in the cradle. Biologically it in- 
eludes all the period of life from birth to maturity. It is the 
period of educability, the period when the individual can be 
molded and modified—in other words, educated. The longer the 
period of infancy, the higher the degree of educability. The 
newly-hatched chick has a short period of infancy. On emerg- 
ing from the egg, it can perform almost all the activities which 
it will ever be able to perform. It has very little to learn, very 
little possibility of learning, and very little time in which to 
learn. The young dog has more to learn, a longer period in 
which to learn it, and larger possibilities of acquiring new activi- 
ties. The human being has the longest period of infancy. After 
this period, the possibilities of education grow less and less. 
To young students who may read this, I desire to give a few 
words of comfort. You may be frequently derided by the upper
-P-A-G-E-89
SENSIBLE ACTIVITIES OF SCHOOL LIFE 89 
elassmen, who call you “greenies” or “freshies.” Take comfort 
and regard the name “freshmen” as a mark of honor rather than 
derision. To be fresh or to be green means that you are still 
growing. All should wish to be greenand to grow as long as 
possible. May you live to a green old age. Even the sopho- 
mores are all right. Woodrow Wilson said, “A sophomore is one 
in whom the sap is rising but has not yet reached his head. 
He will eventually mature.” 
Professor James says that one seldom gets an entirely new 
idea into his head after thirty. After that period one may erect 
a splendid structure upon the foundation already laid. But if 
any subsequent structure is to be reared, the proper foundation 
must have been laid before that time. For, “Outside of their 
own business,” says James, “the ideas gained by men before they 
are twenty-five are practically the only ideas they shall have in 
all their lives.” We cannot get anything new, for the period of 
curiosity is past, instincts have died out, bonds of association 
have become fixed, “mental grooves and channels set, the power 
of assimilation gone.” Hardly ever is a foreign language learned 
after twenty spoken without a foreign accent. “In most of us, 
by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will 
never soften again.”” The most possible should be made of early 
life, for, although it is a fact that the number of cells in a given 
brain is complete at birth, yet mental exercise must determine 
the number that become fully developed. Moreover, the period 
for development lies largely between birth and maturity. It is 
the period when nerve matter is plastic and when growth and 
replacement exceed disintegration. 
Brain workers do their best between the ages of twenty-five 
and forty-five; before that they are preparing for work; after 
that their work, no matter how extensive, is largely routine. 
Lawyers and physicians do much of their practice after forty, 
but the learning was accomplished before forty or forty-five. 
Successful merchants lay the foundations for wealth and success 
in youth and middle life. The great men that we know are 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
usually old men; but the foundations for their greatness were 
laid when they were young. 
Statesmen have projected their greatest acts of legislation, 
diplomacy, and reform in early life. In the morning of life 
scientists have wrought out their data and practically formulated 
their theories; generals and admirals have gained their greatest 
victories ; lawyers have paved the way for leadership at the bar, 
physicians have laid the groundwork for their greatest discov- 
eries ; poets and artists and musicians have planned,jand in many 
instances executed, their greatest masterpieces. 
You, young men and women of the high schools and colleges, 
are selected individuals. A process of selection and sifting going 
on for many years in your own lives, and for generations in your 
ancestors, determined who should go to the higher schools. The 
state endows its schools to enable its best minds to secure the 
development which their native worth makes possible. The func- 
tion of the school and the college is not to create brains, but to 
mature them. The school is like a problem in multiplication in, 
which the student is the multiplicand.and the institution the 
multiplier, and, as in mathematics, if we have significant figures 
for our multiplicand the result is significant, but if we have 
ciphers for the multiplicand the result must be zero. 
Your efficiency in life depends largely upon your physical and 
mental health and your habits.of work, rest, and recreation. To 
conserve your inborn possibilities and to multiply your talents 
is not only a high privilege, but your greatest immediate duty. 
To fail is to be morally culpable; to succeed betokens true wis- 
dom and virtue. No worthier object of contemplation can occupy 
your mind than the advice of Socrates, “Know thyself.”

Exercise 
When you have carefully reread the division which you selected 
from Mr. Bolton’s discussion, prepare a reading card recording a brief 
quotation and a paragraph of your own comment, like the following: 
  
Ill. Forming Habits Early. Bolton, F. H., The Mind at 
Work, pages 83-84. 
We should form habits early, so that the brain may be re- 
lieved later of mechanical work and be concerned with higher 
operations. 
It is interesting to note the contrast between classes which are 
just beginning and those which are just finishing stenography 
or typewriting in our Commercial Department. Practice exer- 
cises of the beginning pupils are very slow and painful proc- 
esses; both their brains and their hands move awkwardly; 
each separate act must be consciously directed while the begin- 
ners are forming their habits. How different are the expert 
seniors! The symbols of stenography come tripping upon the 
page with no effort, fingers fly above the typewriter keys, 
while the minds of the workers are busy with the thoughts 
they are transcribing. 
  
  Have a class committee select, copy, and mount. on a chart ten of 
the best notes. Post the chart on the bulletin board. 
Problems for Class Discussion 
Select your task and take fifteen minutes for preparation. 
1. “The demands for variety frequently allure to new fields before 
assimilation has been effected.” Is there an example in your school 
life of going after a new line of interest before you have mastered some 
line you had already undertaken? 
2. Lord Salisbury, a Foreign Minister of England, once said of Lord 
Curzon, Viceroy of India, “We can always count on Curzon; he has 
a cool head, a strong hand, and a true heart.” In what part of his 
article might Mr. Bolton most appropriately have made use of this 
illustration? Explain. 
3. Who are the outstanding “thinkers” of the present day in one or 
in several lines of activity? Name only men and women who have

lived during the past ten years. For example, Dallas Lore Sharp in 
the field of Nature. See how many you can name in a class discussion. 
Use the blackboard. Plan a series of class reports to be given after 
reading and study on “Thinkers of Today.” 
4. How our school guards against participation in too many “out- 
side activities.” Justify this in the light of Bolton’s argument. 
5. The old saying, “Necessity is the mother of invention,” has been 
parodied, “Laziness is the mother of invention.” Give a concrete illus- 
tration of each of these sayings, showing the difference in meaning. 
Individual Projects 
1. “Most habits are controlled by the spinal cord.” (Bolton, page 83.) 
Some member of the class who is expert in physiology may explain 
with diagrams how this is true. Let the student selected secure, if 
necessary, the codperation of the science teacher best fitted to give the 
advice and guidance. Perhaps your science teacher would be willing 
to explain to this class the very vital principle of habit formation 
involved in the statement quoted. 
2. Several interesting articles have recently appeared upon the gen- 
eral topic of “Outside Activities in High-school Life.” If you are near 
a college library, you can read and report to the class one of the 
following: 
(a) “Extra-Curricular Activities and Scholarship,” P. P. Boyd, 
School and Society, Vol. 13, page 158. 
(b) “Social Life of High School Girls,” Olivia Pound, The

3. Dean Le Baron R. Briggs of Harvard has a book School, College 
and Character; President William DeWitt Hyde of Bowdoin has one, 
The College Man and the College Woman; Dean F. C. Lockwood of the 
University of Arizona, one called The Freshman and His College. Be 
prepared to report some of the big ideas in the book you select.

Reading suggestions 
(1) This selection, written by one of the most distinguished Amer- 
ican students of human nature, William James, is remarkable in many 
ways. You are asked to notice especially how easy he makes what is 
usually considered a difficult subject. He accomplishes this feat by the 
use of homely concrete illustrations with many of which the average 
reader is certain to be familiar. 
(2) Outlined in Mr. James’s selection are what are today considered 
the four laws of habit formation. James borrows the first two of these 
maxims from another writer and adds two others. 
Mazim I. In breaking old and forming new habits, take care to 
launch yourself with as strong and decided an initiative as 
possible. 
Maxim II. Never suffer an exception to occur till the new 
habit is securely rooted in your life. 
Maxim III. Seize the very first opportunity to act on every 
resolution you make. . . . 
Maxim IV. Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little 
exercise every day. 
(3) It will at once occur to you that James is speaking primarily of 
moral habits. The question will naturally arise whether the maxims 
apply in the formation of habits other than those of morality. The 
answer is affirmative. Habits like correctness in punctuation, skill in 
taking notes, regularity of study hours, neatness of person, punctual- 
ity, politeness, and the like, are all subject to the laws of habit forma- 
tion enumerated by James. :

(4) You have been asked in the articles of this chapter to consider 
certain desirable and other undesirable habits in the life of a student. 
As you have come upon them, both good and bad, you have been think- 
ing about your own needs in respect to each, solely from the viewpoint 
of efficiency and capability in workmanship. Read the article of James’s 
to acquaint yourself with the laws of habit formation which anyone 
must apply if he is determined to move in the direction of breaking old 
and establishing new habits. 
“Habit a second nature! Habit is ten times nature,” the 
Duke of Wellington is said to have exclaimed; and the degree to 
which this is true no one can probably appreciate as well as one 
who is a veteran soldier himself. The daily drill and the years 
of discipline end by fashioning a man completely over again as 
to most of the possibilities of his conduct. 
“There is a story,” says Professor Huxley, “which is credible 
enough, though it may not be true, of a practical joker, who, 
seeing a discharged veteran carrying home his dinner, suddenly 
ealled out, ‘Attention!’ whereupon the man instantly brought 
his hands down, and lost his mutton and potatoes in the gutter. 
The drill had been thorough, and its effects had become embodied 
in the man’s nervous structure.” 
Riderless cavalry horses, at many a battle, have been seen to 
come together and go through their customary evolutions at the 
sound of the bugle call. Most trained domestic animals, dogs 
and oxen, and omnibus and ecar-horses, seem to be machines 
almost pure and simple, undoubtingly, unhesitatingly, doing 
from minute to minute the duties they have been taught, and 
giving no sign that the possibility of an alternative ever suggests 
itself to their mind. Men grown old in prison have asked to be 
readmitted after being once set free. In a railroad accident to 
a traveling menagerie in the United States some time in 1884, 
a tiger, whose cage had been broken open, is said to have emerged, 
but presently crept back again, as if too much bewildered by his 
new responsibilities, so that he was without difficulty secured. 
Habit is thus the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most pre-

cious conservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within 
the bounds of ordinance,! and saves the children of fortune from 
the envious uprisings of the poor. It alone prevents the hardest 
and most repulsive walks of life from being deserted by those 
brought up to tread therein. It keeps the fisherman and the 
deckhand at sea through the winter; it holds the miner in his 
darkness, and nails the countryman to his log-cabin and his 
lonely farm through all the months of snow; it protects us from 
invasion by the natives of the desert and the frozen zone. It 
dooms us all to fight out the battle of life upon the lines of our 
nurture or our early choice, and to make the best of a pursuit 
that disagrees, because there is no other for which we are fitted, 
and it is too late to begin again. It keeps different social strata 
from mixing. Already at the age of twenty-five you see the 
professional mannerism settling down on the young commercial 
traveler, on the young doctor, on the young minister, on the 
young counselor-at-law. You see the little lines of cleavage 
running through the character, the tricks of thought, the prej- 
udices, the ways of the “shop,” in a word, from which the man 
can by and by no more escape than his coat sleeve can suddenly 
fall into a new set of folds. On the whole, it is best he should 
not escape. It is well for the world that in most of us, by the 
age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will never 
soften again. 
If the period between twenty and thirty is the critical one in 
the formation of intellectual and professional habits, the period 
below twenty is more important still for the fixing of personal 
abits, properly so called, such as vocalization and pronunciation, 
gesture, motion, and address. Hardly ever is a language learned 
after twenty spoken without a foreign accent; hardly ever can a 
youth transferred to the society of his betters unlearn the nasal- 
ity and other vices of speech bred in him by the associations of 
his growing years. Hardly ever indeed, no matter how much 
money there may be in his pocket, can he even learn to dress

like a gentleman born. The merchants offer their wares as 
eagerly to him as to the veriest “swell,” but he simply cannot buy 
the right things. An invisible law, as strong as gravitation, 
keeps him within his orbit, arrayed this year as he was the last; 
and how his better-bred acquaintances contrive to get the things 
they wear will be for him a mystery till his dying day... . 
The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous 
system our ally instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capi- 
talize our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of the 
fund. For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as 
possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard against 
the growing into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to 
us, as we should guard against the plague. The more of the 
details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody 
of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set 
free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable 
human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indeci- 
sion, and for whom the time of rising and going to bed every 
day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of 
express thoughts and acts of will, volitional deliberation. Full 
half the time of such a man goes to the deciding, or regretting, of 
matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as practically not 
to exist for his consciousness at all. If there be such daily duties 
not yet ingrained in any one of my readers, let him begin this 
very hour to set the matter right. 
In Professor Bain’s chapter on “The Moral Habits” there are 
some admirable practical remarks laid down. Two great maxims 
emerge from his treatment. The first is that in the acquisition 
of a new habit, or the leaving off of an old one, we must take 
eare to launch ourselves with as strong and decided an initiative 
as possible. Accumulate all the possible circumstances which 
shall reénforce the right motives; put yourself assiduously? in 
conditions that encourage the new way; make engagements in- 
  
ISubjects of express . . . volitional deliberation, subjects of careful thought and 
of acts of the will. 
*Assiduously, persistently.
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE FORMATION OF GOOD HABITS 97 
compatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the case allows; 
in short, envelop your resolution with every aid you know. This 
will give your new beginning such a momentum that the tempta- 
tion to break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise might ; 
and every day during which a breakdown is postponed adds to 
the chances of its not occurring at all. 
The second maxim is: Never suffer an exception to occur till 
the new habit is securely rooted in your life. Bach lapse is like 
the letting fall of a ball of string which one is carefully winding 
up; a single slip undoes more than a great many turns will wind 
again. Continuity of training is the great means of making the 
nervous system act infallibly right... . 
The need of securing success at the outset is imperative. Fail- 
ure at first is apt to dampen the energy of all future attempts, 
whereas past experience of success nerves one to future vigor. 
Goethe said to a man who consulted him about an enterprise but 
mistrusted his own powers: “Ach! you need only blow on your 
hands!” And the remark illustrates the effect on Goethe’s 
spirits of his own habitually successful career. Professor Bau- 
mann, from whom I borrow the anecdote, says that the collapse 
of barbarian nations when Europeans come among them is due to 
their despair of ever succeeding, as the newcomers do, in the 
larger tasks of life. Old ways are broken and new ways not 
formed. ... 
A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: Seize the 
very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you 
make and on every emotional prompting you may experience in 
the direction of the habits you aspire to gain. It is not in the 
moment of their forming, but in the moment of their producing 
motor effects, that resolves and aspirations communicate the new 
“set” to the brain. 
No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and   
*This means, in our common expression: “Take your courage in your own hands and go ahead.” 2Motor Effects. When one’s new resolution is turned into appropriate action, then comes the new “set” to the brain.. One’s handwriting improves, not when he resolves to make it better, but when he actually writes a better hand. The resolution tends to be “set” in the brain, the habit tends to be formed by the appropriate action.
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 USEFUL HABITS OF WORK 
no matter how good one’s sentiments may be, if one have not 
taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to act, one’s 
character may remain entirely unaffected for the better. With 
mere good intentions hell is proverbially paved. . . . A tendency 
to act only becomes effectively ingrained in us in proportion to 
the uninterrupted frequency with which the actions actually 
occur, and the brain “grows” to their use. Every time a resolve 
or a fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing practical 
fruit is worse than a chance lost; it works so as positively to 
hinder future resolutions and emotions from taking the normal 
path of discharge. 
There is no more contemptible type of human character than 
that of the nerveless . . . dreamer, who spends his life in 
a weltering sea of emotion, but who never does a manly con- 
erete deed. Rousseau, inflaming all the mothers of France, 
by his eloquence, to follow Nature and nurse their babies them- 
selves, while he sends his own children to the foundling hospital, 
is the classical example of what I mean. . . . The weeping of a 
Russian lady over the fictitious personages in the play, while her 
coachman is freezing to death on his seat outside, is the sort of 
thing that everywhere happens on a less glaring scale. Even the 
habit of excessive indulgence in music, for those who are neither 
performers themselves nor musically gifted enough to take it in 
a purely intellectual way, has probably a relaxing effect upon 
the character. One becomes filled with emotions which habitually 
pass without prompting to any deed, and so the inertly senti- 
mental condition is kept up. The remedy would be never to 
suffer oneself to have an emotion at a concert without expressing 
_it afterward in some active way. Let the expression be the least 
thing in the world—speaking genially to one’s aunt, or giving 
up one’s seat in a horse car, if nothing more heroic offers—but 
let it not fail to take place. ... 
As a final practical maxim, relative to these habits of the will,

we may, then, offer something like this: Keep the faculty of 
effort alive in you by a little exercise every day. That is, be 
systematically heroic in little unnecessary points; do every day 
or two something for no other reason than that you would rather 
not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may 
find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test. Asceti- 
cism? of this sort is like the insurance which a man pays on his 
house and goods. The tax does him no good at the time, and 
possibly may never bring him a return. But if the fire does 
come, his having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with 
the man who has daily inured himself to habits of concentrated 
attention, . . . and self-denial in unnecessary things. He will 
stand like a tower when everything rocks around him, and when 
his softer fellow-mortals are winnowed like chaff in the blast. . . . 
Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere 
walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their 
conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning our own 
fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest 
stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little sear. The 
drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson’s play, excuses himself 
for every fresh dereliction by saying, “I won’t count this time!” 
Well! he may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; 
but it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve- 
cells and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering and 
storing it up to be used against him when the next temptation 
comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literalness, 
wiped out. 
Of course, this has its good side as well as its bad one. As 
we become permanent drunkards by so many separate drinks, 
so we become saints in the moral, and authorities and experts in 
the practical and scientific spheres, by so many separate acts and 
hours of work. Let no youth have any anxiety about the upshot 
of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If he keep 
faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely leave 
     14sceticism: practicing extreme rigor, or exceeding care.

the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count 
on waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the com- 
petent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have 
singled out. Silently, between all the details of his business, the 
power of judging in all that class of matter will have built itself 
up within him as a possession that will never pass away. Young 
people should know this truth in advance. The ignorance of it 
has probably engendered more discouragement and faint-heart- 
edness in youths embarking on arduous careers than all other 
causes put together. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Exercises 
1. Relate instances of habitual action similar to the acts of domestic 
animals and of men in prison, as told by James. 
2. Select ten of the most valuable concrete illustrations used by 
James. Discuss the value of such illustrations in making thought clear. 
3. Not all of the effects of habit as described by James in the fourth 
paragraph are beneficial. Make two lists from his illustrations; in one, 
place beneficial effects; in the other, the effects of the opposite kind. 
4. Habits of a certain order, like slow, painful reading of every word, 
may be beneficial in some situations and harmful in others. Similarly 
a reading habit of “skipping,” useful in certain reading problems, may 
be very harmful in others. Even a habit of persistent cheerfulness may 
sometimes be out of place. Unvarying sadness is extremely distress- 
ing. Certainly the facial habit of sourness or gloom, never changing, 
is always very irritating. An illuminating discussion might arise in 
your group upon the topics: 
(a) Good habits at the wrong time and place. 
(b) Is there a super-habit of sensibly adapting and modifying 
regular habits to varying emergencies? For example, 
the habit of never speaking critically of others; ought 
this habit ever to have exceptions? 
5. Whenever you apply to your own acquaintances the point James 
makes about habits of dress and appearance on page 95, you must use 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
THE FORMATION OF GOOD HABITS 101 
the greatest tact. In all probability you can furnish plenty of evidence 
to support Mr. James’s point. Recall, however, that habits are on vari- 
ous levels. One who is slovenly in dress may be habitually charitable; 
one whose English is habitually faulty may be master of worthy ideas. 
Often superficial habits outweigh, in our minds, the really substantial 
habits upon which merit must ultimately be judged. A class discussion 
on the issues raised in this paragraph might he profitable. 
6. It would be interesting to examine a play like Drinkwater’s Lin- 
coln to discover whether he has portrayed accurately the habits of 
American pioneer life. 
7. At the close of his article James speaks of the power of judging 
in one’s chosen field of work as the supreme mark of efficiency. Ex- 
plain how his point is in keeping with the theme of this book, that 
reading, thinking, and studying are closely related processes. 
8. For habits of the older days that are now out of fashion, someone 
might read Hamlin Garland’s A Son of the Middle Border, or his 
A Daughter of the Middle Border, accounts of life on the prairies of 
the Middle West, about the time your grandparents were children. 
What old-fashioned habits are described? 
9. What lies back of James’s recommendation that you “do every 
day or two something for no other reason than that you would rather 
not do it”? 
10. How might an athlete “make an enemy of his nervous system’? 
A draftsman? A high-school student? 
11. Appoint a committee to draw up a form for a daily or weekly 
work-schedule for members of your class. When the form is ready, 
Jet each one fill it out for himself. Volunteers may try following their 
schedules accurately for two weeks and report results. 
Projects 
A. Classify under four main divisions the following suggestions con- 
cerning study: I. Physical conditions of the study-room and of the 
student; II. Mental attitude toward study; III. The actual study proc- 
ess; IV. Supplementary suggestions. Add other sub-headings that may 
occur to you. Consult books in Additional Reading Projects, pages 
105-6. Under each main topic arrange the sub-heads in the order 
of increasing importance. Compare results by giving all your papers 
to a committee who may make one composite outline.

B. Imagine the audience of freshmen in Yale University listening to 
the paragraphs which follow. Dean Charles R. Brown, who is speaking, 
wants the boys to see for themselves, without being told in so many 
words, the value of forming certain habits. What habits did the boys 
evaluate as they heard these statements? 
THE NAME YOU BROUGHT’ 
Let me speak to you then this morning about names. In the first 
place, the name you brought with you has no particular significance. 
You inherited your surname from your father and grandfather. They 
may have borne it with honor and distinction. Even so, the light it 
shows when it comes to you is only a reflected light like that of the 
moon. Your Christian name, your “given name,” was bestowed upon 
you by the choice of your parents. It may not be at all to your liking. 
Many a fellow has been called Clarence or Percival who would much 
rather have been known as Jack or Sam. Let that be as it may—we 
have to take the hands which are dealt to us in this matter—the name 
you brought with you is like a sheet of paper on which you are privi- 
leged to write almost anything you like. It is “up to you,” as we say 
in our well-worn phrase, to give that name meaning. 
Forty-eight years ago a Freshman walked in here who gave his name 
as William Howard Taft. The name was not known then all around 
the world. It was merely a name given to him by a good family in 
Cincinnati, but not one in a hundred of his fellow students had ever 
heard of it before. He began right off to clothe that name with mean- 
ing. He was clean and straightforward in his mode of life. He was 
genial and likable—he made friends right and left. He was thorough 
and accurate in his scholarship, a Phi Beta Kappa man when the time 
eame. He was faithful in meeting the larger obligations of college life, 
showing even then a keen interest in the privileges and responsibilities 
which go with public service. He graduated with honors forty-four 
years ago. How much it means today when this question is addressed 
to him, “Tell me, I pray thee, thy name,” that he can answer back, 
“William Howard Taft.” Millions of people in all the lands of earth 
hold that name—the name of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
of the United States—in high esteem. And he made it so. 
Let me come down to more recent times! Some men may feel that 
anything which happened forty-eight years ago is ancient history, 
almost as remote as the Battle of Marathon. I am sure there was a 
time when I thought so. 
Four years ago another Freshman walked in. He had not come from 
an expensive, exclusive preparatory school—he came from a high school 
in a commonplace manufacturing town in Massachusetts. He was a

quiet, modest sort of fellow with none of the advantages which go with 
wealth and social position. He gave his name as Maleolm Aldrich, 
and he made that name a name to conjure with. His qualities of body, 
brain, and heart caused it to stand out. He became captain of the foot- 
ball team and captain of the baseball team because, without putting on 
any airs about it, he seemed to be able to play the game better than 
anybody else. He was a good student, and when he graduated he took 
honors. He was a high-minded Christian gentleman, and when the 
Seniors came to elect the six class deacons of the College Church a year 
ago, Aldrich was chosen. It did our souls good just to see him walking 
up and down the aisles of Battell Chapel with the bread and the wine 
of the Sacrament. He can go anywhere today among these eastern 
colleges and when anyone asks him, “What is thy name?” his answer 
carries meaning.

Reading Suggestions 
The article in this section constantly presents challenges. Again and 
again it throws the reader into a state of critical self-examination. In 
a very kindly way the writer, Mr. Dearborn, places squarely before aver- 
age men and women the faults of their own mental life. None of us 
can come away from a thoughtful reading of it without feeling humble. 
(1) Read first the opening and the closing paragraphs. 
(2) Read through the article very slowly, answering the problems 
printed in italics which follow the paragraphs to which they refer. 
Answer each problem in writing before you go further with the reading.     
           
  Every one of you has some kind of a thinker, for probably 
no feeble-minded person is reading this advice, and certainly 
no idiot; these have no thinkers. In some cases thinkers are 
small, and not now of much use. : These are the thinkers of 
the relatively stupid people. But they may be developed if 
there is will to develop them. In some cases thinkers are well 
developed, but rusty and dried out; these need a thorough 
cleaning and oiling and use. These are the lazy students. In 
some cases the thinkers have parts which are likely to break

down at any moment. These are the illogical minds and the 
guessers. In some cases thinkers are normal, but have the 
uncertain and difficult action of newness; they are not used 
nearly enough to make them run smoothly; they should be 
oiled with intelligence and energy. These are the average 
minds. Unused thinkers, like all other organs, tend to atrophy, 
and hardening through disuse is the result of inadequate action. 
On the other hand it is as delightful as it is useful to take sys- 
tematic mental exercise, and so to become an intellectual ath- 
lete. But how few can be made to realize this! The process 
of mental exercise as well as its product, is a continual delight, 
and is the most essential process in the mind’s action. 
Prostem. In which class is your thinker? 
The factors of education are more numerous than many sup- 
pose, each one requiring thought and teaching thought: the 
home, the schools, books, one’s associates, one’s vocation, the 
stage, travel, the state, the church—learning is a process of 
reaction to these nine. Each of the nine factors contributes 
material for learning which is valuable more or less in propor- 
tion to the thoughtfulness with which it is allowed to act on 
the learning mind. Learning, a process of activity of person- 
ality, develops in quality and quantity in proportion to the 
individual’s fitness and to the richness of his environment. In 
fact, thought is this reaction to one’s environment or part of it. 
This is an active receptivity; it is like the heat coming from a 
fire arising from oxygen and fuel—it is inevitable. Thought 
stands for INITIATIVE based on understanding and originality. 
ProsueM. Name one factor of school life which has recently 
required thinking on your part, and explain what you thought. 
William James has a famous passage, ‘top, look, and listen 
to your own minds. He refers to one of the secrets of learning 
to think, one which women have known instinctively all along. 
Set your thinker going by deliberate, fixed, permanent inten- 
tion, and then listen! Encourage it now and then by actively 
giving it full opportunity. Stop, in part, the stuffing of your 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  LEARNING TO THINK 109 
mind, and thus give it every possible opportunity to work. One 
feeds a furnace with coal to get heat from it, but some indi- 
viduals are forever putting facts into the minds but never pro- 
yiding time to use them in thought. 
ProsLeM. Name and discuss a school activity which may be 
likened to “stuffing” as contrasted with thinking. 
The nature of thought should receive brief attention. 
Thought is not reverie, musing, fancy, daydreaming; although 
most so-called ‘thought is just this, a loose associated train of 
ideas or notions or fancies. True thought is intimately of the 
nature of human reason; it is more precious, more productive— 
“sterner stuff’—than a more or less passive reverie, for it 
involves the expenditure of force. 
PROBLEM. Give an example of daydreaming when you 
should have been thinking. 
The most important element of thought is reasoning, which 
in principle is extremely simple. Reasoning is a comparison of 
things followed by an inference from the comparison. \ For 
example, compare study A which is easy for you with study B 
which is more difficult. You will find some one or more essen- 
tial differences; then by drawing an inference, or reasoning, 
you conclude that these differences are the causes of the diffi- 
eulty. This is thinking. It is what Lloyd Morgan has spoken 
of as “Thinking the therefore.” Thought, then, consists of 
two judgments: comparison and inference. 
Prostem. What studies may you compare? What is the 
inference you draw from the comparison? 
This is the essence of thought, and the most productive be- 
cause it alone produces something new. Ingenuity, originality, 
invention, and discovery often rest wholly on processes of infer- 
ring through comparisons. Six practical points about learning 
to think may be discussed briefly : ‘ 
First. The-realization of the necessity of thought and the 
delight of thought. The average young man or woman has no 
way of learning that what most counts is thought, initiative, 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 LEARNING TO THINK 
active imagination. Experience alone will prove this to him. 
Experience shows overwhelmingly that constructive thinking 
chiefly makes the difference between a life of wages and a life 
of salary. Everyone has more or less information, but only a 
few use it in thought, and so do things that are new, or do old 
things in new ways, the next best accomplishment. 
Prosiem. What is the value of “originals” in mathematics? 
Why is the very problem on which you are now working an 
“original”? 
Second. Development—of interests. The absolute necessity 
of interest for learning is frequently pointed out. The neces- 
sity is still surer for thought, true wisdom, real education. 
Develop interest in a subject, and your mind will think it out 
by association, by imagination, if given a chance, while you are 
doing something else. Such developed interests furnish the 
motive power for thinking. 
ProsteM. What are your own outstanding interests which 
determine how you think? 
Third. An abundance of clear ideas. Especially important 
are ideas of relationship. The relation to language is imme- 
diate here. Harvard College has recently made an extensive 
investigation tending to determine the relationship of the study 
of English along the line of intimate connection with our native 
intelligence. Ideas of relationship are especially essential; by 
their very nature they tend to develop comparisons and con- 
trasts; and their elaboration should be a systematic part of all 
schoolwork. The habit of the use of dictionaries of synonyms 
and antonyms is easily acquired; there is an amazing interest 
in the relations of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs—their 
qualities, what they do, and how. Books of synonyms and 
antonyms are valuable when the habit of using them has been 
acquired. Their use does much to develop thought as well as 
clearness of expression and literary style; they help the mind 
to work logically and systematically.

-P-A-G-E-111
  LEARNING TO THINK 111 
ProsteM. How does the statement that ideas of relation- 
ship are especially essential fall in line with the statement that 
thinking is essentially comparison and inference? 
Purely for emphasis it is worth repeating that words make up 
language and serve to connect it with the brain, and thereby 
with the remainder of the body and the rest of the world. Words 
are the quite indispensable handles of our human thinking, of 
our humanity itself. The closeness of this relation between lan- 
guage and thinking is worth strong emphasis, for its general 
educative importance is supreme. 
Propuem. Can you tell about one instance in which you 
experienced the satisfaction of exactly the right new word? 
Fourth. The habit of concentrated attention. This concen- 
tration should be for short periods along lines not disagreeable 
to the ability to think. Concentration sinks ideas more deeply 
into the brain; how, we know not. Conscious attention, how- 
ever exactly it may act, as that in discoveries and inventions, 
ean be concentrated properly for only short periods. Ideas 
stick best when they are impressed in periods of only thirty 
minutes, two or three times a day. We may use this as a rule 
for thinking; it means the importance of keeping the brain 
always rested. It is far more important than the saving of 
mere time. Muscles, especially the larger ones, may be fatigued 
without nervous harm (in fact this makes for sound sleep), but 
never the nerves. In the human brain there are nine thousand 
million nerve-units, which together weigh only a few grams; 
from this immense number may be seen how minute and subtly 
delicate they are; so do not fail to appreciate their liability to 
fatigue. Brain fatigue is a very real matter. At the same time 
the brain may be trained; one need not coddle it. Most people 
coddle their brains! 
ProsieM. Prove that you are resolutely concentrating at this 
very moment upon this lesson, by writing from memory Dear- 
born’s first, second, and third points about learning to think. 
Fifth. Habituation to the thinking process. Habit makes
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 LEARNING TO THINK 
thinking much easier than at first it appears to be, makes think- 
ing a continuous subconscious process. In order to acquire the 
thinking habit, other habits may have to be bent or sometimes 
even broken. (a) The general principle is that in proportion 
to the stability of the nervous system of the individual, accord- 
ing to age, sex, or vigor, habit may be suddenly bent down out 
of existence. (b) A second process of displacing a habit is 
keeping normally busy in everyday activity. And a third (c) 
is replacement of the undesirable habit with some other more 
useful habit. In general, students who are apt to read this 
article can break short off whatever habits conflict with the 
thinking or the study habit. 
ProsueEM. What one major habit ought you to break in 
order to study better? 
Siath. Opportunity for thought, in time and in solitude. 
Many of us are “too busy” with far less productive activities, 
really to live or really to think. We should make time, make 
solitude for thought. People are often too much continuously 
together. Each individual is separate, and requires individual 
separate thought. In general, one should in some way manage 
to spend considerable time alone. The gentle exercise of a 
stroll or of a slow bicycle ride requiring little attention to itself 
is an ideal occasion for thinking—unless the attention wanders 
too much outwardly. Schools are oftentimes too crowded to 
allow their students to think. One can afford as a matter of 
dollars and cents to take an extra year in school, if by doing 
so he ean learn to think; the time so used is a rich and certain 
investment. In default of better time, a half-hour after waking 
and before rising is a good time to think, and many people have 
their most productive and original thoughts occur to them thus 
in the early morning after a good night's rest. 
Prostem. When is your best time for studying? Your 
poorest? 
This advice to make thought-time at any cost is well-con- 
sidered advice, not an idle notion. It is wholly practical and
-P-A-G-E-113
LEARNING TO THINK 113 
expedient. It is, in fact, very often a matter of dollars and 
cents, and of advancement, not one only of developing one’s 
soul and personality, which much of the world has not yet 
learned to value. 
Rules for thinking are wholly unnecessary even to a young 
student. The normal human mind always knows how to think 
as part of its normality. Possibly no other animal knows how, 
but man knows how, and so do all normal boys and girls. The 
only explicit rule for thinking is: Acquire the habit. In plain 
language, laziness more than anything else prevents this habit 
of thought, for with all the interest and delight there is in 
learning to think, it is not always easy to become a thinker in 
this unresting world which never stops its hurry. Some really 
do not know how to think only because they have never tried 
to learn. The vast majority are simply too indolent to put their 
thinkers in order and to use them. And this is so, notwith- 
standing the fact that constructive mental action is a great 
delight as well as by far the most practically productive process 
of the mind. 
A few of my readers may here be “thinking” in annoyance, 
“T do not read this article to be accused of laziness.” No, in- 
deed, you do not, but some of you—perhaps you yourself—need 
to understand better how to learn easily; and for this purpose, 
one of the essential lessons to be learned is the utter incompati- 
bility of learning and indolence. Were it otherwise, learning 
would be of relatively little financial use, for every common 
‘ millionaire would be a thinker, and every tramp a millionaire.

Experiments in Studying and Thinking 
Every member of the class should try one of the first four; appoint a 
date for reports about two weeks later. 
1. Make an experiment: Put a solid half-hour of concentrated work 
on your hardest study, each morning before school. Try it faithfully 
for two weeks, and observe results. 
2. Try this as an alternative: Concentrate in your home-work upon 
your most difficult subject for exactly one hour at night before retiring. 
Allow fifteen minutes’ relaxation before going to bed. 
While at work keep this resolution in mind: 
“Tomorrow morning I will say over the most important parts of that 
lesson.” Then (here is the hard part) set your alarm clock fifteen min- 
utes before you usually get up. Wake up resolutely and while you are 
dressing go over aloud the parts of your lesson which you determined 
to review. Try this for two weeks, and observe results. 
3. You might experiment with this: For two weeks use every minute 
of your study periods in school. Do not waste a second. Then, either 
before dinner or after, as most convenient, take a walk alone, where 
you will meet no one you know, and talk over with yourself the impor- 
tant information and the meaning of the lessons studied in school. 
4. Have you a regular task at home, like washing dishes, or mak- 
ing beds, er tending fires? For two weeks while you are doing this 
task use the time in thinking over the work of one of your school 
study periods. First, ask questions of yourself, and answer them aloud. 
Second, tie up the lesson with ones that have preceded. Third, think 
of practical applications you might make. Fourth, try to state in exact 
words any difficulties you encounter. Fifth, phrase questions about the 
lesson as you would ask them if tomorrow you were to take the place 
of the teacher. Sixth, plan how as the teacher you might otherwise use 
the class hour to serve your group most efficiently. 
5. Plan a series of experiments with the length of your own study 
periods. Find the length of period of concentrated attention which 
seems to give you the best results.

HOW WE REASON 
TU. cc. oycreast ater og tere 
   When we examine the mental processes by which we think 
constructively, or, in other words, reason, we find first of all 
that there is recognition of a problem to be solved. When we 
start to reason, we do so because we find ourselves in a situa- 
tion from which we must extricate ourselves. The situation 
may be physical, as when our automobile stops suddenly on a 
country road; or it may be mental, as when we are deciding 
what college to attend. In both cases, we recognize that we are 
facing a problem which must be solved. 
After recognition of the problem, our next step is to start 
vigorous efforts to solve it. In doing this, we cast about for 
means; we summon all the powers at our disposal. In the case 
of the automobile, we call to mind other accidents and the 
causes of them; we remember that once the spark-plug played

  116 LEARNING TO THINK 
out, so we test this hypothesis. At another time some dust got 
into the carburetor, so we test this. Thus we go on, calling up 
possible causes and applying appropriate remedies until the 
right one is found and the engine is started. 
In bringing to bear upon the problem facts from our past 
experience, we form a series of judgments. In the case of the 
problem as to what college to attend, we might form these 
judgments: this college is nearer home; that one has a cele- 
brated faculty; this one has good laboratories; that one is my 
father’s Alma Mater. So we might go on, bringing up all the 
facts regarding the problem and fitting each one mentally to 
see how it works. 
Note that this utilization of ideas should not consist merely 
of fumbling about in a vague hope of hitting upon some solu- 
tion. It must be a systematic search, guided by carefully 
chosen ideas. For example, if the clock on the mantelpiece 
has stopped, and having no idea how to make it go again, we 
mildly shake it in the hope that something will happen to set 
it going, we are merely fumbling. But if, on moving the clock 
gently, we hear the pendulum wobbling about irregularly, and 
at the same time observe that there is no ticking of any kind, 
and come to the conclusion that the pendulum has somehow or 
other eseaped the little catch that connects it with the mecha- 
nism, we have been really thinking. From the fact that the 
pendulum wobbles irregularly, we infer that it has lost its 
proper eatch. From the fact that there is no ticking, we infer 
the same thing, for even when there is something wrong with 
the clock that will prevent it from going permanently, if the 
pendulum is set in motion by force from without, it will tick 
for a few seconds before it comes to rest again. The important 
point to observe is that there must be inference. This is always 
indicated by the word therefore or its equivalent. If you reach 
a conclusion without having to use or at any rate to imply a 
therefore, you may take it for granted that you have not been 
really thinking, but only jumping to conclusions. 
This process of putting facts in the form of judgments and 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  HOW WE REASON 117 
drawing inferences may be likened to a court-room scene where 
arguments are presented to the judge. As each bit of evidence 
is submitted, it is subjected to the test of its applicability to 
the situation or to similar situations in the past. It is rigidly 
examined, and nothing is accepted as a candidate for the solu- 
tion until it is found by trial (of course, in imagination) to be 
pertinent to the situation. 
The third stage of the reasoning process comes when some 
plan which has been suggested as a possible solution of the 
difficulty proves effective, and we make the decision; the argu- 
ments support or overthrow each other, adding to and eliminat- 
ing various considerations until finally only one course appears 
possible. As we said before, the solution comes inevitably, as 
represented by the word therefore. Little active work on our 
part is necessary, for if we have gone through these other 
phases properly, the decision will make itself. You cannot 
make a wrong decision if you have the facts before you and 
have given each the proper weight. When the solution comes 
it is recognized as right, for it comes tinged with a feeling that 
we call belief. 
Now that we have found the reasoning process to be one of 
problem-solving, of which the first step is to acknowledge and 
recognize the difficulty, the second, to call up various methods 
of solution, and the third, to decide on the basis of one of the 
solutions that comes tinged with certainty, we are ready to apply 
this scheme to study in the hope that we may discover the 
causes and remedies for the reasoning difficulties of students. 
In view of the fact that reasoning starts out with a problem, 
you see at once that to make your study effective you must 
study in problems. Avoid an habitual attitude of mere acqui- 
sition.1_ Do not memorize facts in the same pattern as they are 
  
1“A reading machine, always wound up and going, 
He mastered whatever was not worth the knowing; 
’Twould be endless to tell you the things that he knew, 
All separate facts, undeniably true, 
But with him or each other they'd nothing to do, 
No power of combining, arranging, discerning, Digested the masses he learned into learning.” 
Lowrun, A Fable for Critics.  
-P-A-G-E-118
    118 LEARNING TO THINK 
handed out to you. In history, in general literature, in science, 
do not read facts merely as they come in the text, but seek the 
relations between them. Voluntarily set before yourself intel- 
leetual problems. Ask yourself, why is this so? In other 
words, in your study do not merely acquire, but also construct. 
Acquisition makes use mostly of memory and though your 
memorizing be done ever so conscientiously, if it comprise the 
main part of your study, you fail to utilize your mind to its 
fullest extent. 
Let us now consider the second stage of the reasoning process 
as found in study. At this stage the facts in the mind are 
brought forward for the purpose of being fitted into the present 
situation, and the essential thing is that you have a large number 
of facts at your disposal. If you are going to reason effectively 
about problems in history, mathematics, geography, it is abso- 
lutely indispensable that you know many facts about the sub- 
jects. One reason why you experience difficulty in reasoning 
about certain subjects is that you do not know enough about 
them. 
The results of such ignorance are often demonstrated in polit- 
ical and social movements. Why do the masses so easily fall vic- 
tims to doubtful reforms in national and municipal policies? Be- 
cause they do not know enough about these matters to reason 
intelligently. Watch ignorant people listening to a demagogue 
and see what unreasonable things they accept. The speaker pro- 
pounds a question and then proceeds to answer it in his own 
way. He makes it appear plausible, assuring his hearers it is the 
only way, and they agree because they do not have enough other 
facts at their command to refute it. They are unable, as we say, 
to see the situation in several aspects. 
The mistakes in reasoning which children make have a similar 
basis. The child reaches for the moon, reasoning, “Here is 
something bright; I can touch most bright things; therefore, I 
ean touch this.” His reasoning is fallacious because he does 
not have all the facts. This condition is paralleled in the class-
-P-A-G-E-119
     
HOW WE REASON 119 
room when students make what are shamefacedly looked back 
upon as miserable blunders. When one of these fiascos occurs, 
the cause can many times be referred to the fact that the student 
did not have enough facts at his command. Speaking broadly, 
the most effective reasoning in a field can be done by one who 
has had the most extensive experiences in that field. If one had 
complete acquaintance with all facts, one would have perfect 
conditions for reasoning. Thus we see that effectiveness in 
reasoning demands an extensive array of facts. Accordingly, 
in your courses of study you must read with avidity. When you 
are given a list of readings in a course, some of which are 
required and some optional, read both sets, and every new fact 
thus secured will make you better able to reason in the field. 
But good reasoning demands more than mere quantity of ideas. 
The ideas must conform to certain qualitative standards before 
they may be effectively employed in reasoning. They must arise 
with promptness, in an orderly manner, pertinent to the matter 
in hand, and they must be clear. In securing promptness of 
association on the part of your ideas, employ the methods de- 
seribed in the chapter on Memory.'' Make many logical associa- 
tions with clearness and repetition. In order to insure the rise 
of ideas in an orderly manner, pay attention to the manner in 
which you acquire them. Remember, things will be recalled as 
they were impressed, so the value of your ideas in reasoning 
will depend upon the manner in which you make original im- 
pressions. 2 
A further characteristic of serviceable ideas is clarity. Ideas 
are sometimes described as “clear” in opposition to “muddy.” 
You know what is meant by these distinctions, and you may be 
assured that one cause for your failures in reasoning is that your 
ideas are not clear. This manifests itself in inability to make 
elear statements and to comprehend clearly, The latter condition 
is easily illustrated. When you began the study of geometry 
you faced a multitude of new terms; we call them technical 
  
iMemory: See discussion on pages 169-174. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
120 LEARNING TO THINK 
terms, such as projection, scalene, theory of limits. These had 
to be clearly understood before you could reason in the subject. 
And when, in the progress of your study, you experienced diffi- 
culty in reasoning out problems, it was very likely due to the 
fact that you did not master the technical terms, and as soon as 
you encountered the difficulties of the course, you failed because 
your foundation-laying did not involve the acquisition of clear 
ideas, Examine your difficulties in reasoning subjects and if you 
find them traceable to vagueness of ideas, take steps to clarify 
your ideas. 
Ideas may be clarified in two ways: by definition and by 
classification. Definition is a familiar device, for you have had 
much to do with it in learning. The memorization of definitions 
is an excellent practice, not as an end in itself, but as a means 
to the end of effective reasoning. Throughout your study, then, 
pay much attention to definitions. You will find some in your 
texts, but you will have to make others for yourself. In order 
to get practice in this, undertake the manufacture of a few 
definitions, using terms such as charity or benevolence. This ex- 
ercise will reveal what an exacting mental operation definition 
is and will prove how vague most of your thinking really is. 
A large stock of definitions will help you to think rapidly. 
Standing as they do for a large group of experiences, definitions 
are a means of mental economy. For illustration of their service 
in reasoning, suppose you were asked to compare the serf, the 
peon, and the American slave. If you have a clean-cut definition 
of each of these terms, you can readily distinguish between 
them, but if you cannot define them, you will hardly be able to 
reason concerning them. 
Another means of clarifying ideas is classification. By this 
is meant the process of grouping similar ideas or similar points 
of ideas. For example, your ideas of serf, peon, and slave 
have some points in common. Group the ideas, then, with refer- 
ence to these points. Then in reasoning you can quickly place 
an idea in its proper group.
-P-A-G-E-121
HOW WE REASON 121 
The third stage of the reasoning process is degision, based on 
belief, and it comes inevitably, provided the other two processes 
have been performed rightly. Accordingly, we need say little 
about its place in study. One caution should be pointed out in 
making decisions. Do not make them hastily on the basis of 
only one or two facts. Wait until you have canvassed all the 
ideas that bear importantly upon the case. The masses who 
listen eagerly to the demagogue do not err merely from lack 
of ideas, but partly because they do not utilize all the facts at 
their disposal. This fault is frequently discernible in impulsive 
people, who notoriously make snap judgments, which means that 
they decide before canvassing all the evidence. This trait marks 
the fundamental difference between superficial and profound 
thinkers. The former accept surface facts and decide immedi- 
ately, while the latter refuse to decide until after canvassing 
many facts. 
In the improvement of reasoning ability your task is mainly 
one of habit formation. It is necessary, first, to form the habit 
of stating things in the form of problems; second, to form habits 
by which ideas arise promptly and profusely; third, to form 
habits of reserving decisions until the important facts are in. 
These are all specific habits that must be built up if the reasoning 
processes of the mind are to be effective. Already you have 
formed some habits— 
If not habits of careful looking into things, then habits of 
hasty, heedless, impatient glancing over the surface; if not 
habits of consecutively following up the suggestions that occur, 
then habits of haphazard, grasshopper-like guessing; if not 
habits of suspending judgment until inferences have been tested 
by the examination of evidence, then habits of credulity alter- 
nating with flippant incredulity, belief or unbelief being based 
in either case upon whim, emotion, or accidental circumstances. 
The only way to achieve traits of carefulness and thoroughness 
is by exercising these traits from the beginning, and by seeing 
to it that conditions call for their exercise. 
Apply the principles of habit formation already enunciated,      
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 LEARNING TO THINK 
and remember that with every act of reasoning you perform, 
you are molding yourself into a careless reasoner or an accurate 
reasoner, into a clear thinker or a muddy thinker. 
This discussion shows that reasoning is one of the highest 
powers of man. It is a mark of originality and intelligence, and 
stamps its possessor not a copier but an originator, not a follower 
but a leader, not a slave, to have his thinking foisted upon him 
by others, but a free and independent intellect, unshackled by the 
bonds of ignorance and convention. The man who employs 
reason in acquiring knowledge finds delights in study that are 
denied to a rote memorizer. When one looks at the world through 
glasses of reason, inquiring into the eternal why, then facts take 
on a new meaning, knowledge comes with new power, the facts 
of experience glow with vitality, and one’s own relations with 
them appear in a new light.

(b) A lesson in which you examined, and tried to understand

(c) A project in which you yourself did some original thinking; 
that is, recognized and stated a problem, devised plans, 
and made a decision. Example: Forming a literary 
society, or a dramatic club. Cite another example. 
4. Go through a portion—say fifty pages—of the last textbook you 
used in literature, in civies, history, or community life. Find problems 
set forth in those pages which actually involved reasoning. Find oth- 
ers which were memory questions. 
5. Think over your last week’s work in school. Recall the chief rea- 
soning situation in which you found yourself in mathematics, in 
seience, in French or any other language, and relate this to the class. 
6. Mr. Kitson urges you to set yourself intellectual problems, not 
merely to read and remember facts set forth in the text. Can you 
name one or more such problems you set for yourself in reading Kit- 
son’s article? 
7. If you can, test yourself without turning back: What is Kit- 
son’s point about the basis for mistakes in reasoning? What are his 
two chief illustrations? Give an illustration of your own. Why are 
schools for the masses an important element in the life of a democracy? 
8. Try to recount an act of reasoning of your own which was 
ineffective because you were deficient in one of these four essentials of 
good reasoning: 
(a) A sufficient quantity of ideas. 
(b) A prompt command of those ideas. 
(c) Ideas pertinent to the problem. 
(d) Ideas clear and orderly in arrangement.

9. In the light of Kitson’s distinction between “clear” and “muddy” 
ideas, page 119, comment upon the answer, often heard in our eclass- 
rooms, “I know, but I don’t know how to explain it.” 
10. Kitson says that ideas may be clarified by definition and by 
elassification : 
(a) “Undertake the manufacture” of a definition of one of 
these terms: charity, study, handwork, good looks, civic 
pride, subway, traffic regulation, school spirit, ambition. 
(b) “Undertake” to line up or classify your available stock of 
ideas that would group themselves under one of the 
following: 
(1) Convenient kinds of transportation. 
(2) Safety regulations in our city. 
(3) Provisions for public recreation. 
(4) Advantages in return for taxation. 
(5) The best tests of friendship. 
(6) What makes school experiences valuable. 
11. An eleventh-grade class in a Chicago high school brought in 
various oral reports upon the problem: Give an example which shows 
the importance of reserving a decision until you know the facts (Kit- 
son, page 121). One girl told this experience: She lived with her 
parents in a large apartment hotel. Frequently they sat at the same 
dining-room table with a Mr. and Mrs. Blank, who often spoke proudly 
of a twenty-one-year-old son. The girl and her mother had never seen 
the young man. One day in 1918 he came home, and to their utter 
surprise, the boy was not the handsome, strong, gentle, courteous youth 
his mother had described. He was sickly, sullen, morose, disagreeable. 
The young lady and her mother concluded that parents are often blind 
to the true nature of their children. 
They continued in this belief for two days. Then the boy’s mother 
told them, “You know John is not as he was. He was shot through 
the lungs at Chateau-Thierry, and gassed at the same time. He hasn’t 
long to live, and has come home to die.” 
Said the young woman: “Mother and I made our decision before the 
facts were all in.” 
Try the same topic in your class: A case in which I failed to reserve 
my decision until the facts were all in.

THE ANALYSIS OF A COMPLETE ACT OF THOUGHT?!

Reading Problem 
Study this selection to get a better understanding of what thinking 
is. Note carefully the short paragraph at the beginning. It is the sign- 
post paragraph, pointing the way for the rest of the article. During 
your second reading memorize the five distinct steps in reflection 
named in this paragraph, and remember how each step goes back for its 
illustrations to the three examples stated in the beginning. 
In this chapter we shall make an analysis of the process of 
thinking into its steps or elementary constituents, basing the 
analysis upon descriptions of a number of extremely simple, but 
genuine, cases of reflective experience.” 
(1) The other day when I was down town on 16th Street a 
clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20. 
This suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street at 
one o’clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come 
down on a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late 
if I returned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a 
subway express. But was there a station near? If not, I might 
lose more than twenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought 
of the elevated, and I saw there was such a line within two blocks. | 
But where was the station? If it were several blocks above or 
below the street I was on, I should lose time instead of gaining it. 
My mind went back to the subway express as quicker than the 
elevated; furthermore, I remembered that it went nearer than 
the elevated to the part of 124th Street I wished to reach, so that

time would be saved at the end of the journey. I concluded in 
favor of the subway, and reached my destination by one o’clock. 
(2) Projecting nearly horizontally from the upper deck of 
the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long white 
pole, bearing a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole when 
I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with this 
idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But 
soon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly 
horizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place, 
there was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; 
finally, there were elsewhere two vertical staffs from which flags 
were occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was 
not there for flag-fiying. 
I then tried to imagine all possible purposes of such a pole, 
and to consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Pos- 
sibly it was an ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the 
tugboats carried like poles, this hypothesis was rejected. (6b) 
Possibly it was the terminal of a wireless telegraph. But the 
same considerations madé this improbable. Besides, the more 
natural place for such a-tefminal would be the highest part of 
the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its purpose might be to 
point out the direction in which the boat is moving. 
In support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was 
lower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see 
it. Moreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, 
from the pilot’s position, it must appear to project far out in 
front of the boat. Moreover, the pilot, being near the front of 
the boat, would need some such guide as to its direction. Tug- 
boats would also need poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis 
was so much more probable than the others:that I accepted it. 
I formed the conclusion that the pole was set up for the purpose 
of showing the pilot the direction in which the boat pointed, to 
enable him to steer correctly. 
(3) In washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and placing them 
mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the outside of 
the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The 
presence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from 
inside the tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate pre- 
vents escape of the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But 
why should air leave the tumbler? There was no substance en- 
tering to force it out. It must have expanded. It expands by 
increase of heat or by decrease of pressure, or by both. Could

-P-A-G-E-128
128 LEARNING TO THINK 
the air have become heated after the tumbler was taken from the 
hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already entangled in the 
water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must have entered 
in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate. I test 
to see if this supposition is true by taking several more tumblers 
out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air in 
them. Some I take out, holding mouth downward in order to 
prevent cold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside 
of every one of the former and on none of the latter. I must be 
right in my inference. Air from the outside must have been 
expanded by the heat of the tumbler, which explains the appear- 
ance of the bubbles on the outside. 
But why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler 
eooled and also the air inside it. Tension was removed, and 
hence bubbles appeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by 
placing a cup of ice on the tumbler while the bubbles are still 
forming outside. They soon reverse. 
These three cases have been purposely selected so as to form a 
series from the more rudimentary to the more complicated cases 
of reflection. The first illustrates the kind of thinking done by 
everyone during the day’s business, in which neither the data, 
nor the ways of dealing with them, take one outside the limits of 
everyday experience. The last furnishes a case in which neither 
problem nor mode of solution would have been likely to oceur 
except to one with some prior scientific training. The second 
ease forms a natural transition ; its materials lie well within the 
bounds of everyday, unspecialized experience; but the problem, 
instead of being directly involved in the person’s business, arises 
indirectly out of his activity, and accordingly appeals to a some- 
what theoretic and impartial interest. Here we are concerned 
only with the common elements of thinking found in all the 
types. 
Upon examination, each instance reveals, more or less clearly, 
five logically distinct steps: (7) a felt difficulty; (i) its location 
and definition ; (iii) suggestion of possible solution; (iv) devel- 
opment by reasoning of the bearings of the suggestion; (v) 
further observation and experiment leading to its acceptance or 
rejection; that is, the conclusion of belief or disbelief. 
A

(1) The first and second steps frequently fuse into one. The 
difficulty may be felt with sufficient definiteness as to set the mind 
at once speculating upon its probable solution, or an undefined 
uneasiness and shock may come first, leading only later to definite 
attempt to find out what is the matter. Whether the two steps 
are distinct or blended, there is the factor emphasized in our 
original account of reflection—viz.: the perplexity or problem.: 
In the first of the three cases cited, the difficulty resides in 
the conflict between conditions at hand and a desired and in- 
tended result, between an end and the means for reaching it. 
The purpose of keeping an engagement at a certain time, and the 
existing hour taken in connection with the location, are not con- 
gruous. The object of thinking is to introduce congruity between 
the two. The given conditions cannot themselves be altered ; time 
will not go backward nor will the distance between 16th Street 
and 124th Street shorten itself. The problem is the discovery of 
intervening terms which when inserted between the remoter end 
and the given means will harmonize them with each other. 
In the second case, the difficulty experienced is the incompat- 
ibility of a suggested and (temporarily) accepted belief that the 
pole is a flagpole, with ceftain other facts. Suppose we sym- 
bolize the qualities that suggest flagpole. by the letters a, b, c; 
those that oppose this suggestion by the letters p, q, r. There 
is, of course, nothing inconsistent in the qualities themselves. 
But in pulling the mind to different and incongruous conclusions 
they conflict—hence the problem. Here the object is the dis- 
covery of some object (O), of which a, b, c, and p, q, 7, may all 
be appropriate traits—just as, in our first case, it is to discover 
a course of action which will combine existing conditions and a 
remoter result in a single whole. The method of solution is also 
the same: discovery of intermediate qualities (the position of 
the pilot house, of the pole, the need of an index to the boat’s 
direction) symbolized by d, g, 1, which bind together otherwise 
incompatible traits. 
(in the third case, an observer trained to the idea of natural 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    130 LEARNING TO THINK 
laws or uniformities finds something odd or exceptional in the 
behavior of the bubbles. The problem is to reduce the apparent 
anomalies to instances of well-established laws. Here the method 
of solution is also to seek for intermediary terms which will con- 
nect, by regular linkage, the seemingly extraordinary movements 
of the bubbles with the conditions known to follow from processes 
supposed to be operative. 
(2) As already noted, the first two steps, the feeling of a 
difficulty, and the acts of observation that serve to define the 
character of the difficulty may, in a given instance, telescope 
together. In cases of striking novelty or unusual perplexity, the 
difficulty, however, is likely to present itself at first as a shock, 
as an emotional disturbance, as a more or less vague feeling of the 
unexpected, of something queer, strange, funny, or disconcerting. 
In such instances, there are necessary observations deliberately 
ealeulated to bring to light just what is the trouble, or to make 
clear the specific character of the problem. In large measure, 
the existence or non-existence of this step makes the difference 
between reflection proper, or safeguarded critical inference, and 
uncontrolled thinking. Where sufficient pains to locate the diffi- 
culty are not taken, suggestions for its resolution must be more or 
less random. Imagine a doctor called in to prescribe for a 
patient. The patient tells him some things that are wrong; his 
experienced eye, at a glance, takes in other signs of a certain 
disease. But if he permits the suggestion of this special disease 
to take possession prematurely of his mind, to become an accepted 
conclusion, his scientific thinking is by that much cut short. A 
large part of his technique, as a skilled practitioner, is to prevent 
the acceptance of the first suggestions that arise; even, indeed, to 
postpone the occurrence of any very definite suggestion till the 
trouble—the nature of the problem—has been thoroughly ex- 
plored. In the case of a physician this proceeding is known as 
diagnosis, but a similar inspection is required in every novel and 
complicated situation to prevent rushing to a conclusion. The 
essence of critical thinking is suspended judgment; and the
-P-A-G-E-131
  ANALYSIS OF AN ACT OF THOUGHT 131 
essence of this suspense is inquiry to determine the nature of 
the problem before proceeding to attempts at its solution. This, 
more than any other thing, transforms mere inference into tested 
inference, suggested conclusions into proof. 
(3) The third factor is suggestion. The situation in which 
the perplexity occurs calls up something not present to the 
senses: the present location, the thought of subway or elevated 
train; the stick before the eyes, the idea of a flagpole, an orna- 
ment, an apparatus for wireless telegraphy; the soap bubbles, 
the law of expansion of bodies through heat and of their 
contraction throvgh cold. (a) Suggestion is the very heart of 
inference; it involves going from what is present to something 
absent. Hence, it is more or less speculative, adventurous. Since 
inference goes beyond what is actually present, it involves a leap, 
a jump, the propriety of which cannot be absolutely warranted 
in advance, no matter what precautions be taken. Its control is 
indirect, on the one hand, involving the formation of habits of 
mind which are at once enterprising and cautious; and on the 
other hand, involving the selection and arrangement of the par- 
ticular facts upon perception of which suggestion issues. (b) 
The suggested conclusion so far as it is not accepted, but only 
tentatively entertained, constitutes an idea. Synonyms for this 
are supposition, conjecture, guess, hypothesis, and (in elaborate 
eases) theory. Since suspended belief, or the postponement of 
a final conclusion pending further evidence, depends partly upon 
the presence of rival conjectures as to the best course to pursue 
or the probable explanation to favor, cultivation of a variety 
of alternative suggestions is an important factor in good 
thinking. 
(4) The process of developing the bearings—or, as they are 
more technically termed, the implications—of any idea with © 
respect to any problem, is termed reasoning.' As an idea is in- 
  
2This term is sometimes extended to denote the entire reflective process—just as inference (which in the sense of test is best reserved for the third step) is sometimes used in the same broad sense. But reasoning seems to be peculiarly adapted to express what the older writers called the “notional” or “dialectic” process of developing the meaning of a given idea. 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 LEARNING TO THINK 
ferred from given facts, so reasoning sets out from an idea. The 
idea of elevated road is developed into the idea of difficulty of 
locating station, length of time occupied on the journey, distance 
of station at the other end from place to be reached. In the 
second case, the implication of a flagpole is seen to be a vertical 
position ; of a wireless apparatus, location on a high part of the 
ship and, moreover, absence from every casual tugboat; while 
the idea of index to direction in which the boat moves, when 
developed, is found to cover all the details of the case. 
Reasoning has the same effect upon a suggested solution as 
more intimate and extensive observation has upon the original 
problem. Acceptance of the suggestion in its first form is pre- 
vented by looking into it more thoroughly. Conjectures that 
seem plausible at first sight are often found unfit or even absurd 
when their full consequences are traced out.. Even when reason- 
ing out the bearings of a supposition does not lead to rejection, it 
develops the idea into a form in which it is more apposite to the 
problem. Only when, for example, the conjecture that a pole was 
an index-pole had been thought out into its bearings, could its 
particular applicability to the case in hand be judged. Sugges- 
tions at first seemingly remote and wild are frequently so trans- 
formed by being elaborated into what follows from them as to 
become apt and fruitful. The development of an idea through 
reasoning helps at least to supply the intervening or interme- 
diate terms that link together into a consistent whole apparently 
discrepant extremes. 
(5) The concluding and conclusive step is some kind of 
experimental corroboration, or verification, of the conjectural 
idea. Reasoning shows that if the idea be adopted, certain con- 
sequences will follow. So far the conclusion is hypothetical or 
conditional. If we look, and find present all the conditions de- 
manded by the theory, and if we find the characteristic traits 
ealled for by rival alternatives to be lacking, the tendency to 
believe, to accept, is almost irresistible. Sometimes direct obser- 
vation furnishes corroboration, as in the case of the pole on the 
boat. In other cases, as in that of the bubbles, experiment is
-P-A-G-E-133
ANALYSIS OF AN ACT OF THOUGHT 133 
required; that is, conditions are deliberately arranged in accord 
with the requirements of an idea or hypothesis to see if the results 
theoretically indicated by the idea actually occur. If it is found 
that the experimental results agree with the theoretical results, 
and if there is reason to believe that only the conditions in ques- 
tion would yield such results, the confirmation is so strong as to 
induce a conclusion—at least until contrary facts shall indicate 
the advisability of its revision. 
Observation exists at the beginning and again at the end of 
the process: at the beginning, to determine more definitely and 
precisely the nature of the difficulty to be dealt with; at the 
end, to test the value of some hypothetically entertained con- 
clusions. Between those two termini of observation, we find the 
more distinctively mental aspects of the entire thought-cycle: 
(a) inference, the suggestion of an explanation or solution; and 
‘(b) reasoning, the development of the bearings and implications 
of the suggestion. Reasoning requires some experimental ob- 
servation to confirm it, while experiment can be economically 
and fruitfully conducted only on the basis of an idea that has 
been tentatively developed by reasoning. 
The disciplined, or logically trained, mind—the aim of the 
educative process—is the mind_able to judge how far each of 
these steps needs to be carried in_any particular situation, No 
cast-iron rules can be laid down. Each case has to. be dealt with 
as it arises, on the basis of its importance and of the context in 
which it oceurs. To take too much pains in one case is as foolish 
—as illogical—as to take too little in another. At one extreme, 
almost any conclusion that insures prompt and unified action 
may be better than any long-delayed conclusion; while at the 
other, decision may have to be postponed for a long period— 
perhaps for a lifetime. The trained mind is the one that best 
grasps the degree of observation, forming of ideas, reasoning, and 
experimental testing required in any special case, and that profits 
the most, in future thinking, by mistakes made in the past. What 
is important is that the mind should be sensitive to problems and 
skilled in methods of attack and solution.

Problems to Be Worked Out in the Classroom 
1. Explain each of the five steps in a complete act of thought: (a) 
a difficulty felt, (b) its location and definition, (c) suggestion of pos- 
sible solution, (d) development by reasoning of the bearings of the 
suggestion; (e) further observation and experiment leading to its 
acceptance or rejection. Use examples by referring to a problem of 
your own. 
2. See how quickly you can locate in the discussions of Kitson, of 
Dearborn, and of Dewey the respective passages which insist upon an 
abundance of clear ideas as an essential element of good thinking. 
3. Why is it better to recall-Mr. Dewey’s explanation in terms of a 
situation of your own, rather than to recall the experiences he recounts? 
4, A felt difficulty: its location and definition. A party was making 
a trip by auto from Chicago to Champaign to witness a game of foot- 
ball between two universities. The last twenty miles led through a 
stretch of wretched country road. After 1634 miles of this, when the 
party was within sight of the hard road which led for three miles into 
Champaign, the car gently but irresistibly slipped into a ditch and 
stuck fast. It was 12:30; the game began at 2:00. The difficulty, 
its location, and definition are obvious. 
Relate a similar setting for some thinking problem which has come 
your way. 
5. The difference between uncontrolled thinking and critical in- 
ference. Mr. Dewey’s suggestion is diagnosis, in contrast with mere 
fluttering around. Imagine the diagnosis the driver of the car might 
make. Imagine, too, what a flutterer would do under similar circum- 
stances. If you prefer, do this with the situation you have described 
in 1 or 4 
6. An hypothesis: some proposal, or a series of proposals for a way 
out of a difficulty. We have a slang expression which indicates that 
a man is “a good guesser.” We do not mean a man who makes a lucky 
draw in a lottery, or who, blindfolded, can light by chance upon a 
solution of a parlor problem. <A good guesser is the one who in the 
face of emergency can instantly, or upon reflection, bring into his mind 
one or several possible alternatives for action. With facility he rejects 
this and that alternative, and seemingly by instinct, but really by keen

intelligence, decides upon a sensible method of procedure. Dewey has 
this in mind when he says: 
The most important factor in the training of good mental habits 
consists in acquiring the attitude of suspended conclusion and in mas- 
tering the various methods of searching for new materials to corroborate 
or to refute the first suggestions that occur. To maintain the state of 
doubt and to carry on systematic and protracted inquiry—these are 
the essentials of thinking. 
Think of some hypotheses which have been set up and proved by men 
in science. See the example in McMurry, Chapter I, page 23. Your 
textbooks in science contain plenty of them. Think of a guess which 
you made that did not prove correct. Why? What were the alternatives? 
7. An old definition of education runs: “Education is the organiza- 
tion of power of successful behavior in view of differing emergencies.” 
How does this find support in Mr. Dewey’s discussion? & t 
8. Experimental corroboration. Think of the various useless hy- 
potheses which the man with his car in the ditch might consider ahd so 
make his party miss the game. Think of a few with which he might 
briefly experiment. Recalling a like experience of your own, and 
assuming that his car was in the same straits yours was, what was the 
best hypothesis to test out if he wanted to see the game? men 
9. Write out your choice of the following: yn neo — RA 
  (a) A simple case of practical deliberation of your own. 
(b) A simple case of reflection upon an observation. 
(c) A simple case of reflection involving experiment. 
When these are read to the class, let the discussion determine whether 
you have described a case that clearly falls within the division you have 
named. 
10. “The mind should be sensitive to problems and skilled in methods 
of attack and solution” (page 133). Apply this principle to: 
(a) Distinguishing between good poetry and doggerel. 
(b) Repairing a faulty radio apparatus. 
(c) Improving one’s skill in playing any game. 
(da) Revising and improving a written exercise. 
(e) Ridding one’s speech of slang.

TWO RELATED KINDS OF THINKING 
MeMurry says! that the investigations into the cause of yel- 
low fever employed two different kinds of thinking, called induc- 
tion and deduction. These are types of thinking differing from 
each other, and at the same time closely related to each other, 
which everyone should understand. 
I. THE MEANING OF THE TWO WORDS 
Induction comes from two Latin words, in and duco, which 
mean respectively in and lead; induction, then, is a leading in. 
Obviously, deduction, coming from de and duco, means similarly 
a leading out.

an intelligent guess, an hypothesis, as to the cause of yellow 
fever. In short, the cause of yellow fever was determined 
experimentally by inductive thinking. Thus in science labora- 
tories the inductive processes are used for the discovery of new 
truth. 
But, as Dr. MeMurry suggests on page 23, the hypothesis 
had to be very widely and repeatedly tested, in order that the 
investigators might be positive that the right cause had been

found. We may therefore picture the testing processes as fol- 
lows: 
      
        
        
  Yellow 
“Fever

  Here we have deduction. Drawn out of the general reservoir 
on one side are certain features that go back for further testing; 
drawn out of it on the other are certain elements of judgment, 
certain inferences which result in conclusions. Thus we may 
represent the conclusion—Destroy mosquitoes and prevent yel- 
low fever—as the result of a joint process of inductive and 
deductive thinking. 
Iv. RELATION BETWEEN INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION 
Induction and deduction are not to be considered separate and 
distinct forms of thinking; they are mutually dependent upon 
one another. Thus in the last diagram, we must not think of the 
flow of thought as being only in one direction, viz., from the in- 
going pipes to the reservoir, and away from the reservoir along 
the out-going pipes. The flow of thought is in both directions, 
from the out-going to the in-going pipes of the reservoir as well. 
When we are in doubt about the truth in the reservoir, the out- 
going pipes become the in-going pipes and the in-going pipes be- 
come the out-going pipes. There is constant flowing of thought 
back and forth, forth and back, along our line of thinking, so 
that the reservoir of truth is never at a standstill when we are 
thinking. Truth is in the making for us; and we, by questioning 
and testing, become important factors in the making of that truth. 
The content of our minds is not in the form of a solid, but rather 
in the form of a fluid, and thinking sets the fluid in motion.
-P-A-G-E-139
  TWO RELATED KINDS OF THINKING 139 
This ought to make us realize the importance of thinking in 
all our daily life of school and home. If we accept the mate- 
rials before us without question and learn them by heart, our 
reservoir of knowledge is not disturbed except for the addition 
of new portions of truth. Its contents become solidified and 
take the form of blocks rather than remain in the fluid state. 
On the other hand, when we think about what we are studying 
and reading, the content of our study is set in motion and we 
become factors in shaping the ‘course of events. Thus the boys 
who really think about their courses in physics are not satisfied 
with the mere addition of various items to their store of informa- 
tion. One plans a new radio apparatus at home or a modifica- 
tion of the old one. One sets up an electric light in the furnace 
room or changes the connection of his mother’s door bell from 
dry cells to the current carried by the city wires. Girls adjust 
some of the operations of their own garment-making or the 
preparation of food at home, in the light of new prineiples re- 
vealed to them in their domestie science courses. Thus do we 
epunt for something when the contents of our minds are not 
solid but fluid, growing, diminishing, changing, as we read, study, 
think, judge, apply. 
To continue our diagram of mental activity, this movement 
of thinking, considered as a fluid rather than a solid, may be 
sketched as follows:

-P-A-G-E-140
  140 LEARNING TO THINK 
V. HOMELY EXAMPLES OF INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION 
(1) A boy repeatedly trying to throw a curve ball, experiment- 
ing about how to hold and how to deliver it, is performing an 
inductive experiment. His thinking is also inductive. A boy 
pitching in a game, and applying the principles of throwing 
curves is using deduction; he is applying a truth and a skill he 
has learned. Suppose the opponents start to hit his pitching and 
he begins to question why; he asks himself, “What am I doing? 
How can I change?” He is then thinking and experimenting 
inductively. 
(2) A golf player repeatedly taking practice swings to find 
out what is the matter with his “follow through” is thinking and 
practicing inductively. When he is playing the game he applies 
the skill that he has attained, and is practicing deduction. 
(3) Many of the experiments you perform in physics and 
chemistry classes are deductive in the sense that you are merely 
verifying principles that have been established. But the original 
experiments which first established the principles were inductive ; 
they began with an “hypothesis.” It can readily be seen that 
the expertness of the worker largely determines whether his 
work is inductive. Edison, for example, a master of such sub- 
jects as electricity, or Burbank, a master of plant life, may do 
a large share of his thinking as deduction. On the contrary, a 
worker less skilled in the field of electricity or botany would be 
compelled to do much of his thinking by induction. For ex- 
ample, this is the case with a boy building a wireless or radio 
apparatus; or a girl experimenting in her flower garden. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Experiences in Gathering Original Data 
In your laboratory notebook work out one or more of these problems. 
1. Let the boys consult an official baseball “Guide” or “Record 
Book,” or find a September or October sporting sheet of a daily paper 
which contains the batting averages for all National and American 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
TWO RELATED KINDS OF THINKING 141 
league players or the players of your own local league. Classify the 
players by positions; infielders, outfielders, pitchers, and catchers. 
Establish the batting average for each group. That is, find the actual 
data which will prove definitely that pitchers are poor hitters, for 
example, or that outfielders are heavy hitters. Gather the data that 
will tell you exactly how, as hitters, first basemen compare with 
catchers. 
2. The girls may gather twenty-five advertisements from The Ameri- 
can Magazine, The Saturday Evening Post, Harper’s Monthly Maga- 
zine, The Century Magazine, or The Atlantic Monthly. Make a general 
statement concerning the kinds of merchandise advertised in the 
various magazines, the length of the average advertisement, and the 
style of appeal made. Let each student take one old magazine, clip 
out the advertisements, arrange and classify them, to support a con- 
clusion as to the style of appeal or as to the class of merchandise 
likely to be found advertised in the magazine chosen. 
3. Examine the editorials for one week in a daily, or six months 
in a monthly, or one month in a weekly publication; accumulate and 
arrange the specific evidence upon which you can base a general state- 
ment about one or more of the chief editorial interests of the paper. 
For a similar inductive study, consult the files of your school paper 
for the past year. 
4. Secure the help of one of the English teachers. Examine the 
class notebooks of a lower class in your school. Reach conclusions 
(keeping your records of data by individual pupils) about content, 
correctness, neatness, originality, and other standards. Prepare a 
report for your principal. 
Problems for Work in the Classroom 
1. Testing the reasoning of school life. Seeing a difficulty, instantly 
thinking of possible alternative solutions, rejecting the wrong ones and 
seizing upon the right one—these are qualities of good thinking. Make 
use of one of the following projects to illustrate the testing of a guess, 
an hypothesis. 
” (a) A good quarter-back usually tries out cautiously various “safe' 
plays in the opening of a game. If the season is over, ask the quarter- 
back or the team captain to come in to your class to explain the point 
with examples from this year’s games. 
     
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 LEARNING TO THINK 
(b) Reeall a physics or chemistry experiment. Recount the prob- 
lem, and two or three possible solutions which by experiment you were 
compelled to reject. How did you test them? 
(c) Consider the need of a school paper, annual, or some other 
undertaking and several possible ways of financing it. How did 
you or could you reject all but the most practicable plan? 
(d) Form a committee for either a real or an imaginary class picnic, 
party, dance, or entertainment. Let the committee, after preparation 
and practice, dramatize and present to the class a committee meeting in 
which various proposals are made, certain ones rejected, and one 
finally selected. 
(e) Give to a committee the task of preparing proposals for a new 
type of assembly program by your group. Let them carefully plan 
a committee meeting and, after rehearsal, dramatize it before the class. 
Let the work result in a request to the principal, and if he permits, 
in a program actually prepared and presented before the whole 
school. 
(f) How might better order in the halls be secured through student 
officers? Propose three alternative methods of organization, and give 
reasons for rejecting two. 
(g) Consider the value of a school orchestra, a girls’ glee club, 
or some other musical organization. Suggest methods of establish- 
ing it. 
2. Breaking a problem up into its parts. 
(a) Taking an example of a stalled automobile, we may find an 
illustration of the way in which a good thinker proceeds from the gross 
problem “The car won’t go,” to the essential features of the gross 
problem. 
First he looks at his gas tank; then at the feed into the 
earburetor; then to see if it has “spark”; if not, he looks for 
loose connections; if he finds none of these difficulties he ex- 
amines the battery; if the gas and spark are right, he examines 
(b) Recall the questions a physician asks, in diagnosing an illness, 
and compare them with similar skill in another field.
-P-A-G-E-143
  TWO RELATED KINDS OF THINKING 148 
(c) Break up one of these “gross” problems into its special parts: 
(1) Why are my marks not better? 
(2) Why can’t I play better tennis? 
(3) Why can’t I cut ten seconds off my record for the mile? 
(4) Why can’t I do better in oral composition? 
(5) Why am I finding difficulty in this very exercise? 
(6) Why was Hamilton a great statesman? 
(7) Why is Lincoln revered? 
(d) Determine which of the parts into which you have broken the 
gross problem is the “heart,” the “crux,” of the difficulty. Obviously 
skill in including at least all vital parts in the preliminary survey is 
indispensable; equally so, is skill in rejecting the minor parts. 
3. Defining a problem. 
(a) Mr. Parker speaks of people as having three degrees of efficiency 
in locating and defining problems. (1) People who, “sitting tight” 
mentally, do not realize that there is anything wrong. An engine 
knock does not disturb them. (2) People who have only a “vague idea” 
that something ought to be done, like the automobilist who, hearing a 
knock in his engine, begins to tinker at random. (3) People who as 
skilled thinkers begin by locating and clearly marking out the exact 
difficulty. When the starter refuses to turn the engine the skilled 
thinker begins, “Is there spark; is there gas?” ete.t 
Depending of course on the individual and on the nature of the 
problem, all men and women find themselves sooner or later in each 
of the situations named by Mr. Parker. Every automobilist can recall 
incidents that placed him on each of the three levels in driving a car. 
In a similar way Mr. L. was on level (1) “sitting tight,” when in 
college a rival beat him out for “end” in the first two games of the 
season. He was (2) “tinkering at random” when without advice he 
tried to improve his speaking for a certain oratorical contest; and was 
(3) “thinking skillfully” when he located at once the two major weak- 
nesses of a student in English composition and told him how to remedy 
them. <A football coach was (1) “sitting tight” when he failed to 
remove a weak quarterback; was (2) “tinkering at random” when he 
tried many quarters without deciding on any; (3) was “thinking skill- 
fully” when he substituted heavy players on a wet field.

-P-A-G-E-144
  144 LEARNING TO THINK 
(b) Think of meeting problems, in one of which you have “sat 
tight,” in another “tinkered around,” in another “thought skillfully” 
your way out. 
(1) Making something at home 
(2) Earning money for a present 
(3) Alternative lines of procedure in manual training or do- 
mestic science 
(4) Finding substitutes for materials needed 
4. Rejecting and selecting proposals after the difficulty is located 
and defined. If a person in a perplexity cannot locate and define his 
problem clearly, he can only by the merest accident reason himself out. 
Moreover, if he cannot line up the possible alternatives for meeting the 
difficulty, he is likely to remain in trouble. Even worse off is he if, 
when he does realize the problem and does know the alternatives sug- 
gested, he cannot choose between them. Indeed if one is incapable of 
decision, it were perhaps better if he never sensed the need of decision. 
Unfortunately no hard and fast rules for ingenuity and common sense 
can be laid down. Certain general principles “of cutting to the heart 
of a problem” may help. 
(a) Line up, state definitely, and if necessary write out the various 
proposals, so that they may be considered one at a time. Be sure that 
you have all the possible solutions that may have any value. Suppose 
that in settling the Canadian boundary dispute, England and the United 
States had forgotten the alternative “Arbitration.” Suppose, when 
asked to explain a defeat in football, a member of the team either 
intentionally or through ignorance gives several explanations, but 
misses entirely the right one. These are examples of bad thinking. 
(b) Weed out all suggestions that do not have a direct bearing upon 
the heart of the perplexity as you have defined it. Proposals to remedy 
something else, something other than the essential feature, are worth- 
less. Suppose that the question of relieving millions of starving Rus- 
sians were up for consideration. Good thinking might very well refuse 
to tolerate any discussion of the form of government in Russia; it 
might rule out all consideration of Russian aggression in Poland. 
(c) Weed out suggestions that involve more time, strength, money, 
effort, suffering, injustice, than the problem itself causes: for example,
-P-A-G-E-145
  TWO RELATED KINDS OF THINKING 145 
no one would today tolerate the inhuman proposal to blot out a nation 
of enemies after a military victory. 
(d) Weed out proposals which ignore certain undebatable and un- 
mistakable facts of life. For example, it is an unmistakable fact of 
American life that the constitution of the United States provides for 
liberty of religious belief. Proposals to restrict the actions of unusual 
sects or cults may sometimes be justified on other grounds, but no pro- 
posal which neglects “religious liberty” as such can rightly be main- 
tained. 
(e) Weed out all which do not bear directly upon the heart of the 
problem. Weed out next all proposals which would do more harm than 
good. Weed out all that ignore some unmistakable facts or principles 
of life. 
(f) Write out all various proposals you can think of to meet one of 
the following difficulties, or an alternative, as you prefer. 
(1) How shall men and women be induced to cast their ballots? 
(2) How may we prevent interscholastic athletics from being 
earried to excess? 
(3) How can we improve our literary society? 
(4) How can we get better support for our teams? 
(5) How can our students be induced to attend class-meetings? 
5. Mr. Dewey has likened the process of reasoning to the operation 
of a primitive debating society. Imagine a group of warriors so primi- 
tive in intelligence that each has only one idea. At the council fire 
each, in turn, presents his one idea. Then, when the suggestions are 
all in, one after another is rejected, and a choice is finally made. This 
is what a mind does. If the mind is so feeble that it cannot call up 
alternatives, it really cannot exercise judgment. The more fertile a 
mind is in suggestions, the keener must it be in selection. Did you ever 
fail in a erisis? Was it because you could not devise alternatives? 
Because you could not choose between alternatives? Explain when 
and why you failed because of such indecision. ‘ 
6. It has been said of reading that in the first stage of the reading 
process, the reader’s attitude toward the author is receptive; in the 
second stage, it is selective. 
(a) Discuss the point with illustrations from your school work.

(b) What does this statement tell you about how to read to under- 
stand? 
7. The quotation from Lord Bacon which follows is cited in almost 
every book on reading and studying. How does it bear upon the 
principle of selection? Answer in terms of books you know. 
Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few 
to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in 
part; others to be read but not curiously [carefully]; and some few to 
be read wholly and with diligence and attention. Some books, also, 
may be read by deputy. 
8. From your study of thinking, how would you distinguish between 
a “puzzle” and a “problem”? 
9. How does the thinking of a child differ from that of a mature 
person? Give examples of “childish” thinking in your current school 
life. 
10. Cite instances from your school work in which your thinking 
has proceeded from a number of pieces of evidence to the formulation 
of a general principle. Cite instances in which your thinking has applied 
a general rule to some problems of your own. 
11. Professor Robinson has made a criticism of our thinking. Is it 
justified in your own case? 
We do not think enough about thinking, and much of our confusion 
is the result of current illusions in regard to it. Let us see what seems 
to happen in ourselves. The first thing that we notice is that our 
thought moves with such incredible rapidity that it is almost impos- 
sible to arrest any specimen of it long enough to have a look at it. 
When we are offered a penny for our thoughts we always find that we 
have recently had so many things in mind that we can easily make a 
selection which will not compromise us too nakedly. On inspection we 
shall find that even if we are not downright ashamed of a great part of 
our spontaneous thinking, it is far too intimate, personal, ignoble, or 
trivial to permit us to reveal more than a small part of it. I believe 
this must be true of everyone. We do not, of course, know what goes 
on in other people’s heads. They tell us very little and we tell them 
very little. The spigot of speech, rarely fully opened, could never emit 
more than driblets of the ever renewed hogshead of thought. We find it 
hard to believe that other people’s thoughts are as silly as our own, 
but they probably are.t

READING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER 
To read well is to think well; the eye is merely the servant 
of the alert mind. 
SECTION I 
FIVE PRINCIPLES OF READING FOR STUDY 
A good student’s first duty is to give the writer of the book 
studied a fair opportunity to present his thought. To do this, 
he needs to employ five skills which we shall discuss in order. 
(A) Look for the Author’s Statement of His Main Idea 
This may be and often is indicated in the title. Mr. Foster’s 
main idea was “students should study”; Mr. MeMurry’s, “the 
principal factors of study”; Mr. James’s, “the formation of good 
habits”; each main idea was stated in the title. In addition to 
giving a suggestive title, a writer often restates somewhere in 
the introductory paragraphs the central or main idea he proposes 
to develop; and not infrequently he gives in his early pages 
easily recognized hints of the order in which he plans to develop 
his main idea. A skillful reader learns to be on the watch for 
such guides or signposts. To be sure, the reader may not always 
be certain that he has found and has read such hints rightly; 
but, in the early part of an article, he is alertly looking for 
guideposts that will help in the reading journey he is to pursue 
with the writer. 
As said above, the central thought suggested in a title is very 
frequently repeated in one of the opening paragraphs in the 
form of a definite statement, often called the “theme.” After 
several introductory paragraphs, Mr. MeMurry says (page 24) : 
149
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
An analysis, therefore, which reveals the principal factors in 
this study [of the conquering of yellow fever] is likely to bring 
to light the main factors of study in general. 
The reader, recognizing this as MeMurry’s “theme,” knows that 
he will meet several ideas about the factors of study. Foster’s 
first paragraph (page 36) repeats in two different ways the 
question of his title, “Should Students Study?” The effect of 
the repetition is to give the careful reader an anticipation for 
the classified evidence which is to follow. The first sentences in 
almost all the paragraphs of Lockwood (pages 48 ff.) are sign- 
posts of the elements of his thought developed within them. 
After his introductory paragraphs, James speaks (page 96) of 
two maxims of habit formation. The intelligent student knows 
immediately that the discussion which follows will develop at 
least two maxims, which will be the meat of the article for him. 
It is a good practice for a reader, when he has found a state- 
ment of the principal thought that will be developed by the 
writer, to express it to himself in one terse sentence, using his 
own rather than the author’s words. One writer amplifies this 
idea of restating the theme as follows: 
A most common source of error is found in the particular 
wording given [by the student] to the central thought. In order 
to be perfectly definite and accurate any thought should be 
expressed in the form of a full statement. It ordinarily takes 
at least a whole sentence to express a whole thought. But it is 
very common even for students who have formed the habit of 
thinking by points, to allow brief headings, consisting of single 
words or short phrases, to represent entire thoughts. Although 
such headings, on account of their brevity, may be useful, they 
are merely names for the thought, not statements of the thought 
itself ; and it means the loosest kind of thinking to stop with them. 
It is usually easy to tell “what a page is about”; but it usually 
requires keen thinking to word its principal idea sharply in a 
full sentence. Many students are inaccurate in the interpretation 
of authors and in their own meaning, because they lack the 
energy to continue their thinking to this point of wording the 
central idea accurately in a full sentence.

READING FOR STUDY 151 
(B) Keep the Main Idea in Mind While You Are Reading 
After he has found and restated the main idea in his own 
words, a good reader makes a special effort to keep that main 
idea prominently in mind as he reads forward. He stops to 
recall the principal idea, if he is likely to forget it for the 
moment, when reading some interesting details. 
Badly developed articles and addresses which obscure their 
main ideas by a mass of details are easily recognized. Have you 
never heard a speaker tell a long drawn-out story by way of 
developing a point—a tale which is in itself so entertaining that 
the audience loses track of its application? Similarly, a writer 
may obscure from his readers the progress of his main line of 
thought by the use of too many anecdotes or other data. By such 
over-elaboration a skillful reader refuses to be misled; desir- 
ing to know the author’s main thought and its development, he 
puts down as incompetent the man who persists in extensive or 
over-frequent narratives. A well-trained reader always keeps 
in his mind the writer’s major idea, 
(C) Notice How the Various Divisions Are Related to Each Other 
This is the way Mr. Foster’s article looks when his main idea is 
developed by its supporting ideas: 
SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY? 
1. High scholarship in high school means success in college. 
1. Professor Dearborn’s study bears proof of it. 
2. The experience of The University of Chicago gives 
supplementary evidence. 
3. Reed College has similiar data. 
II. High scholarship in college means success in professional 
schools. 
1. Records in Harvard Medical School show it. 
2. Records in Harvard Law School show it. 
3. Records of Yale-graduates in Harvard Law School 
show it.

Perhaps this explanation will give a clearer idea of the pur- 
pose and nature of an outline. The point in mind here is that 
each main division, and each paragraph within the divisions, has 
something to do with the main idea. A division of thought 
almost invariably performs one of these functions: 
(1) It may explain what the main idea is. 
(2) It may present data to establish that main idea. 
(3) It may furnish additional information. 
(4) It may give an illustration. 
(5) It may, in some other way, assist the reader to keep the 
main idea in mind and to understand it more thoroughly. 
There are several striking ways in which the various divi- 
sions of an author’s thought may be related to each other.* 
(1) In a story or novel, one idea may lead to another like 
links in a chain. The sequence may be represented thus: 
a Of course, the chain diagram is but a rough indication of the

sequence of thoughts. Everyone knows that the links in the 
chain of events in Silas Marner, Ivanhoe, or The Necklace, are 
not of equal and uniform size. The various incidents which lead 
up to Macbeth’s decision to commit the murder of Duncan are 
of gradually increasing intensity and significance. A chain 
which could adequately represent any of these sequences would 
consist of links of various sizes and assortments. 
(2) A second relationship of ideas is found in an article like 
Foster’s “Should Students Study?” All his major ideas (I, II, 
III, pages 37, 38, 40), based upon an abundance of data, seem 
to radiate from a central point. This relationship of ideas may 
be represented thus: 
Students should study SS _ 
Again, a careful reader may rightly say that Foster’s three 
divisions are not of equal weight; that the diverging lines of the 
diagram should in some way, by differing in length or width, in- 
dicate varying degrees of significance. This is true; but in gen- 
eral, as in all drawings, diagrams, illustrations, and figures of 
speech, the radiation of lines from the central point approxi- 
mately represents the relation of parts to the whole. 
(8) A third way in which authors relate their ideas to each 
other is represented in this diagram:   
   
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
The ideas grow out of each other very much as the branches of 
a tree reach out from the trunk, The example in this book that 
best indicates this in Lockwood’s article on pages 48 ff. Glance 
through that again to see the trunk line, the five major limbs, and 
the lesser branches. The thinking all reaches back into the 
major topic stated in the title, 
(4) A fourth type of relationship in ideas may be represented 
by a series of concentric circles, or by a coil gradually unwinding 
from a central core. 
These diagrams roughly represent the case of the speaker or 
writer who, in successive parts, repeats his major idea in different 
terms, and perhaps with different illustrations for the sake of 
cumulating emphasis. An example of this relationship of ideas 
is found within the divisions of Mr. Foster’s article. Each of 
the headings marked (1), (2), (3), ete. (page 37), might be 
represented by a circle or coil. It is easy to imagine a sermon 
similarly organized; for example, one in which the minister 
urges, with five concentric divisions of his speech, the theme: 
“Tt is more blessed to give than to receive.” 
The point to grasp is this: An expert student is not content 
until he’sees how the author whose article he is reading organizes 
the various parts of his theme and relates them to each other. 
It is decidedly a mark of weakness in a reader if he grasps 
blindly at an article, trying to recall certain parts quite apart 
from their significance as related to the whole and to all the 
other parts.

  READING FOR STUDY 155 
(D) Vary the Rate of Reading in Accord with Your Purposes 
in Reading 
So far we have considered three stages of the technique of 
reading to understand an author’s thought: (a) Looking for 
his main idea, (b) Keeping this ever in mind, (c) Noting how 
the various parts of the developing thought bear upon the main 
idea. We come now to the fourth. Some skillful readers find 
it helpful to read rapidly through an entire selection in order 
to get a preliminary bird’s-eye view of the reading journey they 
are to take with the writer and to select the high spots in his 
thought for deliberate second reading. On the contrary, other 
eapable readers prefer to proceed deliberately and carefully in 
their first reading, scanning rapidly in their second reading for 
review. 
No one can say which of these two contrasted practices is better 
in study reading. Each reader must decide which habit is 
adapted to his own temperament, and which produces for him 
the most acceptable results. It may be said that most people 
find rapid first reading appropriate when they are studying, and 
deliberate first reading appropriate when they are reading for 
pleasure. Or to put the distinction in another way: If the read- 
ing matter in hand is like most of the articles in this book, 
articles with little pretension to literary style, explanatory in 
their_purpose and content, a bird’s-eye first reading is prefer- 
able. If, on the other hand, the selections are literature, in the 
usual meaning of that term, if the reader is interested not only 
in what the author says and what he means, but also in how he 
says it, a deliberate first reading may be more appropriate. 
Agreeing then, that no hard and fast rule can possibly be laid 
down, we may say that literature of knowledge, which we study 
primarily for information, may wisely be scanned in a first 
reading, and that literature of power, which we read primarily 
for pleasure or for culture, may wisely be read slowly in a first 
perusal. 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
156 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
Since we are considering reading for the purposes of study in 
the first half of this book, and are attempting to analyze habits 
of work which are appropriate for the literature of knowledge 
as contrasted with the literature of power, we may discuss here 
the methods employed in rapid first reading. The procedure 
may be summed up as follows: 
RAPID PRELIMINARY READING 
(1) Read headings and captions. Tf the article has headings 
or captions, the task of preliminary rapid reading consists merely 
in looking them over to get a bird’s-eye view of the whole article 
or chapter.. 
2) Read by paragraphs. Let your eye fall on opening sen- 
tences. Jf one promises that its paragraph is vital, let your 
eyes pass down through the paragraph, reading a sentence, pos- 
sibly in the middle or at the end. 
(3) Give important paragraphs more detailed consideration. 
Usually the opening paragraphs, as we have seen, state the 
general theme, and give suggestions through leading sentences 
of the course of the writer’s thought. The last paragraphs very 
frequently sum up, or restate the points made during the body 
of the article. 
(4) Look for signpost paragraphs. The reader occasionally 
comes upon short, terse paragraphs at the close of divisions of 
thought, or at the beginning of others. Such paragraphs are 
distinctly guides; they either point backward to ground just cov- 
ered or point forward to ground about to be traversed. 
(5) If possible, read by parts that are larger than paragraphs. 
Certainly the reader cannot pause to dwell upon words or 
phrases. He must be able to fill in the thought of a page from 
a few hints here and there, from a few prominent words upon 
which his eyes light. His purpose is not primarily reading; it 
is rather finding out what he needs to read intently as he goes 
through the selection a second time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  READING FOR STUDY 157 
The purpose.of a first rapid preliminary survey is not merely 
to secure a bird’s-eye view of the whole. Equally important 
is the selection of what may be called the high spots. Such 
selection is often made by the skillful reader of a novel. For 
example, someone says that “Chapter Forty-nine shines out 
like a planet amid the sparkling firmament” of Dickens’s novel 
Martin Chuzzlewit, because of the “division among friends,” as 
the famous quarrel between Sarah Gamp and Betsy Prig was 
ealled. Perhaps you have read and reread The Tournament at 
Ashby and the Siege of Torquilstone in Ivanhoe, or have selected 
for rereading the sleep-walking scene in Macbeth or the trial scene 
in The Merchant of Venice. The suggestion will at once come to 
your mind that picking out the high spots in a first reading of 
a novel or play is quite different from the reading we have so 
far considered in this book. That is true; but the principle of 
selection is not very different, and skilled readers do reread the 
most interesting parts of their favorite novels. They read them 
again and again, just as devout people select parts of their Bible 
for frequent perusal. 
In these suggestions about a rapid first reading, we have been 
thinking of parts of approximately one chapter in length. A 
reader is not to stop till he has read through an entire selection, 
if that selection can be looked through in a reasonable time, say 
fifteen or twenty minutes. It is wise to stop the preliminary 
rapid reading at any convenient division of thought after about 
the length of time indicated. Twenty minutes of the rapid sur- 
vey here indicated ought to cover from twenty to fifty pages, 
according to the nature of the material read. Do not make the 
mistake of thinking that such skipping is reading in the truest 
sense. It serves one purpose only—that of getting a preliminary 
bird’s-eye view.   
(E) Reread Deliberately and Thoughtfully 
Careful rereading may apply either to the entire selection or to 
the parts which the preliminary survey has indicated are the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
important. In almost any selection except those in textbooks, 
some parts require but slight attention. This is especially true 
of portions which do not bear directly upon the central idea. 
The central theme itself and its chief supporting ideas are the 
gist of the reading. Look for them; cling to them; and in the 
second rereading, dwell upon them. The sense of relative values 
is always important. 
Two hundred years ago, Isaac Watts advised a preliminary 
survey of the contents and general tenor of a book, to be followed 
by a deliberate and careful second reading of parts of greatest 
value. He expresses the best practice in these words: 
Books of importance on any subject should be first read in a 
more general and cursory manner, to learn a little what they 
promise and what you may expect from the writer’s manner and 
skill. For this end I would advise always that the preface be 
read and a survey taken of the table of contents, before the 
survey of the book. By this means you will not only be better 
fitted to give the book the first reading, but you will be much 
assisted in your second perusal of it, which should be done with 
greater attention and deliberation, and you will learn with more 
ease and readiness what the author pretends to teach. 
In your reading, notice carefully what is new or unknown 
to you before, and review those chapters, pages, or paragraphs. 
Unless a reader has an uncommon and most retentive memory, 
there is searce any book or chapter worth reading once that is 
not worthy of a second perusal. At least take a careful review 
of all the lines or paragraphs which you selected as important 
and make a recollection of the sections which you thought truly 
valuable. 
There is another reason also why I choose to take a cursory 
survey of a book before I sit down to read it and to dwell upon 
it with studious attention ; that is, that there may be several diffi- 
culties in it which we cannot easily understand and conquer at 
the first reading, for want of a fuller comprehension of the 
author’s whole scheme. Therefore, in such books, we should not 
delay in the first perusal till we master every difficulty, for per- 
haps many of these difficulties would appear to be solved when 
we have proceeded further in that book, or would vanish of 
themselves upon a second reading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  READING FOR STUDY 159 
If, after you have finished rereading, you can lay aside your 
book, close your eyes, see a fairly clear path of thought with its 
parts, by which the writer has made good his central idea or has 
tried to make it good; if you can in a brief summary restate that 
course of thought orally to yourself or to others, you have per- 
formed one duty of a careful student. You have been intelli- 
gently receptive. You have laid hold upon the writer’s thought. 
There are, then, five steps of reading to understand: 
(1) Look first for the author’s statement of his main idea. 
(2) Keep this main idea in mind as you read. 
(3) Notice how various parts of a selection bear upon the 
writer’s main ideas 
(4) Vary the rate of reading in accord with your reading 
purpose and with the nature of the materials. A rapid 
first reading is often helpful. 
(5) Reread deliberately, paying special attention to essential 
parts.

Reading Projects 
1. Wm. J. Gaynor, at the time mayor of New York, wrote for The 
Independent an article called “Books and Reading,” Vol. 73, page 1191. 
Use this as a study passage. He shows that “reading is to no purpose 
without thinking.” He gives information about the reading habits of 
many distinguished people, and tells of his own practices as a reader. 
Give an oral report of Gaynor’s article. 
2. “The Reading Habits of Distinguished People.” The Independent, 
Vol. 93, page 252, has an article which explains the reading habits 
of Miss Ida M. Tarbell, of Hon. G. H. Hodges, former governor of 
Kansas, of President E. B. Bryan of Ohio University, and of others. 
Report the chief reading habits of each of these persons. 
3. Find an account of Benjamin Franklin’s reading. Examine his 
Autobiography or the second volume of Sparks’s Life of Benjamin 
Franklin, or any other life of Franklin to which you may have access 
in your libraries. See how quickly you can locate the passage that tells 
about Franklin’s reading and reading habits. Report. 
4. Read the article “On Skipping” by Thomas L. Masson, in Zhe 
Bookman, Vol. 51, page 426. Report to the class the substance of 
this satire of one who pretends he has read, but has not.

  SECTION II 
REASONABLE RAPIDITY AND REASONABLE 
THOROUGHNESS IN READING 
“You were too long at that task.” 
“You did not perform that task thoroughly.” 
These two comments made either alone or together, about 
any duty that we have to perform, are perhaps the severest 
criticisms that we can receive. It matters not what the activ- 
ity we are expected to carry out. After a boy has mowed a 
lawn, or a girl has swept a room, a parent, upon inspecting the 
work, applies to the job two main standards of good work- 
manship: how long did it take; how thoroughly was it done? 
If the worker dawdles, consuming two hours when one hour 
would have been ample, the criticism is “too slow.” On the 
other hand, if the worker leaves grass uncut about the edges 
of the lawn and the sidewalks, or wisps of broom scattered 
about, dust on the furniture, and rugs rumpled on the floor, 
the criticism is “not thorough.” Reasonable economy of time 
and reasonable thoroughness of accomplishment, as two tests 
of good work, may be applied to almost every duty of life. 
The two tests are applicable to the silent reading which con- 
stitutes one part of the processes of study. Assume that a class 
is asked to read in one study period a passage of about fifty 
pages of fairly easy historical material. If the class is com- 
posed of average students, at the close of the hour some will 
have read ten pages, some twenty, some forty. Others will 
have read the entire assignment twice, once rapidly in a pre- 
view, and a second time more slowly, dwelling upon the essential 
parts. And this wide difference of reading accomplishment is 
present, assuming that all the students diligently did their 
161
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
best throughout the entire study period. The fact is that a 
group of thirty students show widely varying attainments in 
economy of time in reading. They have different reading habits. 
Extremely rapid readers cover five times more ground than the 
extremely slow. This is not idle statement; it is a fact which 
is doubtless true in your own group, during the period in which 
you are now reading. Some of you are wasteful of time in 
silent reading. 
Moreover, the class will vary within somewhat narrower 
limits as to the reasonable thoroughness with which they com- 
prehend the meaning of the fifty pages of history. At the close 
of the period some will be able to state accurately the central 
idea of the passage, will be able to repeat the major divisions 
of the theme, and will have considered the meaning and applica- 
tion of the facts presented. Others will possess only a vague 
idea of what the passage is about. Investigations have shown 
that in the ordinary group of students some will comprehend 
what they read at least three times as well as others. It is 
altogether probable that some of the members of your own 
class, while reading the articles of this book, vary in their 
thoroughness of comprehension in at least the ratio 3:1. 
There is a very unmistakable relation between reasonable 
economy and reasonable thoroughness in reading. Under ordi- 
nary conditions, the reader who covers his assignments with 
moderate speed is more likely to comprehend well what he reads 
than is the skimmer who merely glances over the pages or the 
plodder who toils through the selection word by word, sentence 
by sentence. Reasonable economy of time is almost always 
accompanied by reasonable thoroughness in comprehension. 
The reason for this fact is not far to seek. All through 
the discussions in this book we have been thinking of reading 
as the process of grasping ideas found upon the printed page. 
These ideas are not words, sentences, and paragraphs; the 
printed page is composed of mere symbols which embody the 
ideas. Moreover, the ideas themselves are not a lot of separate 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  REASONABLE RAPIDITY AND THOROUGHNESS 163 
and isolated units, like so many pebbles on the seashore; they 
are rather like a string of stones set in a necklace; they are 
bound together by a thread of thought. The relationships be- 
tween ideas, their order and sequence, their individual con- 
tributions to the main stream of thought, are almost as im- 
portant to the reader as are the individual ideas themselves. 
Upon this basis rests the explanation of why reasonable rapid- 
ity in reading and reasonable thoroughness go hand in hand. 
The plodder or the dawdler advances too slowly to see relation- 
ships; the habitual skimmer proceeds too rapidly to see relation- 
ships. To use a homely figure: The plodder “cannot see the 
forest for the trees”; while the habitual skimmer sees only the 
dim outlines of the forest. The symbols occupy the plodder’s 
time. Each single idea requires too much energy. He loses per- 
spective. The skimmer retains nothing but perspective. But, 
on the other hand, the reader who has developed habits of 
economy in his rate of reading is far more likely to grasp the 
relationships of ideas. 
No discussion of reasonable economy of time in the perform- 
ance of any duty, including reading duties, can omit another 
fact of time adjustment. That is, life does not always give a 
student a preparation period of exactly forty-five or exactly 
sixty minutes for a history lesson. Amid the pressure of other 
duties an editor may occasionally find it imperative to write an 
article in fifteen minutes; a minister may find that one fore- 
noon, not three as ordinarily, must suffice for the preparation 
of his Sunday morning sermon. Sometimes a lawyer must con- 
dense his preparation for even an important case into limits 
of time far narrower than his ordinary procedure allows. All 
workers are called upon occasionally to turn out a product under 
conditions of high pressure by intensifying their preparation. 
And it must be borne in mind that the value of the product 
which is thus prepared under stress of limited time is not judged 
with more than ordinary leniency. Teachers, Sunday congrega- 
tions, juries or judges, are not accustomed to ask a speaker:
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
“How much time did you have at your disposal?” They ask: 
“What about the product; is it good, indifferent, or poor?” 
This principle from real life cannot be denied. Its applica- 
tion to the performance of school tasks ought to lead the student 
to frequent exercise of short periods of extremely high tension, 
in which his mind as an intent worker is firmly set on a good 
product in spite of limited time for preparation. 
Possibly you have been irritated by the constant repetition 
throughout the preceding paragraphs of the word reasonable. 
Let us see if that frequent repetition can be justified. Every 
boy who has mowed lawns and every girl who has swept rooms 
will agree that no two lawns are equally hard to cut and that 
no two rooms are equally hard to sweep. A problem in mathe- 
matics or an experiment in science is not just a problem or an 
experiment. To use a homelier example, the cleaning of a Ford 
ear after a dusty trip is not the same job as the cleaning of 
a Packard after a trip in the mud, although both are tasks of 
cleaning cars. 
The same truth applies to various reading and study tasks. 
One assignment of fifty pages, an extremely interesting narra- 
tive of the siege of Yorktown, or an account of the duel be- 
tween Hamilton and Burr, is an easy task compared with fifty 
pages which analyze in detail the economic condition of the 
colonies in 1798 or the destitution of a country swept by the 
ravages of war. The reading of an easy poem like “The Ride of 
Paul Revere” is not an identical task with the reading of a 
hard poem like “My Last Duchess.” Every reading task has an 
individuality of its own. It resembles other similar tasks in 
a general way, but it has its own degree of difficulty, its own 
perplexities. Therefore, what is economy of workmanship in 
one reading problem might be extreme wastefulness in another, 
even if the two duties are both reading tasks. That is why 
we must use the adjective reasonable in speaking both of econ- 
omy and of thoroughness. 
Obviously, if we have to limit both rate and thoroughness 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
     REASONABLE RAPIDITY AND THOROUGHNESS 165 
by such a qualifying adjective as “reasonable,” it is almost im- 
possible to estimate with mathematical precision the speed with 
which an efficient reader advances. We may, however, ven- 
ture a calculation, imagining that the worker is reading simple 
and fairly easy prose, like the present discussion. In general, 
one’s rate of silent reading ought to be about three times as 
rapid as his rate of oral reading. A very deliberate oral reader 
or speaker utters about one hundred words a minute; ordinary 
speakers utter approximately one hundred twenty-five per min- 
ute; rapid speakers, one hundred fifty; and those who are ex- 
tremely rapid rise to about two hundred words in sixty seconds. 
But a silent reader ought to read fairly easy material at the 
rate of at least three hundred words a minute; his skill is prob- 
ably not high unless he reaches four hundred words in sixty 
seconds. 
Unless you have had your attention directed to economy of 
rate, and have deliberately speeded up your rate according to 
the suggestions on page 156, it is probable that you are one 
hundred words a minute too slow in ordinary silent reading. 
You recall that greater speed does not necessarily mean a fall- 
ing off in thoroughness of comprehension; it means the very 
opposite. The concentration necessary for increased speed, 
enabling the mind better to see relationships of ideas, really 
results in additional thoroughness of comprehension. 
When trying to speed up your silent reading until it approxi- 
mates reasonable economy of time, bear in mind that there are 
materials which need to be read very deliberately. This is 
particularly true of a great piece of literature. While he is 
reading a poem, a reader needs to sense it, to feel it, to appre- 
ciate the style, to see all the delicate shades both of thought 
and of expression. Moreover, as we shall see in later chapters, 
great literature always leaves a very large share of the work 
to the reader himself. “The quality of mercy” speech in The 
Merchant of Venice challenges the reader to let his mind dwell 
upon its meaning, to supply out of his own life an abundance  
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
of experiences which support the truth upon Portia’s lips. In 
fact, the maker of literature is dependent upon such contribut- 
ing powers on the part of his readers. Reasonable rapidity in 
reading a great poem may be very slow speed indeed, as com- 
pared with the perusal of a reference book to locate a definite 
piece of information, or the reading of an easy story, the out- 
lines of which ought to pass through the reader’s mind in easily 
moving succession. 
The reading of a textbook should normally be slow. Materials 
in textbooks are highly condensed; they cover a large field in 
limited space. They often present a multitude of facts and 
figures. In short, a textbook calls for the economy of time which 
points toward deliberateness rather than haste, for somewhat the 
same reason that great poetry should be read slowly. Each calls 
upon the reader to do a large amount of supplementing, think- 
ing, weighing, applying. Do not forget, however, that the real 
study of a passage in a textbook is normally a second reading. 
It is often preceded by a first bird’s-eye view of the whole, a 
preliminary survey to get the lay-out of the reading journey 
that is to be taken later by leisurely stages. Rapid first reading ; 
deliberate and thoughtful second reading of actual study mate- 
rial is in order. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
A Class Project: Determine the Rate of Silent Reading 
Select any fairly easy essay in one of your literature books, or choose 
Mr. Kitson’s article beginning on page 115 of this book. At a given 
signal begin reading silently and read at your normal rate for exactly 
five minutes. Mark the place at which you stop. Estimate the number 
of words on a page by averaging three passages of ten lines each. Then 
arrange the names of: the class in a column on the board, in the order 
of the number of words each reports. The number halfway down the 
column indicates the class “median” rate, for there are just as many in
-P-A-G-E-167
       REASONABLE RAPIDITY AND THOROUGHNESS 167 
your group who read more rapidly as there are who read more slowly 
than the one indicated by the median number. This median for fairly 
easy material should be in the neighborhood of 300 words a minute 
for a high-school senior class. 
You will discover a fairly wide range of rate between the swiftest 
and the slowest readers; perhaps that difference may reach the ratio 
2:1 or even 3:1. Probably the readers at the two extremes are reading 
too rapidly and too slowly, respectively. 
Follow this with a discussion of rate in silent reading (see page 
165): What causes slow reading? What is the effect of very rapid 
reading? Why does it seriously interfere with economy in school work 
to read with one’s lips? Other questions may arise. 
Individual Projects 
1. Theodore Roosevelt must have been a very rapid reader. An arti- 
cle in which he describes his reading habits is to be found in The 
Literary Digest, Vol. 50, page 896. Look up the article and report 
in detail what Mr. Roosevelt means by the suggestive phrase “reading 
through a subject.” He says in part: 
If I get interested in any subject I read different books connected 
with it, and probably also read books on subjects suggested by it... . 
Now I read Burroughs too often to have him suggest anything save 
himself; but I am exceedingly glad that Charles Sheldon has arisen to 
show what a hunter-naturalist . . . can do for our last great wilder- 
ness, Alaska. From Sheldon I turned to Stewart Edward White and 
then began to wander afar, with Herbert Ward’s Voice from the Congo 
and Mary Kingsley’s writings . . . and Grahame’s Sketches of South 
Africa. 
2. The Syracuse, New York, Public Library has published a little 
pamphlet entitled Roosevelt, Lover of Books. You may be able to 
obtain a copy at your Public Library; certainly you can purchase one 
for fifteen cents, from the Syracuse Library. In compact form is pre- 
sented a survey of Mr. Roosevelt’s books and reading tastes. Collected 
also are his comments like the following: 
Mark Twain, who was not only a great humorist but a great philoso- 
pher, said that there are 869 different kinds of lies, but that the only

  SECTION III 
READING TO REMEMBER 
In searching for and finding the central theme of a writer, in 
watching for and detecting the forward movement of his thought 
as one division follows another, the student has performed his 
first study as a reader. He has still another to perform in 
order to complete the receptive process in reading. He must fix 
the author’s thought in his own mind so that he can remember 
it, and on occasion repeat or summarize it. To perceive the mes- 
sage, to fix it in mind, and to be able to reproduce it are the 
receptive duties of a student. To be borne in mind here is a 
distinetion between the sheer act of learning something by heart, 
and remembering ideas. 
Certain habits of working assist in the second receptive 
activity just referred to: 
(A) Have a strong determination to remember. Read with 
a strong determination to ascertain and remember the essential 
parts. Give your undivided attention to the content, resolved 
that you will retain the major ideas. Strange, what you can 
do if you really make up your mind to do it! Of course, you 
need to choose carefully what you want to remember. Once 
selected, these parts can be recalled at will, if you set your mind 
to the task. Think of the time when you will need the informa- 
tion or the ideas. 
(B) Analyze the meaning of what you wish to remember. Be 
sure that you understand very clearly the meaning of the parts 
you are to remember. You cannot permanently retain some- 
thing the meaning of which you but vaguely understand, al- 
though for the time being, after much diligent application you 
169 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
ean repeat the words in which the author originally stated an 
idea. Doubtless each of us, by main strength, remembers certain 
number combinations, like 6 x 9=54; 7x 9=63; 8x 7=56. 
We may not realize it, but we never usefully remember these 
combinations, or any similar combinations, until we have thor- 
oughly understood them. We all know how to recall the thirty- 
one-day months: “Thirty days hath September,” ete.—a mere 
little pleasing jingle of a formula; few recall definitely learning 
it. Yet how often we use it. Fortunate, indeed, we should be, 
if similar jingles could help us remember what we study in 
school. As a matter of fact, such devices are very meager in 
number, and very generally useless. 
Far better than the attempt to associate what you wish to 
remember with a device of this sort, generally of little more 
value than a string around your thumb, or a ring placed on the 
wrong finger, is the careful attempt to understand the new idea 
by comparing it or contrasting with ideas already in mind. If 
by comparison and contrast, you tie up a new theorem of the 
triangle with the theorem which you learned yesterday, you more 
easily remember both. The secret of good memories is that they 
form very many different associations around every fact they 
wish to remember. Active minds, minds that think most about 
their experiences, that weave those experiences into systematic 
relations with each other, are the minds with the best memory. 
It is quite obvious why some boys never forget an idea that 
concerns stamp collecting, or wireless, or an automobile engine, 
while they easily forget Latin declensions or facts of history. 
They think and talk much about the former subjects. 
(C) Remembering ideas as they are related to each other. We 
have seen that a well-written article has a development of 
thought in orderly sequence. The various parts are joined to 
each other; each follows the one which precedes for a reason; 
and each part has a relationship to the section which immedi- 
ately follows it. Seeing this sequence of ideas as the author 
presents them, the whole theme made up of parts definitely
-P-A-G-E-171
  READING TO REMEMBER 171 
bound up with each other—seeing relationships, as Dearborn 
explains it on page 110—is an essential condition of remember- 
ing the thought. Knowledge is not made up of a lot of separate 
particles like lumps of coal in a bin. Isolated and unrelated facts 
are almost valueless and extremely hard to remember. But when 
facts are associated in the mind, when they are welded together 
in some relationship, meaning, or significance, they can be 
retained in memory. Perhaps you have heard a football enthu- 
siast, years after a famous game, relate the important details of 
that contest. His memory is accurate because the details were 
all welded together in a total meaning which permanently holds 
together the details themselves. 
To remember ideas as they are related to each other in a book 
you are studying, form the habit of restating the author’s divi- 
sions of thought in your own words, often actually saying aloud 
your summarizing sentences. For example, at this point in this 
present discussion you might summarize as follows: 
READING TO REMEMBER 
Meaning: After grasping an author’s thought, a good reader 
remembers it in order to reproduce it. 
(a) He reads with a strong determination to recall. 
(6) He tries hard to see the meaning of each part, the “heart” 
of each division of thought. 
(c) He endeavors to see how the parts of thought fit together, 
what relationship they bear to each other. 
(D) Fiz key-words in mind. The fourth principle of remem- 
bering thought is this: Endeavor to find in the article itself, 
certain catchwords, or key-words, which will serve as large 
pegs upon which to hang the threads of thought. For example, 
James Bryce wrote an exposition about the causes of migrations 
of men. His three key-words were Food, War, Religion; under 
each he grouped several kinds of migration. “Citizenship Du- 
ties” might be treated under the key-words Community, State, 
National, International. Look for these key-words. If the text
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
does not have them, supply them if possible from your own 
vocabulary, for the various divisions of the thought. Distin- 
guish sharply between remembering key-words, and remember- 
ing the entire thought as expressed in the exact words of an 
author. 
The key-words for “The Nature of Study,” pages 21-31, are 
named below. See if you ean remember and reproduce the 
various factors without referring to the article. 
(1) Purposing (5) Memorizing 
(2) Supplementing (6) Utilizing 
(3) Organizing (7) Questioning 
(4) Evaluating 
Have you ever had the experience of being alone in a large 
erowd, and then suddenly coming upon a friend? The warm 
feeling of pleasure that passes through you is said to be the 
“slow of recognition.” During such a moment your mind is 
said to be especially ready to receive permanent impressions. 
Similarly, in recalling the parts of an article just read, if 
you can possibly have the glow of satisfied recognition in con- 
nection with the key-words, the probabilities are that you will 
retain the impression. This is really one reason why you can 
remember easily lessons in courses which you like heartily, 
while you remember with greater difficulty lessons in courses to 
which you are less devoted. When you enjoy a study, you have 
more opportunities for the glow of recognition so essential to 
permanent retention. 
(E) Repeat aloud what you wish to remember. Many clergy- 
men have testified that they usually fix their sermons in mind 
with their thoughts figuratively upon their prospective hearers. 
They say their outline aloud, or even repeat their entire sermons 
with the congregations in imagination before them. Say over 
to yourself what you wish to remember; say it for an object;   
-P-A-G-E-173
  READING TO REMEMBER 173 
translate the thought into your own words, and it is likely to 
become established in your mind. Verbal reproduction is a 
highly important aid to memory. 
(F) Always make a final review. You have all learned by 
experience one other practice which contributes to your skill 
in remembering a lesson: a vivid final review. Think a lesson 
through at night just before going to bed; then it will be clear 
and complete in the morning. This is especially true in your 
review if you imagine yourself responding to topics suggested 
by your teacher. 
(G) Plan a way to use the ideas in a problem of your own. In 
all your work apply the knowledge, data, information, thinking, 
just as soon as possible to some problem of your own. Do some- 
thing with it, tell it to a classmate, appropriate it for a con- 
versation with a friend or an acquaintance. The best way to 
fix in mind a short story or anecdote is to use it. This is why 
our textbooks are nowadays arranged with problems at the end 
of each section. Mr. Whipple explains this principle: 
In all your work apply your knowledge as much as possible 
and as soon as possible. There is scarcely any rule more fun- 
damental than this one. To be sure to remember a thing, do 
something with it, try it, use it, put it into function, tell it to 
someone, go to almost any length to express what has been im- 
pressed upon you. All teachers know that they reach most com- 
plete appreciation and permanent retention of any topic when 
they have had occasion to teach it to others. The astounding 
grasp displayed by men in the learned professions over the 
thousands of intricate details of their callings is a consequence 
of the constant use they are making of these materials. Even 
so trivial an issue as the remembering of some good story is 
best met by telling the story to someone as soon as possible after 
hearing it or reading it. An excellent plan for any student 
who is anxious to master any topic is to seek to explain it to 
another person."

REMEMBERING WHAT ONE READS? 
Cuartes F, RicHarDsON 
Reading Suggestions 
(1) Which of the seven principles of reading to remember, page 
174, are named by Mr. Richardson in the following article? As you 
come upon them, write down the points which he treats. 
(2) Carefully notice the parts of Richardson’s article which deal with 
sheer memorizing, repetition, and verbatim learning, and the parts which 
deal with the more general remembering and reproducing of thought. 
(3) Pay especial attention to the “selective memory” as outlined in 
this article. You can fix the principle in mind by recalling a case of 
deliberate rejection on your own part of some portion of an article read. 
Possibly you ean find in this very article a portion you will deliberately 
reject. 
Scarcely anything is more annoying to readers than the fact 
that they forget so much of what they read. In history, dates 
and names pass from the mind; poems once known by heart 
fade away from recollection; and the characters, the plots, or 
perhaps the very titles of stories which were once familiar 
depart as utterly as though they had never been known ai all. 
In connection with this question of the retention or non-reten- 
tion of what one reads, it should never be forgotten that the 
powers of the human mind are arranged in such a way that we 
must forget a great deal, however carefully we strive to remem- 
ber all we can. A large part of our knowledge, too, is to be 
considered as an intellectual exercise; and we should no more

lament its loss than the fact that we do not remember what we 
had for breakfast a year ago today, or the exact length of the 
invigorating walk we took on that breezy morning week before 
last. Some books are by no means read without profit if a part, 
or even the whole, of them be forgotten beyond recall. And | 
it is a consolation to reflect that the very best use to which some 
of our past reading may be put is to be forgotten as speedily 
as possible. If we have lost some things that were good and 
pleasant, we have luckily blotted from our minds not a little 
that was noxious and unattractive. 
But after all reservations have been made, we should not 
forget the duty of remembering all we really ought to remem- 
ber, so far as the natural powers of our minds permit. (|The 
first and the last aid to.a memory is a habit of paying strict 
attention to what we io 
     
     
   
      
   
                   
   
    Special efforts should be made to retain what is gathered 
from reading (says President Porter’) if any such efforts are 
required. Some persons read with an interest so wakeful and 
responsive, and an attention so fixed and energetic, as to need 
no appliances and no efforts in order to retain what they read. 
They look upon a page and it is imprinted upon the memory. 
But there are others who read only to lose and to forget. Facts 
and truths, words and thoughts, are alike evanescent. We shall 
not attempt to explain here the nature of these differences. We 
are concerned only to devise the remedy; we insist that those 
who labor under these difficulties should use special appliances 
to avoid or overcome them. But that upon which we insist 
most of all is that what we read we should seek to make our 
own only in the manner and after the measure of which we are 
eapable. 
Dr. Porter then goes on to advise each reader to follow his 
natural bent and aptitudes; and not to worry, if he lacks a good 
verbal memory, over his inability to remember choice phrases or 
striking stanzas, nor to vex his soul over his failure to retain 
names and dates.

  REMEMBERING WHAT ONE READS TTT 
‘When a man reads (he says) he should put himself into the 
most intimate intercourse with his author, so that all his energies 
of apprehension, judgment, and feeling may be occupied with, 
and aroused by, what his author furnishes, whatever it may be. 
If repetition or review will aid him in this, as it often will, let 
him not disdain or neglect frequent reviews. If the use of the 
pen, in brief or full notes, in catechwords or other symbols, will 
aid him, let him not shrink from the drudgery of the pen and 
the commonplace book. But there is no charm or efficacy in 
such mechanism by itself. It is only valuable as a means to an 
end, and that end is to quicken the intellectual energies by 
arousing and holding the attention. 
Hamerton has expressed an opinion that what is called a ‘“‘de- 
fective harmony” is by no means an unmixed evil. He says there 
is such a thing as a “selecting memory, which is not only useful 
for what it retains, but also for what it rejects.” What really 
interests us we can usually retain without recourse to any 
elaborate system of mnemonics. That which does not properly 
interest us we cannot thus retain. 
Had Goethe been a poor student, bound down to the exclusive 
legal studies which did not greatly interest him, it is likely that 
no one would ever have suspected his immense faculty of assimi- 
lation. In this way men who are set by others to load their 
memories with what is not their proper intellectual food never 
get the credit of having any memory at all, and finally come 
to believe themselves that they have none. These bad memories 
are often the selecting memories. They seldom win distinction 
in examinations; but in literature and art they are quite incom- 
parably superior to the miscellaneous memories that receive only 
as boxes and drawers receive what is put into them. A good 
literary or artistie memory is not like a post office, that’ takes 
in everything, but like a very well-edited periodical, which 
prints nothing that does not harmonize with its intellectual life. 
I fully believe in training and disciplining and developing the 
memory. But I also believe that the very essence of that train- 
ing is the cultivation of a habit of friendliness, kinship, and 
  
1Mmemonics: rules for improving the memory. 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
178 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
intimacy with the printed page. Mere mnemonic devices have 
been said to be like tying a frying-pan to one coat-tail and a 
child’s kite to another. The true art of memory is the art of 
perceiving the relations and uses of things, not their external 
characteristics; and above all, not their artificial relations to 
some essentially foreign object or symbol. The purpose of mem- 
ory is to help us; when a memory-machine fails to help us, and 
cumbers and overshadows that which it pretends to aid, it is 
worse than worthless. 
Again, it should be kept in mind that no one brain has a right 
to tyrannize over another, or to lay down laws for it, in this 
matter of memory. For instance, a certain person remembers 
instinctively, and without effort, the name of the author, pub- 
lisher, and printer of whatever book he takes in his hand, and 
also its size, shape, color of binding, and style of typography. 
Two or three readings of a college catalogue leave upon his mind 
the surnames, Christian names, and residences of a majority of 
the persons there recorded. Guidebooks and city directories are 
a rest and recreation to him; the names, locations, and pastors 
of the majority of all the churches in the cities he has visited are 
retained in mind without effort, and frequently, when visiting 
a town for the first time, this habit of memory leads him to be 
considered a local antiquary and specialist. Now, these memories 
seem so natural to him, and are acquired so absolutely without 
effort of any kind, that he can hardly understand why everyone 
else does not remember them equally well. But he has not the 
slightest right to prescribe a course of guidebooks, college cata- 
logues, or city directories for others, any more than they have 
to demand that he recite Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner,” or give 
the dates of the Third Punic War, or the signing of the Magna 
Charta, or Braddock’s defeat, which he remembers with as much 
difficulty as any other reader. 
In other words, no one has a right to insist that anotker per- 
son shall remember as or what he himself remembers. But it 
should always be demanded of every reader that he conscien-
-P-A-G-E-179
REMEMBERING WHAT ONE READS 179 
tiously try to strengthen his memory by seeking to understand 
the nature and purpose of what he reads, its serviceableness to 
himself, and to the world through him. 
This diversity of memories is admirably stated by Cardinal 
Newman. 
We can (he says) form an abstract idea of memory, and call 
it one faculty which has for its subject-matter all past facts of 
our personal experience; but this is really only an illusion; for 
there is no such gift of universal memory. Of course, we all 
remember in a way as we reason, in all subject-matters, but I 
am speaking of remembering rightly, as I spoke of reasoning 
rightly. yIn real fact, memory, as a talent, is not one indivisible 
faculty, but a power of retaining and recalling the past in this 
or that department of our experience, not in any whatever. 
Two memories, which are both specially retentive, may also be 
very different. Some men can recite the canto of a poem, or a 
good part of a speech, after once reading it, but have no head 
for dates. Others have great capacity for the vocabulary of 
languages, but recollect nothing of the small occurrences of the 
day or year. Others never forget any statement which they 
have read, and can give volume and page, but have no memory 
for faces. I have known those who could, without effort, run 
through the succession of days on which Easter fell for years 
back; or could say where they were, or what they were doing, 
on a given day in a given year; or could recollect the Christian 
names of friends and strangers; or could enumerate in exact 
order the names on all the shops from Hyde Park corner to the 
Bank; or had so mastered the University Calendar as to be 
able to bear an examination in the academical history of any 
M.A. taken at random. And I believe in most of these cases 
the talent, in its exceptional character, did not extend beyond 
several classes of subjects. There are a hundred memories as 
there are a hundred virtues. 
Phenomenal memory—the power to repeat a chapter after a 
single reading or a sermon after one hearing—is often associated 
with mental incapacity in other lines of effort. The ability to 
“quote poetry,” or, in the exaggerated phrase, “to repeat all 
Shakespeare by heart,” is of course a comfort in sleepless nights, 
or in travel, or in age. But, after all, there is no use in trying 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
180 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
to make one’s head a reference-library for things that might as 
well be left between the covers of books. The selective memory, 
that adapts needed things to its own uses, is the best. Says the 
historian Rhodes of two self-educated Presidents, Andrew John- 
son and Abraham Lincoln: “Johnson never mastered a book as 
Lincoln did the Bible and Shakespeare, weaving the substance 
into his mental being.” 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Exercises to Be Worked Out in Class Discussion 
1. You may have amusing class exercises by naming trivial memory 
devices like tying a string around one’s finger. See how many are in 
the experience of the class. Richardson calls these “frying-pan and 
coat-tail mnemonic devices,” page 178. 
2. What “freaks” of memory, special kinds of memory, are known to 
your group? Can you match the case of a physician’s wife who never 
forgets a telephone number? 
3. How shall we apply the principle of selection, suggested by Rich- 
ardson above, in determining what to remember of an author’s thought? 
What will you remember from Richardson’s article? 
4. A good literary or artistic memory is not like a post office, that 
takes in everything, but like a very well-edited periodical, which prints 
nothing that does not harmonize with its intellectual life. 
Is this statement true of other than “literary” and “artistic” 
memories? 
5. What are the chief objections against cramming for an examina- 
tion in the light of the cardinal principles of remembering and repro- 
ducing? How may a final review help establish relationships? 
6. “Faint, glimmering, confused ideas will vanish like images in the 
twilight.” Cite examples of ideas vividly grasped which persist in your 
memory, as contrasted with glimmering ideas which you once had in a 
dim way and have now forgotten. One example is the difficulty of 
recalling what someone has written about the style of a certain author, 
if you have yourself really understood the quality named. 
7. Stop and recall what you have read during the process of study- 
ing. Close your book and strive to restate the main thought as the

writer has developed it; state the ideas again in terms of your own. 
Do not try to recall exact words. Carry through a class laboratory 
exercise using a part of one of the selections in the next chapter of 
this book. 
8. It has been experimentally proved that the first repetition of any- 
thing to be memorized is by far the most important, especially if it is 
done very thoughtfully and analytically, with a definite intent to remem- 
ber. You might try the experiment of reading a stanza of a few lines 
just once, with a strong determination to recall. Practice with these 
lines from Shakespeare: 
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold, 
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; 
It yearns me not if men my garments wear; 
Such outward things dwell not in my desires; 
But if it be a sin to covet honor, 
I am the most offending soul alive. 
Henry the Fifth, Act IV, Se. iii. 
9. Recall books to which you can apply the principle of selective 
memory, using Bacon’s famous sentence, “Some books are to be tasted, 
others swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.” 
10. The wonder is not that we remember but that we should ever for- 
get. Why? 
11. An eminent French educator laid down as one of his principles: 
“What enters the mind alone, dies in the mind alone.” What did he 
wish the reader to understand by this principle?

  SECTION V 
HOW TO HELP YOUR MEMORY’ 
Emer B. Bryan 
Reading Suggestions 
1. President E. B. Bryan of Ohio University explains that the 
ability to remember depends not primarily upon native or inborn 
power, but rather upon habits of work. While one cannot improve his 
memory, he can improve the use of his memory. 
2. With this in mind, and desiring as you do to have the power of 
remembering what you study, look earnestly to see how Mr. Bryan 
makes the point: “Good holding depends upon good getting.” 
3. Be able to give an explanation with a concrete illustration from 
some of your own work, of “good getting” in one of your courses. 
To get at anything like an accurate conception of memory, 
two facts at least need to be noted: (1) People differ very 
greatly in their ability to recall isolated, disconnected events or 
things. Some people with apparently little or no effort recall 
dates, places, names, and all kinds of disconnected matters. 
This is what Morgan calls Desultory Memory. Those who can 
remember in this way have always been able to do it; they have 
not acquired it. They do not know how they do it. There is no 
“how.” If there were, it would no longer be Desultory, but 
would become Systematic Memory. The “how” makes it Syste- 
matic. It follows that Desultory Memory cannot, as such, be 
cultivated, for cultivation introduces a method, which consti- 
tutes it at once as Systematic and not Desultory. (2) Memory 
is a@ resultant. Memory is not positive in the sense that it is a

  HOW TO HELP YOUR MEMORY 183 
faculty or an activity with which we do something. Memory 
is, to put it flatly, what happens because something else has 
happened. It is the answer, the fruitage, the resultant. Mem- 
ory does not stand on its own feet, so to speak. It cannot in 
itself be cultivated. Memory training, at least, is a misnomer. 
Memory never has been trained and never will be trained. It 
is a resultant and not a process. In training children in accu- 
racy and speed in addition, the training comes in the process of 
arriving at the answer and not in the answer itself. Individuals 
vary greatly in their power of retentiveness, due to difference in 
nervous plasticity, which cannot be changed. 
The problem of good retaining for a given individual is noth- 
ing more or less than the problem of good getting. In general, 
good getting consists of two things only—the application of the 
subject under consideration to all sides of the learner, and the 
application of all sides of the subject to the learner. This prin- 
ciple must not be overlooked. Some subjects lend themselves 
to much more varied treatment than others. The wise teacher 
will see the limitations of each. 
First, then, as far as possible, the subject should appeal to 
all sides of the student. Many city-born and bred children, 
while in school, know the definitions and uses of our common 
agricultural plants, and many of them know, in a general way, 
plant distribution throughout the world; but their information, 
if such it may be called, does not stick, and we say they do not 
remember well. Our diagnosis is wrong. They did not in the 
first place member [divide into parts] well. If the subject had 
been taught in such a way as to appeal to all sides of the pupil, 
he would not have forgotten it. He could not have forgotten it. 
If he could have seen, tasted, smelled, and handled these agri- 
cultural products, and actually have witnessed the use to which 
they could be put, if the processes of preparation had been 
adequate, the information would have stuck. He could not by 
any effort have forgotten it. And then we should say that he 
remembers well, which of course is true; but the large truth is 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
that he had membered it well in the getting, with the result that 
he could not forget it. Memory is a resultant. Good holding 
depends upon good getting. 
Second, all sides of the subject under consideration should be 
presented to the student if we expect him to grasp it, and so 
retain it. The learner should see the thing in all its relations— 
the relations of place, time, cause and effect, whole and part. 
Much of the history work in schools, for example, is lost because 
each subject is taken up as a separate, isolated topic in no way 
related to what has gone before or to what follows; and then 
pupils are credited with having poor memories for history. We 
expect them to remember things which had never been mem- 
bered. We expect them to hold things which they never had. 
‘We expect them to retain things which they had never attained. 
As the Constitution of the United States is usually taught in 
our public schools, not one in a thousand remembers a single 
thing that is worth while. He has not known anything worth 
while. He may have committed the document to memory as 
he would a declamation, but that is far from knowing it. To 
know a thing is to get it in its relations. What were the forces 
which made the Constitution, and what the forces which it made? 
What was peculiar to the place and time which made it prac- 
tically inevitable? Of what larger movement is it a part and 
what are the important parts or phases of it as a movement? 
A presupposition for remembering the Constitution is that it 
should have been known, and a necessary condition for knowing 
it is that it should have been seen in its relations. All sides of it 
should have appealed to the learner. The Constitution must be 
seen as the general instrument of government resulting from 
hundreds of years of conflict and development. In it must be 
seen the old navigation laws, the Stamp Act and its repeal, the 
Mutiny Act, the Colonial and Continental Congresses, the Boston 
Tea Party, the Boston Massacre, Lexington and Concord, Bunker 
Hill, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confed- 
eration, the numerous attempts to remodel the Articles, Valley 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  HOW TO HELP YOUR MEMORY 185 
Forge, the surrender at Yorktown. Unless these things ean be 
seen as contributing finally to this result, the spirit and genius, 
and therefore the significance, of the Constitution are lost; it 
is not comprehended and so is not retained. 
And likewise the significance of the Constitution cannot be 
comprehended unless we know it as the instrument of govern- 
ment under which our history as a nation has been made. The 
questions which have arisen in our national history are to be 
determined in the light of this general instrument of govern- 
ment, and the Constitution itself can be understood only as we 
see its mark upon all important questions of state since its 
adoption. The only way to know a law fully is to make it 
operative. So it is with the Constitution, the general law of the 
land. It not only stands as the great generalized effect of the 
years that had gone before, but it stands out as the great semi- 
eause of the events which followed. The Kentucky and the 
Virginia Resolutions, the Hartford Convention, the Missouri 
Compromise, the Monroe Doctrine, the Acts of Nullification, the 
Wilmot Proviso, the Omnibus Bill, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, 
the Dred Scott Decision, the Act of Secession, Reconstruction, 
the Income Tax, are all constitutional questions, and no one can 
know the Constitution who does not see its marks on all such 
questions. 
This illustration has been given thus fully, not as a lesson in 
history, but in order to show what is meant by presenting a topic 
in its relations. The purpose is to illustrate one phase of mem- 
ory, viz., that good holding depends upon good getting; and 
that one phase of good getting consists in presenting to the 
learner the subject under consideration in as many of its rela- 
tions as possible. 
Other things being equal, vividness, recency, and repetition 
in presentation strengthen retention. Through vividness, one 
remembers his first sunset at sea. The emotional tone was such 
that the experience burned itself in at once, never to be lost— 
because of the way in which it was obtained. Recency is an 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
important factor only in that things have not had time to fade 
out since their acquirement, and repetition means nothing more 
than getting the same thing over and over again. 
If good getting, full comprehension, is the secret of good 
retention, it becomes apparent at once how important it is that 
the avenues for the transmission of the raw stuff of information 
should be kept in their normal state. The learner’s eyes and 
ears should receive special care, for these are fundamental; 
they are the presuppositions of all intelligence. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Problems for Class Work 
1. Approach something you need to remember from several different 
angles. For example, the seven factors of study as set forth by 
MeMurry in Chapter I are these: purposing, supplementing, organiz- 
ing, evaluating, memorizing, utilizing, questioning. 
(a) Write out the meaning of each; then, if you feel the need, 
turn back, reread MeMurry’s article (page 21), to verify 
or correct your definitions. You have approached the 
problem of remembering from the viewpoint of review, 
or stating in your own words in written expression, and 
of verification by rereading. 
(b) Think now of the story of investigations of yellow fever 
as told by McMurry: the need, the experiments, the 
hypothesis, the testing, the results. Try to substitute the 
story of some other scientific investigation in each of 
the respects related by McMurry. Recall that the yellow- 
fever story illustrated at least some of the factors of 
study. You have approached the meaning of some of the 
factors of study from the viewpoint of exemplification. 
(c) Think now of your original estimate of your own ability 
as a student in the light of MceMurry’s seven factors. 
Where were you weak and where strong? You have 
approached the meaning from the viewpoint of applica- 
tion to yourself. :

                                  2. It will be easier to approach from several angles another set of 
facts which needs to be remembered. Take the Lincoln “Gettysburg 
Address,” which you probably already know by heart. Apply Mr. 
Bryan’s principle of “right getting” by approaching from several 
angles, and by thinking about the meaning of the passage. 
(a) The historical setting: place, time, immediate event, audi- 
ence. 
(b) Preparation: how made, where. 
(c) Comparison: with Edward Everett’s two-hour address on 
the same occasion; with the second inaugural address. 
(da) Thinking about significant phrases: “conceived in liberty,” 
“all men created equal,” “government of the people, by 
the people.” 
(e) Story of the great Civil War crisis at Gettysburg, said to 
be the turning point of the war. 
(f) How long the war lasted after the address. 
3. Prepare a similar plan of approaching from several points of 
view a problem of your own in science, in civies, or in English literature. 
4. Tell about an event or series of events in history which you remem- 
ber well because you “membered” it thoroughly, as Mr. Bryan suggests. 
5. On the basis of these exercises hold a class discussion upon the 
topic: “Good getting helps good keeping in our school work.” 
Problems for Work in the Classroom 
1. Prepare for a class test in memory. Choose a stanza of about eight 
or ten lines. Let each try carefully to recall it after three readings. 
All may close books and write. Those who fail should read the stanza 
again; then write. See how many of you can be perfect after five 
readings, with appropriate writing attempts. 
2. Let all learn a stanza. At some unexpected time a few weeks 
later, let the class write the stanza from memory. Compare results. 
3. What is the chief value of “outlining” a chapter which you need 
to master? Work out on the board an outline of one of the earlier 
selections in this book. 
4. A class committee may find two passages of about equal difficulty, 
make a careful outline of one on the blackboard, and read the two 
passages to the elass, giving the listeners a chance to study the out- 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 READING TO UNDERSTAND 
line of the passage first read, but no opportunity to see an outline of 
the second. Test your memory of the two passages two or three days 
later. 
5. Give data from your school life showing that what you remember 
in one study helps you remember in a second study. Indicate the 
importance of this fact in your work as students. 
6. A narrative is relatively easy to remember because the incidents 
of the story grow out of each other; each is tied up readily with the 
preceding. On the contrary, an explanation of a science problem or of 
eivie duties is harder to remember because the parts are not related in 
“story” sequence. A narrative poem is easier to learn by heart than 
a descriptive poem. Tell about concrete experience from your school 
work to support these statements and to drive home the truth that 
remembering depends upon seeing the relationship of ideas. 
7. A good speaker always bears in mind the fact that the average 
listener can remember only a few points. He uses great care in organiz- 
ing his talk around one, two, or three major ideas, depending on the 
time at his disposal. These carefully selected major ideas are the most 
important elements of his thinking that he wants his hearers to remem- 
ber. His skill can be measured further by the force of the illustrations 
or the concrete material he uses to drive home each of his major ideas. 
Apply these two tests to an address in your school assembly. Apply 
them to the next topical recitations in any of your courses. Make oral 
or written reports of your observations as directed. 
8. Select a chapter from one of your textbooks in history or in social 
science. Set aside one class period for intensive application. Apply 
these principles: (i) Resolve to remember the essentials, (ii) Pause to 
understand each, (iii) See how they are related to each other, (iv) Say 
each aloud before you leave it, fixing a catchword in mind, (v) Apply 
the points to current problems, (vi) Finish with a vivid final review, 
closing your books. Possibly your class can plan a laboratory exercise 
for the English period of one day, and test the value of the work on 
the following day. All would need to make it a point of honor. to 
refrain from studying or talking of the lesson outside the class period. 
9. Better remembering by better thinking. As to the memorizing of 
faets by actors, Professor James says: 
What it has done for them is to improve their power of studying a 
part systematically. Their minds are now full of precedents in the way   
-P-A-G-E-189
  
HOW TO HELP YOUR MEMORY 189 
of intonation, emphasis, gesticulations; the new words awaken distinct 
suggestions and decisions; are caught up, in fact into a preéxisting 
network, like the merchant’s prices or the athlete’s store of records, 
and are recollected easier, although the mere native tenacity is not a 
whit improved, and is usually, in fact, impaired by age. 
It is a case of better remembering by better thinking. Similarly 
when schoolboys improve by practice in ease of learning by heart, the 
improvement will, I am sure, be always found to reside in the mode of 
study of the particular piece (due to the greater interest, the greater 
suggestiveness, the generic similarity with other pieces, the more sus- 
tained attention), and not at all to any enhancement of the brute 
retentive power.’     
   
   
                  
       
      
           
   
      
   How does this statement bear out the central theme of the present 
chapter? 
10. Mark Twain says that a “freak” memory is a great misfortune. 
“To it all occurrences are of the same size. Its possessor cannot dis- 
tinguish an interesting cireumstance from an uninteresting one. More- 
over, he cannot stick to his subject. He picks up every grain of mem- 
ory he discerns in his way and so is led aside.” Can you cite cases of 
freak memories which illustrate Mark Twain’s point? 
11. To associate the new ideas which one is trying to remember with 
old ideas already well established in his mind is the very essence of 
effective remembering. For example, several literary people were born 
in the year 1809; among them, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Edgar 
Allan Poe. Assume that this fact is fixed in mind. Then, if one is try- 
ing to recall the date of Tennyson’s birth, finding that it is 1809, he 
immediately associates the three poets in the respect named. In this 
case the association is very close indeed, and memory of 1809 is prob- 
lably fixed permanently, especially if he recalls that 1809 is the date of 
Abraham Lincoln’s birth. 
Association may be fixed also by contrast. Suppose that you know 
he characteristics of Poe’s poetry. Upon reading Tennyson’s, you find 
fundamental differences and dwell upon them in your own thought, 
sing your estimate of Poe as a contrasting standard. The memory of 
ach poet’s work is likely to be strengthened. Can you illustrate this by 
‘iting contrasts between any two poets you have been studying? All 
your studies in school should furnish abundant illustrations of this 
sential feature of memory. Discuss examples.

12. Let each student bring to class a cartoon or an illustration from 
an advertisement about something worth remembering. Have someone 
show them all to the group. Decide which three are most likely to help - 
readers recall. Select also the ideas represented most worthy of reten- 
tion. It often happens that worthy ideas are much less effectively 
presented than far less worthy ideas. 
Topics: Five Minute Talks 
Plan a three to five-minute talk upon one of these topies:

. The things I remember without effort. 
Interesting “memory devices.” 
When thinking aided my memory. 
A “freak” memory I know about. 
. The value of “key words” in remembering, exemplified. 
When I received a vivid first impression. 
When I was helped by tying up a lesson with some experience of 
my own. ‘ 
9. An annoying “lapse” of memory. 
10. An humiliating experience of learning words rather than ideas. 
11. A name or a place or a date that persists in my memory. Why? 
12. Why “power” rather than “knowledge” is the goal of our study. 
13. Knowing, but unable to recall; an example. 
14. A memory “association” that never failed me. 
15. Key words for a recent lesson or for a lesson of the immediate 
future. 
16. Selecting what to remember vs. trying to remember everything. 
Explain. 
17. A memory that is filled with useless “junk. 
my own mind. 
. A “post-office” memory vs. an “edited periodical” memory. 
. “Membering”’ well in order to remember well. 
. Diagrams that helped me to remember. 
. Recall a cartoon that you have admired. Tell why you remem. 
bered it. 
. Approaching a memory problem from two or three different ang! 
. When a good “forgettery” was an asset.

  CHAPTER FIVE 
READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
Reading is a copartnership. What we receive from it is in 
the nature of dividends on a joint investment. 
—KERFOOT. 
SECTION I 
SUPPLEMENTING AN AUTHOR’S THOUGHT 
Earlier chapters have developed the necessity of reading with 
objectives or purposes in mind; have explained the necessary 
types of skill which a good student employs in grasping the 
author’s main idea and its various subdivisions; and have indi- 
eated skills important in remembering and reproducing thought. 
The present chapter turns to still another essential feature of 
the habits of a capable worker. We are to consider the reader’s 
duty of helping the writer by “supplementing the thought,” as 
MeMurry says (page 25). 
In forcible words, Ruskin has pointed out the intensely active 
side of reading: 
And be sure, also, if the author is worth anything, that you 
will not get at his meaning all at once—nay, that at his whole 
meaning you will not for a long time arrive in any wise. Not 
that he does not say what he means, and in strong words, too; 
but he cannot say it all, and what is more strange, will not, but 
in a hidden way, and in parable, in order that he may be sure 
you want it. I cannot quite see the reason of this, nor analyze 
the cruel reticence in the breasts of wise men which makes them 
always hide their deeper thought. 
They do not give it you by way of help, but of reward, and 
will make themselves sure that you deserve it, before they allow 
you to reach it. 
193 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
But it is the same with the physical type of wisdom, gold. 
There seems, to you and me, no reason why the electric forces 
of the earth should not carry whatever there is of gold within 
it at once to the mountain tops, so that kings and people might 
know that all the gold they could get was there; and without any 
trouble of digging, or anxiety, or chance, or waste of time, cut 
it away, and coin as much as they needed. But Nature does not 
manage it so. She puts it in little fissures in the earth, nobody 
knows where. You may dig long and find none; you must dig 
painfully to find any. 
And it is just the same with men’s best wisdom. When you 
come to a good book, you must ask yourself, “Am I inclined to 
work as an Australian miner would? Are my pickaxes and 
shovels in good order, and am I in good trim myself, my sleeves 
well up to the elbow, and my breath good, and my temper?” 
And keeping the figure a little longer, the metal you are in 
search of being the author’s mind or meaning, his words are as 
the rock which you have to crush and smelt in order to get at 
it. And your pickaxes are your own care, wit, and learning; 
your smelting furnace is your own thoughtful soul. Do not 
hope to get at any good author’s meaning without those tools 
and that fire; often you will need sharpest, finest chiseling and 
patientest fusing before you can gather one grain of the metal.’ 
Another powerful statement of the contributive activity of a 
good reader is found in an interview which Edward Bok reports 
that he had while still a boy with the great preacher Phillips 
Brooks. Bok, left alone in Mr. Brooks’s library, had been gazing 
with respect upon the many books he saw about him. When Mr. 
Brooks returned, he said: 
“I am glad you had such respect for my dumb friends [his 
books]. For they are my friends, each one of them,” he con- 
tinued as he looked fondly at the filled shelves. “Yes, I know 
them all, and love each for its own sake. Take this little vol- 
ume,” and he picked up a little volume of Shakespeare. “Why, 
we are the best of friends; we have traveled miles together—all 
over the world, as a matter of fact. It knows me in all my 
moods, and responds to each, no matter how irritable I am. 
Yes, it is pretty badly marked up now, for a fact, isn’t it?

book look any better to the eye. But it means more to me 
because of all that penciling. 
“Now, some folks dislike my use of my books in this way. 
They love their books so much that they think it nothing short 
of sacrilege to mark up a book. But to me, that’s like having 
a child so prettily dressed that you can’t romp and play with 
it. What is the use of a good book, I say, if it is too pretty for 
use? I like to have my books speak to me, and then I like to 
talk back to them. 
‘“Take my Bible here,’’ he continued, as he took up an old and 
much-worn copy of the book. “I have a number of copies of the 
Great Book: one copy I preach from; another I minister from; 
but this is my own personal copy, and into it I talk and talk. 
See how I talk,” and he opened the book and showed interleaved 
pages full of comments in his handwriting. “There’s where St. 
Paul and I had an argument one day. Yes, it was a long argu- 
ment, and I don’t know who won,” he added smilingly. “But 
then no one ever wins in an argument, anyway; do you think 
Sot 
Mr. Brooks’s debates with St. Paul on the margins of his 
Bible probably consisted largely of the fourth or the fifth type 
of marginal comments suggested by Hall-Quest in the quotation 
which follows. Hall-Quest says that the margins of a book one 
owns have a double purpose. They are generally included in 
printed material for esthetic reasons and for the necessities of 
the printing press. In addition, he indicates that they should 
serve as the depository of a certain share of the reader’s contri- 
bution to the reading process. He refers to such comments as 
Mr. Brooks wrote on the margins of his Bible in his debate with 
St. Paul. Hall-Quest’s suggestions about the nature of marginal 
notes in textbooks are these: 
First, the summary of each paragraph. If the pupil is trained 
to write along the side of each paragraph a brief summary of 
its main thought, he will save much time in his studying. 
Second, references to related material in the same book or 
elsewhere. 
Third, questions that arise during the reading and that must 
be jotted down at once lest they vanish.

  196 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
Fourth, criticisms of the author's thought, points of view 
different from the author’s, the pupil’s fresh reaction to the 
subject-matter. 
Fifth, new thoughts, suggestions, large questions that are des- 
tined, perhaps to stimulate the young man or young woman into 
serious plans of great living.* 
It is appropriate to speak of three types of supplementing 
skill in performing the reader’s share of the reading process. 
(A) Keep the mind alert, constantly asking questions of the 
writer. Of course, we do not mean petty questions like ‘““Why 
did you write this stuff?” or “How old were you when you 
wrote?” We have in mind, rather, vital questions like these: 
“How does the point you are now making tie up with the preced- 
ing?” “What does it add to your central idea?” “What proof 
or illustration will you advance to make good the general state- 
ment you have just made?” “How will you surmount this 
difficulty, Mr. Blank?” 
To be more specific: We might indicate the two types of ques- 
tions in reading the first division of Mr. Foster’s “Should Stu- 
dents Study?” in Chapter I. Read the first page of Mr. Foster’s 
article, page 36.

SUPPLEMENTING AN AUTHOR’S THOUGHT 197 
In all probability a reader would not ask Mr. Foster so many 
even of the vital questions. Nevertheless, he should anticipate 
certain very important matters upon which he has a right to 
expect information. In an article which urges him to purchase 
a set of books, or to support extensive civic improvements, or 
to attend a well-known college, the reader has a right to ask 
about the recency of the books, or the cost of the improvements, 
or the housing conditions of the college. 
A word of caution is in place here, suggested by the statement 
of a student who was being trained to ask questions of books. 
He said, “I am always so busy asking the questions you advise 
that I forget what I am reading.” Exactly. He was probably 
not distinguishing between futile questions and vital questions. 
And of the latter, he was probably asking too many. 
(B) Help the writer by recalling experiences of your own 
which corroborate his statements. Doubtless you did exactly 
that when you read Dewey’s article describing the five steps 
in reflective thinking, or Mr. Foster’s “Should Students Study ?” 
Mr. Dewey tells of being far from his destination, with a limited 
time to keep an appointment, and of various alternatives that 
suggested themselves. You may never have been in a situation in 
New York City exactly identical with that reported by Mr. Dewey ; 
but you, like other human beings who regard engagements as 
important, have been in somewhat similar situations of possible 
tardiness. As you read about Mr. Dewey’s predicament, your 
own similar experience flashed through your mind. “Yes, that 
is so,” you said. In like manner, when Mr. Foster told you 
of the success or failure of high-school students on the basis of 
scholarship, you did not know personally any of the people to 
whom he referred. But you were thinking, “in the back of 
your mind,” as we say, of your own acquaintances whose expe- 
riences, you know, corroborate Mr. Foster’s conclusions. i 
In this connection, it is pertinent to note how much ean go 
on in the back of an active mind in very brief flashes. You did 
not think out in full your own experience of anticipating tardi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
ness when you were reading Mr. Dewey’s predicament of the 
same kind. You had merely a flash of memory—late for the 
party—ten minutes to get to school—the missed rehearsal. While 
you were reading of good scholarship in Mr. Foster’s article, you 
may have thought of certain of your schoolmates momentarily : 
“That’s John,” or “Mary, for all the world,” you thought as you 
read on. Thus we see that the process of reading is an active 
contributive process, in which the reader supplies data out of 
his own life and thinking. And these data flash through the 
reader’s mind in extremely abbreviated form. Very frequently, 
it is a good plan deliberately to stop reading when, in your 
studying, a flash of thought thus comes to your mind, and to 
give that supplementing thought a free chance to develop as 
far as it will. 
(C) Help the writer by thinking of examples of your own 
which differ from those he writes about., Contrast is a very 
effective method of bringing out meaning. This is particularly 
true in much of your reading that has to do with geography or 
community life, civics, and history. Suppose, for instance, you 
have lived all your life in the Mississippi Valley. With the 
topography, the industries, the transportation, and the products 
of at least a small portion of this region, you are familiar. When 
you read of the geography of Norway, of Switzerland, or even 
of our Rocky Mountain states, you understand the details better 
because, almost unconsciously, you are supplying the writer with 
a background of knowledge which furnishes a sharp contrast 
with what he is saying. So, too, in reading about life in the 
slums, perhaps in that excellent book of Jacob Riis’s, How the 
Other Half Lives, you helped the writer by furnishing contrasts 
from your own comfortable homes, and clean parts of your city. 
Of course it is quite possible to help the writer by recalling 
both differing and similar experiences. You may have been in 
a position to witness scenes similar to those he describes, and at 
the same time may have in your own life a startling contrast of 
conditions. If so, you are a good reader in this respect at least ;   
-P-A-G-E-199
      SUPPLEMENTING AN AUTHOR’S THOUGHT 199 
and the more supplementary experience you have to draw upon, 
the better reader you are. Indeed, one of the very best tests of 
effective reading is to be able, when you have finished, to repeat 
the general thought of the writer, and to supply the data for 
your report, not from the pages of his book, but from your own 
experience. 
It would be very natural to use the idea, “recalling differing 
experiences” as a means of perpetually finding fault with the 
writer’s conclusion. One should not be a ferret, prying ecuri- 
ously into various paragraphs to find something to seize upon; 
he should, none the less, be a cautious reader. If some writer, 
especially in the public press, makes a statement which recalls 
to you no corroborating experiences, but on the contrary, sug- 
gests many experiences which have a radically different, mean- 
ing, it is your business as a good reader to question his state- 
ment. Indeed, if the conflicting or contradicting data you 
possess from your own life are ample and strong enough, as a 
good reader you should either hold the question unsettled or 
entirely reject the statement. 
One by-product of the main idea in this discussion may be 
expressed as another word of caution: a reader or listener must 
not allow his mind to go wandering off so far on a tangent, upon 
some line of thinking, fancy, or mere daydreaming, that he loses 
the thread of the discourse. When suddenly he comes back to the 
present he is lost, having missed the intermediate parts. To be 
sure, “woolgathering” is not quite so harmful in reading as it is 
in listening. However, it may cause great waste of time. In 
the article of Kerfoot, which follows in this chapter, there are 
many little human touches such as “we scuttle down the darkened 
aisle [of a movie theater] and slip into some vacant seats,” “like 
the jerking of a burned finger out of a flame,” “prejudices that 
we failed to rid ourselves of.”” Upon any one of these side lines a 
reader might let his mind run off at random, especially if he has 
just had an amusing experience finding seats, or a bitter experi- 
ence with a burn in the laboratory, or if he has a prejudice that     
   
                                 
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
will not down. Instead of dwelling on any such point, a flash 
should shoot through the reader’s mind, like the flutter of a 
picture on a reel through the motion-picture machine. These 
brief flashes do not distract us from the forward movement of 
the thought or the main idea developed. 
An intelligent reader or listener holds his attention firmly 
upon the ideas presented which are in line with the central 
theme of the writer or speaker. His developed skills enable him 
to separate the vital from the relatively insignificant points. He 
is even able to neglect a part of the subordinate points, using 
the time to dwell upon the meaning of the significant. In con- 
trast, an unintelligent listener allows his mind to ramble off 
upon a side line, and becomes lost in vague and purposeless 
reverie, as he permits his attention to be directed with equal 
intensity to the relatively unimportant details and to the abso- 
lutely indispensable matters. 
We are, then, to develop our powers as readers by thinking of 
our duties as active partners of the authors whose books we read. 
Our share of the joint investment is liberal contributions from 
our own experiences. We may profitably ask of our partners 
pertinent questions and then look for their answers; we may 
summon from our own mental stock data which support and 
data which oppose their views. The dividends we are to reap 
depend to a very large extent upon what we do to and with the 
materials which writers place before us.

Reading Suggestions 
1. The following article by Mr. Kerfoot is a chapter from How to 
Read, a book which you will enjoy in its entirety. After you have read 
the chapter given here, go to the school or city library, and try to secure 
the book, if it is not in your classroom. Possibly your English instruc- 
tor will allow you to substitute it for one of your required home-reading 
books. 
2. Recall the principles of reading, and apply them consciously to 
this article: (a) read with a purpose, (b) grasp the author’s thought, 
(c) remember the leading thoughts, (d@) supplement the author's 
thought. 
3. Before you begin to read, write from memory the five skills for 
grasping the writer’s thought, the three skills for remembering, and the 
three skills for helping the writer. If you cannot recall the various 
skills, consult pages 159, 171, and 196 ff. When you have finished the 
reading of Kerfoot’s article, check the skills on your list which you are 
sure you employed. 
4. Recall the kinds of reading as explained in Chapter One, Sec- 
tion 1, page 14, and see if you can anticipate an answer to Mr. Ker- 
foot’s question, “When did you learn to read?” 
I 
A few months ago I happened to be present at a dinner where 
a chance question led to an interesting talk. Some phase of 
primary education was under discussion; and in the course of it 
the host, turning to one of the guests, asked, “When did you 
learn to read?” 
Prom J. B. Kerfoot’s How to Read, Chapter I. Reprinted by special permission of, and by special arrangements with, Houghton Mifilin Company. 
201  
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
“At three,” was the prompt reply, given with a touch of pride. 
“And you?” said the host to the next guest. 
“Oh, I don’t know. About five, I suppose.” 
“And you?” to a lady beyond. 
There was a moment’s embarrassed hesitation. And then, 
with something about scarlet fever, came the confession that she 
had not learned her letters till she was nine. 
And thus it went, halfway round the table. 
Now these replies were direct and pertinent answers to a 
technical question. Taken separately, they gave the exact infor- 
mation asked for. 
And yet, as they piled up, one after the other, there seemed 
to be something about them that I found myself vaguely 
resenting. 
It was not what they said. It was, rather, a discernible com- 
mon denominator of implication in their manner of saying it. 
It seemed as though these people were leaving out of account 
all the other-than-technical meanings of the phrase with which 
they dealt, not because they were consciously excluding these 
deeper meanings for the moment, but because they unconsciously 
ignored them at all times. 
There was a cumulative inflection of finality in their declara- 
tions. It almost sounded as though, in dealing with the primary- 
school meaning of “learning to read,” they felt that they had 
dealt with the whole meaning of that expression. And while it 
never entered my head at the moment that this was really true, 
the fact that it was somehow being made to appear true struck 
me as amusing. It struck me as amusing enough to call atten- 
tion to. And so, presently, when the host asked me when J had 
learned to read I answered with a smile that I was still learning. 
And to my utter astonishment it developed, in the chaffing 
and talk that followed, that no single member of that largely 
literary and more or less intellectual company had ever thought 
of the expression “learning to read” as having any other mean- 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
        LEARNING TO READ 203 
ing than the technical, primary-school meaning; that, namely, 
of learning the alphabet, learning to recognize words made out 
of the alphabet, learning the dictionary meanings of more, and 
more, and still more words, and thus learning to receive mes- 
sages sent by print or handwriting. 
No one of them, it turned out, had ever asked himself what 
it is, exactly, that we do when we read. No one of them had 
ever watched himself in the act of reading. And all of them, 
in consequence, had retained intact the careless assumption that 
reading is essentially a receptive process. They all looked upon 
it, let us say, as though print were a sort of silent telephone, 
into the end of which an author delivers a message, and from 
the other end of which (by simply “knowing how to read’) his 
audience receives it. 
Now, as a matter of fact this is not true at all. It is not even 
an inadequate statement of the facts; it is a misstatement of 
them. And when I had pointed out something of this—when 
I had, hurriedly, and to the poor best of my surprised unpre- 
paredness, mobilized a few arguments and illustrations in 
defense of what I had regarded as an axiom—we began, in the 
course of the give-and-take of the talk that followed, to make 
discoveries. And we continued, excitedly and joyously, to make 
them until 1:00 a. m. 
We discovered that the common-school definition of “learning 
to read” is so universally accepted as the whole definition, that, 
while almost every newspaper and magazine publishes regular 
articles on what to read, none of them, so far as any of us knew, 
ever publishes articles on how to read. We discovered that, 
while there is a whole literature of books about books—about 
what books it behooves us to read, and why it behooves us to 
read them, and what (according to the author) it behooves us 
to read into them—there is little or nothing in the whole litera- 
ture about literature that tells us anything at all about how we 
have to read books and what it is that we have to read into them.   
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
We discovered that reading, so far from being merely a recep- 
tive act, is a creative process; that it is “creative,” not simply in 
the more or less cant-sodden “artistic” sense, but in a biologie 
sense as well; that it is an active, largely automatic, purely 
personal, constructive functioning; that it is, indeed, a species 
of anabolism.t In short, that it is a form of living. And as 
this last expression will be found, as we proceed, progressively 
to absorb and adequately to sum up the essence of our successive 
conclusions, I will put it that it is this last “diseovery’—the 
discovery of reading as a form of living—that I propose to 
examine and hope to elucidate in the following pages. 
And now, having said this much by way of introduction— 
having, as it were, established a mental take-off—let us, like 
sensible swimmers, dive at once into the deepest pool that our 
preliminary subject affords.

I 
Until ten or twelve years ago, no man who ever lived could 
tell another man a story. 
From the beginning of time, right down until about ten years 
ago, no man ever lived who could tell another man a story. 
Moses couldn’t. Homer couldn’t. Chaucer couldn’t. The min- 
strels and minnesingers couldn’t. Dante couldn’t. Dickens 
eouldn’t. Even Conan Doyle couldn't. 
The best that the very best of them ever succeeded in doing 
was to trick, or to coax, or to compel their readers or their 
hearers into telling stories to themselves. 
“Pshaw!” you are very likely going to exclaim at this point. 
“Here is a man pretending to explain one idiotic statement by 
making another.” And perhaps it does look that way. But, 
before we continue the discussion, let us take a few minutes off 
and go to the movies.

That stirring photo-play “The Two Rattlesnakes” is on the 
bill. 
We scuttle down the darkened aisle and slip into some vacant 
seats near the front. 
There is a little hissing splutter overhead. A flickering green 
frame, with “Jim Meets a Rattler” inside it, springs into view 
on the dim curtain. And a moment later the entire audience, 
and we with them, have settled down into an eager, yet perfectly 
passive, receptivity, and are looking (through a hole in the 
darkness) at the arid slope of an Arizona sheep-ranch, where a 
cowboy with a lamb in his arms and an old ewe at his heels is 
picking his way down the rocky and cactus-grown hillside. On 
he comes, twisting and turning; near enough now for us to see 
the litheness of his limbs and his cheery eyes. Then, suddenly, 
there is a blur of motion at his feet. A snaky something 
launches its length and strikes for a second at his knee. Bewil- 
derment, horror, realization, chase each other across his face. 
We see him drop the lamb; snatch out a knife; rip away the 
eloth, slash the naked flesh; bend to suck the poison from the 
wound. We watch him make a tortion bandage from the ker- 
chief at his neck. We watch him start, limping, down the hill. 
We watch him waver, and stumble, and stop to rest with his 
hand on a bowlder. We watch him press on; and fall; and get 
up; and struggle on again. We see him fall, and fail to rise. 
We see him, with a last spurt of strength, pull his six-shooter 
from its holster; fire three slow shots in the air; and drop back 
into unconsciousness. And we see a little cloud of distant dust 
turn into the mounted figures of his friends; see them ride 
furiously up; leap to the ground; gather round him; examine 
his hurt; lift his inert body to a horse’s back, and ride away— 
just as the hole in the darkness disappears and we find ourselves 
back again in the dim-lit, crowded hall.

Do you happen to know how the movies are made? 
They begin, like any other piece of fiction, in the mind of a 
man who has told himself a story. Having done so, he under- 
takes, by means of a short piece of descriptive writing (called 
a scenario) to guide the imagination of his readers along the 
road his own imagination has followed. And this scenario is 
submitted to a movie manager, who, if he likes it, buys it and 
turns it over to his producing department. 
Now the producing department of a moving-picture concern 
is a remarkable establishment. It has a long list of actors at 
its beck and eall. It has storehouses full of stage properties. It 
has clothespresses full of costumes. It has a card index of 
“likely places.” It has a corps of mechanics to do its bidding. 
And when the scenario of an author’s story is turned over to 
the directing intelligence of this establishment, he chooses actors 
for it from his troupe. He supplies them with costumes from 
his cupboards. He draws stage properties from his stores. He 
selects scenes from his card index. He has his mechanics pro- 
vide effects that are not in stock. And finally, before the record- 
ing eye of the camera, he proceeds—vwell or ill according to his 
ability and his resources—to retell the author’s story in the 
concrete terms of his own equipment. 
And for us who sit in the audience his retelling—his reading 
of the story—is final. You may know a hillside far more pic- 
turesque than the one Jim comes down. But you cannot sub- 
stitute it, in your mind, for the movie-man’s hillside. The 
movie-man is reading the author’s story, not we. For the 
moment he stands, like St. Peter, at the gates of our imagina- 
tions. What he chooses is chosen. What he puts in is in. What 
he leaves out is out. 
He is the first man who has told another man a story since 
the world began. 
“But,” you are perhaps exclaiming, “how then about the 
others? How about Virgil? And Cervantes? And Balzac? 
And—Marie Corelli?”   
-P-A-G-E-207
  LEARNING TO READ 207 
Every one of them, from the least to the greatest, has but 
written for the movies. 
Not for the movies of the photo-theater, but for the movies 
of our minds. 
For a novel is nothing but an elaborate scenario. And each 
of us is a moving-picture concern. 
‘When we examine a book at a bookstore; when we look at the 
opening sentences, and read a snatch of conversation on page 
247, and turn back to the last page to see how it all ends—a 
scenario has been submitted to the manager.. When we pay 
down our $1.35, or present our library card to be stamped, we 
have purchased the local rights in it. And when we switch on 
our electric reading-lamp, and stretch out in our favorite chair, 
and open the book at the first chapter, we turn the tale over 
to our producing department. 
And the producing department of a human moving-picture 
concern is also a remarkable establishment. 
All the people we have ever known, plus thousands we have 
spoken to, or crossed eyes with in a crowd, or watched in public 
places, or merely glimpsed in passing, are actors at its beck and 
call. And it can, moreover, pick and choose, not only among 
these actors, but among their attributes. It can, and that in the 
twinkling of an eye, take a chance expression on the face of 
one’s best friend, the body of a blacksmith seen years since at 
a country crossroad, the mustache of yesterday’s organ-grinder, 
and the eyes of last year’s cotillion leader, and cast the composite 
of them (together with the composite suggestion of personality 
that results) as the villain of a piece. 
It, too, has memory storehouses full of stage properties; 
mental cupboards crammed with costumes; a brain-cell index of 
likely places. It, too, has a marvelous mechanic, called Imagi- 
nation, that contrives effects that are not in stock out of odds 
and ends of raw material. 
And when a story-teller’s scenario is submitted to it, the 
directing mind of this establishment—contriving, as they are 
needed, actors from this troupe; stage properties from these

stores; costumes from these cupboards; scenes from this cell 
catalogue—proceeds, paragraph by paragraph, and page by 
page, before the estimating eye of our intelligence, and well or 
ill according to its ability and its resources, to retell the author’s 
story in the recollective and imaginative and emotional terms 
of its own equipment. 
We 
Do you, by any chance, doubt this? 
If so, I have a confession to make. I have, deliberately and 
with malice aforethought, deceived you. The photo-play per- 
formance of “The Two Rattlesnakes” never took place. There 
never has been such a photo-play. 
I made that all up “as I went along,” as the children say. 
And I placed before you, not a story, but only the skeleton of a 
story—the merest dry bones of a half-finished scenario. 
Yet I'll warrant that in reading it you pictured to yourself 
a Jim of your own fancying, walking down a hillside of your 
own invention. 
Is it not so? 
Moreover, when you stop to consider it, you will see that this 
cannot be otherwise. 
The terms of one’s own equipment are the only terms in which 
a story can reach us. 
For the hero that the author imagined is forever invisible to 
us, no matter how minutely he describes him. And though we 
chance to live there, it is in owr Chicago, and not in his, that we 
stage that chapter of his tale. Indeed, if he describes a char- 
acter too minutely—if he keeps our minds too long from imagin- 
ing their own protagonists in the effort to imagine his—our 
minds end by shrugging their shoulders, going on strike, and 
refusing to imagine any. And it is for the same reason that 
we so often skip elaborate descriptions of scenery, and that 
meticulously? word-painted landscapes commonly prove invis- 
ible to the eyes of our imaginations. 
IMeticulously: very carefully.

Nor is it alone to the things of the senses that this inexorable 
law applies. It is the same with less tangible stage properties. 
When we are called upon to “register” horror, we have only our 
own brands of that emotion to register. When a mental attitude 
is asked of us, we can but place our own minds, like lay figures, 
in, or somewhere near, the posture demanded. And if the 
specifications of our author’s scenario include a spiritual reac- 
tion, we must either supply it, or a substitute for it, from the 
laboratory of our own spirit, or else pass on, saying in effect (as 
the motion-picture man would say in the vernacular), “Kill 
that soul stuff!” 
VI 
Shall we put it that we have now acquired the equipment 
necessary to read what follows? For that, after all, is what we 
really mean. 
We read, then, quite literally, with our own experience. We 
read with what we have seen and heard and smelled and tasted 
and felt. We read with the emotions we have had—with the love 
we have loved, the fear we have feared, the hate we have hated. 
We read with the observations we have made and the deductions 
we have drawn from them; with the ideas we have evolved and 
the ideals we have built into them; with the sympathies we have 
developed and the prejudices we have failed to rid ourselves 
of. 
“Learning to read” in the common-school sense—learning, let 
us put it, to read print and learning to read handwriting—has 
exactly as much (and exactly as little) to do with our reading 
of a novel as it has with Forbes-Robertson’s “reading” of 
Shakespeare. 
Learning to read, in the real sense, means enlarging our 
equipment, and learning creatively to use it. 
We receive in reading; but we receive, not directly by what 
the author tells us, but indirectly, by the new uses that he 
stimulates us into putting our experience to,

The truth is that our heads house other industries besides that 
of moving-picture making. And one of these is a distillery. 
Here the raw materials of crude experience—like, say, the 
jerking of a burned finger out of the flame—are treated by a 
secret process and “ideas’”—like the idea that fire is hot—are 
extracted from them. You cannot, as most of us know from 
experience, put the idea that fire is hot into a child’s head. 
The best that you can do is to supervise the delivery of the raw 
experience at the gate of the distillery. 
But we are more than distillers of low-grade ideas—of these 
comparatively crude, first-hand realizations. 
We are blenders and rectifiers of these as well. 
‘We combine two or more of them and from the mixture we 
distill a sublimated extract—the idea, say, of a resemblance. 
‘We combine a number of these ideas of resemblance and from 
the blend distill a still more rarefied essence—the idea, say, 
of a generalization. And each of these ideas—each of these 
home-made products of our distillery—becomes a permanent 
item of our stock in trade. Each of them is, so to say, stored 
away in its own bottle, ready for use in our further ex- 
periments. 
And these further experiments—these combinings of ideas 
that we have in stock—are by no means always made on our 
own initiative. They are often—-more often than otherwise— 
made on order, or by suggestion. 
Smith meets Jones in the subway and they have a little chat. 
Later, Smith says to his wife, “Keen chap, that Jones. He 
gave me a new idea today.” 
But of course he didn’t. 
What Jones gave him was a formula. 
He suggested that if Smith would take some of the Idea in 
Bottle 68, and some of the Idea in Bottle 7042, and mix them, 
he’d get such and such a result. And Smith did. And he got it. 
But, suppose Smith hadn't had the ingredients in stock?

Let us take our own case. 
When you began this chapter, you quite definitely didn’t have 
in your head several ideas that are now there. 
You didn’t, for instance, have in your head the idea that 
authors do not tell us stories; that they only issue instructions 
to us for telling ourselves stories; that they only write “sce- 
narios” for us to “produce.” 
How, then, did this idea get into your head? 
Not, certainly, by my putting it there. 
If you are inclined, for the moment, to think that I did this, 
you have only to turn back to Section IT of this chapter in order 
to see how you felt toward it, and what you thought of me, 
when I pretended to think that I could put this idea into your 
head. 
No. I didn’t put it there. I couldn’t. 
All that I could do was to furnish you, in the proper order, 
the various formulae needed for distilling it; to see that you 
were supplied, on occasion, with certain necessary raw mate- 
rials; and to stimulate you, from time to time, to make certain 
combinations out of these ingredients. 
I knew, for instance, that you were going to need the idea 
that there are two meanings to the expression “learning to 
read”; and I was afraid that you might not have this idea in 
stock. So I suggested that you take a number of ideas that I knew 
you could supply from stock—the ideas of an inquisitorial host ; 
of a series of guests, each of whom thought in his own way that 
he had learned to read, once for all, when he was a child; and 
of one guest who thought he hadn’t—I suggested that you take 
these simple ideas and mix them in a certain way. And you 
did as I suggested and got the desired result—the more complex 
idea. 
And I took pains to “stimulate you into making this new 
combination of ideas that were already on hand.” 
That was a part of my job as author.

I did it, in this case, by inducing you to dramatize the ideas; 
by inducing you to imagine people holding these ideas, or enact- 
ing them. In fine, I did it by inventing this dinner party; 
which, like the photo-play of “The Two Rattlesnakes,” never 
took place. 
But the dinner party and the photo-play were invented for 
entirely different reasons. In the latter case I knew that you 
were going to need the idea that we read in terms of our own 
equipment and not in terms of the author's equipment; and I 
was also afraid that you did not have this idea in stock. 
But this is an idea that is not easily derivable from the mixing 
of other, simpler ideas. This is an idea that we get best first- 
hand, from experience—by actually doing the thing and watch- 
ing ourselves do it. It is practically one of those realization- 
ideas, like the idea that fire is hot. Its extreme complexity is 
due to the extreme complexity of the experience itself. 
So I took measures to supply you with the experience. 
I wrote a scenario and I tricked you into “producing” it. 
And then, while the experience was fresh in your mind, I 
ealled your attention to what you had done. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Suggestions for Study 
1. Make a terse summary of Kerfoot’s leading ideas. 
2. We have an expression, “Reading between the lines.” What does 
it mean? Illustrate. 
3. Read something between these lines: 
(a) There is a garden in her face 
Where roses and white lilies show. 
(b) Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, 
As the swift seasons roll! 
(c) If it be a sin to covet honor, 
I am the most offending soul alive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    LEARNING TO READ 
(a) The heights by great men reached and kept 
Were not attained by sudden flight, 
But they, while their companions slept, 
Were toiling upward in the night. 
(e) Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; 
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. 
4. Write out from memory two lines of poetry; exchange with a 
classmate and let each try to read between the lines. 
5. Place several little “Stop, Look, Listen” signs on the margins of 
Kerfoot’s article. Stop, look, and listen to what is going on in your 
own mind at any of these signs. Write down what you are contribut- 
ing to the thought at three of these signs. 
6. On a frosty morning you may see your window apparently cov- 
ered with snow-capped mountains, frozen lakes, whitened forests. 
Explain why you see winter scenes. Why do different people see dif- 
ferent objects in the moon? 
7. It is said that certain Eskimos visiting London saw nothing of 
interest in the streets of that city. Explain why this might be true. 
8. “He brings most away from an art gallery who takes most to it.” 
What story does this little scenario enable you to tell to yourself? 
9. Great tragedies: 
(a) A woman with a rag-time capacity, attending grand opera. 
(b) A man with a dime-novel capacity, given Hamlet for a 
Christmas present. 
(c) A person with a Sunday-supplement capacity, privileged 
to spend a day in a great art gallery. 
(d) A man with Chautauqua privileges, possessing a Coney 
Island taste. 
(e) A man with great abilities, in a mediocre position.     
        
    Can you name other similar ones? 
  10. An American, visiting the wonderful natural history museum in 
London, heard another American tourist exclaim: “Them little snakes! 
They ought to see our snakes in the United States!” Can you match the 
illustration of limited contributing capacity? 
11. Prepare a set of vital questions which you would ask the author 
of your next selection in the literature class. If you prefer, choose a 
reading you must do for one of your other classes. 
     
         
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
12. In your next class in which oral reports are being presented, jot 
down one idea contributed by your own mind as each pupil speaks. 
13. Listen to an assembly speaker, a preacher, or any other public 
speaker. Write down in rough notes two sets of data: first, what was 
said that you received; second, what was not said that you contributed. 
Pay special attention to your share of the partnership. 
14. Looking back over the text as much as you please, prepare three 
questions, pertinent to Mr. Kerfoot’s main thought, which you might 
ask him if he were here. 
15. Did any questions arise in your mind as you read Kerfoot which 
were answered before you had finished the article? Explain. 
16. It is especially true that one who is presenting an argument to 
readers or to listeners needs to anticipate the questions which doubtful 
or opposing people in his audience will ask. One test of good argu- 
mentative writing or speaking is the presence in the argument itself of 
jast such anticipatory questions, with their answers. A good debater 
often uses sentences with beginnings like these: “But I hear someone 
objecting that »’ “A careful person will doubtless inquire at this 
point 7’ “Does anyone hesitate to believe that ——?” Explain 
why such sentences are indicative of a skillful debater. 
17. About the best example in American literature of a writer en- 
deavoring to anticipate and answer the queries and doubts of his read- 
ers is found in Lincoln’s “First Inaugural Address.” Almost the entire 
speech moves forward by the replies Lincoln made to unspoken but 
inevitable objections on the part of many citizens. Look up the address 
to see how many objections Lincoln answers. In this connection read 
also Lincoln’s “Cooper Institute Address.” 
18. Recall at least one place in Kerfoot’s article at which you sum- 
moned up either a similar experience or a contrasting experience of your 
own. The easy example of course will be a movie in which you told 
yourself the story. Try to avoid this example. These phrases from 
Kerfoot are better for the present problem: 
“Before the recording eye of the camera.” 
“When we pay down our $1.35.” 
“We read with what we have tasted.” 
19. Turn back to the discussion about the preparation of good read- 
ing cards, pages 71-73. How does that advice fit in with the central 
idea of Kerfoot’s article?

PEOPLE READ BOOKS? 
ALFRED KREYMBORG 
People read books. 
They go to the play. 
People hie to operas and museums. 
Not that they read books, go to the play, hie to operas and 
museums ; 
But that they go to themselves, read themselves, hear themselves, 
see themselves. 
They don’t like what they don’t read of themselves, hear of 
themselves, see of themselves. 
They have a tendency to think that bad, 
And so to express themselves. 
They like what they read of themselves, hear of themselves, see 
of themselves. 
Have a tendency to think this good, 
And so to express themselves. 
People cannot read what they cannot read, hear what they can- 
not hear, see what they cannot see. 
One stands in front of a glass, sees what one sees, cannot see 
what one cannot see. 
But a looking-glass is monotonous. 
Liking oneself monotonous. 
One must vary the glass and the liking. 
The liking-glass. 
So people read books, 
Go to the play, 
Hie to operas and museums, 
Say how-do-you-do to themselves,

1. Compare the meaning of “People Read Books” with Mr. Kerfoot’s 
statement that no one ever told anyone else a story, page 204. 
2. Why is “People Read Books” well written? What principle of 
Part I of this chapter does it illustrate? 
3. Find any good cartoon and read it. Display it to the class and 
explain what your contribution was. 
4. State in your own words what people do when they read books.

TRANSLATING LITERATURE INTO LIFE* 
ARNOLD BENNETT 
Reading Suggestions 
1. Arnold Bennett maintains that there is no value in reading a book 
unless it leads you to do something. See how he develops this theme, 
and consider whether or not you agree with him. 
2. In general, are you an “active” or a “passive” reader? You will 
have abundant opportunities to be “active,” to make contributions, as 
you read Mr. Bennett’s short article. Try to do so. Keep a brief 
record of your thinking in thé form of notes for class discussion. 
Lo, a parable! A certain man, having bought a large, elab- 
orate, and complete manual of carpentry, studied it daily with 
much diligence and regularity. Now there were no cupboards. 
in his house; his dining-table consisted of an arrangement of 
orange boxes, and he had scarcely a chair that was not a menace 
to the existence of the person who sat upon it. When asked 
why he did not set to work, and, by applying the principles of 
the manual, endeavor to improve the conditions of his life and 
of the lives of his wife and children, he replied that he was a- 
student, and he plunged more deeply than ever into the manual 
of carpentry. His friends at length definitely came to the con- 
clusion that though he was an industrious student, he was also 
a hopeless fool. 
By which I wish to indicate that there is no virtue in study 
by itself. Study is not an end, but a means. I should blush 
to write down such a platitude, did I not know by experience 
that the majority of readers constantly ignore it. The man who

pores over a manual of carpentry and does naught with it is a 
fool. But every book is a manual of carpentry, and every man 
who pores over any book whatever and does naught else with it 
is—deserving of an abusive epithet. What is the object of read- 
ing unless something definite comes of it? You would be better 
advised to play billiards. Where is the sense of reading history 
unless you obtain from it a clearer insight into actual polities and 
render yourself less liable to be duped by the rhetoric of party 
propaganda? Where is the sense of reading morals unless your 
own are improved? Where is the sense of reading biography 
unless it is going to affect what people will say about you after 
your funeral? Where is the sense of reading poetry or fiction 
unless you see more beauty, more passion, more scope for your 
sympathy, than you saw before? 
If you boldly answer: “I only read for pleasure,” then I 
retort that the man who drinks whisky might with force say: 
“T only drink whisky for pleasure.” And I respectfully request 
you not to plume yourself on your reading, nor expect to acquire 
merit thereby. 
But should you answer: “I do try to translate literature into 
life,” then I will ask you to take down any book at random 
from your shelves and conduct in your own mind an honest 
inquiry as to what has been the effect of that particular book 
on your actual living. If you can put your hand on any subse- 
quent period, or fractional moment, of your life and say: “I 
acted more wisely then, I wasn’t such a dupe then, I perceived 
more clearly then, I felt more deeply then, I saw more beauty 
then, I was kinder then, I was more joyous then, I was happier 
then, than I should have been if I had not read that book”— 
if you can honestly say this, then your reading of that book has 
not been utterly futile. But if you cannot say this, then the 
chances are that you have been studying a manual of carpentry 
while continuing to sit on a three-legged chair and to dine off 
an orange box. 
You say: “I know all that. But it is not so easy to translate 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
TRANSLATING LITERATURE INTO LIFE 219 
literature into life.” When I think of the time I have wasted 
in reading masterpieces, I stand aghast. 
The explanation is simple. Idleness, intellectual sloth, is the 
explanation. Self-coneeit is the explanation. If you were invited 
to meet a great writer, you would brace yourself to the occasion. 
You would say to yourself: “I must keep my ears open, and 
my brain wide-awake, so as to miss nothing.” You would tingle 
with your own bracing of yourself. But you—I mean “we' 
will sit down to a great book as though we were sitting down to 
a ham sandwich. No sense of personal inferiority in us! No 
mood of resolve! No “tuning up” of the intellectual apparatus! 
But just a casual, easy air, as if saying to the book: “Well, 
come along, let’s have a look at you!” 
What is the matter with our reading is casualness, languor, 
pre-oceupation. We don’t give the book a chance. We don’t 
put ourselves at the disposal of the book. It is impossible to 
read properly without using all one’s engine-power. If we are 
not tired after reading, common sense is not in us. How should 
one grapple with a superior and not be out of breath? 
But even if we read with the whole force of our brain, and 
do nothing else, common sense is still not in us, while sublime 
conceit is. For we are assuming that, without further trouble, 
we can possess, coordinate, and assimilate all the ideas and 
sensations rapidly offered to us by a mind greater than our own. 
The assumption has only to be stated in order to appear in its 
monstrous absurdity. Hence it follows that something remains 
to be done. This something is the act of reflection. Reading 
without subsequent reflection is ridiculous; it is equally a proof 
of folly and of vanity. 
Further, it is a sign of undue self-esteem to suppose that we 
ean grasp the full import of an author’s message at a single 
reading. I would not say that every book worth reading once 
is worth reading twice. But I would say that no book of great 
and established reputation is read till it is read at least twice. 
You can easily test the truth of this by reading again any

classic ; assuredly you will discover in it excellencies which had 
previously escaped you. 
To resume and finish: Open a great book in the braced spirit 
with which you would listen to a great man. Read with the 
whole of your brain and soul. Tire yourself (would you not 
tire yourself at tennis?). Reflect. After an interval, read 
again. By this process, and by no other, will a book enter into 
you, become a part of you, and reappear in your life. 
I have been consulted about the practice of making notes. 
Well, I do not care to offer counsels of perfection. My advice 
is simply to keep a pencil handy and to write down on a small 
sheet of paper (or in the inside back-cover if the book belongs 
to you) the number of the page on which anything has struck 
you, together with the merest hint, in half a dozen words, of 
what it was. If you do this, by the time you have finished the 
book, you will have automatically constructed a table and page- 
index of its salient points. It is well, of course, to write on the 
papers the title and author of the work, the name of the edition, 
and the date of perusal. <A collection of these small sheets of 
paper would constitute a souvenir of one’s reading. At the 
end of each year one might advantageously spend a few shillings 
in having the year’s harvest bound. Say you have read a hun- 
dred books. A hundred uniform leaves would make a respectable 
volume, whose interest and utility I need not insist upon. A 
row of such volumes would really amount to the secret history 
of one’s life. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Class Exercises 
1. Translate a real or an imaginary situation into a parable that will 
have the same general meaning as Bennett’s parable of the man who 
read diligently a manual of carpentry. 
2. Recall instances of your school life this year in which your instruc- 
tors (especially in the science laboratories) have translated into life 
materials found in a book.

3. Use for a “round-the-circle” discussion: “A book whic: led me to 
‘act more wisely,’ or ‘perceive more clearly,’ or ‘feel more deep!y,’ or 
‘see more beauty,’ or ‘be more kindly,’ or ‘decide more justly.’ ” 
4. “When I sat down to a book as if to a ham sandwich.” Have you 
done that with THz Minp at Work? Whose fault is it? 
5. Choose one passage in a piece of literature you are studying. Talk 
to the book, as Mr. Brooks did to his. (Page 195.) Read aloud your 
comments to see their wide variety. 
6. Apply the suggestion in Bennett’s last paragraph to your work on 
memory, Chapter IV. Experiment by trying it out with some book you 
think worth reading twice. 
7. Read Mr. Bennett’s last paragraph carefully. Secure copies of 
such blanks as the Royster Reading Report Blanks, Scott, Foresman 
and Company, and with their aid carry out Bennett’s final suggestion 
for a definite period of time. 
8. Defend reading for pleasure. 
9. What is the purpose of the initial or preliminary survey of a 
selection in the light of Bennett’s suggestions? 
10. Kerfoot thinks a good reader is an “anabolic” reader, one who 
builds up new ideas and meanings for himself. (See page 204.) In 
what sense is a good reader a “tearer down,” or “katabolic” reader? 
(Consult Bennett, page 218.) 
11. Explain, with examples, what you think the phrase “translate 
literature into life” means. 
12. Name a book which has made a contribution to you, explaining 
definitely what the contribution was.

LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET! 
C. ALPHONSO SMITH 
Reading Suggestions 
“Literature Can Give You an Outlet” is a part of the first chapter of 
a book which you ought to read entire. What Can Literature Do for 
Me? is probably in your library; it may be part of the equipment of 
your English classroom. From the personal style in which Mr. Smith 
writes, you can see that he talks intimately of the meaning of literature 
in terms of books which many of you have read. For the short extract 
presented here, let these be your reading problems: 
(1) Compare Mr. Smith’s theme with Mr. Kerfoot’s and with Mr. 
Bennett’s in the preceding selections. See if you can write one sen- 
tence which will cover the themes of three men. 
(2) Look for, note carefully, write out in your own words, and re- 
member the statement Mr. Smith makes about the man who “creates 
universal literature.” 
(3) Notice the striking character of the illustration which compares 
the truth found in the multiplication table with the truth found in a 
poem or essay. The main difference lies in what the two kinds of truth 
do for the reader, what effect they have upon him. 
(4) When Mr. Smith urges us to find in literature an “outlet,” asking 
us to find what it has in common with ourselves, he is stating in another 
form the central idea of this chapter. Be ready to explain how this is 
true. : 
Why is Lincoln’s Gettysburg speech literature, and why is 
Edward Everett’s two-hour speech on the same occasion not 
literature? Let us picture the scene: There were men, women, 
and children in that audience who had lost brothers, sons, hus- 
bands, and fathers on the very ground on which they now 
stood. It was to them a holy place. It did not suggest to their

LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 223 
minds vexed political questions ; it suggested memories that were 
almost too sacred for words. What these people needed was a 
spokesman who should put into fitting words the dumb emotions 
that filled every heart, and this is what Lincoln did. He put 
their emotions into language “plain enough for any boy I know 
to comprehend.” But he did more. He expressed what all of 
us feel when we stand on a spot hallowed by heroic self-sacrifice. 
It may be a battlefield of victory or an equally glorious battle- 
field of defeat; it may be the birthplace or the grave or the 
home of a great man. The important thing for us is to feel 
anew the ennobling, the dedicating, influence of the place itself. 
The man who can put this universal feeling into universal words 
not only creates universal literature, but becomes a universal 
benefactor. 
This is just what Edward Everett did not do. He did not 
speak for the audience, but to them. He entered into a long 
argument as to the relation of the federal government to the 
state governments. “Your argument,” wrote Lincoln, “was new 
to me, and, as I think, is one of the best arguments for the 
national supremacy.” Everett replied, “I should be glad if I 
could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of 
the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.” 
Now what Lincoln did for the Gettysburg audience, the great 
poets and prose writers, the masters of literature, have done for 
mankind at large. A poet is a man who feels as we feel, but 
has the gift of expression. Literature includes all writings that 
express for us what we consciously or unconsciously feel the 
need of saying but cannot. It includes the prose and verse that 
find us at most points, that take our half-formed thoughts, our 
suppressed moods, our stifled desires, and lead them out into 
harmony and completeness. 
It is different with arithmetic or geometry. The multiplica- 
tion table, for example, is as valuable a piece of information as 
was ever compressed into so small a space. But compare it with 
these lines:
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
So nigh is grandeur to our dust, 
So near is God to man, 
When Duty whispers low, “Thou must,” 
The youth replies, “I can!” 
All of us have felt that when we have to do a thing we seem 
to be given a new power with which to do it. Young people 
especially, as Emerson implies in his last line, have had this 
experience. Perhaps one reason is that when we know we must 
perform a certain duty, we stop wasting thought on how to 
escape it and so concentrate all our powers on actually doing it. 
Perhaps also we had never consciously thought of the reason for 
this principle of human nature, but had nevertheless been 
vaguely conscious that the principle was true. At any rate, 
when we read Emerson’s lines we feel that he confirms and 
expands and elevates a mere impression into a definite thought, 
gloriously expressed. He has turned the light on our own 
nature, and we know ourselves better. We begin to realize 
that whenever “I can” follows “You must,” it is an evidence 
not of weakness but of the native nobility of human nature. 
Now the multiplication table is just as true as anything ever 
said by a poet. Perhaps it is truer, but it is true in a different 
way. We do not feel like saying: “Why, this table merely ex- 
pressed what I had already felt or been dimly coming to, but 
expresses it with a beauty and force and completeness that 
give me a new sense of its truth.” No one ever said that of 
the multiplication table and no one ever will. Emerson’s lines, 
in other words, meet you halfway; the multiplication table does 
not. Emerson’s lines are an outlet through which your own 
thought and feeling flow, and deepen as they flow; the multi- 
plication table has to be put into you from the outside........ 
Consider the truth of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner. This 
great poem may seem at a first reading to be a jumble of im- 
possible facts set to haunting music. But it is nothing of the 
sort. It is the story of a man who, by an ‘act of cruelty done 
to a harmless bird, came to feel himself an outcast. He had
-P-A-G-E-225
  LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 225 
eut all the cords of sympathy that bound him to the living 
things about him—to man and bird and beast. He was so mis- 
erable that it was a small matter to him whether he lived or 
died. At last his sympathy with living things came back to 
him because, almost without knowing it, he found himself re- 
joicing in the joy of the water snakes that played around the 
ship. Everything is restored now as it was, and the law of 
love is so burned into his soul that, as long as he lives, he 
must buttonhole others and tell them his experience. 
All the so-called facts in the poem, all the events, bear di- 
rectly on this experience. Did you never have an experience 
like it? Whether you are old or young, did you never kill 
or strike or hurt an innocent thing and feel mean and lonely 
for it? If so, you have lived The Ancient Mariner without 
knowing it. The poem is a part of yourself. Coleridge might 
have written from your experience as well as from an imaginary 
mariner’s. But you have never knowingly or unknowingly 
proved by your own experience that the square of the longest 
side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the squares of the 
other two sides. 
Do not approach literature, then, from the fact-side, but from 
the heart-side. Strike first for what it has in common with 
yourself. See in it an outlet, not an inlet. Unfortunately it is 
still taught—you may be sure not learned—from the fact-side. 
I have before me three editions of The Ancient Mariner. 
They all have long introductions telling the facts about Cole- 
ridge’s life, when and where the poem was written, when and 
where it was added to, what kind of line and stanza the poet 
used, what book or books he probably read before writing the 
poem, but not a word as to what the poem has in it for 
you and me or of you and me. Now the life of a poet, the 
date of his work, the kind of meter employed, all have some- 
thing to do with a poem. But they are secondary, not pri- 
mary. The first thing to do is to find yourself in the poem 
itself. When you do this, when the poem means something to 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
you, when you see in it a reflection or extension of yourself, 
when it becomes a real outlet for you, you will want to know 
something about the writer. Seek first, however, yourself in 
the poem, and all these other things will be added unto you. 
You ean no more learn literature from the history of literature 
than you can learn arithmetic from the history of arithmetic. 
If you could summon before you the makers of literature, 
they would tell you that they found their inspiration not in 
introductions to great books, not in discussions of great books, 
not in learned notes about great books, but in great books 
themselves. They found themselves in these books, for these 
books were a voice from within, not a fact from without. 
Listen to some of the men who have put their experience on

Shakespeare (says Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of 
Kidnapped) has served me best. Few living friends have had 
upon me an influence so strong for good as Hamlet or Rosalind. 
The next book, in order of time, to influence me, was the New 
Testament, and in particular the Gospel According to St. 
Matthew. I believe it would startle and move anyone if he 
could make a certain effort of imagination and read it freshly 
like a book, not droningly and dully like a portion of the Bible. 
You will notice that Stevenson does not refer to a particu- 
lar passage or verse or chapter from the Bible; he refers to a 
whole book. He evidently read the Bible not by fragments, 
but by books. No masterpiece of world literature has suf- 
fered so much by piecemeal reading as the Bible.............. 
Philip Gilbert Hamerton, the well-known writer on art, 
found a lasting delight in the poetry of Walter Scott because 
he and Scott were both lovers of lakes, hills, and streams. 
I began with the poems, and read them so often that I al- 
most knew them by heart before I had read a single page of 
the prose tales. The Lady of the Lake was my especial fa- 
vorite, and I have no doubt that my early enthusiasm for that

delightful poem implanted in me a love for beautiful lakes 
with romantic islands in them which had practical conse- 
quences afterward. Even to this day these feelings are as lively 
in me as ever, so that nothing in the world seems to me so 
completely delightful as a lake if one has a sailing-boat to 
wander over it. Scott, too, had the same love for hills and 
streams that I had imbibed from nature in my youth, and in 
his narratives of adventure he suited my temper so exactly that 
to read him was a complete satisfaction, without any draw- 
back whatever. I am still a reader of Scott, and never appre- 
ciated the qualities of Ivanhoe so completely as on reading that 
masterpiece last year. Of all authors it is Scott who has given 
me the greatest sum of pleasure, and that of a very healthy 
kind. 
Hamerton’s own preferences remind us that it will not do 
to lay down hard and fast rules for reading. The main thing 
is to find the writer or writers, the book or books, that enrich 
your thinking by interpreting it. Sometimes the right book 
startles or warns you, sometimes it takes issue squarely with 
you, sometimes it reveals new powers latent in you, but in 
every case it reveals something in common with you, and on 
this common basis you rise toward its level. One would think 
that if Hamerton loved lakes, streams, and hills, he might have 
found a congenial spirit in the great nature poet, William 
Wordsworth. “But there was something in Wordsworth,” says 
Hamerton, “that I found repellent, perhaps his belief in his own 
moral and intellectual excellence.”” When our own nature poet, 
William Cullen Bryant, first read Wordsworth, he said, “A 
thousand springs seemed to gush up at once into my heart, and 
the face of nature changed of a sudden into a strange fresh- 
ness and life.” He had found a mind greater than his own, 
but thoroughly in sympathy with him. Like had met like. It 
was Lincoln and the Gettysburg audience again............... 
But I like to consider the service that great writers have 
rendered to mankind at large, and not merely to those who 
were to become great writers themselves. The Gettysburg

    228 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
Speech has doubtless helped thousands of orators and would-be 
orators, but it has helped tens of thousands of people who are 
not orators and who have never given expression to their in- 
debtedness by tongue or pen. The greatest service of litera- 
ture has been in behalf, not of professional writers and speakers, 
but of those who feel the need of a spokesman all the more 
keenly because they lack the ability themselves to voice their 
own feelings. Great singers help other singers, but the pleasure 
that they give to those who are themselves unable to sing is 
many times greater than the service rendered to the few pro- 
fessionals. Most of us are songs without words, only the few 
know the words, but all feel the thrill when the words are 
sung. It may be sorrow, or joy, or mere perplexity, or dull 
indifference, but, whatever it is, it craves expression........... 
Literature, then, is within you. The masters only bring 
it out. It is to your soul that they ery “Open Sesame.” When- 
ever you say of a poem or story, “That’s what I have dimly 
felt before—or felt a thousand times before—but could never 
say,” freedom through expression has begun. The masters have 
found you and you have begun to find yourself. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Problems and Projects 
1. Mr. Smith refers to Edward Everett’s long oration which imme- 
diately preceded Lincoln’s short address at the Gettsyburg battlefield. 
Appoint representatives to secure a full account of that occasion and 
report on it to the class. 
2. Many immature readers fail to re-think ideas for themselves; 
they are content merely with absorbing ideas of others. In contrast, 
an energetic student turns ideas over in his mind, weighs them, works 
them over until he succeeds in adding to or subtracting from the 
original ideas as he secures them from the printed page. Someone 
has pointed out that no thought really belongs to a reader until he has 
thus defined it for himself and has fitted it truly into his own experience.

  LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 229 
Select a passage from one of your books of literature and in reading 
it follow the advice of the preceding paragraph. 
3. Study any poem current in your literature class. Analyze the kind 
of mental content the reader has to have to appreciate it. 
4. Why ean you very easily learn to drive a standard gear-shift car, 
if you have previously driven a Dodge? Why is it more difficult if you 
are experienced in driving a Ford? Why, then, is it diffieult for a 
reader who peruses the sporting sheet, exclusively, to read good books? 
5. What is your idea of the difference between “speaking for an audi- 
ence,” and “speaking to them or at them”? Mr. Smith seems to imply 
that a public speaker ought to do the former, preferably. Do you 
agree? Did Lincoln in “The Gettysburg Address” speak to or for his 
immediate audience? 
6. On pages 224-25, Mr. Smith boils down the story of The Ancient 
Mariner to one short paragraph. Try to do the same with one of your 
other English classics, one recently read. Below your paragraph write 
down the processes of reading upon which you depended for the infor- 
mation you used in your abstract. 
7. Have you any experience. with books similar to that of Hamerton 
with Sir Walter Scott’s books? (See page 226.) One of you might 
name as books which have yielded you similar comfort: Lorna Doone, 
John Halifax, Gentleman, or Captains Courageous. What books ean 
you name? Make a list on the board from the suggestions given. 
8. The significance of a fact, when it has entered the mind of an 
individual or a group, and has been transformed into thinking by the 
activities of the hearers’ minds, is well illustrated in a story told by 
John B. Gough. 
A child was persistently disturbing the sleep of the passengers of 
a Pullman car, At last an old miner, completely exasperated, ex- 
claimed : 
“Where is that child’s mother?” 
The father of the child, who had been doing his best to comfort 
the babe, replied, 
“In the baggage car, in a coffin.” 
The information imparted immediately transformed the attitude 
of the passengers; their minds were filled with new thought and 
purpose. The gruff old miner rose from his berth and, relieving the 
tired father, began to walk the floor with the babe. There was not 
another word of complaint during the entire journey.
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
Can you give any data which will tend to show in a similar man- 
ner what an isolated fact can accomplish when it has been transformed 
into thinking and feeling in the hearers’ minds and hearts? 
9. Compare Smith and Bennett on the use of books. Which concep- 
tion do you prefer? Why? Also compare Ruskin (page 193) and 
Smith on the same point. 
10. Mr. Smith seems to think that the business of an author is to 
find a sympathetic response. Is it not part of a writer’s duty to create 
a sympathetic response in his readers? In reply, refer to an intensely 
interesting story you have read or heard. 
11. How does the statement that a poet is stagnating if he is ever 
satisfied with the poetry he writes, apply in your own school life? 
12, Mr. Smith speaks of books forming an “outlet” for us. In what 
sense may they be considered as forming an “inlet”? 
13. In Chapter V of What Can Literature Do for Me? the author 
explains that literature “can show you the glory of the commonplace.” 
Read the chapter thoughtfully, and then write a paragraph or two 
which Mr. Smith might have inserted about Burns, or Whittier, or any 
other poet of your choice. Be sure that your paragraphs are in strict 
keeping with the tone of the chapter. 
Problems for Oral or Written Work 
Read through the following excerpts, each presenting a phase of the 
central theme of this chapter. Select three which seem to you most 
interesting, most appropriate for your thought. Then endeavor to 
restate in simpler form the thought of each chosen excerpt and to sup- 
plement it with illustrations from your own experience as a student or 
as an observer of others. Read aloud in class what you write. 
1. Looking beneath the surface: 
Literature fails to show on the surface all that the reader is expected 
to-see. Much of it states only a very small part of this. Consider the 
following verse; tell what it shows on the surface, and what it really 
means to you: 
The quality of mercy is not strained; 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
Upon the place beneath; it is twice blest; 
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
-P-A-G-E-231
LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 231 
2. Letting the mind play: 
When Shakespeare is giving an account of the various qualities that 
make up man’s excellence, he includes “looking before and after.” 
We let our minds play around all that is submitted to them, and in this 
way get to a truer knowledge. 
3. Setting one’s mind to work: 
For my own part, I value more and more the books that set my mind 
to work. 
4. Getting at the bottom: 
There is no way of getting at the bottom of Shakespeare. 
—H. W. Masiz, Books and Culture, page 9. 
Find a passage and demonstrate this. 
5. Seeing a flat surface when you read: 
Some readers see only a flat surface as they read; others find the book 
a door into a real world, and forget that they are dealing with a book. 
The real readers get beyond a book, into the life it describes. 
—H. W. Masts, Books and Culture, page 47. 
6. Reading like love-making: 
The truth is that the reading of books is like love-making because it 
takes two. It is not enough for the author to give; the reader must 
know how to take, and not only how to take, but how to give in return. 
—F. Tennyson Jesse, The Bookman, Vol. 47, page 314. 
7. What significance, if any, has this distinction of Wordsworth for 
a reader? 
Wordsworth, the poet, protested against calling language or diction 
the dress of our thoughts . . . He said, “Language is the incarnation 
of our thoughts.” 
—A. Quiuier-Coucn, On the Art of Reading, pages 227-28. 
8. How can a bad reader make a bad book? 
My point is that a thoroughly bad reader does make what he is pleased 
to call a thoroughly bad book. We all admit that there are plenty of 
bad books, but who has given due thought to the bad readers? 
—F. Tennyson Jesse, The Bookman, Vol. 49, page 316. 
9. Cramming vs. ruminating: 
Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is 
thinking that makes over what we read. We are of the ruminating 
kind, and it is not enough to cram ourselves with a great load of col- 
lections; unless we chew them over again, they will not give us strength 
and nourishment. 
—J. W. Batpwin, The Book Lover, page 44.
-P-A-G-E-232
  232 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
10. Digesting : 
“Much reading,” says Dr. Robert South, “is like much eating—wholly 
useless without digesting.” 
—J. W. Batpwin, The Book Lover, page 44. 
11. Coleridge’s classification of readers: 
He said that some readers are like jelly-bags—they let pass away all 
that is pure and good, and retain only what is refuse. Another class he 
typified by a sponge; these are they whose minds suck all up, and give 
it back again only a little dirtier. Others, again, he likened to an hour- 
glass, and their reading to the sand that runs in and out, and leaves 
no trace behind. And still others he compared to the worker in mines 
who retains the gold or the gem, and casts aside the dust and the dross. 
—J. W. Baupwin, The Book Lover, pages 54-55. 
12. Surpassing the bare statements of a book: 
It is not alone in literature proper that an intelligent reader is 
required to supplement the bare thought of a text. Suppose he is read- 
ing an article about a great reclamation project by which an arid 
desert has been transformed into productive land. The real student 
must surpass the bare statements of the printed page, and in his mind’s 
eye reconstruct the contrast between the arid waste of sand, and the 
blooming fields of grain. To aid in this respect, textbooks often accom- 
pany expositions of the sort just suggested by pictures, in the hope that 
all readers, and especially the dull, inexperienced, or lazy readers may 
be assisted in doing the necessary work. But oftentimes such visual 
aids are not present. One major difference between mediocrity and 
expertness in reading lies largely in the absence or the presence of the 
reader’s constructive imagination, by which the words of a text are in 
the reader’s mind illuminated into vivid realities, the reader making the 
pictures for himself. Think of a situation in which you have read 
expertly in the sense named. 
Alternative: Have you ever felt irritated because of poorly drawn 
illustrations or wretched pictures, or other inadequate visual aids in a 
book? Have you ever preferred to create your own mental picture of 
a character rather than look at the one in a book? If so, tell the class 
about your experience. 
13. Under your teacher’s guidance, plan and carry through a class 
exercise, in which, using a selection from your literature class, you try 
to make at least one marginal entry corresponding to each of the five 
steps named by Hall-Quest on pages 195-96. 
14. Two quotations are here given from John Ruskin, the meaning of 
which may seem to be in direct opposition to much of the advice given 
in the present chapter. Ruskin says:
-P-A-G-E-233
     LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 233 
Very ready are we to say of a book, “How good this is—that’s exactly 
what I think!” But the right feeling is “How strange that is! I never 
thought of that before, and yet I see that it is true; or if I do not 
now, I hope I shall some day.” But whether thus submissively or not, 
at least be sure that you go to an author to get his meaning, not to find 
yours. 
In another place, Ruskin speaks of “annihilating our own personality 
in reading,” and “seeking to enter” into the author’s. 
You will begin to perceive that what you thought was a matter of no 
serious importance. Most probably you will have no legitimate right to 
an “opinion” on any business, except that instantly under your hand. 
Do you think that a reader should be submissive, and regard his own 
thought “of no serious consequence,” “annihilating his own personality 
in reading’? Explain. Do you see any way of reconciling Ruskin’s 
views as here expressed with the central theme of this chapter? 
15. Motten says, “The poem, the expressed word, is only the envelope, 
and we must open the envelope to get the message.” Exemplify this 
with a poem found in a magazine of the year and month in which you 
are working. What is the message in the envelope? 
Poetry in the High School, page 45. 
16. Read again President Bryan’s article on Memory, Chapter Four 
(page 182), to see how he applies the major principle of the present 
chapter to the “getting” process upon which good memory depends. 
17. Charles F. Richardson also dwells upon the central idea of this 
chapter: 
The great secret of reading consists in this—that it does not matter 
so much what we read or how we read it as what we think and how we 
think it. Reading is only the fuel; and, the mind once on fire, any 
and all material will feed the flame, provided only it have any com- 
bustible matter in it. 
18. Though a man reads undisputed classics for twenty-four hours 
a day, though he has a memory of steel, though he rivals Porson in 
scholarship and Saint-Beuve in judgment, he is not receiving from 
literature what literature has to give. Unless he can read differently, 
it were better for him if he sold all his books, gave to the poor, and 
played croquet. Genius has offered him faith, courage, vision, noble 
passion, curiosity, love, a thirst for beauty; and he has not taken the 
gift—ArnoLp BENNETT. 
19. The great poems of the world, the great books of the world, are 
written in invisible ink. It is your own personality that brings out 
the writing —ANONYMOUS.

  234 READING AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS 
20. He reads a book most wisely who thinks everything into a book 
that it is capable of holding, and it is the stamp and token of a great 
book so to incorporate itself with our own being, so to quicken our in- 
sight and stimulate our thought, as to make us feel that we helped to 
create it while we read—Jamus RusseLL LoweLL. 
21. Kerfoot considers reading in the light of an investigation in 
which the reader experiments both with the book and with himself. A 
reader subdivides, distributes, and reassembles both the contents of the 
book and his own experience. In short, with the book serving as a 
guide, the reader is sent forth on a tour of investigation, and then is 
called back to make reports of his journeys. Deliberately plan to ex- 
plore in this sense one of your assigned books in any school task. Be 
ready to speak of your exploration. 
(a) Do you subdivide merely by chapters? 
(b) Do you distribute some of your own contributing experiences? 
If so, what? 
(ce) Do you reassemble at various stages, and at the end, both the 
content of the book and your own experiences? 
22. Another statement of Kerfoot’s conception is that the reader is 
a “maker,” whose materials are not sound, color, words, but his own 
accumulated experience. Everything he creates in reading corresponds 
to some actual happening of his own, or some possible happening. A 
reader never really grasps the contents of a book of autobiography, 
for instance, until he has read and reread into it the many possible 
selves that life has denied him the chance to be. 
Does this give an explanation of. our liking for books of wholesome 
aceomplishment, of difficulties overcome and ultimate success? Does it 
explain also our distaste for unpleasant endings? The story goes that 
Kipling wrote an unhappy ending for The Light That Failed. Urged 
by his publishers, he rewrote the ending, making all come out happily. 
Later, Mr. Kipling canceled the happy ending. Some of you may care 
to read that novel, consider the unpopular ending, and express an 
opinion as to whether the happy ending is a logical one for the tale. 
23. Explain your enjoyment of a favorite novel in the light of your 
own contributions to it. 
24. Find ten passages in Silas Marner, or some other novel you know, 
in which the writer suggests to an alert-minded reader far more than 
she says. For example, from Silas Marner:
-P-A-G-E-235
      LITERATURE CAN GIVE YOU AN OUTLET 235 
“The handsome brown spaniel that lay on the hearth retreated under 
the chair in the chimney corner when Dunsey entered the room.” 
Another good example occurs in Macbeth, when Macduff is told about 
the murder of his wife and children. Says one of his friends: 
“What, man! Ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.” 
25. Read again Ruskin’s paragraphs on pages 193-94. Is there any 
way of reconciling his idea of hidden meaning with the statement 
that great truths are often stated very simply?

7. Read again Ruskin’s figure on gold (page 194). Make a rough 
analogy of a mind finding the heart of a writer’s thought, as compared 
with the smelting process by which the gold is extracted from the ore.

And thought, “Had I a sword of keener steel—

SECTION I 
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION 
In earlier chapters we have seen that a careful student reads 
with a purpose, grasps the author’s main thought and subordinate 
divisions, remembers and is able to reproduce that thought, and 
supplements it both by raising sensible inquiries and by supply- 
ing data out of his own mental stock. In these chapters we have 
occasionally hinted at another skill by which a careful reader 
learns to be judicial in his reading, sometimes critical, and 
occasionally even skeptical about the substance of what he reads, 
and of the conclusions he is asked to draw from it. In the pres- 
ent chapter this skill is called “Evaluating What We Read.” 
A few examples of uncritical thinking may emphasize the 
need of standards of judgment. First we are faced by the fact 
that the very large majority of us are born into our political 
beliefs. No one can estimate how many members of political 
parties today owe their political faith not to any reasoned re- 
flection of their own concerning issues, but to heredity. It is 
unusual to find a Democratic voter who is a member of a Repub- 
239
-P-A-G-E-240
  240 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
liean family, and vice versa. Again, it is affirmed, with at least 
some foundation, that political campaigns are decided by at- 
tractive slogans which catch the ear and tickle the fancy of 
multitudes of voters. The suggestive campaign motto “The full 
dinner pail” is said to have won more votes for protective tariff 
than a thousand campaign speeches setting forth economic 
theory and bristling with facts and figures. Such slogans sum 
up the ardent desires of the masses; people blindly believe the 
implied promises and think that they may be realized. They 
vote merely on an unreasoning hope! 
Another more amusing, even if less important, example of loose 
thinking is the readiness of many people to believe patent- 
medicine advertisements. Literally millions of dollars worth of 
such advertisements appear every year. The story is told that 
an energetic advertising firm, desiring to prove that skillful 
advertising will sell any product, made a certain harmless but 
valueless mixture, put it up in attractive bottles, and advertised 
it widely. After a year or two the worthless stuff was selling at 
a neat profit. Then the company, having demonstrated that 
advertising will sell anything, withdrew the “discovery” from 
the market. For quack remedies our people spend $800,000,000 
annually, consuming more drugs than any other nation of 
similar size on earth, in spite of the fact that medical experts 
say that such remedies have little real value. 
The need for careful evaluation is emphasized also by the ease 
with which misleading tales make their way into the newspapers. 
This is well exemplified by data reported in The Outlook. 
The following story has appeared in several papers: “Shortly 
before going abroad last year Sinclair Lewis bought a fancy suit- 
ease for his wife. They used it on a week-end trip up the Hudson 
* and it was stolen on the train. In it was the manuscript of 
Lewis’s new novel. The real tragedy is that Mr. Lewis did not 
have a carbon copy.” 
Messrs. Harcourt, Brace & Co., Mr. Lewis’s publishers, say 
regarding this story: ‘Aside from the facts that the stolen suit- 
case was not one but two, that they were not stolen on a train up 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION 241 
the Hudson, U.S. A., but at a station in London, that in neither 
of them was there a single word of manuscript, notes, or any 
other literary material, that Mr. Lewis always keeps a carbon 
copy of everything he writes, and that, finally, when the suit- 
cases were'stolen he had completed only a small part of the new 
novel, the story, is a triumph of correct details." 
In order to evaluate what he reads, a careful thinker needs to 
consider three matters: (1) he needs to estimate his own fair- 
mindedness; (2) he needs to estimate the reliability of the 
writer; and (3) he needs to estimate the value of the facts and 
the conclusions which he is asked to believe. Even more than a 
reader, a listener ought to be carefully on his guard. A listener, 
especially if he is carried away by a speaker’s personal force or 
charm, is likely to neglect to analyze the value and credibility of 
the speaker’s message. 
(1) Test your own fair-mindedness. 
(a) Is your own mind free from personal prejudice? Many 
people are misled because they never seriously take themselves 
to task; they never examine frankly and make allowance for the 
bias that is given their judgments by their own desires and preju- 
dices. They see, read, and hear everything through glasses col- 
ored by their own interests or affiliations. Prejudice means liter- 
ally pre-judging. Thus a citizen who is positive that he is 
overburdened by taxes may always be unreservedly hostile to 
any new public improvements; a blind partisan always approves 
the candidates and policies of his party regardless of their mer- 
its. Obviously, a “closed mind,” that is, one which invariably 
applies ready-made but unreasoned judgments to every new 
issue, is a menace to itself and to society, 
Ruskin, cautioning readers to be on guard against these and 
related weaknesses of their own, gives this pertinent advice: 
A little honest study will enable you to perceive that what you 
1The Outlook, Vol. 132, page 619.
-P-A-G-E-242
249 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
drifted, helpless, entangled weeds of castaway thought; nay, you 
will see that most men’s minds are little better than rough wilder- 
ness, neglected and stubborn, partly barren, partly overgrown 
with pestilent brakes and venomous wind-sown herbage of evil 
surmise; that the first thing you have to do for yourself is 
eagerly and scornfully to set fire to this; burn all the jungle 
into wholesome ash-heaps, and then plow and sow. 
(6) Are you able to give a fair hearing to people who differ 
with you? Obviously, it is easy to accept the statements of those 
who agree with our own general beliefs and principles; and it is 
hard to realize that in most questions the entire right may not be 
on our side. To make allowances for reasonable differences in 
belief and action, to be willing and able to estimate our own 
eause in the light of opinions which differ from ours is always 
the mark of fair-minded men or women. 
Isaae Watts has this in mind when he says: 
Unhappy they that hunt ana purvey for a party, and scrape 
together all those things, and those only who favor their own 
tenets, while they despise and neglect all the rest! The chief 
cautions that I design are these three: 
i. We should read with a just freedom of thought all those 
books which treat of such subjects as may admit of doubt and 
reasonable dispute. Nor should any of our opinions be so 
resolved upon, especially in younger years, as never to hear or 
to bear an opposition to them, 
ii. When we peruse those authors who defend our own settled 
sentiments, we should not take all their arguments for just and 
solid; but we should make a wise distinction between the corn 
and the chaff, between solid reasoning and the mere superficial 
colors of it; nor should we readily swallow down all their lesser 
opinions because we agree with them in the greater. 
iii. When we read those authors who oppose our most cer- 
tain and established principlesy we should be ready to receive 
any information from them in other points, and not abandon at 
once everything they say, though we remain well fixed in our 
opposition to their main point of arguing.
-P-A-G-E-243
  
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION 243 
(2) Test the writer’s or speaker’s reliability. 
When sure of your own fair-mindedness, test the writer’s or 
speaker’s reliability by asking questions about him: 
(a) What is known about his honesty ? What is his reputation ? 
What is his purpose in writing or speaking? Would he observe 
and report fairly all facts that might conflict with his own inter- 
est? What has he himself to gain or lose by the decision upon 
the issues raised? These are fair questions to ask concerning the 
writers of all articles in the public press, whether signed or 
unsigned. 
The fact is that people do most of their writing and speaking 
for enterprises in the success of which they personally have an 
interest. This is perfectly proper; but the trustworthiness of 
their arguments may be questioned just in proportion to their 
honest willingness to see and report facts which are not fully 
in accord with their beliefs. 
The extent of caution that should be exercised in applying this 
test is indicated by the weight which is generally attached to 
hurtful testimony. If a witness testifies to a fact which is clearly 
and unmistakably against his own persona! or family or business 
or party interest, which harms his own cause, he is making what 
is called a “hurtful” admission. Such hurtful admissions are 
usually considered reliable evidence. If this is true, caution 
should be used in the case of “helpful” statements. 
(b) What experience has the author had in the subject about 
which he speaks? Is he a recognized authority? Is he dealing 
with a set of conditions familiar to him? Or is he speaking about 
matters to which he has recently been a stranger? Here we face 
a very common danger in the public press. Unfortunately, men 
whose names have unquestioned weight in their own specialties 
frequently express opinions and make criticisms in matters quite 
foreign to their own lines of expertness. The public, recognizing 
such men as authorities in their own specialties, is likely to give
-P-A-G-E-244
  
244 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
undue weight to their opinions in fields about which they know 
very little. An Edison in science, a Burbank in hortieulture— 
such men’s statements may be accepted as final in the fields to 
which they have devoted a lifetime; but these very men them- 
selves would hardly claim to be experts in city government, 
polities, or religion. 
(c) How authoritative are the sources of information upon 
which the writer or speaker has relied? Everyone knows how 
gossip spreads from mouth to mouth, growing a little stronger 
with each new repetition, until a tale reaches proportions that 
may do great harm. Obviously, “With what definite information 
did that story begin?” is always a pertinent question; and in 
matters more important than personal rumor, the same principle 
of caution applies. In scientific fields, direct observation and 
data recorded from reliable experimentation are always necessary 
for final accuracy. In historical subjects, “original documents” 
are demanded. Hearsay, guessing, conjecture, mere assertion, 
are always thrown out of court. 
(3) Test the credibility of the statements themselves. 
Very often the statements themselves contain internal evidence 
that may throw some light upon the credibility of the matter in 
hand. 
(a) Are the statements presented quietly, moderately, and in 
1 dignified manner? There is often a close connection between 
the way in which ideas are presented and the reliability of the 
ideas themselves. A quiet, dignified, straightforward, frank state- 
ment of fact or opinion carries a presumption of reliability. On 
the contrary, a loud, flowery statement, expressed in high-sound- 
ing phrases and garish terms, carries with it a presumption of 
unreliability. Most of the great truths of life are capable of 
being stated simply and without adornment. 
(b) Do the statements agree with other established facts and 
conclusions? The outstanding example of the use of this test is
-P-A-G-E-245
  STANDARDS OF EVALUATION 245 
found in an alibi. If there is some fact, true beyond all doubt, 
which is quite inconsistent with certain other facts or conclusions 
which you are asked to believe, great doubt is thrown upon the 
latter. A man cannot have been guilty of a physical act in 
California, if, at the known time of that act, he was in New 
York. The charge is inconsistent with known facts. If you 
hear commended as great literature a poem written by someone 
whose other poems you know to be quite mediocre, your common 
sense makes you hesitate to believe the commendation. The 
alleged fact is quite inconsistent with other specific facts which 
are known to you. 
(c) Are the statements in accord with the knowledge of ordi- 
nary human experience? After all, our own general acquaint- 
ance with everyday life, based upon such contact as we have had 
with human experience, may be the best safeguard for our think- 
ing. Do we read or hear that a candidate for high office is a 
drunkard, a defrauder, a wife-beater? Do we come upon some 
other serious charge against him? If so, even if he is not the 
candidate of our own personal choice, we must hesitate to accept 
extravagant criticism lodged against him, We must be thus 
skeptical, because it is not in accord with everyday experience 
that a man should rise to the candidacy for a high office if he 
is himself a degenerate.

HABITUAL ACCURACY IN OBSERVATION AND 
STATEMENT?! 
CxHaries W. Enior 
Reading Suggestions 
1. Read the severe indictment made by Dr. Charles W. Eliot against 
the loose thinking which he says characterized the American people 
during the World War. The war time was especially appropriate for 
misleading propaganda. 
2. Supply from your own experience some concrete data for each of 
the directions and questions printed in italies. 
Since the United States entered actively into the war there has 
been an extraordinary exhibition of the incapacity of the Amer- 
ican people as a whole to judge evidence, to determine facts, and 
even to discriminate between facts and fancies. This incapacity 
appears in the public press, in the prophecies of prominent ad- 
ministrative officials, both state and national, in the exhorta- 
tions of the numerous commissions which are undertaking to 
guide American business and philanthropy, and in the almost 
universal acceptance by the people at large, day by day, of state- 
ments which have no foundation, and of arguments the premises 
of which are not facts or events, but only hopes and guesses. 
PROBLEM.      Report a statement that had no foundation. 
It is a matter of everyday experience that most Americans 
cannot observe with accuracy, repeat correctly a conversation,

Education.”

describe accurately what they have themselves seen or heard, or 
write out on the spot a correct account of a transaction they 
have just witnessed. These incapacities are exhibited just as 
much by highly educated Americans as they are by the unedu- 
cated, especially if the defects of their education have not been 
remedied in part by their professional experience. 
ProsueM. Give a case of one of the weaknesses named. 
The physician, the surgeon, and the public health officer often 
escape these defects because their whole professional training 
and experience develop in them keen powers of observation and 
reasoning—powers which must be generally accurate and trust- 
worthy if professional suecess has been attained. 
Some men whose education ceased at fourteen acquire through 
experience in their trade powers of observation and correct infer- 
ence which professional men whose education was continued to 
their twenty-fifth year never acquire. It is the men who have 
learned, probably out of school, to see and hear correctly and to 
reason cautiously from facts observed, who carry on the great 
industries of the country and make possible great transportation 
systems and international commerce. 
Propuem. Why must a surgeon be accurate in his thinking? 
Eight years ago Mr. George G. Crocker, a lawyer, who had 
been for several years Chairman of the Boston Rapid Transit 
Commission, and in that capacity had been much interested in 
the lawsuits which grew out of accidents in the tunnels under 
construction, contrived an instructive experiment on the accu- 
racy of the testimony of bystanders. He invited twenty highly 
educated gentlemen, all of whom had been successful in their 
several callings, to witness a brief scene enacted close to them 
by four actors in about one minute, and to write out immediately, 
each for himself, a description of what he had seen and heard. 
Three of the twenty witnesses did not attempt to write out what 
they had just seen and heard at close quarters. Of the other 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  HABITUAL ACCURACY 249 
seventeen no two agreed as to what happened before them, and 
no one gave a description which was even approximately correct. 
The group contained one judge, one civil engineer, four business 
men (active), three business men (retired), and eleven lawyers. 
Whoever will try a few analogous experiments on groups of his 
acquaintances will soon learn to distrust all tales which have 
passed from probably inaccurate mouth to inaccurate ear and on 
through a series of incompetent transmitters. 
ProsiEM. Be ready to submit plans for a similar experi- 
ment in your class. 
The remedies for the evils described have already been worked 
out in a few schools and in the elective courses of some colleges 
and universities. It remains to apply these remedies universally 
in all the schools of the United States. These remedies are the 
substitution of teaching by observation and experiment for much 
of the book work now almost exclusively relied on; the cultivation 
in the pupils of activity of body and mind during all schooltime 
—an activity which finds delight in the exercise of the senses and 
of the powers of expression in speech and writing; the insistence 
on the acquisition of personal skill of some sort; the stimulation 
in every pupil of interest in his work by making the object of it 
intelligible to him, whether that object be material or spiritual; 
the inspiration in every child of tastes and sensibilities which he 
can use to promote actually his present enjoyment and therefore 
in all probability his future happiness; and finally, the persistent 
teaching of every pupil how facts are got at in common life, how 
to make an accurate record of observed facts, and how to draw 
safe inferences from well-recorded facts. Every boy and girl in 
school should learn by experience how hard it is to repeat aceu- 
rately one short sentence just listened to, to describe correctly the 
colors on a bird, the shape of a leaf, or the design on a nickel. 
Every child should have had during its school life innumerable 
lessons in mental truth-seeking and truth-telling. As things now 
are, comparatively few children have any direct lessons in either 
process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
ProsueMs. Name the activities of your school which accom- 
plish these results. 
What outstanding lesson in this course do you think most 
valuable in this respect? 
It is for the colleges and universities of the country to lead 
the way in working out these serious changes in the prevailing 
methods of American elementary and secondary schools. It will 
not be possible to bring them to pass immediately in American 
public schools, because it will be found necessary to provide on 
a large scale a new sort of teacher for the free schools, and much 
new apparatus. There will doubtless be found some teachers 
already in service who will gladly promote the adoption of the 
new methods. Finally, the successful adoption of the new 
methods will not involve the exclusion of book work, the ceasing 
to cultivate literary and artistic taste, or the reduction of the 
teaching of history, biography, and the fine arts. 
ProsueM. Does this course fall in line with Dr. Eliot’s 
suggestions? 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
1. Diseuss your answers written in response to the problems and 
questions. By class discussion, select the best reply in each case. 
2. Choose the most promising suggestion made in response to the 
fifth problem. Put it in the hands of a committee, the suggester acting 
as chairman, for a trial at some later date. Have the committee invite 
your principal, or some other school officer, to be present on that 
occasion. 
3. Another experiment to test ability is to write out on the spot a 
correct account of a happening you have just witnessed. Have three or 
four of the boys carefully plan a very brief imaginary scene after 2 
game in which their athletic team has been defeated, one boy to be 
charged with the loss of the game. Some other scene of a similar nature 
may be chosen. Let the action and dialogue be very definitely planned, 
written out, memorized, and practiced beforehand. After the scene 
has been presented in class, the rest of the class may attempt to write 
out exactly what was said and done.

SECTION III 
PITFALLS IN THINKING, PART I 
Reading suggestions 
1. Named and illustrated in this and the following discussion are 
eight errors in thinking frequently made by ignorant or careless peo- 
ple. If you can recognize these errors when you read or hear them, 
you will avoid a considerable portion of the mistakes which characterize 
the reasoning of many people. 
2. Study this discussion with the firm resolve to understand each 
error here named. Try to fix it in mind by closing your book after 
each of the divisions and by repeating aloud one of the conerete 
examples cited. Then, speaking very distinctly, pronounce aloud the 
name of the fallacy illustrated; try to add one example of your own. 
THE NEED OF CARE IN READING 
This discussion attempts to set forth, by means of simple illus- 
trations, four of the most common mistakes in reasoning. It re- 
duces to lowest terms some of the twists of thought which lead 
from sound evidence to false conclusions, and presents definite 
tests which will assist in detecting the errors. 
Little discussion is needed to show the immense value of being 
able to recognize errors in thinking. Such ability means that a 
reader or listener can be constantly on his guard, refusing to 
accept the conclusions of writers and speakers whose arguments 
are faulty. A large share of our information comes to us second- 
hand. As individuals we are able to have personal contact with 
251 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
a comparatively small part of life. For knowledge of the great 
busy world about us we must depend upon the observations of 
other men and women, upon their reasoning powers, and upon 
their ability to report accurately and without prejudice their 
observations and conclusions. 
Dependent as we are upon others for information, we need to 
temember also how likely everyone is to fall into error. Two 
honorable men, each desiring to tell “the truth, the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth,” may quite frequently give almost 
exactly opposite accounts of happenings of which they have been 
eyewitnesses. Moreover, many honest people “see things not 
with their eyes, but with their prejudices”; and unfortunately, 
not all men are scrupulously upright. Against the reports of 
such men we must constantly be on our guard. 
Moreover, people differ radically in drawing conclusions from 
the same facts. How often we find rivals drawing from the same 
statistics directly opposing conclusions. There is a misleading 
saying that “figures will lie.” Figures themselves cannot lie; 
but by the mistake or by the intent of the one using them, fig- 
ures can easily be twisted out of their true meaning. Men’s 
inferences from figures sometimes falsify. Thus, in this old say- 
ing, “Figures will lie,” we attribute to the facts a tendency to 
error which really belongs to the faulty inference-drawing pow- 
ers of men and women. Someone has facetiously remarked that 
figures won’t lie, but liars will figure. 
And it is not only in helping us to guard against the erroneous 
thinking of others that this discussion may be of assistance. 
Every day each one of us is reporting observations that he him- 
self has made, arguing from evidence that he has accumulated, 
trying to convince and persuade others of the wisdom of certain 
lines of action. Obviously, if one wishes to be a trustworthy 
leader, he needs to know how to guard his own writing and 
speaking against errors in thinking. 
Four very common fallacies, the dangers of which are pre- 
sented in this section are: 
   
-P-A-G-E-253
  PITFALLS IN THINKING 253 
(A) Thinking by false analogy. 
(B) Thinking by hasty generalizations. 
(C) Thinking by incorrect causal relationship. 
(D) Thinking through ambiguous terms. 
(A) The Danger of False Analogy 
Abraham Lincoln, urged by his political advisers to change 
some of his policies in the midst of a campaign, denied their 
request, saying, “Gentlemen, I don’t believe in swapping horses 
while crossing a stream.” He was expressing his thought by 
analogy. A few years ago there was in the air a ‘phrase, “You 
can’t unseramble eggs,” used to indicate that many small con- 
cerns cannot be separated after they are once combined in a 
trust. This also is an analogy. 
Such examples suggest both the strength and the weakness of 
this form of thinking called analogy, or resemblance. The 
strength lies in the fact that the meaning of an argument is 
made clear by definite, homely figures of speech. The serambling 
of eggs, the inconvenience of trading horses when fording a 
river, are such everyday affairs, or at least their meaning is so 
clear, that everyone can understand them. The chief value of an 
analogy is to make the speaker’s meaning unmistakable. 
Useful as analogy is in making the meaning vivid, it is never- 
theless a dangerous form of thinking. While there may seem 
to be similarity between the two things compared, the resem- 
blance may not be at all close or exact. The catch phrase, “You 
ean’t unscramble eggs,” is really no proof that trusts cannot be 
dissolved. When one examines closely the process of scrambling 
eggs he finds that in the resulting mixture the constituent parts 
of the eggs have all been changed chemically and inextricably 
mingled together. On the contrary, even after a combination is 
made, the parts in a trust remain physically separate; the 
scrambling in this case is merely in the form of a legal merger. 
The various lines in a railway trust are physically as separate 
after the scrambling process as they were before it. The danger
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
is that because anyone is certain that eggs cannot be unscrambled, 
he will carelessly carry over into an entirely different realm an 
inference which by no means is equally certain. 
This is true of other familiar examples of reasoning by an- 
alogy. Before adopting the vigorous exercise that has made our 
friend well, we need to know to what extent our malady is like 
his, and whether we have the same leisure, the same equipment, 
the same motives for exercise. In other words, both his illness 
and his treatment must very closely resemble ours to make our 
logic probable. Mr. Wanamaker possessed something more than 
poverty; he had something inside him that helped him get his 
start. Mere similarity to him in poverty is no sign that we shall 
get on. We must have the rest of his equipment, or at least the 
essential parts of it. To liken education to the unfolding of a 
flower is all very well. When you come to examine the analogy 
closely, you must remember that lilies in unfolding “toil not, 
neither do they spin.” But this is no indication that a student 
will develop in school if he neither toils nor spins. To test an 
analogy, then, beware of figures of speech. They make the mean- 
ing clear and if properly chosen are of great value in this one 
respect; but they do not prove. Always ask: Are the two 
units compared alike in all points that are essential to the 
comparison? 
(B) The danger of hasty generalizations 
A generalization is the process of thinking through which one 
reaches a general conclusion by examining a number of particu- 
lar instances. For example, after studying the batting percent- 
ages of a large number of league outfielders, you arrive at the 
general conclusion, “Outfielders in a major league are strong 
batters.” By a similar process you reach the conclusion that 
pitchers, as a rule, are poor batters. Again, such old proverbs 
as “Honesty is the best policy,” “The early bird catches the 
worm,” “Early to bed and early to rise makes one healthy, 
wealthy, and wise,” are figurative statements of common truths, 
usually accepted as reliable because hundreds of examples can
-P-A-G-E-255
PITFALLS IN THINKING 255 
be brought forward to prove them. Many accepted principles 
of human belief, of conduct, or of action—the so-called “axioms” 
of life—are in reality based on this process of thinking called 
generalization. 
This common form of reasoning needs to be guarded carefully, 
because it is almost impossible to reach a perfect generalization, 
that is, one based on all the possible examples. About the only 
absolutely perfect generalization of wide scope outside the field 
of the exact sciences is the statement “All men are mortal.” We 
can rest reasonably sure that this is unquestionable; human 
experience does not record one person who has not proved this 
truth sooner or later. If perfect generalizations are unusual, 
we can test the accuracy of imperfect ones by asking two ques- 
tions: 
(1) How many instances have been observed and cited? Sup- 
pose we desire to test the statement, “Office boys are likely to 
rise high.” This has an appealing sound. We hope that it is 
true; and we know that to start as an office boy certainly does 
not prevent success. Everyone can cite the instances of Mr. 
Wanamaker, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Ford, and of someone 
nearer home. Now pin the statement down by the question: 
How many instances have been observed? You will find that of 
all the men who started in business very humbly, you really 
know only a very few who have risen high. Of course, the fact 
that you know very few does not disprove the generalization, but 
it ought to make you hesitate to accept the conclusion without 
reservation. You need to consider the relative size of the unob- 
served class. The first test of a generalization is, then: What is 
the number of instances examined? How many of the possible 
cases have been observed ? 
(2) Are the instances cited fair and typical? This is the sec- 
ond test to be applied. A few years ago a certain daily published 
each fall a list of players hurt in football, and reached the con- 
clusion that the game is brutal and dangerous sport. One year 
the number of fatalities ran unusually high. But upon investiga-
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
tion it was found that almost all the men in one particular squad 
were included in the list of fatalities. On the way to a game, 
the train in which they were riding was wrecked, and many of 
the players were killed. To include those men in the list and 
to attribute their fatalities to football was obviously an unfair 
use of untypical examples. 
In thus recognizing the danger of making generalizations, we 
are by no means to conclude that they are to be avoided or aban- 
doned. In fact, many of our judgments are rightly based upon 
reasoning of this order. A well-known automobile company 
advertises very effectively, “Ask the man who owns one.” Rep- 
utable schools and colleges rely upon the fact that education 
means fitness to take a place of high usefulness in life, and to 
that end point to the records of their graduates. Thoroughly 
reliable investment bankers cite fifty years of activity without 
the loss of a dollar to any investor. Similarly, in innumerable 
ways, legitimate arguments from example are advanced, the 
conclusions from which are generalizations which possess a high 
degree of reliability. The point in hand is merely a caution to 
the careful thinker; in every important issue let him apply the 
two tests: How many cases have been observed and cited; are 
the instances so reported fair and typical cases? 
(C) The danger of incorrect causal relationship 
Another common form of argument is based on causal rela- 
tionship. If you see smoke arising in the distance, you know 
that it is the effect of a familiar cause. You reason from the 
smoke, the effect which you see, back to a known cause, the fire 
which you do not see. Conversely, if a fire is neglected in a dry 
forest, the result may readily be predicted. In the latter case, 
having the cause, which you recognize and understand, you rea- 
son forward to the effect. 
If a man sees a rapidly moving funnel-shaped cloud twisting 
and turning on itself, he thinks: There is a eyclone cloud; and 
in his imagination he can see houses and barns and fields laid
-P-A-G-E-257
  
PITFALLS IN THINKING 257 
waste. Conversely, if in passing a countryside, he sees signs of 
huvoc—trees uprooted, animals killed, and crops destroyed—he 
reasons from these effects back to a known cause—a cyclone cloud. 
These examples show that the argument based on causal 
relationship involves the thinker’s previous experiences. He 
establishes this form of reasoning by observing the relationships 
between causes and results. He learns to predict causes and 
results in terms of the observations he has made. 
Reasoning by causal relationship is common in political con- 
troversies. Who has not heard parties accuse the other of being 
the cause of hard times? It is amusing to recall the opposing 
arguments about the responsibility for a panic. The Republi- 
cans attributed the panic of 1893 to the election of Cleveland; 
and the Democrats insisted that responsibility lay with the four 
years of Republican rule which immediately preceded Cleve- 
land’s term. In all probability neither position was sound. Hard 
times come, not from any single cause—certainly not from a 
change of political administration—but from a large variety of 
contributing causes. Some economists suggest that periods of 
business depression come periodically as the result of the natural 
accumulation of business errors, or from a lack of public con- 
fidence, or from crop failures, or from overspeculation, or from 
extravagant living, or from other causes. The point is that any 
large result like a financial panic, which is in all likelihood the 
product of many causes, ought not to be attributed carelessly to 
a single cause, although that single cause may have contributed 
to the result. 
In this class of errors fall many patent-medicine advertise- 
ments; for example, the “before-and-after-taking” pictures of 
hair-restorers, of consumption cures, of fat-reducers, of youth- 
renewers, and the like. Suppose that Mrs. X. consents to show 
photographs when she weighed 300 pounds, and again when she 
weighed 225. Between the dates of these likenesses she has con- 
sumed twelve large bottles of weight-reducer. During this inter- 
val, perhaps a year has elapsed. All sorts of causes may have 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  258 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
been at work to reduce her weight. She may have been taking 
more vigorous exercise, she may have been eating more suitable 
food, or less of it, she may have been under peculiar mental con- 
ditions affecting her physique. Now, any or all of these causes 
may have assisted the patent medicine in the reduction of 75 
pounds. Indeed the loss of weight might have occurred in spite 
of the medicine rather than because of it. 
Consider the argument, ‘“‘College education makes men suc- 
cessful.” This is often supported by imposing figures from 
Who's Who in America, the book containing the names of the 
most prominent Americans. Now, the general statement may be 
true that a large number of prominent successful people today 
are college graduates. It is true. But the inference that they 
are successful solely because of their college education needs to 
be scrutinized carefully. Granting that a college education prob- 
ably helps one to become successful, there are other conditions 
that are even more essential than education by books. A man 
must have the chance to succeed ; he must have the native ability ; 
he needs a certain amount of health, of good fortune in general. 
These and many other causes or conditions must be present in 
most cases of success. Indeed, one is inclined to believe that 
sound thinking will often attribute both college education and 
success to the same causes rather than assign the one as the result 
of the other. For example, the son of a wealthy manufacturer 
will be given a college education, and he will be taken into the 
firm upon graduation. Soon he becomes known as successful. 
Both the success and the education are largely due to the start 
he had. Another boy washes dishes to earn his education; then 
he begins at the bottom of a business firm, and by sheer ability 
pushes his way up. Is it not sensible to say that both his educa- 
tion and his success are largely the results of his native stuff, 
his manhood ? 
From these cases we can see that the argument based on causal 
relationship if carelessly used is treacherous. The careful thinker 
asks of every such argument two questions: (1) Is the cause as-
-P-A-G-E-259
  PITFALLS IN THINKING 259 
signed sufficient in tiself to produce the alleged result? (2) Are 
there other causes which contributed to the result which is here 
assigned to a single cause? 
Again, as in the cases of analogy and of generalization based 
upon examples, it needs to be said that arguments which involve 
the relations between causes and effects are exceedingly useful 
and very frequently are reliable. Usually several closely related 
causes operate together.. Inadequate coaching, lack of opportu- 
nity for practice, unfaithful observance of training rules, infe- 
riority in weight or speed, any one of these causes actually de- 
cides the victory in many football games. Reasonable intelligence, 
persistent and faithful study, alert attentiveness, the willingness 
to go beyond assigned tasks—these are undeniable causes of good 
scholarship. Just so in all affairs of life, causes, multitudes of 
them, are operating. A good thinker is one who, by applying the 
tests which we have named, is able reasonably to safeguard both 
what he reads and hears and what he says and writes against the 
many dangers which lurk in this field of reasoning. 
(D) The danger of reasoning through ambiguous terms 
Ambiguous terms are words and phrases that have two or 
more meanings. The danger of error lies in assuming that a 
term actually means what upon a surface examination it seems 
to mean. This can most easily be explained by illustrations, 
A few years before the World War a famous American made 
an extended trip around the world. He returned to the United 
States full of enthusiasm for the rapid growth in all countries 
of the power and influence of the common people. He saw the 
signs of popular uprising in Russia; he found the agitation for 
wider suffrage in England; he witnessed the progress toward 
democratic government in China; he observed the social revolu- 
tion in Japan; everywhere this man saw spreading a great popu- 
lar movement for human rights. Of course, as a good American 
he heartily approved this tendency toward a wider democracy, 
including in this term all that it means in its broadest sense. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
Obviously, however, he committed a serious error, when upon 
his return he went up and down the land telling the young men 
that if they wanted to be in line with a world-wide democratic 
movement they must identify themselves with the Democratic 
party. His mistake lay in using as identical the terms “Democ- 
racy” and “Democratic party.” In the large sense the Repub- 
liean, the Socialist, and the Progressive parties are just as 
devoted to Democracy as was the Democratic party. Indeed, the 
seeming similarity of the title of the last-named party to the 
term “Democracy” is in itself no argument that this party has 
a monopoly of devotion to that great principle. 
The caution to be exercised by one who would guard against 
the danger now under consideration is this: Be certain that 
every technical term and every term of doubtful meaning is most 
clearly defined in your own mind; make certain that all partici- 
pants in a discussion have in mind exactly the same kind of “old 
age pension,” “honor system,” “income tax,” “reciprocity with 
Canada,” “increase in the navy,” “commission government,” or 
any such term that has a doubtful meaning.

education makes for success in life. 
(b) “European nations are militaristic.” 
(c) Americans are superior to other peoples. 
(d) The Chinese may be judged by the coolie laundrymen of

. 2. Bring to class a paragraph including an argument which in your 
opinion exemplifies one of the four errors of “Pitfalls in Thinking.” 
Let each student read his paragraph aloud in class. Each student 
should make entries on a sheet of paper for all the paragraphs as 
follows: 
1, James. False analogy. 
2. Mary. Incorrect cause. 
3. Make upon the board a list of topics concerning which, for reliable 
information, most of the people of your city are absolutely dependent 
on others. 
4. How do the voters of a large city form their estimates of candi- 
dates whom they cannot possibly know? What helpful means of public- 
ity is there in your community? 
5. Report a set of facts in the current life of your school about which 
there are two quite different interpretations. 
6. Is a man who thinks he is arguing correctly, but whose reasoning 
is faulty, free from responsibility? Can he be charged with a breach 
of ethics? Give an example. 
7. “John studies hard and receives good marks; if I study hard I 
shall receive good marks.” Name circumstances in which this think- 
ing would be sound; name others in which it would be questionable. 
8. Secure a volume of Wendell Phillips’s addresses. Locate his ad- 
dress on “Toussaint L’Ouverture.” Read it to see how he uses figures 
of speech to make his meaning plain. Consider whether he uses these 
figures of speech as arguments, and if so, whether they are conclusive. 
9. Consider the paragraph on page 258 about college education 
and success. Recall Mr. Foster’s selection in Chapter I, page 36. Is 
there inconsistency between the two portions of THE Minp at Work? 
10. Define the terms “literary society,” “honor society,” “fraternity,” 
“school club,” “dramatic society,” to show how confusion of meaning

might easily result. In a certain legislature one “up-state” representa- 
tive opposed a bill to abolish secret “fraternities” in the state university 
beeause he, forsooth, believed heartily in “literary societies”; he made a 
long speech defending such societies. Explain his error. 
11. In another state legislature one man argued that the state univer- 
sity might very well discontinue all but a few of its courses. “Why,” 
he said, “I was a student there ten years ago and I couldn’t take all the 
courses they offered at that time. Now they have three times as many.” 
What error in thinking did he commit? 
12. Can one have an intelligently developed prejudice? Remember 
that prejudice may mean pre-judging. 
13. Name and discuss some prejudices, both good and bad, that are 
current in your community. 
14. Apply the figure of unscrambling eggs (page 253) to the problem 
of fixing the boundaries of European nations at the close of the World 
War. 
15. Mathematical axioms like “Things equal to the same thing are 
equal to each other” are statements of perfect or indisputable generali- 
zations. Why is it difficult, if not impossible, to establish similar axioms 
in regard to human relations? 
16. Why are baseball pitchers usually poor batters? Why are out- 
fielders usually good batters? 
17. There is an old statement, “The exception proves the rule.” In 
this sentence the word “proves” has a meaning which we seldom give to 
it. The exception tests the rule would be more accurate. Try to illus- 
trate how one exception may test, but not prove, a rule. Suppose, for 
example, the boys on your football team are good students, all but 
one. The rule is “Our football team is made up of good students.” 
The one boy is the exception that tests the rule. Can you think of 
similar examples? 
18. Find instances in which like effects do not have like causes; vice 
versa, instances in which like causes do not produce like effects. 
19. What is the danger in using as questions for debates: “Washing- 
ton was a greater man than Lincoln”; “Physics is a more interest-

  SECTION IV 
PITFALLS IN THINKING, PART II 
Reading Suggestions 
1. Without turning back to Part I of “Pitfalls in Thinking,” test 
yourself by enumerating the names of the four fallacies there dis- 
cussed. Write down the names of the four, and after each jot down 
eatchwords indicating the outstanding example you recall from your 
elass discussion. 
2. Part II adds four other common errors: 
(EZ) Thinking based on unsupported assertion. 
(F) Thinking based on objections. 
(G) Thinking “beside the point.” 
(H) Thinking that shifts ground. 
Study slowly, trying to supply at least one example of your own for 
each of the errors. 
(EZ) The danger of unsupported assertion 
An unsupported statement carries no weight except when 
made by an authority. A statement made by Thomas A. Edi- 
son in the field of electricity is final for the average person. An 
authority has spoken. Conclusive and convincing also may be 
considered a statement of Luther Burbank in the field of horti- 
culture. He is an authority for most people. But if either Edi- 
son or Burbank should express an unsupported opinion about 
a subject like banking or some method of conducting the 
public schools, he would in all probability be talking about a 
subject upon which he cannot be considered an authority. A 
eareful thinker will refuse to accept such opinions, even coming 
263 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
from well-known men, unless they are supported by facts and 
reasons. 
The danger arising from this source lies just here: Most of 
our information comes from reading or from hearing others 
talk. No one has opportunity to learn by personal observation 
many of the actual facts in the big life about us. We have to 
rely upon the statements of others. Moreover, we get our infor- 
mation largely from people who believe as we do. If we are 
Socialists we read the Socialist press. If we are Democrats we 
peruse the Democratic press; Republicans, the Republican press. 
Add to this the fact that the public enjoys reading and hearing 
what it already believes. Knowing this, newspapers and speak- 
ers very often cater to the taste of their own special reading 
public. They state as facts things that they know their readers 
would like to believe. 
Two newspapers reported a speech of a certain senator. The 
paper opposed to him asserted that the galleries of the Senate 
Chamber were almost empty, that senators gave but indifferent 
attention, and that the effect of his speech had been discredited 
beforehand by the action of his opponents in withdrawing cer- 
tain details of the bill. The paper friendly to the senator in 
reporting the same speech gave its readers exactly the opposite 
impression. It asserted that huge crowds thronged the gal- 
leries, that senators gave careful attention, and that the with- 
drawal of certain details of the bill had been done in fear of 
the senator’s attack. Each paper represented the facts in the 
light that best fitted in with the editorial policy of the paper 
and which in all likelihood best suited the desires of its readers. 
Thousands of readers thought they had reliable information. 
Who can say what the facts of the ease really were? 
Tf, then, we are not to accept the unsupported assertion of any 
man unless he is an undoubted authority in the field in which 
his statements lie, it behooves us to have tests by which we can 
determine an authority. This we can do if we ask the following | 
questions :
-P-A-G-E-265
  PITFALLS IN THINKING 265 
. Who wrote this article I am now reading? 
Who is the man who made the statement ? 
Did he have a good chance to make complete observation ? 
Is he capable of observing accurately what he reports? 
Is he capable of forming, from carefully observed facts, 
expert judgments in the subject under discussion ? 
6. Has he a personal ax to grind? Is he prejudiced in the 
matter? sR eR E 
(F) The danger of raising objections 
Did you ever stop to think how easy it is to raise objections? 
Any serious proposal involves some difficulties to be overcome. 
Moreover, there are always plenty of people who see these objec- 
tions and vigorously point them out. The world is full of chronic 
“objectors.” The point to remember is that merely raising objec- 
tions against a program does not necessarily imply that the 
proposal ought to be rejected. 
To illustrate: Suppose that it is proposed in a certain town- 
ship to abolish all the one-room rural schools and to substitute 
in the center of the district a graded consolidated school. Imme- 
diately, people will begin to object on the grounds (1) that the 
plan will cost too much, (2) that some pupils will have to walk 
too far, and (3) that farm lands near which the district schools 
are placed will diminish in value. 
Now, these objections may or may not be valid. Grant for a 
moment that they are valid. A careful thinker says to the 
objector, “Over against these possible objections let us balance 
the advantages which are said to follow consolidation: (1) The 
central building will be more sanitary, (2) the teachers will be 
more highly trained, (3) the school equipment will be more 
adequate, (4) the school will be far better graded.” The care- 
ful thinker continues: ‘Now, we have on the one side certain 
advantages and on the other side certain objections. It is my 
business to do three things: (1) to convince myself that the 
positive advantages will follow, (2) to determine how serious
-P-A-G-E-266
  266 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
the objections are, and (3) to balance the good and the bad 
over against each other in order to find where the greater weight 
of desirability lies.” 
To be remembered also is the fact that the advocate of a new 
movement must not content himself merely with pointing out 
the advantages of his proposals. It may very well be the case 
that all the advantages he claims for his plan may be admitted 
and still some insuperable objection may render his scheme 
untenable. A parcel post which would drive all local merchants 
into distress, or into bankruptcy, would be undesirable, whatever 
its possible advantages. The zone charges in our present system, 
supposed to give local merchants an advantage in local markets, 
were the result of an effort to meet such an objection. 
Any debatable question has two sides; there is truth both for 
and against. Do not, therefore, lend an ear to the advocate who 
gives his opponent no ground upon which to stand. Avoid giving 
your credence to the man who does not give the other side a 
chance. Listen to the man who asserts that, weighing the good 
and the bad on both sides, giving all interests a fair show to 
speak for themselves, he believes that his side has the greater 
amount of good and the less of evil. 
(G) The danger of arguing “beside the point” 
What is the real meaning of the expression, “He is talking 
beside the point”? How can a man be defending, let us say, the 
closed shop, and still be “beside the point’? 
If a man argues that the closed shop infringes upon the right 
to work there, when, and how one chooses, the reply is sometimes 
made, “Closed shops secure shorter hours.” 
If he contends that the closed shop is monopolistic in princi- 
ple, that it applies to labor the same limitations which individual 
monopolies are said to apply to their products, he meets with 
the reply, “The closed shop secures better wages.” 
Note that in both cases, instead of making reply to the ques- 
tion raised, the advocate of the closed shop has dodged the point. 
He has not attempted to answer the question, but has gone off on
-P-A-G-E-267
  PITFALLS IN THINKING 267 
one of his stock arguments. Of course shorter hours, better 
wages, and more sanitary conditions are powerful arguments in 
behalf of the closed shop; they may even be considered the very 
heart of the question. The illustration is advanced to show that 
even with an entirely legitimate and sound argument, a writer 
or speaker may be failing to talk upon the issue which, for the 
moment, has a right to the center of attention. 
This form of error appears frequently in the speeches and 
writings of various kinds of reformers. Let us say that the 
speaker believes in compulsory insurance for workingmen. He 
believes that the burden of accidents ought not to fall upon the 
injured workman, but ought to come out of the profits of the 
industry itself. Well and good. There is no reason why he 
should use all his time, or any large share of it, in showing the 
rapid growth in the number of accidents in mines, on railways, 
and in manufacturing establishments. There is no reason why 
he should spend any large amount of energy in recounting the 
hardships of an injured man and his family, when accident stops 
his earning power. Both of these lines of thought are appro- 
priate. It is quite possible that they need to be suggested; but 
a moment’s reflection ought to tell the speaker that a thoughtful 
audience will accept such points with no extended argument. He 
ought, therefore, to dwell upon them but very briefly. He ought 
to pass to points upon which real difference of opinion is possi- 
ble. In short, he is guilty of being “beside the point” whenever 
he wastes time on unessentials, thus failing to save his main 
strength for the vital issues. 
More frequently than in any other form, this error of arguing 
“beside the point” appears in the common practice called “mud- 
slinging”—heaping personal abuse on an opponent. Frequently 
in campaigns, when speakers are unable to talk upon the real 
issues, they pour out slanderous remarks about the personalities 
of their opponents. And it used to be a common saying in law- 
suits, “When you have no case, abuse the other attorney.” Such 
lby-play is usually “beside the point.” Be suspicious of such a 
writer or speaker.
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
(H) The danger of shifting ground 
“As slippery as an eel,” runs the old saw. Many writers and 
speakers rival the eel in slipping out from under a hand that 
attempts to pin them down. They glide skillfully from one argu- 
ment to another, insinuating, “Well, if you object to that last 
point, let us consider another. Now, even if you do not accept 
the second argument, please lend your ear to my third conten- 
tion.” Such men are especially gifted in the shifting process 
when brought face to face with an opponent who attempts to 
pin them down to definite arguments. 
A certain township in a Middle-Western state was considering 
the advisability of abandoning all the one-room rural schools 
and substituting for them a consolidated school. Opposed to 
consolidation there was a vigorous gentleman whose arguments 
constantly shifted ground. As most opponents of any new 
scheme are likely to do, this man began by arguing that the plan 
would cost too much. He said that the value of farm lands near 
the small schools would decrease when the little buildings were 
removed. But by interrupting from the floor, someone showed 
that this argument is weak; that to have a larger consolidated 
school two miles away adds more to the value of a farm than to 
have a poor school on the corner of your farm. 
Smilingly, the opponent of consolidated schools slipped out of 
this untenable position into a second. He said the value of farm 
lands would diminish, because the taxes would be much higher 
in order to sustain a consolidated school. Then it was pointed 
out to him that, granting quite a large initial expense for the 
new building, the running expenses over a period of ten years 
for one large building would be less than for eight small ones; 
that four teachers, even if paid more, could be employed for 
less than eight teachers under the old one-room system. Driven 
out of this position, the debater sought refuge in a third. He 
contended that it would cost too much to transport the pupils 
in wagons or busses to the new building. To this, reply was made 
that only four wagons would be necessary; that four of the
-P-A-G-E-269
  PITFALLS IN THINKING 269 
largest school-boys could drive the wagons; and that for the 
larger part of the school year, teams for the busses could be 
secured very cheaply. With seemingly little reluctance, the 
opponent of consolidated schools abandoned even this third point 
and turned to other arguments. 
This is a good example of shifting ground. Pressed hard in 
one position, the speaker or writer shifts from the original argu- 
ment he started to support, to a second, thence to a third, and 
so on, easily rivaling the eel. 
This exasperating practice ought to discredit any speaker or 
writer. One ought to be sure that he knows what the vital and 
important issues in a case are, and he ought to stand squarely 
for them. From his position he should refuse to be driven. It is 
a safe rule, usually, to give your credence to a writer or speaker 
who fights it out on one line “if it takes all summer.” Of course, 
this does not mean that he merely goes over and over the same 
ground. It means that he presents new evidence and more con- 
vineing evidence, on essential points that seem not yet to have 
been firmly established. 
Conclusion 
If you have been interested in this discussion of eight very 
common forms of errors in reasoning, turn to the list of terms. 
which have been given to these various fallacies (pages 253 and 
263) ; commit these terms to memory, and in connection with 
each, remember not the words but the ideas of the most striking 
illustration presented. The tests of faulty reasoning may be used 
as a sort of formula. Against this formula, fixed in your mind 
by the concrete illustrations, hold up any statement which you 
may question. See if you can place it accurately alongside of 
one of these undoubted errors. If you can, you ought certainly 
to hesitate to accept the argument in which it is found; you ought 
even more to hesitate to use the argument if it is your own. 
Constant endeavor to be on his guard against. the faulty rea- 
soning of men who ask him to accept their word, and constant 
endeavor to prevent his own thinking and talking from going 
astray, are marks of an efficient man.

2. What fallacy is Webster charging against his opponents? 
The prisoner’s counsel catch at supposed flaws of evidence, or bad 
character of witnesses, without meeting the case. Do they mean to deny 
conspiracy? Why do they rail against Palmer, while they do not dis- 
prove, and hardly dispute the truth of any fact sworn to by him? Do 
they mean to deny the conspiracy? If a conspiracy is proved, it bears 
closely upon every subsequent subject of inquiry. Why do they not 
come to the fact? The counsel neither take the ground nor abandon it. 
They neither fly nor light. They hover.

Suggestions for Reading 
1. Mr. Bryce uses a startling expression, “the vice commonly called 
‘the reading habit.’” Find the setting in Mr. Bryce’s thinking in which 
this statement is made. Consider his argument in the light of the title 
of this selection. 
2. During your reading, determine what great publie duty seems to 
be inevitably placed upon intelligent citizens by Mr. Bryce’s conclusion 
in this article. 
3. Pause in your reading to think of examples of public issues upon 
which it is difficult to find unpartisan statements in the public press. 
Think of other issues upon which the average voter can do little more 
than make a rough guess. 
The deficient sense of civic duty, though most frequently 
noted in the form of a neglect to vote, is really more general and 
serious in the neglect to think. Were it possible to have statis- 
ties to show what percentage of those who vote reflect upon the 
ballot they have to cast, there would in no country be found a 
large percentage. Yet what is the worth of a vote except as the 
expression of a considered opinion? The act of marking a ballot 
is nothing unless the mark carries with it a judgment, the pref- 
erence of a good candidate to a bad one, the approval of one 
policy offered the people, the rejection of another. The citizen 
owes it to the community to inform himself about the questions

submitted for his decision, and weigh the arguments on each side; 
or if the issue be one rather of persons than of policies, to learn 
all he can regarding the merits of the candidates offered to his 
choice. 
How many voters really trouble themselves to do this? One in 
five? One in ten? One in twenty? 
It may be asked, How can they do it? What means have they 
of studying public questions and reaching just conclusions? If 
the means are wanting, can we blame them if they do not think? 
If they feel they do not understand, can we blame them if they 
do not vote? In every free country the suffrage is now so wide 
that the great majority of the voters have to labor for their daily 
bread. In most European countries many are imperfectly edu- 
eated. In the rural districts they read with difficulty, see either 
no newspaper or one which helps them but little, lead isolated 
lives in which there are scanty opportunities for learning what 
passes, so that the best they can do seems to be to ask advice 
from the priest, or the village schoolmaster, or take advice from 
their landlord or their employer. In parts of the United States 
and also in Canada, the native population has indeed received a 
fair instruction, and reads newspapers; but the mass of voters is 
swelled by a crowd of recent immigrants, most of whom cannot 
read English and know nothing of your institutions. 
Broadly speaking, in modern countries ruled by universal 
suffrage the average citizen has not the means of adequately dis- 
charging the function which the constitution throws upon him of 
following, examining, and judging those problems of statesman- 
ship which the ever-growing range of government administration 
and the ever-increasing complexity of our civilization set before 
him as a voter to whom issues of policy are submitted. 
As things stand, he votes, when he votes, not from knowledge, 
but as his party or his favorite newspaper bids him, or according 
to his preference for some particular leader. Unless it be held 
that every man has a natural and inviolable right to a share 
in the government of the country in which he resides, the ground
-P-A-G-E-273
  THE NEGLECT TO THINK 273 
for giving that share would seem to be the competence of the 
recipient and the belief that his sharing will promote the gen- 
eral welfare. So one may almost say that the theory of universal 
suffrage assumes that the average citizen is an active, instructed, 
intelligent ruler of his country. The facts contradict this as- 
sumption. 
Does this mean that widely extended suffrage is a failure, and 
that the average man is not a competent citizen in a democracy? 
This question brings us to reflect on another branch of civic 
duty not yet mentioned. Besides the civic duties already de- 
scribed of intelligent voting and thinking, there is another duty. 
It is the duty of mutual help, the duty incumbent on those who 
possess, through their knowledge and intelligence, the capacity 
of instruction and persuasion to advise and to guide their less 
competent fellow-citizens. No sensible man ought ever to have 
supposed that under such conditions as large modern commu- 
nities present, the bulk of the citizens could vote wisely from 
their own private knowledge and intelligence. Even in small 
cities, such as Boston in the days of James Otis, the average man 
needed the help of his more educated and wiser neighbors. While 
communities remained small, this help was easy to get. But 
now the swift and vast growth of states and cities has changed 
everything. Private talk counts for less when the richer citizens 
dwell apart from the poorer; their opportunities of meeting are 
fewer, and there is less friendliness, if also less dependence, in the 
relation of the employed to the employer. Public meetings do 
not give nearly all that the average man needs, not to add that 
being assembled to present one set of facts and arguments 
and deliberately to ignore the other, they do not put him in a fair 
position to judge. Besides, the men who most need instruction 
are usually those who least often come to meetings to receive it. 
To fill this void the newspapers have arisen—organs purport- 
ing to supply the materials required for the formation of political 
opinion. Whatever the services of the newspaper in other re- 
spects, it has the inevitable defect of superseding, with most of 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  274 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
those who read it, the exercise of independent thought. The 
newspaper—I speak generally, for there are some brilliant excep- 
tions—is, in Europe even more than here, almost always partisan 
in its views, often partisan in its selection of facts or at least in 
its way of stating them. Presenting one side of a case, address- 
ing those who are already adherents of that side, putting a color 
on the events it reports—it serves up to the reader ideas, per- 
haps only mere phrases or catchwords, which confirm him in his 
prepossessions, and by its daily iteration makes him take them 
for truths. Seldom has he the leisure, still more seldom the 
impulse or the patience, to scrutinize these ideas for himself and 
form his own judgment. He is glad to be relieved of the neces- 
sity for thinking, because thinking is hard work. Indolence 
again! The habit of mind that is formed by hasty reading, and 
especially by the reading of newspapers and magazines in which 
the matter, excellent as parts of it often are, is so multifarious 
that one topic diverts attention from the others, tends to a gen- 
eral dissipation and distraction of thought. It is a habit which 
_ tells upon us all and makes continuous reflection and a critical 
or logical treatment of the subjects deserving reflection more 
irksome to us in the full sunlight of today than it was to those 
whom we call our benighted ancestors. 
This is only one form of that supplanting of the practice of 
thinking by the vice commonly called “the reading habit” which 
is profoundly affecting the intellectual life of our time. Yet as 
steady thinking was never really common even among the edu- 
eated, the difference from earlier days is not so correctly de- 
scribed by saying that people think less than formerly, as by 
noting that while people read more, and while far more people 
read, the ratio of thinking to reading does not increase either 
in the individual or in the mass, and may possibly be decreasing. 
Intelligence and independence of thought have not grown in 
proportion to the diffusion of knowledge. The number of per- 
sons who both read and vote is in England and France more than 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE NEGLECT TO THINK 275 
twenty times as great as it was seventy years ago. The percent- 
age of those who reflect before they vote has not kept pace either 
with popular education or with the extension of the suffrage. 
The persons who constitute that percentage are, and must for 
the reasons already given continue for some time to be, only a 
fraction, in some countries a small fraction, of the voting popu- 
lation. But the fraction might be made much larger than it is. 
The citizens who stand above their fellows in knowledge and 
mental power ought to set an example, not only by themselves 
thinking more and thinking harder about public affairs than 
most of them do, but also by exerting themselves to stimulate 
and aid their less instructed or more listless neighbors. The 
voter, it is said, should be independent. Yes. But independence 
does not mean isolation. He must not commit his personal 
responsibility to the keeping of another. Yes. But personal 
responsibility does not mean the vain conceit of knowledge and 
judgment where knowledge is wanting and judgment is un- 
trained. 
Just as his religion throws upon every Christian the duty of 
loving his neighbor and giving practical expression to his love 
by helping his neighbor, succoring him in the hour of need, try- 
ing to rescue him from sin, seeking to guide his steps into the 
way of peace, so civic duty requires each of us to raise the level 
of citizenship not merely by ourselves voting and bearing a share 
in political agitation, but by trying to diffuse among our fellow- 
citizens whose opportunities have been less favorable, the knowl- 
edge and the fairness of mind and the habit of grappling with 
political questions which a democratic government must demand 
even from the average man. 
Democracy, they say, is based on equality. But in no form of 
government is leadership so essential. A multitude without 
intelligent, responsible leaders whom it respects and follows is 
a crowd ready to become the prey of any self-seeking knave. 
Nor is it true that because men value equality they reject

eminence. They are always glad to be led if someone, avoiding 
pretension and condescension, speaking to them with respect, 
but also with that authority which knowledge and capacity 
imply, will point out the path and give them the lead for which 
they are looking. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Questions for Discussion 
1. Do you think that Mr. Bryce really answers the vital question he 
asks on page 273: “Does this mean that widely extended suffrage is a 
failure, and that the average man is not a competent eitizen in a 
democracy?” Explain. 
2. What is the effect upon a reader of the constant, unvarying ap- 
pearance in a daily paper of a phrase, “Our country, right or wrong,” 
even though he pay little attention to it? Consider the extension of 
your answer into the field of advertising, into the field of campaign 
slogans. Bryce says “daily iterating makes him [a reader] take them 
for truths.” 
3. Could the charge made by Bryce, that the daily press is supersed- 
ing the practice of individual thinking, be extended to the effect of the 
movies? Explain. 
4, What tragedy is represented by a man who recognizes the danger 
of newspaper “stuff” but who bases his opinions entirely on it? 
5. In the light of Mr. Bryce’s last paragraph, describe the person- 
ality of a leader. 
6. Why are the accounts of political affairs rarely the same in lead- 
ing newspapers? 
7. What would Mr. Bryce say about the citizen who does not vote? 
8. Into which of the “Pitfalls in Thinking,” pages 251-269, are 
ignorant voters most likely to fall? 
9. Is there justification for Bryce’s charge: “the vice commonly 
ealled the reading habit”? 
10. How are voters in your community educated on public questions?

NEWSPAPERS AND THE TRUTH! 
Frepertck L, ALLEN 
Reading Suggestions 
Mr. Frederick L. Allen discusses several sources of error in articles 
by the public press. Notice that the discussion centers around six key 
ideas: I, The Importance of Newspaper Ethics; II, Bias as the Enemy 
of Truth; III, Careless Selection of News; IV, Indifference to the 
Truth; V, Making a Small Story Big or Breezy; and VI, The Advance 
in Newspaper Ethics. 
I 
It is a significant fact that public interest in newspaper ethies 
and the conduct of the press was never so widespread in this 
country as it is today. The war, with the improvement which 
it brought about in methods of swaying masses of men by con- 
trolling or doctoring the news, has made us realize that the 
problem of newspaper conduct is more fundamental than we 
had supposed it to be. We now see that it is immensely impor- 
tant that the press shall give us the facts straight; and- not 
merely the facts relating to department stores and other large 
business concerns, but the entire mass of facts about the world 
in which we live—political, economic, religious, scientific, social, 
and industrial. 
It is beginning to be understood that access to accurate ae- 
counts of what is going on about us is one of the indispensable

conditions of freedom. We talk a great deal about the right of 
the individual to express his opinions, and somewhat less about 
the advantage to the community, or the nation, or the world, 
of determining its collective action after the freest discussion ; 
but we are just beginning to see that it is still more vital that 
the individual shall be able to form his opinion upon the facts. 
If the facts are withheld from him or misrepresented to him, 
his opinion is as valueless as that of a judge who has heard 
incomplete or false evidence in a case. Though the individual 
may be at liberty to shout his ideas from the housetops, he is 
still a slave to illusion; and all the more completely a slave than 
if he were in bonds, because he fancies that he walks freely in 
the light. 
There never was such an age of newspaper-reading as the 
present. Most of us read—or at least glance at—one, two, or 
more newspapers a day. They are the eyes through which 
largely we see the life of our time, and the news that they print 
is in great measure the raw material of our ideas. Nothing is 
more important than that through these eyes we shall see, not 
a distorted picture, but the reality. It is often contended in 
England, where the Northcliffe press wields far more power than 
any existing group of American newspapers, and it is occasion- 
ally contended in this country by those who take a gloomy view 
of affairs, that the public is at the mercy of the lords of the 
press, who feed it such garbled news as will best serve their own 
selfish purposes. Other critics assure us that the ethics of the 
newspaper profession are higher today than those of any other. 
It would seem worth while to consider the whole matter afresh, 
and decide for ourselves what the public interest requires of the 
press in the interest of truth, and how far these requirements 
are being met. 
The public interest requires that all unsigned news on the 
news pages—all news, in other words, which does not bear its 
own tag, to warn the reader that he is seeing the facts through 
the spectacles of somebody’s personal opinion—shall be presented
-P-A-G-E-279
  
NEWSPAPERS AND THE TRUTH 279 
as accurately and impartially as is humanly possible. On the 
editorial page every newspaper proprietor or editor has a right 
to state his views as forcibly as he wishes. Papers also have an 
unquestionable right to commission correspondents to include in 
their dispatches their personal view of events, provided these 
dispatches are signed. The imperative need is that what the 
press presents as fact shall be fact, given correctly and without 
bias. 
II 
Bias is all the more completely the enemy of truth on account 
of the slovenly way in which most of us are accustomed to read 
the papers. For every report we weigh thoroughly for our- 
selves, checking the generalizations and summaries in headline 
and leading paragraph by the details which follow, there are ten 
that we only glance at. Usually we carry away nothing but the 
dim impression that Mr. X has done something disastrous, or 
that Governor Y has made another fine speech; we retain the 
bias, and little else. If you doubt that you yourself skim the 
paper in this way, try handing the paper to somebody else after 
you have finished, and making him examine you on the contents 
of an important article. You will probably soon realize how 
vaguely most of your news-reading is done, and understand how 
easily the twist of a phrase in headline or leading paragraph, 
by giving a biased impression, may cause thousands of readers 
to form opinions based, not on the facts, but on somebody else’s 
view of the facts. 
This cardinal rule of newspaper ethics—that what is pre- 
sented as sheer fact should be accurate and without bias—is easy 
to state. It is harder to live up to than anybody can imagine 
who has not faced the newspaper man’s problem for himself. 
In the first place, it is hard for a reporter, just as for any 
other person, to give an absolutely accurate account of any event, 
even when he has seen it with his own eyes. The fallibility of 
even first-hand evidence from eyewitnesses is well known; no
-P-A-G-E-280
  280 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
one can read a book like the late Professor Munsterberg’s On the 
Witness Stand without appreciating the difficulties of the re- 
porter. Furthermore, it is also exceedingly hard to write an 
account of any event without coloring it with one’s own opin- 
ions. Though the reporter has every intention of stating only 
the clear facts, he may give them bias simply through his choice 
of language. 
Suppose one senator denounces another in a speech. Shall the 
reporter write, “Senator A- sternly rebuked Senator B eh 
or shall he use the words “vigorously attacked,” or “sharply 
attacked,” or “fiercely attacked”? If he decides upon “sternly 
rebuked,” he seems to favor Senator <A: , who uttered the 
rebuke; if he says “fiercely attacked,” he gives no such favorable 
impression, and the reader tends instinctively to side with the 
senator who was attacked. Shall he, in describing an automobile 
accident, say, “The truck was going at a terrific rate,” or content 
himself with, “The truck was said to have been going thirty miles 
an hour,” and leave the reader to decide whether this was a 
“terrific” rate for a truck to be going at in that place at that 
time? 
Or suppose he must give an account of something really dif- 
ficult to record objectively—the applause, let us say, which 
greeted the closing sentence of President’s Harding’s inaugural 
address. Was it enthusiastic or perfunctory; was it general, or 
half-hearted and scattered? The truth here is a matter of judg- 
ment. One man thinks the applause large, because he knows 
beforehand how hard it is to hear a public speech out of doors 
without distractions, and therefore expects something less im- 
pressive than actually occurs. Another man, who comes to the 
inaugural expecting an ovation, is disappointed. Then again, the 
reporter’s political sympathies, his personal opinion of Mr. 
Harding, and his own enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm for the 
address are almost sure to influence his judgment of the facts. 
If he were the crack reporter of an opposition paper, he might,     
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  NEWSPAPERS AND THE TRUTH 281 
with every intention of giving the exact truth, write something 
like this, which appeared in the New York Times on the morn- 
ing of March 5, 1921: 
Mr. Harding has a good voice, and the amplifier in the roof of 
the kiosk carried his voice as far as the House and Senate office- 
buildings. Considering that the average inaugural address is 
audible only to those who stand within fifteen feet of the Presi- 
dent, this was an enormous improvement, and enabled the crowd 
to manifest its feelings, when it had any, with something like 
spontaneity. 
The address was only thirty-seven minutes long, and Mr. 
Harding delivered its final pledge with a devout solemnity which 
did not fail to have its effect on the crowd. 
There was a roar of applause as he concluded and turned 
to receive the congratulations of those nearby, Vice President 
Coolidge being the first to shake hands with him. 
Another reporter of Democratic sympathies might. regard the 
applause as Mr. Louis Seibold did in his dispatch to the New 
York World. After noting earlier in his account that “Five 
times his [President Harding’s] reading was interrupted by 
applause, but at no time was there a demonstration in which all 
of the people gathered in front of him united,” he quoted the 
President’s peroration and then wrote: 
The applause that approved this sentiment was rather more 
general than had followed any other statement made by the new 
President. Before it had died away, and while the Marine Band 
was rendering the national anthem, the crowd began to melt 
away. Mr. Harding acknowledged the congratulations that were 
showered upon him by the members of his Cabinet and the lead- 
ers of the two Houses. 
If, on the other hand, the reporter were favorably inclined 
toward Mr. Harding and impressed with the speech, he might 
see its reception as did the correspondent of the New York 
Herald, who quoted President Harding’s final sentence and then 
continued : 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  282 EVALUATING WHAT WE READ 
There was a palpable moment of absolute silence. The Presi- 
dent remained as if transfixed. The small group standing with 
him in the white-covered stand seemed stayed from speech or 
action by the deep and moving solemnity of the voluntary prom- 
ise. Then a wave of applause. started up from the fringe of the 
crowd nearest the portico, rolled backward and to the right and 
left, carried through the massed thousands, and became a solid 
roar. The President waved a hand in happy acknowledgment 
and turned to meet the eager compliments of his friends. 
Readers of the Herald on that March 5 must have thought the 
address an immense success; readers of the Times and World 
undoubtedly gained quite a different opinion; and yet each cor- 
respondent may have described the event conscientiously as it 
appeared to him. In such cases it is almost impossible not to let 
personal feeling color one’s report. 
Ill 
News may also be colored in the process of selection as well as 
in that of presentation. Let me take an example such as fre- 
quently occurs in my own experience. It is my duty to give to 
the press the news of a great university. I do not happen to be 
a newspaper reporter, but my problem is essentially the same 
as the reporter’s. When the university’s enrollment figures for 
the year are made up, the Freshman Class shows a gain in num- 
bers. If, in my announcement to the press, I compare the 1921 
figures with those of 1920, or with those of any other year since 
the war, the gain looks very large. On the other hand, if I com- 
pare them with those of 1911, when the Freshman Class hap- 
pened to be unusually big, the gain looks less impressive. If I 
mention the fact that part of the gain is caused by a difference 
in the method of classifying undergraduates, which automatically 
adds to the Freshman Class a number of men who were formerly 
listed elsewhere, it looks still less significant. There are thus 
three or four ways of making the statement. Even though I am
-P-A-G-E-283
  NEWSPAPERS AND THE TRUTH 283 
honestly anxious to give an accurate impression, it is hard to 
decide just what facts to select for presentation. And there is, 
of course, always a temptation to make the gain look more impos- 
‘ing than it actually is. 
Or let us suppose that a reporter is sent to cover a dinner. 
Shall he devote his leading paragraph to the size and enthusiasm 
of the gathering, or to the consternation caused by the single 
untoward event of the evening—a violent and inappropriate 
statement made by one of the speakers? This again is a ques- 
tion of selection. Sometimes it is a toss-up in the reporter’s 
mind between the two treatments of the event; and yet the opin- 
ion which thousands of readers form of the organization which 
held the dinner may depend on this apparently unimportant 
decision. 
An added element of difficulty is caused by the speed with 
which newspapers have to work, and the circumstance that much 
of the color of a story is necessarily given it in the newspaper 
office by men who lack a first-hand acquaintance with the facts. 
There is no opportunity to wait a few hours for a chance to 
check facts; they are usually worthless unless given to the public 
instantly. City reporters telephone much of their news to the 
office, where their statements are taken down hurriedly in a 
telephone booth, and then thrown into shape by a member of the 
office staff. Always the headlines are written by the office staff; 
they have to be, because the reporter cannot tell what size and 
style of headline is needed, and because the writing of headlines 
requires a special training. The man who concocts them must 
read each news-story rapidly and write his “head” promptly. 
He cannot waste time upon niceties of emphasis; the all-impor- 
tant thing for him is that the head shall have exactly the right 
number of letters to fill its space, and that it shall be original 
and dramatic enough to catch the reader’s attention. Like the 
reporter, he finds that bias insists on creeping into his presenta- 
tion of the gist of the news.  
-P-A-G-E-284

IV 
Most newspaper inaccuracy is not, however, the result so 
much of the inherent difficulty of properly collecting and pre- 
senting the facts, as of the ignorance, carelessness, and thought- 
less indifference to truth of a considerable proportion of news- 
paper men. 
By the very nature of newspaper organization, the men sent 
out on assignments usually know too little about the matter in 
hand. One day a man is instructed to get a story on the immi- 
gration problem ; the next day, he has to write a breezy interview 
on a bootlegging case; the next day, he may have to report the 
visit of Dr. Einstein to a university. He has not the time, even 
if he had the inclination, to make a preliminary study of the 
immigration problem, the liquor laws, and the theory of relativ- 
ity. Newspapers try to develop special abilities in their reporters 
and, so far as possible, to keep men assigned to the subjects 
which they know about; but the field of news is so immense that 
much of it has to be covered by inexpert men. Besides, many 
reporters have only a limited education; they know so little that 
they have no idea how their ignorance handicaps them. And 
they generally tend to be careless. Their immediate object is 
usually to get the most newsy and sensational story they can. If 
they are being paid at space-rates, a breezy story which pleases 
the jaded eye of the city editor will be printed and will put 
money in their pockets. If they are salaried reporters, such a 
story will at least give them prestige with the critics at the city 
desk. No reporter wants to get the reputation of returning 
empty-handed, or with a dull story. The temptation is to make 
a bluff at knowing the subject, and slap the story together any- 
how. 
Here, for instance, are the headlines and the first two para- 
graphs of an item which appeared lately in a Boston paper:

DISCOVERS NEW NEBULAR MASS 
PROF. SLIPHE OF HARVARD FINDS IT GOING AT 
RECORD SPEED 
Prof. V. M. Sliphe of Harvard, stationed at the Flagstaff, 
Ariz., Observatory, peered through his telescope a few nights 
ago, according to a dispatch received at the Cambridge Observa- 
tory, and much to his surprise saw a faint, cloud-like, self- 
luminous mass of attenuated matter situated far outside the solar 
system, traveling at the rate of 2000 kilometers per second. This 
rate of speed is twice as great as the fastest nebula yet discovered 
and 100 times greater than the average speed of the lowly star. 
In fact, it is the greatest velocity known to astronomy. 
The telescope at Flagstaff is situated on San Francisco peak 
at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Harvard astronomers are mani- 
festing much interest in the matter because of its supposed great 
distance from the stars ordinarily seen in the heavens and be- 
eause of the tremendous speed at which it is traveling. 
Now, the facts of the case were that the discoverer’s name was 
not Sliphe, but Slipher; that he was not connected with Harvard, 
but with the Lowell Observatory; that he did not discover the 
nebula, which had been known for a long time, but only ascer- 
tained its speed; that the telescope at Flagstaff is not at an alti- 
tude of thirteen thousand feet, but of about seven thousand ; and 
that it is not situated on San Francisco Peak, but merely in the

‘What happened was that the Lowell Observatory reported its 
discovery to the Harvard Observatory, which made a brief an- 
nouncement to the press; and the news-writer took this announce- 
ment, and tried, as he would have put it, to “make a good story 
out of it.” 
“Make a good story.” That is the cause of infinite newspaper 
inaceuracy.

The same desire often leads reporters at a public meeting to 
lay disproportionate emphasis on a sensational remark made by 
aspeaker. The remark may have little real significance, and the 
reporters may misquote it because they happen to be half asleep 
when it is made, or are not even in the room and get it second- 
hand afterward from some neighbor of uncertain memory ; but, 
if the remark seems striking enough to make a big story, that 
fact may outweigh in their minds every other consideration. 
Akin to the temptation to make a small story look big is the 
temptation to make an otherwise dignified story look breezy. 
A Boston newspaper recently printed an interview with a Har- 
vard physician on the importance of using the feet properly in 
standing and walking, as shown in the physical examinations of 
Harvard freshmen. It was an interesting interview, carefully 
prepared by an intelligent and well-equipped reporter. But 
the editor to whom the interview was submitted decided that it 
was too heavy ; it needed to be brightened up: So he headed it~

And the illustration—a photograph of the physician—the editor 
surrounded with a border of “Joys” and “Glooms,” after the 
fashion of the comic cartoons. In thus misrepresenting the 
nature of the interview, he succeeded in making ridiculous 
the man who had taken the trouble to give it; but to this par- 
ticular editor nothing mattered except that he made it look like 
the sort of low-comedy stuff to which his mind was attuned.

The newspaper profession is steadily advancing, not only in 
the effectiveness of its news-gathering machinery, but also in its 
standing in the community and in its ethical standards. Early 
in the last century there was so little recognition of the rights of 
the press that Henry Clay, making a political speech in Ken- 
tucky, ordered off the field a reporter who had the impertinence 
to report him without first getting special permission. It was 
not until some time after the beginning of the Civil War that the 
Government at Washington made satisfactory arrangements for 
issuing its news to all newspaper men simultaneously, instead of 
giving it haphazard to the first comer. Now the President and 
the members of his Cabinet confer with the press representatives 
once or twice a day; and, as a matter of course, reporters are 
given front seats at almost every kind of public occasion. 
Two generations ago the leading New York editors called each 
other blackguards and scoundrels in their editorial columns—a 
practice which today would be considered disreputable. Some 
twenty years ago Mr. Henry Watterson declared that journalism 
was “without any code of ethics or system of self-restraint and 
self-respect.” The standard of newspaper conduct and of impar- 
tiality has risen conspicuously since then. The papers of one 
political party cannot dismiss the deeds of their opponents with 
such brief notice as they could once. In the presidential cam- 
paign of 1920, a Republican paper in Boston gave more space 
than any of the Democratic papers to an appeal for Mr. Cox 
issued by a group of men in New York, while a Democratic paper 
in the same city ran a straw ballot and printed the results day by 
day on its front page, although they favored Mr. Harding. It 
must in fairness be acknowledged that most papers give front- 
page space to Mr. Gompers quite as readily as to Judge Gary. 
Editors now observe with the utmost care release dates on mate- 
rial furnished them in advance, and most newspaper men can 
be trusted with confidential information or with facts not yet 
ripe for publication.

Meanwhile, it would be well if all of us who read the news- 
papers—and that means pretty nearly everybody—knew enough 
about newspaper organization and methods to be better judges 
of the credibility of the news. I should like to see lectures on 
“How to Read the Newspapers” given in colleges and schools 
and elsewhere. It is as essential for the citizen of this day to 
be able to read the morning paper with a discriminating eye— 
to be able to distinguish the Associated Press dispatch from the 
special correspondent’s forecast of conditions, and the fact story 
from the rumor story, and to be able to take into account the 
probable bias of the paper and make allowance for it—as it is 
for a lawyer to learn to assess the value of evidence. Only as 
we are able to estimate the relative amount of credence to be 
given to conflicting reports, and to judge for ourselves the 
reliability of the sources of the news, do we come somewhere 
near seeing that true picture of the world about us which we 
must see if we are to play our part in it intelligently and 
independently. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Reading Projects 
1. Possibly you can find Walter Lippmann’s Liberty and the News 
in the publie library. If not, you can find a chapter from it in the 
Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 124; and another in the Century Magazine, 
Vol. 103. A study of one or both of these articles would reveal sev- 
eral important comparisons to be made with Mr. Allen’s article. Do 
not undertake this project without a realization that it will require 
keen thinking. Possibly some member of the class may undertake the 
task as volunteer work. : 
2. James Melvin Lee, History of American Journalism, speaks very 
highly of the ethics of the newspaper profession in America today. 
Read it to see if it causes you to accept Mr. Allen’s argument with 
some reservations.

3. Read Schaeffer, Thinking and Learning to Think, Chapter IX, 
“The Right Use of Books,” for additional cautions to present to the 
class. 
4. An article in The Outlook, Vol. 135, page 651, entitled “How 
History Is Made” reports a careful investigation of facts in order to 
defend Theodore Roosevelt’s memory against an unjust charge. Report 
on this to the elass. 
Problems and Projects 
1. Class discussion. In the light of the principles of reading so far 
considered in this book, work out a class outline entitled “The Proper 
Way to Read a Daily.” Beside it, on the blackboard, work out an out- 
line entitled “Common Errors in Reading the Daily Press.” 
2. Send a delegate to some young lawyer of your town, preferably 
one who has himself come up through your own city schools; request 
him to address your class on one of the subjects named below, or on a 
subject suggested by them: Cross-examining to Find the Truth; 
Handling an Intentionally Dishonest Witness; How the Courts Look 
upon Circumstantial Evidence; Common Weaknesses of Witnesses.

Exercises and Problems 
1. In the March, 1921, issue of The American Magazine, Dr. Frank 
Crane has an article, “Are You a Keen Observer?” It begins, “When 
I was a boy, I was once out hunting in the woods along the Kankakee 
River, near Springfield, Missouri. I was accompanied...” If you 
are a keen observer, you will recall at once that the Kankakee is not 
near Springfield, nor is it in Missouri. A large number of similar 
errors of fact and of spelling and grammar are intentionally scattered 
through the article. If possible, secure a copy, have it typed, without 
the corrections which begin on page 120 of the same magazine. Pass 
it to several of the class and see who detects the largest number of 
errors. 
2. If more people were independent thinkers there would not be a 
yearly output of millions of barrels of patent medicines, the main 
ingredients of which are alcoholic preservatives. Soothing syrups with 
opiates are fed to children because they are said to ery for them. The 
children are quieted, oftentimes so effectually as to be stupid through 
life. “Harmless vegetable remedies” is a magical phrase.—Bolton, 
page 85. 
Find advertisements of this nature in eurrent literature. Display 
them and point out their errors of reasoning. 
3. Read again Bolton’s account of superstitions, page 85. The 
number 13 is so ominous that you cannot get a room number 13 at a 
hotel, and you can scarcely have thirteen at a table. Friday is eon- 
sidered so unlucky that some steamship companies hesitate to make 
sailing dates on that day of the week. 
Report to the class similar superstitions found in your community. 
4. S. S. Seward gives a suggestive diagram in the form of “a com- 
pass-card” in making the point that an accurate summary of an article 
read or a statement heard requires a very careful discrimination in the 
selection of essential words. He says: 
Just as it makes a great difference at the end of a day’s sailing 
whether a mariner has laid out his course northeast or northeast-by- 
east, so it is with us when we aim at an idea; we can afford no inae- 
euracy in the direction indicated by our words. It is, for example, 
not enough to be able to say merely that a thing is or is not so; we 
need to pick out the more precise direction from some such compass- 
ecard as this.

the enormous decline in the German mark. Then copy from the daily 
press a few citations which will show that the values of words depend

upon what they stand for. Discuss the worth of the comparison of 
Gordy. 
8. Lincoln was a past master in the use of homely analogies to make 
his meaning clear—analogies like the “letting fall of a ball of string 
which one is carefully winding up,” as used by James on page 97. 
Secure a book’ which includes a number of Lincoln’s addresses, 
preferably his early speeches; divide the task among a number of the 
class, each taking one address. Collect and classify the homely analogies 
used in the book. Try to secure them all. You may be certain that 
any clergyman, editor, or lawyer in your city would be gratified to 
have your class present him a copy of your study, neatly prepared, 
with your compliments. 
9. A certain teacher, desiring to show her class how difficult it is to 
report accurately what they themselves actually see, tried this experi- 
ment. She and one of her students planned to act out a “case of dis- 
cipline.” The student was to bring to class a newspaper, display it 
conspicuously, and read it during the class period. Together the con- 
spirators worked out a dialogue of rebuke on the part of the teacher 
and impertinence on the part of the pupil. They rehearsed the scene 
several times till the dialogue was letter perfect. The class in the mean- 
time was totally unaware of the impending experiment. One day the 
conspirators played their scene in the class to a very real audience. 
The teacher said, after sending the student from the room, “Now this 
is a serious matter of which you are all witnesses. I want you to write 
down exactly what happened, and what was said.” 
The written reports were amazingly diiferent. 
Plan an experiment that will serve the same purpose, but of an 
entirely different nature. Carry it out in your classroom. 
10. An editorial in The World’s Work, Vol. 45, page 233, comments 
upon the haphazard way in which our public opinion is molded: 
Probably the everyday man and woman in the polling booth does not 
subject his convictions to any definite analysis. He is voting upon an 
impression, perhaps even a prejudice; he is not thinking primarily of 
politics. A reading of headlines for a year, an occasional more careful 
study of particular measures, overheard scraps of talk in clubs or offi- 
ces, now and then a heated argument in a country store—in such ways 
is forged the great instrument of democracy known as public opinion.

do great harm, and how the error in question was located and

13. What is the worth of this argument? 
In Massachusetts the average person goes to school seven years; in 
Tennessee the average person goes to school three years. In Massachu- 
setts the average income is $200.00 per person; in Tennessee it is 
$116.00. 
In the United States as a whole, the average college graduate earns 
$2000.00 a year, the average high school graduate $1000.00, the aver- 
age elementary school graduate $500.00. 
Each day spent in high school is worth $25.00 to each pupil, each day 
spent in college $55.55. This is more than the average boy or girl 
can earn by leaving school and going to work. 
Does education pay?

READING FoR ENJOYMENT 
Books are the windows through which the soul looks out. 
—Henry Warp BEECHER. 
SECTION I 
THREE LEVELS OF READING 
“STUDY” READING: . READING FOR BASAL INFORMATION 
Many of the discussions in this book have dealt with “study” 
as contrasted with “reading” in the broader sense. Textbooks 
present to us in concentrated form materials which we have to 
master, to be able to reproduce upon demand, and to use directly 
in specific tasks of our own. On the basis of the information 
mastered from textbooks we proceed to various classroom experi- 
ments in the use of the facts, data, and information thus secured. 
Obviously the “study” reading of such primary books is intensive, 
painstaking, detailed consideration of their contents. Study has 
in view the mastering of certain definite and limited information ; 
reading is the somewhat easier perusal of books for the sake of 
pleasure or general enlightenment.                “SUPPLEMENTARY” READING: READING FOR ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION 
   
    
      
           Along with our perusal of textbooks, especially in history, 
social sciences, and English, we have frequent occasion in school 
life to perform a second type of reading which we call “supple- 
mentary.” Here, too, as in “study” reading, our major purpose 
is to lay hold upon additional information within the subjects 
upon which our textbooks have given us a beginning. 
297
-P-A-G-E-298
  298 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
‘We may distinguish between these two levels of reading in 
adult life by noting, for example, the case of a physician. Say 
that a new authoritative book appears in the field of his specialty. 
de studies that book in minutest detail. Or, planning for a 
puzzling case which he has to diagnose and treat, he reads care- 
fully a few selected passages from the authoritative writings 
upon the subject. This is “study” reading in adult life. From 
month to month the same physician finds in his medical journals 
articles written by various men upon subjects more or less closely 
related to his own field of practice. Through such articles he 
looks with interest, to find what other men are thinking and with 
what they are experimenting. He “keeps up” as we say, with the 
thinking in his subject, alert to be informed, resolved to be intelli- 
gent along his line. This is “supplementary” reading in adult 
life. In contrast with “study” reading, which is deliberate and 
intensive application to books, “supplementary” reading is fluent 
and extensive application; it is survey reading with only an 
oecasional intensive attention to especially significant parts. 
“RECREATIONAL” OR “CULTURAL” READING: READING FOR 
ENJOYMENT 
Both “study” and “supplementary” reading may be character- 
ized as work habits looking for immediate and definite results in 
the realm of information or knowledge. They are the business or 
professional aspects of reading skill. There is a third level of 
reading whose purpose and whose essential skills are of a some- 
what different order. Work is only a part of life; work may be 
called the bread and butter and the meat and vegetables of life; 
while pleasure, enjoyment, recreation are the desserts of life. The 
profitable employment of time in becoming acquainted with the 
rich possessions of our civilization is the other aspect of life 
contrasted with work. Here belongs a third level of reading, 
which for want of a better word, we may call “cultural” reading, 
or reading for enjoyment or enrichment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  THREE LEVELS OF READING 299 
As this chapter is to deal only with this third level of reading, 
we may consider certain aspects of it by way of preliminaries. 
First, “recreational” reading usually involves a kind of reading 
materials different from those of “study” or “supplementary” 
reading. In general, the two latter are said to cover the litera- 
ture of knowledge, that is, books whose main content consists of 
a body of facts significant and important for the work and busi- 
ness activities of life. History, science, engineering, home-mak- 
ing, politics, statesmanship—all the major interests of man’s 
active life in society, interpreted in myriad ways, and from 
innumerable angles—constitute the literature of knowledge. 
In contrast, “cultural” reading has to do with the literature of 
power. In this distinction between literature of knowledge and 
literature of power, De Quincey, whose statement we have bor- 
rowed, has in mind a meaning for the word “power” much 
broader than the meaning used in ordinary discourse. He does 
not mean power either generated or generating for commercial 
purposes. He means the writings of men of deep insight and 
keen vision, not merely into the facts of life, but into the mean- 
ing of life; the writings of men and women who do not so much 
attempt to teach external facts as to interpret internal mean- 
ings. Looking upon the larger aspects of virtue, wickedness, 
aspirations, despair, brotherhood, service—the characteristics of 
personal and social relationships of the larger sort—such authors 
portray the permanent significance of the facts of life about 
which they write. It may be better to say that they deal with 
the spiritual rather than the material aspects of life and that 
their major purpose is the portrayal of these larger facts. Some- 
one has said that a poet does not look at an object; instead, he 
looks into it. 
In speaking of the materials which are to be used for cultural 
reading, we must not limit consideration merely to the content 
of such books. Another element must be added, namely, the 
form, the style, the literary artistry. Obviously, the duty of a
-P-A-G-E-300
    300 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
man who writes a textbook in history, or a magazine article on 
a problem of the day, is to give his readers a clear, well-organized 
explanation for their understanding. But one who is attempting 
to convey to others the charm of a violet, the sanctity of human 
sacrifice, the majesty of mountains, the terror of a storm, or the 
calm beauty of an April morning, needs to present the facts of 
his theme in form which is in keeping with the sentiment he 
desires to portray. We say that his writings have “style.” He 
says what he means in a manner which is appropriate to and 
consistent with that meaning. His very words, sentence rhythm, 
harmony of sound, and the like are in keeping with the interpre- 
tation of life which he desires to represent. In this class of 
literature as such, of belles lettres the French call it, lies the 
realm of purely cultural reading. 
A moment’s thought will show that the three types of reading 
discussed above are by no means always clearly and sharply 
separated from each other. The three terms, “study” reading, 
“supplementary” reading, and “cultural” reading, emphasize 
the reader’s differing purposes even more than they stress differ- 
ing reading materials. In fact, the same piece of literature upon 
occasion may very well belong to any of the three classifications. 
An English class may study a poem like “The Landing of the 
Pilgrims”; an American history class may use it as supple- 
mentary reading embodying the spirit of the Pilgrim Fathers; 
or one may come upon it as cultural reading while looking 
through a volume of American poetry. In each case the purpose 
of the readers is the important element in deciding to which type 
of reading experience “The Landing of the Pilgrims” belongs. 
While such overlapping is inevitable, we are concerned here 
with those purposes of the reader which render his reading 
experiences distinctly cultural. 
The selections of this chapter include the advice of several 
men upon the choice of books for leisure reading, and upon the 
reading habits to be sought for by the man or woman who desires

culture, who wishes to add to the refinement of his life by such 
means as literature affords. Your problem is to go through the 
selections and such supplementary reading as you ean to find 
and to ponder upon advice on these questions: 
(1) What books shall I choose to read? 
(2) What are the standards for judging good books? 
(3) What is good style in literature? 
(4) When shall I read for enjoyment? 
(5) How may I best read for enjoyment? 
(6) Is true culture learned or absorbed? 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
1. Discuss with illustrations from your own reading experiences the 
three types of reading. 
2. Name one book or article, explaining how you have approached 
it at different times with varying purposes. 
3. What current magazines can you name as presenting mainly 
materials for “cultural” reading; for “supplementary” reading?

A MAN AND HIS READING* 
Harry Emerson Fospick 
Something very significant has happened to a man when he 
realizes that in books the greatest souls of the world will come 
to call on him as though there were no one else on earth whom 
they had to call upon. 
“What do you read, my lord?” said Polonius, and Hamlet 
answered, “Words, words, words.” Many a modern victim of 
the invention of printing might say the same. With all the 
reading that is done, how few people know the experience which 
made Mrs. Browning say, “No man can be called friendless who 
has God and the companionship of good books.” 
Some books are our servants. They run errands for us. They 
are mental drudges. They bring us information; they tell us 
news; they keep us up to date; they equip us for our trade. But 
the great books are not our slaves; they are our masters; we sit 
at their feet to learn. ‘‘Look,” they say, and looking, we catch 
new visions of life’s significance. “Consider,” they say, and con- 
sidering, we are captured by a new truth, and our spiritual power 
is multiplied. A man’s life is made by the hours when great ideas 
lay hold upon him and except by way of living persons there is 
no channel down which great ideas come oftener into human 
lives than by way of books. Said Charles Kingsley, “Save a 
living man, nothing is so wonderful as a book.” 
Many people shrink with a kind of modest reticence from 
claiming the greatest books as their own. They think that the 
great books are for scholars and specialists, not for plain people.

Upon the contrary, the specialist has his library of learned 
messengers to run errands for him and for him alone, the engi- 
neer his books on engineering, the economist his books on eco- 
nomics, but the great books are for us all. They spring, not out 
of specialties, but out of the depths of the human heart. When 
Macbeth sins and his conscience faces remorse like a tide return- 
ing to a shore, we all know what that means; and whenever a 
great creative book strikes a deep note it is sure to be dealing 
with an elemental experience which is shared by us all. A sig- 
nificant day dawns in a man’s life when he says tu himself, “The 
supreme books of the world belong to me.” 
Most of the books we read are like the rain water that fell last 
night. It is a superficial matter and it soon runs off. But the 
literature of creative spiritual power is a whole sea—the accumu- 
lated spiritual gains of the ages—and to know it and love it, 
to go down beside it and dip into it, to feel its vast expanse, the 
currents that run through it and the tides that lift it, are among 
the choicest and most rewarding privileges that man can enjoy. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
1. Is Mr. Fosdick’s distinction between books as “slaves” and books 
as “masters” well made? Discuss, with examples. 
2. Do you think that universality of appeal is a fair test for the 
greatness of a book? Illustrate your answer by citing and discussing 
certain books. 
3. Interpret “The supreme books of the world belong to me.” 
4, Which of the books used this year in your English classes has 
the largest “creative spiritual power”? Explain. 
5. Write a substitute for the third sentence on this page, using 
instead of Macbeth one of Shakespeare’s other characters. 
6. Name the “great elemental experience” in each of five of Shake- 
speare’s plays.

Reading Suggestions 
1. The essay in Section III, written by one of America’s well-known 
literary men, is intended to leave with the reader a vivid impression of 
the many contacts with life that are possible through the reading of 
literature. You will find this point developed at the close of the essay. 
2. Before the climax of Mr. Bangs’s article and leading up to it by 
natural steps of increasing importance, are two other results of read- 
ing, each indicated by Roman numerals placed in the text. Yet each 
of the first divisions is so closely bound in meaning to the last that 
the essay has a fine unity. 
3. It would be strange if the average member of your class should 
find that he himself has first-hand acquaintance with many of the books 
and the writers named by Mr. Bangs. Many of them, however, you 
will recognize by name. Read the essay through in a leisurely way, as 
essays should be read. Pencil in hand, place after each book and author 
named by Mr. Bangs one of the Arabie numerals 1, 2, 3. 
1. Books or authors of whose work you have had a taste. 
2. Books and authors whose names are familiar to you. 
3. Books and authors unknown to you, concerning whom 
Mr. Bangs arouses your curiosity. 
4. During the course of a second reading, copy into three columns 
headed appropriately for 1, 2, 3, above, the names of all the books and 
authors named. 
I am sorry for many kinds of folk. I am sorry for the dis-

path of achievement. But when I find a man who has the means 
to build up a library in his own home, yet into whose home come 
only the most inconsequential of books, I don’t know whether I 
am sorry for him or not. If he be one of those self-made persons 
whose supreme satisfaction with results is their most salient char- 
acteristic, who sneer at the real booklover and refer even to the 
reader of a Sunday comie supplement as a bookworm, and who 
hold themselves superior to books and their makers, I do not 
pity him at all. He has earned his wage of ignorance, and is 
entitled to its increment of dross. But if on the other hand he 
is one of those upon whose mental horizon the Sun of Letters and 
the Stars of Song have not yet shone, and who grope in darkness 
not by preference but merely because they do not know that the 
light is there, then I am sorry for him. I would do all that lies 
in my power to lead him to the light, for what light there is, 
indeed, in a well-selected library! What joy of song is there! 
What glowing comradeships with the noblest minds of all time 
lie within the silent covers of our books! 
I think I have today a keener realization of the complete 
satisfaction of a library than ever before, for for three years I 
have been an exile from mine, and after much wandering have 
only just now returned to it. Coming back to my books was like 
returning to a home filled with old and devoted friends. It is 
true that when I first entered into their presence they all had 
their backs turned to me, but their welcome was none the less 
warm for that. And when I realized that on their backs they 
bore their title to my regard, it seemed to me that their seem- 
ingly ungracious posture was merely their tactful method of 
“presenting their cards” lest, perchance, in the pressure of other 
matters I had forgotten their names. I wish all men would be 
as considerate. But there they stood, faithfully keeping watch, 
ready as ever to serve the need of each and every mood, giving 
me so warm a welcome, in truth, that with Shakespeare I was 
almost inclined to ery: 
My library was dukedom large enough!

And who would wish a greater? Is not the kingdom of mind 
fairer than all the principalities of earth? I would not deny 
the value of acres. I am not at all sure that if I could be the 
Duke of Devonshire and myself at the same time I should decline 
the honor, but for the riches of the spirit I would seek rather the 
pages of Emerson than the greening reaches of Chatsworth, 
Eaton, or Blenheim. Warwickshire is beautiful, but lovely as are 
its meadows, its gardens, trees, and leafy lanes, it is lovelier still 
for the romance of Kenilworth and the poetry of the Avon. It 
is indeed through the inspiration of Shakespeare and of Scott 
that pilgrims are inducted into a greater appreciation of the 
delights thereof, just as the song of Wordsworth is the primary 
Ture that summons us to the sunny charms of Windermere and 
Rydal Mount. 
Bovée tells us—and, by the way, I wish somebody would tell 
me who Bovée was, and what he did besides writing sayings for 
books of quotations, for I find no reference to him in the cyclo- 
pedias or other works of the cyclopedic, and I doubt not that 
to greater ignoramuses than I he is as well known as Captain 
John Smith or Daisy Ashford— Bovée tells us that 
Books are embalméd minds, 
which is why I wish to know who he is or was, and where he may 
be addressed. I should like to drop him a postal and after paying 
my respects to his genius, tell him that real books are nothing of 
the sort. On the contrary, they are the vehicles by which the 
still living minds of dead men are carried on through the im- 
mortal years. They may be enshrined minds, or minds per- 
petuated, but their suggestion is not of death, but of life itself. 
Bulwer-Lytton has phrased it more happily and more truly in 
his lines:

He might have added a tribute to the unwavering quality of 
their devotion to our interest, for our books, unlike some of our 
less constant friends, do not despair of our reformation if, per- 
chance, heedless of their warnings, we sin and fall. They stand by 
faithfully, and though we fall seventy times seventy times, with 
persistent patience they again repeat their warnings, as if they 
knew that hopeless as we seem to be, there is yet hope for us.

If I were a doctor I should make books a part of the materia

need. Over the door of the library at Thebes were inscribed the 
words “Medicine for the Soul,” and Diodorus described books as 
“the medicine of the mind,” wherefore I do not claim to have 
originated the idea, unless perchance in some earlier incarnation 
it was my privilege to be either Diodorus, or the sagacious trus- 
tee of the Theban library who suggested the inscription. I do 
not know if this were so or not. If it were, I can only say that 
it made no impression upon me. But I can personally testify

out of a rich experience to the medicinal value of books. Many a 
time have I wakened in the deadly darkness of the night, gasping 
for breath, with an acute indigestion, and, feeling myself on the 
verge of dissolution, lit my lamp. And in the breathlessness of 
some great book, such for instance as Victor Hugo’s indictment 
of “Napoleon the Little,” I have as by some homeopathic magic 
found almost immediate cure of my own. A course of Mark 
Twain and Bernard Shaw is good for any man’s liver; and I 
cannot even estimate the number of occasions when, afflicted by 
insomnia, I have wrested sleep from the pages of books which 
I shall not name, all freighted with the anodyne of slumber. 
Literature contains the herbage of thought that cures. Whether 
used as anesthetic to soothe a distraught nerve, or as tonic to 
stir to action a sluggish circulation, books serve the purpose, and 
justify the assertion of the already quoted Bovée that “the worth 
of a book is a matter of expressed juices.”

But best of all the uses of a library are the contacts with great 
souls that having books always at hand makes possible. It has 
been said that man is judged by the company he keeps, and in 
nothing is this more clearly demonstrated than in the bookish 
companions one chooses for his constant friends. The right kind 
of man loves good company, and the nobler his choice the closer 
to nobility of soul does he himself come; and a well-selected 
library places all these great spirits within easy reach. Fielding 
has said that ‘‘we are as liable to be corrupted by books as by 
companions,” and that is true, but it is no more true than the 
more genial view that we are as likely to be elevated by books as 
by inspiring associations. I know of no surer index to a man’s 
character than the things that he laughs at, or the things that 
he reads. If I find a man whose shelves groan under the weight 
of books which he has to keep under lock and key for fear of 
their contaminating influence upon his children, I have a fairly

elear line as to his type, and the quality of his soul. If on the 
other hand I find him enriching his mind with constant drafts 
upon the treasures of song, or feeding his soul upon the spiritual 
meat of the great masters of letters, or delving deep into the 
veins of the mines of philosophy, he seems to me to have become 
a promising initiate into the goodly company of the immortals. 
At any rate, association with the immortals is good, and it is 
through the open doorways of our libraries that they either come 
to us, or give us access to themselves. 
At any time of the day or night I can follow the fortunes of 
Ulysses with no less a person than Homer himself for my guide. 
I can touch hands with all the gods of ‘high Olympus on the 
eachet of his guidance, and all the splendors of the court of 
Zeus I am privileged to look upon, not through my purely mortal 
eyes alone, but with the vision of one who is himself immortal. 
If I desire to consort with men of power and purpose in ancient 
times, I have only to walk a foot or two from my desk to find in 
Plutarch a guide, who will introduce me to as many of the 
Caesars as I care to know, will present me at the court of Pericles, 
where I may have revealed to me the glory that was Greece; who 
will gossip to me engagingly of Solon and Themistocles, take me 
to dine with Lucullus, and give me the pleasing sense of having 
visited the Forum, and listened at the Agora.t Time and space 
set no limit upon my associations, and though I dwell in a hemi- 
sphere they never knew, and in an age to theirs remote, Plato 
and Socrates through my books speak to me and pour their 
wisdom into my ears, while cynical old Diogenes with surprising 
agility leaps over seas and centuries to make me laugh. If I 
have need for song, Horace responds to my eall, day or night. 
Omar Khayyam leaves his vine, drops his jug, and deserts his 
“thou” for a moment to charm me with verses, while if I be 
depressed in spirit a mere tap at the door of their books will 
bring Epictetus, or the Emperor Marcus himself to minister 
to my need of cheer.

If I be ill in bed, unable to stir abroad, books will take me to

Marco Polo, or week-end in Peru with Pizarro while that gallant 
bandit loots the treasury of the Incas. With Froude I can visit 
the West Indies without even lifting my head from my pillow or 
putting on my slippers. With Caesar I can travel from Rome to 
Britain, and find my way enlivened with many a stirring little 
serap, and cross the Rubicon in the most invincible of company. 
With D’Artagnan, Porthos, Aramis, and the noble Athos, to 
whom my sleepless friend Dumas has introduced me, I can feed 
and sleep in fascinating roadside inns in France whenever the 
spirit moves. There is not a stone worth looking at in all of 
Venice that Ruskin will not pack into a small compass and for 
my delectation bring to my bedside, if I but open the cover of 
a book and let him out. Johnson and Boswell and I can go 
stamping through the Hebrides together if I am minded to sum- 
mon them to that end. With Byron I can go singing along the 
Mediterranean and swim the Hellespont with none of the in- 
conveniences of travel or dangers of the adventure, if so I choose 
to aecept his lordship’s standing invitation to participate at 
will in the enterprises he offers. Stevenson takes me with him 
on a joyous adventure with a donkey, or if I prefer conducts me 
through a Child’s Garden of Verses, to the everlasting rejuvena-

If I would sit upon the side lines of history, watching great 
events, observing epoch-making men at work at the very zenith 
of their fame, I can do it in a rocking-chair or swinging in a

of all time, from the fall of Jericho to the surgings to and from 
Ypres or Verdun, and not a hair of my head be imperiled. With 
Victor Hugo I ean stand with the Old Guard at Waterloo. With 
Tennyson I can shamble through the hell and welter of Bala-

A mere scrap of printed paper will carry me through shot and

elosing chapters first, the fall will precede the rise as if history 
were complacently willing to reverse herself to suit my pleasure. 
Nor ean any company exclude me if I have books. I can sit 
in with Ben Jonson at the, Mermaid Tavern, and delight my 
soul with his witty discourse, and if he becomes discursive and 
bores me, it is my privilege to shut him off at will by the mere 
closing of a pasteboard cover. I may consume endless quantities 
of chops and brew of pleasing sort at the Cheshire Cheese with 
the author of Rasselas, or in the more modest company of 
Oliver Goldsmith. I can go with Monte Cristo to his eavern of 
riches, or with Aladdin summon the genii to do my bidding. I 
ean sit alongside of Priscilla while John Alden makes love to 
her on behalf of his friend, without any uneasy sense of in- 
trusion. I can introduce myself to Stanley as, in the heart of 
Africa, he utters his famous, “Dr. Livingstone, I believe?” and 
run no risk of rebuff. Sir Walter Scott will read his own 
journals to me if I ask him, and on top of his pillar I can stand 
with Simeon Stylites without danger of falling off, and priv- 
ileged to come down whenever I choose. If my manners show 
signs of deterioration, having books, I can sit under Chesterfield 
while he delivers his fatherly injunctions as to the principles of 
deportment, or better still rub elbows with Colonel Newcome, 
who at my call never fails to answer, “Adsum !’”?

Dickens awaken me. Dante, Herrick, Shakespeare, Rossetti and 
Wordsworth sing to me. Cervantes and Swift and Addison and 
Steele and Montaigne are never too busy to pause awhile to chat

flashes of goodly humor. And why? 
Merely to repay me for the paltry gift of hospitality. Merely

somewhat on the same basis, of (1) all American authors of promi- 
nence, (2) all English authors of prominence. A class committee could

be sure that the principal of your school would be delighted to have 
the results of such a survey, neatly tabulated, placed in his hands.

FIRST STEPS IN ANALYSIS OF A BOOK* 
Epwin L. Sauman 
Reading Suggestions 
1. Mr. Shuman speaks of three major tests, Form, Content, and 
Spirit, as the criteria of the value of a book of literature, with suitable 
subordinate divisions of each major test. You have an opportunity to 
fix in mind the most important elements of literary criticism, to be- 
come possessed of an instrument by which you can measure anything 
you read. 
2. Reading directions: 
(a) Read the article slowly. 
(b) Read it a second time more rapidly, but dwelling on the 
most important parts. 
(c) Restate the formulas on page 317 in your own words. 
(d) Learn these by heart as the class finally rewords them on 
the board, after discussion. 
You can afford to spend two class periods in this process and one 
additional study period. 
Most books, like most people, are partly good and partly not 
so good as they might be; our estimate of them must depend 
upon the preponderance of the one quality or the other. In 
order to know the good art from the bad, we must take a book 
to pieces and look at its component parts and qualities, testing 
these by certain ideals that serve the intelligent critic as stand- 
ards of judgment. 
All criticism involves comparison. The man in the street uses

it—in a vague and useless form—when he asserts that Napoleon 
was a greater man than Shakespeare, or that Vanity Fair is a 
finer book than Boswell’s Life of Johnson. He is comparing 
things that are widely different; he might as well say that a 
sunset is more beautiful than a cathedral. This hazy inaccuracy 
of thought is the vital defect in the average untrained person’s 
eriticism, making it to be more often worthless than otherwise. 
We must get hold of more analytical and definite methods. Let 
us see what elements go to the making of literature of any kind, 
and learn to measure these separately as well as in combination. 
Strictly speaking, literature is limited to those writings that 
have beauty of some kind in them—that aim at artistic symmetry 
—that give esthetic pleasure or stir the nobler emotions of the 
reader. This definition includes only poetry and artistic prose, 
such as good fiction, dramas, essays, printed orations, and those 
works of biography, history, travel, etc., that can show any graces 
of style. 
Literature draws its materials from life and seeks to represent 
life, but the great author does his work by means of selection 
and illusion, not by wholesale photography. He picks out certain 
significant phases, characters, traits, emotions, events, or truths, 
from life, breathes on them with the breath of creative imagina- 
tion, and arranges them in a little world of their own, every part 
of which has artistic relations with every other part. This little 
world, when it comes to us in the form of a book, must create in 
us an illusion of life seen with our own eyes, and it must be 
judged—under its own laws—by its degree of beauty and sig- 
nificance. 
Behind every literary product lies an idea, a concept, which 
the author has tried to put into visible form. Under the spell of 
his words, the reader should feel and see this concept as clearly 
as he sees, framed in his own window, the outline of a cottage 
across the street. So it is fair to begin by asking: What was 
the author’s idea? What has he tried to do? For instance, 
what has Daniel Defoe tried to do in Robinson Crusoe? His
-P-A-G-E-316
    
316 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
idea was to depict the adventures and emotions of a likable man 
cast alone on a tropical island, and to do it so plausibly and 
vividly that the reader shall be fascinated by their human 
interest. 
Treading close upon the heels of the first question come three 
others: What degree of success has the author had in putting 
his idea into artistic form? Was his little world worth creating? 
How does the book rank with others of its kind? The answers 
to these queries are true literary criticism. 
One of the first steps toward analysis is to learn to distinguish 
between the author’s materials and his manner of presenting 
them—that is, between content and form. The author’s concept 
may be compared to a fine silk gown that exists, as yet, only in 
the imagination of the modiste. The theme or matter of the book 
corresponds to the bolt of goods out of which the garment is cut. 
The portion of the original piece of silk retained in the finished 
gown corresponds to the “content” of the book. The author’s 
grace of construction and of style may be likened to the beauty 
of the dress-pattern and the artistic workmanship of the seam- 
stress. If the finished garment, viewed as a whole, has perfect- 
fitting grace of line and harmony of color and ornament, it pos- 
sesses the vital artistic quality of unity. 
Thus the beauty of a book or a gown may lie partly in the 
original materials, partly in the way the portions are arranged 
and put together, and partly in the trimming or other orna- 
mentation that may be added in the process of creation. In so 
far as these added graces of workmanship can be distinguished 
from the “content,” they constitute “style.” 
But style in literature is merged in a deeper quality called 
spirit—the author’s attitude toward life, toward everything he 
touches. Sometimes the ordinary reader feels the lovability of 
a fine spirit in spite of defects of form, when the learned critics, 
whose rules it has eluded, cannot understand what has won the 
popular heart. It is this element in Dickens’s works that helps to 
make them great in spite of frequent artistic defects.

FIRST STEPS IN BOOK ANALYSIS 317 
Matter usually is more important than manner, the thing said 
than the way of saying it; but both are of vital value, and in 
poetry and some of the lighter forms of prose the form may 
count for more than the content. You read Poe’s “The Raven,” 
not for the wisdom it conveys, but for the music of its lines, or 
the mood it creates. You read Holmes’s Autocrat of the Break- 
fast Table, not for its thought so much as for its rippling humor 
and whimsical fancies. And you feel, do you not, that the spirit 
of the one is vastly different from that of the other? 
In order to tell why we approve or disapprove of a book, we 
must lay hold of certain ideals of form, content, and spirit, which 
have become established principles of literary art. These prin- 
ciples take on tangible form in the laws of grammar, rhetoric, 
logic, construction, esthetics, and truth in some of its larger 
aspects. Let us see if we can get at some of these underlying 
principles. 
When you have got fairly into or through a book, pause and 
see how it answers the test of these three questions: 
(1) Is its matter essentially true, well chosen, worth while? 
(2) Is its form pleasing and in conformity with the laws of 
literary art? 
(3) Is its spirit sincere, attractive, touched with any fine 
feelings? 
These compound questions may be subdivided into others that 
are more technical and definite, such as these: 
As to Content 
(1) Is the matter chosen by the author worth presenting in 
any form? 
(2) Does it interest you? Will it interest those for whom the 
book was intended ? 
(3) Has it been sifted and condensed, so as to exclude all that 
is irrelevant and therefore dull? 
(4) Is it in any way original, so that it gives a fresh fillip to 
your thinking?
-P-A-G-E-318
  
318 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
(5) If the book is a novel, do the characters represent human 
nature truly? Does the psychology of their acts ring true? Is 
there any new light on the workings of the human mind and 
heart? 
(6) Does the plot show unusual powers of invention? Is the 
action probable? Does the story hold you? 
_ (7) Has the author creative imagination? Does he conjure up 
living, unforgettable persons and pictures before the eye? Does 
he produce a sense of reality, of life, or complex life? 
As to Form 
(1) Has the writing a live man in it? Is it illumined by 
fancy, by freshness of imagery, by wit, humor, piquancy of 
phrase? (Style.) 
(2) Are the materials presented in artistic order and sequence, 
according to the laws of beauty? (EHstheties.) 
(3) Is the language correct? Are the sentences and parts of 
speech all right? (Grammar.) 
(4) Is the diction graceful, clear, forceful, free of empty 
splurge? (Rhetoric.) 
(5) Is the argument valid and logical? Is there an adequate 
eause for every effect? (Logic.) 
(6) If it is poetry, are the laws of versification observed ? 
(Prosody.) 
(7) Whether prose or verse, does it sound well when read 
aloud? (Verbal harmony.) 
(8) If it is fiction, are the events and ideals presented with 
proper narrative art, so as to keep you always interested in what 
is coming next, and producing in the end an impression of unity? 
(Construction. ) 
As to Spirit 
(1) Is the author putting his heart into his work, or merely 
maintaining a pose? 
(2) If sincere, does he show temperance, justice, and self- 
restraint in his appeal to your emotions? 
(3) If the book stirs you, does it do so by picturing life truly, 
or by sensational and melodramatic exaggerations?  
-P-A-G-E-319
  FIRST STEPS IN BOOK ANALYSIS 319 
(4) Is it suffused by a glow of sentiment that makes you feel 
more kindly toward the people around you in real life? 
(5) Does the book reveal a magnetic or a repellant person- 
ality, a broad or bigoted philosophy, a religion of hope or des- 
pair, an attitude of selfishness or of sympathy? 
(6) Does the ultimate message of the book conform with the 
essential moral laws? Is its inmost spirit one of good-will to 
men? 
(7) Does the work leave a sense of completeness and satisfac- 
tion after you have finished it? 
These are some of the fundamental questions of all literary 
criticism, and any book may be tested by a majority of them. 
In so far as it measures up to the ideals thus indicated, it is 
true literature. 
Notice that the questions relating to form and content deal 
mainly with qualities in the book itself, looked at outside of 
ourselves; while those relating to spirit deal with the more 
elusive qualities, which we have to judge by their emotional 
effects on our inmost selves. The external or objective data, 
when we can get at them, are the more stable; but the subjective, 
when caught on the sensitive retina of a cultured soul, are the 
deeper and more searching. All three sets of questions are worth 
studying carefully, so that they may be applied almost instinc- 
tively to every book you read. 
Let us see, for instance, how George Eliot’s Romola stands up 
under such an inquisition. Is the matter all worth presenting? 
Yes, there is nothing trivial in Romola. But is it all interesting 
to the average intelligent novel-reader? No; it is somewhat 
overloaded with philosophical and historical matter that belongs 
to an antiquarian treatise rather than to a novel. But even this 
is original—in the sense that it has been dug out of “source- 
books.” How about the fitness of all the materials for producing 
an impression of unity? Well, there is no objection on that 
score—yet, wait a moment! I object to the highly romantic 
wanderings of Romola at the end. They are interesting, but not 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
    320 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
in harmony with the realistie spirit of the main tragedy. The 
imagination is vivid; the characters are alive, full of human 
nature, well drawn, even memorable; the action is interesting 
and full of dignity and meaning. Yes, the book holds me in 
spite of its dull pages. 
The questions as to grammar, rhetoric, logic, and the rest leave 
Romola almost unseratehed. The sequence of cause and effect is 
perfect. The psychology of the story is almost flawless, while the 
working of the moral law, as usual in George Eliot, is absolute. 
On the score of esthetics, the only charge we bring is a certain 
heaviness of manner, akin to that of the materials. There is 
some play of fancy, however, some humor, not a little piquancy 
of phrase, a great deal of sound thought, often expressed in 
happy epigrams. 
Is the spirit of Romola sincere? Absolutely. Throughout the 
book one can imagine the author saying: “Here I am not merely 
amusing myself; here, honestly and heartily admitted, you may 
find the things that life has taught me.” The emotional appeal 
is self-restrained and genuine. The author’s view of life is that 
of one who believes that the wages of sin is death, yet she believes 
equally that virtue has its sure reward. Her view of things is 
tonic, not cynical or gloomy. One feels behind the book a mag- 
netic, broad-minded, deeply conscientious personality. It leaves 
the sense of completeness and satisfaction, that testifies to a 
book’s unity and soundness of spirit. 
On the whole, then, Romola is a great novel—one which, in 
spite of its faults, one wouldn’t mind being condemned to read 
again. 
How many of the popular novels of the hour will stand the 
same test? Try it on the latest one you have read. 
When a person of uncultured taste walks through a picture 
gallery, it is the gayest-colored canvas that first attracts him— 
unless, indeed, he be like two boys of my acquaintance, who were 
found racing at breakneck speed through the room of choicest 
paintings at the World’s Columbian Exposition. When asked
-P-A-G-E-321
  
FIRST STEPS IN BOOK ANALYSIS 321 
the reason for their haste, they explained: “There’s nothin’ here 
but pictures; we’re goin’ to Hagenbeck’s circus.” When the un- 
trained reader enters the enchanted land of letters, his natural 
taste—or lack of it—leads him, as it does the red Indian, straight 
to the more garish colors. He passes by the finely wrought novel 
of character to waste his time upon some crude and bloody 
melodrama. Or, to change the pronoun, she prefers some mawk- 
ish tale of sentimentality, in which the emotional coloring is as 
false and impossible as if it had been written on Old Sleuth’s 
recipe for action: “At least one thrill to every thousand words.” 
This poor stuff may be the best that a crude taste can enjoy, 
but its quality as art is shown plainly enough by the fact that it 
never lives long; it has no lasting attraction, even for those who 
are temporarily deceived by it. Jane Austen’s quiet novels, with 
never a loud word or a heightened heart-beat, live a century, 
while a thousand overcolored romances lapse into oblivion before 
our eyes. Beware of the author who habitually “frightens the 
evening sky into violent photolithographic tints.” If a woman 
dresses in crude and overemphasized colors you say she is “loud,” 
and you prefer the one whose gowns are of neutral and harmo- 
nious tints, revealing her refinement and elegance. Much the 
same test applies to novels. 
Here is one of Mrs. Humphrey Ward’s, say The Marriage of 
William Ashe. It is rather gray in its tones, a trifle cold, bur- 
dened somewhat with intellectual freight, but its art is chaste, 
its characters alive, its psychology sound, its action true and 
often beautiful. You do not like it? And you do like this story 
by Marie Corelli, in which an impossible figure, meant to repre- 
sent Christ come back to earth, rants in an impossible style over 
the defects of the modern church? Well, your preference is 
quite natural. The novel is one of the most crudely colored that 
ever got among the “best sellers.” Look at it again. Though it 
may be sincere in spirit, the style is inflated, the action melo- 
dramatic, the emotion frenzied, and the characters do not talk or 
act like real people. If Miss Corelli’s novels did one-half the  
-P-A-G-E-322
  329 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
violence to moral laws that they do to the laws of art, her 
readers would turn away in horror; which is only another way 
of saying that in England and America the average person’s 
moral standards are higher than his literary standards. 
Evil and good are as inseparable in life as a man and his 
shadow, and both must play their part in literature. There can 
be no picture and no story without some shadow in it, but we 
are justified in disliking a story in which all the characters are 
unpleasant, and in refusing to read one in which the whole 
world is painted black. This is simply another form of over- 
coloring, though good artists at times are guilty of it. A man 
like Ian Maclaren will dip into Scotch life and bring forth the 
gentle humor and pathos of Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush, with 
a noble doctor of the old school as a typical character; while 
Maxim Gorky will dip into Russian life and produce a hideous 
nightmare such as The Spy, portraying a human welter of cow- 
ardly, drunken, suspicious, wholly contemptible characters, an 
inferno of skulking deceivers and silly deceived, running to and 
fro in a dim, mephitic gloom of besotted ignorance. There are 
those who will tell you that Gorky’s The Spy is greater than 
Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush. Do not believe it. There must 
be beauty of content as well as of form. 
Literary beauty may take on an infinite variety of forms, 
ranging from the stately grandeur of great imaginative crea- 
tions, such as Dante’s Divine Comedy or Shakespeare’s King 
Lear, to the little flowers of fancy with which Stevenson and 
Howells decorate their essays. In our day the imaginative crea- 
tion of character—the portrayal of complex human nature in its 
relations with a complex society—so long as the humanity por- 
trayed is not wholly base and contemptible, is the author’s great- 
est achievement. To couple this creative power with the de- 
picting of a dramatic scene that thrills in the memory ever after- 
ward—this, too, is a doing of a genius. Pure love well portrayed 
also is eternally beautiful, fulfilling Charles Dudley Warner’s 
dictum that “literature must have in it something of the endur-

ing and the universal.” Wit, humor, and pathos always are 
legal tender, as are self-sacrifice, courage, the attainment of hap- 
piness through trial nobly endured. But it is only when such 
beautiful materials, thrown into relief against some of the darker 
aspects of life, are fused by a strong creative imagination into 
living characters and scenes, that we have the highest literary 
art. 
CLASS ACTIVITIES 
Problems 
1. Test your reading of Mr. Shuman’s essay by making a definition 
of your own for the term “literature,” without turning back, if possible. 
If you cannot, read the first four paragraphs carefully, close your book 
and write a definition of “literature.” 
2. A class exercise applying the standards to the one novel read last 
by the entire class. You may have to go back to George Eliot’s Silas 
Marner to find a book read by all. Reduce Shuman’s standards to three 
under Form, Content, Spirit, respectively, making nine tests, all told, 
that you apply to the novel chosen. 
3. Is Shuman’s distinction between moral standards and art stand- 
ards well taken? 
4. Somebody said of himself that he liked religion and flowers but 
he disliked theology and botany. How does Shuman’s discussion 
illustrate the point? 
5. As Shuman suggests, deliberately apply all the tests named on 
pages 317-319 to a recent popular best seller. Write out your judg- 
ments.

Reading Suggestions 
1. This selection by Mr. Mabie might well have been included in 
Chapter V. Turn back to that chapter; look through Section I, pages 
193 to 200. Have the central theme of that chapter clearly in mind 
before you read the present selection. Be ready to tell how it supports 
and develops the central theme of Chapter V. 
2. Pencil in hand, check very lightly margins opposite the parts of 
the text which indicate Mr. Mabie’s idea of culture as contrasted with 
mere learning. At the end of a second reading, test yourself by writing 
one paragraph, without notes and with book closed, on the topic: 
“The Nature of Reading for Culture.” 
There is a book in the British Museum which would have, for 
many people, a greater value than any other single volume in 
the world; it is a copy of Florio’s translation of Montaigne, and 
it bears Shakespeare’s autograph on a flyleaf. There are other 
books which must have had the same ownership; among them 
' were Holinshed’s Chronicles and North’s translation of Plutarch. 
Shakespeare would have laid posterity under still greater 
obligations, if that were possible, if in some autobiographic mood 
he had told us how he read these books; for never, surely, were 
books read with greater insight and with more complete absorp-

tion. Indeed, the fruits of this reading were so rich and ripe 
that the books from which their juices came seem but dry husks 
and shells in comparison. The reader drained the writer dry of 
every particle of suggestiveness, and then re-created the material 
in new and imperishable forms. The process of reproduction was 
individual, and is not to be shared by others; it was the expres- 
sion of that rare and inexplicable personal energy which we call 
genius; but the process of absorption may be shared by all who 
care to submit to the discipline which it involves. 
It is clear that Shakespeare read in such a way as to possess 
what he read; he not only remembered it, but he incorporated it 
into himself. No other kind of reading could have brought the 
East out of its grave, with its rich and languorous atmosphere 
steeping the senses in the charm of Cleopatra, or recalled the 
massive and powerfully organized life of Rome about the person 
of the great Caesar. Shakespeare read his books with such in- 
sight and imagination that they became part of himself; and so 
far as this process is concerned, the reader of today can follow 
in his steps. 
The majority of people have not learned this secret; they read 
for information or for refreshment; they do not read for enrich- 
ment. Feeding one’s nature at all the sources of life, browsing at 
will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought, do not bear the 
fruit of acquirement only; they put us into personal possession 
of the vitality, the truth, and the beauty about us. A man may 
know the plays of Shakespeare accurately as regards their order, 
form, construction, and language, and yet remain almost without 
knowledge of what Shakespeare was at heart, and of his sig- 
nificance in the history of the human soul. It is this deeper 
knowledge, however, which is essential for culture; for culture 
is such an appropriation of knowledge that it becomes a part 
of ourselves. It is no longer something added by the memory; 
it is something possessed by the soul. A pedant is formed by his 
memory; a man of culture is formed by the habit of meditation, 
and by the constant use of the imagination. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
An alert and curious man goes through the world taking note 
of all that passes under his eyes, and collects a great mass of 
information, which is in no sense incorporated into his own mind, 
but remains a definite territory outside his own nature, which 
he has annexed. A man of receptive mind and heart, on the 
other hand, meditating on what he sees, and getting at its mean- 
ing by the divining-rod of the imagination, discovers the law 
behind the phenomena, the truth behind the fact, the vital force 
which flows through all things, and gives them their significance. 
The first man gains information; the second gains culture. The 
pedant pours out an endless succession of facts with a monoto- 
nous uniformity of emphasis, and exhausts while he instructs; 
the man of culture gives us a few facts, luminous in their 
relation to one another, and freshens and stimulates by bringing 
us into contact with ideas and with life. 
To get at the heart of books we must live with and in them; 
we must make them our constant companions; we must turn 
them over and over in thought, slowly penetrating their inner- 
most meaning; and when we possess their thought we must work 
it into our own thought. The reading of a real book ought to be 
an event in one’s history; it ought to enlarge the vision, deepen 
the base of conviction, and add to the reader whatever knowledge, 
insight, beauty, and power it contains. 
A visitor was shown into Mr. Lowell’s room one evening not 
many years ago, and found him barricaded behind rows of open 
books; they covered the table and were spread out on the floor 
in an irregular but magic circle. “Still studying Dante?” said 
the intruder into the workshop of as true a man of culture as we 
have known on this continent. ‘Yes,’ was the prompt reply; 
“always studying Dante.” 
A man’s intellectual character is determined by what he habitu- 
ally thinks about. The mind cannot always be consciously 
directed to definite ends; it has hours of relaxation. There are 
many hours in the life of the most strenuous and arduous man 
when the mind goes its own way and thinks its own thoughts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  
MEDITATION AND IMAGINATION 327 
These times of relaxation, when the mind follows its own bent, 
are perhaps the most fruitful and significant periods in a rich 
and noble intellectual life. The real nature, the deeper instincts 
of the man, come out in these moments, as essential refinement 
and genuine breeding are revealed when the man is off guard 
and acts and speaks instinctively. It is possible to be mentally 
active and intellectually poor and sterile; to drive the mind 
along certain courses of work, but to have no deep life of thought 
behind these calculated activities. The life of the mind is rich 
and fruitful only when thought, released from specific tasks, 
flies at once to great themes as its natural objects of interest and 
love, its natural sources of refreshment and strength. Under all 
our definite activities there runs a stream of meditation; and the 
character of that meditation determines our wealth or our 
poverty, our productiveness or our sterility. 
This instinctive action of the mind, although largely uncon- 
scious, is by no means irresponsible; it may be directed and con- 
trolled; it may be turned, by such control, into a Pactolian 
stream, enriching us while we rest and ennobling us while we 
play. For the mind may be trained to meditate on great themes 
instead of giving itself up to idle reverie; when it is released 
from work it may concern itself with the highest things as readily 
as with those which are insignificant and paltry. Whoever can 
command his meditations in the streets, along the country roads, 
on the train, in the hours of relaxation, can enrich himself for 
all time without effort or fatigue; for it is as easy and restful to 
think about great things as about small ones. 
A certain lover of books made this discovery years ago, and 
has turned it to-account with great profit to himself. He thought 
he discovered in the faces of certain great writers a meditative 
quality full of repose and suggestive of a constant companionship 
with the highest themes. It seemed to him that these thinkers, 
who had done so much to liberate his own thought, must have 
  
_, 1Pactolian stream: Refers to the Pactolus, a river in ancient Lydia, famous for 
its golden sands.  
-P-A-G-E-328
    328 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
dwelt habitually with noble ideas; that in every leisure hour they 
must have turned instinctively to those deep things which con- 
cern most closely the life of men. 
The vast majority of men are so absorbed in dealing with mate- 
rial that they appear to be untouched by the general questions 
of life; but these general questions are the habitual concern of 
the men who think. In such men the mind, released from specific 
tasks, turns at once and by preference to these great themes, and 
by quiet meditation feeds and enriches the very soul of the 
thinker. And the quality of this meditation determines whether 
the nature shall be productive or sterile; whether a man shall be 
merely a logician, or a creative force in the world. Following 
this hint, this lover of books persistently trained himself, in his 
leisure hours, to think over the books he was reading; to medi- 
tate on particular passages, and, in the case of dramas and novels, 
to look at characters from different sides. It was not easy at 
first, and it was distinctively work; but it became instinctive at 
last, and consequently it became play. The stream of thought, 
once set in a given direction, flows now of its own gravitation; 
and reverie, instead of being idle and meaningless, has become 
rich and fruitful. If one subjects The Tempest, for in- 
stance, to this process, he soon learns it by heart; first he feels 
its beauty ; then he gets whatever definite information there is in 
it; as he reflects, its constructive unity grows clear to him, and he 
sees its quality as a-piece of art; and finally its rich and noble 
disclosure of the poet’s conception of life grows upon him until 
the play belongs to him almost as much as it belonged to Shake- 
speare. This process of meditation habitually brought to bear on 
one’s reading lays bare the very heart of the book in hand, and 
puts one in complete possession of it. 
This process of meditation, if it is to bear its richest fruit, 
must be accompanied by a constant play of the imagination, than 
which there is no faculty more readily cultivated or more con- 
stantly neglected. Some readers see only a flat surface as they 
read; others find the book a door into a real world, and forget
-P-A-G-E-329
  
MEDITATION AND IMAGINATION 329 
that they are dealing with a book. The real readers get beyond 
the book, into the life which it describes. They see the island 
in The Tempest; they hear the tumult of the storm; they mingle 
with the little company who, on that magical stage, reflect all 
the passions of men and are brought under the spell of the high- 
est powers of man’s spirit. 
It is a significant fact that in the lives of men of genius the 
reading of two or three books has often provoked an immediate 
and striking expansion of thought and power. Samuel Johnson, 
a clumsy boy in his father’s bookshop, searching for apples, came 
upon Petrarch, and was destined henceforth to be a man of let- 
ters. John Keats, apprenticed to an apothecary, read Spenser’s 
“Epithalamium” one golden afternoon in company with his 
friend Cowden Clark, and from that hour was a poet by the 
grace of God. In both cases the readers read with the imagina- 
tion, or their own natures would not have kindled with so sudden 
a flash. The torch is passed on to those only whose hands are 
outstretched to receive it. 
To read with the imagination, one must take time to let the 
figures perform in his own mind; he must see them with great 
distinctness and realize them with great definiteness. Benjamin 
Franklin tells us, in that Autobiography which was one of our 
earliest, and remains one of our most genuine pieces of writing, 
that when he discovered his need of a larger vocabulary, he took 
some of the tales which he found in an odd volume of the 
Spectator and turned them into verse; “and after a time, when 
I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again. 
I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, 
and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best 
order before I began to form the full sentences and complete the 
paper.” Such a patient recasting of material for the ends of 
verbal exactness and accuracy suggests ways in which the imagi- 
nation may deal with characters and scenes in order to stimulate 
and foster its own activity. It is well to recall at frequent inter- 
vals the story we read in some dramatist, poet, or novelist, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
330 READING FOR ENJOYMENT 
order that the imagination may set it before us again in all its 
rich vitality. It is well also as we read to insist on seeing the 
picture as well as the words. It is as easy to see the bloodless 
duke before the portrait of “My Last Duchess,” in Browning’s 
little masterpiece, to take in all the accessories and carry away 
with us a vivid and lasting impression, as it is to follow with the 
eye the succession of words. In this way we possess the poem, 
and make it serve the ends of culture.

which we considered in Chapter V. Attempt this study, the goal to be 
a presentation of your results before the class. 
2. There are two contrasted types of books, those which yield pri- 
marily the “nutriment of facts,” and those which yield mainly “nutri- 
ment for souls.” May not some books do both? See if you can name 
from your own reading one or more books of each type. Carefully 
find and formulate your data in this problem. 
3. Mr. Bangs gives several suggestions for reading projects (pages 
307 ff.). Your teacher will indicate which are most appropriate for 
exploration in any library. 
4. Read George Eliot’s Romola to see if you agree with Shuman in 
the tests he applies to that book (page 319). 
5. Try, as Shuman suggests, the tests as finally revised by your 
class on one of the “latest” novels. 
6. “On Humor in Literature,” by C. 8. Evans, The Bookman, Vol. 
51, page 648, traces the causes of laughter to the elements of fear, 
confusion, and curiosity, and names many books in which the element 
of humor can be traced. This is a good basis for group study. Read 
the article and propose plans to the class. 
7. Consider the difference between “poetry of mere talent,” “middling 
poetry,” and the “poetry of genius.” See John Burroughs, “What 
Makes a Poem,” The Bookman, Vol. 52, page 102. 
8. The reading experiences of Warren Harding, Howard Egbert, 
The Bookman, Vol. 52, page 128, “The Literary Side of the Presidential 
Candidates.” Contrast with Woodrow Wilson’s reading, The Bookman, 
Vol. 52, page 291. 
9. A basis for a study of Carl Sandburg’s poems. See “Carl Sand- 
burg, Human Being,” Walter Yust, The Bookman, Vol. 52, page 385. 
In an interview Sandburg tells how he writes his poems.

10. John Burroughs’s reading habits. See H. Z. West, “John Bur- 
roughs,” The Bookman, Vol. 49, page 389. 
11. A satire on new poetry. See Carolyn Wells, “On First Reading 
New Poetry,” The Bookman, Vol. 49, page 458; and Ellis P. Butler, 
“Getting Material,” The Bookman, Vol. 49, page 581. How many qual- 
ities of new poetry does Miss Wells attempt to illustrate? In this con- 
nection, you may care to examine Marguerite Wilkinson’s New Voices. 
Questions for Discussion 
1. “The idle rime has only the lilt of a few dancing words, or the 
sparkle of a few trifling fancies.” Is there then no place for “idle 
rimes”? If so, when, where, what? Name one. 
2. What line of work in your school do you consider the pivotal or 
positive study for yourself? May there be several in the curriculum 
for various students? Why? 
3. Are “pictorial reviews” of current events popular with movie 
audiences in your community? How popular are they as compared 
with other parts of the program? Why? 
4. You may know the term “a candy drunkard.” Did you personally 
ever go through a period of “reading intensity” when you devoured 
books of any sort? What broke you of the bad habit? How would 
you help a younger brother or sister out of that state, which is per- 
fectly natural for children from twelve to fifteen years of age? 
5. Does a boy. of fourteen or fifteen enjoy stories or plays like 
Booth Tarkington’s Penrod? It has been said that the predicaments 
of that “hero” do not especially appeal to boys of his age. If this is 
true, explain why. 
6. What outstanding books of “the concrete literature of fact”? have 
you used in your present school year? What magazines of the day 
seem to be most exclusively devoted to such materials? Which least?” 
7. “Bovée tells us that ‘Books are embalméd minds.’” (See Bangs, 
page 306.) Mr. Bangs disagrees. Who is right? Prepare your answer 
carefully. 
8. Apply any one of Shuman’s three sets of tests to a book of your 
choice. Prepare a written or oral discussion as your teacher directs. 
9. In what ways do you think the “Home Reading,” or “Outside
-P-A-G-E-333
  MEDITATION AND IMAGINATION 333 
Reading” of English classes may best be managed to secure the highest 
enjoyment or “the least distress” for the average English class? Let 
your discussion turn on choice of books, ways of assignments, methods 
of testing or checking. 
10. Can you recall from any of the selections in this chapter support 
for Mrs. Browning’s statement of good reading? 
‘When 
We gloriously forget ourselves, and plunge 
Soul-forward, headlong, into a book’s profound, 
Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth— 
Tis then we get the right good from a book. 
Quote a passage. 
11. What novel, not a schoolbook, may you choose as the standard 
“for your discriminating sense,’ as a yardstick by which to measure 
the value of current writing? What about the book made you choose 
it? Apply the standards of pages 317 ff. 
12. Asked to name the ten greatest novels, Edward Everett Hale 
chose Robinson Crusoe, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Jane Eyre, A Tale of Two 
Cities, The Arabian Nights, The Newcomes, Ivanhoe, Romola, Pride 
and Prejudice, The Three Guardsmen. Are you not surprised that you 
may have read all but two or three? Why not finish the list? Still 
better; the question, “What are the ten greatest novels?” was addressed 
to about fifty distinguished men and women. Those chosen were The 
Scarlet Letter, Les Miserables, Romola, Adam Bede, Ivanhoe, David 
Copperfield, Henry Esmond, Wilhelm Meister, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, On 
the Heights. Choose one you have not read for your home reading book. 
13. Would Emerson’s three rules of reading be appropriate for the 
average man or woman? “Never read a book that is not a year old. 
Never read any but famed books. Never read any but what you like.” 
14, Bacon said: “Some books are to be tasted, some to be swallowed, 
and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be 
read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few 
to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.” Is this in line 
with the discussions of the present chapter? With what author 
especially? With what part of his article? Give page reference and 
quotations. Several different portions of the chapter may serve admir- 
ably at this point. Use illustrations also from books you have read.

15. We are often urged not to read “such books as occupy the public 
mind.” ‘This advice would rigorously exclude “best sellers,” popular 
novels, and the like. Admitting that the issue is debatable, many people 
think that every person of taste and ability should read some of the 
“best sellers” of his day. The caution is sound so far as it warns 
against excessive devotion to light fiction, and complete neglect of more 
virile reading. What seems to you the right position? Why? 
16. Queries may be raised concerning even Ruskin’s advice “Avoid 
generally magazine and review literature.” Raise one such question; 
select data to support your judgment; carefully formulate a judgment; 
present it to the class, either orally or in writing as the teacher directs. 
Note that the word “generally” is significant in Ruskin’s sentence. 
Exercise: Book Reviews 
1. The New York Sun published a review of a certain biography 
written by a distinguished man. After the usual heading giving the 
author’s name, the publisher’s name, the number of volumes, etc., the 
review was in these words: “This work weighs four pounds.” What 
might you think of the value of the book from this review? What 
might you think of the competency of the reviewer? If your curiosity 
is aroused, read the article from which the anecdote is taken: W. G. 
Glasson, “Methods of Book Reviewing,” Library Journal, Vol. 37, 
pages 135-6. 
2. An interesting research problem might be developed for a group 
of your class on the basis of the article of Mr. Glasson cited above. 
Strong and weak characteristics of book reports are described in detail. 
Using the suggestions of the article as a basis, and supplementing the 
standards of good reviews by class discussion, arrive at a series of about 
ten items under the heading: What Constitutes a Good Book Review. 
Then, having the class divided into committees, with these tests study 
the book reviews in several different magazines. Each committee may 
present its findings in the class laboratory; ultimately your class may 
arrive, with concrete data, at a reliable conclusion about “Book Reviews 
in Several Current Magazines.”

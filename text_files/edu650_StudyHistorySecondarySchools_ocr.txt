THE STUDY OF HISTORY IN 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Tis Committee was appointed by the Council 
of the American Historical Association at the 
Madison meeting in 1907. As originally consti- 
tuted the Committee included, besides the four 
members signing this Report, Mr. Charles W. Mann, 
Professor of History in Lewis Institute, Chicago. 
Mr. Mann died in the spring of 1909. He had 
been much interested in the work of the Committee 
and as a practical school-man had paid careful 
attention to the problems to be solved. We take 
this opportunity to express our sorrow for the 
loss of a wise and successful teacher and our appre- 
ciation of the value of his counsel. 
I. Relation of this Committee to the 
Committee of Seven 
Although two of the members of this Committee 
were also members of the Committee of Seven, we 
make no pretence of representing the earlier Com- 
mittee or of attempting to give an authoritative 
B I

    2 The Former Committee 
interpretation of its Report. We have made a 
new study of the conditions in the schools, and have 
entered once again into a careful consideration of 
‘the history curriculum. ‘The Report of the Com- 
mittee of Seven, however, has necessarily been our 
starting-point; we were appointed to determine 
what modifications, if any, were needed in the 
recommendations of the earlier Committee. This 
task could not be performed without interpreting 
the Report; and in some instances interpretation 
or emphasis appeared more desirable than any 
very distinct modification. In the following pages, 
therefore, we present, not only our own recom- 
mendations for change, but also what appears to 
us to be the proper or the most helpful and useful 
construction of the work of the Committee of Seven. 
II. The Report of the Committee of 
Seven 
In 1899, when the Committee of Seven published 
its Report, the schools were ready for decided 
change in the curriculum and for advance in meth- 
ods. The Report appears to have judged the gen- 
eral situation correctly, and, in the main, to have 
recommended steps that the schools were prepared 
to take. From one side of the continent to the 
other courses were fashioned with deference to  
-P-A-G-E-9
Uniformity 3 
its recommendations. The Report of the Com- 
mittee affected not merely the curriculum but 
also the method and even the aims of history teach- 
ing, and its natural result was also to bring about, 
or help to bring about, the establishment of sub- 
stantially similar curricula in a large portion of the 
schools the country over. In general this move- 
ment appears to us to have been wise and admirable. 
The approximate uniformity in the history curricula 
of the schools is in itself so desirable that the con- 
dition ought not to be disturbed except for strong 
reasons or where there is good ground for expecta- 
tion that a large percentage of the schools can easily 
and willingly accommodate themselves to the 
change. Not that absolute conformity to a fixed 
régime is in all cases wise; local conditions or pe- 
culiar circumstances may justly have more influence 
on the shaping of a curriculum than any theory 
of adjustment or of correlation of studies. But 
there is such a thing as a logically developed series 
of history courses, and there are general principles 
that are largely applicable to the great majority 
of schools; such principles may in special cases 
need modification; but they need not be en- 
tirely ignored. It is probably unnecessary to prove 
to the practical teacher the convenience of sub- 
stantially similar courses in the high schools, 
especially if college entrance requirements are,
-P-A-G-E-10
4 Present Situation 
or can be brought to be, in accord with what the 
schools are prepared to furnish. 
In light of all these facts we have felt it pecul- 
iarly advisable to look into present conditions 
carefully and to recommend only such change as 
appeared indubitably advantageous and clearly 
in the line of progress. Fortunately no very rad- 
ical alteration in the curriculum appears necessary.’ 
III. The Present Situation 
The present Committee was appointed by the 
American Historical Association as the result of 
a petition from the Headmasters’ Association pro- 
posing that certain changes be made in the Report 
of the Committee of Seven. The petition asked 
for a modification in the extent of the field of 
ancient history and for a reduction of what was 
thought to be an over-emphasis upon the desira- 
1 The Committee of Seven recommended four fields of history, 
each normally a year’s work, to be taken in the following order : — 
1. Ancient History, with special reference to Greek and Roman 
history, but including also a short introductory study of the more 
ancient nations. This period should also embrace the early 
_ Middle Ages, and should close with the establishment of the Holy 
Roman Empire (800) or with the death of Charlemagne (814) 
or with the Treaty of Verdun (843). 
2. Medieval and Modern European History, from the close 
of the first period to the present time. 
3. English History. 
4. American History and Civil Government.   
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  Present Course 5 
bility of cultivating the reasoning faculty rather 
than “‘mere memory ” by historical study. Before 
taking action on these matters, it appeared to us 
necessary to study the whole subject anew, to 
gather information concerning the existing sit- 
uation in the schools, and to make recommendations 
that the general survey of the field appeared to 
justify. We sent circulars of inquiry to history 
teachers in all sections of the country and obtained 
helpful information from the answers to these 
inquiries. We gained further knowledge from 
discussions in teachers’ meetings and associations. 
The general subject was discussed in the American 
Historical Association, in the New England History 
Teachers’ Association, in the North Central History 
Teachers’ Association, in the Association of History 
Teachers of the Middle States and Maryland, in a 
convention of the History Teachers of California, 
and in other gatherings as well. Some of the asso- 
ciations have made special and detailed study of 
the problems we have had to consider, and the 
published reports of these associations have been 
serviceable in enabling us to appreciate the prevail- 
ing sentiment on critical questions and to estimate 
differences of opinion and judgment. The recom- 
mendations in the following pages, therefore, are 
based on information gained from a variety of 
sources.
-P-A-G-E-12
    6 Present Situation 
To give in detail or in synoptical form all the in- 
formation gathered from the replies to the ques- 
tions in the Committee’s circular appears to be 
unnecessary; but it may be well to give here a 
brief survey of the general situation as disclosed by 
these replies and by the debates and reports to 
which we have just referred. 
(1) Ten years ago there were some sharp criti- 
cisms of the Committee of Seven’s Report because 
it ventured to mark out a course in history extend- 
ing over four years. But even then an occasional 
school was offering a similar amount of work, and 
since that time the development of the school cur- 
riculum has shown that four years of work can be 
quite generally offered. For example, out of 93 
schools which, in reply to our inquiry, describe 
or name their history courses, 7 offer five years of 
work, 38 offer four years, 2 offer three and a half 
years, 42 offer three years, and 4 offer two years. 
It is thus apparent that four years of work is a 
possible amount. Although a sound three-year 
course may be recommended to schools desiring 
to do only three years’ work, it is equally desirable 
to prepare a four-year scheme for schools that can 
furnish the longer schedule. This Committee 
believes, as did the Committee of Seven, that four 
years are needed and should be offered where 
conditions permit
-P-A-G-E-13
Ancient History 7 
(2) It is not so easy as it might at first appear 
to ascertain just how far the school curricula have 
been shaped in accordance with the Report of the 
Committee of Seven. But it is not necessary to 
know by exact measurement the influence of the 
Report; it is sufficient to know that, whether the 
Report has been consciously followed or not, school 
programmes are now very commonly, though by 
no means universally, in accord with its recommen- 
dations. Moreover, even when there are varia- 
tions in other particulars, many schools, we judge 
the vast majority, have abandoned the attempt 
to cover general history in a single year and have 
adopted the plan of offering blocks or periods of 
history. This alone constitutes an important ap- 
proach to the scheme of the Committee of Seven. 
(3) It is not possible to determine from the replies 
to our circular alone just what is the opinion of 
teachers concerning the field of ancient history. 
The conditions and difficulties are not the same 
in all sections of the country, probably. The 
1For example, in answer to the question, ‘‘How far has this 
course [of yours] been drawn up or shaped in accordance with 
the recommendations of the Committee of Seven?” one school 
says, “Not at all”; but the course given is, nevertheless : — 
First year — Ancient History to 800 A.D. 
Second year — 800 to the present time. 
Third year — English History. 
Fourth year — American History and Civics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 Present Situation 
teacher in the East, preparing pupils for college 
examinations in ancient history, works under con- 
ditions differing in some particulars from those in 
which the Western teacher is placed; to omit 
portions of a text, to emphasize, to enlarge or to 
abbreviate as inclination suggests or as need of 
time demands, is a more serious operation for the 
teacher of history fitting pupils for examinations 
than it is to one whose pupils enter college on cer- 
tificates stating that they have covered the field 
required. The difficulty in the Eastern schools is 
not so much in the extent of the field to be covered 
as in the need of covering it all with a layer of equal 
and even thickness lest the unwary pupil be caught 
by an unexpected question of the examiner. Incon- 
clusive as the replies to our circulars are, the infor- 
mation they give is mot seriously at variance with 
that reached by other methods of inquiry; some 
of them contain the expected complaint, but the 
statistics appear to point to the conclusion that 
the majority of teachers are not discontented with 
the length of the field. 
Of 107 schools giving adequate answers to the 
inquiries concerning the length of the period, 
77 appear to cover Oriental history and bring the 
study of ancient history down to 800 A.D., or try 
to do so; 9 stop at 476 A.D.; and 7 at some point 
in the fourth century. A number complain that
-P-A-G-E-15
  Government and History 9 
the field is too long, a few that the freshmen are 
too immature, and several that the text-books are 
unsatisfactory. 
(4) On the subject of medieval and modern 
history there are differences of opinion and practice. 
Amid all this diversity, however, one thing is quite 
apparent. Many schools—we are inclined to 
believe a distinct majority — are desirous of empha- 
sizing modern history. Certainly the tendency 
is too strong to be ignored. Here again one cannot 
form one’s opinion solely from the replies to our 
circulars; but as usual they bear out the conclu- 
sions one gains from other sources. Of the schools 
whose replies have been compiled, 7 do not offer 
work in the field of medizval or modern history ; 
14 do not state the limits of the field as they actually 
teach it; 67 aim to come down to the present day; 
11 do not attempt to do this; 64 schools are in 
favor of placing more emphasis on the later portion ; 
7 do not think such emphasis practicable; 26 give 
no opinion. Some 13 schools are in favor of a 
special course in modern history; and 28 wish to 
gain time for the study of modern history by short- 
ening the time given to medieval history. 
(5) Concerning the relation between United 
States history and civil government, and concern- 
ing the extent to which government can be taught 
in direct connection with history, there are also 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  10 Present Situation 
marked differences of opinion. There is evident 
difficulty to ascertain from the replies in the cir- 
cular just what the teachers desire. There are 
many possible grades between teaching govern- 
ment and history in two totally detached courses, 
on the one hand, and teaching them in one com- 
bined course, on the other; moreover, a combined 
course may appear the best if the time at disposal 
is short, and two interrelated and interdependent 
courses may appear desirable where more time is 
available. The questions in the circular were as 
follows: ‘‘To what extent does your study of Amer- 
ican history include civil government? Does your 
experience indicate that civil government can best 
be taught as a part of the work in American his- 
tory?” The following are typical answers : — 
“Our study of American history does include civil 
government, and our teachers of American history 
are emphatic in the opinion that for a secondary 
school the only feasible way in which to teach civil 
government is in connection with the American 
history. They heartily indorse the views of the 
Committee of Seven upon that point.” 
“About one-fifth civil government with a text- 
book. I have taught it in each way and prefer 
to make it a part of the work in American history.”’ 
“Our study of American history includes the 
study of political science. About two-fifths of the
-P-A-G-E-17
  Government and History II 
time is given up to this. Experience has indicated 
that it can best be taught in connection with the 
work in American history. The principal objection 
that we find to this plan is that it reduces the time 
for history.” 
“It should be taught in both ways — historically, 
as a part of history; systematically and logically, 
as a separate course.” 
“Without doubt civics can of itself best be taught 
—I say from experience — separately. In five 
months devoted to civics my class would have more 
knowledge of government than they have now, — 
but not so much of United States history.” 
“I am rather inclined to the view that an ade- 
quate course in civics may best be given after the 
student has had the history course.” 4 
The analysis appears to show that 41 schools 
favor teaching the two subjects together in a course 
that may be called American history and civil 
1 An experienced teacher, when asked how civil government 
was taught, replied: “In connection with American history.” 
“Do you set aside so many hours a week or a definite number of 
weeks in the year for government?” ‘‘No.” ‘“‘ How does the 
plan work?” ‘‘Splendidly.” “Do you use a _ text-book in 
government?” “Certainly.” “Do you believe this plan of 
teaching the two together to be the best?” ‘That depends on 
the teacher.” Possibly we have here the real situation; some 
teachers can without difficulty manage the system, others cannot. 
But schools should give opportunity to the teacher to teach in 
the way in which he finds he can produce best results. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  12 Present Situation 
government; 32 prefer separate courses; 23 partly 
follow the plan of teaching the two together; others 
are doubtful. 
Such replies and such information are, as we have 
said, inconclusive. But in light of all the facts 
we can gather we are justified, probably, in saying 
that there is an undoubted desire on the part of 
many teachers to have the opportunity to give a 
separate course in government, especially for the 
purpose of dwelling on certain phases of actual 
politics and government that cannot be readily 
and adequately discussed in connection with Ameri- 
can history. The need is not so much for a radical 
revision of method as for sufficient time to do both 
subjects profitably. 
(6) On the subject of memorizing and the attempt 
to get generalized knowledge, the circular asked 
the following question: “‘Does it seem to you that 
the Committee [of Seven] has laid undue stress upon 
comprehensive and generalized knowledge and led to 
the undue neglect of matters specific and detailed ?”’ 
The answers are clearly in favor of the Report; 
1r think that the Committee does lay too much 
stress on comprehensive and generalized knowledge ; 
66 do not think so; 19 are non-committal.! 
1Tn a series of recommendations addressed to the Committee 
of Five by the New England Teachers’ Association appears the 
following paragraph: “In general the critics of the recommen-

(7) The circular contained an inquiry upon school 
equipment for teaching history. Probably the 
schools receiving the circular were, on the whole, 
above the average in advantages and in general 
strength. However this may be, there is evidence 
that there is a wide use of illustrative material, an 
earnest desire to use as much as can profitably 
be used, and a sense of the value of sources as illus- 
trative material. 
IV. The Teacher and the Material for 
his Use 
The most important factor in the schoolroom 
is not the curriculum, the text, or even the method 
but the teacher. The schools are taking history 
more seriously than they did ten years ago, and 
superintendents and school trustees are beginning 
to see how difficult it is to get history taught as it 
should be taught. Of course it is a comparatively 
easy task to follow the winding way of a thoughtless 
pupil over the pages of a well-smoothed text-book. 
dation of the Committee of Seven complain of the length of the 
field covered, and to it attribute the apparent failure of the teacher 
of history to impress upon the student the value of facts, and do 
not feel that such a failure is due to the emphasis placed by the 
Report upon the value of generalized knowledge, but rather be- 
lieve it has been of especial value in leading our teachers of history 
to develop power in our pupils.”
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 Teacher and Material 
It is not difficult for a teacher to watch his charges 
narrowly as they move along from one rigid para- 
graph to the next. If the pupils ask no questions, 
the teacher is in no imminent danger of telling un- 
truths. But if history is to be a study of actual 
educational value and culture, if the boy and girl 
are to be given insight into social life, some real 
sense of time and movement, and, above all, inter- 
est, vital interest, in books and facts, the teacher 
must have character, enthusiasm, and knowledge. 
Because we believe so profoundly in the helpfulness 
of historical study, the necessity of bringing the 
pupils to see the world about them.as the product 
of past ages, the value of learning to handle books 
and to think andspeak clearly, — not alone of quan- 
tities in algebra or of facts in physics, but of human 
doings, — we wish here distinctly to state our belief 
that all questions of curriculum are comparatively 
insignificant. The schools have a right to demand 
teachers that are prepared to teach history and have 
the ability and the spirit to teach it right. Public 
schools, supported by taxation, that are content 
with the old idea that anybody can teach history, 
that anybody can trace the line of life through the 
past and give his pupils the spark of interest and 
the fire of useful knowledge, have, in our opinion, 
a distorted conception of their responsibility. The 
great demand of the day is for teachers that have
-P-A-G-E-21
  
School Equipment 15 
themselves inhaled the breath of enthusiasm, and 
that have knowledge, skill, and force. 
No one knows better than the members of the 
Committee how hard it is to have adequate knowl- 
edge and to combine with knowledge an unfailing 
supply of interest and courage. We know too that 
a great deal of good work is being done. But the 
fact remains that there is a need for more good 
teachers; the schools need far better equipment ; 
and the teachers need more time to prepare their les- 
sons, to seek out illustrative material, and to direct 
the study of their pupils. Excellent as: are the 
texts that have appeared in recent years, they cannot 
take the place of teachers well trained in history; 
the poorly equipped teacher may nullify the re- 
sults to be derived from the best texts. 
Most schools are badly in need of equipment for 
doing their work right. Teachers of history, when 
contrasted with the teachers of science, have been 
modest in their requests. In most schools the pro- 
vision for sound and substantial work in history 
is quite inadequate. Good wall maps, large, framed 
photographs of historical remains and _ historical 
places, a good working general library, a small , 
classroom library with duplicate copies of the 
most important works, lantern slides, which can 
if necessary be shown with an inexpensive and 
portable lantern, cheap pictures and reprints
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 Four Years’ Course 
of interesting sources for illustration and for special 
study, — these are necessities in a school that ex- 
pects the best results. The history teacher is as 
much entitled to helpful apparatus as the science 
teacher is to the expensive appliances of his labora- 
tory. In history, as in science, pupils must learn 
facts, and learn also to do things and see things for 
themselves; but if they are to get the best training, 
if they are to study history to the best advantage, 
they must have the tools with which to work and 
the opportunity to use the tools they have. A 
room devoted to history, a room well stocked with 
such materials as pupils can use and enjoy, will 
some day, and we hope soon, be considered as in- 
dispensable as the laboratory in the well-equipped 
school. 
V. The Four-year Course and the Three- 
year Course 
Ten or eleven years ago when the Committee of 
Seven was at work, circulars were widely distrib- 
uted and the returns carefully examined. At 
that time one-half of the schools answering the cir- 
culars reported a course in general history; 7.e. 
they sought to cover the field of universal history in 
six months or a year. The Committee of Seven 
in its Report strongly combated the idea that 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  General History 17 
pupils could profitably be carried over the whole 
field in a single year. Earnestly advocating the 
advisability of studying the whole period where 
possible, the Report recommended that four years 
be devoted to the subject and the whole field be 
divided into blocks or periods, each to be recognized 
as a unit for college entrance. Each block appeared 
to be brief enough to give ample opportunity for 
real history work, for a study of men and of con- 
crete facts. 
As we have shown in considering the replies to 
our circulars and in an attempt to state briefly 
what the general situation is, there has been a 
tendency to accept these recommendations. Blocks 
or periods of history not dissimilar to those marked 
out by the Committee of Seven are commonly used. 
We are at the present time, however, occasionally 
confronted with complaints and desires that are of 
exactly opposite character. Occasionally a teacher, 
more frequently, we believe, a superintendent not 
actually engaged in history teaching, advocates 
the retention or the reéstablishment of the short 
course in general history; on the other hand, one 
sometimes hears the declaration that it is impos- 
sible to cover the period of the world’s history in 
four years. The first complaint arises from a 
sense of the desirability of a comprehensive view 
of the whole field; the other, from an appreciation 
Cc
-P-A-G-E-24
18 Four Years’ Course 
of the difficulty of teaching well and wisely when the 
field is broad and long. 
It is not our intention to discuss anew the inad- 
visability of adopting the short course in general 
history; that matter is fully and, we believe, con- 
vincingly treated in the Report of the Committee 
of Seven. It is conceivable that some teachers, 
under advantageous conditions, with some students, 
may after a fashion cover the whole course of the 
world’s history in a single year; but it appears to 
us as a general thing altogether unwise to make the 
attempt. Such a conclusion appears unavoidable 
for many reasons, but chiefly for the reason that 
there are many things to be gained from historical 
study besides a comprehensive view and equally 
proportioned knowledge; and even if such a view 
and such knowledge could be secured by the study 
of general history in a single year, perspective and 
proportion would be acquired at the expense of 
what is much more valuable — training and insight 
and comprehension. 
That the fields marked out by the Committee of 
Seven are too extensive for four years’ study is, it 
appears, the belief of some teachers. At least we 
find one experienced and learned college teacher 
saying that the Committee of Seven ‘“‘unintention- 
ally perpetrated a pleasantry on the teaching 
world.” This pleasantry is said to consist in the
-P-A-G-E-25
Omission and Emphasis 19 
declaration that it is possible to cover the entire 
range of history from early Grecian times to the 
present day in four years. As a matter of fact the 
pleasantry might more justly be considered as an 
effort to persuade schools to give up the attempt 
to accomplish this task in a single year. ‘Teachers 
were advised by the Report to accept the four- 
period system, and, if only three years were avail- 
able, either to omit one of the periods entirely or to 
combine two of them into one. Objections to the 
plan of covering general history in four years are 
probably indications of progress, or, at all events, 
of a desire to give thorough work, to require or 
induce extensive reading, and to allow the free use 
of illustrative material. But whether these objec- 
tions are signs of progress or not, they appear to be 
ill-founded. More than four years cannot be used 
in the great majority of schools, and when so 
much time is devoted to history it is quite within 
the range of sense and possibility to cover general 
history and to teach the subject well. 
The trouble, if there be any, lies in the fact that 
teachers complaining of the inadequacy of a four 
years’ course in general history, or asserting that 
the blocks or periods marked out by the Committee 
of Seven are too long and cumbersome, try, or think 
they are expected to try, to cover the whole range 
of history with a layer of information of uniform
-P-A-G-E-26
  20 Four Years’ Course 
thickness. They do not understand that in going 
over a field they can, by wise omissions and clever 
condensations, here and there, gain the time and the 
chance to plough deeper in some portions than in 
others. No one can seriously propose that, in four 
years, pupils be taught everything that can be 
learned; and in our opinion stress to-day comes 
largely from text-books that are loaded with unnec- 
essary facts, from this feeling that omission and 
condensation are culpable, and perhaps, too, from 
such college entrance examinations as make it 
necessary to teach all that a text contains. When 
a school offers its pupils the opportunities of a 
four years’ history course, it does not appear neces- 
sary to omit treatment of any great period in the 
world’s history in order to get substantial results. 
But even with such a course the teacher must use 
discrimination, be ready to omit unnecessary and 
unedifying details, pass over unappetizing and 
unnourishing narrative, and emphasize and illus- 
trate the portions of the field that are specially 
worthy of study and thought. This process of 
omission and condensation, of emphasis and clari- 
fication, of dwelling with interest and sympathy 
on what most deserves interest and sympathy, is the 
process which tries the teacher’s soul, but it is the 
essential element of good teaching —if good teach- 
ing can justly be called a matter of method at all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
Treatment 21 
Unfortunately the schools do not by any means 
universally offer four years of history. There are 
many schools that offer but three years, and with 
this allotment of time many teachers must be con- 
tent. If only three years are available, how shall 
they be used? That is a question much more 
troublesome than the proper distribution of studies 
under the four-year scheme. There appears to 
be positively no agreement concerning what should 
be given or what omitted, although in general, 
probably, the problem is solved by the omission 
of a whole period or section of history, such as 
ancient or English, rather than by any system of 
condensation or combination. Of course the plan 
of merely omitting all consideration of some one 
block is the simplest, and in many instances it must 
be the wisest plan, for to attempt condensation or 
the rapid survey of a wide period cannot be profit- 
able if the teacher is inexperienced or if he has not 
the opportunity to make thorough and thoughtful 
preparation. ‘This is especially true because texts 
are not commonly arranged for the three years’ 
scheme. 
We are not ready, however, to assert that the 
course of the world’s history can in no case be cov- 
ered intelligently and effectively in three years, and 
that the only thing to do is to drop bodily out of 
sight some great and important section. The ex-
-P-A-G-E-28
  22 Three Years’ Course 
perienced teacher may find it quite possible to 
trace the main development and to gather the 
main lessons, and to accomplish the task without 
studying mere mechanical outlines on the one hand 
or struggling with philosophic generalizations on 
the other. This task must be performed by the 
wisest and most discriminating selection of the im- 
portant and by the skilful subordination of the un- 
essential; and it must be performed, too, without 
losing sight of the fact that the pupil must be so 
taught that he touches particulars. The second- 
ary pupil must deal with real facts and with real 
men, with institutions as men worked in them 
and with them; he must have time to think and 
read as well as to learn. We must not forget that 
history merits a place in the curriculum because 
of its distinctly educational value; by it the pupil 
learns how the toil and labor of the past gener- 
ations made the present; he learns to read and 
think of social problems. Such ends are not 
attained by any unreal and impersonal treatment 
of institutions and processes, or by the memoriz- 
ing of chronological outlines. 
It would be inappropriate to attempt here any 
ample illustration of the process of condensation 
and elimination that might be suitable for a three 
years’ course. ‘That process can be accomplished 
only by the skilful text-writer or by the wise teacher

in the classroom. We do suggest, however, that if 
it seems wise to omit any detailed study of ancient 
history and to give the three years substantially to 
the other three blocks, the teacher, while omitting 
all detail, may still attempt to give his pupils 
some idea of the growth of the ancient nations, and 
some idea of their achievements and their qualities. 
Hurried and unsatisfactory as such treatment 
must be, it need not be profitless; the pupil need 
not enter upon the study of medieval history with 
no appreciation of antiquity. The essentials of 
Greek civilization can be pointed out with con- 
siderable distinctness; the pupil can learn with 
some clearness the main steps by which Rome 
encircled the Mediterranean and established her 
far-reaching dominion ; he can get some knowledge 
of the most salient facts in Roman organization 
and government. For such study time must be 
gained by elimination and condensation, chiefly 
in the treatment of the thousand years of English 
and Continental history that come before the age 
of discovery. In many cases, probably, the teacher 
will have to give this introductory survey by oral 
instruction. 
If, in a three years’ course, ancient history be 
given as usual in the four-year curriculum, con- 
densation and elimination must of course be at- 
tempted in other fields. The medizval field must
-P-A-G-E-30
  24 Ancient History 
then be treated as only introductory to the later 
time, and only those facts can be dwelt upon that 
conspicuously aid in a comprehension of the modern 
era. If the second year’s work is general Euro- 
pean history, the teacher will seek to give a knowl- 
edge of the most striking facts in the development 
of England. If European history is omitted, 
English history should be so taught as to bring 
out the chief phases of the general European en- 
vironment. The omission of American history 
does not seem in any case to be advisable, and 
probably in no three-year schedule can the time 
allotted to it be materially shortened — its lessons 
are too immediate, its content is too valuable. 
And yet even here it may be quite possible to teach 
certain portions of colonial history in connection 
with English history, and thus to bring out the 
great fact of England’s expansion, as well as some 
of the essentials of her growth. 
VI. Ancient History 
The Committee of Seven recommended that an- 
cient history should be taken as one field of study. 
The schools were advised, instead of giving sepa- 
rate and detached courses in Greek and Roman 
history, to give a single course covering the history 
of both peoples. The Committee believed that
-P-A-G-E-31
Oriental Background 25 
the time had come when ancient history might 
‘be studied independently as an interesting, in- 
structive, and valuable part of the history of the 
human race,’”’ and not merely as a sort of appendix 
to the languages of Greece and Rome. There ap- 
peared to be abundant reason for treating the field 
as one field and not dividing it into two, as if the 
nations of antiquity lived and walked in isolated 
grandeur, and as if Greek history ended before 
Rome began. There appeared then, and there 
appears now, every reason for studying the history 
of the ancient world as one subject in schools, and 
the whole tendency of scholarly investigation is in 
the same direction. On this point, fortunately, 
there appears to be no material difference of opinion 
among competent teachers of history. 
As a means of securing this broader study of 
ancient history and placing Greek and Roman 
history in its proper setting, the Committee of 
Seven advocated a brief introductory survey of 
Oriental history, in order that students should not 
be dropped into Greek history without appreciation 
of the fact that thousands of years of recorded 
history had already passed over the world and made 
important contributions to its civilization. This 
survey was urged ‘‘as an indispensable background 
for the study of the classical peoples,” but it has 
not always been understood that it should be given 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 Ancient History 
only as a background, and ought in no case to in- 
volve a memorizing of dynasties or even a continu- 
ous narration. What such a course should contain 
is excellently stated by the Committee of Seven, 
and the present Committee sees no reason for 
modifying that recommendation: ‘It should aim to 
give (a) an idea of the remoteness of these Oriental 
beginnings, of the length and reach of recorded 
history; (6) a definite knowledge of the names, 
location, and chronological succession of the early 
Oriental nations; (c) the distinguishing features 
of their civilizations, as concretely as possible; (d) 
the recognizable lines of their influence on later 
times.” The statement of the Committee of 
Seven that this survey should not exceed one- 
eighth of the entire time devoted to ancient history 
has sometimes been interpreted as meaning that 
one-eighth of a year is a minimum, whereas in 
our opinion it should occupy ‘distinctly less than 
that amount of time. Fortunately the treatment of 
this field in the text-books has greatly improved 
since the Report of the Committee of Seven was 
written, and the better texts now offer a wise 
guidance in the selection and emphasis of facts 
concerning the Oriental period. 
As a further means of unifying ancient history 
and breaking down the traditional isolation of 
Greece and Rome, the Committee of Seven recom-
-P-A-G-E-33
  Constitutional History a 
mended emphasis upon the Hellenistic period, as 
the age when Greek civilization spread over the 
East and when Greece and Rome were drawn 
together, and upon the Roman Empire as the 
culmination of ancient history and the starting- 
point of later development. These recommen- 
dations in themselves seem to have met with 
little criticism, but there has been a -widespread 
complaint that they cannot be carried out in 
schools in the time available for the study of ancient 
history. The cup of Greek and Roman history 
was already full, and nothing could be added. In 
one sense the kernel of this objection is perfectly 
sound; what is needed is not so much more time 
for this course, as a radical revision of its subject- 
matter in the light of the progress of historical 
investigation and the results of classroom experi- 
ence. The content of the course is still too largely 
shaped by the tradition which made it the hand- 
maid to the study of certain classical authors and 
filled it with military and constitutional detail 
without regard to larger historical perspective; 
and too little attention has been paid to selecting 
and dwelling only on such facts as can be clearly 
apprehended by pupils at the age when the subject 
is usually studied. Thus for those who have as 
yet scarcely any acquaintance with their own gov- 
ernment, the attempt is made to teach the early
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 Ancient History 
  constitutional development of Athens and Rome, 
subjects which are obscure and diffcult even for 
maturer students and, at least in the case of Rome, 
are usually presented in accordance with outgrown 
views of historical study. We can see no useful 
purpose that is served at this stage by comparing 
the Solonian and Draconian legislation or learning 
the details of the Valerio-Horatian laws. 
Young pupils entering upon a new and compli- 
cated field of study should commonly be taught 
something of the statics of government before its 
dynamics receive much attention; the workings of a 
political system at a given period should precede 
the tracing of constitutional development. In 
_the study of Athenian history in the secondary 
school, the early development should be disregarded 
and effort concentrated upon the actual workings 
of Athenian democracy in the Periclean age. Like- 
wise in Roman history no attempt should be made 
to reconstruct the institutions of the regal period 
or the supposed history of the struggle between 
the orders. The teacher will do well if he leaves 
a clear understanding of the government of the 
republic in the period of the Punic wars, the char- 
acter of the provincial system, the constitutional 
issues of the later republic, the changes introduced 
by Augustus, and the nature of the later empire. 
Throughout the study of ancient history much
-P-A-G-E-35
  
The Limits © 29 
better results would be secured by fuller and more 
descriptive study of significant epochs, at the 
expense of much chronological narration once 
deemed important. Historically as well as ped- 
agogically, for example, it would be far better to 
begin the study of Roman history where our actual 
knowledge begins, at the close of the fourth century 
B.C., and give a brief account of the Romans, their 
lifeand government and how they conquered Italy, 
leaving for more advanced study the difficult prob- 
lems of the reconstruction of early Roman history 
from the legends and the guesses of the later 
Romans. By beginning at this point the natural 
connection with Greek history is made in the war 
with Pyrrhus, and the struggle with Carthage be- 
comes, what it should be, a piece of Mediterranean 
rather than of local Italian history. If it is 
thought desirable to give in the secondary school 
some of the legends of early Rome, they can be in- 
troduced here as illustrating the character and ideals 
of the Romans and their beliefs concerning Rome’s 
past. 
The suggestion of the Committee of Seven 
which has attracted the most attention is the one 
advising the continuation of ancient history down 
to 800 A.D. The reasons for this recommendation 
are apparently these: (1) such an arrangement 
shortens the period that follows; the great field
-P-A-G-E-36
30 Ancient History 
of medieval and modern history is made more 
manageable; (2) to break off the history of Rome 
abruptly at 476 or at any previous time is to leave 
the old impression that Rome actually fell and 
disappeared, while one of the most important facts 
in history is the continuing influence of the eternal 
city; (3) “to break off with the year 476 is to 
leave the pupil in a world of confusion — the 
invasions only begun, the church not fully organ- 
ized, the empire not fully, ‘fallen,’”’; (4) in the light 
of the way in which Roman history was not in- 
frequently taught,— as if with the daggers of 
Cassius and Brutus, or at best with the burial of 
Augustus or the unsaintly Tiberius, the greatness 
of Rome were gone, —it is especially desirable that 
connection be made between the history of Rome 
and the beginning of the Middle Ages, and that the 
tale should not be stopped without pointing to the 
appearance on the western horizon of states and 
systems which, in some measure, relying on the 
traditions of Roman order and the inheritance of 
her law, were to form the foundation not only of 
medieval but of modern Europe. 
These reasonings appear to us on the whole sound, 
and the great majority of schools seem to have 
accommodated themselves to this plan of prolonging 
the study of ancient history into the earlier Middle 
Ages. While, however, we find ourselves in accord
-P-A-G-E-37
The Limits 31 
with the Committee of Seven on this much-debated 
point, we believe that the matter requires further 
and more specific explanation. Many school- 
masters and examiners have interpreted this rec- 
ommendation as demanding as intensive a study 
of the period from Constantine to Charlemagne as 
is commonly given to the later republic and the 
early empire, and this misconception has naturally 
led to a protest against the possibility of crowding 
such an amount of additional matter into a year 
already full. The difficulty has been rendered 
acute in many schools through the practice of the 
College Entrance Examination Board of setting 
questions on the later period which could be an- 
swered only as the result of somewhat detailed 
study. Such an interpretation of the Committee’s 
recommendation seems to us not only out of har- 
mony with the spirit of its Report, but contrary to 
sound historical teaching, and we desire to set forth 
more fully our views on this subject. 
No period of history can properly be taught 
without some reference to what precedes and what 
follows; and no course on ancient history, however 
elementary, ought to omit some reference to the 
Middle Ages which came after, as well as to the 
Oriental nations which went before. If the Roman 
empire is in any sense the “‘great central fact in the 
history of nations,” the pupil must be led to under-
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 Ancient History 
stand its central position by seeing, not. only its 
origin, but its influence on later times.” He must 
be shown that Rome did not “fall” in any one 
year, but that by a process of change the ancient 
world gradually disappeared and a new medieval 
world took its place. To stop the study of ancient 
history in 180 or 395 or 476 is inevitably to give the 
impression that ancient history ends at this point 
and in some way stands apart from the subsequent 
history of the world. There is, on the other hand, 
nothing peculiarly sacred in the year 800. It is 
simply a convenient stopping place from which the 
student can look back and see by contrasting the 
empire of Charlemagne with that of Augustus 
something of the process by which the ancient world 
was transformed into the medieval. Some teachers 
may perhaps succeed in accomplishing the same 
end by stopping with the death of Justinian; others, 
especially where no specific study of medieval 
history is to follow, may wish to carry their classes 
still farther in the effort to establish a connection 
between ancient and modern times. The main 
point is that these transitional centuries should be 
used to round out the view of ancient history and 
show its relations to modern. 
Similarly in the study of medizval history it will 
be necessary to treat this same period, but from a 
different point of view, that of the origins of mediz- 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
Subjects 33 
val civilization. To chop European history in two 
at the year 800 is not much better than to chop 
it in two at 476, for the result is to violate historical 
continuity and give a factitious importance to a date 
which should serve merely as an historical con- 
venience. . 
The period between Constantine and Charle- 
magne, being neither wholly ancient nor wholly 
medizval, should accordingly be studied both in 
the course on ancient history and in that on 
medieval and modern history, but it should be ap- 
proached in each case from a different point of view. 
In the course on ancient history the emphasis should 
be put upon the Roman elements. In studying the 
later empire attention should be given to those 
elements which remained rather than to those 
which perished, — to the power and influence of 
the emperor as determining the persistence of 
the imperial ideal; to the Roman law; to the 
Latin language; and to the local life of the civitas 
and the villa. Christianity should be studied 
particularly in its relations to Rome as seen in its 
establishment as a state religion, its organization 
as modelled on the local organization of the 
empire, with the bishop as the centre of the reli- 
gious life of the civitas, and its absorption of the 
Roman culture which it was to transmit to the 
Middle Ages. The Germanic invasions should 
D 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  34. Ancient History 
likewise be taken up primarily in relation to the 
overthrow of the Roman empire; no attempt 
should be made to follow the migrations in detail, 
but the history of a single people, such as the Visi- 
goths, should be traced, and the growth and extent 
of the Frankish empire should be made clear as a 
basis for a description of conditions of western 
Europe under Charlemagne. Attention should 
carefully be called to the continuation of the empire 
in the East and to the part of the Greek empire in 
perpetuating Roman law and in civilizing eastern 
Europe, but its narrative history should not be 
carried beyond the time of Justinian. Such a 
tapering-off of Roman history cannot fail to leave 
a clear impression of the character and the abiding 
importance of ancient civilization. 
All such topics should of course be treated as 
simply and concretely as possible, and should 
require but a small number of exercises at the close 
of the year; and suitable questions upon these 
should find a place in examination papers on ancient 
history. Candidates might, for example, be asked 
to describe city life in the Roman empire; to show 
how Christianity was made the state religion; to 
give a brief account of the history of the Visigoths; 
to show how the eastern and western empires be- 
came separated; to explain what the Corpus Juris 
Civilis is and mention important states in which
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  Treatment 35 
its influence is still felt; to name the countries 
which speak a language derived from the Latin; 
to trace the boundaries of Justinian’s or Charle- 
magne’s empire as compared with that of Augustus’. 
On the other hand, such subjects as the rise and 
spread of Mohammedanism, the specific institutions 
of the Germans (such as the comitatus or the ordeal), 
monasticism, and the history of the Papacy, while 
they fall chronologically in the period before 800, 
are so essentially a part of medieval history that no 
examiner or board of examiners should put ques- 
tions upon them in a paper on ancient history. 
Topics such as these, whose culminating interest is 
reached in medieval times, are suitable material 
for questions in examinations in medieval and 
modern history. 
One other matter needs consideration here. 
Some teachers declare that pupils of the first year 
are too immature for ancient history. If, however, 
a four years’ course is to be given, what shall be 
done? Are they not in the same way unprepared 
for any field of history? Should the chronological 
order advised by the Committee of Seven be aban- 
doned and some other field given the first year? 
Now the only other field that one would think of is 
probably American history, and, as the Report 
points out, if American history were substituted, 
this would mean a repetition of courses usually
-P-A-G-E-42
  36 Ancient History 
given in the later years of the elementary school; 
the work could not be conducted on a plane suffi- 
ciently advanced to be justified. If American 
history were given the first year, it would probably 
involve the omission of the more advanced work in 
American history, and, it may be, of civil govern- 
ment, which high school pupils should have the 
chance to study in the latter part of the course.! 
If a three years’ course is given, of course the work 
might not be begun until the second year. 
The only possible solution appears to be one that 
is not on the whole regrettable. Ancient history 
must be made simpler and less abstract; more 
attention must be paid to the great men, less to the 
history of institutions; more time must be given 
to simple studies of art and habits of life; wars that 
mean nothing must be omitted, and time must be 
gained for easy, familiar talks and lessons about 
things that pupils of fourteen can understand. 
Constitutional details must give place to pictures 
and to stories of the great deeds and achievements of 
antiquity. An attempt to show just how this can 
be done would be out of place here. There is an 
undoubted demand for text-books that will aid the 
teachers in this difficult task; and there is need of 
1 Attention may be here called to the Report of the Committee 
of Eight of the American Historical Association, dealing with 
history in the elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-43
  College Examination ar 
abundant and cheap illustrative material. But 
the task must rest with the teacher. Difficult as 
it is, there is reason for thinking that it will be 
mastered. We feel confidence in saying that there 
is no other field of history so rich in materials of 
human interest and which can be made more vivid 
and comprehensible; but pupils will probably not 
be fired to enthusiasm by the reforms of Clisthenes, 
the duties of archons, the campaigns of the Sam- 
nite war, or the technicalities of the Roman con- 
stitution.! 
Such treatment as we suggest may not meet the 
requirements of entrance examinations, where col- 
leges demand a year’s work of such a character as 
may be done in the later years of the high school. 
But we cannot see our way to advising a distortion 
of the school course in general because of the exi- 
1 Reference may be made again to the remark in the Report 
of the Committee of Seven as to the fact that Casar’s Commen- 
taries, loaded down with all sorts of antiquarian information, is 
put into the hands of pupils in the second year of the high 
school. Boys of fifteen are often reading Xenophon. If a boy 
of fifteen can read Cesar in the original intelligently, can one of 
fourteen not understand a simple story of ancient life in the 
vernacular? Beyond all question the complaint concerning the 
difficulty of the ancient field arises from a feeling that the teacher 
must have his pupils learn things that are ill adapted to this 
stage of growth. This feeling is based on tradition and possibly 
on a difficulty of selecting the significant, the picturesque, and the 
comprehensible.

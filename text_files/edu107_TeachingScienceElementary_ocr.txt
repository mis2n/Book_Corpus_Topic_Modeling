  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tat we as a nation shall need to pay greater attention 
to instruction in science after the Great War than we did 
before it, now seems certain. The call for men trained along 
scientific lines for work in the fields and in the shops will 
inevitably be more insistent than any we have previously 
known. Research, too, along scientific lines seems certain 
to be cared for in a new way and to be greatly extended 
in scope. Our leaders now see clearly that if this nation 
is to hold its proper place in the life of the world it must 
become, to a much greater extent than ever before, a sci- 
entific nation. 
To become a scientific nation, however, just as to become 
an artistic, or a literary, or a moral, or a practical, or an 
economical nation, demands that the masses be trained in 
the elements of these things, for from the many the great 
leaders must be drawn. This involves not only good instruc- 
tion in the universities and secondary schools for those 
possessing special aptitudes, but general instruction in the 
elementary schools that the many may have any latent 
possibilities awakened, and may also be brought into sym- 
pathetic appreciation with the new turn it is desired that 
our national life should take. 
Science instruction, or the awakening during childhood 
of an intelligent interest in the world of nature which lies 
all about us, has an important educational as well as a 
practical value. To become trained to observe plant and 
animal life and the phenomena of the universe accurately 
and appreciatively is a great educational asset. How to give 
such instruction to children has long been one of the per-

  plexing problems faced by those charged with the responsi- 
bilities of school administration. One of the chief difficul- 
ties met with, especially in rural and village schools, has 
been that the teachers themselves, untrained along scien- 
tific lines, have not known what to do, how to do it, or 
where to get materials. The abundance of possibilities for 
instruction in scientific observation, the ease with which 
simple scientific experiments may be performed in the 
classroom, and the constant application of scientific truths 
to the daily life of all have been lost sight of in the feeling 
that only the most important things should be taught and 
that expensive apparatus and equipment are necessary to 
teach them. 
The author of the present volume in this series of text- 
books has tried, out of his long experience as a teacher of 
elementary science to children and to prospective teachers 
of children, to construct a simple and helpful volume for 
the teacher who is called upon to teach elementary science 
lessons, and yet has neither scientific training nor apparatus 
for the work. He has selected and graded the easiest and 
most interesting things to do in each of the main fields of 
science, has prefaced this by a brief discussion as to aims 
and methods, and has then supplemented it all by a de- 
tailed outline of what may be done, by years and by grades, 
by a teacher working alone and thrown upon her own 
resources. The volume should prove helpful to all teachers 
who are anxious to impart such instruction to their children, 
yet who need a suggestive guide which will show them the 
many possibilities lying within easy reach. That the work 
suggested and outlined has been carefully tested by the 
author, with children under actual school conditions, adds 
much to the value of the outlines and suggestions here 
presented.

PREFACE 
  Tur part that science plays in modern life is so vital that 
science teaching must inevitably have an important place 
in the school curriculum. There has been some confusion 
regarding the term to be used to cover the work in science 
in the elementary school. “Nature-study” has been the 
word in most common usage. But there is considerable 
misunderstanding as to what is included under this term. 
In recent years it has been used in an ever-broadening sense 
till now the word is used by many educators to include all 
phases of science adapted to the elementary school. But 
among people in general the common notion still prevails 
that nature-study includes only the study of wild plants 
and animals. So that, considering all sides of the matter, it 
has seemed better to the author to adopt the word “science ” 
instead of nature-study, as tending to involve less mis- 
understanding and as helping to establish an appropriate 
and standard term. 
The modifying words, “elementary,” or “introduction 
to,” seem superfluous. As we have history and English in 
the grades, so we have science; and it is just as unnecessary 
to speak of elementary science, or introduction to science, 
as it is to speak of elementary history or introduction to 
English. It is presupposed that any subject taught in the 
elementary school is to be adapted to the needs and capa- 
bilities of the children. 
It should be clearly understood that nature-study and 
science are not different subjects, but that they are two 
terms variously used to cover the same subject-matter. 
Three possibilities have presented themselves to the au-
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
thor: first, to devote the entire space to subject-matter 
alone; second, to devote the entire space to the teaching 
side alone; and third, to cover both fields. The last possi- 
bility seems out of the question because both phases can- 
not be adequately treated within the limits of a single text- 
book usually set by publishers. The first possibility was 
rejected because so many good books have appeared cover- 
ing nature topics. The author has accepted the second 
possibility as offering the greatest need at the present time 
and has devoted the entire book to methods of teaching 
science. 
The author has attempted to give a general view of the 
principles involved in teaching science, and has suggested 
the organization of a number of topics, leaving the details 
to be worked out by the teacher, either from other books 
or from her own experiences. 
Special thanks are due Miss Helen M. Reynolds, Principal 
of the Primary Department of the Mankato Training School, 
for help in preparing the outline for the primary grades.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
THE CONTENT AND PLACE OF SCIENCE 
Phases of science. There are four large phases of science 
in the elementary school: the biological, the agricultural, the 
physical, and the hygienic. Biological science is a term which 
the author uses in a somewhat limited sense to include the 
study of wild plants and animals. Agricultural science in- 
cludes some phases of elementary agriculture, centering 
chiefly around gardening and including some closely allied 
topics, such as weeds and soils. Physical science includes 
those phases of physics, chemistry, and astronomy which 
are adapted to the elementary schools. The hygiene phase 
of science includes the teaching of the laws of personal 
hygiene and public sanitation. 
Emphasis on phases. The emphasis to be placed on these 
phases depends upon the age of the child and upon his en- 
vironment. The biological phase receives special attention 
in the lower grades, diminishing in importance in the upper 
grades. The agricultural phase receives emphasis in the in- 
termediate and grammar grades. The physical phase has its 
beginnings in the intermediate grades and receives special 
attention in the grammar grades. Hygiene receives some 
attention through all the grades, beginning with the primary 
and increasing in importance in the later grades. By this it 
is not meant to imply that the health of the child in the 
primary grades demands less attention than in the later
-P-A-G-E-14

grades; but it means that more time can be given to the for- 
mal teaching of hygiene in the upper grades, because the 
age of the children makes it possible to give more considera- 
tion to the laws of hygiene and to the reasons for their ob- 
servance. In the lower grades little time need be given to 
formal lessons in hygiene, but emphasis should be placed on 
the formation of proper health habits. 
The distribution of these various phases of science accord- 
ing to grades is shown graphically in the accompanying 
diagram.

Child’s need of science. It is a fundamental principle of 
teaching that the child should be educated in terms of his 
environment. His daily life is to be the guide for the school. 
The underlying reason why the child needs science is because 
science plays such a vital part in his every-day life. This is 
a scientific age, when science dominates our life; and it will 
continue to dominate it with ever-increasing power in the 
future. In order that the child may play his part efficiently 
in this scientific environment, it is necessary that he should 
be educated regarding it in the schools. 
Wild plants and animals in the child’s environment. The 
child is closely surrounded on every side with a great variety 
of plant and animal forms, and these will continue to play an 
important part in all his life. They constitute one of the most 
evident and essential parts of his immediate environment. 
Some of these forms, such as birds and forests, are of great 
value to him. He should know this so as to protect them.
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE CONTENT AND PLACE OF SCIENCE 5 
Other forms, such as weeds and some insects, are injurious 
to him. He should know this so as to protect himself from 
them. Some of these plants and animals, such as birds, trees, 
and" flowers, are the chief factors that make outdoor life 
attractive. He should know these so that he may better 
appreciate this great source of enjoyment. 
Why we fail to appreciate the importance of science. The 
true value of nature knowledge in the child’s life is not fully 
appreciated because most people have had little of this train- 
ing, and so do not understand its value. It is only when 
one has once acquired it, and then imagines that he is to be 
deprived of it, that he appreciates its real value. If we wish 
to realize the true value of our railroads, let us imagine that 
we are to be deprived of their services for a short time; and 
yet people existed for thousands of years and made much 
progress without any railroads at all. So people have gone 
through our elementary schools without a study of nature, 
and hence do not appreciate how much it would have meant 
to them. Those persons who have acquired this knowledge 
are the ones best fitted to judge of its value; and the general 
consensus of testimony from these persons is that this ex- 
perience forms a vital part of their life, from which they 
could ill afford to part. This spirit has been well expressed 
by a writer in the Nature-Study Review as follows: — 
The love of nature aroused in that schoolroom under the guid- 
ance of a teacher who was herself a lover of the fields and woods, 
has given more pleasure than all else in life combined. 
Agriculture and the child’s life. The whole human race is 
indebted in the most intimate way possible to agriculture. 
To the country child it is his father’s vocation and he is living 
constantly in the midst of agricultural activities and remind- 
ers. They form a vital part of his life. They are also vital 
to the town child, only removed one step farther, so that
-P-A-G-E-16
    
6 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
the connection is not so plain. But even here are seen the 
elementary phases of agriculture in gardening, and the child 
may himself engage in its activities and derive profit and 
pleasure therefrom. 
Applications of modern science. For the great majority of 
those things that contribute to the comforts and necessities 
of the child’s daily life, he is indebted to modern means of 
travel. The locomotive, the electric trolley, and the auto- 
mobile are in constant use in carrying the child from place to 
place. But of even greater importance is the part they play 
in bringing into his home those things that he uses daily. 
The steamboat and locomotive bring the child food and cloth- 
ing from all parts of the world: fruits from Florida and Cali- 
fornia, rice from China, and silks from France. The loco- 
motive takes a letter from New York to San Francisco and 
brings back an answer, all within a fortnight. 
The water wheel, the motor, and the steam engine turn 
the wheels in the factories where the child’s clothing is 
woven and much of his food is prepared. They run the 
machines that saw the lumber out of which his home is con- 
structed; they turn the lathes and run the saws that make 
the tables and chairs used in his home. It is difficult to look 
anywhere that one does not find evidences of the part that 
these machines play in contributing to the child’s every-day 
conveniences. 
The telegraph and the telephone make it possible through 
the newspapers to keep informed of what is happening in all 
parts of the world, only a short time after these events occur. 
The telephone has come to be a daily necessity so closely 
interwoven with our every-day activities as to be considered 
almost as much an essential in a modern home as is a watch 
or clock. 
Many of the child’s chief pleasures are made _ possible 
through the applications of science. Probably no other one
-P-A-G-E-17
     THE CONTENT AND PLACE OF SCIENCE q 
thing furnishes enjoyment to so many people, children and 
adults alike, as the moving pictures. It has been estimated 
that fourteen million people visit the moving pictures every 
day in the United States. These pictures are made possible 
through improvements in photography and devices for pro- 
jecting pictures on the screen. The phonograph and the 
great variety of musical instruments, such as the piano and 
the violin, are applications of the physics of sound. 
These examples that have been given are applications of 
modern science in the child’s every-day life, and they con- 
stitute the chief reasons for the difference between life to-day 
and life a hundred years ago. These well-known illustrations 
have been cited to emphasize the fact that science plays a 
dominant part in the child’s life. Hence, as a natural result, 
the study of science should have an important place in the 
school curriculum. 
Hygiene and life. And finally, underlying everything else 
and more important than all else combined, is the conserva- 
tion of the child’s health. Teaching hygiene should form a 
vital part of the science work. The condition of the body 
underlies all that one does in life. The strong, healthy body 
gives the possibility of a long, useful, happy life. The weak 
body handicaps one in all walks in life in direct proportion 
to the extent of this weakness. Good health is the most 
precious thing tet the individual can possess, and the con- 
servation of this health should be the first consideration of 
the school. 
These statements are self-evident, and it would seem al- 
most needless to restate them, were it not for the lamentable 
fact that the laws of health are seriously violated by the in- 
dividual, and the teaching of these laws is almost criminally 
neglected by the public schools. Statistics show that the 
death-rate in this country for people over forty years of age 
is increasing. This means that people are failing to follow 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
the laws of hygiene in their living. This is largely a matter 
of habits, and correct hygienic habits of living should be 
established during the school age of the child. 
Quotations regarding the place of science. As evidence of 
the need of science teaching in our schools the two following 
quotations will suffice to indicate the opinion of educators 
who look at the school problem from a general viewpoint, 
and not merely from that of a specialist in science. Mr. 
Abraham Flexner, in his masterly and constructive paper 
entitled, A Modern School, writes regarding the science 
work: — 
The work in science should be the central and dominating 
feature of the school — a departure that is sound from the stand- 
point of psychology and necessary from the standpoint of our 
main purpose. Children would begin by getting acquainted with 
objects — animate and inanimate; they would learn to know trees, 
plants, animals, hills, streams, rocks, and to care for animals and 
plants. At the next stage, they would follow the life cycles of 
plants and animals, and study the processes to be observed in in- 
animate things. They would also begin experimentation — physi- 
cal, chemical and biological. In the upper grades, science would 
gradually assume more systematic form. On the basis of abundant 
sense-acquired knowledge and with senses sharpened by constant 
use, children would be interested in problems and in the theoretic 
basis on which their solution depends. They will make and under- 
stand a fireless cooker, a camera, a wireless telegraph; and they 
will ultimately deal with phenomena and their relation in the most 
rigorous scientific form. 
The Cleveland Survey volume on What the Schools Teach 
and Might Teach says: — 
No elaborate argument should be required to convince the au- 
thorities in charge of the school system of a modern city like Cleve- 
land that in this ultra-scientific age the children who do not go 
beyond the elementary school—and they constitute a majority — 
need to possess a working knowledge of the rudiments of science 
if they are to make their lives effective. Considered from the stand- ,
-P-A-G-E-19
THE CONTENT AND PLACE OF SCIENCE 9 
point of actual human needs, the present almost complete neglect 
of elementary science is indefensible. 
Science has long since passed beyond the stage of a fad, 
and is now a fundamental subject for the schools in the same 
sense that any subject is considered fundamental; that is, if 
the child has not had instruction in that subject, he has missed 
a vital part of his life, as a result of which he will be handi- 
capped in life; he cannot himself derive so much pleasure 
from it, he cannot be so successful, nor can he be of so much 
service to others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
CHAPTER II 
AIMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
Tue aims of any subject should be as broad as life itself, 
in so far as that subject touches the various phases of life. 
Science is so closely related to many vital aspects of human 
life that the aims of science teaching must be broad and 
comprehensive. 
In order to teach any subject effectively the teacher must 
have clearly in mind the purposes to be served by that sub- 
ject. This gives definiteness and directness to her teaching. 
In teaching science there is another special. reason why a 
clear understanding of aims is essential for the best results. 
The discussion of the previous chapter suggests the tre- 
mendously broad field that science covers. It is self-evident 
that only a small portion of this field can be studied. How 
shall the teacher know which portions to cover? A clear 
understanding of the purposes of teaching science will serve 
as a guide in selecting from this large field. Those topics will 
be selected which best help to serve those purposes. Those 
portions which help least, or not at all, will be omitted. 
Aims of education. In determining the aims of teaching 
science the fundamental consideration is the aim of educa- 
tion in general, as science is simply one subject in the school 
urriculum, and all subjects must codperate to a common 
ae The purposes of education have been stated in many 
forms by different writers. It is fairly inclusive to say that 
education has four large_aims:} the vocational, the avoca- 
tional, the social, and thé hygienic. The vocational aim seeks 
to teach the individual how to earn a living; the avocational 
seeks to show him how to occupy his leisure hours, so that he 
   
-P-A-G-E-21
  AIMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING il 
may derive greater pleasure in living; the social seeks to 
teach him his duties to his fellows; and the hygienic seeks to 
teach him how to conserve health. The vocational aim has 
no place in the elementary school, because the immaturity of 
the children does not permit a vocation to be taught. This 
leaves, therefore, a threefold aim for the elementary school 
— the avocational, the social, and the hygienic. 
Science, as one of the subjects in the school curriculum, 
can very clearly contribute its share toward fulfilling each 
of these aims. So that we may take these same aims as our 
guide in teaching science. It is convenient to consider also 
the economic aim, which is not so much an additional aim as 
it is a particular aspect of the other aims, which it seems best 
for our purposes to treat separately under this head. 
From still another more general standpoint, education has 
two great functions to perform: fto promote the welfare of 
the individual and that of society} Both of these aspects are 
included in these aims. The esthetic or avocational aim 
deals largely with individual welfare, the social aim with 
social welfare, and the hygienic and economic aims with both 
individual and social well-being. 
Zisthetic or avocational aim. One important aim of science 
teaching is to furnish greater pleasure in living| Enjoyment 
is an element necessary for the most successful living. Every 
one demands and seeks some form of enjoyment, and rightly 
so. Some of the pleasures thus obtained are positively harm- 
ful, some are worthless, and others are helpful. One purpose 
of teaching science is to furnish a helpful kind of enjoyment 
that shall make life more worth living. The study of na- 
ture furnishes many opportunities to derive such pleasure. 
Through all his life one is surrounded with a wonderful 
variety of beautiful plant and animal forms. People are real- 
izing to-day as never before the advantages of living out- 
doors in contact with nature. The enjoyment of life is
-P-A-G-E-22
  
12 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
greatly increased, oftentimes, perhaps unconsciously, if one 
knows the trees that help so much to make the landscapes 
beautiful, and can name the flowers that adorn the roadsides 
and gardens, and sees and hears the birds that gladden the 
spring-time by their beautiful colors and musical songs. 
The raising of flowers, vegetables, and fruits in the home 
garden is a source of much pleasure, as well as having 
economic and hygienic bearings, 
Young children derive great pleasure in keeping pets, and 
the care of these pets has the further advantage that it helps 
to develop in children a sense of responsibility. 
The pleasures that nature furnishes are of almost univer- 
sal application, in that nearly every one may derive some 
enjoyment therefrom, if attention is called in school to these 
possibilities and children are taught to know the common 
forms of life that everywhere surround them. No special 
training is needed to enjoy these pleasures, and they are free 
to all. 
The relative stress to be laid upon the various aims must 
evidently depend upon the age of the child. The esthetic 
aim should be the dominant one for young children, and 
should become relatively less important for the older chil- 
dren, but should, however, be kept in mind throughout all 
the grades. 
Economic aim. Somewhat in contrast with the esthetic 
aim stands the economic aim, dealing with practical affairs. 
In the great variety of wild life are found both beneficial 
and injurious forms, the former of which should be protected, 
and the latter destroyed or controlled. Among birds we 
find that the great majority are beneficial. Among insects 
are found some of man’s worst enemies. In the vegetable 
garden, in the fruit garden, among the field crops, and in 
the household are troublesome and dangerous pests which 
must be controlled. Some are even dangerous to human
-P-A-G-E-23
AIMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING 13 
life. On the other hand, there are many insects that are of 
great value to man. Weeds are another great pest wherever 
crops are raised. Every citizen needs to know something 
of the economic aspects of these numerous forms of life, in 
order that he may guide his actions more efficiently. 
Gardening has an economic aspect worthy of careful con- 
sideration. The constant upward trend in the cost of living 
presents a serious problem for the great majority of people. 
A garden, even though small, may be one factor in helping 
to reduce the cost of living, and at the same time it may 
furnish the most healthful kinds of foods. 
There are many applications of physical science, such as 
the telephone, the steam engine, and the automobile, which 
play so vital a part in modern life that some knowledge of 
their significance is essential to an intelligent existence amid 
present-day surroundings. 
The economic aim may be kept in mind to some extent 
in the intermediate grades, and may share with the social 
aim the dominant place in the grammar grades. 
Social aim. During recent years, the social aim of educa- 
tion has been strongly emphasized, and properly so. Man 
above all other forms of creation is a social being. As modern 
improvements and increase in population bring people 
closer together, both potentially and actually, and make 
them more dependent on each other, the duties that one 
owes to his fellows become of increasing importance. Co- 
operation, not competition, is the watchword of our advance 
to-day in all phases of activity — political, religious, and 
industrial, as well as educational. 
In the teaching of science there are opportunities to show 
children how they may best perform their social duties and 
codperate with others to promote the best welfare of all. 
Some forms of wild life, such as birds and forests, are of 
great value to the entire country, and should be protected
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
and preserved. During the years past the true value of birds 
and forests has not been appreciated, and these natural 
resources have been squandered even to the point of extinc- 
tion of some species, of which the passenger pigeon is a 
recent example. We may teach our boys and girls that 
preservation of birds and forests is one of the duties of 
citizenship, and that for this codperation is necessary. 
And most important of all is the protection of the health 
of the community. For this codperation is absolutely es- 
sential. As people are more and more gathering in towns 
and cities the necessity of working together becomes in- 
creasingly important. When a man lived on a farm far re- 
moved from neighbors many of his health problems were 
entirely personal, and concerned himself and family alone. 
But with the grouping of people in towns in close proximity 
many health problems must be solved in common, such as 
keeping the water supply pure, controlling contagious dis- 
eases, and disposing of garbage and sewage. 
Thousands of people are killed every year through the 
agency of the fly and the mosquito in carrying diseases, and 
yet practically all of these deaths are needless, because by 
proper codperation the citizens of a town can control these 
pests. The work in science may well be a means through 
which such an interest will be aroused in both children and 
parents, that efforts will be made which will lead to the con- 
trol of these insects. 
The wide extension of modern applications of science has 
done much to draw people of distant States together and to 
produce a feeling of unity and a greater toleration for others’ 
viewpoints. This has helped to make a people more homo- 
geneous in ideals and to produce a feeling of oneness that 
underlies a true national spirit. 
The social aim may find its beginnings in the intermediate 
grades as soon as the age of the children enables them to
-P-A-G-E-25
AIMS OF SCIENCE TEACHING ib) 
appreciate some of its phases, and should be one of the 
dominant aims of the grammar grades. 
Hygienic aim. The need of a healthy body as the basis of 
all activities of life is self-evident, as is also the need of teach- 
ing boys and girls how to keep their bodies healthy. But, 
unfortunately, the practical working-out of the teaching of 
physiology in the schools seems to have been unsuccessful. 
It is difficult to get children interested in health for health’s 
sake, but we may connect hygiene with other science topics 
and activities in which the child is interested. In connection 
with gardening may be taken up the question of exercise, 
and the study of fruits and vegetables as foods. In connec- 
tion with the methods of heating the home there naturally 
arises the question of ventilation. The study of the fly brings 
up the subject of bacteria in relation to disease. And with 
other topics of hygiene it is believed that better results will 
follow if they are arranged as an organic part of the science 
course. The work in hygiene has been so incorporated in the 
outline of science given in chapter XIX. 
The hygienic aim should be kept in mind throughout all 
the grades, beginning with the youngest children and in- 
creasing in importance as the advancing age of the children 
enables them better to understand the need and laws of 
hygienic living. 
Abandoned disciplinary theory. In the years past the dis- 
ciplinary aim of education has been dominant, in accord- 
ance with which the chief aim of education was to discipline 
the various powers of the mind, such as the powers of ob- 
servation, reasoning, and memory in the belief that after 
these had been trained in school the powers thus acquired 
could be turned to use in any walk of life. In connection 
with science it was common to emphasize the value of train- 
ing the power of observation. The researches of modern 
psychology compel the abandonment of this theory of gen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
16 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
eral discipline and the substitution of the theory of specific 
discipline, in accordance with which training that is received 
in school becomes useful elsewhere only when applied to the 
same or similar conditions. It would be beyond the purpose 
of this book to enter into a discussion of the theory of formal 
discipline; it will suffice merely to state that the results of 
numerous experiments have led practically every educator 
and psychologist in the country to abandon the theory of 
formal discipline, which has dominated our schools for so 
many years, and from whose shackles, unfortunately, many 
of the school subjects have not yet freed themselves. 
In accordance with the modern interpretation the child 
should be taught in science to observe and reason about 
those things in school which it is desirable for him to observe 
and reason about in actual life. The use of the power of 
observation is a method by which science is taught, but the 
training of this power should not be the aim. It is a means, 
and not an end. 
Another serious objection to the disciplinary theory is the 
fact that it is non-selective in its functioning. An aim should 
serve as a guide-post to the teacher, pointing out the things 
to be taught. The disciplinary aim does not serve this 
function, for the study of any one form of life will serve the 
purpose of developing the power of observation as well as 
the study of any other related form.

CHAPTER IT 
MATERIALS AND CORRELATION 
Materials 
Ons of the features that characterizes science and makes it 
worth while is the fact that it deals largely with the concrete 
things in the child’s environment. In order that the child 
may derive the most benefit from his study, it is necessary 
that he should have actual concrete materials to use in his 
lessons. The procuring of materials for science lessons, then, 
is something for which the teacher should make definite 
plans. Frequently the assistance of the children may be 
sought in securing material, and this forms a valuable ex- 
perience for the children. 
| Types of materials. The great mass of materials available 
may be classified into the following groups: (1) living things 
in their natural environment; (2) living things in the school- 
room; (3) preserved material; (4) pictures; (5) apparatus for 
demonstration and experiments. 
(1) Living material in natural environment. The best kind 
of material for the study of plants and animals is the living 
object in its natural environment, because this is the way it 
is actually seen in the life of the child. This study of material 
outdoors may be carried on in two ways: by means of indi- 
vidual studies made by the children under the suggestions 
of the teacher, and by means of field trips in which the 
teacher accompanies a group of children. Both of these 
methods are desirable. 
Individual observations by children. The first method of 
studying life in its natural environment, by encouraging and 
expecting the children to make studies by themselves, is   
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
one of the most valuable lines of work that can be done. One 
of the applications which it is desirable that the child shall 
make throughout his life is the observation of the wild life 
around him; and the more closely we can approximate in 
school the application desired in life, the greater is the 
probability that this application will be made. In connec- 
tion with each lesson the teacher may suggest some ques- 
tions that the child may answer from outdoor studies of the 
topic of the lesson. For the older children these questions 
may be written on the board. At the next lesson an oppor- 
tunity should be given for the children to make reports on 
what they have observed. As the children become more 
observant and self-reliant, fewer details will need to be given, 
and finally they may be thrown on their own responsibility 
regarding the points to be studied. One purpose of a lesson 
should be to arouse enough interest so that the children will 
want to make further studies of the topic under discussion. 
At first there will be many children who will not make these 
studies, but the number who do make them can be greatly 
increased by expecting the children to do this, the same as 
any home work, and by giving frequent opportunities for 
them to report on their observations. 
This work will be greatly stimulated by keeping spring 
calendars of birds and flowers, in which a record is kept of 
the name of the bird or flower seen, the date when first seen, 
and the name of the child first reporting it. This record may 
be kept either on the blackboard or on a large piece of card- 
board. Similar calendars may be kept of the leafing and 
flowering of trees in the spring and of the coloring and fall 
of the leaves in the autumn. 
Field trips. The final desired end is that the child shall 
be observant of nature when by himself, and one of the 
chief values of the formal field trip with the teacher is that 
these trips may lead to this end. The teacher may arouse
-P-A-G-E-29
  . MATERIALS AND CORRELATION 19 
an interest in the child and she may suggest what to study 
and how to observe. Thus the child will be led to individual 
observations. 
This kind of work should be strongly emphasized wher- 
ever possible. The conditions in many of our schools are 
such that it is not practicable to take many field trips. 
But plans can often be made to take at least one trip a 
term. If a class is too large to be taken altogether, fre- 
quently arrangements can be made to take half of the class 
at a time and leave the other half in charge of the prin- 
cipal. This half may then be taken on a trip at some later 
time. 
Careful preparation should be made by the teacher for 
this trip. She should go over the ground a day or two before 
the trip is to be taken and see just what material is available, 
and decide definitely on what the children are to study. 
She should make the purpose of the trip very clear to the 
children before starting, so that they may have a definite 
aim to guide them. There are so many distracting things 
that it is specially important that they should start out with 
this definite purpose. After certain outdoor studies have 
been made it may be wise in some cases to gather material, 
when feasible, and take it back to the schoolroom, where 
it may be studied more carefully with fewer things to dis- 
tract the attention of the children. 
(2) Living material in the schoolroom. In some ways the 
most practical kind of material is the living specimen kept 
in the schoolroom. Here the environment is missing, but 
life is still left. There is a great abundance of material 
available here. Various kinds of pets, including canaries, 
may be kept in the schoolroom for a short time. A great 
many insects, such as crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars, 
and many others may be kept in glass jars covered with 
mosquito netting; mosquito wigglers may be kept in tum-
-P-A-G-E-30
20 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
blers; fishes, tadpoles, snails, toad’s eggs, and many kinds 
of water insects may be kept in glass jars filled with water. 
Nearly all kinds of plants may be kept in the schoolroom, 
such as flowers, leaves of trees, ferns, and mushrooms. 
Experiments may be performed with seeds and seedlings; 
and house plants, such as ferns, geraniums, and bulbs, can 
be kept permanently in the room. 
(3) Preserved specimens. In the group of preserved 
specimens life and environment are both missing and only 
the form is left, but for some topics this kind of material 
serves the purpose well. Children can be set to work making 
collections, and thus while looking for materials they will 
find objects in their natural environment. Some of these 
materials may be collected and kept in the schoolroom 
without any preparation to preserve them; such as bird’s 
nests, galls, cocoons, wasp’s nests, tree fruits, specimens of 
woods, woody mushrooms, weed seeds, ears of corn, plants 
of wheat, and other cereal crops. Some materials, such as 
flowers, ferns, weeds, leaves of trees, shrubs, and vines, 
may be preserved by pressing them between the leaves of 
books or between the folds of newspapers, with weights 
placed upon them. Insects may be kept in glass mounts 
made of old negatives. The older boys, in connection with 
the work in manual training, may make a simple museum 
case in which these materials may be kept. 
(4) Pictures. In the picture not only are the environment 
and life gone, but the thing itself as well, and we are dealing 
with only a representation of the real thing. But pictures 
have their place, and for some objects form very desirable 
material, as in the case of birds. These show the colors well, 
and many suggest something of the environment. 
(5) Apparatus for demonstration and experiments. For 
much of the work in physical science, and for some work 
in hygiene and with plants, simple apparatus will be needed
-P-A-G-E-31
MATERIALS AND CORRELATION Ql 
   
                                                                for demonstrations and experiments. Suggestions are given 
in the chapters dealing with these topics. 
The topic to be studied should be so chosen according to 
season that the illustrative material may be easily available. 
In many cases the children will help the teacher secure the 
material, but the teacher herself must take the final respon- 
sibility to see that the material is actually present when 
needed. 
Amount of material. The amount of duplicate material 
needed for a lesson varies according to the topic. In some 
cases each child may be provided with a specimen for study, 
as with weeds, leaves, seeds, and many flowers. This makes 
an ideal situation, because each child has opportunity to 
make his own individual studies without depending on any 
one else. In many cases it is not feasible to procure material 
for each child. In some of these cases the teacher may plan 
to secure a specimen for each row of pupils. In still other 
cases only one specimen may be available for the whole 
room. 
In the experimental work done in physical science one 
set of apparatus will be sufficient. The experiment may be 
performed by the teacher for the entire class, oftentimes 
with the assistance of some of the pupils. 
How to use material. In using material one important 
principle should be kept in mind, that enough time should 
be taken to allow each child to study the material. Recent 
experiments have shown that the time factor is an impor- 
tant element in observation; that one of thé chief ways to 
insure accurate observation is to allow plenty of time for 
the object to be studied. When only one specimen is avail- 
able this thought should be especially kept in mind, because 
when the teacher simply holds up the material in the front 
of the room, only the few children near the teacher have a 
satisfactory opportunity to study the specimen, while those 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
in the rear of the room may get very little from the lesson. 
The material should be passed around by the teacher or 
‘some child, or else groups of children may come up in turn 
and study the specimen. This will take more time, but it is 
necessary if all the children are to derive the full value of the 
lesson. When only one specimen is available an excellent 
way to have it studied by all is to leave it on the table or 
window sill for several days, and suggest that the children 
study it at odd moments during the day. 
If a specimen is provided for each row it may be studied 
by each child individually and handed back from seat to 
seat, or the children in each row may study it as a group. 
‘One point to consider in the use of material by the chil- 
dren is the fact that when children handle material they 
are using another sense, that of touch as well as that of 
sight, and hence they learn more quickly than they would 
by sight alone because they are acquiring knowledge through 
two avenues. 
Relation of science to other subjects 
The nearer our schoolroom procedure can approach life 
conditions, the more effective will our teaching be, as the 
greater are the probabilities that the child will make use of 
that which he learns in school. Correlation is the natural 
and common procedure in ordinary life. The unit here is 
not the subject-matter involved, but the activity in which 
the person is engaged, and our ordinary activities involve 
a great variety of subjects. Hence, natural correlation is 
a desirable thing to be made an organic part of teaching. 
Convenience seems to demand that the various subjects 
should be taught separately, and hence there is all the more 
need that there should be found some interest which shall 
unite and correlate these various subjects. 
Furthermore, psychology teaches that when a topic is
-P-A-G-E-33
  MATERIALS AND CORRELATION 23 
approached from several standpoints and taught in its 
relation to other things, it becomes more surely a part of 
the child’s experiences than if taught disconnectedly. 
Science and art. There are many opportunities for nat- 
ural correlation in teaching science. This is specially true in 
connection with art, literature, and language. Many sci- 
ence topics permit of correlation with art. Much of the 
material used in the science lessons may be reproduced by 
the child by means of free-hand drawings with colored 
crayons for younger children, and outline drawings and 
paintings in water-colors for older children. For young 
children a large amount of hand work is necessary through- 
out all departments of school work, and the drawings may 
furnish some of this in connection with the nature-study 
lessons. 
Science and literature. In literature will be found many 
references to nature, and he who would most truly appreci- 
ate literature needs to know something of the plants and 
animals to which reference is made. Our poets write often 
of birds, flowers, and trees; and whenever these forms are 
studied in the science lesson the study of some appropriate 
poem will add greatly to the child’s appreciation of the 
object studied. It is also true from the standpoint of liter- 
ature that the child’s appreciation of the poem is-increased 
through a study of the forms to which reference is made. 
Science and geography. In home geography the correla- 
tion between nature-study and geography is so close that 
frequently the two are taught together for the first two or 
three grades under the name of nature-study. The relation 
between these subjects is also close in the later grades. 
Geography is constantly dealing with science topics, thus 
presenting a natural opportunity for correlation. 
Other opportunities for correlation. There are also op- 
portunities for the correlation of science with manual train- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
ing in making bird-houses and fly-traps and in connection 
with the study of gardening. Problems for arithmetic may 
be found in connection with the study of birds, trees, and 
weeds. Opportunities for correlation with language are con- 
stantly presenting themselves. Reports by the children or 
what they have observed outdoors or what they have donc 
in connection with outdoor activities, furnish excellent op- 
portunities for teaching the correct use of English. 
Methods of correlation. Correlation may be brought 
about in several ways. If it is desired to correlate science 
and art the following possibilities arise: first, during the 
art period a brief study from the science standpoint may 
be made of the material being drawn; second, during the 
science period drawings may be made of the materials being 
studied; and third, the same topic may be studied in both 
the science and art periods — in one from the science stand- 
point, in the other from the art standpoint. The method 
to be used will depend upon the conditions existing in the 
school. The last arrangement seems from some standpoints 
the ideal one, but under present conditions it is difficult to 
bring it about in the graded schools. If both subjects to be 
correlated are taught the methods suggested under one and 
two offer the best opportunity. If only one of the subjects 
is taught in the school the only possibility is to correlate 
with the other subject during the regular period of the first 
one. The writer suggests that the teacher may occasion- 
ally utilize a part of the science period for art work or for 
the study of literature appropriate to the topic. 
The chart on page 25 may suggest some of the possibili- 
ties of correlation with a few leading science topics.

CHAPTER IV 
MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
Onk of the first and most fundamental things to which 
the teacher of science should give attention is proper moti- 
vation of the subject on the part of the child. Motivation 
involves three steps: first, a consideratioh of the children’s 
experiences so as to make the proper connections; second, 
a problem to arouse the children’s interest and to guide 
them in their work; and third, The“use of what they have 
learned as the final outcome of what precedes. There has 
been in the past, and unfortunately still is, too much pur- 
poseless teaching of science and of other subjects as well; 
but it seems as though the defect were especially inexcus- 
able in science, because the subject touches the child’s life 
at so many vital points. The efficiency which modern life is 
demanding of the schools must cause us to substitute for 
this aimless, unguided study of nature topics a vital, pur- 
poseful study of those things that are worth while in the 
child’s life. 
The child and the curriculum. The first essential in proper 
motivation, is that the thing being done should be worth 
while from the child’s standpoint. This brings us at once 
to the fundamental principle that the child is the deter- 
mining factor in the school. Life must be viewed through 
the child’s eyes, and the curriculum planned accordingly. 
Not only the method of teaching, but the content of the 
course must find its basis in the child’s life. In the centu- 
ries past both the method and content found their basis in 
the life of the adult and not in that of the child. As a result 
of the psychological studies of the past century the principle
-P-A-G-E-37
  MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING Q7 
that the method of teaching should find its basis in the 
child’s life has been universally accepted. The consequent 
practice of this Bree has become fairly well established 
in our schools. 
The studies of recent years have established the principle 
that the content of the school curriculum should also find 
its basis in the child’s life. We are now in the midst of actu- 
ally putting this principle into practice in our school pro- 
cedure. 
Fallacies of storage system of education. The old con- 
ception of basing the content of the course on the adult 
needs, — on what the child might need when he becomes 
an adult, — is based on a number of misconceptions of the 
value and fullness of child life, and on a misunderstanding 
of the laws of psychology. The old conception that the 
school should teach the child what he will need when he 
grows up has been aptly termed the storage system of edu- 
cation. The idea back of this is that the child’s mind may 
be stored with facts that will prove useful in later life, and 
that they will be retained there and can be used whenever 
the adult finds need for them. This is based on two falla- 
cies: First it assumes that knowledge which the child learns 
can be retained in mind a long time, even when not used, 
and then applied in later life. This assumption is false, be- 
cause experiments have shown that knowledge is soon lost 
unless it is used. The second fallacy on which the storage 
system of education rests is the idea that child life in itself 
is barren and incomplete, and that it is only in adult life 
that experiences become really worth while. 
Richness of child’s life. Even a very hasty glance at 
child life shows that it is rich and full in those experiences 
that go to make up life, and that it is full of opportunities 
to make present use of knowledge. The bodily needs that 
relate to health are the same as those for the adult. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
28 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
same underlying principles of hygiene regarding food, air, 
and cleanliness apply to both alike. These laws of hygiene 
require constant daily application. 
In enjoyment the child’s life is a full one. Play naturally 
makes up a large and vital element in his life. He enjoys 
many of the same things as does the adult, of which the 
“movies” are a constant reminder. The child’s enjoyment 
of physical bodily activities exceeds that of the adult. 
The child’s temptations and sorrows are just as real and 
varied to the child as they will be later in his adult life. 
True, his sorrows are transient, but nevertheless real. Per- 
haps in some ways the child is exposed to a greater variety 
of temptations than the adult, because the adult has most 
of his habits of life well established, and things which in 
earlier years were a constant temptation while habits were 
being formed, have now ceased to be temptations because 
established habits of right conduct have eliminated them. 
Children’s experiences abound in social life and its corre- 
sponding duties. The child’s play life is largely a social life. 
To even a larger extent than the adult, children are together 
in their various activities. And in these gatherings there 
arise the same problems that arise in adult gatherings: 
leadership, duties to each other, the establishment of a ba- 
sis on which intercourse is possible, the punishment of those 
who offend these requirements, and so on through a long 
list of social activities. 
And so from morning till night the child’s day is full of 
its activities and needs, quite as varied as those of the adult, 
and offering equal opportunities for the application of useful 
knowledge. The school should seek to give the child those 
things that these present activities demand. 
Relation of present and future needs. In basing the con- 
tent of the school subjects on the child’s possible future 
needs as an adult, we find the serious difficulty that no one 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING 29 
knows what a person will be doing and where he will be in 
the future, and, as a result, no specific individual education 
is possible, but only a vague general education. And even 
when one can see some things that the adult will need, such 
as the ability to read, still we must find the basis for teach- 
ing reading in the use that the child makes of it in his present 
life. And if one can foresee what the child will need later 
in life, but does not need and cannot use in his present, it 
will be useless to teach these things to the child, because 
they will soon be forgotten unless the child finds some im- 
mediate use for them. And, furthermore, many of the 
children will never live to reach adulthood, so that if we are 
thinking only or chiefly of the future, in these cases the en- 
ergy and time spent in the education of the child have been 
wasted from the standpoint of both the child and the State. 
The school should so educate the child as to give him the 
things he needs most up to any given moment. At every 
stage of the child’s development the educational system 
should be complete and symmetrical up to that point, ac- 
cording to the needs of the child. And as the child develops 
the educational system should adapt itself accordingly to 
the changing needs of the child. Each need should be met 
when it arises. It is not a proper figure to use to say that 
in the early years of the school course the foundation of 
the building is laid, and that, as the child grows older, the 
other parts are added till the building is complete when 
the child becomes an adult. Rather should we say that at 
each and every stage of the school course we have built a 
complete structure, and that in later years the building 
simply grows larger. 
Stressing of the present in education. This stressing of 
the present life of the child does not mean the neglect of 
the future, but, on the other hand, it represents the only 
effective means of preparing for the future. The fulfillment
-P-A-G-E-40
  30 : THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
of the child’s present needs is the best possible preparation 
for whatever later needs may arise. It is like the young 
apple tree. The first year it is set out it must be given the 
care that it demands for that particular year and season. 
Then the second year the care needed for that season must 
be given, and so on until finally the tree reaches maturity 
and bears fruit. 
This principle is recognized in the care of the child’s 
physical needs. In order that the child may be a strong, 
healthy adult, we take those steps necessary to keep him 
healthy as a child. Likewise in the moral field, in order to 
develop a man with a proper perspective of life who shall 
perform his duties toward his fellows, the child is taught 
year by year the moral precepts that he needs for that par- 
ticular age. And so in the mental life of the child the same 
principle holds, in order to develop a man who can make the 
best use of his mind in the part that he is to play in life, 
we must help the child in each stage of his development to 
make the best possible use of the mental powers which he 
possesses at that time. 
Motivation through children’s problems. The way to 
secure motivation is to center the school work around the 
real problems of children. These must have their source in 
the children’s present activities, and must appeal to some 
interest or fill some real need that the child feels. A sharp 
distinction should be drawn between children’s problems 
and adult problems. Much attention is being given to the 
problem method of teaching, but in many cases the problems 
used are adult problems, and so do not serve to arouse the 
children’s interests. In order that the problem may func- 
tion in furnishing motivation it is necessary that it should 
find its fulfillment in the present or immediate future of the 
child, because the farther away in time the fulfillment is 
the less it appeals to the children, till no appeal at all is 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING 31 
made if the time is very long. With young children in the 
primary grades the interest is carried forward only a very 
short time, while, as the child grows older, the time ahead 
during which interest may be aroused becomes longer. 
External and internal stimuli. The chief value of chil- 
dren’s problems lies in the fact that they act as a stimulus 
to arouse the children’s interest. Too often the stimulus 
that directs the child in school is an external one, imposed 
from without, in the form of love for or fear of parents or 
teacher. The real problems of children serve as a natural 
internal stimulus arising from the child’s interests and guid- 
ing him to do things because they appeal to him and seem 
worth while. Successful teaching consists largely in arous- 
ing and directing children’s interests. After the children 
are really interested the rest of teaching follows easily and 
naturally. 
The right kind of children’s problems is a powerful means 
of awakening interest, and thus supplying motive power for 
the work to be done. Children want to do things, not be- 
cause they are commanded by some one in authority over 
them, but because they can see some benefit to them from 
’ doing a certain thing. And this internal stimulus leads to 
much more effective and lasting results than the external 
stimulus. It will make the children aggressive in encour- 
aging self-activity, instead of being mere passive listeners. 
The external stimulus leads only to temporary results, 
while the internal leads to permanent results. As soon as 
the cause of the external stimulus is removed the child’s 
interest is lost and the thing ceases to play any part in his 
life, but if the stimulus is a true internal motive it stays 
with the child constantly and guides him, not merely in 
school, but outside as well. 
In seeking to motivate the work of the children the 
teacher should see to it that the motive is a real one in the
-P-A-G-E-42
  82 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
child’s life, and not simply a passing interest aroused by 
the strong personality of the teacher or by skillful methods 
of teaching. The author has observed strong, vivacious 
teachers who could sweep along a roomful of children by 
their enthusiasm, and arouse a temporary interest in the 
most abstract and meaningless topics. But there was no 
real inherent motive on the part of the children, and, after 
the lesson was over, the matter dropped from their minds. 
So that in judging teaching it is not enough merely to 
ascertain whether the children are interested; we must go 
farther back and seek the cause of this interest. Is there 
back of it a real child’s motive, or is there simply an artificial 
‘incentive furnished by the teacher’s personality? A teacher 
who has the power of arousing temporary interest, even in 
abstract topics foreign to the children’s experiences, has a 
talent for teaching, but how much greater the returns if 
this talent is turned toward directing children along lines 
of their natural interests. 
Interest and learning. Children’s problems are a means 
of arousing interest, and interest plays a fundamental part 
in the process of learning. It is necessary for the best 
development of the child. The child works with greater 
speed and with more accuracy; facts are remembered longer 
and more easily. The apparent fatigue of children in the 
afternoon has been shown to be not a real mental fatigue 
due to overwork, but to be due simply to lack of interest. 
As a result of being guided by these definite purposes 
the children develop more initiative and independence in 
their work. This gives the children more enthusiasm for 
their task, which leads to more vigorous efforts, resulting in 
greater success. This, in turn, is a powerful incentive for 
continued endeavor. Thus is the problem of discipline 
largely solved, because the children are occupied in doing 
something that appeals to them as being worth while.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING 83 
Awakening dormant interests. One purpose of science 
teaching is to arouse new interests in the children. One of 
the chief reasons why so few people appreciate and enjoy 
nature is simply because no one has called their attention 
to the great possibilities of enjoyment to be found here. 
One of the important purposes of teaching science is to lead 
the child to see and appreciate some of the great variety of 
beautiful and interesting things which everywhere abound 
in nature, but which otherwise remain as a closed book to 
him. 
The children’s interest is easily aroused in these subjects. 
These interests have been lying dormant, merely waiting 
to be awakened. So that the test of what to teach in science 
is not merely and only that for which the child already has 
a feeling of interest or need, but also that for which he can 
be led to have such a feeling. If the interests thus awak- 
ened have their fulfillment in the present or immediate 
future of the child, his life has been enriched thereby. The 
interests that we seek to arouse are of this kind, because we 
wish to lead the child to see and appreciate the things about 
him. As soon as he sees them, they function at once in his 
experiences. The reason they have not previously functioned 
has not been because they were foreign to his interests or 
because their fulfillment was far in the future; but it has 
simply been because he has not known of these things in 
his environment. Thus education should ever seek to 
broaden and enlarge the child’s experiences and to arouse 
dormant interests of the right kind so that the child may 
grow. 
Elimination. This discussion of motivation leads to one 
very important conclusion, namely, that only those things 
should be taught that are useful in some way to the child, 
and hence have a meaning to him. It is psychologically 
impossible for a child to have a real motive for doing things  
-P-A-G-E-44
84 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
that are meaningless to him. The teacher may arouse a 
temporary interest in such things, but there is no real 
motive back of it. This means the elimination of much 
useless material from the school subjects. It is already be- 
ing done in arithmetic, grammar, spelling, and other sub- 
jects. It should also be done in science. This is especially 
true of physiology. A large proportion of the time has 
been devoted to topics that are entirely meaningless to 
the child, such as most of the anatomy and physiology. 
Practically all of this should be eliminated and the time 
devoted to hygiene. In elementary agriculture also much 
has been taught that is foreign to the child’s interests and 
capacities. The whole field of agriculture needs to be gone 
over very carefully, with the child’s needs and interests in 
mind, and much material eliminated. 
Perhaps the chief elimination in science should come, not 
so much in the topics studied as in the facts about the topics 
that are considered and in the observations made. In some 
cases a topic which in itself is worth while may be chosen 
for study, but the time may be occupied with many mean- 
ingless observations and the real points of interest may be 
obscured in a mass of detail. These meaningless observa- 
tions should be eliminated. 
Specific motives in teaching science. In concluding this 
chapter some definite motives that may be used in teaching 
science may be suggested. Science touches the child’s lif 
in so many vital points that there seems little excuse for no 
properly motivating this subject. It is easily done. Some of 
these motives may be briefly listed as follows: — 
1. Identification of common plants and animals, such as 
birds, trees, and flowers. 
2. Earning money, as in gardening, poultry-keeping, and 
selling bird-houses. 
8. Care of pets and domesticated animals. 
   
-P-A-G-E-45
  MOTIVATION OF SCIENCE TEACHING 35 
. Competition for prizes, as in gardening and building 
bird-houses. 
. Making collections, as of seeds, leaves, weeds, flowers, 
newspaper clippings. 
. Making things, as bird-houses and window-boxes. 
. Games and sports, as skating, coasting, playground 
apparatus, movies. 
. Study of the operation of machines, as engines, motors, 
and automobiles.

  CHAPTER V 
METHODS OF TEACHING SCIENCE 
In order to procure proper motivation it is suggested that 
the three following points be considered by the teacher in 
planning her lessons: first, the child’s problem; second, the 
development of the lesson; and third, the application. The 
most important thing is the child’s problem, because this is 
the center that determines the development of the lesson 
and its application. 
Value of a problem. In the previous chapter the value 
of the child’s problem in arousing interest and motivating 
the work was shown. The problem will also be a great help 
to the teacher as she plans her lesson, both in selecting and 
in organizing the subject-matter. 
It also serves as a guide during the lesson for both teacher 
and children, in determining what shall be included in the 
lesson. Many times when the lesson is begun without any 
definite purpose on the part of the children, some little 
incident may deflect the discussion entirely away from that 
which the teacher had in mind to accomplish, and she is 
perplexed to know how to direct the lesson back to the 
desired end. With a definite problem before the children 
this difficulty is solved, because the problem is a constant 
guide. If the recitation is getting away from the problem, 
mere calling attention to it will enable the children them- 
selves to determine whether the points under discussion re- 
late to the problem; and if not, the children may orient 
themselves. It thus serves as a guide to both children and 
teacher. 
One of the chief values of the problem lies in the fact that
-P-A-G-E-47
METHODS OF TEACHING SCIENCE meey! 
it permits so much of the initiative for what is being done 
to come from the child. The child’s problem, and not the 
teacher, is the determining factor. 
Lack of a problem in teaching illustrated. As a definite 
illustration of the aid that a child’s problem gives the 
teacher in selecting and organizing material, and gives both 
teacher and children in guiding the lesson, we will take a 
lesson on a maple tree. If the teacher is to give a lesson on 
this topic, and has no definite problem in mind, she does 
not know what points to take up. The whole discussion is 
confused and indefinite. Not having any definite purpose 
to accomplish the teacher does not know when the lesson has 
ended. 
Many insignificant details may be observed about the 
leaf, such as length of petiole, color of petiole, length and 
breadth of leaf, number of points or lobes on the margin, 
color of upper and lower surfaces, general shape, roughness 
and hairiness of surfaces, number and arrangement of 
veins, and so on indefinitely, observing petty points, most 
of which have no significance to the child. The points that 
do have meaning to him are buried in such a mass of detail 
that he does not see their significance. Anything about the 
tree may be considered, the lesson may be extended to any 
length of time, there is no special reason why the maple 
tree should be studied, and no use of the knowledge gained 
is called for. 
Value of a problem in teaching illustrated. But how 
different the situation becomes when we start with a definite 
problem like the following: “We will study the maple tree 
so that we can tell it from the elm tree as we see it growing.” 
Now the points to be taken up stand out sharply; they are 
the differences between the maple tree and the elm tree. 
Tf the lesson is an indoor one, the leaves may be studied to 
note their differences in shape, margin, veining, etc.; like- 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  
38 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
wise for the features seen only outdoors, differences in the 
shape and method of branching of the trees. All these 
points, otherwise disconnected, fall into a regular orderly 
series, and thus the problem helps not only in the selection, 
but in the arrangement of material as well. Large groups 
of differences stand out first; such as differences in leaves, 
in fruit, in bark; then each of these has its subdivisions. 
Thus this definite problem serves as a central thought 
for the whole lesson, a definite aim toward which all may 
work, and as a result they know when they have reached 
the goal and the purpose of the lesson has been accom- 
plished. And the statement of the problem suggests in itself 
the use to be made of the knowledge gained, namely, to 
find the two trees growing and to distinguish them. 
Can any one doubt what the difference will be between 
these two lessons in the attitude of both teacher and 
children and in the interest shown? One has but to visit 
schoolrooms and observe the two types of lessons, one 
aimless, the other definitely motivated, to be thoroughly 
convinced of the vast gulf that separates these two meth- 
ods of teaching. 
In order that a problem may accomplish its purpose of 
arousing the interest of the child, it must be very definite 
and specific. Broad general purposes such as the teacher 
may have in mind make little appeal to the child. His 
problem must be one that is possible of immediate fulfill- 
ment. 
Presenting problem to children. If the problem is to serve 
as the guide and motive power for the lesson, it is self- 
evident that the first step of the teacher is to get the 
problem clearly before the children, and to show the rela- 
tion between the work to be done and the end that the child 
seeks. In bringing the problem before the children use 
should be made of the principle of apperception. The knowl-
-P-A-G-E-49
METHODS OF TEACHING SCIENCE 39 
edge which the children already possess regarding the 
problem or some topic related to it should be brought out 
by questioning, and then the problem should be presented 
to the children. The skillful introduction to the problem 
plays an important part in arousing the interest of the 
children in the problem itself. The problem must be clearly 
shown to be related to the children’s experiences, to some- 
thing regarding which they already have some knowledge. 
The child has no interest in what is absolutely foreign to 
his experiences. 
Development. The development should be so planned as 
to answer the question raised in the problem. Enough points 
should be included to answer the question satisfactorily, 
and those points which have no bearing on the problem 
should be omitted. Here is where the matter of elimina- 
tion comes in, eliminating, not the whole topic, but those 
phases of the topic which have no meaning for the problem 
involved. 
After those points have been selected which are needed 
to solve the problem, the next matter to consider is the 
organization of this material. This means first putting 
together in large groups those things that naturally belong 
together, and then, secondly, making the proper subdivi- 
sions of each group. And, finally, there is the matter of se- 
quence, as to which point shall come first and which last. 
‘his organization should be made from the standpoint of 
he child and not from that of the adult. In those problems 
hich involve some manual activity, such as gardening and 
ding bird-houses, the most natural sequence from the 
hild’s standpoint is the order in which the various things 
re actually done, those which are done first being con- 
idered first, and so on till the last step is reached. The 
hild’s problem will prove a great help in organizing the 
subject-matter.    
   
             
   
                           
    
   
       
  
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Application. The final step comes in the application or 
use of what the child has learned. The use of knowledge is 
the chief end of education. A lesson without application 
means wasted effort. One of the vital things in planning 
a science lesson is to consider how the children may be 
encouraged to make use of what they have learned. If the 
problem does not seem to allow of any application, we may 
well inquire whether the problem is really worth while. 
And, indeed, the best kind of problem suggests the applica- 
tion, because it is the possibility suggested by the problem 
of helping the child do something which he wants to do 
that furnishes the main element in motivation. 
The word “application” is used in a very broad sense to 
include any use of knowledge that has any worth to the 
child; it may be in deriving greater pleasure in life, or it 
may be in aiding him better to perform his home duties. 
Knowledge is useful when it helps in any way to make life 
more worth living. 
During the lesson the teacher should suggest ways in 
which the children may make use of what they have 
learned, and do what she can to encourage it. The children 
may be asked to do certain things, and at the beginning of 
each science lesson opportunity may be given for them to} 
report on their observations. This method may be used fre- 
quently in the effort to awaken dormant interests in nature, 
If the children are asked and expected to make these aj 
plications, and opportunities are given for reporting to th 
teacher or class, this will serve as an additional stimulus. 
It will be found that the number of children who repo: 
on their observations may be gradually increased by con 
stant encouragement. 
Following are suggested some ways in which applicatio: 
may be made: (1) actually doing things suggested in th 
lesson, as in planting a home garden, destroying insect pest:

   and weeds, building nesting-boxes for birds, planting trees, 
helping parents at home, forming hygienic habits; (2) watch- 
ing others doing the things studied, as the farmer and gar- 
dener ploughing their fields or harvesting their crops; 
(3) making outdoor observations on the topics studied, 
such as flowers, trees, birds, and insects in their natural 
environment, and observations of the structure and working 
of common applications of science, such as the automobile 
and telephone; (4) bringing specimens to school to show the 
children’s ability to identify the form studied, such as 
flowers, weeds, and leaves of trees; (5) making collections, 
such as weed seeds, woods, nests, woody mushrooms, 
flowers, leaves of trees, ferns, and insects; (6) talking over 
with the parents at home the topic studied; (7) cutting out 
clippings from newspapers and magazines relating to the 
topic under consideration. 
A few suggestions regarding the working-out of the vari- 
us parts of a lesson plan are summarized below in brief 
utline form. 
Summarized Suggestions for Lesson Plan 
. Introduction to child's problem. 
1. The introduction to the child’s problem should deal with 
the children’s experiences. 
2. It should be appropriate to the problem. 
. Statement of child’s problem. 
1. The child’s problem should relate to those things for which 
the child already has a feeling of interest or need, or for 
which he can be led to have such a feeling. 
2. It should find its basis in the child’s present life, or in that 
of his immediate future. 
. It should be worth while. 
. It should be definite. 
. It should deal with only one main thought. 
. It should be clearly stated in children’s language. ore oO

1. All points included in the development should relate to the 
problem. 
2. Enough points should be included to answer the problem. 
8. The development should be well organized with reference

interests the child and which can be done naturally in his| 
ordinary life. 
2. It should suggest the doing of only a few things, preferabl, 
of only one thing. 
8. It should be stated clearly and with sufficient detail so that 
the child understands what he is to do. 
As a definite illustration of these suggestions the fol 
lowing lesson is given for a third grade: — 
An Illustrative Third-Grade Lesson 
I. Topic: Elm and maple tree. 
II. Grade: Third. 
III. Season: Fall or spring. 
IV. Materials: A maple and elm leaf for each child; a cluster o! 
elm and maple leaves showing arrangement. 
V. The Lesson. 
A. Child’s problem. 
1. Introduction to child’s problenl. 
How many children have trees in your yard at home 
How many different kinds have you? Have you notice 
how many kinds of trees there are in our school yard! 
Would you like to know the names of these trees so tl 
you can call them by their names as you do your friends| 
The trees growng in our yard are the elm and the maple. 
2. Statement of child’s problem. 
I have here some leaves from these trees, and we wi 
study them to see how they differ, so that we can tell 
elm from the maple tree by means of their leaves. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
METHODS OF TEACHING SCIENCE 43 
B. Development. 
Outline of points Questions 
1. Shape of leaf..What differences do you find in these 
leaves? How are they different in shape? 
Several may go to the board and make a 
drawing of each leaf, and we will ask the 
class to decide which shows the shape 
best. 
BiOie sh te. ess Is there any difference in the size? 
Si Margin. 3.0.5: Are the edges alike? Make a drawing on 
the board of the edges of the two leaves. 
4. Veining........ Do the veins run in the same way in both 
leaves? Can some one make a drawing 
to show the difference? 
5. Arrangement...Look at these clusters I have here and 
see if the leaves are placed the same on 
both trees. 
Which do you think is the surest way 
to tell these leaves apart? 
C. Application. 
When school is dimissed you may look carefully at the leaves 
of the trees in the school yard and find a maple tree and an elm 
tree. Bring in a leaf from each tree. To-morrow I will ask each 
of you to tell the class exactly where these two trees are. When 
the leaves begin to change color, we will watch these two trees 
and see if their leaves turn the same color. 
D. Correlated work. 
1. Art. 
A few children may be asked to make drawings of the 
leaves on the board, and besides this, at the close of the 
lesson, each child may make a free-hand outline drawing 
of each leaf with pencil, or a mass drawing may be made 
with green crayons. Free-hand cuttings may be made, 
then colored with crayons. Blue prints of the leaves side 
by side may be made. 
2. Literature. 
After the lesson on the trees has been given, some of the 
following literature may be read to the children: — 
Lovejoy, Nature in Verse, page 203. 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Stone and Fickett, Trees in Poetry and Prose, pages 25- 
39; 81-93. 
Wait and Leanard, Among Flowers and Trees with the 
Poets, pages 286; 297-300. 
In the development the outline suggests the main points 
to be brought out that will help to solve the child’s problem. 
The exact questions to be asked cannot be definitely planned 
beforehand. It is better to ask a few leading questions than 
many minor ones. The question involved in the statement 
of the problem, “What differences do you find in these 
leaves?” would be sufficient to bring out most of the points 
in the lesson. After the children have exhausted their 
answers to this question, if some other points of difference 
have been overlooked the teacher may then ask other ques- 
tions to direct the children’s attention to these points. The 
questions given in this lesson are intended for this purpose 
in case some point is overlooked. It is not expected that it 
will be necessary actually to ask all these questions. 
Place of observation in teaching science. The abandon- 
ment of the old faculty psychology, and the very radical 
modification of the theory of formal discipline now gener- 
ally accepted, must have an important bearing on aims and 
methods of teaching science. We can no longer entertain 
the idea that there is a general power of observation which 
can be trained by observing anything, and that this power, 
once trained, can then be turned to use in any field. The 
power of observation is specific. Instead of being content 
to allow the child to observe any material that may be 
available, we must direct the child to observe those things 
which in themselves are worth observing on account of the 
relation which they bear to his life. If there seem to be in 
nature some things which the child should observe, then 
specific training in the observations of these particular 
objects should be given.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
METHODS OF TEACHING SCIENCE 45 
Thus, in the first place, a very careful selection of topics 
is necessary. Furthermore, having decided on the objects 
worth observing, it will not suffice merely to have the child 
observe anything and everything about the object in ques- 
tion, but he should be led to observe those features which 
are worth observing. Thus, there is necessitated not only a 
careful selection of topics, but also a careful selection of 
the line of observation to be followed. 
The relation which these things bear to the child’s life 
may be taken as the basis for this selection. The child 
should see that the work is related to something that inter- 
ests him, and so is worth while. The observation should be 
guided by specific, clear-cut problems within the child’s 
comprehension, which in themselves suggest and limit the 
points to be studied. The amount of observation called for 
will depend upon the nature of the problem. In some cases 
it may be an important factor; in others it may play but a 
minor part. 
Elimination of worthless observation. Just at the present 
time one of the needs in science teaching is the elimination 
of much worthless observation of insignificant details that 
have no meaning. For instance, one type of lesson is to 
take some material, such as a flower, and have the chil- 
dren make all possible observations on it without any 
special purpose, except that the children see all they can 
about the flower. This seems to be a sort of simplified form 
of the analysis blanks formerly used so much in high-school 
botany, on which were recorded in tiresome details a great 
mass of meaningless observations. 
Observation for its own sake cannot be justified as an 
aim of science teaching. This narrow conception has helped 
to bring the subject into disrepute, and has sometimes been 
the cause of an apparent conflict between agriculture and 
nature-study. Observation is not an end in itself, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
simply a means to an end. The introduction of this new 
method of study was such a radical departure from the 
method in common use that it is not to be wondered at that 
for a while undue emphasis was laid upon it. It should now 
be given its proper place as secondary to, and controlled 
by, some large aim expressed in terms that interest the child. 
The effect of applying the suggestions here given might 
seem to lessen the importance attached to observation, but 
it would give a more rational and symmetrical perspective to 
the whole subject of science. Too often the work in science 
has consisted merely of aimless observation alone, and the 
work has stopped there, whereas this should be but the 
starting-point. Observation is simply a means of gathering 
the raw material which is to be used, and the chief value 
of observation consists in the fact that it constitutes an 
effective way of gathering this material, quite different from 
the book method used in most school subjects. But the 
work should be organized around a vital problem and 
carried through to some real issue. A science lesson which 
consists of observation alone may be quite as deficient as 
one in which observation forms no part. It is not the 
writer’s intention to minimize the value of observation, but 
simply to attempt to point out its true place, and to hint 
at some of the larger and more vital problems which are 
possible in teaching science.

CHAPTER VI 
TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 
Motivation of bird-study. Bird-study is a topic that is 
easily and naturally motivated. Birds are a common and 
noticeable form of life in the child’s environment. One of 
the first motives appealed to is the desire to know the names 
of these common birds. The identification of birds may form 
an important part of the work in the primary grades. The 
bright colors of many of our birds and the activities of bird 
life make a combination that appeals strongly to children. 
After a child has once begun to notice bird life the interest 
naturally grows. 
The manual activities involved in building bird-houses are 
other features that appeal to children. The older children 
are interested in the practical value that birds are to man, 
so that their economic value may be studied in the upper 
grades. Children of all ages are interested in the formation 
of bird clubs for the study and protection of birds. They 
are interested in reporting observations they have made 
on birds. A spring calendar is an excellent means for 
stimulating these observations. The teacher should encour- 
age these observations and give opportunities for reports 
to be made to the class. In the autumn a collection of 
nests may be made for the school. Many of the lessons 
taught in the schoolroom may furnish topics for conver- 
sation at home. The older children may be encouraged to 
cut out clippings relating to birds from magazines and 
papers, and to bring them to school to put on a bulletin 
board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Materials for bird-study. The best and final thing for the 
child to study is the living bird outdoors. For the school- 
room lessons some material is needed to create an interest 
which shall lead the child to this outdoor study. In most 
schools mounted birds cannot be obtained, and it is ques- 
tionable whether these would be desirable, especially for 
young children. As an introduction to bird-study sometimes 
it may be possible to keep a pet canary in the schoolroom 
for a few days. 
Pictures. There is a substitute for mounted birds that 
can be used, which serves the purpose exceptionally well, 
namely, colored pictures. Very good pictures can now be 
obtained from the following sources: — 
1. National Association of Audubon Societies, 
1974 Broadway, New York City. 
About ninety pictures have been published, to which 
six are being added each year. The price is two cents 
apiece, including, besides the picture, an outline draw- 
ing and a four-page pamphlet descriptive of the bird’s 
habits. On application to the above address a list of 
pictures for sale will be furnished. The Association 
has recently published the Audubon pocket bird col- 
lection. This is a folded card, about nine by seven 
inches, containing small colored pictures of birds. It 
is easily carried in the field and makes a ready means 
of naming birds. Case number 1 contains sixty-three 
pictures of winter birds of the Eastern United States. 
Case number 2 contains eighty-two pictures of birds 
common in the Southeastern States. Case number 3 
contains seventy-four figures of March and April mi- 
grants of Eastern United States. Case number 4 
contains eighty-four figures of the common winter 
birds of the Western United States. The price is ten 
cents for each case.
-P-A-G-E-61
  TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 51 
2. G. P. Browne Company, 
Beverly, Massachusetts. 
About three hundred and fifty pictures have been 
published. The price is two cents each. These may be 
obtained on light-weight mounts for four cents each. 
3. Massachusetts Audubon Society, 
66 Newbury Street, Boston. 
This society sells pictures mounted as charts. There 
are three charts, known as the “ Audubon Bird Charts,” 
twenty-seven by forty-two inches, arranged so that 
they can be hung in the schoolroom. Charts Numbers 
1 and 2 each contain twenty-six common birds, and 
Chart Number 3, twenty winter birds. The price of 
each chart is $1.50. 
4, The Bureau of Biological Survey has issued a large 
poster on the feeding of winter birds. This may be 
obtained free on application to the Bureau at Wash- 
ington, D.C. 
Hand work. For young children it is important that a 
large amount of hand work should be provided, as children 
acquire knowledge faster by this means. Colored pictures 
furnish material for this kind of work. The children are 
given outlines and, with the colored pictures before them, 
color in the outline, using either colored crayons or water- 
colors. The outlines may be obtained in two ways: first, 
the teacher, by means of a mimeograph or other device, 
may make enough outlines to supply the class; second, the 
children may make the outlines themselves. The older 
children may make free-hand drawings of the outline from 
the picture. 
The younger children may trace the outlines. For this 
purpose two grades of paper are needed, the ordinary 
drawing-paper on which the final outline is to be colored, 
and some paper thin enough for tracing; thin typewriting 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
paper will do. The paper is held over the picture and the 
outline of the bird traced. When this is finished it is turned 
over and placed on the ordinary drawing-paper with the 
outline next to it. The child takes his pencil and marks 
back and forth a number of times across the paper, just 
over the outline already drawn. This causes enough of the 
pencil mark to be rubbed off to reproduce the outline on 
the second paper. The child may go over this outline with 
a pencil to make it clear, and then color it. Free-hand out- 
lines of birds may be cut from paper or cardboard, and then 
colored on both sides with crayons. These may be suspended 
by means of thread to represent flying birds. 
The purpose of this work is to enable the children to 
identify the birds in the field more easily, because they have 
noted the colors and their location, and they should be 
encouraged to look for these birds. If this hand work 
stops in the schoolroom without leading to the study of 
birds outdoors, it may be questioned whether it is worth 
while. 
Bird calendar. A spring bird calendar is a source of never- 
failing interest, beginning even with the very youngest 
children and extending up through the grades. A calendar 
may best be kept on a large piece of heavy paper or card- 
board. At the top should be some artistic decoration appro- 
priate to the subject. For the young children the reports 
may be arranged in four columns: — 
  
Name of bird | Name of child first reporting | Date first seen | Where seen 
For the older children the following columns may be 
added: —
-P-A-G-E-63
  TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 53 
Date when abundant Date when nesting Remarks 
  
The competitive element suggested in having the child’s 
name appear on the calendar stimulates the children and 
arouses much interest. Several precautions will need to be 
observed by the teacher. Children will often report very 
positively the appearance of a bird a month before it is due 
to arrive. If the teacher has access to a local calendar kept 
by some bird-student, it will help her in knowing when to 
expect certain birds. The migration dates for several locali- 
ties in the Eastern United States are given in Chapman’s 
Handbook of Birds. If the children report birds several 
weeks ahead of the dates given on some reliable migration 
record, probably they have made a mistake, and they 
should be told so by the teacher. 
After it is probable that the bird has arrived, it must be 
understood by the class that no bird’s name is to go down 
on the calender till the child has given such a good descrip- 
tion of the bird that there is no doubt about its being seen. 
In case of doubt the name should not be put down. 
Bird games. The game element may profitably be intro- 
duced into bird-study, especially with young children. Fol- 
lowing are some games which the author has seen used that 
help the ch'ld in describing and identifying birds: — 
Games with colored pictures. Game Number 1. The 
teacher shows the pictures one at a time to the children, 
keeping the name covered. The child who first correctly 
names the bird takes the picture. The child who has the 
most pictures at the end of the game wins. 
Game Number 2. This may be used with older children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  
54 ‘THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
A large number of pictures are hung around the room and 
numbered, the names being covered. Each child writes the 
list of numbers on a piece of paper, and opposite the number 
the name of the bird. The child who names the most wins. 
Game Number 3. The teacher pins the picture of some 
bird on a child’s back and shows the picture to the class. 
The child stands before the class and asks questions of any 
one he wishes about the bird, till he guesses it correctly. 
He then names some one else to take his place. 
Game Number 4. The pictures are placed on a table or 
stood on the blackboard railing, with the names covered. 
The children are asked in turn to pick out the picture of a 
certain bird. The child who picks out the most correctly 
wins. 
Game Number 5. A child stands before the class with a 
collection of pictures, the names being covered. He names 
them one at a time till he makes a mistake. The child who 
first corrects the mistake then takes his turn in naming the 
pictures. 
Game Number 6. The names of birds are written on 
separate slips of paper, and these are placed on the edge of 
the blackboard. The pictures of the birds are placed on the 
table with the names covered. The children are asked to 
pick out a picture and place it beside its name. The purpose 
of the game is to see which child can match the largest 
number of pictures and slips. 
Games without pictures. Game Number 7. A child stands 
before the class and describes some bird which he has in 
mind. The children try to guess the bird from the descrip- 
tion. The child who first guesses it correctly then begins 
the description of another bird. 
Game Number 8. This is a slight modification of the 
previous game. A child stands before the class and has 
some particular bird in mind. The children take turns in
-P-A-G-E-65
  
TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 55 
asking questions about the bird, its color, size, etc., till some 
one guesses the bird. This child then takes his turn in 
answering questions about some other bird. 
Dramatization. Children enjoy dramatization and learn 
much thereby. Some simple bird play could easily be ar- 
ranged and the parts taken by the children. The Liberty 
Bell Bird Club has arranged three plays: The Workers, The 
Bird’s Return, and The Birds’ House-Hunting, which may 
be obtained of the Farm Journal, Philadelphia, for three 
two-cent stamps each. Probably Percy MacKaye’s Sanc- 
tuary could be adapted for grammar grades. ~ 
Bird clubs. Much enthusiasm can be aroused by the 
organization of bird clubs. A local bird club can be formed 
anywhere, but more interest will be aroused if this is formed 
in connection with some large organization. There are at 
least two ways in which this can be done. One is through 
the National Association of Audubon Societies. Each child 
who wishes to join pays ten cents. The names are sent by 
the teacher to New York City to the Association at 1974 
Broadway. Each child receives in return eight colored bird 
pictures, the Audubon pocket bird collection, and an Au- 
dubon button, which has on it a picture of the robin and 
the words “Audubon Society.” If there are fifteen or 
more members, the teacher receives Bird-Lore for one 
year. 
Another means is through the Liberty Bell Bird Club of 
the Farm Journal, Philadelphia. The following pledge is 
written at the top of a sheet of paper, and the children who 
wish to join write their names under this pledge: “I desire 
to become a member of the Liberty Bell Bird Club, and 
promise to study and protect all song and insectivorous 
birds and to do what I can for the club.” 
This list is sent to the Farm Journal at Philadelphia. 
Each child in return receives a little pamphlet, entitled, 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
PES eS EE ls oT ee OE TE SER Ts Cet RS ee ee ae ee ee eee ee ee a ee ae 
56 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Guide of the Liberty Bell Bird Club; he also receives a bird 
button, which has on it a picture of a swallow and of the 
Liberty Bell, and printed across it the motto, “Protect Our 
Feathered Friends,” and around the circumference, “Th 
Liberty Bell Bird Club.” 
The advantage of the first club is that each child receives 
pictures and leaflets which may be used in connection with 
the meetings of the club. The advantage of the second club 
is that no money is required. The teacher can select which- 
ever seems best suited to the locality where she is teaching. 
Except with the very young children it is well to elect 
officers and to allow the children to assume the chief respon- 
sibility for the work of the club under the supervision of the 
teacher. 
There is a great variety of things that may be done at the 
meetings of the club. If the colored plates are used the 
children may color some of the outlines. Any one of these 
birds may be taken as the topic of the meeting, and the 
pamphlet and other references studied in preparation, dif- 
ferent children being assigned topics to look up. About a 
week before the meeting the bird to be studied should be 
announced, so that the children may be watching the birds 
outdoors and report what they have seen. A meeting may 
be held to discuss the making of bird-houses, and at another 
meeting these may be brought together and compared. A 
number of field trips should be taken to study the birds 
out of doors. All of the above can best be done in the 
spring. In the autumn nests may be collected and studied. 
In the winter the subject of winter feeding may be taken 
up. 
What bird clubs may do. From a number of letters pub- 
lished in Bird-Lore explaining about the work of the clubs, 
the following list is taken of the things which were done by 
the various clubs: —

Seventh. Work outlined by teacher or director for the following 
week. 
Eighth. Adjournment. 
In many cases enough interést is aroused so that the 
members of the club meet during the summer vacation at 
the homes of the members. 
The child’s activities. One of the most effective phases 
of nature-study is that which calls into play the manual ac- 
tivities of the child in providing opportunities himself for 
making a study of the life about him. Bird-study is es- 
pecially well adapted to make use of these activities in 
building nesting-houses, in feeding the winter birds, and in 
providing fountains. The very fact that the child is doing 
something for the birds is a means of developing that 
helpful sympathy with nature which may prove such an 
important factor in all his subsequent life. And, further- 
more, excellent opportunity is given for watching the birds 
that may come in response to the attractions offered. 
These observations will be carried on with much greater 
ardor and thoroughness because the child has himself helped 
to furnish the conditions which make his observations 
possible. 
Nesting-houses. Perhaps there is no one line of work that 
interests the children so much as the making of bird-houses, 
especially in the primary and intermediate grades. Even 
very young children are interested, and when they are too 
small to make the houses themselves, some one of the 
family at home may help them. The houses can be built} 
at home or in the manual-training department. Children! 
may be asked to bring materials, and then some one may| 
help them in the manual-training shops. Many children| 
will be interested to the point where they will make houses| 
at home. As an added incentive they may be asked to brin; 
their houses to school on a certain day, so that a picture of    
   
   
                                
    
          
  
-P-A-G-E-69
TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 59 
the children with their houses may be taken. The problems 
which arise in connection with the construction and location 
of bird-houses should be talked over with the children and 
the important precautions to be observed explained to 
them. The really essential features having been made clear, 
the children should be allowed to use their ingenuity and 
individuality about arranging details. 
Tf the school building is favorably situated, houses may 
be put up in the school yard. If these are occupied oppor- 
tunity will be given the school for bird-study at close range. 
It would be well worth while to see if the park boards would 
not codperate with the schools, so that the children might 
make bird-houses and place them in the parks. Such a plan 
was carried out in Jackson and Washington Parks, Chicago, 
where the children made several hundred wren and blue 
bird houses. 
Difficulties. The children should understand the difficul- 
ties to be met, so as to avoid undue disappointment, and 
should be prepared to overcome them as far as possible. 
The greatest obstacle of all is the English sparrow. One of 
the most effective devices for keeping this bird out of the 
nesting-boxes is to make the hole so small that the sparrows 
cannot enter, but large enough for the wren and the chick- 
adee. With houses for blue birds and tree swallows, prob- 
ably the most effective thing which the children can do is 
to make the houses so that the tops can be easily lifted, and 
then to remove the sparrows’ eggs once a week or as fast as 
they are laid. This often causes the sparrows to leave the 
nesting-house. If nothing else can be done the entrance can 
be covered or the house taken down as soon as it is evident 
that no other bird is going to use it. This will prevent the 
sparrows from rearing their young. Of course, killing the 
sparrows cannot be recommended to children. Whatever is 
done along this line must be left to adults.   
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Feeding the winter birds. The introductory work of feed- 
ing the winter birds should be done in the late fall. A 
talk on the food of birds may be given, so as to bring out 
the two classes of foods, animal and vegetable. The kinds 
of food to put out and the methods of putting it out may be 
discussed. The necessity of providing a constant supply of 
food should be emphasized, and also of seeing that there is 
a good supply immediately after a snowstorm. The children 
may occasionally be reminded of the feeding so that they 
will not neglect it too long. The possibility of taming the 
birds to feed from the hand should be brought to the chil- 
dren’s attention. The construction of winter-feeding devices 
may be made a part of the manual-training work. While 
the children are being encouraged to feed the birds at home, 
a lunch-counter may be provided in the school yard, if the 
conditions will allow it. Committees may be appointed 
among the children to see that the counter is provided with 
food. 
Field trips. There is but one way to know the birds, and 
that is to study them in the field. In the schoolroom the 
children may be prepared for field studies, and may learn 
about the value of the birds and how to protect them, but 
without a knowledge of the birds themselves enthusiasm 
will be lacking. 
The ordinary class of thirty to forty children is too large 
for the teacher to attempt a field trip with them all, but 
frequently some arrangement may be made with the prin-| 
cipal by which half of the class may be taken at one time. 
Sometimes walks may be taken with a few children who are} 
especially interested. 
Both teacher and children should start out with a ve 
definite purpose in mind. The teacher should prepare an 
plan for the trip very carefully. One purpose may be to 
how many kinds of birds can be identified, and to make     
    
        
   
       
   
      
   
   
  
-P-A-G-E-71
  TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 61 
list of them. Another purpose may be to make a special 
study of one or two kinds of birds, noting the size, general 
colors, song, nesting-habits, and methods of locomotion. 
Whether ficld trips with the children are taken or not, 
the teacher should constantly encourage the children, when 
by themselves as they pass to and from school and when at 
home, to study the birds and report their observations to 
the class. 
One of the chief purposes of the field trips taken by the 
teacher with the children is to stimulate them to observe 
birds when by themselves. 
Bird Day. Bird Day is observed often in connection with 
Arbor Day. Bird Day is now officially recognized in nine 
States. In observing this day one special feature to be em- 
phasized is doing something for the birds, such as putting 
up houses at home or in the school yard. The program 
should not be so formal as to obliterate this important 
feature. 
The following are suggestions for a few general lines 
of work that may be carried on: — 
. Reading of proclamation. 
Talk by some one outside of the schools. 
Talk by teacher. 
Original essays by children. 
Reports on outdoor observations. 
Recitations and readings. 
Dramatic presentation. 
Songs. 
. Putting up bird-houses and planting shrubs in school yard 
to attract birds.

Correlation with other subjects. Bird-study may do 
uch to aid other lines of school work and may also itself 
made more interesting by proper correlation. Many 
portunities present themselves in connection with several
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
subjects, especially with art and literature. The children 
may make outlines of birds and color them, as explained in 
previous pages, and the older children may paint the birds 
free-hand with water-colors. The children may help make 
artistic decorations for the bird calendar. A large amoun’ 
of splendid literature has been written, and this should forn 
an important part of the work with birds. 
Arithmetic and bird-study. Some problems in arithmetic 
relating to the number of insects eaten by birds, the number 
of birds, and other topics may be given the children. A few 
are here suggested: — 
A. Problems on the number of insects eaten by nestlings. 
1. A pair of wrens were observed to feed their young 17 times 
in an hour. The parents fed their young from 5 A.M. 
till 8 p.m., and the young remained in the nest 15 days. 
Assuming that one insect was brought at each visit, how 
many insects were destroyed by this brood of wrens? 
2. Many birds on the average feed their young about 200 
times a day, and the young stay in the nest about two 
weeks. After the leaves have fallen, count the number of 
nests in a certain area and then estimate the number of 
insects that have been destroyed by the birds reared in 
these nests, assuming one insect brought at each feeding. 
B. Problems on amount of food eaten by adult birds. 
1. A study made of owls during the winter months showed 
that they destroyed 2 mice a day. It has been estimated 
that each mouse does damage to the extent of 2 cents each 
year. How much is an owl worth a year? 
2. A study made by the Biological Survey of the red-shoul- 
dered hawk showed that out of 214 birds, 3 had eaten 
poultry and 102 had eaten mice. What per cent of the 
birds had eaten poultry and what per cent mice? 
C. Problems on the number of birds. 
1. A census made of birds in the eastern United States 
showed that there was an average of 6 pairs of robins to 
each farm of 58 acres. There are about 4,000,000 farms 
east of the Mississippi, averaging 93 acres each. How
-P-A-G-E-73
  TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT BIRDS 63 
many robins are there on the farms east of the Mississippi 
River? 
2. This census also showed that for every 100 robins there 
were 83 English sparrows, 49 catbirds, 37 brown thrashers, 
28 house wrens, 27 kingbirds, and 26 bluebirds. How 
many individuals of each kind of birds are there on the 
farms east of the Mississippi River? 
8. This census also showed that there was an average of one 
pair of birds per acre. How many birds are there altogether 
on the farms east of the Mississippi River? 
D. Problems on migration. 
1. The robin as a species travels from Iowa to Alaska, a dis- 
tance of 3000 miles, in 78 days. How many miles does the 
robin average to travel in a day? 
E. Miscellaneous problems. 
1. A study of hawks made by the United States Department 
of Agriculture showed that 5 kinds were harmful, 7 kinds 
were neutral, and 35 kinds were beneficial. What per 
cent of the hawks respectively are harmful, neutral, and 
beneficial? 
Seasons and grades. Most of the bird work should be 
done in the spring, excepting a few lessons in the winter on 
winter birds and their feeding. There is something of inter- 
est about birds for every grade. The younger children are 
interested especially in the bright colors and in learning the 
names of birds. The children in the intermediate grades are 
interested in the same things, but in addition they show a 
great interest in the manual activities involved in building 
bird-houses. They begin to show some appreciation of the 
economic value of birds. In the grammar grades this eco- 
nomic aspect may be strongly puip resized together with 
the subject of bird protection. 
The following brief outline suggests the distribution of 
a few topics according to grades and seasons. More de-

CHAPTER VII 
TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT INSECTS 
Motivation. Children need a series of specific aims that 
shall serve to motivate their work. These aims must be 
sought in the part that insects play in the child’s life. In- 
sects are the most abundant form of life in the child’s 
environment. He sees them at every turn. His first interest 
then is to become familiar with a few of the common forms, 
and to learn something of their life activities, how they eat, 
breathe, and move. Another point of contact is through 
flowers. He is naturally curious to know what the insects 
are doing there. 
The child’s gardening experiences form another avenue 
of approach. A great variety of insects are found in the 
garden. The child wishes to know what relation these 
insects bear to his garden. In some cases he can see the 
harm they do, and he wishes to know how to control them. 
In the case of beneficial insects the relation is not so self- 
evident. And then finally such pests as the fly and the 
mosquito are abundant everywhere, and the child is inter- 
ested to know the harm they do and what he can do to 
control them. 
The thought of using what one learns is a very important 
factor in motivation. The best kind of problem is one which 
from its very nature suggests the doing of something. The 
application for the study of common insects and their 
activities is to find these insects and observe them in their 
natural environment. The application of studies of injurious 
insects is to observe their activities and the harm done and 
to apply the remedies to control them. If a child is too
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE | 
| 
young to take an active part in the work against injurious 
insects, he may observe what other people are doing. The 
application of the study of beneficial insects is to recognize 
some of the more common forms when one sees them, and 
to observe the good they do. 
The children may make collections of those insects which 
are shown to bear a close relation to their life. The home 
and school life may be brought together by having the child 
talk over these topics at home. The older pupils may watch 
newspapers and magazines for clippings regarding insects. 
Materials (cages for living insects). Living insects are 
easily kept in the schoolroom in some simple apparatus pro- 
vided for this purpose. One of the simplest outfits is a glass 
canning-jar or tumbler, with netting tied over the top. 
Another simple form is made by cutting a large hole in the 
cover and bottom of a shoe-box, and covering these holes 
with mosquito netting. A string is tied around the box to 
keep the cover on and the box set on edge; or a hole may be 
cut in the cover alone. This has the advantage of conven- 
ience in that the cover may be easily removed in order to 
feed the insects. 
A chalk-box or cigar-box may be used and covered with 
a pane of glass. A very satisfactory combination is to fill a | 
flower-pot with sand and to place on this a Jantern globe 
with a piece of mosquito netting fastened on top, or a pane 
of glass placed across. 
The cage must be kept clean, and the insects given fresh 
food every day. Sometimes moist dirt or a sod may be kept 
on the bottom of the cage. The grass in the sod will furnish 
food for some insects. When possible they should be given 
the same kind of food as that upon which they are found. 
If one does not know the food of the insect, grass and various 
kinds of leaves, such as cherry, may be tried. Clusters of 
leaves may be kept moist by placing the stems in a bottle 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT INSECTS 71 
filled with moist sand, or with water if the mouth is filled so 
full that the insects cannot creep into the water. 
A great variety of insects may be kept in these cages, 
such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, galls, and the 
various insects found in the garden. Water insects may be 
kept in a jar filled with water. 
Insect nets. For collecting butterflies, dragon-flies, and 
other swiftly flying insects a net is necessary. One can 
easily be made by the children. Procure an old broom 
handle and a piece of stiff wire about four feet long. Bend 
this in the form of a circle about a foot in diameter, crossing 
the wires about six inches from the ends. Give them two 
firm twists. Bend each wire at right angles, about a half- 
inch from the twist, so that the two ends extend parallel 
about one inch apart. Place these two wires over one end 
of the broom handle and fasten one on each side of the handle 
by means of wire or heavy string. 
Around the wire stitch a narrow border of sheeting, two 
or three inches wide. Make a net about thirty inches long 
out of cotton tulle or light cheesecloth. Sew this into a round 
bag at the bottom and attach the top to the border of the 
cloth on the wire. Mosquito netting may be used, but it is 
easily torn. The net should be at least twice as long as the 
diameter of the wire, so that when insects are caught in it, 
they may be imprisoned by a quick turn of the handle. One 
way to collect insects is to beat the top of grass back and 
forth with the net, when one will catch many insects that 
had not previously been seen. 
Collections. The older children may make insect collec- 
tions. For this purpose a cyanide bottle is needed for killing 
the insects, and some device for mounting them. The author 
believes that the best plan for school use is the one described 
in chapter IV of Hodge’s Nature-Study and Life, to which 
the reader is referred.
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Calendar. One way of stimulating the observation of the 
children is to keep an insect calendar in the spring. In its 
simplest form it may consist of the following columns: — 
  
Name of insest Date first seen Child first reporting 
  
  
If desired, other points may be added, such as place 
where seen, date when abundant, and kind of food. 
Correlation (arithmetic). Insect study may be correlated 
with arithmetic, drawing, and literature. The following are 
given as suggesting the possibilities of insect problems: — 
1. A mosquito lays about 200 eggs, and under favorable condi- 
tions these may develop into adult mosquitoes in 10 days. If 
one half of these eggs develop into females, each of which lays 
200 eggs, how many mosquitoes would there be at the end 
of a month if all lived? 
2. A young American silkworm of the polyphemus moth which 
had just hatched was weighed and found to weigh one twen- 
tieth of a grain; when 30 days old, 31 grains; when 56 days 
old, 207 grains. How many times its first weight was its 
weight at each of these days? 
8. During these 56 days it consumed three fourths of a pound 
of leaves. How many times greater was this than its original 
weight? Than its weight when 56 days old? 
4, An average locust weighs about 15 grains and is capable of 
consuming each day its own weight of standing crops, such 
as corn and wheat. Assuming that these crops are worth 
$10 a ton, and that there is 1 grasshopper to every square 
yard, how much damage do the grasshoppers do in a day on 
each acre? How much damage to the wheat and corn crop of 
Minnesota in which State about 7,000,000 acres are planted 
to these crops? 
5. The United States Bureau of Entomology has made the fol- 
lowing estimate of the per cent of damage done to crops by
-P-A-G-E-83

insects. Work out the money loss in the last column for each 
crop and the total: —

6. Bring a grasshopper into the schoolroom. Measure the length 
of its body. Measure the distance and the height the grass- 
hopper jumps. How many times its own length are these 
distances? If a boy could jump as far in proportion to his 
height as a grasshopper, how far and how high could he jump? 
Correlation (art). Paper cuttings may be made of some 
of the larger insects. Colored drawings may be made of 
moths and butterflies, either with crayon or with water- 
colors. Or these may be cut frec-hand first and then colored. 
When cocoons are kept in the room and the moths emerge, 
a good opportunity is afforded for this kind of work. Charts 
may be made of pictures and the children’s own work in 
illustrating insect groups. The older children may make 
outline drawings of the insects studied, and paint the but- 
terflies and moths in water-colors. 
Grades and seasons. There is something of interest about 
insects for every grade, so that the study may extend all 
the way through the grades. The best time for most of the 
insect study is the autumn, because insect life is so abun- 
dant at that time. The study of the fly and mosquito may 
be taken up in the spring, because this is the best time to 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
Seon tee er rennet hoe ie 
74 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE | 
take measures to control them. If collections of materials 
are made in the autumn, such studies as cocoons, galls, and 
wasp’s nests may be taken up in the winter. 
The following brief outline suggests the work adapted 
to the different grades and seasons. Detailed suggestions 
are found in the outline at the end of the book: —

In the late winter or early spring start a campaign of trapping 
the early flies. Send five cents in stamps for a fly-trap pattern to the 
International Harvester Company, Harvester Building, Chicago, 
Illinois. This gives detailed directions for making a fly-trap so that 
a child can do it. For fifty cents there may be obtained from the 
same company a set of about ten stencils, three feet square, of the 
house-fly, giving drawings that may be reproduced on the black- 
board, on paper, or on cloth, which may be kept as permanent 
charts. Directions accompany these stencils showing the use that 
can be made of them.

CHAPTER VIII 
PETS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS (FOR PRIMARY 
GRADES) 
‘Tue care of a pet is a splendid experience that every 
child should have. In caring for his pet he develops a sense 
of responsibility and the need of doing certain things at 
regular times. Through this care he comes to develop a 
friendly feeling for bis pet and this gives him a more thought- 
ful feeling toward all animal life. And finally the child 
derives much pleasure from association with his pets through 
play and other means. 
The studies made of pets may be carried on in two places; 
at home and in the schoolroom. Pets may be kept in a cage 
in the schoolroom where their habits may be studied, and 
points may be given for the children to observe in their 
pets at home. Such pets as the dog and the cat may be 
brought each day when needed, by the various children for 
a day only. Such pets as the rabbit and the squirrel may be 
kept in a cage in the schoolroom for several weeks. A cage 
may easily be made from a large box and some inch-mesh 
galvanized wire netting. This is better than mosquito net- 
ting. Some sawdust or dry dirt may be spread on the bot: 
tom of the cage. In order to avoid offensive odors, the ani- 
mals should be fed on dry foods such as oats, corn, bread — 
crust, nuts, and an occasional piece of some green stuff such 
as grass or lettuce. A pan of drinking-water should be kept 
in the cage. The cage should be kept clean. Another pet 
that can easily be kept in the schoolroom is the canary. 
In connection with the study of the cat the children should  
-P-A-G-E-93
  PETS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS 83 
be taught how they can care for their cat so as to lessen as 
far as possible the harm it does in killing birds. Most of this 
harm is done to young birds in the spring and early sum- 
mer, during the nesting season. Hence children should be 
taught to take special care of their cats during this season. 
The most harm is done during the early morning. During 
the nesting season of birds, cats should be shut up, espe- 
cially at night and during the early morning; and at all 
times should be well fed, so that they will not have hunger 
added to their natural instinct as a stimulus to catch birds. 
The children should be taught that it is a cruel thing to the 
eat to abandon it when leaving their summer homes as so

  CHAPTER IX 
LESSONS ON TREES 
Motivation of tree-study. In many ways trees are the 
most satisfactory topics to take up in nature-study. They 
are common, large, beautiful, easy of access, always avail- 
able all the year round, and they pass through an interest- 
ing series of changes from season to season. The children 
have many interesting experiences with trees which serve 
as a foundation for the work to be done. Trees furnish 
shade in the hot weather, the tree is the center of the Christ- 
mas festivities, in the autumn children play in the fallen 
leaves, they like to climb trees and build houses in their 
branches, and in the autumn they go nutting. The boys in 
manual training enjoy the use of tools with wood. All these 
activities furnish an abundance of experiences with which 
the school work can be linked. 
Children delight in bright colors, and in the autumn work 
with the colored leaves appeals strongly to the young chil- 
dren. The desire to know the names of the trees is present. 
The collecting instinct may be appealed to throughout 
all the grades in collecting leaves or specimens of woods. 
Many games with leaves may be devised for the primary 
grades, as suggested on page 92. 
The use of these lessons in the child’s life may be sug- 
gested by encouraging him to find growing outdoors the 
trees studied, and to bring leaves to the class or to report 
where the tree was seen growing. A map may be made of a 
certain section near the school and all the trees growing 
there marked on it and named. The children may be asked 
to observe the shade trees to see if they are receiving proper 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
LESSONS ON TREES 89 
attention, with reference to pruning and protection. They 
may be encouraged to talk over the topic of the lesson with 
their parents and friends, and report what they learn. The 
older children may be asked to watch the newspapers and 
magazines for references to forest fires, and other items 
regarding trees and forests. These clippings may be cut 
out and brought to school and posted in an area reserved 
for this purpose. 
Materials. A great abundance of material may easily be 
obtained. In the autumn, when the leaves begin to fall, they 
may be secured in sufficient quantities to supply each pupil 
with material. At this same season many fruits of trees, 
such as acorns and nuts, can be obtained. During and just 
after the Christmas season branches of various kinds of 
evergreens may be secured. During the winter twigs of 
trees may be brought into the schoolroom. In the early 
spring twigs may be brought indoors and forced to develop 
earlier by placing in water. It is well to cut off about a half- 
inch from the lower end of the twigs every week or two. 
The best twigs to select for this purpose are those that open 
quickly and have large parts, such as the horse-chestnut, 
lilac, pussy-willow, and fruit trees. In the spring flowers of 
trees may be secured. Those which have conspicuous flow- 
ers, such as fruit trees, locusts, horse-chestnut, and catalpa, 
are better adapted for this purpose for the primary grades. 
For the older children the less conspicuous flowers of other 
trees may be obtained. The fruits of the elms and white 
and red maples may be obtained during the spring term. 
Collections. Children are interested in making collec- 
tions. One may be made showing how trees scatter seeds. 
In the grammar grades collections can be made of the 
different kinds of woods used in carpentry, and of small 
limbs of trees from one to two inches in diameter. These 
specimens may be neatly cut up into uniform sizes, and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
cut surfaces polished to show the structure. Cuts may be 
made to show cross, tangential, and radial sections. These 
specimens may be kept loose or mounted in a frame. 
Collections of leaves. Collections of leaves are easily 
made, and the gathering and labeling of the specimens lead 
to identification of the trees. These collections may be 
made in three ways: first, by pressing and mounting the 
leaves; second, by waxing and ironing the leaves; third, by 
making blue prints. The fall is the best time to make these 
collections, as the leaves may be gathered when they begin 
to show their autumn colors. 
Pressing leaves. In order to press the leaves secure two 
pieces of board about a foot long and eight or nine inches 
wide, old newspapers, and a heavy weight, such as a stone. 
The leaves are placed between the folds of a newspaper, 
several leaves to one piece. These papers are put one on 
top of the other with extra folds of paper between, so as to 
absorb the moisture. This pile of papers is arranged on one 
of the boards, the other board is set on top, and on this 
is placed a stone. This is allowed to stand for a week or two. 
For a still simpler method the leaves may be laid between 
the leaves of an old book and a weight set on the book. 
The leaves may be mounted on unruled notebook paper by 
means of glue or gummed paper. 
An interesting project for the older children is to collect 
the leaves of all the deciduous trees in the locality and make 
an exhibit, to which the friends and parents of the children 
are invited. The children may be divided into groups, and 
each group assigned a certain family of trees to collect; such 
as the maples, the elms, the oaks, the birches, the willows, 
the poplars, the ashes, the nut trees, the locusts, and a few 
trees will be left which may be placed in a miscellaneous 
group. These leaves may be pressed and mounted as ex- 
plained above. The fruits may also be collected. The chil-
-P-A-G-E-101
  LESSONS ON TREES 91 
dren may be asked to look up interesting facts about the 
group of trees they are collecting, so that they may be able 
to answer questions and give explanations at the exhibit. 
Wawing leaves. The autumn colors are best preserved 
by waxing the leaves. Scatter over the leaf small bits of 
wax or paraffin, then pass over these a moderately hot iron. 
Treat the other side in the same way. The leaves may also 
be dipped in melted paraffin. Still better is to cover them 
lightly with melted paraffin, using a small soft brush. The 
leaves may then be mounted on paper with glue. 
Blue prints. A collection of blue prints of leaves is very 
attractive. These prints are easily made and show not only 
the outline, but sometimes the veining, of the leaf. A blue 
print is put ona piece of cardboard, the leaf is arranged on 
this, and a piece of glass placed over all. These are held in 
position by clips or by the hand and exposed to the bright sun 
till thg paper turns to a bronze shade. This is then washed 
in running water or several changes of water and then dried. 
Calendars. Calendars are a means of arousing the chil- 
dren’s interest and of stimulating their observations of 
trees. A large piece of cardboard may be used for these 
calendars. Each one should have some artistic decoration 
suggestive of the topic to be recorded. These may be kept 
in both the spring and fall. In the spring two kinds may be 
kept as the buds open, one of the first appearance of the 
leaves, and another of the first appearance of the flowers. 
These may be kept in a form like the following: — 
  
Flower calendar of trees

-P-A-G-E-102
  92 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
  
Leaf calendar of trees 
  
Location of Name of child Name of tree Date first leaf seen a first reporting 
  
  
In the autumn two calendars may be kept, one of the 
coloring of the leaves, and one of their fall: — 
  
  
  
  
  
  Calendar of leaf-coloring 
Date first Colors Location of | Name of child 
Name of tree colors seen seen tree first reporting 
Calendar of leaf-fall 
Date first te Oe Location of | Name of child Name of tree tea fall all leaves t Hau ers leaves evel lle ree eporting 
  
  
In keeping the last two calendars the children should be 
expected to bring the leaves to school before the record is 
put on the calendar. 
Games. The use of the game element will interest the 
children and may be used as a means to help them identify 
the leaves. The same sort of games may be played with 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
LESSONS ON TREES 93 
leaves as with bird pictures, a list of which is given on 
page 53. 
Arbor Day. In those States where Arbor Day is observed, 
some special program should be arranged. The central idea 
should be the planting of some tree, shrub, or vine; and the 
children should be encouraged to plant something at home. 
The formal exercises may consist of a talk by the teacher or 
by some one outside of the school, reports of the children 
on their observations of trees, original essays by the older 
children, recitations of poems and prose selections about 
trees, and appropriate songs. 
Correlation. Tree-study lends itself admirably to corre- 
lation with other subjects, especially art and literature. In 
the autumn much interesting work can be done with colored 
leaves. The younger children can make free-hand cuttings 
and then color them with crayons. The older children may 
make drawings of leaves or paint them with water-colors. 
Cuttings may be made showing the shape of whole trees. 
Charts may be made showing how trees are cut, how the 
wood gets to us, and the uses made of wood. Blue prints 
may be made of leaves and of the opening buds. The work 
that the children have done for a year showing the trees at 
different seasons may be bound together to form booklets. 
Shapes of trees, nuts, and fruits may be modeled in clay by 
the primary children. 
Grades and seasons. There is something of interest about 
trees for every grade. In the primary grades studies may be 
made of the colored leaves in the autumn and the children 
may be taught to identify a few common trees from their 
leaves, including a few Christmas trees. In the intermediate 
grades the children may be taught to recognize a larger 
number of the common trees, and some study of their uses 
may be made. In the grammar grades special attention may 
be given to the uses of trees and to the subject of forestry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  
94 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Every season has something of interest. In the autumn 
the leaves and fruit may be studied and the coloring and 
fall of the leaf. In the winter evergreens and the bark, 
branching, shape, and twigs of the deciduous trees may 
be studied. In the spring the opening of the buds and 
the flowers found at this time may be noted. The topic 
of forestry may be taken up during any portion of the 
year. 
The following table suggests in a concise form the dis- 
tribution of the topics according to grade and season: —

Series of lessons. A few lessons on trees are suggested 
below in brief outline form. In the study of particular kinds 
of trees one species should be followed through the whole 
year, so as to notice the changes through which it passes: 
the foliage in the early autumn; the leaf-coloring and fall in 
the late autumn; the shape, branching, and bark in the win- 
ter; and the opening buds in the spring.
-P-A-G-E-105
  LESSONS ON TREES 95 
A. Lessons for primary grades 
Autumn LEAVES (FIRST GRADE) 
The first study of trees may well be made with the colored leaves. 
A pile of leaves should be provided illustrating as great a variety 
of colors as possible. 
Have the children group the leaves according to color into sepa- 
rate piles — one for red, one for yellow, one for brown, and one for 
reen. 
The leaves may be grouped again according to the combina- 
tions of colors; those in one pile that have both red and yellow; in 
another pile those that have both yellow and brown and so on. 
The leaves may be grouped according to shape; those of similar 
shape being put in one pile; they may be grouped again according 
to size. 
The children may cut leaves free-hand from paper and then 
color them with crayons, or the coloring may be done without 
cutting. Some of the prettiest leaves may be waxed, as explained 
in a previous part of the chapter. 
Some of the following poems may be read to the children: —

CHAPTER X 
LESSONS WITH FLOWERS 
The study of flowers. There is something about flowers 
that appeals to every one, both young and old. The young 
child is interested in the bright colors and wishes to know 
the names of the flowers. In the primary grades the chief 
thing to emphasize is identification. After a flower is studied 
in the schoolroom the children should be encouraged to find 
the flower growing in its natural environment. Care should 
be taken to see that flowers are not picked needlessly, espe- 
cially the rare ones, some of which are in danger of exter- 
mination in the neighborhood of cities. 
There is one set of flowers to be studied in the spring and 
another set for autumn. Something of interest may be 
found for study in every grade. The purpose of the study 
of flowers should be to acquaint the children with the more 
common forms of wild flowers, so that they may know and 
appreciate them, and thus want to preserve them. The 
older children may be taught something about the economic 
side of pollination. 
Materials. A freshly picked bouquet of the flowers to be 
studied can usually be obtained, so that there will be plenty 
of material for schoolroom use. During the spring a single 
plant of the various flowers studied may be dug up with 
some soil and put in a flower-pot. This may be kept in the 
schoolroom and watered. In this way the whole develop- 
ment of the plant may be followed from the opening bud to 
the fruit. While the children are interested chiefly in the 
flowers of plants, attention should also be called to the leaves 
and fruit of the various plants studied. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  
e 100 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Calendar. The flower calendar is always a means of 
arousing interest and of stimulating outdoor observation on 
the part of the children. A large piece of cardboard should be 
secured, and at the edge or top should be placed some artis- 
tic decoration suggestive of flowers. The cardboard should 
then be ruled off into columns for keeping the records of the 
flowers brought in. The following outline is suggested: — 
  
Flower calendar 
  
Name of child Place where Name of flower | Date brought in Tessar Fama 
  
  
Another way of keeping a calendar is to press and mount 
the flowers as they are brought in, as explained on page 90, 
for the leaves of trees. On each card put the four facts 
called for in the headings given above. These cards may be 
hung on the walls of the room. Both kinds of calendars may 
be kept in either spring or fall. : 
Games. The bird games suggested on page 53 may be 
easily adapted to flower games. For these games a bouquet 
of a number of different kinds of flowers will be needed. 
Another game called “the florist” may be played. Bouquets 
of both wild and cultivated flowers are placed on the desk. 
One child sits at the desk and supposes that he is a florist 
with flowers for sale. The other children in turn come to the 
desk and ask for a certain flower. If the florist gives the 
wrong flower, some other child takes his place. 
Wild-flower garden. If there is a shady corner of the 
yard that is not used, it may be spaded up and made into 
a wild-flower garden. During the spring the roots of vari- 
ous kinds of wild flowers may be dug up and transplanted
-P-A-G-E-111
  LESSONS WITH FLOWERS 101 
into this garden. In a few years a collection of the more 
common flowers may thus be secured in the school yard. 
Correlation. Flower-study lends itself splendidly to cor- 
relation with art. In connection with the science lessons, 
following the study of a flower, the children may draw the 
flowers with colored crayons or paint them with water- 
colors. The best drawing of each flower may be selected 
and put on the wall, and thus a collection may be made of 
the best drawings. 
Blue prints may be made of some of the flowers. These 
will show the outline of the leaves and something of the 
shape and grouping of the flowers. A flower garden may be 
made in the sand table. 
There is a large amount of good literature on flowers, and 
some of the best of these selections may be read in connec- 
tion with the study of the flowers. Flower-study may also 
be correlated with language lessons. Topics about which 
the children are to talk or write may be selected from their 
observation of flowers. 
Series of lessons on flowers 
A. Lessons for primary grades 
GENERAL Stupy or FLrowrrs (AuTUMN) 
Secure a bouquet containing a great variety of flowers. Have 
the children sort the flowers by colors into separate piles, each 
color by itself. When more than one color is found on a flower, 
use the most prominent one for sorting. 
Again have the children sort the flowers into two piles, one con- 
taining the large flowers and the other the small flowers, first select- 
ing some flower for a standard size. 
Sort the flowers into two piles, those that the children know and 
those that they do not know. The names of the unknown flowers 
may be written on slips of paper, and a slip given to each child who 
is asked to pick out this flower. 
Sort the flowers into two piles, those having a distinct odor and 
those having little or no odor.

CHAPTER XI 
SEED-DISPERSAL AND FLOWERLESS PLANTS 
1. Seed-dispersal 
SEED-DISPERSAL is a topic that always appeals to chil- 
dren. Nearly every child has blown on a head of dandelion 
seeds to see if his mother wants him. The material is 
abundant in the autumn, and easy to secure. 
One of the most interesting lines of work is to have col- 
lections made of the various seeds. These may be mounted 
in several ways. One way is to secure from the drug-store 
a number of small vials with stoppers, and place one kind 
of seed in each bottle. These bottles may be mounted on a 
cardboard by means of a piece of elastic, and the names may 
be written on the cardboard beneath the bottle, or a label 
may be pasted on the bottle; or the seeds may be fastened 
directly onto the cardboard by means of glue or mucilage. 
These collections may be class affairs, all the children help- 
ing to furnish seeds for the collections. 
For the younger children the following topics for collec- 
tions are suggested: Seeds that fly. Seeds that steal a ride. 
Seeds scattered by birds. Seeds scattered by the plant itself. 
For the upper grades two central topics may be taken for 
the collections: dispersal of tree seeds and of weed seeds. 
Series of lessons for primary grades 
Toric: SeEps THAT FLY (AUTUMN) 
Materials: Seeds to illustrate the four types of distribution men- 
tioned below; such as milkweed, dandelion, aster, maple, ash,

A separate lesson may be given on the burdock alone, making a 
study of the whole plant. 
2. Flowerless plants 
Mushrooms. Mushrooms have a number of characters 
that make them interesting objects for study; some of them 
are edible, some are brightly colored, there are many differ- 
ent kinds, and they are of wide distribution. They are of 
further interest on account of their method of getting food. 
They cannot make their own food, but get it from other 
plants or animals, either living or dead. 
Their food value has been exaggerated. Their chief value 
is as a food accessory. There is no easy and infallible way 
by which one may separate the edible from the poisonous 
species. The only safe way is to collect only those species 
which are known to be edible and leave the unknown alone, 
if one is collecting for eating. There is no danger in handling 
the poisonous species. Certain kinds of mushrooms, such 
as the coral mushrooms, are all edible, and so may be col- 
lected and eaten without danger. 
Lesson on mushrooms (intermediate grades) 
Materials: Several days before the lesson is to be given, the children 
should be asked to collect all the mushrooms they can and bring 
them to school. Most of the common kinds can be put into one 
of the groups given below. Have spore prints made of several 
species. Cut off the stems near the cap, and place the cap gills 
down on a piece of paper. Cover the whole with a dish and allow 
to stand overnight. The spores will fall down and form a spore 
print on the paper. If it is desired to make permanent prints, 
spread a thin coating of mucilage over the paper, and support 
the cap on each side with matches so that the gills do not touch

may be dug up in the spring and transplanted here. These 
will add to the beauty of the yard and also furnish ma- 
terials for science lessons.

CHAPTER XII 
GARDENING 
The home-garden movement. In recent years there has 
developed in this country a great movement to encourage 
home gardening by children. In some cities the movement 
has been carried on by civic organizations. In other cities 
it has been under the supervision of the schools. This latter 
method seems the better and final solution of the problem, 
because if it is done as a part of the school work it will be- 
come permanently established. In order that the garden 
work should be carried on most effectively, there should be 
some one employed to visit the home gardens during the 
summer and give such help as may be needed. The National 
Bureau of Education is advocating that school boards 
employ one teacher for twelve months, who shall have 
supervision of the home gardens during the summer and 
teach some of the regular school subjects during the rest 
of the year. In some towns the instructor in agriculture in 
the high school supervises the children’s gardens during 
the summer, 
Frequently prizes are offered for the best gardens, or 
pupils are given school credit for the work done in the home 
gardens. But even without a special supervisor much can 
be done on the part of the regular teachers who can seek to 
interest the children and teach the steps necessary to start 
their garden. And if a supervisor is provided, the help of 
the teachers is needed to codperate with her. 
One effective way of getting the children to start a garden 
is to give them a means of buying penny packets of seeds. 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
A number of firms are now selling seeds at this rate to school _ 
children. ; 
Children’s interests in kinds of gardens. Young children 
are more interested in the flower and vegetable gardens than 
in the fruit garden, because the latter requires such a long 
time before any returns are secured, excepting the fall 
strawberry. The relative interest in the flower garden and 
vegetable garden depends on the age and sex of the chil- 
dren. In general, girls are more interested in the flower 
garden, and boys in the vegetable garden; and the younger 
boys are more interested in the flower garden than are the 
older boys. The financial side of the vegetable garden 
appeals quite strongly, however, to all children. In many 
portions of the country girls’ clubs are being formed for the 
raising and canning of vegetables. 
Value of gardening. Every child should have some ex- 
perience in gardening. It teaches children many valuable 
lessons. Dr. Hodge has well said: “The vandalism, juvenile 
and even adult, that renders pursuit of horticulture in a 
New England city or town well-nigh impossible, must be 
accounted a first fruit of this universal neglect” of the study 
of gardening in the schools. 
A large amount of pleasurable and profitable work in | 
growing plants is possible in the home grounds. Even in 
the small city lot, with only its back yard available, a great 
deal can be done; while, as the size of the yard increases, the 
possibilities increase accordingly. 
Zisthetic value. One of the chief values of gardening is 
the esthetic value. One derives a great deal of pleasure in 
raising plants and watching them grow. It is a source of 
never-ending pleasure to start each spring with the seeds 
and watch the wonderful changes that occur till the mature 
plant is formed. The foliage of some garden plants is attrac- 
tive. In the case of the flower garden there is an added
-P-A-G-E-125
  GARDENING 115 
pleasure on account of the beauty of the flowers that one 
can raise. Garden work leads to the cleaning-up of the back 
yards, thus adding to the beauty of the home grounds. 
Economic value. The home garden has a very important 
place for its value in reducing the cost of living. The un- 
precedented rise in the cost of foodstuffs during the last few 
years presents a serious problem to the great majority of 
people. This financial stress may be greatly relieved by 
raising vegetables in the home garden. Even a small garden 
will furnish enough vegetables for a family during the sum- 
mer, and a medium-sized garden will furnish in addition 
enough to can or store in the cellar for winter use; while as 
the garden becomes larger, some of the produce may be 
sold. This possibility of earning money is a motive that 
appeals strongly to children. 
A child with a garden including twenty-five hundred 
square feet should be able to raise at least ten dollars’ worth 
of produce. In larger gardens some city children have made 
from one hundred to three hundred dollars. With proper 
direction a large number of children should be able to earn 
one hundred dollars. When we think of the army of over 
twenty million school children in this country, most of 
whom are free from school duties during the summer, we see 
the tremendous possibilities. If one half of these should 
have a garden, and each raise only ten dollars’ worth of 
produce, that would mean a total of one hundred million 
dollars, or an average of one dollar to every man, woman, 
and child in the United States. Surely this would be worth 
while from the economic standpoint alone, without refer- 
ence to the many other values of gardening. 
Hygienic value. Another value of gardening is found in 
its effect on health. This is produced in two ways. First, 
there is the value of exercise in the open air. Exercise is one 
of the essentials in maintaining health, and gardening fur-
-P-A-G-E-126
  
116 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
nishes a valuable kind. A second effect on health is pro- 
duced because the garden furnishes a healthful kind of food 
and it may be obtained fresh, which makes it more health- 
ful than the vegetables that one buys at the store, which 
have been standing some time. Many people eat too much 
meat food and their health is injured thereby. Anything 
which encourages eating less meat and more vegetables and 
fruits, as a home garden does, makes for better health. And 
when one cans his own fruits and vegetables he may be 
sure that they are clean. 
Ethical value. And finally, and perhaps of more impor- 
tance than anything else, are the lessons that the child learns 
which affect his character. The care of the garden develops 
in the child a sense of responsibility and respect for the 
property rights of other people through his feeling of owner- 
ship for his own garden. And through his own labor he 
develops an appreciation of the dignity of labor. 
It is a great misfortune that so many children have 
nothing to occupy their attention during the long summer 
vacation. As a result they acquire habits of idleness; or 
even worse, in their efforts to find something to do, many 
acquire habits which are positively harmful. Gardening fur- 
nishes the children something definite to take their atten- 
tion and to occupy their time in a profitable way, allowing 
them to earn money as a result of their labors. In marketing 
the products they also acquire a desirable business experi- 
ence. Thus the child acquires habits of thrift instead of 
habits of idleness. 
Another advantage of the home garden is that it con- 
nects the school life of the child with his home life, and 
brings the teacher and parents together and produces a 
better understanding between them. 
Motivation in gardening. There are three main motives 
to which appeal may be made to induce the child to start a
-P-A-G-E-127
  
GARDENING i 117 
garden: the desire to earn money, the desire to eat products 
of his own raising, and the pleasure that the child derives 
from the various garden activities. The desire to earn 
money is a strong motive. The produce can be sold, either 
at home or to neighbors who have no garden, or to the stores. 
In some towns prizes are offered for the best gardens, and 
the game element of competition enters to furnish an addi- 
tional stimulus. And even if no produce is sold, there is the 
appeal that comes from having the products of his labor for 
his own use. The children are interested also in the manual 
activity involved and in the fact that it is done out of 
doors. The rapid changes that take place in the plant as 
the seed germinates and the plant grows hold the child’s 
interest. 
The work in gardening as it may be carried on in the 
schoolroom may be divided into four groups, as follows: —

Most of this work can best be carried on during the 
autumn and winter, excepting for a few plants that mature 
during the spring term, such as strawberries. The purpose 
of this study is to arouse more interest in garden pro- 
ducts through a better understanding of their value and of 
how they have been raised, and thus to create an interest 
in the children to have a garden of their own.

  GARDENING 123 
2. Encouraging home gardening 
Much can be done on the part of the teacher to arouse 
the interest of the children and to encourage them to plant 
a garden. One lesson may be given on why the children 
would like to have a garden. During the winter the teacher 
should send to a number of seed firms for catalogues. The 
pictures found here may be used to interest the children 
and to help them decide what to plant. The topics are so 
arranged in the outline in the last chapter that the plants 
specially suggested for planting in spring are the ones that 
have been studied the previous fall. These points may be 
briefly reviewed to lead the children ‘up to the matter of 
planting these seeds. It is not expected that the children 
will plant only the seeds here suggested, but they should be 
encouraged to include these in their list, because the seeds 
have been so apportioned in the various grades as to in- 
clude the most common types of flowers and vegetables, so 
that if the child raises those suggested each year he will 
have a fair idea of a great variety of plants. 
Charts for primary grades. A great variety of charts may 
be made in connection with the subject of gardening. For 
making the charts a large piece of heavy paper will be 
needed. Each chart should represent some specific idea. 
Oftentimes the heading may be printed across the top of the 
chart in large letters, such as the following: “Vegetables 
that grow below the ground”; “Vegetables whose leaves 
we eat”; “Flowers from mother’s garden”; “Fruits that 
are raised in our State.” The purpose of the chart is ex- 
plained to the children and they are asked to bring appro- 
priate pictures. Catalogues of seedsmen and advertisements 
in magazines and papers will furnish abundance of material. 
The children may cut out the pictures and paste them on 
the chart.
-P-A-G-E-134
  124 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Penny packets of seeds. One way to induce the children 
to start a garden is to give them an opportunity to secure 
seeds at a penny a packet. A number of firms are now selling 
seeds to children at this rate. One of the best-known is 
the Children’s Flower Mission, of Cleveland, Ohio. The 
teacher sends to the firm asking for as many order blanks 
as she thinks she can use. Or a better way is for all the 
teachers in a building or in a town to send together. These 
blanks are sent free. They are given out to the children, 
who take them home and, after talking the matter over with 
their parents, fill out the blanks and bring them to school 
with the money. The blanks and money are sent to Cleve- 
land, and after a short time the seeds are sent back to cor- 
respond with the orders. The express is paid by the firm, 
so that the teacher has no expenses involved. After the 
children have bought their seeds, they will usually plant 
them and care for the plants. At the proper time lessons 
should be given on the various steps in gardening. 
Plans of gardens. In the late winter or early spring the 
teacher may help the children make plans of their gardens. 
Each child should draw on a paper lines to represent the 
boundaries of his garden. On this may be drawn lines to 
represent rows, and on these may be written the names of 
the seeds to be planted and the distances between the rows. 
In this way the child can plan just what he is to plant, and 
how many rows of each vegetable, so that his plans may be 
made to agree with the size of his garden. 
A second lesson may be given on the preparation of the 
soil. The two chief things to consider here are the enrich- 
ment of the soil by fertilizer or manure and the spading of 
the soil and getting it ready for the seeds. 
A third lesson may be given on how to plant seeds. This 
may be worked out as follows: —

Transplanting and thinning. When the time comes for 
transplanting and thinning, lessons should be given on the 
proper way to do them, using seedlings raised in the school- 
room as a result of the previous lesson. These lessons should 
be given at the proper time to do the work outdoors, so 
that the children may apply the lessons at once. The teacher 
should ask the children about their gardens and remind 
them at the appropriate times of the things to be done. 
Garden calendar. Additional interest may be aroused in 
the garden work by keeping a garden calendar on which 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  126 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
the children may record the happenings in their garden. In 
its simplest form it may consist of the following columns: — 
  
Garden activity observed Date Name of child first reporting 
  
  
3. House plants in the schoolroom 
Flowers from bulbs. One of the most satisfactory means 
of securing flowers in the winter is through the use of bulbs. 
All the work can be done by the children and the whole 
cycle may be carried on during the school year. These 
bulbs may be started at any time in the autumn or early 
winter. For this purpose secure some flower pots, — six 
inches or larger, — ordinary garden soil, and bulbs. The 
drainage holes in the flower pots should be covered with 
something which will allow the water to drain out, but keep 
the soil in. Fill with dirt to within a half-inch of the top 
and plant the bulb so that the tip is barely covered. Water 
it thoroughly. The pot must be put in a location that meets 
two requirements; it must be dark and cold. The Chinese 
lily, paper-white narcissus, and Roman hyacinth cannot 
stand freezing, but the daffodil and Dutch hyacinth ‘can. 
Usually some place can be found in the basement, but it 
must not be where the furnace keeps it warm. Bulbs that 
can stand freezing may be placed outdoors on a board and 
covered with leaves or straw with some weight to keep them 
on. During this period the soil must be kept moist. Usually 
if they are well watered when put away and then kept 
covered, this watering will be sufficient. 
During this period a root system is forming, so that when 
the plant is brought into a light, warm room, the stem grows
-P-A-G-E-137
    GARDENING 127 
quickly. The length of time required for these roots to form 
varies according to the bulb. The time to keep out the vari- 
ous bulbs before they may be brought in is given below in 
a table. This is the least time. They may be kept as much 
longer as desired. When brought in, they should be cared 
for like any ordinary house plant. 
_ Aconvenient way for school use is to put the bulbs away 
in October or November, and bring them in just after the 
Christmas vacation. The bulbs which the author has found 
most satisfactory for school use are given below. In order 
to secure a continuous succession of bloom, either different 
kinds of bulbs may be chosen, or the same kind may be 
brought in at different times.

Chinese lily in pebbles. The Chinese lily may be very 
successfully grown in a dish containing some pebbles and 
water. A shallow dish is half filled with pebbles and the 
bulbs are placed among them so as to be supported by them. 
Water is added till it touches the bottom of the bulb. The 
dish is placed in a dark closet for about two weeks, during 
which time the roots grow, and then the dish is brought to 
the light. Water should be added occasionally so as to keep 
the base of the bulb wet.
-P-A-G-E-138
128 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Window boxes. To grow house plants in the schoolroom 
large flower pots or window boxes may be used. These 
window boxes can be made by the boys in the manual- 
training department. Among the best plants to grow in 
the schoolroom are ferns, asparagus sprengeri, and gerani- 
ums. For shady situations, aspidistra, begonia, English ivy, 
oxalis, and primroses also do well. Heliotrope, wandering 
Jew, and fuchsia are well adapted for sunny locations. The 
chief things to consider in the care of house plants are to keep 
them watered and to protect them on cold winter nights. 
Propagation of house plants. Geraniums may be easily 
raised by means of soft-wood cuttings taken from the 
growing part of the stem. If only a few cuttings are to be 
raised, an ordinary flower pot may be used. This should be 
partly filled with clean moist sand well pressed down. To 
make the cutting, a growing tip two to four inches long is 
cut just below a node. The lower leaves are removed so as 
to leave at least an inch of free stem. To reduce the evapo- 
rating surface still more, it is well to cut off about half of 
each of the remaining leaves. By means of a knife an inci- 
sion is made in the sand, and into this the cutting is inserted 
for about an inch and the sand pressed firmly about it. 
To prevent too much evaporation a glass jar or tumbler is 
inverted over the cutting, leaving it raised a trifle on one 
side to admit air. The sand should be kept moist. The 
cutting should be left till new leaves begin to form. This is 
evidence that new roots have formed and the plant may be 
then transplanted. 
If it is desired to raise a large number of cuttings, a win- 
dow box may be used in place of the flower pot. This may 
be covered with a pane of glass. 
Other plants that may be raised in this way are wander- 
ing Jew, begonia, carnation, chrysanthemum, coleus, rose, 
and fuchsia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
GARDENING 129 
Cuttings of the wandering Jew and of some geraniums 
may be successfully started in a tumbler filled with water, 
and then transplanted after the roots have formed. 
This work can all be done by the children, and after the 
cuttings have become well started in the schoolroom, they 
may be taken home by the children and cared for. 
4. Experiments with plants 
A. Raising plants. A great amount of interesting and 
instructive work can be done with seeds and seedlings in the 
schoolroom. But this work should all be done with a definite 
purpose. It is not sufficient merely to plant seeds and then 
let the seedlings die from neglect. The work should be clearly 
motivated from the start. The following purposes are sug- 
gested to guide this work: — 
1. To raise mature plants and secure the products in the 
schoolroom. Radishes may be matured here large 
enough to eat, and nasturtium flowers may be secured. 
2. To raise seedlings early in the season so that later they 
may be taken home and transplanted in the children’s 
gardens. Among those that can be raised in this way 
are lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, and a great variety of 
flowers. 
8. To see the changes that take place in the parts of the 
seed and seedlings as the plant grows. Have some 
‘ device by means of which the growth of the root may 
be watched. One very simple way is to take a tumbler 
and roll up a piece of blotting-paper so that it just 
fits the tumbler. Fill the space in the center of the 
blotting-paper with moist sand. Plant some seeds, 
such as peas, corn, or beans, between the blotting- 
paper and the glass. 
Another way is to put a piece of wet blotting-paper in 
-a plate. On this put some seeds, then cover with another 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
130 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
piece of moist blotting-paper and invert another plate over 
this. When it is desired to watch the progress of the seeds, 
the plate and the blotting-paper may be lifted. 
Another interesting device which enables one to watch 
the early stages of growth is a pocket garden which the 
children can make. Secure two pieces of glass the same size 
(old negatives are very satisfactory) and a piece of blot- 
ting-paper the same size as the glass. Moisten the paper 
and lay it on one of the pieces of glass, On this put a few 
small seeds, such as radish or lettuce. Cut some narrow 
strips of blotting-paper and place them around the edge of 
the large piece two deep, so as to form an enclosure. Put 
the other piece of glass over this and slip on a couple of 
rubber bands to hold all together. When the paper be- 
comes dry, stand the glass on edge in some water for a 
few minutes. Plants may be grown for two weeks in this 
little pocket garden. 
Have the children make a series of drawings, showing the 
changes in the seeds and seedlings. First soak some beans 
overnight. Let the children open them and draw the parts 
of the seed. Have another drawing made when the root 
first comes out of the seed. One drawing should show the 
seedling just as it first comes through the soil. Other 
drawings should be made whenever any noticeable change 
occurs in the seedling. These drawings should be placed 
side by side on a large sheet of paper or else arranged in 
a little booklet. The date should be placed under each 
drawing. These drawings may be made either with or- 
dinary pencil, colored crayons, or water-colors. Children 
are more interested to work with colors. 
4. Eggshell garden. The young children will be much 
interested in an eggshell garden. Each child is asked to 
bring an eggshell to school. On the outside of each shell is 
written the name of the child. A hole is punched in the  
-P-A-G-E-141
GARDENING 131 
bottom of the shell for drainage and the shell filled with 
soil. Each child plants some small seeds in his shell. Differ- 
ent children may plant different seeds. Among the best to 
plant are pepper-grass, lettuce, radish, cabbage, wheat, and 
buckwheat. The eggshells may be kept in a pan filled with 
soil or sawdust. : 
B. Germination experiments. Another set of studies may 
be carried on to learn some facts regarding germination. 
1. To show the conditions needed for germination. 
a. To show the conditions of moisture, put some 
blotting-paper in the bottom of three tumblers. 
Moisten one slightly, a second moderately, and the 
third so that a little water stands on the paper. 
Put seeds in each tumbler and cover by putting 
another tumbler over each. Allow to stand for a 
week or longer and note the differences in the three 
tumblers. 
b. To show that air is necessary, fill one tumbler half 
full of water and in another put a moist piece of 
blotting-paper. Put seeds in both tumblers. Keep 
the paper in the second tumbler moist and allow to 
stand. 
2. To learn the best depth at which to plant seeds. 
Fill a shallow box about seven or eight inches deep 
with soil. In one corner plant three seeds of lettuce, 
three of radish, and three of peas one inch deep. Ina 
second corner, plant three of each, two inches deep; 
in a third corner plant three of each, four inches deep; 
in the fourth corner plant three of each six inches deep. 
Mark on each corner the depth planted. Keep the 
soil moist. Record the time when the first plants of 
each kind appear in each corner. Record in the form 
of a table on the board. At which depth do the plants 
first come up? At which depth do most come up? Is 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
  132   
THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
there any depth at which none come up? The experi- 
ment may also be performed in a quart canning-jar. 
The jar is filled with sand and the seeds planted at 
varying depths next to the glass. This allows their 
growth to be watched. 
3. To test the vitality of seeds to see what per cent will 
4. germinate. 
Lay a piece of moist blotting-paper or cloth on a 
plate. Mark it off into squares. In each square put 
the various seeds to be tested, taking a larger number 
for the smaller seeds. Count them. Cover with another 
piece of moist blotting-paper or cloth. Invert another 
plate over this. Allow to stand for a couple of weeks, 
keeping the paper moist. Figure out the percentage 
of each kind of seed that germinates. 
To learn how the squash seedlings get out of the seed coat. 
Take the same kind of apparatus as that described 
in the last experiment. Plant some squash seeds in it. 
Examine every day. Have the children make drawings 
of the different stages till the seedling is free from the 
seed coat. 
§. To learn what becomes of the cotyledons when the seed 
germinates. 
Plant some seeds of peas and beans in a box or 
tumbler filled with soil or saw dust. When the plants 
are an inch or two high, carefully pull up the whole 
plant and find the cotyledons. The children may 
make a drawing showing the difference. 
C. Work of roots. 
i Root hairs. The work of absorbing moisture is done 
by the root hairs. To show these, put two thicknesses 
of moist blotting-paper in the bottom of a tumbler. 
On this place a few radish seeds. Cover with another 
tumbler. Keep the paper moist. Notice the location
-P-A-G-E-143
  
~ GARDENING 133 
and variation in the length of the root hairs. Have the 
children draw the root hairs. 
. Direction of growth. In order to show the direction in 
which the root of a seedling grows, plant some radish 
seeds in the pocket garden described on page 130. 
Stand the garden on edge. When the roots are about a 
half-inch long, turn the garden one fourth way round. 
Notice the effect on the tip of the root and how long 
it takes before the effect is shown. Turn through 
another ninety degrees and allow to stand for a day. 
Turn several times more. Have the children make 
drawings showing the various positions of the root. 
. Food storage in roots — carrot basket. Some roots serve 
the purpose of storing food. This may be nicely illus- 
trated by making a carrot basket. Cut a carrot in 
two crosswise about in the middle. Take the top half 
and hollow out the center from the cut end, leaving a 
shell of the root around the outside. Fill this with 
water. Suspend this by means of strings or wires in 
the window. Keep the carrot filled with water and 
in a short time the leaves will begin to grow out and 
will curve up around the carrot making a very attrac- 
tive object. 
. Work of the stem. 
. Passage of sap up the stem. The two chief duties of the 
stem are to conduct liquids and to hold up the leaves 
to the sunlight. To show the work in conducting 
liquids, take a piece of a twig of a tree about the size 
of a lead pencil and put one end in red ink. Allow to 
stand for a few hours. Then with a jack-knife make 
sections across the part of the stem that was above the 
ink. The red ring shows where the sap goes up the stem. 
. Direction of growth. Plant some sunflower seed in a 
flower pot filled with soil. When the young plants are
-P-A-G-E-144
134 
  \ 
THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
about three inches high, place the flower pot on its 
side and allow to remain a few days. Notice the direc- 
tion of growth of the stem. 
E. Work of the leaf. The two chief duties of the leaf are 
transpiration and starch-making. To show the passage of — 
water through the leaf, put the end of a spray of leaves 
into some red ink. Notice through what parts of the leaf 
the red ink passes. 
iD. Transpiration. To show transpiration, fill a tumbler 
with water; over it put a piece of paper. Make a hole 
in the center of the paper and put the stem of a large 
leaf through it. Invert a clean tumbler over the leaf 
and put in a sunny position. Notice what forms on 
the sides of the tumbler. How long does it take before 
it begins to form? Put in a shady place and see how 
long it takes. 
. Light and starch-making. Experiments to illustrate the 
process of starch-making are too difficult to perform 
in the ordinary schoolroom, but one simple experiment 
may be performed out of doors to show the need of 
sunlight in the process of starch-making. Put a piece 
of board on the grass. At the end of a week lift the 
board and look at the grass. What change has taken 
place? Remove the board and notice the grass at the 
end of another week. What does this experiment 
show? 
. Leaf exposure to sunlight. Notice the tips of both 
horizontal and vertical branches on the elm and 
maple. Note the position of the leaf surface with 
reference to the light, and note how the petioles help 
the surfaces to attain this position. Some of these 
branches may be cut off and brought into the school- 
room to study. Notice also the position of leaves of a 
vine growing on a building.

CHAPTER XIII 
LESSONS WITH WEEDS 
Motivation. Weeds touch the child’s life in three ways: 
they are one of the most common forms of plant life that 
he sees on every hand; they are an enemy of his garden; 
and some weeds are poisonous either to touch or to taste. 
These three points of contact suggest the lines along which 
the work with weeds may proceed: the identification and 
control of common weeds. The application is found in the 
ability of the child to go out and name the common weeds, 
and in his applying proper methods to control the weeds 
in his garden. 
Collections. Weeds are so common that there is no 
trouble in securing an abundance of materials. An interest- 
ing line of work is to have two types of collections made, 
one of the plants and one of the seeds. In starting a collec- 
tion some definite problem should be suggested, such as to 
make a collection of the weeds found in the garden, or those 
found by the roadside, or in vacant lots, or in the cornfield. 
The plants may be pressed the same as leaves, as explained 
on page 90. 
To mount the weeds secure pieces of heavy paper or light 
cardboard of some uniform size. Place the weed on this and 
fasten it by means of narrow strips of gummed paper, 
which should be put over the parts of the plants in several 
places and stuck to the cardboard. Beneath each specimen 
write the name of the plant, the place where collected, and 
other points of interest. 
If one wishes a more permanent mount, a piece of glass 
may be placed over the specimen and the glass and card- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
board fastened together around the edge with passe- 
partout binding paper. 
In a few years a collection of most of the common weeds 
may be obtained. In case any specimens of either plants or 
seeds cannot be identified by means of the books at hand, 
they may be sent to the State Agricultural College. 
Seed collections. Collections may also be made of weed 
seeds. These may be placed in small vials, which can be 
mounted on cardboard. Another very satisfactory method 
of keeping the seeds is to mount them between two pieces 
of glass. For this purpose secure two pieces of glass of the 
same size (old negatives serve the purpose nicely), and a 
piece of cardboard of the same size, but of extra thickness. 
Plaster-board sold at the lumber dealers, or tarboard obtain- 
able at the printing offices, may be used. In this bore a 
series of holes in regular order about one-half inch in diam- 
eter. In order to get the holes clean-cut, after boring part- 
way through on one side of the cardboard, remove the 
bit and finish the hole by boring from the other side. The 
holes may also be made by a gun punch used in cutting 
wads for shells. Glue a piece of white paper to one side of 
the cardboard. 
When as many kinds of seeds have been collected as 
there are holes in the cardboard, place a piece of glass on 
the table, and on the glass put the cardboard. Place the 
weed seeds in the holes and write the name below each 
hole. Then put the other piece of glass on top and bind 
the two pieces together at the edges with passe-partout 
binding paper or adhesive tape. This gives a very conven- 
ient mount. It is compact and the seeds can easily be seen 
and examined with a magnifying glass. The Specialty 
Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, sells for 
fifteen cents a complete outfit of this kind for mounting 
twenty-four kinds of seeds.
-P-A-G-E-147
  LESSONS WITH WEEDS 187 
Cases of weed seeds mounted in this way have been put 
up for sale by the Weed Seed Laboratory, State Agricul- 
tural College, St. Paul, Minnesota. Each case contains 
twenty-four kinds of seeds. So far four cases have been 
mounted. The price is fifty cents per case. These are very 
helpful in identifying the seeds that the children bring. 
Perhaps the children might be interested to raise the 
money in some way to buy the cases, or they might be 
bought by the school board. ‘ 
Correlation. There are many opportunities for correla- 
tion in connection with art in having the children make 
drawings of the various parts of the plant. It adds interest 
to have the children make booklets, in which may be kept 
a series of drawings of different weeds. Small pieces of the 
weed plant may be pressed and mounted in these booklets 
together with the drawings. If desired, the language work 
may be correlated here and brief compositions on weeds 
may be kept in the same booklet. 
Arithmetic. A number of problems relative to the repro- 
ductive power of weeds may be given. 
1. It has been estimated that a single plant of pigweed may pro- 
duce 300,000 seeds. If each seed grows to form a plant bearing 
the same number of seeds and this continued year after year, 
how many seeds would there be at the end of the fifth season? 
2. A single plant of Indian mallow was found to produce 2480 
seeds, and to cover 315 square inches of space. If each seed 
should form a plant of the average size bearing the above 
number of seeds, how much space would these plants cover 
the next season? How much space the season following this? 
8. Take some common weed and estimate the number of seeds 
it produces and the area covered by one plant, and then com- 
pute the area covered by its descendants at the end of the 
third season. 
Most of the work with weeds is best carried on in the 
grammar grades, although a little might be done in the
-P-A-G-E-148
138 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
upper intermediate grades. The autumn is the best time on 
account of the great abundance of material at that time. 
In the spring, when the gardens are started, attention may 
be called to the best methods of keeping weeds out of the 
| garden. 
; Following is a brief outline of the main points to be 
| brought out in the study of a particular weed: — 
1. Identification. 
A. By size and general form. 
B. By leaves. 
C. By flowers. 
D. By fruit. 
E. By habits of growth. 
2. Harm done. 
8. Kind (annual, biennial, or perennial). 
4. Troublesome characters of seeds. 
A. Number on a plant. 
B. Adaptation for dispersal. 
C. Number of years retain vitality. 
5. Means of control. 
Lessons on weeds

LESSONS WITH WEEDS 139 
8. Color of fruit. 
4. Height to which plant grows. 
Application. 
Ask the children to be on the watch for ivy, and if they see any 
to report to the class where. Have a map made of the vicinity 
of the school and on this mark the places where the ivy grows. 
Have a collection of poisonous plants made. 
Correlated work. 
Art. 
Have the children make drawing of the two leaves side by side. 
This should be followed by another lesson on what to do in case 
of poisoning by ivy. 
Topics: PiawEep AND Lamp’s Quarters (AUTUMN) 
Materials: Specimen of a whole plant of each; several specimens 
of leaves and fruit. 
Child’s problem. 
How may the rough pigweed and lamb’s quarters be told apart? 
Outline of development. 
1. Differences in leaves. 
2. In fruit. 
38. In seeds. 
4. In form of plant. 
Application. 
Ask the children to bring a leaf of each kind of plant. Have a 
collection made of weeds of the garden (both plants and 
seeds). 
Correlated work. 
Art. 
Have drawings made of leaves of both plants; also of seeds 
enlarged as seen under a magnifying glass. 
Toric: NumpBEr or SEEps on A Puant (AuTUMN) 
Child’s problem. 
How many seeds does a single plant of burdock (or other plant) 
produce?  
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Materials and method: Have an entire plant of several kinds of 
weeds brought into the schoolroom. Divide the children into as 
many groups as there are kinds of weeds to be studied, and dis- 
tribute among them portions of the plant. Or if the plant is a 
large one, the whole school may work on the same plant. Show 
them how to count a small portion carefully, and then estimate 
the proportions of the whole that this part is. Put the results 
on the board and add all together, so as to get the total number 
of seeds on the plant. 
Correlated work. 
Arithmetic. 
Ask them to determine for each plant the number of seeds 
that might be produced in three years if all the seeds grew 
and bore the same number of plants as this one. 
Application. 
Ask each child to find a plant outdoors like the one he has been 
studying and estimate the area of ground it covers. Take the 
average of the reports given by the children. Then ask them 
to figure out what area would be occupied by the plants grow- 
ing from the seeds on a single plant? What area the next sea- 
son following? 
To show the part that birds play in eating weed seeds, have the 
children gather the same kind of weeds in the spring and estimate 
the number of seeds found then. When the weeds are gathered, 
look closely on the ground beneath to see if many seeds are found. 
Seeds in soil. To show the abundance of weed seeds in 
almost all kinds of soils, have small quantities of soils 
brought in from a variety of situations: from the garden; 
from the edge of a pond; from different levels in a cellar 
that is being dug; from the roadside; from a vacant lot, ete. 
Place in separate flower pots. Keep in a warm place, water 
the soil, and notice how many plants come up.

PART IV 
HYGIENE 
 
-P-A-G-E-152

-P-A-G-E-153
CHAPTER XIV 
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 
Importance. The importance of health in everything that 
one undertakes in life, and hence the supreme importance 
of teaching boys and girls how to care for their health, is 
self-evident. Hygiene is the most important subject in the 
school curriculum. All that the child may learn about 
history and geography fades into insignificance compared 
with the tremendous value of health. And yet, in spite of 
its overshadowing importance, it is one of the most neglected 
subjects in the curriculum. It is a sad reflection upon the 
efficiency of our school system that the most vital subject 
should receive so little attention. 
Results in the past. It seems to be the general consensus 
of opinion of careful observers that the teaching of physi- 
ology and hygiene in the schools has largely been a failure, 
when judged by the results obtained in the lives of the 
children. If the teaching of hygiene is to be effective, it 
must show its effect upon the habits of living practiced by 
boys and girls. Judged on this basis, physiology teaching 
has not proved successful. 
As a definite illustration of this fact the following figures 
will be of interest. Dr. Hoag was employed by the Minne- 
sota State Board of Health to travel through the State and 
visit the schools to ascertain the general health conditions 
and to recommend remedies. In the towns that he visited, 
he secured information regarding the health habits of the 
children. When the results obtained from several thousand 
children in a number of cities and towns were tabulated, 
the following figures were found: —  
-P-A-G-E-154
     Hy 
144 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Thirty-seven per cent had no ventilation of bedroom. 
Only nineteen per cent used a toothbrush daily. 
Nine per cent used a common toothbrush. 
Fifty per cent had never been to a dentist. 
Seventy-one per cent used coffee daily. 
Eighty-two had no fruit for breakfast. 
The conditions found in each of the towns were approxi- 
mately the same. When one considers the appalling lack of 
proper habits regarding the great essentials of air, food, and 
cleanliness displayed by these results, the crying need of 
teaching children the proper habits of living is very evident. 
Another indication that the American people are not fol- 
lowing hygienic habits of living is found in the fact that the 
death-rate for people over forty years of age is increasing 
in the United States, although it is decreasing in Europe. 
Causes for failure. It is not difficult to find some of the 
reasons for the failure of physiology teaching. In the first 
place, it has been anatomy and physiology that have been 
taught, and not hygiene, and so the whole point has been 
missed. Teachers are frequently not prepared to teach the 
subject and dislike it, and this feeling is caught by the 
children. The excuse has sometimes been given that time 
enough could not be found to teach it. This, of course, 
simply shows lack of understanding of the importance of 
the subject. The most important things must be taught, 
and minor things must give way. 
Many of the textbooks used have been poorly adapted 
to the child in every way, in the topics treated and in the 
method of treatment. In some cases an excessive amount 
of time devoted to temperance physiology has given the 
children a dislike for the subject, and has given a wrong 
perspective of the whole subject of hygiene. 
Essentials for good teaching: (1) Formation of proper 
habits. We will now pass from negative to positive considera-
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 145 
tions, and discuss some of the things essential for the success- 
ful teaching of hygiene. First and foremost, and always to be 
kept in mind by the teacher, is the fact that the purpose of 
teaching hygiene is to help the child to form proper habits 
of living. The only and sole purpose of the subject is to 
teach the child how to look after his health and that of the 
community. Any teaching of hygiene that does not have 
this purpose must necessarily be a failure; and any teaching 
that does not procure this result is a failure. Habit forma- 
tion, then, is the keynote. The mere giving of information 
is valuable only so far as it helps in the forming of habits; 
but simply to give the child information about hygiene 
which he does not apply falls wide of the mark. The child 
should be taught how to do, rather than why. 
This is especially true of the lower grades, as very little 
work in the formal teaching of hygiene by set lessons can 
be done. But much can be done to help the children to 
form correct habits. The actual results obtained depend 
partly upon the home influences. If the parents codperate 
with the teacher, much good can be done; if the parents are 
indifferent, less can be accomplished, but still something 
can be done. 
Home habits. The following are the more essential habits 
of hygiene that the teacher should try to have the children 
acquire: (1) washing hands before eating; (2) thorough 
mastication of food; (8) abstaining from tea and coffee; 
(4) cleaning teeth daily; (5) retiring early; (6) ventilation 
of sleeping-room; (7) playing out of doors regularly; (8) care 
of the eyes in reading. 
Simply to give a lesson on each of these habits is not 
enough; it is but the initial step. The child’s habits must 
be followed from week to week. Frequently the teacher 
should have the children report on the extent to which 
they are doing the things suggested, and in many ways the 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  
{ 
146 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
teacher should seek to call the matter to their attention. 
The secret of success in forming habits is constant repeti- 
tion. 
School habits. There are some habits which the teacher 
can directly supervise in the schoolroom, such as the fol- 
lowing: (1) correct posture; (2) use of eyes; (3) cleanliness 
of hands, face, and clothing; (4) use of individual towels. 
These come under the constant supervision of the teacher, 
and these matters should often be brought to the attention 
of the children till the correct habits are formed. 
Habits to discourage. There are often some bad habits 
which children acquire that the teacher should discourage 
and try to break up; such as: (1) putting things in the ear, 
and using objects like hairpins to clean the ear; (2) expecto- 
rating on the floor; (3) coughing in other people’s faces; 
(4) reading in dim light; (5) putting objects in the mouth. 
In order to break up a habit, the teacher must frequently 
call the attention of the children to it and get them to 
thinking about it, instead of doing it automatically. 
The teacher must realize at the start the fundamental 
importance of the subject, and must let nothing swerve her 
from the main purpose. It is a difficult matter to form health 
habits and requires constant and continued effort on the 
part of both the teacher and child till the habit is formed. 
Mere knowledge of a fact does not mean that the child will 
apply it. Further suggestions by the teacher are needed te 
help the child act. 
(2) Teacher’s habits. The teacher herself must have the 
proper habits of living, both for her own sake that she may 
make the most of life, and for the sake of the children that 
her example may be a model for the children to follow. 
(3) Hygiene, not anatomy and physiology. The thing to 
emphasize is hygiene, and not anatomy and physiology. 
The human body is too complicated 2 mechanism for the
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 147 
pupil to understand, in the first place; and furthermore, 
knowledge of anatomy and physiology has practically no 
influence on the formation of health habits. The time to 
form these habits is when the child is very young, in the 
primary grade, and when he cannot understand even the 
reasons for them; but the thing to do is to get the habit 
formed. In carrying on actions by habits the child does not 
have time to think; if he did, the action would cease to be a 
habit. Anatomy has no place whatever in the elementary 
schools, and physiology only a very minor place, such that 
the child may understand in a very general way the purpose 
of the heart, stomach, and other organs of the body. How 
absurd to-day seem the old methods of attempting to teach 
the care of the body by having the children learn the names 
of the bones, and having them trace on a chart the circu- 
lation of the blood. 
(4) Emphasis on positive side. The positive side of good 
health should be emphasized, rather than the negative side 
of disease. The child should have held up before him the 
ideals of good health and the value of health in everything 
that he wishes to do. He should be led into good habits by 
the desire to attain good results, not by the fear of ill results. 
This statement is based on a well-known truth in psychol- 
ogy, that a stronger appeal can be made to a child through 
desire than through fear. Too much emphasis on the dis- 
ease side and the ill effects of improper habits of living may 
produce a morbid feeling that is distinctly injurious. 
(6) Both personal and public hygiene to be taught. But the 
entire emphasis should not be laid on personal hygiene. In 
the earlier years special attention may be given to forming 
correct personal habits. In the later years special consider- 
ation should be given to the health of the community. 
Attention should be called to those matters in which all 
are equally concerned and for which all must codperate,
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
such as the public water supply, the milk supply, the food 
supply, and the control of contagious diseases. The child 
is to work not merely for himself, but for others as well. 
And, of course, this emphasis on public hygiene eventually 
gets back to a renewed emphasis on personal hygiene; but it 
is from a new standpoint, that of the relation of these habits 
to the welfare of other people; so that the child has a double 
incentive for correct living, for himself and for others. 
(6) Constant supervision. Hygiene should be taught, not as 
an isolated subject that comes at a certain period of the day 
and then is forgotten, but as a constant part of all the daily 
school life of the child. At any and every part of the day 
that any point of hygiene is involved, then should the 
teacher see that the proper thing is done. The habits of the 
child should be under constant supervision by the teacher 
at all times. 
Motivation. One of the first essentials in teaching is to 
arouse the children’s interest. How may this be done in 
hygiene? At the outset we meet a discouraging fact, but 
one which we must face, namely, that children have little 
or no interest in health as an aim in itself. This being the 
case, we must find some interests which can be used indi- 
rectly to promote health habits. All possible interests, both 
direct and indirect, must be found in the present activities 
of the child. The child is not interested in the dim and dis- 
tant future. To seek to interest a child in what may happen 
in his life ten or even five years ahead means nothing to him. 
It makes no appeal to him. Our appeal must be made to 
the present. 
There are a number of ways in which the interests of the 
child may be appealed to and used indirectly in teaching 
hygiene. Among these are the following: play instincts, 
desire for teacher’s approval, competition, imitation, drama- 
tization, and grading pupils on habits rather than knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-159
THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 149 
(1) Play and exercise. It is a very easy matter to get the 
child to acquire habits of exercise through play. This in- 
stinct is very strong and forms a large part of the child’s 
life. It simply needs to be encouraged and guided into those 
kinds of plays that require exercise and take the child out 
of doors. No attempt will be made here to suggest any 
specific games, as there are a number of books that go into 
this matter quite fully. 
(2) Teacher’s approval. If there exists the right feeling of 
friendliness and codperation between the teacher and child, 
he will be glad to do things to please the teacher. And if he 
has confidence in her, he may be led to do certain things 
which the teacher tells him are best for him to do, even if he 
does not understand the reasons for doing them. The teacher 
may use this spirit to help the child in forming desirable 
habits. 
(3) Competition. Competition is always more or less of 
an element all through the child’s life. While this may be 
carried to an extreme, it has its place and may be used by 
the teacher in teaching hygiene. After the teacher has made 
clear to the children what the desirable habits of hygiene 
are, she may stimulate a little emulation in the children, as 
is often profitably done in other subjects. She might have 
a roll of honor list on the board, and those who have done 
certain things for a week would have their names placed 
there. Or all the names might be placed on the board and 
stars put after each name, whenever certain things at home 
or school had been done, such as cleaning the teeth or going 
without coffee. The children’s hands may be examined each 
morning to see which have the cleanest hands. Competition 
may be started between the different rows to see which row 
can keep their teeth the cleanest. Similarly, other desirable 
habits may be taken, and other similar devices will suggest 
themselves. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
150 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
(4) Imitation. Imitation is one of the commonest methods 
by which the child acquires habits. This is usually uncon- 
scious on the part of both the child and the one who is being 
imitated. Here is one of the strongest reasons, from the 
school standpoint, why the teacher herself should have 
correct habits of living. The children will unconsciously 
imitate her, and, if her habits do not correspond with the 
teaching, little good can be done. But if they do harmonize,   
this will make another link in the chain which is helping — 
the children form correct habits. The teacher may find some 
person whom the child particularly admires, and he may 
thus be stimulated to imitate desirable habits that this per- 
son may possess. 
(5) Dramatization. Dramatization is a very powerful 
means of interesting children and teaching various lessons, 
as this involves the play instinct. In case of those activities 
which occur at home, the children may play the various parts 
as they should be done. To show how to use the eyes in read- 
ing, a table may be arranged to represent a home circle and 
various children may take the part of father, mother, and 
children. The parents may then show the children how they 
should sit with reference to the light. The part may be 
played again by other children. 
To teach some of the rules of eating, a table may be sup- 
posed to be set with various foods, which may be indicated 
by pieces of paper with names of food written on them. 
Two children may represent the parents and may take the 
responsibility to see that others who act as their children 
take the right kinds of food. Mistakes should be corrected. 
In a similar way other habits may be acted out, such 
as opening a window before going to bed. The child may 
take a toothbrush and tumbler and go through the motions 
of cleaning his teeth. The girls may show how to care for 
food, and how to keep the house clean. Certain children 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 151 
who take the part of parents may give lessons in their own 
language to other pupils playing the part of their children. 
They may be allowed to write a drama of their own and 
present it. 
Treatment for emergencies may be acted out by suppos- 
ing that some child in the room has met with an accident, 
and having the other children treat him. 
Fifteen playlets for children on health subjects have 
been prepared by the National Association for the Study 
of Tuberculosis, whose address is given on page 152. 
(6) Credit for habits. The child should be judged and 
graded, if grading must be done, not by what he knows about 
the subject, but by what he does. The child’s habits at school 
should be watched, and the extent to which he is carrying 
out proper habits at home should be learned by observation 
and by questioning, and the child graded accordingly. This 
will be one stimulus to help him acquire proper habits. This 
is an extension in one particular field of a principle which is 
receiving recognition in many schools, namely, giving school 
credit for home work. And so here we may give credit for 
home habits. Perhaps, to begin with, the grades might be 
based half on the child’s knowledge, in case a textbook is 
used, and half on his application of this knowledge. 
On page 152 is given a health record that the author has 
used successfully in the intermediate grades. The time for 
retiring will vary according to the grade. 
Each child fills out his blank with the assistance of the 
parents, who sign the record at the end of each week. 
These blanks are then brought to school. 
In order to arouse interest and stimulate competition a 
Health League was formed by the different rooms using 
this record. The average grade of all the children in each 
room was taken weekly. An appropriate chart was posted 
in a conspicuous place and on this were written the names

of the rooms and their averages, the highest first. A hygiene 
banner was provided and the class having the highest aver- 
age kept the banner in its room for a week. New averages 
were made up at the beginning of each week and the banner 
awarded accordingly. 
The reports of the parents and teachers indicated that 
the plan was eminently successful. 
An organization known as the “Modern Health Cru- 
saders ” has recently been formed, as a means of inducing 
children to form hygienic habits of living. There has been 
published a list of health chores, somewhat similar to those 
given in the above health record. Children who perform 
eighty per cent of these chores for certain periods of time 
receive various titles according to the length of the period 
that the chores are done. At the beginning of 1918 this or- 
ganization had a membership of several hundred thousand. 
Full particulars may be obtained by writing “The Na- 
tional Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuber- 
culosis,” 105 East 22d Street, New York City. 
Science method. Another way to arouse interest is to use 
the science approach and method in teaching the lessons on 
hygiene. As far as possible provide concrete material which 
the child: can study, and with which experiments may be
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 158 
performed. In studying the hygiene of breathing and ven- 
tilation, perform some simple experiments showing the com- 
position and pressure of air, and then pass to the hygiene 
of air. The study of water may be introduced by experi- 
ments showing some properties of water, and the changes 
in state through which water passes. Foods may be brought 
into the schoolroom and tested for their constituents, fats, 
proteins, and carbo-hydrates. In each of these cases, having 
aroused the interest of the children in the general topic by 
means of concrete experiments, the hygienic applications 
of the topic may then be presented to the children. In 
chapter XV more definite suggestions are given along this 
line. 
Work in primary grades. As we have already seen, the 
chief thing in the primary grades is to encourage the forma- 
tion of health habits. One of the best ways to encourage 
these is a frequent inspection of each pupil. This may be 
given several times a week, or perhaps every day. The 
children may be taken in rows and examined a row at a 
time for the following features: (1) cleanliness of hands and 
nails; (2) cleanliness of face and ears; (3) cleanliness of 
teeth; (4) cleanliness of clothing; (5) care of hair. Those 
who are very unclean may be sent to the washroom to get 
cleaned up. As a stimulus for keeping clean, perhaps those 
who are generally unclean may be put in a division by 
themselves and called the “unclean” or “careless” squad, 
till they deserve promotion by being more careful. The 
exact things to be done must depend on the homes from 
which the children come. The teacher must use tact, as the 
condition of the child usually reflects the ideals of the 
home. 
Hygiene charts. One very effective way of arousing the 
child’s interest and leading his attention to certain desirable 
habits is the construction of hygiene charts by the children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Following are suggested some possible topics for each of 
which a chart may be worked out: — 
How to Keep Clean. 
A Good Breakfast, or Dinner, or Supper. 
Good Drinks for Children. 
How to Get Fresh Air. 
How to Get Exercise. 
How to Clean the Teeth. 
Where my Mittens Came From. 
In some schools toothbrush drills are given, in which the 
children are shown how to brush their teeth. 
Work in intermediate grades. In the lower intermediate 
grades the. work may proceed along lines similar to those 
followed in the primary grades, but the work should be 
extended to meet the growing capacity of the child, and 
oral lessons on hygiene given in the fourth and fifth 
grades. Some of the simple experiments given in chapter 
XV may be performed in the intermediate grades. In the 
sixth grade a simple textbook on personal hygiene may be 
used. 
Textbooks. Great care should be used in selecting a text- 
book. Not many years ago there were no satisfactory texts 
really suited to grade use, but in recent years a number of 
really good books have appeared. A satisfactory text for 
the sixth grade should be written almost entirely from the 
standpoint of hygiene. It should contain very little if any 
reference to anatomy or physiology. It should be organized 
from the child’s standpoint, and written in such simple 
language that the child can understand it. It should con- 
tain a large number of appropriate illustrations. 
It seems desirable to use two textbooks throughout the 
grades,— one in the sixth grade emphasizing personal 
hygiene, and another in the seventh or eighth grade empha- 
sizing public hygiene.
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE 157 
if he started to drink alcoholic liquors, makes no appeal to 
him. 
The whole question of the physiological effect of alcohol 
is very complicated, but the child can be taught that even 
in small quantities it is injurious to the growing tissues of 
boys and girls. 
The effect of the use of alcoholic liquors on the child’s 
life may be shown in two ways. One way applies to all chil- 
dren. Alcohol, through causing paupers, criminals, and 
insane people, creates an increase in the taxes that the 
child’s father must pay, and hence that leaves less money 
to be used for the needs of the child. In case a child’s father 
uses alcohol, the effect on the family through the squander- 
ing of money, and perhaps the physical abuse of the chil- 
dren, may be noted as another way in which alcohol may 
affect the child’s life. Of course, this can be discussed only 
in a general way before a schoolroom of children. 
The disagreeable and dangerous acts of men under the 
influence of liquor may be cited as a thing that makes the 
town a less desirable place for the child to live in. 
When the boy becomes of an age when he is looking for a 
position, then it may be pointed out to him that there are 
certain positions where no one will be employed who uses 
alcohol, and that in most other positions a person who does 
not drink stands a better chance than one who does. This 
makes a direct appeal to the boy. 
Teaching hygiene by jingles and stories. Lessons in 
hygiene may be brought home to the child forcibly by means 
of jingles. The following example is taken from Dr. Allen’s 
Alice in Wonderland : — 
“Mary had a little cold, 
It started in her head: 
And everywhere that Mary went 
That cold was sure to spread.
-P-A-G-E-166
  
158 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
“She took it into school one day, — | 
There was n’t any rule:

To have that cold in school. 
“The teacher tried to drive it out, 
She tried hard, but — ker-choo; 
It did n’t do a bit of good, 
Cause teacher caught it too.” 
Health lessons may also be taught by means of stories. 
The following pamphlets relating to the care of the teeth 
are adapted for use with the primary and intermediate 
grades, and may be obtained free from the Colgate Company, 
New York City: The Jungle School; Magic Pearls; Dental 
Lectures; Instructions for the Home Care of the Teeth. A

free from the Webster Chemical Company, St. Paul, Min- 
nesota. :

CHAPTER XV 
TEACHING HYGIENE THROUGH EXPERIMENTS 
Tue science approach will make the subject of hygiene 
more interesting and so lead to more effective results. If 
concrete materials are used in connection with lessons in 
hygiene, these may be employed as an introduction to the 
application of the laws of hygiene that it is desired the child 
shall make. In this chapter are described a number of sim- 
ple experiments that may be taken up in connection with 
hygiene. These are intended to be merely suggestive. Many 
other lessons should be worked out in connection with them, 
and emphasis placed on the appropriate applications. They 
are adapted to the grammar and upper intermediate grades. 
These experiments are arranged under the topics of hygiene 
which they most closely illustrate. 
I. Breataine AnD VENTILATION 
A. Breathing 
1. Composition of the air. 
Apparatus: Candle, cork, plate, tumbler, lime water. 
a. Get.a cork stopper a little larger than the diameter of a candle. 
Cut off a piece about a half-inch thick from the large end. In the 
center cut a hole big enough to receive a short candle about an inch 
long. Float this in a plate filled with water. Light the candle, and 
after it is burning well, invert the glass tumbler over it. Allow to 
stand for a few minutes. Why does the candle go out? What hap- 
pens to the water? The water rises to take the place of the oxygen 
used by the candle. The gas left in the tumbler is nitrogen. 
b. To show the presence of carbon dioxide, pour some lime 
water in a dish and allow to stand for several hours. The white 
coating that forms on the surface shows the presence of carbon 
dioxide.
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
c. To show the presence of water in the air, bring into the school- 
room a metal cup containing ice water. The water that condenses 
on the outside of the cup comes from the air. 
2. Effect on air of breathing. 
How does the air we breathe out differ from the air we breathe 
in? 
a. Breathe on the bulb of a thermometer and compare the tem- 
perature with that of the room. 
b. Pour some lime water into a bottle and blow through it by 
means of a straw or tube. Pour some lime water into another bottle 
and force air through it with a bicycle pump. Which gets the 
milkier? What does this show? 
c. Breathe on a window pane. What do the results show? 
d. What three changes have taken place in the air we breathe 
out? 
3. Rate of breathing. 
While the teacher times them by a watch, have each child count 
the number of times he breathes in a minute. Repeat several 
times to find the average. Find the average for the whole class. 
Try it again after the children have been taking some vigorous 
exercise like running. 
4. Amount of air breathed. 
Apparatus: A two-quart canning-jar, large pan, glass tube bent 
at one end, or a piece of rubber tubing with a bent piece of glass 
tubing inserted at one end. 
a. Fill the jar with water, cover with a piece of cardboard and 
invert it in the pan of water without allowing the water to escape 
from the jar. Insert the bent end of the tube under the mouth of 
the jar. Have some child breathe through the tube till the water 
is all forced out of the jar. See how many breaths are required to 
fill the jar with air. Let several children try it. After each child 
has used the tube, cleanse the end in some disinfectant, such as 
hydrogen peroxide, and wash in water. From this experiment and 
from a previous one showing how many times one breathes in a 
minute, compute the amount of air that all of the children in the 
room breathe in during a minute. 
b. For another experiment the children may test their lung 
capacity. Fill and invert the jar as above. After a child has taken  
-P-A-G-E-169
  EXPERIMENTS IN HYGIENE 161 
a deep breath, let him force out all the water he can in one breath. 
Record the amount on the board. Have a number of children try 
this. 
B. Ventilation 
1. Ventilation of the schoolroom. 
Apparatus: Two thermometers,-a-piece of soft muslin, touch 
paper or joss sticks, tufts of down. 
a. Amount of air entering. Throw a tuft of down in front of the 
air inlet and estimate how far it travels in a second. Do this several 
times and take the average for the velocity with which the air en- 
ters. Measure the length and breadth of the air inlet. Find the 
area and then multiply by the velocity to find the amount of air 
entering in a second. Find how much enters in a minute. Compare 
this with the amount of air that the children breathe each minute 
as found in a previous experiment. 
6. Direction of air currents. Light a joss stick or piece of cloth 
and hold in different parts of the room and thus determine the 
direction of the air currents by means of the smoke. Make a dia- 
gram of the room on the board and indicate the air currents by 
means of arrows. 
c. Temperature. Place a thermometer in different parts of the 
room and find the temperature. 
d. Humidity. Fasten a piece of soft muslin cloth around the 
bulb of one thermometer, and allow the other end of the cloth to 
hang in a bottle filled with water. Hang another thermometer be- 
side this. Fan the bulbs vigorously for a short time, then look at 
the reading of the wet bulb. Continue to fan till the mercury in 
the wet bulb ceases to go any lower. Then take the readings of 
both thermometers. A slight difference means a moist air; a large 
difference means a dry air. The percentage of humidity may be 
found approximately from the following table: — 
Difference in readings * Temperature (dry bulb) 
40 50 60 70 80 
4 68% 4% 8% 81% 88%

  162 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
To show the way of using the table, suppose the difference be- 
tween the two thermometers is 16 and the reading of the dry bulb 
is '70, the figure opposite 16 and under 70, in this case 33, gives the 
per cent of humidity. 
2. Conditions needed for ventilation. 
Apparatus: Candle, lamp, chimney with even top, two matches, 
cardboard. 
Light the candle. Place the chimney over it. Why does the 
candle go out? 
Light the candle again. On each side place a match. On the 
matches place the chimney and cover the top with the cardboard. 
Why does the candle go out? 
Repeat the previous experiment, except that the cardboard is 
not placed over the chimney. Why does the candle continue to 
burn? What do these experiments show? 
Application. As a result of these experiments on breathing and 
ventilation, the children should be led to see the need of ventila- 
tion and the method by which it can be secured under all conditions. 
Special emphasis should be placed on the ventilation of the school- 
room and of the sleeping-room at night by the children.

Apparatus: Stick of wood, board with groove, file, nail, penny, 
hammer, stone, sulphuric acid, unslaked lime, lime water, a burn- 
ing-glass. 
1. Friction. Rub a stick back and forth in a groove of wood; 
feel of the wood. Rub a coin over the table; feel of the coin. File a 
nail vigorously, and then feel of the nail. 
2. Percussion. Place a penny or a piece of metal on a stone and 
strike it several times with a hammer; feel the metal. 
8. Chemical action. Pour a few drops of sulphuric acid into a 
small dish of water; notice the change in temperature by feeling 
of the outside of the dish. Or add some water to unslaked lime 
and note the results. 
4. Electricity. Turn on the electric light and hold the hand over 
the bulb. What do you notice? 
5. Combustion. Light a splint of wood and insert it in a wide- 
mouthed bottle. When it goes out, light it and insert in the

bottle again. Pour some lime water into the bottle, cover with a 
piece of cardboard, and shake. What change takes place in the 
lime water? This white precipitate shows the presence of carbon 
dioxide formed by the burning of wood. 
6. The Sun. Hold a burning-glass at right angles to the sun’s 
rays and focus on a piece of paper. 
B. Method of starting fires 
Notice the parts of an ordinary match. Light it and note the 
order in which the different parts burn. Compare a safety match 
with an ordinary match and note the differences. Try to light each 
one on an ordinary board surface. What difference do you find? 
What advantage has the safety match?

1. On gases. 
Apparatus: Flask, rubber Biante with a single hole, glass tub- 
ing, alcohol lamp, tumbler, chimney, joss stick or cloth, candle. 
Push the tubing through the stopper and insert the stopper in 
the flask. Fill the tumbler with water and place the end of the 
tube in it, and heat the flask gently with the alcohol lamp. Notice 
what happens at the end of the tube. What is the explanation? 
Remove the lamp, but allow the end of the tube to remain in the 
water. What happens? What does this show? 
Light a candle. On each side place a match. On the matches 
place a chimney. Light a joss stick or piece of cloth and hold at 
the lower end of the chimney near the matches. What do you 
notice inside of the chimney? What does this show? 
How are the principles shown in these two experiments applied 
in the hot-air furnace? 
2. On liquids. 
Apparatus: Flask, stopper, and tube as in previous experiment, 
test tube, sawdust. 
Fill the flask with water and insert the stopper so that the water 
stands in the tube about an inch above the stopper. Tie a colored 
string around the tube at the surface of the water. Heat the flask 
with the alcohol lamp and watch the liquid in the tube. Remove the 
lamp and allow the water to cool. What happens to the water in 
the tube in each case? What does this show? Put some sawdust in 
a test tube filled with water, and heat. Note the motion of the saw- 
dust.

How are the principles illustrated by these two experiments ap- 
plied in hot-water heating? 
D. Measuring the temperature 
1. How to use a thermometer. 
Apparatus: Ordinary thermometer, card thermometer, ict, 
warm water. 
The children in the third grade may each make a cardboard 
thermometer. Get a piece of cardboard about an inch and a half 
wide and a little longer than an ordinary thermometer. Draw a 
line through the center of the cardboard and copy on it the readings 
of the thermometer scale, ranging from 20° below zero to 100° above. 
Punch a hole through the cardboard at each of these ends of the 
scale. Pass through one hole a white string and through the other 
hole a red or blue string. Tie them together at the back of the card- 
board. Pull them tight and tie them in front. In place of a string a 
narrow ribbon may be used. 
The colored string represents the liquid in a thermometer, and 
the knot represents the top of the liquid. Set this knot at various 
positions and ask the children to read them. Ask the children to 
set their thermometers at various temperatures. 
After the children can read these, use the ordinary thermometer 
and have them read it at various temperatures. Breathe on the 
bulb, place the bulb in ice water, then add warm water, and have 
a reading made each time. 
Have the children make readings of the thermometer for a week 
both indoors and out of doors at different times of the day, and 
keep records on the board.

Apparatus: Various kinds of food, iodine, nitric acid, ammonia, 
alcohol lamp. 
1. To test for starch. 
Heat a little starch in water, allow it to cool, and then add 
a few drops of a diluted solution of iodine in alcohol. A blue color 
shows the presence of starch. Test in a similar way a number of 
common foods.

2. To test for proteins. 
Heat the white of an egg slowly. This hardening is a test for 
proteins. 
For another test add some nitric acid to a piece of meat, and boil. 
Pour out the acid, rinse the meat in water, and then add am- 
monia. The yellow color is a test for proteins. Test a number of 
foods for protein. 
3. To test for fats. 
Place a piece of butter on a bit of paper and warm gently. 
What change takes place in the paper? This is a test for fat. 
For another test heat the substance gently in a test tube without 
burning the food. Then add warm water and see if any fat collects 
on the surface. 
Test a number of foods for fats. 
Put records in the form of the following tables: — 
  
Kind of food Starch Protein Fat 
  
  
Put the names of the foods in the first column, and put a check 
opposite each food in the proper column to correspond with the 
tests. 
B. To study the action of baking powders 
Put a little baking powder into water and note what happens. 
Put some powder into vinegar and note the results. 
Dissolve soda and cream of tartar separately in cold water. Then 
pour one into the other. Try hot water and note any difference. 
C. To study the action of yeast 
Make a paste of flour and water. Mix with this a small piece of 
yeast cake. Allow to stand a while in a warm place and notice 
what happens. 
Put in each of two test tubes or small bottles a teaspoonful 
of molasses and ten teaspoonfuls of water. Mix a small piece of 
yeast cake with water and add half to each bottle. Allow to stand

warm place. Notice any difference in the two at the end of that 
time. ' 
IV. Tur Eye 
Materials: Snellen’s vision chart, piece of white cardboard 
about six inches square, reading-lens, convex and concave lenses, 
candle. 
1. To test the eye. 
The teacher should secure a Snellen’s vision chart, and follow- 
ing the directions there given should test the eyes of each child. 
Cases of defective vision should be reported to the principal. 
2. To show how the image is formed. 
Hold the reading-glass and the white cardboard in line with the 
window till images appear distinct on the cardboard. How does 
the image differ from the object? How does the distance affect the 
relative size of the image? 
8. To illustrate binocular vision. 
a. Hold two pencils vertically before the eye, one about a foot 
away and the other about two feet. Look at the nearer pencil with 
both eyes. How does the other pencil appear? Look at the farther 
pencil with both eyes. How does the nearer pencil appear? 
b. Shut one eye. Hold a pencil in each hand about a foot from 
the eye and try to bring the points together. Try it with both eyes 
open. 
4. To show the existence of the blind spot in the eye. 
On a piece of paper make a cross and circle about as far apart 
as the two eyes. 
ar O 
Hold the circle in front of the right eye. Close the left eye. Look 
steadily at the cross and move the paper back and forth till the 
circle disappears.

  CHAPTER XVI 
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 
Tue practical applications of physics and chemistry play 
such an important part in the child’s life that some study of 
these should be made in the science course. The method of 
teaching biological science is largely through observation; 
the method of teaching physical science is largely through 
experimentation. In preparing this chapter the author has 
considered the applications of physics and chemistry in the 
child’s life. In order to illustrate the uses of these applica- 
tions and the principles involved, he has sought to suggest 
a series of simple experiments that can be performed in the 
schoolroom with such apparatus as can easily be secured 
by the teacher and children. 
When the science work in the grades has become better 
organized and its value better understood, apparatus will 
be supplied by the school authorities, as is now done for 
geography and other subjects. Very likely this matter will 
be solved through the extension of the junior high school, 
which permits of departmental teaching and will be furnished 
apparatus similar to that now supplied high schools. At the 
present time, however, little apparatus is furnished for the 
science work in the grades, and hence the need of suggesting 
experiments that may be performed with the simplest out- 
fit. 
The work outlined in this chapter is adapted to the 
grammar and upper intermediate grades.

A. Parts of candle flame 
Apparatus: Candle, piece of glass or cardboard. 
1. Light the candle. After it is burning well, light a match, blow 
out the candle, and then hold the lighted match about a half-inch 
above the candle. Why does it light? Try several times to see how 
far above the candle you can hold the match and have it light. 
2. How many parts do you see in the candle flame? What is 
happening to the paraffin near the wick? Blow out the candle flame. 
Look quickly at the wick and feel of it. What does it contain? 
8. Press a piece of glass or cardboard down on the flame and 
hold for a second or two. What is formed on the glass? How is it 
arranged? 
Hold the phosphorus of a match in the central cone of the candle. 
Does it burn quickly? 
Hold a match or toothpick right across the middle of the flame 
till it begins to burn. Then take it away and blow out the flame 
on the wood quickly. Where did it begin to burn first? 
What do the experiments so far performed show about the 
structure of the candle flame? 
B. Conditions needed for candle to burn 
Apparatus: Lamp chimney with level top, lime water, glass 
tumbler. t 
1. Light the candle. Invert a glass tumbler over it. Why does 
it go out? Light the candle again. Invert over it a canning-jar. 
Does the candle burn any longer? Why? 
2. Light the candle. On each side place a match and on these 
put the lamp chimney. Does the flame act any differently? 
3. Place a piece of cardboard on the top of the chimney. Why 
does the flame go out? 
4. Light the candle and place it on a piece of blotting-paper. 
Put the chimney over the candle and hold it down firmly on the 
paper. Why does the flame go out now? 
What do these experiments show that a candle needs in order 
to burn? 
5. In order to show what is given off when a candle burns, place 
a candle about an inch long in a glass tumbler. Light it, and cover 
with a piece of cardboard. After the flame goes out, quickly re-

  PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 171 
move the candle and pour in some lime water. Cover the tumbler 
and shake. The white substance formed shows the presence of 
carbon dioxide. 
C. Gas and electric meters 
Have the children read both a gas meter and an electric meter, 
either in the school building or at home. Have them note which 
way the hands on the dials turn. Have a drawing made of the dials 
and the hands showing the reading. At the end of the week have 
another reading and drawing made. From this have them com- 
pute how much the cost for a week was of both the gas and elec- 
tricity. 
Have them notice how the gas and electricity can be turned off 
from the meter. 
Il. Water 
A. Some properties of water 
Materials: Small vial and stopper, penny, tumbler. 
1. To make a carpenter's level. 
Fill a vial nearly full of water and cork it. Place it on its side. 
Add enough water so that an air bubble about a half-inch long 
is left. Try this on various surfaces, such as desks and tables, and 
see if they are level. Test by comparison with a regular carpen- 
ter’s level. What property of water does this experiment show? 
2. Gases in water. 
Draw some fresh water from a faucet in a bottle and allow to 
stand for several hours or a day. What collects on the side? Does 
this have any relation to the fact that fishes can live in water? 
3. Effect of water in bending light. 
Put a penny in the bottom of a tumbler. Stand in such a position 
that the edge of the penny is just in line with the rim of the tumbler. 
Pour water into the tumbler and note the change in the apparent 
Position of the penny. 
B. Changes of water from one state to another 
Materials: Tumblers, thermometer, flask, alcohol lamp, tin 
cup, bottle, salt, can with small opening.

172 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
1. Evaporation. 
a. Fill a tumbler half full of water. Pour the same amount of 
water into a plate. Allow both to stand side by side for several 
days. From which does the water evaporate more quickly? Why? 
6. Fill two tumblers half full of water. Place one in the warmest 
part of the room. Put the other ina cool place out of doors if the 
weather is not freezing. Which evaporates faster? Why? 
c. Fill two tumblers half full of water. Put them in a place where 
the wind blows across them. Cover one with a dish. Allow to 
stand. Which evaporates faster? Why? 
d. Fasten a piece of cloth around the bulb of a thermometer. 
Note the reading. Wet the cloth and fan for a minute or two. Read 
the thermometer again. What change has taken place? What does 
this show? What applications of this principle have you observed? 
e. Making water boil with ice. Fill a flask about one fourth full of 
water and heat till it boils. Remove the flask and cork tightly at 
once. Invert the flask and pour over it water containing ice or snow. 
Why does the water begin to boil again? 
2. Condensation. 
Heat some water till it boils. Hold a cold surface above the flask. 
What collects on it? Why? 
Fill a bright tin cup about half full of water. Add snow or ice 
mixed with salt to the water. Watch the outside of the dish. What 
collects there? Why? 
C. Freezing and melting 
1. Temperature. 
Put some ice in a tumbler of water. Place a thermometer in this, 
stirring the water. What is the lowest temperature to which it falls? 
2. Expansion in freezing. 
Fill a glass bottle with water and insert a cork tightly. Secure 
a varnish can, or a molasses or syrup can with a small opening. Fill 
it completely with water. Put the bottle and can out of doors where 
the water will freeze. Examine the next day and see what has 
happened. Examine the crystals of ice. 
Put a rectangular piece of ice in water. Why does it float? Meas- 
ure the part that is above water and the part that is below. What 
fraction of the whole is above water? 
What two changes take place in freezing as shown by these ex- 
periments?
-P-A-G-E-181
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 173 
3. Making ice cream. 
Put a mixture of salt and crushed ice in a tumbler, put in a ther- 
mometer and record the temperature. Try different proportions of 
ice and salt and find which gives the lowest temperature. 
Put a test tube containing water into the mixture of ice and 
salt. 
Fill a tin cup with snow or ice. Place the cup on a board covered 
with water. Stir some salt into the snow or ice. What happens 
to the water on the board and the bottom of the cup? ‘Why? 
D. Pumping water 
When water is pumped, it is forced up through the pipe by the 
weight of the air pressing on the surface of the water. This pres- 
sure of the air may be shown by a number of simple experiments. 
“ Materials: Rubber tubing, or glass tube bent at an acute angle, 
medicine dropper, test tube, glass tubing about eight inches long, 
tumbler, pint milk bottle, hard-boiled egg with shell removed. 
1. Secure a piece of rubber tubing about a foot and a half long. 
Submerge this in a dish of water till the tube is full of water. 
Pinch one end of the tube and bring it out over the edge of the dish 
and -place it over an empty dish set a little lower than the first 
dish. What makes the water flow? Raise the second dish higher 
than the first and notice what happens. A piece of bent glass 
tubing may be used in place of the rubber tube. This is called a 
siphon. 
2. Squeeze the bulb on a medicine dropper and put the end in 
water. Remove the pressure from the bulb. Why does the water 
enter the dropper? 
3. Fill a test tube with water. Place your thumb over the end 
and invert it in a dish of water removing the thumb after the end 
of the tube is under water. Why does the water stay in the tube? 
4, Put a piece of glass tubing in water. Place the finger over the 
upper end and remove from the water. Why does the water stay 
in the tube? Remove the finger. Why does the water fall? Why 
is it possible to drink soda through a straw? 
5. Fill-a tumbler full of water. Over the top place a piece of 
paper and press it down firmly on the rim. Hold the paper on with 
one hand and invert the tumbler with the other. Remove the hand 
from the paper. What keeps the paper up? 
6. Light a piece of paper and drop it into a pint milk bottle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
174 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
After the flame goes out, put a hard-boiled egg with the shell re- 
moved, in the mouth of the bottle. What forces the egg into the 
bottle? 
F. Reading the water meter 
Have the children read the water meter, either in the schod 
building or at home. Have a drawing made showing dial and 
position of hands. Have it read again at the end of the week. 
Compute how much water was used, and how much it cost for a 
day or week. 
Ti. Mzans or TRAVEL 
A. The locomotive 
Usually some boy in the class has a toy steam engine. Ask him 
to bring it to school. Set the engine going and notice what happens 
in the various parts. Help the children to understand the prin- 
ciples involved. 
B. The trolley 
The trolley is propelled by the motor, and the electro-magnet 
is an important part of a motor, so that in order to understand how 
the motor works we will first study the action of the magnet. 
1. The Magnet. 
Apparatus: Two bar magnets, horseshoe magnet, pieces of 
metals, such as iron, steel, tin, zinc, a dime, a copper, a nickel, 
sheets of iron, tin, and zinc, piece of glass, cardboard, thin piece 
of board, such as cover of chalk box, iron filings, darning needle. 
a. Magnetic substances. Take a magnet and try a great many sub- 
stances to see which it will attract. Find the greatest distance that 
a piece of iron is attracted. Put the end of the magnet in a box of 
tacks. Try various portions of the magnet and see which is the 
strongest part. Put the magnet in iron filings. 
Test needles, pins, pens, etc., to see if they are made of iron or 
steel. 
b. Action of magnetism through various substances. Place sheets 
of various kinds of substances such as glass, paper, wood, iron, tin, 
zinc, etc., over a pile of tacks, and hold the magnet over the sheet 
and see if the tacks are attracted. Determine through which sub- 
stances the magnetism does not act.
-P-A-G-E-183
  PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 175 
c. Action of magnets toward each other. (In case a bar magnet 
cannot be obtained, one may be made from a knitting-needle, if 
a horseshoe magnet is on hand, as explained later under e.) Make a 
stirrup of a piece of wire and suspend a bar magnet or a magnetized 
knitting-needle in this by means of a string. Bring the north pole 
of the other magnet near the north pole of the suspended magnet. 
Bring it near the south pole. What difference do you note? Try 
various combinations till you can tell the law that the magnets 
follow. 
d. The magnetic field. 
(1) Place a bar magnet on the table and put over it a sheet of 
paper. Sprinkle iron filings over this paper. Make a drawing 
showing the way the filings arrange themselves. Put two like poles 
of two bar magnets about an inch apart and sprinkle the iron 
filings. Draw. Do the same with two unlike poles. Draw. What 
is the difference in the arrangement of the filings? Place a horse- 
shoe magnet under the paper and sprinkle the filings. 
(2) To make blue prints of the magnetic field. Repeat the pre- 
vious experiments, only, instead of the ordinary paper, use a piece 
of blue-print paper over the magnets. Place in a shaded part of 
the room and sprinkle filings on the paper. Carefully place a piece 
of glass on the filings and put the magnet and all in the sunlight 
and allow to stand till the paper becomes bronze. This will take 
from five to twenty minutes, according to the light. Then shake 
off the filings and wash the paper in several changes of water and 
then dry. 
e. How to make magnets. Rub one end of a needle on one end of 
a magnet, rubbing several times in the same direction. Then rub 
the other end of the needle on the other end of the magnet. See if 
the needle will pick up tacks. The blade of a jack-knife may be 
magnetized by rubbing over a magnet. Try bringing another 
needle near a pole of a magnet, but not quite touching it. See if 
the needle becomes magnetized. 
Break a magnetized needle in two. Test each end of both pieces 
to see if they are magnetic, and if each piece has both a north and 
a south pole. 
2. The electro-magnet. 
Apparatus: Large nail or bolt about six inches long, about 
twenty feet of insulated wire, dry cell, tacks, magnet. 
a. An electro-magnet is an important part of a motor. It can
-P-A-G-E-184
  1%6 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
be made as follows: Wind about ten feet of insulated wire around 
a large nail or bolt, as thread is wound on a spool. Place the end 
of the nail in a pile of tacks. Is it a magnet? Connect'the wire with 
adry cell. Is it a magnet now? Withdraw the nail and see whether 
the coil will pick up fewer or more tacks. Disconnect the cells. 
What happens? Connect the cells again. See if a needle can be 
magnetized by rubbing against the nail. 
b. Test the electro-magnet by bringing it near the end of a sus- 
pended magnet or compass to see if it has a north and south pole. 
Change the connection of the cell so that the current passes through 
the wire in the opposite direction. Test again for the north and 
zouth pole. What difference do you find? 
ce. Wind five feet of wire around the nail and see how the number 
of tacks it lifts compares with the number when ten feet of wire 
were used. Try twenty feet and note the difference. Try two cells 
and compare the number of tacks lifted when one cell is used 
with the same length of wire. In what ways do these experiments 
show that the strength of an electro-magnet may be increased? 
3. Toy motor. 
Usually some boy in the class has a toy motor that he will be 
glad to bring to school. Notice the structure of the motor. Connect 
with a cell and notice how the motor works. Help the children 
to an explanation of the principles involved. 
C. The boat 
1. How a boat floats. 
Apparatus: Spring balance, stone, block of wood, small plate, 
shot, egg, salt, funnel. 
a. To show the buoyant effect of water on a sinking body, weigh 
a stone on a spring balance. Then weigh it while suspended in 
water. How much has it lost? To what is this loss due? 
b. To show the buoyant effect on a floating body, fill a small pail 
as full of water as possible. Set it in a plate. Weigh a block of 
wood. Place it on the surface of water in the pail, catching the over- 
flow in the plate. Find how much the water in the plate weighs. 
How does the weight of the block of wood compare with the weight 
of the water it displaced? Try several pieces of wood. 
Put some shot in a test tube and float the tube in a dish of water. 
Glass and shot are both heavier than water. Why, then, does the 
tube float? Ships are made of steel which is heavier than water.
-P-A-G-E-185
  PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 177 
Why do steel boats float? Add more shot to the tube. What hap- 
pens? Remove some shot. What happens? Why? What fact does 
this illustrate about the loading and unloading of a boat? 
c. To show the difference between the buoyancy of fresh and salt 
water, put an egg into a dish filled with fresh water. What happens? 
Put an egg into a strong solution of salt and water. What happens? 
What makes the difference? 
2. How the boat is propelled. 
Apparatus: flask, rubber stopper with one hole, glass tube, toy 
windmill. 
a. Steamboats are run by the steam engine. The following simple 
experiment illustrates the principle of a kind of steam engine, called 
the steam turbine, that is now being commonly used on steamships. 
b. To make a toy windmill, take a square piece of paper and cut 
from each corner inward nearly to the center. Fold over every 
other point. Pass a pin through the four points and through the 
center of the paper and then into a wooden handle. 
ce. Insert in the flask a rubber stopper with a hole through 
which has been passed a short piece of small glass tubing drawn 
nearly to a point so as to leave only a small opening. Heat the 
flask until the water boils vigorously. Then hold the windmill over 
the glass tubing where the steam is escaping. What makes the 
wheel revolve? 
3. How the boat is guided. 
Apparatus: Compass, magnet, two darning-needles, cork, knit- 
ting-needle, cell, toy gyroscope. 
a. The compass, Note in what direction the needle of the com- 
pass points. Bring the north end of a magnet near the north pole 
of the compass. Then bring it near the south pole. What is the 
difference in the action? 
Connect the two posts of a cell with a wire. Hold this wire in a 
north-and-south direction over the compass and note result. Turn 
the wire around and hold it over the needle. What difference do 
you notice? 
Magnetize a knitting-needle as explained in a previous experi- 
ment (page 175). Fold a piece of paper about an inch square 
diagonally. Place the needle in the crease of paper and suspend the 
paper by means of a thread. In what position does the needle come 
to rest? Move it and try several times. ‘Does it always come to the 
same position?
-P-A-G-E-186

178 _ ‘THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE | 
Magnetize a large darning-needle by rubbing the point on the | 
north end of a magnet, and the eye on the south pole. Magnetize — 
another needle by rubbing the point on the south pole of the magnet 
and the eye on the north pole. Cut two thin pieces of cork from a 
stopper and float the needles on these pieces. In what position do 
they come to rest? Do the points of both needles point in the 
same direction? Can you explain? 
b. The gyroscope. Follow the instructions that come with the 
gyroscope. What is the peculiarity of this toy? A gyroscope is often 
used instead of a compass to guide ships. Can you see how it could 
be used for this purpose? 
4. How the submarine sinks and rises. 
Put the stopper in a bottle and place the bottle in water. Why 
does it float? Fill the bottle with water. Put in the stopper and 
place the bottle in water. Why does it sink? Remove the bottle 
and pour out the water. Insert the stopper and push the bottle 
down to the bottom of the dish and then let go of the bottle. What 
happens? Why? How could this same principle be used in making 
a submarine sink and rise? 
IV. Taxine Pictures 
A. Pin-hole camera 
To make a pin-hole camera, secure a small pasteboard box about 
two inches deep. Cut a hole about an inch square in the cover and 
fasten over this a piece of white tissue paper. In the middle of 
the side opposite make a pin-hole. Point this hole toward a lighted 
candle and cover the head and box with a cloth or jacket. What 
do you see on the tissue paper? What is the position of the image? 
How does the size of the image change as the camera is brought 
nearer the object or taken farther away? 
Hold a reading-lens about three feet from the candle and place 
a white piece of paper behind the lens till a clear image of the 
candle is formed. What improvement has the lens made in the 
image over the one formed by the pin-hole camera? 
B. The ordinary camera 
1. A focusing kodak can usually be obtained from some member 
of the class and brought to school. One lesson may be given on the 
structure of the kodak and the method of making exposures.
-P-A-G-E-187
  PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 179 
2. If a developing tank can be obtained from some member of 
the class for a second lesson, the method of developing films in this 
tank may be shown by actually developing a film. 
8. For a third lesson methods of printing may be shown. Two 
types of paper may be illustrated, the developing, like velox, 
and the printing, like blue print. Prints from blue print can be 
made in the schoolroom during the daytime, and they are very 
easily treated because it is only necessary to put them in cold water 
and then dry them. The blue print may also be used to make out- 
lines of objects, such as leaves, ferns, laces, and other thin articles. 
V. Mersops or TeLiine Time 
A. The hour-glass 
Procure two small bottles of the same size, each provided with 
stoppers. Make a hole in the center of each stopper, and push 
through it a piece of glass tubing twice as long as the thickness of 
the stopper, so that both stoppers shall be on the same tubing, one 
at each end. Fill one bottle with fine sand. Insert the stopper. 
Place the other bottle on the other stopper. Invert the bottles. 
How long does it take for all the sand to fall through? Change the 
amount until it passes through in a definite time, such as two or 
five minutes. 
B. The pendulum clock 
1. Suspend a small pail by means of a string. Set in motion and 
count the number of vibrations it makes in a minute. Put about 
an inch of sand or any small heavy objects in the pail, and see if 
the weight makes any difference in the number of vibrations. 
2. Suspend a stone from a string about a yard long. Start it to vi- 
brating through a small arc and count the number of swings it 
makes in a minute. Set it to vibrating through a long arc and 
see whether the number of vibrations in a minute changes. 
3. Make the string about half as long and see how the number 
of vibrations is affected. Make it longer than the first and note the 
change in the number of vibrations. If a pendulum clock gains 
time, what should be done to the pendulum? What if it loses? 
4. Change the length of the string until it beats just once in a 
second. How long is it? What else besides a pendulum is needed 
to make a clock? What purpose does a pendulum serve in a clock?
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
5. What effect does each of the following factors have on the 
time of vibration of a pendulum: weight, length, and distance 
through which the pendulum swings? 
VI. Some Smet Macuines THAT MAKE Man’s Work EASIER 
A. The lever 
Apparatus: Yardstick, triangular block of wood, jack-knife, 
hammer, scissors, nut-cracker, can-opener. 
1. Place the center of the yardstick over the edge of the prism, 
which is called the fulcrum. On each end place books of equal 
weights at equal distances. What happens? On one end place two 
books and move the prism till the stick balances. Where is the 
prism situated? If the power be placed at the end of the long arm 
and the weight to be lifted at the end of the short arm, what ad- 
vantage does the lever have? If the power and weight are reversed, 
what advantage does the lever then have? 
2. Put the prism at the middle of the stick. Place weights on 
the stick at different distances till the stick balances. Try a num- 
ber of combinations and find the relation that exists between the 
two weights and the length of the arms measured from the fulerum 
to the center of the weights. When using a teeter, how do children 
apply the principles brought out by these experiments? 
8. Use a hammer to draw a nail, open the blade of a jack-knife, 
cut some paper with a pair of scissors, crack a nut with a nut- 
cracker, open a can with a can-opener. In each case explain how it is 
an application of the lever by pointing out the fulcrum, the power, 
and the weight. Find as many other applications of the lever as 
you can. 
B. Inclined plane 
Apparatus: Smooth board about two feet long, spring balance, 
a small toy cart. 
1. Place one end of, the board on a pile of books. Weigh the 
cart. Pull it up the board by means of the spring balance. How 
does the force required compare with the weight of the cart? 
2. Put weights in the cart and perform the experiment again. 
3. Vary the height of the board and see how the power necessary 
to pull up the cart varies with the height. 
4, What advantage do these experiments show that the inclined 
plane has? What applications of the inclined plane can you find?

  PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 181 
C. The screw 
Apparatus: Screw, screwdriver, carpenter’s brace, and screw- 
driver bit, vise. 
1. Measure the length of a screw, and divide this by the number 
of threads in order to get the distance between two threads. How 
far must the hand turn in using a screwdriver to turn in the screv. 
one thread? In using the carpenter’s brace how far must the hand 
move? 
2. Measure the distance between two threads of a vise. How 
far does the hand move in advancing the vise one thread? This 
distance divided by the distance between two threads gives the 
number of times the force applied at the handle is multiplied. 
8. What advantage has the screw? Find as many applications of 
the screw as you can. 
4. Look carefully at the following machines, and write down all 
the simple machines you find in each: a sewing machine, a washing 
machine, a bicycle, a typewriter, and a clothes wringer. 
VII. Eventne ENTERTAINMENTS 
A. The violin and piano 
Apparatus: Box about two feet long, banjo or violin strings of 
different materials and different sizes, three bricks. 
1. Secure a box about two feet long with the cover removed. 
In the board at one end drive three nails, about an inch apart. 
To two of these nails fasten strings made of the same material, 
but of different size. To the third fasten a string made of different 
material, but of the same size as one of the others. 
2. At the other end of the box cut three notches opposite the 
three nails. Pass the strings across these notches and fasten a 
brick to the end of each. Strike a large string and then a small 
string, both of the same material, with the finger. What is the 
difference in pitch? Strike a string of gut and then one of metal of 
the same size and note the difference in pitch. 
8. To one string fasten two bricks and strike it with the finger. 
How does its pitch compare with that when only one brick was 
attached? 
. 4, Halfway down the length of the box place a stick across the 
box under the strings. Hold one string securely against this stick
-P-A-G-E-190
    182 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
and strike the string with the finger. How does the pitch now com- 
pare with that when the string was twice as long? 
5. These experiments show that pitch depends on what four 
factors? Which of these factors are used in determining the pitch 
of the notes on each of the following instruments: the piano, banjo, 
mandolin, and guitar? If you do not recall how all of these are 
made, look them up and report to the class. 
B. The movies 
Apparatus: Toy magic lantern, cardboard about six inches 
square, string. 
1. The moving-picture machine. 
The moving-picture machine is a stereopticon so arranged that 
the pictures are shown rapidly, about sixteen per second. If pos- 
sible, obtain from some child a toy magic lantern. Have the chil- 
dren notice the structure of the various parts. Darken the room by 
pulling down the curtains and show how the machine works. 
2. To learn why we seem to see a continuous set of pictures at the 
movies. 
Cut out a round piece of cardboard about six inches in diameter. 
A half-inch on each side of the center punch a hole with the point 
of a pencil. Through these holes pass a string about four feet long. 
Tie the ends, thus making a loop about a foot long on each side. 
Hold a string at the center with a pin, and with a radius of two inches 
draw four separate arcs of a circle, about half an inch long and 
equally spaced. These lines represent the pictures thrown on the 
screen, and the blank spaces between represent the intervening 
time when the screen is darkened. 
Hold the loop on each side by the thumbs and have some one 
turn the cardboard till the string is twisted. Then pull gently on 
the strings with the thumbs, thus making the cardboard revolve. 
Watch the side with the ares on it and note what one sees. How do 
you explain the fact that these four lines seem to make a continuous 
circle? Erase two opposite lines and then rotate the card. Then 
erase one of the remaining two and try again. Try a line near the 
center and one out near the circumference of the cardboard, and 
see if it makes any difference. Try rotating the disc fast and then 
slow, and note the difference. What determines whether the dashes 
seem to make a continuous circle or not?
-P-A-G-E-191
  
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 183 
In the movies about sixteen pictures per second are thrown on 
the screen, each remaining about one thirty-second of a second, and 
between the pictures the screen is darkened for about the same 
length of time, so that the screen is darkened and has no pictures 
on it for about one half of the time. How does this experiment 
help illustrate what we see at the movies? 
VIII. Curmisrry or tur Kircuen 
A. Acids, bases, and salts 
Materials: Red and blue litmus paper, vinegar, ammonia, lime 
water, lemon. 
1. Pour a little vinegar into a dish. Place in it a small strip of 
blue litmus paper. This is the test for an acid. 
2. Pour a little ammonia into a dish. Place in it a small strip of 
red litmus paper. This is the test for a base. 
8. Dissolve some salt or sugar in water. Put in this a piece of 
red litmus and also one of blue litmus. Does any change take place? 
This is said to be a neutral solution. 
4. Get as many common substances as you can from the kitchen, 
such as lemon, orange, lime water, sugar, sour milk, sweet milk, 
buttermilk, baking soda, cream of tartar, baking powder, tomatoes, 
apple, any fresh fruit, tea, coffee, washing soda, wood ashes. Test 
each one of these with both red and blue litmus paper. Test the 
juices of the fruits. Dissolve the powders in water. Pour water on 
the ashes and then filter. Steep the tea and coffee in water. Place 
the name of each substance in the proper place under the following 
headings: — 
Acid Base Neutral 
B. Hard and soft water 
Materials: soap, test tube, alcohol lamp. 
1. Make a soap solution by heating a little soap in soft water in 
atest tube. Take a little hard water and add to it a measured quan-
-P-A-G-E-192
    
184 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
tity of soap solution. Note the results. Take the same quantity of 
soft water and add the same quantity of soap solution as in the pre- 
vious experiment. What difference do you notice? 
2. Add more soap solution to the first test tube and see if it if 
possible to get a good lather by adding enough soap. 
8. Boil some hard water for several minutes. Then add the 
same amount of soap solution to the same amount of water as in 
the first experiment and see if any better suds are formed. If boil- 
ing removes the hardness, it is called temporary.

  CHAPTER XVII 
WEATHER AND SKY STUDIES 
I. Weather studies 
Weather observations. Many instructive studies can be 
carried on in connection with the weather. One of the first 
things to do is to have the children make observations on 
the weather and have records kept in the schoolroom. These 
may well be carried on for a month in the autumn, a month 
in the winter, and a month in the spring. 
For the primary grades a pictorial record may be kept 
on the blackboard or on a large piece of cardboard. On 
this should be copied, much enlarged, the calendar for 
the month, showing the days of the week and the number 
of the days in the month. Squares or circles of gummed 
colored paper may be taken to represent the kinds of 
weather, a certain color for each kind of weather. The fol- 
lowing colors are suggested for the kinds of days: yellow 
for sunny, black for cloudy, white for snowy, green for 
rainy, and red for windy. 
For the intermediate grades more definite records may 
be kept, as suggested in the following table: — 
  
Precipitation 
Date Temperature Sky Wind 
Kind | Amount 
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Under temperature may be recorded sfbotlier hot, warm, 
cold, or very cold; under sky, whether clear or cloudy; under 
wind, the velocity, whether calm, light, or heavy; under 
kind of precipitation, whether rain or snow; under amount, 
whether light or heavy. 
In the grammar grades more accurate records may 
be made by the use of instruments—the thermometer, 
weather vane, and barometer. 
Weather charts for primary grades. A great variety of 
charts may be made by primary children. Following are 
suggested some topics for these charts: — 
Autumn Work and Play. 
Getting Ready for Winter. 
Signs of Spring. 
Signs of Winter. 
Work which Snow Makes. 
Work which Snow Helps. 
Fun which the Snow Brings. 
Pictures illustrating these topics may be cut out by the 
children and pasted on a piece of cardboard. 
Study of weather maps. In the grammar grades a study 
of weather maps may be made. These may be obtained free 
by writing to the nearest weather station in the State 
where maps are published, and explaining the purpose for 
which they are intended. 
The children should first study the various features of 
the map so that they may understand what they mean, the 
isotherms, isobars, arrows, etc. ‘The weather conditions 
accompanying the low and high areas should be noted. 
By studying maps for several successive days the direction 
in which the areas move and their velocity may be deter- 
mined. Finally, some of the principles involved in weather 
forecasting may be brought out, and the children may try 
to forecast the weather for the next day from the maps.
-P-A-G-E-195
WEATHER AND SKY STUDIES 187 
To find the dew point. The following experiment may be 
performed in the grammar grades. Secure a tin cup with 
brightly polished surface on the outside. In this put some 
snow or crushed ice mixed with salt, and stir with a ther- 
mometer. Watch the outside of the dish and when the 
first dew appears, take the reading of the thermometer. Pour 
warm water in the dish, stir, and when the dew disappears, 
read the thermometer. The average of these two readings is 
the dew point for the room. If all the air in the room were 
to be lowered to this temperature, what would happen? 
IT. Sky studies 
The heavenly bodies are the most common and important 
factors in the child’s life. In the study of science we may 
lead the children to make observations on their changes 
and may teach them some of the more interesting facts 
about them. 
To measure the length of the sun’s shadow. To find the 
length of the sun’s shadow at noon, a shadow stick may be 
made by driving a nail into one end of a board. The length 
of the nail and board should be so adjusted that the shadow 
of the nail falls on the board. Straight back from the nail 
mark off distances in inches, halves, quarters, and eighths, 
so that the length of the shadow may be read at a glance. 
Place the board so that the long axis points north and south. 
At noon measure the length of the shadow, or else make a 
mark on the board and write the date opposite. These 
readings should be made about once a week, and on a cer- 
tain day. Once a month have the position of the end of the 
shadow marked every hour from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. Connect 
these dots with a line. How do these curves compare from 
month to month? Instead of marking on the board, a piece 
of paper may be laid on the board and the marks and curves 
made on this.
-P-A-G-E-196
oe eee ee 
188 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
Have the readings of the length of shadow put in the form 
of a table on the blackboard or on a piece of cardboard. 
At the end of the series of observations have the significance 
of the changes discussed. 
Observations on the moon. Let the primary children 
make a moon chart, similar to that for the weather suggested | 
on page 185. Make a calendar for a month on a piece of 
cardboard. Beginning with the new moon have the children 
report every few days on the shape of the moon. Let them 
cut out a piece of yellow paper to represent the shape of 
the moon as they see it, and paste this on the calendar in 
the proper place. Have this kept for a month. 
For the children in the intermediate and grammar grades, 
more careful and complete records may be kept in the form 
of the following table, which may be kept on the board or 
on a piece of paper: — 
  
Phase Time of Place of 
(shape) setting or rising setting or rising 
  
  
The record of the place of rising and setting may be made 
in terms of the points of the compass. Have the observations 
begin at the time of the new moon and continue for a month. 
Reports should be made twice a week. At each report have 
a drawing made showing the shape of the moon. Have these 
drawings made side by side on the same piece of paper, so 
that by the end of the month the child will have drawings 
of about eight phases. 
Have the children note the position of the moon in the 
sky with reference to-some group of stars, and see if it keeps 
the same position. How much does it change in a week?
-P-A-G-E-197
  WEATHER AND SKY STUDIES 189 
In order to make clear the phases of the moon, color one 
half of a ball yellow with crayon to represent the lighted 
portion of the moon, and the other half black to represent 
the part in shadow. Hold the ball in different positions so 
as to represent the different phases of the moon. 
The stars: constellations. In connection with the study 
of stars the children may be taught to recognize the more 
conspicuous constellations. The best way, if it is possible, 
is to go out with the children some evening. But in place 
of this the observations of the children may be directed by 
the teacher in the schoolroom. 
The first step is to have the children find the Great Dipper 
and the North Star. Then take up the circumpolar constel- 
lations that never set in this latitude; the Little Dipper, 
Cassiopeia’s Chair, the Dragon, and Cepheus. The remain- 
ing stars may be taken up in three groups; the early autumn 
stars, the winter stars, and the late spring stars, each at the 
appropriate time. 
In preparation for the study of a certain constellation, 
the teacher should place on the board a diagram showing 
the position of the stars in the constellation, and should 
explain how to find them with reference to other stars that 
the children already know. After opportunity has been 
given for the children to make observations, the reports 
should be made and discussed in class. Detailed suggestions 
on how to take up the study of the different constellations 
are given in Comstock’s Handbook of Nature-Study. 
Interesting facts about the heavenly bodies. In connec- 
tion with these observations on the heavenly bodies, the 
teacher should explain to the children some of the more 
interesting facts about them. An attempt may first be made 
to give the children some conception of the solar system 
as a whole. In order to do this, diagrams should be drawn 
on the board. Circles may be drawn, of the correct propor-
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
tionate size, to show the relative sizes of sun, moon, earth, 
and other planets. Starting with a dot to represent the sun, 
other dots may be placed on the board to represent approxi- 
mately the relative distances of the various planets from 
the sun. 
The relative sizes could be illustrated by making balls 
out of clay or putty, or by blowing up toy balloons to vari- 
ous sizes. The diameter of the sun is approximately one hun- 
dred times as great as that of the earth. If a balloon is blown 
up to a size of one foot to represent the sun, then a ball of 
putty one eighth of an inch in diameter would represent 
the earth, and another ball one thirty-second of an inch 
(about one half as large as the head of a pin) would repre- 
sent the moon. The sizes of the other planets could be shown 
by balls of clay or putty. 
In the winter-time snowballs could be made out of doors 
to represent the sizes of the various heavenly bodies. If a 
snowball a half-inch through represents the earth, a ball 
four feet through would represent the sun, and one an eighth 
of an inch through, the moon.

   General principles. There are certain principles which 
must underlie all teaching, and these principles must apply 
to science teaching. Still further, there are certain princi- 
ples which must underlie all science teaching, whether in 
Maine or in California. The particular topics taught must 
vary according to the locality, but the underlying princi- 
ples must be the same. 
In times past, there have been those who advised that 
there should be no organized course in science, but that there 
should be a miscellaneous study of whatever materials hap- 
pened to be found by the teacher or children. The need of 
a well-organized course assigning definite topics to certain 
grades is now so well recognized that it will not be necessary 
to discuss it further. 
Basis for organization. The basis for the organization of 
this outline has been sought in the child’s life rather than in 
the subject-matter; and in the interests and needs of the 
child’s present life and immediate future, rather than in the 
interests and needs of the distant and indefinite future. In 
thus stressing the present, the future is not overlooked, for 
ithe fulfillment of the child’s present needs is the best pos- 
ible preparation for the fulfillment of his future needs when 
these may arise. 
The purpose has been to make the outline psychologically 
id pedagogically logical from the child’s standpoint, rather 
an technically and systematically logical from the scien- 
tist’s standpoint. 
The general principle, governing in the selection of topics 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  
194 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
for this outline may be briefly stated as follows: any topic 
is worthy of a place in direct proportion to the number and 
value of the elements which it possesses in common with the 
child’s life. 
Four points of view. The selection and arrangement of 
topics in the outline may be considered from four stand- | 
points: (1) the general aims of nature-study; (2) the phases 
of nature-study included; (3) the seasons of the year; (4) 
the age of the child. 
The arrangement of topics from the standpoint of aims 
and phases has been discussed in previous chapters, and is 
shown diagrammatically in figures 1 and 2. 
The seasons. The natural activities of the seasons have 
been followed, the various plants and animals being studied 
when they are most in evidence. This puts the agricultural 
and biological phases in the autumn and spring, leaving the 
physical, astronomical, and hygienic phases to be taken up 
during the winter. In the autumn special attention is given 
to late flowers, trees, and insects; and in the spring to spring 
flowers, birds, and gardening. 
In the study of trees, the same species is studied through 
one grade in the autumn, winter, and spring, thus showing 
the different aspects of tree activities. 
In the autumn certain groups of cultivated flowers and 
vegetables are studied. In the following spring the seeds of 
these same flowers and vegetables are suggested for planting. 
In the autumn some bulbs are studied and planted both in- 
doors and out of doors. In the winter and spring the flowers 
which develop from these bulbs are studied. 
Such a large proportion of the school year comes during the 
cold months that special plans should be made to improve 
the opportunity offered during the first half of the fall term 
and the last half of the spring term to study plants and ani- 
mals in their outdoor activities. In order that the greatest  
-P-A-G-E-203
BASIS FOR SCIENCE OUTLINE 195 
advantage may be taken of these seasons, a brief seasonal 
outline of topics is given for the fall and spring terms, im- 
mediately following the main outline, suggesting the order 
in which the various topics may most effectively be studied. 
This seasonal outline is arranged to meet the requirements 
of the seasons in southern Minnesota. Some modifications 
will need to be made for States farther south. 
Age of child. The child is the fundamental consideration 
that determines the main features of the outline. For the 
primary grades those plants and animals have been chosen 
which the children could most naturally and easily be led 
to observe, on account of their bright colors, large size, ac- 
tivities, or common occurrence. The chief emphasis is placed 
on identification. 
In the intermediate grades the plants and animals have 
been classified into groups based on their habitat and habits. 
Identification still remains a prominent factor, as in the pri- 
mary grades, but to this are added the idea of adaptation of 
plants and animals to their surroundings, and their classi- 
fication into groups as mentioned above. Children’s plays 
and sports have been made the center around which some 
simple studies in physics have been grouped. 
In the grammar grades the general thought is the relation 
of these various phases of science to human welfare. Two 
centers have been chosen around which to group these topics, 
the home in the seventh grade, and community life in the 
eighth grade. 
Tn connection with the various topics in the outline there 
have been given corresponding children’s problems which 
may serve as the central thought of the lesson, suggesting 
the points to be considered. 
Principles followed in constructing the science outline. The 
principles used in the organization of the outline given in the 
following chapter may be briefly summarized as follows: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-204

196 THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE 
1. The course should cover all phases of clelneiil 
science adapted to the grades. (Biology, hygiene, elemen- 
tary agriculture, elementary physics and chemistry, as- 
tronomy.) 
2. This material should be organized from the child’ 
standpoint, and not the adult’s. 
3: The basis for organization should be found in the| 
child’s needs and interests, instead of in the subject: 
matter. 
4, This basis should be found in the needs and interest: 
of the child’s present life or of his immediate future, ins! 
of in those of the distant future. 
5. The arrangement of topics should depend on th 
seasons. 
6. The course should be adapted to local conditions. 
7. In the lower grades the dominant purpose should 
the esthetic; in the upper grades the dominant purpose 
should be the economic and social. 
8. The topics for the primary grades should deal largel 
with the study of plants and animals; the work for uppe! 
grades should cover all phases of elementary science. 
9. The topics for study in the primary grades should in: 
clude the most conspicuous plants and animals in the child’ 
environment, selected from the standpoint of color, activi 
ties, size, and occurrence.

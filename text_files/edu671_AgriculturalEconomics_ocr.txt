  PREFACE 
Tuts book is intended for the student and the farmer inter- 
ested in the study of those economic principles which underlie 
the effective organization of the farm, and for the statesman 
interested in establishing laws' and institutions for the develop- 
ment of agriculture. The subjects treated correspond to those 
studies grouped under the head of Farm Management in some 
colleges and under the head of Agricultural Economics in others. 
From the author’s point of view these two terms as used at 
the present time cover essentially the same subject matter so 
far as they relate to the economics of production on the indi- 
vidual farm, but he believes that the latter term is much the 
broader, including also the problems of marketing, land eco- 
nomics, farm finance, and farm life. 
The matter here presented is the result of a gradual develop- 
ment of twenty years of study in this field. Its publication 
marks the close of seventeen years of teaching of agricultural 
economics by the author in the University of Wisconsin, where 
he first gave a course to the short-course students in the winter 
of 1902-1903, at which time a “Syllabus of Lectures on Agricul- 
tural Economics” was printed for the use of his class. In 1905 
“An Introduction to the Study of Agricultural Economics,” 
containing thirteen chapters, was published, the main points 
of which have been included in the present volume. For many 
years, parts of the present volume have been mimeographed 
and used in the classroom. 
While the author has been working in this field for twenty 
years he recognizes that the pioneer stage is only now passing 
and that the next few years will result in great progress both 
in research and education in agricultural economics. The 
present treatise is looked upon as being by no means a final 
statement on the subject, but the author’s change of position 
vi

  viii” PREFACE 
and the demand on the part of many of his former students 
for the materials which have been accumulated in his experience 
as a teacher make it seem advisable to publish this volume 
in its present form with the expectation that in a few years 
the rapid development of the subject will make it possible to 
make a much more adequate statement of the subject than is 
here presented. 
The author wishes especially to thank Professors Richard 
T. Ely, T. N. Carver, W. J. Spillman, and G. F. Warren, who 
have been of great help to him from time to time, in conferences 
and through correspondence, in clearing up many of the diffi- 
cult problems in this field. He has also received help from time 
to time from the succession of students who have been in his 
classes. In leaving the classroom to enter upon activities 
in the Government Service the author will miss the stimulus 
which he has received from year to year through contact with 
students. He is hoping that students who have occasion to 
use this book will feel free to write to him in regard to any 
of the subjects discussed in order that he may in some degree 
continue to keep in touch with student thought on this subject.

  AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
CHAPTER I 
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED 
(Tue subject matter of Economics is found in the relations 
arising among men in their efforts to satisfy their wants for food, 
clothing, shelter, and the many conveniences and luxuries of life.) 
(Such a relation arises when one man has wheat to sell and 
another wishes to buy wheat. Here the problem is that of 
agreeing upon the price at which the wheat is to be transferred) 
Other economic relations arise when the use of land is to be 
secured either by lease or by purchase, when equipments are 
to be purchased, and when labor is to be employed. In all 
these cases the relation centers upon the question of price 
fixing, i.e. the agreement upon a rental for land, a price for 
equipment, and a wage for labor. These relations which focus 
upon price determine in a large measure the character of the 
work which men will do, what they will produce, and the methods 
they will use in producing them. Thus it is, that choice of a 
farm, choice of live stock and machinery, the choice of crops, 
the size of farms, the grouping of farm enterprises, the intensity 
of culture, and hundreds of smaller matters which arise from 
day to day have to be settled in terms of the prices of things 
used in production, that is, the cost, and the prices which can 
be secured for the different articles which may be produced. 
The farm manager, in deciding upon what to do and what not 
to do to secure a maximum profit, bases his choices upon relative 
costs and relative prices. 
(here are those who look upon economic problems not as 
problems of production, but problems of distribution, that is, 
the problem of sharing the food, clothing, and shelter among 
B z

2 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  those who want it. Economics has to do with production as well 
as with distribution. If all human wants could be satisfied 
without any effort, there would be no economic problem, neither 
of production nor of distribution.) But while she has provided 
abundant opportunities for producing the means of satisfying 
human wants, Nature has decreed that man must work, — 
“Tn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” Or to give 
Virgil’s version of the same law, 
The sire of all, great Jove himself decreed 
No work save those that task us should succeed. 
(Since it is by work that the wants of men are satisfied, it is of 
general interest that this work shall be so directed as to yield 
the largest possible returns in human satisfaction. Viewed 
from this standpoint it may be said that economics is first of all 
a treatment of the economy of energy required for the satis- 
faction of human needs. It is desirable that the energy re- 
quired for the satisfaction of human wants be used most eco- 
nomically, not that men may work less strenuously, but that 
they may live more abundantly.) 
(Farming is often spoken of as the most independent of all oc- 
cupation, and it is true that the farmer is less dependent upon 
his fellow men than is his city brother. But while the farmer 
is brought into vital contact with other men less frequently 
than is the merchant or the manufacturer, yet, on the other 
hand, he is brought into much more vital contact with Nature. 
The manufacturer, for example, may know each evening what 
tasks are to engage his attention the next day, but the farmer 
simply knows what he would like to do, and awaits the dicta- 
tions of the weather. Socially considered, the farmer may be 
more independent than the man of the city, but he is certainly 
more directly dependent upon the conditions set by his physical 
environment. Much that is characteristic of farm economics 
as a field of special inquiry grows out of this dependence upon 
Nature. This is shown especially in the influence of the sea- 
sons and the laws of plant growth upon the variety of work which 
the farmer performs.)
-P-A-G-E-15
  AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED 3 
{But while the farmer may be more directly dependent upon 
Nature than are those engaged in the industries of the city, 
_ heis by no means independent of his fellow men. ‘The pioneer 
farmer, who looked primarily to the satisfaction of the wants 
of his own household, may have selected the crops which he 
cultivated, without giving any thought to the needs of other 
men; but the modern farmer, who produces primarily for the 
market, and procures upon the market a large share of the 
necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries of life, is bound to take 
into account the demands of his fellow men. The modern 
farmer must consider the price for which the produce can be 
sold as well as the costs of production, if he would manage his 
farm successfully} 
(This close dependence of the farmer upon physical and social 
conditions which are subject to variation from year to year 
makes it unprofitable for him to manage his work by rule of 
thumb. He must follow general principles rather than specific 
tules. He is always being required to adjust himself to new 
commercial conditions. Demands are being made upon his 
judgment many times in the course of each day’s work, as he 
tries to adjust his farm operations to the varying conditions of 
soil and climate, ever holding in mind the demands of his market 
and the cost of each of the agencies of production, namely, 
land, labor, and equipment.) It is necessary that the farmer be 
ever alert. “It is a maxim universally agreed upon in agri- 
culture,” says Pliny, “that nothing must be done too late; 
and again, that everything must be done at its proper season ; 
while there is a third precept, which reminds us that oppor- 
tunities lost can never be regained.” It is, therefore, of ex- 
ceedingly great importance that the farmer have in mind some 
guiding principles which, like the compass, will enable him to 
direct his actions in accordance with a definite purpose. 
(There remains until this day that class who fail to recognize 
the presence of natural laws, and who attribute the unusual 
success of the men of extraordinary ability to dishonesty or to 
foul play of some sort, while to “bad luck ” they ascribe the 
results of their own lack of foresight, lack of judgment, or lack   
 
-P-A-G-E-16
4 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  of industry. These men who talk of “luck ” and who are not 
“willing to attribute to brain and brawn the success of their 
neighbors, may well draw a lesson from the following story, 
related by Pliny, the ancient writer already quoted : 
“C. Furius Chresimus, a freedman, having found himself 
able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far more abun- 
dant harvests than his neighbors could from the largest farms, 
became the object of very considerable jealousy among them, 
and was accordingly accused of enticing away the crops of 
others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day was named 
for his trial. Apprehensive of being condemned, when the 
question came to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had 
all his implements of husbandry brought into the Forum to- 
gether with his farm servants, robust, well-conditioned, and 
well-clad people. The iron tools were of first-rate quality, 
the mattocks were stout and strong, the plowshares ponderous 
and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condition. 
When all this had been done, ‘ Here, Roman citizens,’ said he, 
‘are my implements of magic; but it is impossible for me to 
exhibit to your view, or to bring into this Forum, those mid- 
night toils of mine, those early watchings, those sweats, and 
those fatigues.’ Upon this, by the unanimous voice of the 
people, he was immediately acquitted.” 
It is highly desirable to emphasize the importance of strenuous 
mental and physical effort in winning success in farming. The 
element of uncertainty should not be underrated, for this is 
one of the characteristics of farming; but it should be remem- 
bered that as a rule the chance element is more or less equal 
in a given community, and at a given time, for all those who are 
competing for high rank as farmers. The big differences are 
due to differences in the farmers themselves, in their alertness 
and in the quality of their muscles and their minds. The more 
rational farmers are usually willing to admit that the unusual 
degree of success attained by one of their number is the result 
of hard work, clear thinking, and skillful management. These 
more intelligent farmers are coming to recognize that there are 
fundamental economic principles which, when carefully followed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED 5 
lead the way to success in agricultural production. To under- 
stand these principles is the reason for studying agricultural 
economics.| 
Of the recent writings on agricultural economics in Europe, 
that of Jouzier, a French writer, may be taken to illustrate the 
content of the phrase. ‘‘Philologists,” says Jouzier, “tell us 
that the word economics is formed of two Greek words, which, 
united, mean laws, or rules of the household, that is to say, 
developing the idea which the ancients attached to the words, 
the manner of regulating the relations of the different elements 
composing the resources of the household, whether it be their 
relations to each other or to the members of the household, 
in order to insure the greatest prosperity of the family. fad 
“The addition of the qualifying adjective, agricultural, does 
not change the meaning of the word ‘economics’ at all; it 
simply limits the domain to which it is to be applied. In 
place of saying ‘the household’ we must say the ‘agricultural 
household.’ But, as the agricultural household is the farm 
we shall say that Agricultural Economics is that branch of 
agricultural science which treats of the manner of regulating the 
relations of the different elements composing the resources of 
the farmer, whether it be their relations to each other or to human 
beings in order to secure the greatest degree of prosperity to the 
enter prise. 
“These relations consist in (1) relations of contact (supple- 
mentary, complementary, or competitive) between the different 
branches of the enterprise, such as, for example, the simul- 
taneous raising of cereals and animals on the same farm; 
(2) relations of activity between the different means employed in 
the ¢ process of production, as in the simultaneous employment of 
machinery and human labor; (3) i relations of value, between 
the means employed in production and the product itself; 
(4) m Co commercial relations-with the people to whom farinets 
sell their products or from whom they buy goods. 
“The domain of Agricultural Economics, then, covers the 
examination of each element of agricultural production, whether 
in connection with any one of the above named relationships 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
6 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  in particular, or with several of them together, for the purpose 
of obtaining the greatest net profit. 
“We may consider Agricultural Economics as a science or 
as an art, from a theoretical point of view or from a practical 
point of view. If we consider it as a science or theory, it is 
the knowledge of the laws which govern the above named rela- 
tions; if as an art or practical matter, it is the application of 
this knowledge in a limited, particular environment for the 
realization of results from these relationships.” 
It will be clear from this statement that Jouzier looks upon 
farm economics as (1) the science which treats of the principles 
which underlie the codrdination of all the factors involved in 
farming (land, labor, equipments, and the various lines of pro- 
duction) in such a manner as will enable the farmer to secure 
maximum net profits, and (2) the art of applying these princi- 
ples on a given farm. 
Jouzier’s definition may be accepted as describing that part 
of the field of agricultural economics which relates to the 
organization and the operation of the farm, but it fails to in- 
clude all of the subject matter of agricultural economics as 
conceived in the United States to-day, and it fails to include 
the social point of view which needs to be considered as well as 
the individual point of view when recommending changes in 
our laws and institutions which affect the agricultural interests 
of the country. 
Agricultural economics deals with the principles which under- 
lie the farmer’s problem of what to produce and how to produce 
it, what to sell and how to sell it in order to secure the largest 
net profit for himself consistent with the best interest of society 
as a whole. “\More specifically agricultural economics treats 
of the selection of land, labor, and equipments for a farm, the. 
choice of crops to be grown, the selection of live stock enterprises 
to be carried on, and the whole question of the proportions in which 
all these agencies should be combined, These questions are 
treated primarily from the point of view of costs and prices. 
The economic basis for answering these questions is found in 
the price of land, the wages of labor, the cost of tools, machinery,
-P-A-G-E-19
NT ee ee ee ee ee TT en he mt en eee 
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED 7 
and live stock, and the prices for which the various products 
can be sold. 
Agricultural economics deals not only with economy in pro- 
duction but also with the problems of justice in the distribution 
of wealth among the various classes of society with especial 
reference to the effect of the wages system, the land system, 
the credit system, the methods of marketing, the comparative 
standards of living of country and city workers, and the rela- 
tive opportunities for accumulating wealth by the different 
classes, upon the farmer’s share in the national dividend and 
upon the relative well-being of the agricultural population. 
This subject requires the attention of the agrarian statesman as 
well as that of the farmer. The farmer needs to understand 
the economic forces which underlie his success in order to help 
himself, and the statesman needs to understand these forces in 
order that he may pass helpful legislation with respect to land, 
labor, credit, taxation, marketing, etc., and in order that the 
necessary regulation of the farmer’s activity may be carried out 
with a minimum of reduction in productivity. 
While the economic principles which govern the management 
of farms can be formulated, it should be borne in mind that no 
specific rules can be laid down, which are of general applica- 
tion. Farms cannot be operated by rule of thumb. What is 
right practice at one time is wrong at another time, and what is 
right practice in one place is wrong in another. (The best 
scientific training that could be given to farmers would com- 
prise a thorough knowledge of the physical and biological principles 
which underlie agriculture, the laws of economics which relate.to 
agriculture, and a thorough system of accounting for the purpose 
of testing results on the individual farm.) Any system which 
purports to furnish a complete scheme Of farm administration 
applicable to all conditions, is manifestly either Utopian or 
fraudulent. Such rules must be worked out upon and for the 
individual farm, or at most for well-defined communities where 
the conditions are similar. 
Q Economics is scientifically codrdinate with the physical and 
biological sciences in the study of agricultural problems, The 
 
-P-A-G-E-20

  conditions and forces in the farmer’s environment which in- 
fluence his activities as a farm operator constitute the subject 
matter of agricultural investigation and education. / In the early 
history of agricultural education, the economic aspects of the 
problem of the farmer received a large proportion of the space in 
thebooksonagriculture. Thisis true of the Roman books on Agri- 
culture and it is true of the English works published prior to 1840. 
With the development of Agricultural Chemistry, Agricul- 
tural Physics, Agricultural Bacteriology, Plant Pathology, etc., 
these aspects of the farm problem were brought to the fore- 
ground, and the physical and biological aspects became dominant 
in the publications on agriculture. The chemist, for example, 
has used the most approved scientific methods in his investiga- 
tions. Naturally he has discredited much that was counted 
good doctrine on the subject of agriculture. But while they 
have discredited much that was once held as true, the scientists 
trained in the physical and biological sciences have not been 
able to replace the old with a complete system of knowledge for 
the farmer. Many of the bulletins published by experiment 
stations have been wrought out with great care by the specialist 
learned in some one science and then pieced together with the 
most unlearned notions regarding other aspects of the problem, 
and especially the economic aspects. For example, not long 
ago a chemist made a most careful analysis of some sugar 
beets grown in a given locality. He found the sugar content 
normal, and proceeded to draw the conclusion that sugar beets 
could be grown profitably in that part of the state, without 
giving any consideration to the quantities produced per acre, 
the cost of producing the beets, the cost of marketing the crop, 
the difficulty of securing labor, the relative profitableness of 
beets and other crops which would require labor at the same 
time of year, to say nothing of the tariff in its relation to the 
sugar industry. The farmers wanted an answer to the question 
“ Will it pay us to grow sugar beets? ” The chemist’s work was 
a part, but only a part, of the scientific work required to answer 
the question, but to meet the demand for an answer, the wrong 
answer was given.
-P-A-G-E-21
    AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED 9 
Bulletins of this character have brought home, to the men 
in charge of experiment stations, the truth that every problem 
is many-sided and that no experiment station results are ready 
for the farmer until the many sides have been studied by the 
many specialists with the requisite, preparation, and the results 
welded together into a harmonious statement of the whole truth 
about the question so far as it can be obtained. 
The lack of this rounding out process means the issuing of 
half truths, and it is the issuing of half truths that has done much 
to discredit the experiment stations and to make farmers look 
upon scientific farming as proper fun for men of fortune, but poor 
business for farmers. 
It is in the circle with the other scientists specializing in 
agriculture, devoting himself to the economic forces which in- 
fluence the farmer, that the economist is finding a place. While 
economics deals with but one of the main groups of forces operat- 
ing in the farmer’s environment, yet it practically becomes the 
actively guiding science underlying farm management for the 
reason that while the functioning of physical and biological 
forces change but little from generation to generation, the 
resultants of economic forces are ever shifting, and it is neces- 
sary for the farmer constantly to watch the shifting of economic 
conditions ; that is, the shifting of costs and prices, with a view 
to reorganizing his operations from time to time to fit the new 
conditions. 
It is perhaps for this reason that some writers have used the 
term farm management to describe this field of research and 
education, which we here call “agricultural economics.” This 
usage has the advantage of carrying some meaning to the mind 
untrained in economic terminology, but has the disadvantage 
of including much that is taught in other branches of agricul- 
tural education, and failing to convey any new and significant 
meaning. Literally “ farm management ” is the art of manag- 
ing a farm. To manage a farm intelligently the operator 
should have a clear understanding of all the forces which in 
any way affect the results of his actions. Some of these forces 
are physical and are dealt with by the chemist, the physicist, .
-P-A-G-E-22
  ro AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the geologist, the specialist on soils, or the climatologist ; other 
forces are biological and are dealt with by the plant and animal 
physiologist, the entomologist, the pathologist, the geneticist, or 
the bacteriologist. A third class of forces which have much to 
do in determining what the farmer should do are social, that is, 
they are inherent in the relations arising among men because 
of the pursuit of farming as a means of making a living. These 
are called economic forces. Each of these sets of forces should 
be handled by specialists in modern institutions of education 
and research. If, therefore, the term “farm management ” is 
preferred, it would be well to designate the particular phase of 
the subject. For example, one may properly speak of the 
chemistry of farm management, the physics of farm manage- 
ment, the biology of farm management, and the economics of 
farm management, in which it will be noted that the term 
“agriculture ” as commonly used is simply replaced with the 
somewhat narrower expression “ farm management.” The so- 
lution of this problem of terminology may be to adopt the 
term “ farm economics ” as being both simple and scientifically 
correct. 
The Report of the Committee on Courses of Study of the 
American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment 
Stations in rgrz throws further light upon this subject. ‘‘ The 
subject taught or investigated under the head of farm manage- 
ment, as related to the organization and management of indi- 
vidual estates devoted to agriculture in the judgment of this 
committee necessarily involves the application of the prin- 
ciples of economics. These principles constitute the scientific 
basis of farm management and give this subject its only just 
claim for consideration as having a pedagogical value entitling 
it to a place in courses of study or a scientific standing as related 
to problems of investigation. 
“Tt is true that the farm manager should take into account 
what is taught under agronomy, animal husbandry, agrotechny, 
and rural engineering, but he is chiefly and essentially concerned 
with the application of economic principles to the conduct of 
. his business; outside of economics there is nothing which 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED If 
can give his business a sound scientific basis. The mere col- 
lection of the details of methods of conducting different farms 
will not suffice. There must be the reference of these matters 
to some underlying principles. When this is done it is clear that 
farm management comes within the domain of economics be- 
cause the purpose of farming is to secure a profit from the use 
of the land and its equipment. If profit is lost sight of, the 
farm manager, though trained in all branches of farm practice, 
is doomed to failure.” 
For practical purposes farm economics may be divided into 
the economics of production, the economics of marketing, and 
the problem | of maintaining and i improving the economic and 
social position of the farmer. 
The economics of production centers upon the choice of 
crops and live stock enterprises, the choice and organization of 
the instruments of production, and the principles which under- 
lie economy in the operation of the farm with a view to optimum 
results. The economics of marketing treats of the actual 
movement of produce from producers to consumers, the pro- 
cesses involved, the middleman services rendered, the fairness 
of the charge made for the middleman service, and methods of 
establishing economy and justice in these distributive processes 
through education, codperation, and government activity or 
regulation. The problem of maintaining and improving the 
economic condition of the farmer centers upon those dynamic 
forces which are gradually bringing about changes in the farmers’ 
economic well-being as shown in the ownership of property, 
the standard of living, etc. 
All three of these phases of {farm economics should be viewed 
from the standpoint of the individual farmer who desires maxi- 
mum returns for what-he puts into farming operations and also 
from the standpoint of the statesman who desires maximum 
well- -being for the nation as a.whole. The individual interest 
may conform in the main to the common interest, but where 
this is not true government activity may be essential in order 
to establish harmony of interests. The individual point of view 
should be studied by the farmer that he may know his own

interest, and by the statesman in order that he understand the 
forces he is proposing to control. The national point of view 
should be studied by the statesman in order that he may know 
the extent to which individual interest conflicts with the general 
interest and in order to know the best means of harmonizing 
these interests so far as possible. The farmer, as a good citizen, 
should be interested in the national point of view as well as in 
the individual point of view.\ j

CHAPTER II 
ECONOMIC MOTIVES AND IDEALS IN AGRICULTURE 
Tue primary motive which impels most men who engage in 
farming is the desire for food, clothing, shelter, and the many 
forms of recreation. The primary ideal, then, is to secure the 
maximum results in money or products for direct use per unit 
of effort put forth. 
When one studies man’s motives and ideals, one finds a very 
complex mixture of motives and a great variety of ideals. 
Some of these motives are economic, some are social, some are 
rational, some are irrational, some are emotional, some are 
religious, and others are legal in character. In some instances 
one class of motives dominates; in other instances an almost 
entirely different set of motives will be found to impel the 
farmer to action. 
1. The desire for the means with which to satisfy one’s wants. 
In the minds of many farmers the desire for money stands out 
as the dominant reason for working. In some instances the 
use to which the money is to be put is more or less secondary 
in the mind of the worker. The extreme case is the miser 
who wants money primarily to hoard, or with which to buy 
land for the pleasure of its possession. But the more normal 
form of this economic motive is the desire for money with which 
to buy food, clothing, shelter, and various forms of entertain- 
ment. But even in the single man working for wages, this is 
not the sole factor in determining where he will work or how 
well he will work. There are many direct satisfactions which 
often seem equally important. The way in which the employer 
or his wife speaks to the hired man may seem at times more 
important to him than the money which he receives. Personal 
likes and dislikes, therefore, become very important secondary 
13  
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
factors in impelling men to action. But the sum total of en- 
joyment to be secured by the satisfaction of one’s own individual 
wants is relatively small compared with the satisfactions derived 
from the larger relations of life. 
2. The desire to satisfy the wants of others. A motive of out- 
standing importance with practically all the mature men en- 
gaged in agriculture is the desire for a home and a family. As 
the young man grows older, he thinks less and less of his own 
immediate satisfactions and more and more of the satisfactions 
of others. Pope described this change in his “‘ Essay on Man”: 
Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake, 
As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake ; 
The center moved, a circle straight succeeds ; 
Another still, and still another spreads ; 
Friend, parent, neighbor, first it will embrace, 
His country next, and next all human race. 
Wide and more wide, th’ o’erflowing of the mind 
Takes ev’ry creature in, of ev’ry kind. 
This motive for home and family may be of the simplest in- 
stinctive form, or iv may take the form of great family pride, 
desire for a large and dignified family estate, for education for 
the whole family, for social standing in the higher classes of 
society, etc. In its higher forms this motive is sufficiently 
strong to impel action throughout the whole lifetime of a man 
without completely attaining the ideal. 
3. Pride in one’s work. Many a young farmer takes great 
pride in the straightness of his furrows, in the straightness of 
his corn rows, in the cleanness of his corn fields, in the high 
production per acre of all of his crops, in the fine appearance 
of his work horses, in the high productivity of his milch cows, 
and in the general upkeep and tidy appearance of his farm. 
This is an exceedingly wholesome motive and not only yields 
a great amount of personal satisfaction, but results also in in- 
creasing agricultural production and maintaining the appear- 
ance of the countryside. 
4. The accumulation of landed property. This motive often 
leads men to strenuous activity, when other motives are rela-
-P-A-G-E-27
ECONOMIC MOTIVES AND IDEALS IN AGRICULTURE 15 
tively ineffective. The writer once knew a man who had 
followed this motive to the extreme of acquiring land to the 
extent of about 2000 acres, but his farm presented a very 
shabby appearance, and none of his land was handled accord- 
ing to the rules of good husbandry. When asked by what 
method he was able to accumulate so much wealth he said, 
“Tt is not what you make but what you save that counts.” 
The personal appearance of the farmer as well as that of his 
farm showed the stultifying effect of putting the accumulation 
of wealth ahead of living a satisfactory life. 
5. Joy in work. Many a farmer enjoys driving a team, 
watching the clean soil turned over by the plow, watching the 
crops grow, and caring for live stock. So satisfying is this life 
to many a man that he will continue his activities as a farmer 
year after year, even though he knows that men in other occupa- 
tions are winning very much more money than he, for he is 
wise enough to recognize that he is paid in direct satisfactions 
as well as in money, and that much of the richness of his life is 
due to things which money cannot buy. 
6. Habit. With many an unthinking farmer, habit is the 
substitute for conscious motives. Because he was trained to 
do farm work, he continues to do the work in the same way and 
in about the same amount year after year, and this often con- 
tinues long after he has acquired a competence. Habit may or 
may not be a good substitute for conscious motives. Where 
by habit one follows the higher types of farming the results 
may be as good as if conscious motives were in operation, but 
with the progress of agriculture, farming by habit will ever be 
lagging behind, and for this reason it will usually be true that 
the man with conscious motives will be far ahead of the man 
who works as a result of habit. 
7. The desire for case and time for enjoyment. In that com- 
plex set of motives which dominate the life of man are found 
those which retard his economic activities as well as those 
which promote productive work. This motive is illustrated 
in the laborers of certain races who quit work for the remainder 
of the week so soon as they have earned enough to support them 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
one week. It has been said that in recent years the laborers 
in Porto Rico and many negroes in the southern part of the 
United States, as a result of higher wages, knock off as early as 
Thursday noon when previously with a lower wage rate they 
worked until Saturday noon. Thus, it would seem that the 
economic motive is strictly limited, and that an increase in 
wages instead of increasing the labor supply may sometimes 
reduce the labor supply. Another illustration of this same char- 
acter is found in the farmer who retires in the prime of life 
because he has accumulated a competence. Thus, as the man 
of lower civilization works part of a week in order that he may 
earn enough to live a week, so the retiring farmer of this type 
works only part of a lifetime in order that he may have enough 
to live upon for a lifetime. We have here essentially the same 
motive, the difference being that the latter has a longer-time 
point of view. 
8. Patriotism and community spirit as motives. In times of, 
great national stress and great need of agricultural products 
many a farmer will work longer hours and more strenuously than 
he otherwise would because he feels it his duty to farm more 
and farm better in order that he may in this way contribute to 
the national welfare. It is also true that many a man takes 
great pride in the standing of the agriculture of his native state 
and is willing to do many things to promote the interests of 
agriculture not only for his own benefit, but for the benefit 
of all the farmers of the state. Then, again, the community is 
sometimes the geographic limit of a spirit of mutual helpful- 
ness. A community spirit may become established which 
makes every one desire that his community shall be known 
for its fine-appearing farms and the quality of its products. 
More might be done in the way of stimulating community 
spirit. Public opinion developed by community leaders might 
be a means of getting more farmers to destroy the noxious weeds 
which are spreading from farm to farm and which one man can- 
not eradicate from his farm unless his neighbors attempt to do 
likewise. It is hard to say to what extent public opinion forces 
men to be patriotic and public-spirited in their actions, and to
-P-A-G-E-29
  ECONOMIC MOTIVES AND IDEALS IN AGRICULTURE 17 
what extent this action arises from the independent character 
of the man; but in either case it is effective. 
9. Legal compulsion. The activity of many farmers is in- 
fluenced by legal compulsion. For instance, the law requires 
that milk sold in cities shall contain a minimum percentage of 
fat. It prescribes the maximum number of bacteria and the 
maximum amount of dirt which can be sold with the milk. 
It also prescribes the kinds of weeds which must be destroyed 
before seeding and in many ways regulates the live stock in- 
dustry. To the extent that the farmer possesses right motives, 
legal compulsion is unnecessary, but there are usually some in 
every community who would not live up to the standards laid 
down by law if it were not for the necessity of doing so. 
10. Religion and the idea of duty. In the minds of many 
farmers the religious motive to action is a very important one. 
There are farmers who look upon themselves as stewards of the 
property they possess and feel that it is their duty to handle 
their property to the advancement of religious ideals. There are 
very many who are much influenced in their dealings with other 
men by the ideas of right and wrong which have been established 
by religious teaching. Religious ideas with respect to the keep- 
ing of the first day of the week as a day of rest and religious 
education, as well as the keeping of various religious holidays, 
may to some extent limit the amount of time devoted to agricul- 
tural production and increase the amount of time devoted to 
self-improvement and to the direct satisfactions of life. It is 
probable that if farmers as a class should cease to observe 
Sunday asa day of rest and religious activity and devote seven 
days in the week to farm work, they would get no more pay for 
the seven days than they are getting for the six. It seems to 
be true that city workmen are getting as much pay for a shorter 
day as they formerly did for a longer day. 
With this complex set of motives in operation, it is certain 
that maximum net return in money and in products for direct 
consumption, primary though it be, is too limited an ideal for 
the farmer. 
In the mind of the high-class young farmer, a life for him- 
c 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
18 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  self and his family, in accordance with a high standard of com- 
fort, and right relations in the community, will give purpose 
and force to the primary economic motive and hold it in its 
right position as a means to an end, but not as an end in itself. 
With the passing years, and the accompanying accumulation 
of wealth, the primary motives weaken, and the higher motives 
come more and more to dominate. Without the desire to render 
service to others, there is danger that the latter part of a man’s 
life may be wasted; but with this motive ever strengthening, 
man may continue action. 
The hired man may well have the motive of economic gain to 
stimulate him to earn and accumulate wealth and to strive to 
improve his ability in order that he may climb to the position of 
a tenant farmer, where he can safely assume the responsibility 
of a family. For the tenant farmer, to achieve a comfortable 
living and accumulate funds with which to buy a farm, and 
to be well thought of in his community, is a praiseworthy 
ideal. Later the education of the family and the improvement 
of the farm should be supplemented with some community 
service. The critical moment comes when the farm is improved 
and paid for. Unless the higher ideal of service to others 
comes into the foreground, there is danger of inactivity just at 
the time when the farmer has the capital to farm in the proper 
manner, and just at the time when he is most worth while as 
a community leader, both in economic, social, and educational 
work. 
Stimulating the higher motives. Much can be done to 
stimulate in men the desire to be of service to their fellow men 
by farming well and living in right relations with their com- 
munity. The “ Honorary Recognition ” given to farmers by 
the University of Wisconsin for unusual service in some branch 
of agricultural or country life work is intended to stimulate 
the higher motives in others. The Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company publishes a leaflet entitled “Information for Em- 
ployees and the Public” which stimulates the higher motives 
of the men in its employ. The pictures and life sketches of 
the men who have been trustworthy and public-spirited in

their work are printed by this company and put into the hands 
of all the employees. The local leaders in rural communities, 
and extension workers, agricultural papers, and every other 
educational agency touching rural life should give due em- 
phasis to the broader and higher motives on the theory that 
“ What is honored is cultivated.” 
This sketch of the complex motives which impel the farmers 
to action prepares the way for an understanding between 
the reader and the author on one important question which 
must be agreed upon if the reader is to benefit from the follow- 
ing discussions. The purpose of the author is not to explain 
how men will act under given conditions. The motives of men 
are too complex and too varied for this. What is attempted is — 
to show what it is the economic interest of the farmer to do 
under given conditions. To the extent that this can be done, 
the principles of farm economics will prove a guide to the 
farmer in organizing and operating his farm, and to the states- 
man who seeks to improve agricultural conditions.

  CHAPTER III 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 
THERE was a time when each farm family or each small 
community tried to produce for itself all the food, clothing, 
and shelter necessary to its well-being, — each family carried 
on both agriculture and manufactures. This was the ideal in 
western Europe in the middle ages and it has not been long 
since it was a necessity with the pioneer farmer in America. 
The beginners of American agriculture were Englishmen, and 
the course which they first took in the New World was greatly 
influenced by the stage of industrial progress with which they 
were familiar at home. In the seventeenth century, the greater 
part of the land in England was divided into small hold- 
ings cultivated by tenants or by landowning farmers who 
looked primarily to the production of such crops as were needed 
in their own households. In some parts of the country, how- 
ever, the organization of agriculture had taken on a very 
different form. Large areas of land in the southeastern part 
of England had been made into sheep farms on which wool was 
produced primarily for the market. 
Thus in the seventeenth century, England had two types of 
farmers. The peasant farmer was a hard-working, painstaking 
tiller of the soil who was able to live “ unto himself.” The wool 
and flax which were grown on his little farm were manufactured 
by the farmer and his family into the various articles which were 
desired for home consumption. The peasant’s house was usu- 
ally of simple construction, such as the farmer could make for 
himself out of such materials as could be found in the immediate 
neighborhood. Cottages made of mud and straw were very 
common in the central and northern counties. This farmer 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
DEVELOPMENT OF FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 21 
was just the kind to succeed in a new country where commerce 
could not be counted upon to supply such stores. of goods as 
the wants of men demand,’ 
The second class of English farmers had been in the habit of 
producing primarily for the market, and depending upon the 
market for the supplies of clothing, luxuries, etc., which it was 
their desire toconsume. They had passed on to that stage in the 
evolution of industrial society where the commercial side of 
their agriculture dominated, and without a market they could 
not well survive. Having before our minds these two classes 
of English farmers, let us next take a glance at the country 
which they were to occupy. 
The new country provided new crops, such as maize, potatoes, 
and tobacco, the culture of which could be learned from the 
Indians. The climate of the eastern coast of America is very 
different from that of England, and much colder in winter than 
the settlers may have expected to find in a latitude so much south 
of their mother country. The Atlantic coast presents two very 
different areas: tidewater Virginia, with her mild climate, 
rich soil, and slow-flowing rivers which were well suited for 
becoming the arteries of commerce; and New England, with 
her more severe climate, her poorer soil and rough surface 
traversed by swift-flowing streams which did not lend them- 
selves readily to the purposes of transportation. 
Both of these classes of English farmers came to America. 
The first class, the self-sufficing farmers, got along well in New 
England. They learned to grow maize and potatoes. They 
found plenty of fish in the streams. Their old habits of build- 
ing houses for themselves, manufacturing their own clothing, 
and producing and preparing for winter’s use abundant sup- 
plies of food, made them the natural inhabitants of the isolated 
New England of that time. 
But the commercial farmers were not so successful in the 
North as were their less pretentious fellow countrymen. They 
sought diligently for some agricultural product which could be 
transported to London with profit; for it was from London 
that they could draw the comforts and luxuries which they had 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
learned to consume, but which they were unable, themselves, 
to produce. As it was unprofitable in those early days to ship 
grain to London except in years when the price was abnormally 
high, and as no staple was found which would bear shipment 
to Europe, commercial agriculture was unable to play an im- 
portant réle in New England. 
‘Tn the South, the commercial farmer met with better success. 
There, as in New England, a thorough search was made for a 
staple which would form the basis of a profitable system of 
commercial agriculture. The production of silk was attempted, 
but with little or no success. Wine was looked to as a possible 
solution of the problem, but this, too, led only to disappoint- 
ment. Tobacco was tried with success in the southern colonies, 
and the South was launched upon a career of her own. To- 
bacco had become fashionable in England, and commanded a 
high price. This was the opportunity of the commercial 
farmers. They could produce tobacco and send it by the cargo 
directly from the river wharves on their own plantations to 
the markets of London. This enabled them to order what- 
ever they pleased from the merchants of Europe.” 
The labor problem arose. Free white men could do better 
working for themselves in a country where rich soil was to be 
had for the taking. Contract labor was resorted to, but this 
did not satisfy the demand. The African negro was introduced 
to supply the tobacco plantations with the desired number of 
laborers.’ And thus, it was tobacco and slaves that made com- 
mercial agriculture possible and profitable to the farmers of 
the South and made possible the successful operation of the 
large plantations of Virginia, which were comparable in size 
and dignity to some of the estates of the country gentlemen of 
England. The small farmers were, sooner or later, crowded 
out of the fertile lands conveniently accessible to water trans- 
portation in tidewater Virginia. Plantation agriculture based 
on tobacco, rice, and cotton dominated the South, and it is 
the conditions which have grown out of slavery and the planta- 
tion system which provide the leading problems of Southern 
agriculture to-day.
-P-A-G-E-35
    DEVELOPMENT OF FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 23 
fin the North the self-sufficing economy remained important 
‘ for along time. Small farmers from New England, New York, 
and Pennsylvania gradually moved westward, and it was the 
same conditions which made them successful in the early settle- 
ment of the North that fitted them for the life of the pioneer. 
Since the days of railways, new countries can be settled success- 
fully by commercial farmers, but it was only yesterday that 
the self-sufficing pioneer ceased to be an important factor in the 
development of the resources of the United States. 
“The self-sufficing pioneer farmer was free from the power of 
trusts and corporations, but his life was full of hardships such 
as few farmers would now willingly endure. ) The following 
quotation, descriptive of the life of a pioneer family during 
their first year in their new home in western Pennsylvania, in 
1773, sets forth the hardships of these pioneers in a very pa- 
thetic manner. ‘“ For six weeks we had to live without bread. 
The lean venison and the breast of the wild turkey we were 
taught to call bread. The flesh of the bear was denominated 
meat. This artifice did not succeed very well. After living 
in this way for some time we became sickly, the stomach seemed 
to be always empty, and tormented with a sense of hunger. 
I remember how narrowly the children watched the growth of 
the potato tops, pumpkin and squash vines, hoping from day 
to day to get something to answer in the place of bread. How 
delicious was the taste of the young potatoes when we got them ! 
What a jubilee when we were permitted to pull the young corn 
for roasting ears. Still more so when it had acquired sufficient 
hardness to be made into johnnycakes by the aid of a tin 
grater.” ! 
‘ The agriculture of the North has gradually been transformed 
until now the commercial element dominates. Manufacturing 
was for a long time a household industry carried on by nearly 
every farm family, but in the course of time more and more 
of this work was turned over to those who made a specialty 
of manufactures. The swift streams of New England were 
harnessed and made to turn the wheels of industry. } This 
1 Rev. Jos. Doddridge, Hart’s “American History,” Vol. II, p. 387.
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
movement followed but slowly the path of the pioneer farmer, 
yet in the course of time the older parts of the North became 
noted for their manufactures. With the development of 
manufactures, a market has grown up for the ordinary forms of 
farm produce, such as wheat, oats, pork, beef, and dairy prod- 
ucts. As markets have developed and the means of transpor- 
tation have been improved, the old self-sufficient farming has 
been changed into a commercial economy, until the remnants 
only, of the old system, are now to befound. This change has 
come about because men have found that a given amount of 
economic activity will produce the means of satisfying a greater 
number of wants when each man devotes himself more or less 
exclusively to some one line of. production. This specializa- 
tion in production brings larger returns because (1) some parts 
of the world are especially well suited for the production of cer- 
tain products, (2) some men are especially well fitted for per- 
forming one kind of work while others can best do something 
else, and (3) since the invention of power machines in manu- 
factures large scale specialized production is much cheaper 
than the old handicraft system. 
As a result of the development of commerce in the products 
of agriculture, the modern farmer has found it profitable to 
look primarily to the production of a few staples which can be 
put upon the market in exchange for the great variety of things 
which he desires to use. Incidentally many modern farmers 
produce certain articles, such as fruits and vegetables, primarily 
for the use of their own households, and here they are free to 
follow their own instincts, as did the self-sufficing farmers of 
olden times, and produce those things which they like best to 
consume; but in the production of the staples of commerce 
they must, if they would best succeed, produce those things 
which will enable them to obtain upon the market the largest 
possible means of supplying their wants, in return for the effort 
which they expend upon their farms. 
/ From the point of view of the farmer, then, the first problem 
i before us in the economics of agriculture pertains to the selec- 
| tion of land and the management of a farm in such a manner as 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
    DEVELOPMENT OF FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 25 
will enable, the farmer, one year with another, to win the largest 
net profits.) For example, if a farmer is operating land in a given 
community he sheuld endeavor to determine which grade of 
land to cultivate, which kinds of crops to grow, how intensely 
the land should be cultivated in the case of each crop, and how 
large a farm he should attempt to operate in order that, after 
he has counted out the rent of the land (or the interest on the 
value of the land, the taxes, and the cost of repairs, etc., if he 
owns the land), the expense (in the forms of interest and wear 
and tear) to which he has been put for the use of equipments, 
that is for the use of capital goods, and the cost of hired labor, 
the total net profit which is left to him and his family in return for 
their own labor, skill, and enterprise shall be as large as possible. 
From the standpoint of economy in production, commercial 
( (agriculture is, without question, far superior to the old self- 
\ sufficing system, for it undoubtedly enables the farmers to win 
a large net profit; but from the standpoint of justice in distri- 
bution, the commercial system has been challenged, and there, 
is unquestionably a chance for improvement in this regard. / 
It is believed by many that when a given farmer puts forth a 
certain amount of labor and capital in the production of goods 
which he sells upon the market for one hundred dollars and then 
invests in the various articles which he wishes to consume, 
it will be found that the commodities which he is taking home 
in return for his products were produced by much less labor 
and capital than the amount which he expended upon the com- 
modities which he took to the market. Certainly where such a 
condition exists it is an injustice to the farmer, even though the 
articles which he received in this way would satisfy many 
more wants than he could hope to satisfy if he tried to produce 
for himself every article which he consumes. 
It has been alleged that there are men who do no work, but 
( simply sit at certain points where exchanges are made and 
demand that their baskets be filled. To avoid this alleged 
injustice in the distribution of wealth, it has been proposed 
that “Farming Corporations” be organized, and that these 
corporations make it their business to produce for themselves
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
everything they want to use. It is proposed that no attention 
shall be paid to the commercial world nor to commercial values, 
but simply to the wants of the farmers and their families. 
Every kind of agricultural product which may be desired for 
use by the members of this corporation is to be produced by 
them. Wool is to be produced and converted into clothing, 
beef is to be produced for home use, and the hides of the animals 
converted into shoes for home use. Thus to avoid unjust 
treatment it is proposed to throw away many of the advantages 
of the commercial system and revert the old self-sufficing system 
in agricultural production. / 
L. H. Kerrick, who lived at Bloomington, Illinois, and who 
was in his lifetime a leading and successful farmer of that state, 
delivered an address at the Iowa Agricultural College, Ames, 
Iowa, a few years ago, in which he said in part: 
“The farmer has, in my region certainly, become too much im- 
bued with the spirit of commercialism. He has gone too far, I 
think, in the way of producing things to ‘sell.’ He raises big crops 
of corn and oats to sell, or feeds many cattle and hogs for the market. 
He sells these at the other fellow’s prices. Then he turns about 
and buys, at the other fellow’s prices, supplies of various kinds that 
he might easily have produced on his own farm. By this practice 
he puts himself twice in the enemy’s hands — once when he sells, 
and again when he buys. This is not the highest and best idea of 
living by farming. The first thing a farmer should do is to surround 
himself in his farm home with everything he can make or produce 
that will promote the health, comfort, safety, and pleasure of him- 
self and family. This is what the farm is for, first. And how few 
good and needful things there be that may not be produced and 
provided on a good farm and in and about a real farm home! I do 
not attempt to name the innumerable good things of his own garden 
and orchard and field —all prime, fresh, and exactly to his liking, 
which the provident farmer may have if he can only get that idea of 
raising things to sell out of his head or at least modified, and get 
that other idea of producing things on his own farm for his own 
use. If farmers everywhere would think first and work first to pro- 
vide for their wants on their own farms, then they might be able to 
set the price on the surplus they have to sell. Then the surplus 
1 Wilber Aldrich, Farming Corporations, p. 169.
-P-A-G-E-39
  DEVELOPMENT OF FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 27 
would not be so overwhelming in volume. Then there might be 
competition among the buyers of his surplus. The consumer might 
not then be so able as now to sit complacently waiting to be solicited 
to buy this enormous surplus at his own price. The railroad people 
then might take on better manners and be willing to give a more 
nearly just rate, and they might be more careful to give good service. 
“The farmer with the right idea of farming and of farm life and 
of farm opportunities is the man I have most faith in to curb trusts 
and corporations generally — such as need curbing. 
“The makers of machines and implements and of barbed wire and 
of all that sort of thing cannot eat their stuff — they must sell to 
get any good out of their product. They cannot live at all without 
selling. But the right kind of a farmer can live a long time without 
selling his product — he can eat it and live. Suppose the other 
fellow asks you an exorbitant price for his wares. Just let him keep 
them, because he can’t eat them; and to get something to eat, 
he must sell. But you, my farmer friends, can keep yours a while 
and be living like kings — eating your bread and meat and good 
apples and fresh butter and eggs and milk. The other fellow can 
only keep his just a little while, until you hear the prices of his wares 
are cracking. The farmer is a trust breaker, if he only knows it. 
I have little faith in legislatures and courts and magazine writers 
and orators, as trust breakers. But the farmer with the right idea, 
as I have been trying to illustrate, can fortify himself in his farm 
home for a much longer siege than the manufacturer or the railroad 
manager can put up against him. And the beauty of it all is, the 
farmer can be happy all the same, and all the time.” sgt s 
That too many farmers neglect to provide their families with 
the variety and abundance of fruits and vegetables which they 
might and should produce primarily for home use, and that 
they also generally fail to appreciate the possibility of creating 
for themselves beautiful surroundings by planting flowers and 
shrubs and trees, is frankly admitted. This condition of affairs 
is to be regretted, and should be remedied. One of the great- 
est of economists, John Stuart Mill, has said, “ Solitude in the 
presence of natural beauty and grandeur is the cradle of 
thoughts and aspirations which are not only good for the in- 
dividual, but which society could ill do without.” !

We need more of the “ thoughts and aspirations ” such as the 
“natural beauty and grandeur ” of the ideal country home may 
inspire, and it is certainly to be hoped that the American farmer 
will avail himself of his natural opportunities and surround him- 
self with everything which will add to the dignity and beauty of 
his home. 
But if these beautiful surroundings are to be created they must 
first be desired by the farmers, and it will certainly be admitted 
that the desire for food, clothing, and shelter naturally and prop- 
erly come first and should be satisfied before much attention 
is given to the creation of beautiful surroundings; and, again, 
to enjoy the beautiful surroundings, one must have leisure, and 
in order to have time, after satisfying the more urgent wants, 
to create and enjoy beautiful surroundings, it is important that 
the farmer avail himself of the most economical means of satisfy- 
ing these wants. We object, therefore, to the general principle 
laid down by Mr. Kerrick, that farmers everywhere should 
“think first and work first to provide for their wants on their 
own farms,” rather than look primarily to the production of 
those things which will give them the greatest purchasing 
power in the market. We believe the latter method to be the 
one which will bring the largest means of satisfying wants for a 
given amount of exertion, whereas, Mr. Kerrick’s suggestion 
points towards a reversion to the self-sufficing economy of 
earlier times, and to a sacrifice of much of the benefit which has 
resulted from the extension of commerce and from specializa- 
tion in industry. 
There are, doubtless, many injustices in the present complex 
commercial system of agricultural production; but, in spite of 
this objection, the commercial system is superior to the old self- 
sufficing economy which was desirable only in an earlier stage 
of economic society when the dangers to commerce were so 
very great and the means of transportation had been so little 
developed that the farmers could gain little or nothing by pro- 
ducing for the market. Modern agriculture is not entirely 
commercial, yet production for the market is the dominant 
feature. The commercial system has replaced the self-suffic-
-P-A-G-E-41
    DEVELOPMENT OF FARMER’S ECONOMIC PROBLEM 29 
ing system because it brings larger returns for the efforts ex- 
pended, and our aim should be, not to revert to a less econom- 
ical system in order to avoid the evils which have arisen, 
but to remove the evils which accompany it and thus perfect 
the present commercial system. 
G When the farmer follows the rule of seeking the largest net 
profits, he will not be bound to any one system, he will produce 
for home consumption just to the extent that he can do so 
more economically than to buy upon the market/ That which 
is good practice in this regard at one time and place may be 
bad economy at the same time in another place, and in the same 
place at another time. 
fs Producing for the market has made farm management a 
complex problem. The farmer can no longer look within the 
limits of his own domain and find all the information needed 
for the guidance of his husbandry. If the farmer would succeed 
he must give heed to the demands of millions of people, most 
of whom he does not and cannot hope to know. ) He must give 
thought also to other farmers who may be padlocate the same 
article for the market. His knowledge of what other farmers 
are doing is limited to such statistical information as can be 
secured by public and private bureaus of information regarding 
what has recently been produced. Fortunately, the farmer 
finds in market prices the record of the present results of supply 
and demand and may use prices thoughtfully studied through a 
long period as a guide to his future actions. The physical and 
biological environment given, the prices of the products and 
the prices of the agencies of production — land, labor, and 
equipments — determine what to produce and how to produce 
it in order to secure maximum profits. 
/The commercial economy, with its farm machinery, its eleva- 
G tors, its mills, its packing plants, its railway and steamship 
lines, has made the total labor of the people much more produc- 
tive. Every one is benefited. Where some are receiving 
more than a fair share, a remedy must be provided through such 
control of the marketing system as will give a fair share of the 
proceeds to each one who helps in their production, but the  
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
farmer should, so far as possible, take advantage of the great 
economy in production due to the commercial system. The 
farmer should study his soil, his climate, his labor force, his 
market, and his costs, and adjust his farm operations in such a 
manner as will enable him to win a maximum profit in cash and 
direct satisfactions. 
The state should so regulate the marketing system, especially 
with regard to the sharing of the consumer’s dollar among those 
who produce the goods, that the farmer will be in a position to 
live as well and save as much from his earnings as those of 
similar ability with like investments engaged in other occupa- 
tions. If this is not done, there is danger that those in other 
occupations will gradually accumulate wealth, buy land, and 
in the course of time make the farmers subject to them as land- 
lords. The objective point in agricultural-economics-is the well- 
being of farmers as an integral part of a nation. This well- 
being demands justice in distribution as_well.as_economy. in 
sproduction. / Both of these goals are kept in mind as the 
purposes in view in the chapters which follow.
-P-A-G-E-43
  CHAPTER IV 
ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 
Tue purpose of farming is to produce goods which are needed 
directly or indirectly to satisfy the wants of man. Any material 
thing or personal service which directly or indirectly satisfies 
a human want is called a good. Tobacco satisfies a want, 
hence it is a good, in the sense in which the word is used in 
economics. It may seem like a paradox to call a bad thing a 
good; but this will be understood when one bears in mind that 
it is economic qualities rather than moral qualities that are here 
being considered. Goods satisfy desires. Desires may be 
moral or immoral. Ruskin divides all goods into two classes, 
those the use of which he approves he calls wealth, those the 
use of which he disapproves, because he thinks they are detri- 
mental to man, he calls “ illth.” 
Economic goods. Some useful goods are generally found 
without any effort on the part of man in great abundance in the 
form, at the place, and at the time they are needed. Such 
goods are called free goods. Air, for example, is a free good. 
But when a person commences to make a list of the things he 
wants, he finds free goods rather infrequent on the list. For 
most goods some effort must be put forth in order to secure a 
supply. For example, farm products, the products of the mines, 
and the products of the factories all require effort in their pro- 
duction, hence they are limited in quantity and are called 
economic goods. 
Causes of scarcity. Goods which can be increased in supply 
indefinitely by the use of land, labor, and capital are scarce 
because of the labor and sacrifice required in their production. 
This may be called cost of production scarcity. This class in- 
cludes most agricultural products. It will be recognized that 
31
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
while in the long run the supply of farm crops depends upon the 
activities of man, it is also true that variations in seasons and 
the attacks of pests influence greatly the supply produced in 
any one year. The acreage of a given crop is in the control of 
man, but the production per acre is in so large a measure de- 
termined by the weather that the total production in any one 
year is very uncertain, hence the degree of scarcity of farm 
products in a given season is in a large measure the result of 
natural forces beyond the control of man. 
The degree of scarcity of economic goods is in many cases 
influenced by men who are in aj position to limit the supply with 
a view to demanding a price higher than would prevail under 
competitive conditions. Scarcity created in this way is called 
monopoly scarcity. Monopolies arise out of natural con- 
ditions and out of laws granting patents, trademarks, copy- 
rights, etc. The occasion of monopoly is not the size of the 
business or the character of the organization, but the essential 
unity of control. Unity of control makes it possible to limit 
supply in such a manner as to command a price which will 
yield maximum total profits for the monopolists. It is in this 
sense that we speak of monopoly scarcity. 
Economic goods may be scarce because of an absolute limi- 
tation on the supply, that is, there is no way of increasing the 
supply. Absolute scarcity may be permanent or temporary. A 
beautiful picture painted by an artist who has passed away has 
been given as an example of absolute scarcity which is per- 
manent. Here there is no chance of increasing the supply of 
originals at any time. 
Absolute scarcity may exist temporarily in many farm prod- 
ucts. This is a matter of great interest to the farmer. When the 
wheat crop of the United States and Canada has been harvested, 
nine months pass before the supply can be increased from this 
source. If the supply is not enough for the normal demand, 
_ prices tend to rise and the demand fall until there is a balance 
between the supply and the demand. The prospect for a new 
crop may be unusually good, but the new crop to be harvested 
in July cannot be used in June. The supply of old wheat is 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 33 
temporarily in the class of absolutely scarce goods. Potatoes 
would serve as another example of temporary absolute-scarcity 
goods. 
Goods must be both useful and scarce in order to be 
classed as economic goods. Goods may be useful because they 
possess certain physical and chemical properties ; for example, 
wheat contains starch and gluten which makes it a valuable 
food, and cotton fiber possesses tensile strength which makes it 
useful in the manufacture of cloth. This is called elementary 
utility. Goods are useful because of the elements they possess. 
Wheat when transformed into bread has additional utility. 
Cotton fiber has additional utility when transformed into 
clothing. This kind of utility is called form utility. 
When the flour and the clothing have been manufactured, 
they may be a long way from the men who are to use them. 
By shipping them to the places where they are most wanted 
they are more useful. In this way place utility is added to them. 
The wheat crop is harvested largely in one season and con- 
sumed the year around. Those who store the wheat or flour 
for many months in order that consumers may eat bread the 
year around have added time utility to these goods. 
It has been suggested that the advertiser adds utility to the 
goods. The fact would seem to be that advertising operates 
on the prospective consumer rather than upon the goods and 
changes his state of mind regarding the goods. This may in- 
crease the individual estimate of the importance of a given 
elementary utility or a given form utility. 
Some goods will stand long shipment and long storage with- 
out danger of deterioration. For example, wheat, wool, and 
lumber are in little danger of deteriorating in shipment and 
storage. These we shall call durable goods. Other goods are 
in great danger of deterioration in transit and cannot be kept 
long in their original form. Strawberries and milk are examples. 
They have commonly been called perishable goods. One of the 
triumphs of modern inventive genius is the successful conver- 
sion of perishable goods into durable goods by dehydration, 
canning, and other methods of preserving. 
D 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Economic goods may again be classified as permanent and as 
temporary goods according to the number of times used. For 
example, a piece of cotton cloth may be used many times and 
through a series of years, hence it is here called a permanent 
good, whereas wheat flour, in the form of bread, is used but 
once and is called a temporary good. 
There is a close relation between the degree of scarcity of 
a good and the intensity of the desire which people will have for 
it. Other things being equal the greater the scarcity of a given 
good, the higher will be the intensity of the desire for it; the 
greater the abundance, the lower the intensity of the desire. 
Common observation teaches us that the more completely one’s 
desires for a given article are satisfied the less he will give for 
an additional supply of that good for his own use. The con- 
verse of this fact is that in order to induce people to consume 
more products it is necessary to lower the price to correspond to 
the reduced satisfaction resulting from the additional units of 
goods consumed. At a higher price less will be consumed; 
at a lower price more will be consumed. 
It is obvious that the quantity of the various farm products 
demanded will depend upon a number of conditions. Other 
things being equal, (1) the higher the individual estimates of the 
importance of the goods in the minds of the great mass of consumers, 
the greater will be the demand. (2) The greater the incomes of 
the consumers, the greater the demand for goods. (3) On the other 
hand the very thing which great demand tends to create, namely, 
high prices, tends to reduce the demand so that the demand 
varies inversely with the price. 
The exchange value of goods. It has been seen that in 
order to be economic goods, that is, goods with a value placed 
upon them, goods must be both useful and scarce. There is a 
great difference in the usefulness and in the abundance or 
scarcity of different goods; hence there is a corresponding dif- 
ference in their exchange values. Exchange value has been 
defined as the quantitative ratio in which goods or services are ex- 
changed. For example, if one bushel of wheat will exchange for 
two bushels of oats we think of wheat as worth twice as much
-P-A-G-E-47
    ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 35 
per bushel as oats. For the sake of convenience it has become 
the custom to value all other articles in terms of one article 
which is made by law the standard of value. In most countries 
gold is the commodity decided upon as the standard of value. 
The amount of gold for which a definite amount of a given 
commodity will exchange is called the price of that commodity. 
In other words, price is value expressed in terms of the standard 
of value, or as we commonly speak of it, in terms of money. The 
value of farm products may remain the same, when expressed 
in terms of each other, and yet the prices of these products 
may all change because of a rise or fall in the value of gold. 
The value of a given weight of gold (25.8 grains 9 tenths fine) 
may be looked upon as the measuring stick with which the 
values of other products are measured. 
The exchange value of a specific good at a given time is de- 
termined by its relative abundance, that is, by the supply in 
relation to the demand for this good when compared with 
other goods. 
Behind the fact of demand, as has been noted, is the more 
fundamental fact of human wants. The desire to satisfy 
wants impels men to produce supplies of utilities, z.e. things 
which satisfy wants. The effort which man must put forth in 
order to gain the means of satisfying his wants sets a limit 
to the supply of economic goods. It usually happens that long 
before all of the wants of a man are satisfied, the pain of exer- 
tion becomes so great that it more than balances the possible 
pleasure which might be produced by consuming the products 
of further exertion. So long as there is an unsatisfied desire 
for an article, that article will have some value placed upon it. 
The relative intensity of the buyer’s desire for an article deter- 
mines how highly he will value it, and what price he will be 
willing to pay for it; but the price which must be paid deter- 
mines how much of the goods he will take for his own use and 
how completely the want will be satisfied. In short, the higher 
the price the more intense will be the desire which will be left 
unsatisfied. 
On the other hand, the natural facilities for increasing the
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
supply will determine how high the price must be before the 
producer can afford to increase the supply. Marshall says, 
“ For long periods the supply price is that which is just needed 
to call forth those new investments of capital, material and 
personal, which are required to make up a certain aggregate 
volume or production.”! The higher the cost at which the 
producer adds an increment to the supply, the more limited the 
total supply that will be put upon the market; but the smaller 
the amount of an economic good consumed, the more intense 
is the desire for it and the higher it is valued. Thus it is that 
the marginal utility, or the intensity of the last want which is 
satisfied, tends to adjust itself to the cost of producing that share 
of the supply which is produced under the most unfavorable 
circumstances. But it is also true that the price which is 
offered at a given time, and which corresponds to the marginal 
utility at that time, determines the maximum amount which 
can be expended in the production of a given article with profit, 
and hence determines ultimately how far down the scale of 
less and less favorable circumstances its production can be 
carried on. Thus it is that the forces which lie behind the 
demand for an article, and the conditions under which the 
article may be supplied, regulate its price. 
Causes of fluctuation in values. Values may fluctuate from 
year to year because of changes in the quantity produced, or 
changes in the quantity demanded, that is, changes in the 
supply or in the demand. Fluctuation in the annual produc- 
tion may be due to the climate, to the ravages of insects, or to 
the conscious changes in the plans of a considerable proportion 
of the producers. The more durable the product the less the 
value will fall as the result of an unusually large crop. A por- 
tion of the supply can be held over until the next year. The 
fact that wheat can be held over at a relatively small cost and 
without losing its usefulness, while potatoes of one year’s 
production have little or no value after the new crop becomes 
generally available, explains, in part, why a given variation in 
the wheat crop influences the price less than the same propor- 
1 Alfred Marshall, “Principles of Economics,” third edition, p. 448. 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 37 
  tional variations in the potato crop. The prices of farm prod- 
ucts are influenced by the fact that most of the supply of a 
given product becomes available during a small portion of the 
year, and this supply must last until the next year’s supply is 
ready for use. A factory manufacturing steel rails, copper 
wire, or cotton cloth may put out a continuous flow of goods, 
but with most farm products the output is intermittent. 
The tendency is for the price to be low when the greatest 
supply becomes available, and high in the period prior to 
the arrival of the new supply. This is due to the fact that a 
part of the supply must be stored, which involves the expense 
for storage room, interest on the money invested in the prod- 
uct, and a loss due to shrinkage. 
The variation in demand due to changes in prices is very dif- 
ferent with different classes of goods. For some goods the de- 
mand is very stable; for others it is very elastic. Where the 
demand is stable it takes a big change in prices to force people 
to make any changes in the amounts consumed. On the other 
hand, where the demand is elastic the quantity consumed tends 
to fall off rapidly with increased prices or decreased supplies 
of money to spend. By elasticity of demand is meant its 
sensitiveness to changes in the price as a result of changes in 
the quality or the quantity of the product or in the purchasing 
power of the commodity. A stable demand is one which is 
not easily influenced by changes in these conditions. The 
demand for bread and for potatoes is fairly regular throughout 
the year, and a considerable change in price is required to make 
any important change in the demand, hence, the demand for 
these articles may be said to be inelastic, or stable. On the 
other hand, the demand for eggs varies greatly during the year 
in response to changes in the price and in the quality of the 
supply, hence the demand is said to be elastic. The more 
readily a substitute can be found the more elastic will be the 
demand, and the less will prices fluctuate as a result of changes 
in the supply. Where substitutions are easily made the quality 
of the product affects greatly the quantity demanded. If the 
first order of cabbages made by the housewife turns out to be  
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of poor quality she is likely to try some other vegetable the 
next time. In this way the poor quality of one man’s products 
may reduce the price which another man may get for first-class 
goods. This illustrates what is called solidarity of interest. 
The demand is steadier for established grades, that is, goods 
of standard qualities, than for unstandardized articles. Many 
people will buy a given article if they are sure of securing goods 
of high quality who, when in doubt, refrain from making the 
purchase. This places a premium upon goods of known stand- 
ard of quality over what goods of the same quality would 
command if sold in an ungraded mixture along with goods of 
varying quality. Standardization is one purpose of trade- 
marks. The trade-mark is of high value only when it stands 
for an established quality that can be counted upon. The 
name of the farm might well be placed upon the label of the 
milk and cream bottles, or stamped upon the eggs, the berry 
boxes, the apple barrels, the grape baskets, etc. The regis- 
tration of farm names for this purpose, giving the exclusive 
use of a given name to a given farmer, might well be made 
possible by legislation. This use of a trade-mark will enable 
the purchasers to buy with a knowledge of the character of the 
producer, and would result in a greater range in prices due to 
variations in the quality of the goods. This would put a pre- 
mium on the production of goods of high quality and be an 
effective stimulus to good agriculture. 
The individual farmer is often not in a position to incur the 
expense of advertising a given brand of products to such an 
extent as to establish a reputation beyond the limits of the local 
market. Community action is often essential to the establish- 
ment of brands of farm products on distant markets. Com- 
munities have succeeded in establishing brands of fruit and 
other perishable products. The apple growers of the Pacific 
northwest, the grape growers of New York, the butter and egg 
producers of Denmark, are conspicuous examples. 
Costs and prices. It has been common to hear the statement, 
“ The price should be high enough to pay the cost of production 
and a reasonable profit.” This phrase when properly under-
-P-A-G-E-51
    ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 39 
stood is full of significance. It is a misinterpretation, however, 
to assume this phrase to mean that every producer of a given 
product has a right to expect and to demand a price which will 
cover his costs and give him what he considers a reasonable 
profit. There are many causes of variation in costs: (1) varia- 
tion in natural conditions, such as soil and climate of the dif- 
ferent areas producing a given crop, (2) variations in the abun- 
dance of labor in the different localities, (3) variation in the 
kinds of equipments which can be made use of, (4) variations 
in the distance from the market, and (5) variations in the effi- 
ciency of the farmers who give direction to the work on the 
different farms. As a result of the wide variations in the 
efficiency of the instruments of production, it usually happens 
that there is an inefficient producer here and there who is pro- 
ducing at a cost greater than the price at which other farmers 
find it profitable to produce enough to supply the market. 
If the price were artificially pushed up to a point where the in- 
efficient farmer can make a profit, this would make the enter- 
prise exceedingly profitable to the efficient farmers, and would 
tend to increase their production, the greater supply would 
force prices down, and the second state of the inefficient farmer 
would be worse than the first. Some of those who are produc- 
ing at a loss might well change to some other line of production 
in which their qualifications count for more. It often happens, 
for example, that a low grade dairyman is a high grade tobacco 
producer, that a low grade grain farmer can make money in the 
grazing of cattle. Every farmer should strive to get into the 
field of work in which he is best able to compete. 
Low efficiency of the farmer in a given line of production 
is only one of the causes which may result in costs which exceed 
prices. For example, the wheat regions of the world are 
numerous and widely scattered. The cost, per bushel, of pro- 
ducing wheat and putting it upon the world’s central wheat 
market, Liverpool, vary greatly. During periods when the 
supply of wheat is increasing slowly and the demand for wheat 
is increasing at a slightly more rapid rate, the price of wheat 
will tend to remain high enough to retain the wheat industry
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
in the region where the costs are greatest. When, however, as 
a result of a new discovery or the extension of means of trans- 
portation a new and fertile wheat region enters into competition 
with the old regions, it may happen that the supply of wheat 
will increase more rapidly than the population, and to induce 
the people to consume more wheat per capita the price must 
be lowered. As a result of the fall of wheat prices some of the 
old wheat regions find their costs greater than the prices they 
can get, and will find it necessary to change to some other crop. 
This condition was brought about in the wheat industry when 
the fertile wheat regions of Kansas, Minnesota, and the Dakotas 
were made accessible and poured their abundant supplies of 
grain upon the markets of Europe. The farmers of England 
found wheat growing a losing enterprise. Had they understood 
the cause of the fall in wheat prices they would have known that 
the one thing to do was to drop wheat growing and take up some 
other line where foreign competition was not so keen. After 
a long time this came about, the wheat lands were converted 
into meadows and pastures, and the dairy industry paid well 
for the efforts expended. Unfortunately many farmers held 
to wheat production long after it ceased to yield a profit. In 
some cases this resulted in bankruptcy which alertness to the 
price situation might have avoided. 
We are not without illustrations of this principle in this 
country. The falling wheat price due to the rapid growth of 
the wheat industry in the Northwest was an important factor 
in driving Wisconsin farmers from a system of grain farming 
with wheat as the money crop into the live stock industry 
with dairy products as the chief sources of income. 
The westward movement of the wheat industry in the North 
was paralleled by the westward expansion of cotton production 
in the South. From the old centers in Georgia and the Caro- 
linas, the cotton industry extended into the fertile “ Black 
Prairie of Alabama,” sprang up in the rich alluvial of the Mis- 
sissippi and confluent rivers, and in the Black Prairie of Texas. 
The result was a rapid increase in the quantity of cotton pro- 
duced. The increased supply was produced at a lower cost
-P-A-G-E-53
  ECONOMIC GOODS AND THEIR VALUATION 41 
than was possible in the old regions. The obvious result was 
falling prices and an unprofitable industry in the old cotton 
regions. 
Another illustration, which is of particular interest to-day, 
may be drawn from the Burley tobacco situation in Kentucky. 
Burley tobacco was first grown in Kentucky in the northern 
part of the bluegrass region. This is a rough country where the 
soil soon lost much of its fertility. The industry gradually 
spread southward into the counties of Scott, Bourbon, Franklin, 
Woodford, Fayette, and Jessamine. These counties contain 
the blue limestone region known as the heart of the bluegrass 
country. This is a region of unusual natural fertility. A 
large proportion of this land had remained in bluegrass pastures 
from the first settlement of the country. As the tobacco in- 
dustry commenced to encroach upon this fertile region the 
farmers found it exceedingly profitable to plow up the old pas- 
tures and plant tobacco. Under these conditions the supply 
of tobacco was increased enormously. Prices fell, but the 
farmers in the new regions of production were making large 
profits at prices which meant starvation to the growers of the 
old Burley tobacco centers. The result was the “ night rider ” 
movement in 1908, which was a strike in the dark, figuratively 
as well as literally. The men fighting for higher prices came 
from the regions of high cost of production. They failed to 
understand that the fundamental cause of falling prices was 
the fact that an increase in the supply was being produced at 
a reduced cost. The “ night riders ” forced practically all the 
Burley tobacco growers to omit growing tobacco in 1908 with 
a view to securing a high price for the 1907 tobacco crop then 
in the hands of the farmers. This method of limiting the supply 
was temporarily effective, and prices rose to a level far above 
that necessary to stimulate an adequate supply. The next 
two years brought an unusual expansion of Burley tobacco 
production on the rich lands of central Kentucky followed by a 
decline of this crop on the poorer tobacco lands in the northern 
edges of the tobacco region. Many look upon this episode as 
a victory of the farmers over the tobacco trust, and there were
-P-A-G-E-54
    42 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
unquestionably some bad practices on the part of the tobacco 
buyers which were improved as a result of this experience; but 
it was, fundamentally, a victory of economic forces over the 
inertia of the farmers. The economic fact of lower cost of 
production in a large area capable of supplying the demand 
forced the tobacco growers to transfer their activities from the 
areas of high cost to the areas of low cost. 
We have dwelt at considerable length upon the economic 
forces which determine prices because the relative prices of 
products and their relative costs of production determine what 
the farmer should produce if he would win maximum profits 
as a result of his farming operations. 
The cost of production is determined by a great number of 
things all of which will be taken up as we proceed to study the 
problems of farm organization with a view to securing a maxi- 
mum total margin between cost and price. One thing should 
be remembered, however, that the same general economic 
principles underlie the elements of costs which underlie the 
prices of products. What is to the farmer cost of production 
is to the laborer the price paid for his service. What is cost of 
feed, seed, etc., is also price. What is cost of using land is the 
competitive price paid for the use of the land. Thus it is that 
value is at the bottom of all our considerations in agricultural 
economics, whether viewed from the standpoint of cost or 
price. What we are needing as farmers is to learn how to ad- 
just ourselves to price forces in such a manner as to get the 
greatest satisfaction for the effort put in, consistent with na- 
tional welfare, and when viewed through a series of years.

  CHAPTER V 
THE CHOICE OF CROPS 
Att will agree that in managing a farm one should produce 
the crops which pay best. The difficulty is to know which 
crops actually add the most to the farmer’s profits. A manufac- 
turer may decide upon some one line of production, and devote 
his entire time to the one thing ; but most farmers find it neces- 
sary to produce a number of crops. 
Suppose a farmer found one crop profitable and decided 
to produce nothing else, what difficulties would arise? The 
“risk of depending entirely on one crop, — “ putting one’s eggs 
all in one basket,” — has often been used as an argument against 
the single crop system. This is a point in favor of diversifica- 
tion which should not be lost sight of, but which should be given 
no more than its fair weight in the argument. If the one crop 
requires a very large proportion of one’s time through the 
farming season, it may pay to specialize. If another crop can- 
not be introduced without cutting the area of the special crop, 
the question should be decided on the basis of which system will 
pay best in the long run. In figuring long-time average profits, 
soil depreciation or appreciation should always be considered 
and the element of risk should be covered. 
One of the chief economic reasons for diversified farming is 
to provide profitable employment more nearly throughout 
the year for men and horses. Suppose a farmer should decide 
to produce nothing but Indian corn. The work of preparing 
the seed bed, planting and cultivating the crop, might keep 
him busy for from eight to ten weeks in the spring and early 
summer. The corn laid by, there would be nothing to do until 
corn harvest. The corn harvested, the farmer would have 
43 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
another rest. From the point of view of the employment of 
man and horse labor, other enterprises are needed. Small 
grain, oats or barley, demands the farmer’s energy just when he 
cannot be working on the corn. The oats, barley, or spring 
wheat is seeded very early in the spring, usually beginning 
about a month before the soil and air are warm enough for 
planting corn. The corn is then planted and cultivated several 
times before hay harvest. Not only does the small grain 
supplement the corn in providing employment, but it provides 
the nurse crop for seeding meadows. The harvesting of a 
limited amount of clover hay is supplementary to corn in its 
labor demands in the north central states. The clover harvest 
precedes the oat harvest and laps with the last half of corn 
cultivation, but this lapping may not reduce the amount of 
corn which one man may grow, because -the limit on corn is 
set by the area one can prepare the seed bed for, plant, and 
cultivate the first and second time. After the corn reaches this 
stage, one can care for it and devote from a third to a half of 
his time to other work. 
Corn, oats, and clover may be called supplementary crops, 
because they fit together nicely from the standpoint of demand 
for labor in their production. They are also supplementary 
in their utilization on the dairy farm, silage, clover hay, and 
ground oats making excellent cow feed, and the oat straw is 
needed for bedding. 
Crops which require attention at the same time of year are 
said to be competitive or conflicting crops. Corn, cotton, tobacco, 
sugar beets, and potatoes are examples of competing crops 
which conflict with each other in their demands for the atten- 
tion of the farmer, and it happens that all these are tilled crops, 
and for this reason any one of them may be chosen so far as 
the problem of maintaining tilth is concerned. Other examples 
of competing crops are oats, barley, and spring wheat. These 
crops compete for the farmer’s time and are about equally 
useful as nurse crops for starting meadows, hence the most 
profitable one should be chosen and the others dropped out of 
the field system,

    46 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Should one grow the crop which yields the greatest value per acre? 
Not necessarily, for the crop which sells for the most may have 
cost very much more, and the net proceeds might be relatively 
small. Should one select the crop which yields the maximum 
net profit per acre? There are circumstances where this would 
be a safe rule, but as a general principle this standard fails. 
Crops which require essentially the same amount of labor and 
the same kind of equipment may be compared on this basis. 
For example, oats and barley lend themselves to this basis 
of comparison without great danger of mistakes. In case of 
tobacco and Indian corn this would not, however, be a safe 
basis for comparing relative profitableness for the reason that 
the tobacco requires much more labor per acre than does the 
corn, and one man can grow three or four times as many acres 
of corn as of tobacco. 
Profit per hour of man labor has been suggested as a basis 
of comparison where one crop requires much more labor than 
another. Where the two crops conflict at all stages and require 
the same class of labor, this may serve as a fair basis of com- 
parison ; but where a large amount of labor is demanded on the 
one crop at a time of year when there is no demand for labor 
on the other crop, a serious difficulty in comparing profits is 
introduced. For example, tobacco and corn may conflict 
throughout the growing and harvesting season, but the corn may 
provide more labor in the winter, utilizing the silage in the 
dairy, at a time when no other profitable employment could be 
found. Under these circumstances corn might add more to 
the farmer’s profit than tobacco, even though tobacco yielded 
a higher return per hour on the average than corn. For example, 
assume, that after paying all expenses, excepting for labor, the 
net return left as pay for labor and managerial activity was 
40 cents per hour for labor on corn and its utilization in the 
dairy, and 50 cents per hour for labor on tobacco; but that the 
two crops were competitive during only 60 per cent of the labor 
hours put upon corn and cows. Let us suppose, however, that 
during the remaining 40 per cent of the time the work at which 
the tobacco man could be employed yielded only 15 cents per 
   
-P-A-G-E-59
    THE CHOICE OF CROPS 47 
hour. In this case, for each hundred hours the corn dairyman 
received $40, whereas the tobacco man received $30 plus $6, 
or $36 for tobacco and supplementary work. 
It has been suggested that profit per acre; multiplied by the 
number of acres a man can operate may be a better method of 
comparing the relative profitableness of competing crops than 
profits per hour. This method would seem to possess all the 
merit of the other methods mentioned, but is not without the 
objection that whereas corn, for example, may be put in the 
silo and made the basis of winter employment in the dairy, no 
such farm enterprise rests upon tobacco. Furthermore, to- 
bacco usually conflicts not only with corn but with small grains. 
Tobacco lends itself to a single crop system. For this reason 
it becomes necessary to compare the profits from tobacco plus 
whatever may be combined with this single crop, with corn, 
oats, and hay, plus the live stock industry which is based upon 
these crops. In this case the effect upon the land should be 
carefully considered. 
Where two crops conflict and the increase of the one requires 
the decrease of the other, the various rules may be used to aid 
in passing judgment, but in the final analysis all cases come to 
this: Everything considered, choose from each group of competing 
crops the one which will add most to the farmer’s total net profit, 
and combine as many non-competing crops as will add enough 
to the total profits of the farm to make it worth his time to produce 
this crop rather than use the time for self-improvement or the en- 
joyment of life. 
When this principle of crop selection is followed, i will 
not be true, necessarily, that each crop will be grown where the 
facilities for its production are the greatest; for it may happen, 
for example, that in the region where the facilities for the pro- 
duction of sugar beets are best, tobacco or some other competing 
crop will enable the farmer to win a larger net profit, in which 
case the sugar beet might well be excluded from the system of 
crop rotation in the very region where the natural conditions 
for its production are best. 
It is by knowing relative prices that the farmers, who know
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
roughly relative costs, are able to choose wisely from a given 
group of competing crops. These prices are the resultant of 
the forces lying behind demand and supply. Assuming a 
demand, the supply of a given commodity is influenced by the 
extent of the area available for its production within the terri- 
tory competing on the same markets. In the case of the great 
staples the market is world-wide. Hence a knowledge of the 
agricultural geography of the world is essential to a well-bal- 
anced judgment on the question of probable price relations. 
Let us compare the four competing crops, — cotton, Indian 
corn, sugar beets, and potatoes, — with regard to the extent of 
territory available. The areas available for corn and cotton 
overlap, but the area available for cotton culture is more limited 
than the area available for growing Indian corn. If cotton were 
to be excluded wherever Indian corn can be grown, the cotton 
supply would be very small, whereas corn can be produced in 
enormous quantities outside of the potential cotton regions. 
The result is that the relative prices of cotton and corn tend to 
be such that cotton will pay better than corn on the best cotton 
lands and the extent of the area planted to cotton and the extent 
to which cotton will drive corn out of their common territory 
will depend upon the relative demand for these two products. 
History shows that corn has not found a place on the best 
cotton land of the South as a commercial crop. It may pay 
to grow corn for home use in the cotton belt, and not pay to 
grow it to sell or for commercial hog or cattle production. 
Again, a small amount of corn may be grown on a cotton farm 
without limiting the cotton area which one family can handle. 
This is because a family can grow more cotton than it can pick, 
and a small amount of corn may be supplementary to cotton. 
It is this commercial demand for cotton and the fact that cotton 
conflicts with the commercial growing of all other crops that 
has had much to do in forcing upon the South the one crop 
system with all its disadvantages of probable soil depletion and 
the risk of crop failure of price depression. Whenever cotton 
prices have been low, some planters have given more attention 
to other crops. This has limited the supply of cotton and re-
-P-A-G-E-61
    THE CHOICE OF CROPS. 49 
sulted in higher prices, then cotton has again paid best and 
continued to be king in the South. 
Indian corn and sugar beets have wide areas of common 
territory so far as the physical and biological conditions of 
plant growth are concerned. It happens, however, that sugar 
beets thrive in northwestern Europe and in the western part 
of the United States where climatic conditions do not favor 
the culture of Indian corn. In other words, the area suited to 
Indian corn is much more limited than the area suited to sugar 
beets. The normal economic result is that corn prices are high 
enough to enable this crop to crowd sugar beets out of the sys- 
tem of farming throughout the areas best suited to Indian corn. 
The opportunities for producing sugar beets are so great out- 
side of the corn belt as to yield a supply great enough to keep 
sugar prices too low to enable sugar beets to encroach very far 
over the margin of the potential corn area. 
Potatoes can be grown more widely than corn or sugar beets. 
Potatoes thrive on sandy soils which are less valuable for the 
production of corn and sugar beets. The result is that com- 
mercial potato growing is found most largely on light lands 
outside of the corn belt, although for local consumption they 
are produced throughout the corn belt. 
The general truth is that where two competing crops which are 
in general demand can be grown on the same land, prices will 
tend to be such that the one with the more limited potential area 
will have its choice of territory and its area will expand in the 
direction of the less and less favorable conditions for its produc- 
tion until rising costs and lowering prices, due to increased pro- 
duction, will make it unable to extend farther, owing to greater 
profits secured from the competing crop. As a result of price 
variations, there will ever be more or less uncertainty in the 
zones where the differences in profits are never great. In 
other regions, where the advantage of some one crop is great, 
the system of cropping becomes definitely established. 
Distance from market has long been recognized as an im- 
portant factor in determining what should be produced on a 
given farm. As one rides from a large city into the country, 
E
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
one will usually find the market garden district just beyond the 
outlying plotted area held speculatively for city lots. Next 
beyond this, and often more or less intermingled with the 
gardens area at first, are found farms devoted to the produc- 
tion of city milk, beyond this may be found the butter industry, 
the cheese industry, beef or pork production or grain farming, 
depending upon the location of the city. 
This division of territory among the various types of farming 
or lines of production is the result of relative farm prices of 
the different products. This difference in farm prices is due 
to two factors, namely, the perishability and the quantity pro- 
duced per acre of the products. Perishable products must be 
produced near enough to the market or under such favorable 
conditions of transportation that the commodity can be put 
on the market in good condition. Other things being equal, 
the greater the quantity produced on a given area, the lower 
will be the price per pound, and the closer to the market it 
should be produced. It is usually a combination of these two 
factors that puts market gardens near the markets, and puts 
sheep and wheat farms at a distance from the market. 
Can the farmer work out the most profitable system of crops for 
his farm once for all, so that he need give this matter no further 
attention? Unfortunately the economic problems of farm 
management are never permanently solved. Changes in rela- 
tive prices of competing crops often make it necessary to change 
from the one to the other. This change in relative prices may 
result from the growth of a near-by city, such as to increase the 
demand for bulky and perishable products. The increased 
demand results in increased prices, which enables these crops 
to crowd out their competitors in a larger and larger territory 
surrounding the city. The farmer should, however, be very 
conservative in changing, once he has a profitable system 
established. Changes are expensive. They involve learning 
new things, buying new equipment, and meeting new prob- 
lems of crop conflict, etc. One should not let temporary price 
fluctuations move him to change his plans. But he should 
not be too conservative; if changes in prices result from
-P-A-G-E-63
    THE CHOICE OF CROPS 5r 
permanently changed conditions, the system of farming 
should be quickly adjusted. : 
The change in relative prices may result from a change in 
the number of uses to which a staple crop like cotton or corn is 
put, or it may result from an expansion of the area available for 
the one crop without a like expansion of the area available for 
the other. The expansion of cotton production in Brazil 
or west central Asia or India might reduce the price of cotton 
relatively to that of corn so that corn would replace cotton on 
the margin of the cotton belt of the United States. It will be 
noted that the stability of the system will be greater in the 
heart of the corn belt and in the heart of the cotton belt than 
on the margin between these two regions. 4 
Fluctuations in the rent of land without any change in the 
relative values of the products may necessitate a change in 
crops. Suppose, for example, that the rent of a given piece 
of land is three dollars per acre, and that the net profit per acre 
is five dollars when the land is devoted to corn, and that the 
net profit is twenty dollars per acre when the land is devoted to 
sugar beets; but that the farmer can operate thirty-five acres 
of corn and only seven acres of beets. Then he could win one 
hundred and seventy-five dollars net profit by producing corn, 
and only one hundred and forty dollars by producing beets. 
But, suppose the rent of the land should rise to five dollars per 
acre, without any change in the prices of the products or in the 
costs of production. The profits per acre of corn would then 
be three dollars, and that of an acre of beets would be eighteen 
dollars, so that with the same acreage of these two crops, the 
total net profit which he could win from the production of corn 
would be reduced to one hundred and five dollars, while that 
from the beets would have been reduced to one hundred and 
twenty-six dollars only. In this hypothetical case, the rise in 
the rent would result in a subtraction of only fourteen dollars 
from the total profits of the beet crop, while it would result in a 
reduction of the profits on corn of seventy dollars, so that the 
crop which was the more profitable before the rise in the rent 
would become the less profitable as a result of the rise in rent.
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Changes in farm labor conditions may affect the choice of 
farm enterprises. An unusual demand for laborers in the city, 
or the withdrawal of men from the farm to go into the army, 
may so change the condition in a given community that it 
becomes necessary to select crops which require much less 
labor. This might easily result in a change from an intensive 
crop like tobacco or sugar beets, which require very much 
labor per acre, to a more extensive crop like corn, which re- 
quires much less labor per acre. On the other hand, a farmer 
with a growing family may find it desirable, as his children be- 
come old enough to help, to introduce sugar beets or some other 
intensive crop on his farm in order to give employment to the 
members of his family. 
The amount of available capital may influence the farmer in 
the choice of crops. If he has little capital with which to buy 
dairy cows, he may for this reason produce grain to sell instead 
of producing feed for dairy cows, which might be the more 
profitable if he had the capital with which to go into the 
dairy business. 
The characteristics of the farmer, his likes and dislikes, his 
previous training and special skill in particular lines of produc- 
tion, may very greatly affect his choice of enterprises. That 
which is profitable for one farmer to produce in a given com- 
munity may not be profitable to another because of the fact 
that the second farmer may lack the skill required in carrying out 
that line of production. 
It is a well-recognized fact that the different crops make 
different demands upon the soil. For this reason, the crops 
which are associated together in the systems of rotation should 
be such as will make supplementary demands upon the soil’s 
elements of fertility. This in itself, however, is not a safe 
guide in determining which plants should be introduced into 
the field system; for it might lead to the cultivation of the less 
profitable of two competing crops, and thus reduce the farmer’s 
total net profit. Yet it should ever be kept in mind that if 
one of two competing crops exhausts the soil while the other 
adds to its fertility, this fact must be taken into account when
-P-A-G-E-65
    THE CHOICE OF CROPS 53 
calculating the me¢ profit which these crops can be made to 
yield. The crops being chosen which will, one year with another, 
enable the farmer to win the largest net profit, they should be 
arranged in the field system in such a manner as best to supple- 
ment each other in their demands upon the soil. 
It has been the purpose of this chapter to outline the think- 
ing which the farmer needs to do in order to keep his system of 
cropping adjusted to the conditions of the market in such a 
manner as to yield maximum results. There are other reasons 
for studying market conditions, but this chapter emphasizes 
one most important occasion for keeping posted on market 
prices. Much has been said in recent years about farmers 
controlling their products in order to secure fair prices. With- 
out going into the question of organized control, attention is 
here called to the fact that if every farmer will produce the 
crops which pay best on his farm, this in itself will ‘“‘ cut out the 
losses and let the profits run on,”’ and may be a more feasible 
plan than attempting to have prices artificially raised because 
a given farmer is producing at a loss.
-P-A-G-E-66
  CHAPTER VI 
ECONOMICS OF THE LIVE STOCK INDUSTRY 
THERE are certain crops such as cotton, tobacco, and flax 
which are always intended for the market in their native form; 
there are many other crops, such as the grains and the hay and 
forage crops, which may be sold in their native form or trans- 
formed by the farmer into animal products; and there are 
many other products of the farm, such as soft corn, corn fodder, 
second growth on grain fields and meadows and the grass 
growing on land not suited for tillage or hay crops, which are 
not salable in their original form, but which may be converted 
into valuable products by means of live stock. 
No question arises regarding the utilization of the first and 
the third of these three classes of products, but in case of the 
second class the farmer has ever before him the problem of 
determining whether the largest, long-time average net profit 
can be obtained by selling or by feeding these crops. The 
proper solution of this question is determined by the relative 
prices of the crops and the live stock products. 
One factor ever to be kept in mind in counting the profits of 
the live stock industry is the value, as fertilizer, of the manure, 
which is a very important by-product of this industry. This 
element is usually underestimated in a new country, but in 
the older countries, where commercial fertilizers have long been 
necessary if the farmer would secure the largest net profit in 
the production of field crops, full value must be given to this 
by-product. 
Charles F. Curtiss, of the Iowa Agricultural College, says: 1 
“ Maintenance of fertility is secured by rotation of crops, by 
1¥From a paper entitled “Economic Functions of Live Stock,” read before the 
Economic Section of the A. A. A. S., St. Louis, December, 1903. 
54 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  ECONOMICS OF THE LIVE STOCK INDUSTRY 55 
chemical fertilizers, and by physical and bacteriological methods ; 
but by none of these has the virgin strength of the soil been 
maintained over long periods except as plant production has 
been associated with animal husbandry. By selling dairy 
products in the form of butter and cheese, and restoring the 
by-products by feeding the skim milk, buttermilk, and whey, 
we take from the soil but one-tenth of the fertility lost by a 
grain crop.... If fertilizing material must be bought 
for the farm, it can, under all ordinary conditions, be bought in 
vastly cheaper form as feedstuffs and utilized as such, and the 
residue applied to the soil, than by purchasing fertilizers out- 
right. The very best of fertilizers are often obtained in this 
way without any direct outlay. The use of feedstuffs, rich in 
fertility, may even return a handsome profit as a separate 
proposition, and thus fertilizing constituents come on to the 
farm under most advantageous circumstances. The British and 
other European farmers buy large quantities of our flaxseed 
and corn by-products. They figure that they are the gainers, 
even if they do not make any profit on their feeding operations 
with these products, and they are. Until recently the packing- 
house by-products, including dried blood and tankage in various 
forms, have practically all gone direct to the land as fertilizers. 
To-day these products are serving a most important purpose 
as feedstuffs, and the time is near at hand when practically 
every pound of this material will first be utilized as stock 
food, and later returned to the soil. The returns are so much 
greater and so much more economical in this way as to put 
the purely commercial fertilizer farmer out of business in the 
space of a few years at the outside, where other conditions are 
similar.” 
The feeding of grain, hay, and fodder to live stock is an effec- 
tive means of converting these crops into products of higher 
specific value, which will better stand the costs of transportation 
to distant markets. ‘ Cattle and hogs not only convert, but 
also condense, Indian corn (maize). They enable it to be raised 
profitably in regions too far removed from the markets of the 
country to be transported in that form. By condensing the
-P-A-G-E-68
    56 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
corn to one-fifth or one-sixth of its bulk and weight, and re- 
ducing the cost of transportation in something like a similar 
proportion, the possibility is secured of raising corn in regions 
situated thousands of miles from the market at which the corn 
products, or, what is practically the same, the pork and beef, 
are consumed.” 
Indian corn is largely consumed on the farms where it is 
produced. Four out of five of the corn producers of the United 
States feed their entire crop. From 80 to 82 per cent of the 
corn is consumed on the farms where produced, and much of 
that sold is consumed on other farms. About one-fourth of 
the oats is sold from the farms where grown, and nearly nine- 
tenths of the hay and coarse food is consumed on the farms where 
grown. The percentages of these crops sold varies greatly in 
the different parts of the country. Illinois leads in the sale of 
both oats and corn. The relative importance of Illinois as a 
region from which feedable crops are sold is shown in the Thir- 
teenth Census, Vol. V, map before page 561, which shows the 
receipts from sales of feedable crops in 1909. Twenty-one 
counties in east central Illinois show receipts from feedable 
crops representing 46.7 per cent of the total value of all cereals 
produced. Corn and oats are the principal crops produced 
in this region. There is no other region in the United States 
where feedable crops are so largely sold. In the state of Iowa, 
Illinois’s closest competitor as a corn and oat state, the value of 
feedable crops sold represents 25 per cent of the value of all 
cereals produced. 
There are several reasons for this difference in the type of 
farming in central Illinois and the remainder of the corn-oats 
belt, but distance from the market is certainly a very important 
factor. Chicago is the greatest corn market in the United 
States, and Milwaukee and Peoria rank high among the minor 
markets. 
The following table shows the prominence of Chicago as a 
market for both corn and oats for the year 1914. It will be 
seen that the receipts at Chicago were three and one half times 
that of Omaha, the closest competitor.

Nearly all of the corn and oats shipped into Chicago arrives 
over the railways extending west and southwest from Chicago, 
whereas practically all these grains shipped from Chicago go over 
eastern railways or by lake. This implies that the demand is in 
Chicago and east of Chicago, hence the advantage of this cen- 
tral Illinois area as one in which to grow corn and oats for the 
market. 
So far as the writer has been able to ascertain, the freight 
rate per hundred pounds of hogs in carload lots from the various 
Towa and Illinois railway stations to Chicago is about twice 
that for corn in carload lots from the same stations. It appears, 
also, that the rates for these commodities are, on the average, 
about twice as high from the Iowa as from the Illinois stations. 
On the assumption that the feeding of the corn to hogs and cattle 
condenses the product to one-sixth of its original weight, there 
would be a saving of two-thirds the freight by sending the con- 
densed product. But the saving would be twice as great for 
the Iowa farmers as for the Illinois farmers, and as the price of 
corn rises, the point where it would be more profitable to ship 
than to convert it into live stock products would be reached in 
Illinois before it would be reached in Iowa.

    58 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
In comparing the relative profitableness of crops and live 
stock, especial attention should be given to the alternative 
opportunities for the employment of labor and to the extent 
to which crops and live stock compete with each other in their 
demands for labor. 
The live stock industry comes into competition to some extent 
with the production of field crops. The farmer who feeds and 
properly looks after hogs, cattle, or sheep may not be able to 
spend as much time in the field as he who keeps no stock of 
these kinds. The dairy industry comes more into competition 
with the crops of the fields than do the other live stock indus- 
tries. But while a part of the time devoted to live stock must 
be subtracted from the time which can be spent in the field, yet, 
for the most part, the live stock industry is supplementary, in 
its demands for labor, to the other branches of farming. Live 
stock requires the especial attention of the farmer in the winter 
when nothing can be done in the fields. In the summer, when 
the farmer is busy in the field, much of the live stock is shifting 
for itself in the pasture, and there is usually enough time when 
the ground is too wet for work in the field, to permit the farmer 
to give the needed attention to the live stock which is in the 
pasture. 
To the extent that the live stock industry is supplementary, 
in its demands upon the time and energy of the farmer, to the 
production of farm crops, he has only to decide whether the 
additions to his total net profit resulting from the transforma- 
tion of the various crops into animal products, are sufficient 
to remunerate him for the extra efforts put forth. But to the 
extent that the live stock industry encroaches upon the time and 
energy available for crop production, the problem of determin- 
ing whether to sell his crops or convert them into animal prod- 
ucts presents itself in practically the same form as that of 
selecting crops for the field system. The general principle is 
simple, “Seek the largest, long-time average net profit,” but 
the practical application of this principle is especially difficult, 
because of the limited extent to which these two lines of work 
come into conflict with each other. It can be said, however,
-P-A-G-E-71
  ECONOMICS OF THE LIVE STOCK INDUSTRY 59 
that the live stock industry should enable the farmer to win as 
large a long-time average net profit as he could secure from 
other sources, and enough more to make worth while the extra 
effort put forth when he could have found employment in no 
more productive line of activity, but which time might have 
been spent in enjoying the products of his labor or in improving 
his mind. One thing to consider in this calculation is that the 
crops are usually much larger on stock farms than on grain 
farms of equal natural fertility. 
Whether a given farmer should keep cattle, hogs, or sheep, 
or a combination of these, is determined by the kind of feed at 
his disposal, the relative prices he can secure for the different 
classes of live stock products, and in some measure upon his 
personal likes and dislikes. The corn belt is preéminently the 
hog belt, and the region for finishing beef cattle. The northern 
edge of the corn belt is the principal dairy region, partly be- 
cause of the demands made by cities for whole milk; partly 
because the corn is in danger of being damaged by frost and can 
be more safely handled through the silo. 
In the heart of the corn belt the farmer finds it profitable 
to put a full day in the cornfield. The labor demands made by 
hogs and beef cattle are almost negligible during the time of 
year when corn is demanding attention, whereas the dairy 
makes a heavy drain on the farmer’s time throughout the sum- 
mer, and hence the cow is relatively a stronger competitor 
in the region where corn is a less profitable crop than in the 
heart of the corn belt. 
Cows have replaced sheep in Vermont, New York, north- 
eastern Ohio, and southern Wisconsin. Wool production has 
found its way to the Rocky Mountains. The high specific 
value of wool enables this grazing industry to thrive on rough 
lands at great distances from the market, hence it gives place 
to perishable products or products of lower specific value near 
the markets and on lands suited to field crops. World-wide 
competition has been an important factor in keeping the price 
of wool low, and in discouraging wool production in most parts 
of the United States. During the world war, conditions were 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
60 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
temporarily changed and the high price of wool stimulated the 
sheep industry. 
Horse breeding is an important industry throughout the corn 
belt and the grazing areas of Missouri and Kentucky. Horses 
are required for growing corn, but are required to work hard only 
a few months in the year. By combining horse raising and corn 
growing, the horse labor cost in corn production is greatly re- 
duced. Even in the central Illinois corn area, where hogs and 
cattle have practically disappeared, the rearing of colts is an 
important industry, based in part upon the great amount of 
unsalable roughage available on the corn-oats farm. 
The individuals of any class of live stock are so varied that 
one may have difficulty in deciding which breed or which quality 
to keep. ‘The best are most profitable” is a saying which 
helps little. The problem is to know which will pay best. 
What is best in dairy cows for one locality may not be the best 
in another. The cow which is best for a careful, intelligent 
dairyman may be poorest for a careless, ignorant man who 
keeps cows. This is true primarily because the superior cows 
cost more money, and while they are worth more to the superior 
dairyman, they are worth no more to the man on whose farm 
all stock soon come to look like scrubs. 
Some cattle are excellent for beef production and of little 
use as dairy animals. Other breeds of cattle are efficient pro- 
ducers of milk, but their carcasses have little value as human 
food. Intermediate between these extremes are found a few 
breeds such as the Holstein, the Ayrshire, and the Brown 
Swiss which are excellent dairy animals and produce excellent 
veal calves, while the defective cows yield large quantities of 
fairly good beef. The relative merits of these three classes of 
cattle depend upon the circumstances. On inferior grazing 
lands, where the herd must lead a migratory life during the 
summer, and where labor is dear and land cheap, the special- 
ized beef type usually proves most profitable, but such animals 
are not suited to a city milk district, where the price of the 
carcass of a dairy cow is not to be ignored, but where the pri- 
mary consideration is a large flow of milk of acceptable quality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
ECONOMICS OF THE LIVE STOCK INDUSTRY 61 
The choice between the extreme dairy type and the cow which 
produces both milk and meat should depend upon the price of 
meat. In a country where great quantities of high-class beef 
are produced at low cost, there is more economic reason for the 
highly specialized dairy cow than in a country where beef of 
any kind is high. In other words, the right choice of breeds 
depends upon economic conditions which are ever changing. 
Conditions in America have in the past encouraged highly 
specialized beef cattle and highly specialized dairy cattle. It 
does not follow that this will be true in the future.

CHAPTER VII 
MISCELLANEOUS WORK CORRELATED WITH CROP AND 
LIVE STOCK ENTERPRISES 
THERE are many odd jobs onevery farm which are here classed 
as miscellaneous work because they are not connected directly 
with any of the important crop or live stock enterprises. For 
example, the repairing of old fences, the building of new fences, 
the cutting of weeds along fences and ditches, the filling of 
washes, the repair of buildings, making concrete walks, trim- 
ming trees about the house, making posts, cutting stove wood, 
improving roads about the farm, etc., may be classed as mis- 
cellaneous work. 
This class of work has sometimes been called unproductive. 
This characterization arises out of the fact that even though all 
this work be done perfectly, the farm will yield no income 
without the crop or live stock enterprises. Yet the crop and 
live stock enterprises cannot long be carried on if all this mis- 
cellaneous work is neglected. It is better, therefore, to call this 
labor indirectly productive rather than unproductive. 
One of the most important problems in farm management is 
to keep the indirectly productive labor out of the way of the 
directly productive labor and yet get it done. Just to the 
extent that crop work must be stopped in order to make or 
repair a fence, the possibilities of profits are reduced. The 
purpose of this chapter is to make some suggestions which may 
be helpful in organizing the farm work in a manner that will 
tend to keep the proportion of time on directly productive 
labor at a maximum and arrange to get the miscellaneous work 
done when no directly productive labor can be carried on. 
The experienced farmer usually anticipates his need for fuel 
during seasons when crop work demands his attention, by pro- 
62 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
    MISCELLANEOUS WORK 63 
viding a large pile of wood, ready for the cook stove, before the 
frost is out of the ground in the spring. He likewise anticipates 
his need for fences and utilizes the time after the frost is out of 
the ground until work can commence in the field, building and 
repairing fences. Not only is this time relatively free from 
conflicting enterprises, but there is no other time of year when 
a post can be set with so little labor as in the loose, moist soil 
as it is found just after the frost is out of the ground. The 
shiftless farmer who neglects this opportunity and comes to 
the date when the cattle should be turned into the pasture 
without having the fences in repair may have to take a man 
and team out of the cornfield a day at a time when labor on 
corn is worth 75 cents an hour, to do work which might have 
been done when alternative opportunities would pay no more 
than ro cents an hour. 
Instances might be multiplied without end showing how the 
neglect of miscellaneous work when time is available results in 
great loss to the farmer. To facilitate getting work done at the 
most opportune time the following classifications of work have 
been made: 
(A) (1) Work which must be done at a definite time. 
(2) Work which may be done any time within a wide latitude. 
(3) Work which is often postponed indefinitely. 
(B) (x) Work that can be done when it is raining. 
(2) Work which cannot be done while rain is falling, but can 
be done while the ground is wet. 
(3) Work requiring dry weather and land dry enough to work 
or drive over (hauling manure, lime, etc.). 
(C) (x) Work which cannot be done while ground is frozen. 
(2) Work which can be done while ground is frozen. 
(3) Work which can be done when ground is covered with 
snow. 
A. (rt) Feeding and milking dairy cows, sowing oats, plant- 
ing corn, the cultivation of corn, and the harvesting of the oats, 
are examples of work which will suffer if not done at the right 
time. The farmer who neglects his cows will soon have no 
milking to do. The farmer who delays sowing oats until the  
-P-A-G-E-76
  64. AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
warm, dry days of early summer finds his harvest light, and he 
who delays the cultivation of his corn for one week after it is 
large enough to plow will have a weedy field and a poor crop. 
Success in farming demands that all other classes of work be 
kept out of the way of work which by nature must be done at 
a definite time to secure best results. This class of work is 
often called rush work, not because it should be done poorly, 
but because the profits of the farm depend upon the doing a 
maximum of this work and doing it well. In rush seasons one 
should work the maximum day, expecting to relax when the 
rush is over, but when this class of work demands attention 
one should “ do nothing to-day which can as well be put off until 
to-morrow,” in order to devote a maximum of effort to the rush 
work. 
(2) Work which may be done any time within a wide lati- 
tude requires the very especial attention of the farmer, because 
the time comes when this work cannot be put off longer and it 
may crowd the labor which can be done only at a definite time. 
For example, seed corn may be tested and shelled at any time 
after it is thoroughly cured, but if neglected until the fields are 
ready to plant, this most profitable work of the farm may be 
delayed. It takes a better manager to perform all these tasks 
in seasons when there is no rush work than it does to concentrate 
on rush work, for the season calls the farmer to the task which 
must keep pace with nature, while it is only the power of the 
mind which takes thought of future needs and anticipates these 
wants by making the needed preparation. The rule to follow 
when there is no rush work pressing for immediate attention 
and which must be enforced with methodical and industrious 
habits if the farmer is to rank high as a manager is found in the 
old phrase “ Put off nothing until to-morrow which can be done 
to-day,” in order to be free to devote a maximum of time to the 
rush work when it comes. 
(3) There is much work which should be done in order to 
keep the farm looking tidy and to make life on the farm more 
livable which is often left undone indefinitely. Many a farmer 
has neglected beautifying his lawn because it is not connected
-P-A-G-E-77
  MISCELLANEOUS WORK 65 
in a vital way with the money profits of the farming operations. 
In considering work of this class careful attention should be 
given to the fact that the farm is capable of providing for the 
direct satisfaction of many wants without the intervention of 
money, and that the importance of these wants should be com- 
pared with those to be satisfied by the expenditure of money, 
before deciding to neglect these direct satisfactions to earn 
more cash profits. Many of these wants can be satisfied, how- 
ever, without reducing the cash income, by planning the work 
more carefully. 
B. (1) The second classification is based upon weather and 
soil conditions with respect to humidity. There is a great 
variety of tasks which can be done under shelter and which 
should as nearly as possible be cared for on rainy days. Shell- 
ing seed corn, mending the harness, and repairing tools are 
typical examples. It is necessary to have some device to assist 
one in thinking of these tasks when the rainy day arrives or 
one will let these golden opportunities slip unimproved. The 
writer knows a farmer who keeps a notebook in his pocket in 
which he jots down the tasks which can be performed on a rainy 
day. He calls this his rainy day book. This enables him 
quickly to plan the work for a rainy day when it comes, and to 
choose the tasks with attention to the date prior to which they 
must be performed or come in conflict with rush work. The 
tule is to push rainy day work when it is raining, and to do no 
rainy day work when it is not raining, if there is “ outside ” 
work to be done. 
(2) There is a large class of tasks which may be called “ wet 
land work.” In this class falls the cutting of weeds in the fence 
rows, the repairing of fences, the cleaning up of the wood lot, 
the repair of buildings, the laying of concrete walks, the digging 
of trenches for laying water pipes from the well to the house 
and to the barn, and a score of other tasks which will crowd 
themselves upon the farmer’s mind as he considers the things 
he wants done. The rule is to push the wet land work when 
the land is not dry enough to work and do no work of this class 
when there is field work which can be done. 
F
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
(3) The work which requires dry land and dry weather 
comprehends the greater number of field operations which 
must be performed at a definite time, hence the importance of 
keeping this time free for these activities. The percentage of 
time capable of being used in the field which is actually used 
for this purpose is a measure of one’s ability as a manager. 
C. The third classification is based upon the condition of the 
ground with respect to frost and snow. 
(1) The work which cannot be done while the ground is 
frozen comprehends a large share of the field operations. Some 
of the activities which one is in danger of postponing too long 
and for this reason suffer loss are potato digging, beet lifting, 
and fall plowing. Every farmer should be informed as to the 
time of year the ground usually freezes sufficiently to stop these 
lines of work and bend every effort to having all work of this 
nature out of the way before that date. The fact that the 
permanent freeze is some years much later than the ordinary, 
should not be used as a reason for delay. The good manager 
keeps step with nature, but tries to keep considerably ahead 
of the date when a given task cannot be performed. The early 
dates when the ground has frozen enough to stop plowing 
should be held in mind rather than the later dates. The gen- 
eral rule in autumn is “ work which cannot be done when the 
ground is frozen should take precedence over work which can 
be done later.” Fall plowing should be looked after first and 
corn husking afterwards because the husking can be done when 
the ground is frozen and the plowing cannot. 
(2) In the corn belt, the husking of corn stands out as an 
important task which is performed when the ground is frozen 
but which should be completed before a heavy snow falls. It 
is the fear of snow and severely cold weather that impels the 
corn farmer to bend every energy to clear the field of corn 
before the first of December, or some other date fixed by the 
experience of the community as the time when there is danger 
of weather which will stop the work. 
(3) There are many tasks which can be done in winter and 
while the ground is covered with snow. Examplesare: hauling 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
  MISCELLANEOUS WORK 67 
manure, spreading lime, hauling and preparing stove wood, 
hauling and storing ice, visiting the herds of successful farmers, 
attending the farmers’ course, reading books on the culture of 
crops, on the breeding, care, and feeding of live stock, and on the 
best methods of marketing farm produce. This is the time of 
year for the farmer to work a short day and take time for self- 
improvement. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  CHAPTER VIII 
WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? 
From the standpoint of the farmer, the guiding principle in 
the organization of a farm is to seek the largest net profit; but 
there is another point of view than that of the farmer, and 
that is the point of view of the statesman. Since not only the 
farmer, but every one else, is interested in agriculture, the ques- 
tion arises, are the interests of the country as a whole best 
conserved when each farmer follows tenaciously his own self- 
interest and succeeds in gaining the largest net profits in return 
for the effort which he expends in agricultural production? 
There may be, at certain points, a conflict between the narrower 
and the broader interests. In this case we are confronted with 
the problem of determining whether the individual or the 
general interest should be promoted. To the extent that the 
greatest good to the greatest number demands that the general 
or social interests be served, it falls within the domain of our 
subject to propose laws which will limit the free action of in- 
dividuals in such a manner as to promote the highest interests 
of society as a whole. 
But while human welfare or the greatest good to the greatest 
number has long been recognized as the standard by which 
every law or custom should be accepted or rejected, this prin- 
ciple is so abstract that men may be fully agreed upon its ac- 
ceptance as their scandard, and yet hold exactly opposite 
opinions as to the desirability of a particular measure. The 
statesman needs a more concrete standard which may be used 
with safety in his efforts to set proper limits to the free action 
of farmers and of those with whom they have economic rela- 
tions, in the pursuance of their daily toils. 
Should the maximum in quantity of farm products be the 
goal of the agricultural statesman? The phrase, “ More food 
68
-P-A-G-E-81
    WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? 69 
this year is patriotism ” has at times been interpreted in a way 
which suggests that some leaders in the promotion of agricul- 
ture would make quantity of product the goal in view. If 
quantity of product in pounds or bushels were the goal in pro- 
duction, the agriculture of this country would be very different. 
We would produce more potatoes and other bulky crops, only 
to find the demands of the consumers too small for the supply 
of these articles, and a part of the supply wasted. 
Human desire is the starting point in economic considerations, 
and human welfare is the end in view in economic legislation. 
To the extent that human desires are wholesome, values may 
be made the basis of determining what a nation should produce, 
for human desires reflect themselves in values. The highest 
value of the productions of a country has, therefore, been set forth 
as a practical economic ideal for the statesman. It has been said 
that “the prosperity of a nation is in proportion to the value 
of its productions.” ! This is the economic ideal which was 
set forth by their leaders as the aim and the end of the Patrons 
of Husbandry in their efforts to promote the interests of agri- 
culture. 
To this principle, as an economic ideal, it may be objected 
that legislation may be of such a character as to increase the 
value of the farm products of a country and at the same time 
not improve the economic well-being of the people of the coun- 
try asa whole. It is quite conceivable, for example, that duties 
on imports may be so levied as to increase the total value of the 
farm products of a country without increasing the prosperity 
of the nation. 
It is necessary, in order that this national ideal shall be at- 
tained, that the labor and capital of a country be properly 
distributed among the various lines of economic activity. The 
labor and the capital of a nation should be so distributed among 
the various industries that the portion of these factors which 
is employed under the most unfavorable circumstances shall 
be equally productive, socially considered, in all industries. 
The necessity of this proper adjustment of the productive 
1 See the preamble of the Constitution of the Patrons of Husbandry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  jo AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
forces should ever be kept in mind in the discussion of the 
movements of population from country to city, or vice versa. 
When the productive forces are properly distributed among 
the various lines of production, and where the relative values 
of products are not to be directly affected by public action, it 
would seem that a just and practical ideal to be held in mind 
by the statesman when passing judgment upon what crops 
should be grown, the management of live stock, the intensity 
of culture, the size of farms, and the laws which limit and define 
farmers’ rights in their relations to each other, to their land- 
lords, to laborers which they employ, and to those to whom 
they sell their products, would be the highest long-time average 
value of the farm products of the country as a whole. 
We wish to mark out clearly the distinction between the social 
ideal and the ideal of the individual. The individual seeks the 
largest net profits. He desires to have that share of the product 
which is left to him, after paying what is necessary to engage 
the other factors of production, as large as possible. Where 
the personal interest of the farmer does not extend to all of the 
factors of production, conflicting interests are certain to arise, 
as between the landlord and the tenant, or the employer and 
the employee. While the farmer is interested, personally, in 
having his own share of the produce large in proportion to the 
efforts which he puts forth, the statesman should be interested 
equally in having the returns to all the factors of production 
as large as possible. 
The conflict between the national point of view and that of the 
farm operator may relate to the choice of crops, the intensity of 
culture, the character of the live stock industry, the control of weeds, 
the control of disease, the quality of the products sold, and the 
conservation of the land and the economic and social welfare of 
all classes. When viewed from the national standpoint, it is 
not the return to any one factor in particular, but the sum of 
the returns to all the factors which should be of vital interest 
to thestatesman. With the limitations which have been suggested, 
the highest long-time average value of the total product of the agri- 
cultural industry may be looked upon as the goal, when agriculture
-P-A-G-E-83
    WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? qt 
is viewed from the standpoint of maximum efficiency in produc- 
tion for the nation as a whole. 
But maximum efficiency in production may not be the sole 
aim of a nation. National defense may seem at times to be so 
important as to make it desirable to reduce the efficiency of 
production in order that the nation be self-sufficing to an 
adequate degree. This may be the most profitable thing to 
do with a view to meeting the national needs in times of inter- 
national strife when international commerce is extremely 
hazardous. 
The problem then becomes that of ascertaining to what ex- 
tent a nation should produce everything it needs as nearly as 
possible and to what extent it should produce those articles 
which enable it to secure the maximum free competitive values 
and depend upon international trade to provide the great 
variety of articles which can, in times of peace, be secured 
from abroad more cheaply than they can be produced at home. 
The answer to this question depends upon the national ideal 
and the progress of civilization in the direction of protecting 
international trade. 
To the extent that civilized nations desire to live in peace 
with one another, making mutual concessions from time to time 
and recognizing one another’s rights and the mutual benefits 
to be derived from the exchange of commodities, advantage 
may be taken of the benefits of division of labor among nations 
and the resulting international commerce. On the other hand, 
if strong nations are unwilling to enter this world comity, 
and insist on extreme nationalism and stand ready to encroach 
upon the rights of others upon land and upon sea, it may be- 
come necessary to adopt an economic policy very different from 
the one which would be most productive if a world economy 
were practicable. 
Under the system of extreme national economy, where the 
nation must be self-sufficing in the primary necessities of life, 
industry, and war, many of the advantages of modern civiliza- 
tion may be lost. Luxuries may be secured from abroad in 
times of peace and dispensed with in times of war. A national  
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
system may not only point to the production within the nation 
of the entire supply of the necessities of life and the munitions 
of war, but may result in an agricultural policy which looks to 
the production of a large number of effective soldiers rather than 
@ maximum of agricultural products. In this way the size of 
farms, the tenure of land, and the credit system may all be 
modified with a view to maintaining a very much larger number 
of farm families than would otherwise exist. 
The larger the country and the greater the diversity of soil 
and climate found within her borders, the smaller will be the 
economic loss in adopting a national system of agriculture. 
For this reason the United States would be in a strong position 
compared with other nations under the necessity of a self- 
sufficing national economy. Yet the United States may well 
afford to spend millions annually in maintaining friendly inter- 
national relations rather than undertake to live an isolated 
economic life. 
A study of the exports and the imports of the United States 
will give basis for some conclusions regarding the way in which 
American agriculture would be affected if a complete national 
system were adopted with respect to the production at home 
of all the agricultural products used in our homes and in the 
maintenance of our national life. 
The agricultural imports may be classified as follows on the 
basis of the possibility of producing the supply at home: 
1. Of our agricultural imports some cannot under natural 
conditions be produced in the United States. There is a lack 
of proper soil and climate which makes it physically impossible 
to grow the product without providing artificially the necessary 
conditions. For example, rubber, cocoa, and bananas are 
tropical products which play an important part in our life, 
and which we would probably do without if we could not carry 
on commerce with South and Central America. Coffee may 
belong in this same class, though it has been claimed that 
rather large potential coffee areas exist along our southern 
border. Where these articles are luxuries, we may be better 
off in times of war without them, but where they are important
-P-A-G-E-85
    WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? 73 
in our commerce and industry, as for example the raw material 
for making binder twine, the probability of having the supply 
cut off in times of war should be carefully considered, and, if 
the case be serious enough to justify the action, the production 
of substitutes should be stimulated, or great quantities held in 
storage with which to meet emergencies. 
2. Other agricultural products which are now largely im- 
ported could be produced in the United States in great abun- 
dance, but the natural conditions for their production are rela- 
tively less favorable than in foreign countries. Hemp, jute, 
and lemons may be given as examples. If world peace can be 
assured as a condition of a world economy, articles of this class 
may well be brought from abroad ; but if peace is very uncertain, 
the necessities in this class may better be produced at home at 
a greater cost. 
3. Some of our agricultural imports could be produced in 
the United States in quantities sufficient to take the place of 
the imported supply, and the natural conditions are as favorable 
for their growth in this country as in foreign countries, and yet 
it is profitable in times of world peace to import them from 
abroad rather than produce the whole supply at home. This 
may be true (a) because the land which is well suited for the 
production of a given imported crop can be used more profitably 
in the production of some other crop which does not thrive in 
the foreign country from which we import. (6) Again, this 
may be true because labor and capital are more abundant and 
wages and interest are lower in the foreign competing country. 
The sugar beet may be taken as an example of a crop which 
thrives as well in parts of the United States as in Europe and 
which cannot be produced with profit in the United States 
without a bounty or a protective tariff. Both of the above 
conditions are operative in making beets unprofitable in parts 
of the United States. There are large areas with suitable soil 
and climate for the production of beets where corn or tobacco 
are competing crops. These crops do not compete in the beet 
regions of northwestern Europe. Hence, under free competitive 
conditions, it pays better to import sugar. than to produce it  
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
in the corn belt of the United States. Outside of the corn belt, 
especially in California, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho, the question 
is less a matter of competing crops than it is a matter of high 
cost of labor, yet in these regions beets compete with potatoes 
and alfalfa. Raw silk and tea are good examples of crops which 
are practically excluded from being produced in the United 
States because of the wide difference in the cost of labor in the 
United States and in eastern Asia. The first of these reasons 
for finding it more profitable to buy than to produce is a perma- 
nent one. It is based upon natural forces. The second is 
based partly upon differences in the density of the population 
in different parts of the earth, and, hence, being a social condi- 
tion is subject to change. 
4. Some articles can be produced profitably in limited quan- 
tities but not in sufficient abundance to satisfy the demand of 
the nation because of the limited areas on which they prove to 
be the strongest competitors for land, labor, and equipment. 
Wool is an example. Wool is the most profitable product 
which can be produced in some of the high, dry areas of the 
Rocky Mountain region, and in some other regions where rough 
grazing lands are abundant and where the dairy cow is not a 
strong competitor. Sheep may also find a profitable place in 
small numbers on the general farm, but so long as cheap wool 
may be secured from South America and Australia, it may be 
that the greater part of the supply can be imported more cheaply 
than produced at home. This has proved true even when a 
protective tariff favored the home grower of wool. 
5. Some articles can be produced profitably in certain qualities, 
but not in all qualities desired by the people of the United States. 
Cotton, for example, is imported, not because we do not produce 
as much cotton as we consume, but because it is possible to get 
a very special variety of cotton from Egypt. Tobacco is another 
example. We export much tobacco, but, in order to meet the 
demand for certain qualities, tobacco is imported from Cuba and 
Sumatra. 
When all these conditions which give rise to commerce are 
considered, it becomes obvious that with a given outlay of

    WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? 75 
labor and capital the wants of the people can be more com- 
pletely satisfied by producing the things which pay best and 
buying from abroad the articles which cannot be produced or 
which it is less profitable to produce in this country. 
The economic policy which should be followed by a nation 
will depend largely upon the prospects for world peace and the 
safety of international trade. Were world peace assured, a 
world economy would be desirable, but at the present time the 
student is constrained to give due attention to the importance 
of the all-round development of agriculture with a view to being 
able to feed and clothe the people with a minimum of com- 
merce in times when all international law is swept aside. 
The opinion one will hold regarding free trade and protection 
depends in part upon one’s judgment with regard to future 
peace. If we must become self-sufficing as a nation, protectio1 
is one means of inducing farmers and manufacturers to produc 
commodities which they would otherwise find unprofital 
The national policy should be the one which will yield the maxi 
well-being for the people of the nation through a long se 
generations. In view of the long periods of peace whi 
world has enjoyed, particularly since the days of Nap 
and in view of the present hope for the beginning of a n&® 
of peaceful international relations, it would not seem w2” 
look to a continuous self-sufficing policy in order to be re 
for war emergencies, but to be prepared for rapid readjust 
in agriculture if a period of unsettled international relatiol 
should again overtake us. Sir James Caird advocated the fr 
importation of wheat into England on the theory that since at 
that time wheat growing was less profitable to the nation than 
grazing, it would be better to produce cattle during times of 
peace and buy wheat with the expectation that if war condi- 
tions should cut off the foreign supply the pastures could be 
plowed up, put into wheat, and made to produce more for the 
emergency than if wheat had been grown continuously. This 
is exactly what England did, and during the World War the 
wisdom of Caird’s advice was demonstrated. 
Grain and cotton stand out as our great agricultural exports.

   76 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Sugar, molasses, and sirup together take the lead in value of 
agricultural imports. Coffee is next in importance. Fruits 
are both exported and imported in large quantities. This is 
due to the fact that the United States produces a surplus of 
certain kinds of fruits, namely, dried apples, prunes, raisins, 
apricots, and peaches, which are exported, whereas we produce, 
for example, less than we consume of bananas, lemons, and 
pineapples. 
To become a self-sufficing nation we would have to reduce 
our grain crops and our cotton crops and produce more cane 
and beets for sugar and molasses, and either reduce our coffee 
consumption or learn to grow great quantities in the potential 
coffee regions of the United States. Our area is broad and in- 
cludes a very great variety of soils and climate, and yet there 
would be undoubtedly a much smaller amount of agricultural 
products available for consumption in this country under a 
self-sufficing economy than under a world-wide commercial 
economy. 
The experimental and educational method of stimulating the 
introduction of new crops has proved important in this country. 
For many years the Secretary of Agriculture made large ex- 
penditures to stimulate the beet sugar industry in the United 
States. There were those who pointed out that the high cost 
abor put this country at a distinct disadvantage over the 
t sugar producers of northwestern Europe. Others pointed 
t that in the corn belt, in particular, the beet would be unable 
‘0 compete with corn for the reason that the area on the surface 
of the earth capable of corn production is very small compared 
with the area capable of beet production, and for this reason 
the relative prices of corn and sugar on the world market will 
tend to be such as will enable corn to drive sugar out under 
conditions of open competition, and that there are other crops 
which we can grow which will add more to the well-being of 
the people. These views seemed justified and were true under 
the assumption of world peace. But, as a matter of fact, the 
stimulus resulting from government activity established a beet 
sugar industry which was tottering to a fall under free trade,

  WHAT SHOULD THE NATION PRODUCE? q7 
but which has come forward with great energy to meet the 
emergencies incident to war. In the light of recent events and 
taking into account the entire cost of stimulating this industry 
in time of peace, has the fostering of the beet sugar industry 
been justified? The same question arises with respect to wool 
and other farm products. The experimental method may be 
better than the bounty or tariff for stimulating industries which 
will succeed on a small scale. This is true of most farm crops, 
but it is perhaps not true of most manufactures. 
There are many conditions under which it is desirable to 
stimulate the production of articles which the farmers have 
not on their own account found occasion to produce. The 
absence of production may be due to lack of knowledge of the 
profits, lack of skill in the new line of production, or it may be 
due to the fact that the crop is temporarily less profitable than 
some competing crop, but in the long run would be more profit- 
able. Where a crop is less profitable than another, and this 
is due to permanent physical conditions, only the necessity for 
a self-sufficing national policy will justify stimulating the farmer 
to produce the crop. But where the conditions which make the 
crop unprofitable are temporary, social conditions which may 
be changed, such as sparse population, lack of knowledge or 
skill, the case is a very different one. It may pay to stimulate 
immigration and education, and give bounties or tariff protec- 
tion which will make it profitable for farmers to take up the new 
lines of production. 
In general, any industry which can be established in a few 
years, and which when once established will be able to stand 
on its own merits without government stimulus, should be 
stimulated during the period of its introduction. During the 
infancy of the new crop or agricultural industry, the labor and 
capital expended may add less to the national dividend than 
some old crop or industry, but this loss is only apparent, and 
is really chargeable to the capital account of the country if when 
established the new crop pays better than the one it displaces. 
To summarize, each nation should produce those agricultural 
products which in the long run will add most to the well-being
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of the people. So far as feasible, the products should be those 
which will make the agricultural productions reach the maximum 
long-time average value under conditions of free competition among 
producers and among consumers throughout the civilized world. 
In estimating the long-time average values of products, weight 
should be given, however, to the chance of war, if they must 
be secured from abroad. Furthermore, in figuring the maximum 
average value, where there are temporary conditions which re- 
tard the development of an industry, the principal weight should 
be given to the future. 
In addition to the economic and political conditions which 
have been considered above, there are ethical questions which 
should not be lost sight of by the statesman in settling the 
question of what the farmers of a nation should produce. Many 
statesmen will feel that the desires of men should be curbed in 
the interest of human welfare. This may lead them to study 
physiological and ethical principles with a view to eliminating 
certain crops or products made from farm crops which are 
injurious to mankind.

  CHAPTER Ix 
LAND AS A BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 
Lanp, labor, and equipment are the agencies of production. 
Without land there is no production of economic goods by the 
farmer, the manufacturer, or the merchant. The term “ land ” 
is here used in the broad sense to include all natural agents. 
When a man buys land he acquires the use of the air, the sun- 
shine, the rainfall, the wind blow, and in the United States, 
unless especially specified to the contrary, he acquires all 
minerals lying beneath the surface. 
While all classes of economic activity require land, agri- 
culture makes the greatest demands for this agent of produc- 
tion. The census of manufacturers fails to record the area used 
by the manufacturers, but gives especial attention to the statis- 
tics of labor, material, and machinery used in the manufactur- 
ing enterprises. In the agricultural census the subject of the 
land area used is given a prominent position, and it is shown 
that in r910 there were 878,798,325 acres of land in farms in 
the United States. 
The economic uses of land have been classified as (1) affording 
standing room, (2) supplying mineral products, and (3) provid- 
ing the conditions and materials of plant growth. Manufac- 
turers use land for standing room and make heavy demands for 
the products of the mines. Commerce makes heavy demands 
for land to be used for transportation purposes and the loca- 
tion of warehouses, but agriculture makes use of the soil in 
the growing of plants which are the means of satisfying human 
wants. 
Farm land varies greatly in its economic capacity. The 
capacity of a given area of land is measured in terms of the number 
of units of labor and capital which can be associated with it with 
optimum results at a given stage of industrial progress. The 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
capacity of land is influenced by its topography, temperature, 
rainfall, texture, and the kind of crops grown. Clay loam 
usually has greater capacity than sandy loam, that is, a greater 
amount of labor and capital must be put upon a given area in 
order to secure optimum results in a given line of production. 
In other words, land with high capacity permits of a higher 
degree of intensity of culture in a given year in the production 
of a given crop than land with a low capacity. This will be 
further explained in a later chapter. 
Land varies not only in its economic capacity but also in its 
economic efficiency. The economic efficiency of land is measured 
in terms of the value of the product per unit of labor and capital 
expended upon it. The term “ efficiency ” is here used in the 
same sense as it is used by the engineer who calculates the effi- 
ciency of his locomotive in terms of the power developed per 
unit of coal shoveled into the fire-box, the only difference being 
that here we are calculating the number of dollars’ worth of 
product per dollar’s worth of labor and capital put into the 
land. More briefly stated, efficiency is measured in terms of 
output per unit of “input,” whereas capacity is measured in 
terms of input per acre of land. 
Capacity and efficiency are the two dimensions of productivity. 
If one would compare the productivity of two pieces of land 
it is not enough to know how much corn or other crop it will 
yield per acre; it is necessary to know the expense of the pro- 
duction (the input) and the product per unit of expense. A 
piece of land might yield a large product per acre and yet class 
as relatively poor land because of the great expense of produc- 
tion. 
The product is always equal to capacity multiplied by efficiency, 
and in order to compare the worth of two grades of land one 
should ascertain the number of capacity units per acre and the 
efficiency per unit of capacity. For example, in comparing 
land “A” and land “B” let us assume that land “ A” has 
io units of capacity and “B” 8 units of capacity. If their 
efficiency were the same the ratio of usefulness would be as 
to is to 8. But each capacity unit, that is each dollar expended
-P-A-G-E-93
    LAND AS A BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 81 
on “A” land yields $1.60, whereas each dollar expended upon 
“B” yields only $1.50. The productivity of “A” is, there- 
fore, $1.60 X 10, or 16, while the productivity of “ B ” is $1.50 X8, 
or 12. Thus while the capacity ratio of “A” and “B” is 
5 to 4, the efficiency ratio is 16 to 15 and the productivity ratio 
is 4 to 3. How much more can a given farmer afford to pay 
per acre for “ A ” land than for “ B ” land? 
Productivity of land may be thought of in terms of pounds 
or bushels of product per acre, physical productivity; or pro- 
ductivity may be thought of in terms of the value of the prod- 
uct per acre, economic productivity. Land varies greatly in 
physical productivity due to differences in its physical and 
chemical properties, and it varies greatly in its economic pro- 
ductivity because of differences in the value of the product per 
unit in different localities as well as in the kinds and quantities 
of products on different pieces of land. 
Under the physical conditions which are conducive to plant 
growth are included: (1) the moisture and (2) the tempera- 
ture of the soil and the air, (3) topography, and (4) the mechan- 
ical structure of the soil. The amount of rainfall and sunshine 
remaining the same, the moisture and the temperature of the 
soil, and its capacity for retaining the chemical elements of 
fertility vary greatly from place to place because of differences 
in the size of the particles of the soil. By cultivation the soil 
may be improved to some extent, in this respect. By drainage 
and by irrigation the moisture of the soil can be modified, and 
by the use of glass and artificial heat the temperature of both 
the soil and the atmosphere can be regulated. But in most 
places and for most purposes Nature has done infinitely more 
for man than he can do for himself in providing the land with 
these desirable physical qualities. 
From the standpoint of the economist the most important 
chemical conditions of plant growth are: (1) nitrogen, (2) phos- 
phoric acid, (3) potash, and (4) water. Other chemical com- 
pounds contribute to plant growth, but these four are the 
ones which require special attention because they are present 
in the soil in limited and varying quantities, and because they

are more or less readily exhausted and require considerable 
effort to increase or replenish their supply. In the humid 
regions where the water needed by plants is abundantly sup- 
plied by nature this element of fertility requires little or no 
attention, but in the arid regions water ranks first in economic 
importance. The carbon dioxide gas of the air is as important 
to plant growth as is water, but it is present in such great 
abundance that it has no value placed upon it and hence does 
not enter into the list of economic conditions which require 
our attention. 
In comparing the value of two pieces of land physical pro- 
ductivity is not a safe basis for the reason that the physical 
product of two pieces of land may be the same but the values 
of the products may be very different, due to differences in the 
cost of marketing the products. 
When a man contemplates the purchase of a farm, he wants 
extent of land with even topography and he wants this land 
to be fertile, but what is sometimes even more significant than 
these qualities is the location of the farm which he is to cultivate. 
In fact the physical and chemical characteristics of the land are 
greatly influenced by its location. Heat and moisture, and the 
character of the rocks from which the soil is formed vary greatly 
from place to place. But besides these variations in the natural 
conditions, there are variations in the social conditions which 
influence the production and sale of products. Large popula- 
tions are in some places concentrated on small areas, leaving 
vast territories sparsely settled. This variation in the density 
of population may be explained, in part at least, in terms of 
variation in the physical environment, but our especial interest 
is in the effect and not the cause of this variation in the density 
of population. The farmer who is near a great center of 
population, such as London or New York, can sell his products 
for the same price which is paid for like products which have 
been shipped great distances. Thus it is that of two pieces 
of land possessing the same physical productivity, or fertility, 
the farmer prefers the one located nearer a great ce.1ter of popu- 
lation, because of the greater “farm value ” of the products.
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Because of these variations with respect to fertility and 
location, land is said to vary in economic productivity, or, in its 
value-producing power. Variation in physical productivity of 
land is due to variation in soil, variation in rainfall, and varia- 
tion in temperature. The soil in the United States varies from 
the sterile, arid sands of the great American desert to the well- 
watered fertile loams of central Illinois, from land that will 
yield nothing to land which will yield enormous crops of corn 
year after year. 
The improved land of the United States is shown in the 
accompanying map which is based upon the “ improved land 
in farms.” In r1g10 there were 478,451,750 acres of improved 
land in the United States. The enumerators were instructed 
to include under improved land, “all land regularly tilled or 
mowed, land pastured and cropped in rotation, land lying 
fallow, land in gardens, orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and land 
occupied by buildings.” The improved land is not evenly 
distributed over the United States. For example 82.9 per 
cent of the total area of Iowa, 78.2 per cent of Illinois, 33.7 
per cent of Wisconsin, and 1.8 per cent of New Mexico is im- 
proved farm land. Only 25.1 per cent of the total area of the 
United States is given as improved farm land, whereas 73.2 
per cent of England is improved farm land. The relatively 
low percentage of improved land in the United States and the 
uneven distribution of this land can be explained largely in 
terms of topography, soil, and climate. A map showing the 
topography of the United States helps one to understand the 
low percentage of improved farm land in the large are as occupied 
by mountains. (See Fig. 3.) A map showing the rainfall helps 
one to understand why vast areas are eliminated from this class 
of plowed or mowed land, there not being enough rainfall to 
support tilled crops. (See Fig. 4.) The soil map shows the 
great irregularity of the soils of the United States with regard 
to their usefulness. A map showing the mean temperature 
during the growing season also throws light on the distribution 
of improved land. The resultant of all these forces is given in

United Statesin 1909. (See Fig. 5.) The variation in value of 
crops is due, of course, not only to differences in topography, soil, 
and climate, but to differences in the character of the people cultivat- 
ing the land and to differences in the distances from the market. 
While only 25.1 per cent of the total land area of the United 
States is improved farm land, 46.2 per cent of the total area is 
in farms. Thus 21.1 per cent represents unimproved land in 
farms. This is not to be ignored when considering the land 
basis of agriculture. Much of this unimproved land provides 
valuable pasture. It is never plowed or mowed, because it is 
too wet, too hilly, or contains too many obstructions such as 
stones and stumps. In five counties in southern Wisconsin 
for which pasture statistics are available, 78.5 per cent of the 
unimproved land in farms is reported as used for pasture, about 
3 of which was designated woodland pasture. A large share of 
the woodland on farms yields considerable pasture. This same 
area yields wood for fuel, fencing and buildings, also wood prod- 
ucts for the market, such as posts, lumber, and cord wood, 
which supplement the farmer’s income. On one farm in 
central Wisconsin, which is more than half woodland and on 
which the tillage area is gradually encroaching on the timbered 
area, about one-fifth of the total farm receipts comes from the 
sale of wood in various forms. 
The vast areas of land not in farms in the United States is 
mainly occupied by mountains, deserts, forests, cities, railways, 
etc. A part of it is used as range pasture, but much of it serves 
no agricultural purpose. Some of it can be converted into farms, 
but the greater part of it is at present far below the margin of 
profitable utilization. 
Irrigation is proving an important means of extending agri- 
culture in the arid regions. To quote Professor Elwood Mead: 
“The uninhabited and mismanaged areas of the arid region are 
full of opportunities. A realization of the possibilities of this 
region and of what man can accomplish by a right use of its 
resources has been of slow growth. To the early fur traders 
and explorers the arid region was a dreary, worthless waste.

crossed its vast expanse to reach the golden rivers of California 
was there given any prophetic vision of the magic to be wrought 
by irrigation. Nor is this surprising. It is difficult to imagine 
anything less attractive than the stretches of barren sand broken 
only by the isolated yuccas of the Mojave Desert, or anything 
more dreary than the crucifixion thorn of Arizona. Only in 
localities where the work of the reclamation has been in prog- 
ress long enough to permit the growth of trees, flowers, and 
shrubs, can the possibilities of the soil and climate be appre- 
ciated. No greater contrast can be found anywhere than is 
afforded by a comparison of the desert above the ditches and 
the cultivated fields below them. ... The arid West is the 
nation’s farm. It contains all that is left of the public domain, 
and is the chief hope of those who dream of enjoying landed 
independence, but who have little beside industry and self- 
denial with which to secure it. As it is now, this land has little 
value. This is not because the land lacks fertility, but because 
it lacks moisture. Where rivers have been turned from their 
courses, the products which have resulted equal in excellence 
and amount those of the most favored district of ample rain- 
fall.” And yet, with respect to the proportion of these arid 
regions which may be made productive, the same authority 
gives the following rather discouraging estimate: “if every 
drop of water which falls on the mountain summits could be 
utilized, it is not likely that more than ten per cent of the total 
area of the arid West could be irrigated, and it is certain that, 
because of physical obstacles, it will never be possible to get 
water to even this small percentage.” 
The clearing of cut-over land. There are vast areas of land 
in the United States formerly in forest from which the saw 
timber has been cut, much of which may be converted into farm 
land. This land usually requires a very considerable amount of 
labor supplies and equipment to clear it of stumps and brush. 
This accounts for the fact that it has been passed by so long 
as rich prairie lands were available. Unfortunately, however, 
much of this cut-over land both in the North and in the South

is of poor quality for farming purposes because of the excess 
of sand in the soil. By careful selection very important quanti- 
ties of good land can be added to our farm area at an expense 
which will prove a profitable investment. 
Drainage is another important means of expanding the area 
of improved farm land. Along the rivers and coasts and in 
much of the glaciated area of the United States marshes and 
swamps are found which when drained will add greatly to the 
supply of farm land. It has been estimated that 70,000,000 
acres of land await improvement by drainage. 
The introduction of new varieties of grains and forage crops 
which are suited to semiarid regions makes possible the exten- 
sion of agriculture where the rainfall is too light for the crops 
which are commonly grown in the humid regions. For example, 
the drought-resisting macaroni wheats have recently been in- 
troduced with great profit. ‘In many places west of the rooth 
meridian, where wheat growing with other varieties is prac- 
tically impossible on account of drought, the eastern Russian 
varieties by virtue of their extreme drought-resisting qualities 
will produce, ordinarily, a crop of from twelve to twenty bushels 
per acre. By the use of these wheats, therefore, these locali- 
ties may become important additions to the wheat area.” 1 
The introduction of several varieties of sorghum as forage 
crops in the southwest is resulting in the expansion of farm land 
in western Kansas and parts of Texas and New Mexico. 
Along with the introduction of new crops which can be grown 
on semiarid lands, much is being done to expand the area of 
plow land by new methods of culture commonly known as 
“ dry-farming,”’ which consists in cultivating the land to con- 
serve the moisture. It is common to cultivate the land for one 
season with nothing growing on it in order to conserve the 
moisture and then seed to wheat. By this means the wheat 
crop may have the benefit of more moisture than would 
be available if attempts were made to secure a crop each 
year.

     LAND AS A BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 91 
The future will be very different from the past with regard 
to the expansion of the area of farmland. In 1850 the land area 
of the country was 1,884,375,680 acres, but only 15.6 per cent 
of it was in farms, only 6 per cent was improved farm land, and 
there were only 1,449,073 farms. In 1gr1o the total land area 
of the country was 1,903,289,600 acres, 42.6 per cent of which 
was in farms, 25.1 per cent of which was improved land, and 
there were 6,361,502 farms. The best farm land of the United 
States was brought into cultivation during the sixty years 
from 1850 to 1910. Prairie land and the development of the 
railway system made this the period of the most rapid develop- 
ment of farms in the history of this country. A study of the 
soil, climate, and topography convinces one that the expansion 
of the agricultural area will proceed much slower in the future 
than it has in the past. In fact the decade from 1900 to 1910 
showed a great decline in the rate of expansion. Between 
1890 and 1900 the farm area expanded more than 215,000,000 
acres, while between 1900 and 1910 the farm area expanded only 
about 40,000,000 acres, though the increase in population was 
greater in the latter decade than in the former. 
Quality of the new land. During the past sixty years, when 
the area of farm land was increased, it was not unusual for the 
new land to be more easily brought under cultivation and more 
fertile than the land already under cultivation. 
This was true during the period of the development of the 
prairies of the north central states and the black prairie of 
Texas. In the future, however, when the demands for agricul- 
tural products make it desirable to resort to lands not now used 
for agricultural purposes, the new additions to the supply will 
either be expensive to bring under cultivation or infertile when 
brought into use. This means that the new increments of supply 
will yield less per dollar of expenditure upon them and can for 
this reason be resorted to with profit only under condition of rising 
prices for farm products or falling costs for labor and equipment. 
The growth of our population is sure to make increasing 
demands upon the agricultural resources of the country, a part 
of which may be met by extending the industry into regions 
    
-P-A-G-E-104
     
    ga AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
which are not being used; but the most important means of 
increasing the supply of agricultural products in the future 
will be doubtless by farming more intensively the land which is 
already in use. This means that the part which labor, equip- 
ment, and skill in management will play in agricultural produc- 
tion will be more important, relatively, in the future than in 
the past. In other words, there will probably be a continual 
increase in the amount of labor and capital it will pay to expend 
on a given area of land with a view to increasing the product. 
This will make the problem of the proper degree of intensity of 
culture a central one in the minds of the thinking farmers. 
While the product can be greatly increased by means of 
increased intensity of culture, it is true that after a certain 
point has been reached the return per unit of expense declines 
with every increase in intensity. Thus whether the new in- 
crements of supply of farm products are secured by expanding 
the farm area or by increasing the product per acre, the law of 
increasing costs and diminishing returns per unit of social economic 
energy put into agricultural production is almost sure to operate. 
The hope for relief from the depressing effect of the law of diminish- 
ing returns lies in the improvements in men and equipment which 
will increase their efficiency.

  CHAPTER X 
FARM EQUIPMENT 
By the term “‘ equipment ” we mean all produced instruments 
of production. In this class fall all agencies of production ex- 
cepting man and land or nature. Thus horses, tools, machinery, 
buildings, fences, seeds, feeds, and other supplies are here classed 
as equipment. Economists have used the term “ capital ” 
in the same sense the term “ equipment ” is used here. The 
term which clearly refers to the concrete goods rather than to 
their value or to the amount of money invested in them is 
preferred because a large share of the readers of this book are 
accustomed to thinking of “ capital” as the amount of money 
invested in the land and the equipment together. 
The equipments of the farm may be classed as movable and 
immovable. In the first class fall the live stock, tools, machin- 
ery, and supplies, while buildings, fences, wells, etc. form the 
latter class. A distinction is sometimes made between operat- 
ing capital and fixed capital; the former is applied to those items 
which we call movable equipment, the latter including land as 
well as permanent improvements. It is only fair to note, how- 
ever, in this connection, that a dairy cow barn and silos are just 
as truly operating capital in the milk business as the cows them- 
selves, and a tobacco curing shed is operating capital to the 
tobacco grower as much as his transplanter, but in the common 
usage of the terms, the barns, silos, and shed would be classed 
as fixed capital. 
Farm buildings in the United States were valued at $6,- 
325,451,528, April 15, 1910, or about 15 per cent of the valua- 
tion of all farm property. Implements and machinery were 
valued at $1,265,149,783, and live stock at $4,925,173,610. 
93  
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The average value of farm buildings was $7.20 per acre, that of 
implements and machinery $1.44, and that of live stock $5.60 
per acre, a total of $14.24 per acre for these equipments. The 
feeds, seeds, and other supplies on hand were not given, but 
the equipments given represent 30.5 per cent of the total in- 
vestment shown in the census, and it is believed that when 
supplies are added for April 15, the equipment will equal at 
least one-third the total farm investment of the country. 
The average value of each class of farm property per acre 
of land in farms is shown in the following table:

From this table it will be seen that buildings and machinery 
are very much more important in the North than in the South, 
and in the East than in the West. These differences are due 
to differences in climate, type of farming, and the standard 
of living of those who live on farms. While the above table 
is useful in making comparisons with respect to the amount 
invested per acre in the different parts of the United States, 
the following table, showing the percentage distribution of 
value of farm property, is more useful in comparing the relative 
importance of each class of investments.

During the second half of the 19th century, northern agricul- 
ture was revolutionized by the application to agriculture of a 
great variety of labor-saving machinery. The sickle, the cradle, 
and the scythe were replaced by the reaping and mowing ma- 
chines which did the work of many men. The reaper first 
simply cut the grain and left it to be bound by hand, but before 
the end of the eighties the self-binder was the common method 
of harvesting small grain of all kinds where grown in commercial 
quantities. 
The methods of threshing small grain made great progress 
during the past century. Threshing with the flail, and tramp- 
ing out by means of horses or cattle, were being replaced by 
simple forms of threshing machines in 1840. The early thresh- 
ing machine consisted of a cylinder and a concave each studded 
with spikes. This machine was driven by horse power. This 
machine knocked the grain loose but did not separate it from 
the straw and chaff. The winnowing was usually done by 
means of the fanning mill turned by hand, though many farms 
in the West had no fanning mill. The thresher and fanning mill 
were soon combined in the one machine which threshed and 
cleaned the grain,
-P-A-G-E-108
  96 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Aside from these inventions which center about the small 
grain, the most important inventions were the steel plow, 
the corn planter, the corn cultivator, the mower, the rake, and 
the horse’ hay fork. These inventions eliminated a great share 
of the labor involved in growing the staple crops of the 
North. By the use of machinery the effectiveness of human 
labor in the production of northern field crops was more than 
doubled. 
This development of machinery seems to have been the result 
of a scarcity of labor at a time when railway transportation made 
the fertile prairies of the north central states accessible to the 
eastern markets, making commercial grain growing profitable. 
The invention of machinery has reduced the part played by 
human brawn and increased the part played by human brain, 
and by mechanical and animal equipment. The main tendency 
has been to increase the amount of land one man can operate. 
What the effect will be when population increases more rapidly 
than the land, and the desire is to get larger amounts of product 
per acre instead of farming more acres, is a question worthy of 
attention. Every effort has been devoted to increasing the 
capacity of machinery with respect to land and the efficiency of 
machinery with respect to man. The future need will be in the 
direction of greater efficiency of machinery, when measured in 
terms of product per unit of land. 
The invention of the cotton gin in the previous century 
stamped upon the South a type of farming making large demands 
for hand labor in the field in hoeing and picking cotton. Little 
progress has been made in the use of labor-saving devices for 
the picking of cotton and the husking of corn. 
The improvements in the live stock have been in the direc- 
tion of greater productivity. The tendency has been to secure 
a hog which can be prepared for the market in from 6 to 9 
months instead of from 12 to 15 months. The tendency has 
been to develop a cow which will yield a large amount of butter 
fat without careful records to show whether this is the result 
of large product per unit of feed or simply large product without 
regard to feed consumed. With high feed costs more atten-
-P-A-G-E-109
    FARM EQUIPMENT 97 
tion must be given to the efficiency of cows if the farmer would 
secure high profits. 
Throughout the past century the presence of cheap grazing 
lands resulted in the most careless use of land and feed in the 
beef cattle industry, but the recent movement has been the 
same as that in hog production. The beef animals are being pro- 
duced in a shorter period which usually means greater effi- 
ciency in terms of land and feed. The baby-beef industry is 
the result of this movement for reducing the length of time re- 
quired to produce a steer. This usually means more intensive 
culture and probably small gross returns per hour of human 
effort put into the business, but it provides labor for many more 
hours in the year and greatly increases the returns per unit of 
land. 
Equipments of all kinds vary in capacity and efficiency. 
This is true of horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs. In each class 
there is a variation in the amount of feed and labor demanded 
by the different animals, or their capacity; there is also a 
wide range in the product per unit of input, that is in their 
efficiency. There has been a tendency for experimental feeders 
to confuse digestive efficiency and economic efficiency. This 
has led some people to believe that all differences in dairy 
cows, for example, are differences in capacity. The table on 
the following page based upon the results of the Wisconsin dairy 
cow competition, 1909-1911, throws light upon the question of 
differences in the economic efficiency of dairy cows. 
It is believed that this table helps to establish the idea that 
being a “ good feeder,” however desirable this quality in a 
cow, is not the only qualification of a dairy cow. In the above 
table the cow which ranked second in the amount of feed con- 
sumed ranked twenty-fifth in product per unit of feed. 
The range in efficiency of the 26 cows in the herd from which 
these figures were taken was from 1.44 to 2.46. When all of. 
the 398 cows in the competition are compared the variation is 
much greater, varying from .92 to 2.71. It should be recognized, 
however, that when cows on different farms are compared, the 
differences may be due in part to differences in the efficiency 
H
-P-A-G-E-110

  of the men in charge of the cows, and only partly to differences 
in the potential efficiency of the cows themselves.

FARM EQUIPMENT 99 
There is a wide range in the efficiency and the capacity of 
the different machines intended for essentially the same pur- 
pose, as for example plows, harrows, mowers, hay rakes, hay 
loaders, reapers, threshers, and silage cutters. 
These differences exist at a given time because one kind of 
machine is suited to one condition with respect to climate and 
topography while another machine suits best under other con- 
ditions. The fact is, however, that improvements made by 
one company of manufacture is soon duplicated by another, 
so that the machines on the market, available for a given type 
of farming, vary but little after the principle has once been 
thoroughly worked out. Mowing machines and self-binders, 
for example, vary but little in construction aside from speed of 
the sickle and length of the cutter bar, which differences enable 
the farmer to choose to suit his condition. 
The range in the efficiency and capacity of machines is best 
emphasized when the subject is viewed historically. Studies 
made by the United States Department of Labor show that by 
the methods used in 1829-1830 one hundred hours of labor 
would produce about 46.5 bushels of barley, whereas in 1895- 
1896 one hundred hours of man labor results in over 1100 bushels. 
While all of this change cannot necessarily be attributed to the 
improvement of machinery it is certainly true that the effi- 
ciency of machinery as measured in terms of product per unit 
of human labor was enormously increased as a result of the 
new forms of machinery introduced during this period. 
In the production of wheat each day’s labor produced 34 
bushels in 1829-1830, while under the machine method of 1896 
the product had expanded to 60 bushels per day of human labor. 
In general the increase in product per unit of man labor has 
varied from 150 per cent in the case of rye to 2244 per cent in 
the case of barley. 
Some of the machines which have so greatly increased the 
product per man in agricultural production are too expensive 
to be owned by the small farmer. The threshing machine, the 
ensilage cutter, and the corn sheller are typical examples. In- 
stead of increasing the size of the farm beyond the point of 
LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
economy when other forms of equipment are concerned or 
reducing the machine to an inefficient size in order to make the 
machine fit the farm, the practical solution has been to have 
one farmer own a machine with which he does the work for a 
whole neighborhood. For six weeks in the fall the dairy farmer 
of southern Wisconsin works in codperation with his neighbors 
threshing grain and filling silos. 
For some farms the self-binder is a burden because it is kept 
a year for two days’ work. Where there is but little machine 
work to do the economy of making one binder do the work on 
several farms is obvious. 
The tractor is the most expensive piece of farm machinery 
which the farmer has contemplated buying for his own use. 
It would appear that some plan whereby the plowing of a neigh- 
borhood might be done by one tractor would be more in keep- 
ing with good farm economy than to put a tractor on each farm 
where it will stand in the shed most of the time. Furthermore, 
before buying an expensive machine, like a tractor, the farmer 
should consider very carefully the annual cost of its use including 
interest, depreciation, repairs, and supplies. This should be 
balanced over against the reduction of other costs and the in- 
creased income. The danger is that the farmer will underesti- 
mate the cost of using a tractor and overestimate the amount it 
will reduce other costs, such as horse labor costs and human 
labor costs. The fact that machinery has done so much for the 
farmer in the past leaves him open to exploitation, and the 
danger is that the agricultural papers will join hands with the 
manufacturers in carrying on this exploitation. 
Equipments are very different from land with regard to the 
possibility of increasing the supply. The increase in the supply 
of animal equipment is limited only by scarcity of land on which 
to produce herds. The supply of tools and machinery may also 
be increased indefinitely, the limit being set only by the amount 
which the farmers can use with profit on the available land 
area. In general, it may be said that the equipments may be 
expected to increase more rapidly than the land supply. 
The contrast between land and equipments is greatest, how- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  FARM EQUIPMENT Ior 
ever, when the qualities of the new increments of supply are 
considered. Whereas the new increments of supply of land are 
expected to be less and less useful as time passes, not only are 
the new increments of supply of equipments expected to be more 
useful than the old supply, but the old supply may be replaced 
by improved varieties. This is especially easy in the case of 
machinery where a new design unrelated to those formerly in 
use may entirely replace the old. With live stock, limitations 
are set by the fact that the new is the progeny of the old and 
possesses essentially the same characteristics. The oppor- 
tunity for quick improvement here comes from the multiply- 
ing of the animals of superior quality and eliminating those of 
inferior quality. 
In general, the possibility of continuous improvement of the 
usefulness of farm equipments makes the outlook for the future 
optimistic in spite of the fact that the new additions to the farm 
land area may be less and less useful.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 
W8ILE it is the purpose of agricultural production to satisfy 
human wants, and man is rightly considered the end in view 
in the production of all economic goods, it is also true that 
human brawn and human brain are so important in giving direc- 
tion to the other factors that man may easily be counted the 
most important of the three factors of production. Whatever 
affects man as an agent in agricultural production seriously 
affects the results of this basic industry. 
There is essentially but one class of people engaged in agri- 
culture in the northern part of the United States, but in the 
South there are clearly defined lines of demarcation between 
managers and workmen. In the North the same man is usually 
a manager and a workman. Those who are workmen and not 
managers are usually young men who expect to become farmers 
on their own account in the course of time. The difference 
in the South is due to the presence of the colored workmen who 
labor under the direction of white managers. In many foreign 
countries there is a classification of the agricultural popula- 
tion into landlords, farmers or managers, and laborers. This 
is notably true of England. While one man may represent all 
of these classes in the United States, there are functions corre- 
sponding to the three classes. Especial attention will here be 
given to labor and management as functions of the human 
factor in agricultural production. 
In 1910 there were about twelve and one-half million persons 
engaged in agricultural pursuits in the United States. About 
half of these were classed as farmers, and the other half were 
classed as laborers. Five-sixths of the total were male and one- 
sixth female, but of the laborers, three-fourths were male and 
102 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  
THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 103 
one-fourth female. Over three-fifths of the laborers are members 
of the farmers’ families, and less than two-fifths are “ working 
out.” 
The human element in agriculture is, as a rule, organized 
into family groups. Where the natural family is too small for 
the farm, additional members are taken into the family as wage 
earners. Where the families are too large for the farm, some 
of the members work for other families. While this is the rule, 
there are numerous exceptions. It is by no means uncommon 
to find a cottage on the farm where a married laborer lives and 
works for the farmer. 
The family organization lends much to the permanency, 
the physical and mental character, and to the means of control 
of labor in agriculture. 
The functions of man in agriculture may be divided into 
management and labor. There is no clear-cut division between 
the managers and the laborers on most farms in the United 
States. The organization is usually more or less democratic. 
The farmer or manager participates in the labor of the farm, 
and the other workers usually feel free to make suggestions 
regarding the management. 
The managerial functions may be divided into two classes: 
First, the function of determining general policies. For ex- 
ample, the choice of a farm with respect to location and size, 
or the choice of types of farming with respect to crops to grow 
and live stock to keep, are questions which require careful 
deliberation. Second, the function of immediate supervision 
of the work. The projecting of the program of the day, and 
the meeting of emergencies as they arise require alertness of 
mind if the labor is to be directed with best results. Since 
every farmer must perform both of these functions, it is evident 
that farming is a business requiring men of many qualities. 
Farmers vary greatly in their ability as managers and as 
workmen. This isa matter of common observation. J. E. T. 
Rogers! says, “‘ Just as one field may grow more corn than 
another field, without putting the farmer to any greater cost in

cultivating it, — just as a shop in one street may be more suit- 
able for business than an equally good shop in another street, — 
just as one mine may yield more coal or iron than another mine, 
while the cost of working both is the same, and so on witha 
variety of other such naturally useful objects, —so one man 
may, with no greater cost of preparation than his neighbor, 
earn a great deal more than that neighbor. There is a superior 
fertility of certain fields, a greater profit to be got in certain 
places, richer veins in certain mines, and similarly there is a 
greater natural power in certain minds. Two lawyers may have 
the same education and be equally diligent, but one may earn 
hundreds where another only earns tens. Two physicians 
may have had the same advantages of study, and have equally 
striven to profit by their opportunities, and one may make a 
fortune while the other can barely earn a living. 
“Now in the case of the field, the shop, and the mine, it is 
easy to measure the natural advantage which the more favored 
possess over theless. . . . It is not so easy, however, to meas- 
ure the advantage which superior abilities give some persons 
over others who work in the same calling ; but they are none the 
less real and solid.” 
There are, likewise, differences in men’s bodies. These differ- 
ences are easily recognized, but before giving further attention 
to the significance of these differences, an attempt will be made 
to outline the qualities of men which are essential to success. 
Health and strength are essential qualities of the farmer. 
There are tasks on the farm which require skill rather than 
muscle, yet when the workman on the farm is followed from 
task to task and from day to day there is a great deal of work 
found which requires plain muscular strength, tasks in the 
performance of which the strong man may move with ease, 
whereas the weakling will wrestle without results. Two 
weak-muscled men are often required to do the work of one 
strong man, and it often happens that a fine team of horses 
stands entirely too long, awaiting the loading of the wagon, 
simply because adequate human brawn is lacking. The man 
with ill health, who is often unable to work, has little hope for
-P-A-G-E-118
    106 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
success on the farm. The tasks of the farm must be done 
at the right time. The farmer cannot drop out for a day or 
a week and come back and pick up the work where he left off. 
There is no place for the weakling on the farm. 
Skill in the variety of tasks of the farm is essential if one is to 
earn anything farming. The man without skill often earns 
less than nothing for the reason that he is associated with land 
and equipments which possess potential powers of production 
which may not be realized upon if not properly handled. For 
example, four horses and a gang plow cost about 50 cents an 
hour and should plow about half an acre per hour. If an un- 
skilled plowman fails to plow more than one-third of an acre 
in an hour, the loss in the utilization of horse labor is enough to 
hire a skilled plowman. In feeding a calf, the unskilled feeder 
endangers the life of the calf twice a day and often occasions 
losses much greater than the amounts required to hire a skilled 
calf feeder. 
No premium is usually paid for ordinary skill in farming over 
what the unskilled worker gets in other lines, for the reason 
that farmers of ordinary skill are abundant, and there is no 
alternative use for such skill. More people are trained in 
agriculture than are needed for the farms. What is not scarce 
has no value, and yet the young man without farm rearing who 
undertakes farming has before him the problem of acquiring 
skill at a time in life when it is expensive to acquire. No 
time is lost when a small boy picks up one by one the “ tricks 
of the trade” and the skill of hand needed on the farm, but if a 
grown person has this skill to acquire he should not hope to se- 
cure very high wages while he is acquiring it. In fact, the farmer 
can scarcely afford to take a man without farm experience 
without charging him for the privilege of acquiring skill. It 
usually happens, however, that there are unskilled tasks about 
the farm at which the workman can earn something, although 
at the more important tasks he may be earning nothing or even 
losing money for the farmer. 
The workman should be capable of making suggestions which 
may improve the quality of the work he is doing. Ingenuity 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 107 
in improvising means of accomplishing the task assigned him is 
usually desirable if not associated with a stubborn disposition 
which makes the workman unhappy if he cannot have the priv- 
ilege of making changes in methods without the approval of 
the manager. It is a fine quality to be able to suggest changes 
without any insistence that they be introduced contrary to the 
judgment of the employer. 
The work habit is essential to a satisfactory workman. One 
who is industrious by habit enjoys his work and would rather 
work than be idle; putting forth his muscular energy is a joy 
to him. This is markedly in contrast to the lazy person for 
whom every action requires will-power to overcome the pain of 
exertion. It is the latter class who are always pulling back, 
setting a slow pace for the crew, and stirring up discontent. 
There is no place on a good farm for a man who does not enjoy 
work. 
A clear vision of what is to be done is essential to both the 
functions, — management and labor. Ability to arrange the 
work in such a manner as to get a maximum of result with a 
given outlay is essential to good management. A clear mental 
picture of the work to be done, and how it may best be done 
makes farm management an easy task. Without this vision 
a manager is a blind leader. 
Good judgment in deciding what to do at a given time and what 
to leave undone requires both knowledge of farming as well as 
experience in farming. Every workman must take a share of 
the responsibility for the successful operation of the farm; 
hence it is important that every man on the farm possess good 
judgment. Judgment is required in tightening a nut on a plow 
bolt, for if left loose it will come off, and if turned too tight it 
may break and delay the work. Judgment is required in feed- 
ing and in watering a horse, to say nothing of the judgment 
required in fitting a collar to a horse in such a manner as to 
keep the shoulders sound and in good working order. Then, 
again, judgment is required in setting and holding a plow or a 
cultivator, and in a thousand and one other things which arise 
in succession from day to day through the year. 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Knowledge is essential to good judgment. Knowledge of 
crops, live stock, and machinery is essential to intelligent man- 
agement. This knowledge should include the needs of the 
various crops and live stock, and the results which may normally 
be expected in terms of the physical productivity of each. This 
is not all that is needed, however. In order to decide intelli- 
gently on what to produce, it is necessary to know the prices 
which may be secured for each product of the farm and the 
price which must be paid for the use of land, labor, and equip- 
ments. The former knowledge comprises the physics, chemistry, 
and biology of farm management; the latter is the center of 
the economics of farm management. It is only the active- 
minded man who continually looks for new information who 
will keep informed in all these branches of knowledge which 
form the basis of rational farm management. 
Ability to give and to receive directions and explanations relating 
to the work is very important. The tasks of the farm are 
spread over so much territory that each workman is largely 
self-directive in the carrying out of the work of the farm. The 
ability to hold conditions in mind in giving instructions, and 
to hold instructions in mind when carrying out the work is 
very important to the success of the operation. A workman 
should require to be told but once the depth the ground is to 
be plowed in a given field for a given purpose, the course to 
take in harrowing the plowed field the first time after plowing, 
the policy of the manager with regard to deep and shallow 
cultivation of corn, the system of feeding the horses and each 
other variety of live stock, the approved method of milking 
cows, and many other details. A man who forgets what he is 
told and does as he likes may prove an unsatisfactory workman, 
and certainly will unless he is very wise in directing his energies 
in the interest of the proprietor. 
Self-control is one of the very important qualifications of the 
farm manager. He who cannot control himself will have little 
success in controlling others. Self-control is also essential to 
rational decision on crops to grow and live stock to keep. The 
man who lets his likes and dislikes take precedence over facts
-P-A-G-E-121
THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 109 
and figures will certainly fall short of the possible results. One 
who follows his own taste, regardless of economic results, may 
temporarily get more personal satisfaction, but will make a less 
productive use of the land. From the national point of view, 
such a one is an undesirable kind of farmer in this one respect 
at least, and in the long run will be eliminated by competitive 
forces. The high-type farmer coolly acts in conformity with 
economic forces, regarding it as his duty to himself, his family, 
and his country to make the right use of the agencies of production 
and to deal honestly and fairly with all men. It is not always 
easy to be fair-minded in a transaction with a rascal, but even 
here the emotions should not lead a man to lose control of him- 
self and let the spirit of revenge have supremacy over rational 
judgment. Self-control is essential to the mastery of economic 
forces. 
Ability to hold one’s mind on one’s work is essential to doing 
the work well. The good workman who enjoys his work has 
no trouble on this score, but the lazy timeserver usually allows 
his mind to wander and his tongue to clatter, which insure in- 
efficiency of the employee and his associates, whereas the man 
with his mind on his work adjusts his operations to changed 
conditions when needed and is in a position to improve methods. 
There is no place on the farm for the former, but the latter 
makes farming a joy to himself and his associates. 
Ability to work to schedule is sometimes called the “ time 
sense.” Even among men with the work habit who enjoy 
their work, some know how to keep pace with time and turn off 
the work, while some do not. Men with the “ time sense ” 
will start the milking at the same time each day and finish the 
task without a variation of more than two or three per cent 
in the amount of time required. In plowing a field the man with 
the time sense turns off a day’s work each day. He knows 
how many furrows he must plow in order to accomplish the 
amount he deems a day’s work. He knows how much he must 
do each hour, and as the railway engineer watches his schedule, 
so does the good workman sense the pace required to accom- 
plish a day’s work. This is not so simple a task for the farmer 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    IIo AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
as for the locomotive engineer, because varied work and tem- 
perature, the air movement, the dryness of the soil, and the 
character of the previous crops all affect the speed which is 
correct for a given day. The schedule must be figured for each 
combination of circumstances which presents itself. The 
farm workman who has the time sense and for this reason works 
to schedule will earn from $5 to $10 per month more for this 
reason. Much of the occasion for long hours on the farm can 
be removed by introducing system and snap into the work. 
Ability to control men is essential in the farmer who is an 
employer of help. This requires the ability to understand the 
temperament of men and to treat them in such a way as to bring 
out the action desired with good feeling on the part of every one. 
Fairness in the treatment of men is essential to this result. 
The manager who feels like criticizing the workman for accom- 
plishing so little should assume in his questions that an adequate 
cause prevented the man from accomplishing more. In case 
of uncertainty as to how much should be accomplished, the 
manager should put his hand to the task. This will often make 
him well pleased with what others have accomplished. The 
manager who criticizes his workmen on the basis of things he has 
imagined to be true without making sure of the facts will lose 
the confidence, good will, and respect of the men under him, 
without which control is impossible. 
Control is usually easier where workmen are young. Boys 
who have been used to parental guidance conform more readily 
to directions than older men who have been used to greater 
freedom of action. The fact that about half of the workers 
on farms in the United States, other than the farmers themselves, 
are members of the family of the farmer, greatly facilitates 
control of the workers on farms. This not only gives a paternal 
basis for control, but is supplemented by the worker’s interest 
in the estate as one who may expect to share in the inheritance. 
This is one reason why the family farm is usually more success- 
ful than the farm operated by hired men. 
Ability to coéperate with neighbors is important, especially at 
threshing time and when the silos are to be filled. Good   
  
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 111 
relations with one’s neighbors depends more upon little things 
than upon important matters. The cats, the dogs, the pigeons, 
or the pet rabbits are more likely to cause trouble than the 
horses or the cows. The laws and customs regulating the 
farmer’s rights and privileges with regard to these larger animals 
are well established, whereas in the case of these smaller animals 
property rights and restrictions on the freedom of these animals 
are not so well established. Generosity in these matters is 
essential to good relations with one’s neighbors. It pays to 
humor one’s neighbors in all small matters. This done, the 
larger relations are likely to be easily adjusted. 
Faithfulness to the interests of the farm is a quality which 
makes the workman invaluable if he possesses the other neces- 
sary qualifications. This requires that the workman put the 
success of the farm, that is the doing of his work well and at the 
right time, above his own personal desire for comfort and enter- 
tainment. Hired managers are sometimes valueless, and often 
worth much less than nothing. Unless the leader is faithful, 
little can be expected of the other men. It sometimes happens 
that farmers do not take their own farm work seriously. Such’ 
farmers never command the respect of good workmen. 
Interest in one’s work is essential to faithfulness, and makes it 
easy. The time killer, the slipshod workman, the man of un- 
even and uncertain pace, the man of irregular habits regarding 
his eating, sleeping, and social activities, the man who likes to 
sit down but hates to get up; the man who continually uses 
intoxicating liquor; or the man without hard muscles and a 
clear mind has a difficult task before him even if he has a desire 
to do the square thing, and tries to be faithful to the interests 
of the farm. 
One should carry out faithfully the plan which has been de- 
liberately decided upon. For example, there may be differ- 
ences of opinion as to whether the corn should be checked or 
drilled. The workman may desire to drill the corn, but the 
manager may decide, after considering all the arguments for 
and against drilling, to have the corn checked, especially be- 
cause he fears the field cannot be kept clear of weeds unless it  
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
can be plowed both ways. Faithfulness demands that the work- 
man forget the contention, and put forth all his skill and energy 
in checking the corn so that it can be cultivated in both direc- 
tions with ease. Workmen have been known who, under these 
, circumstances, deliberately ran the check wire too loose or too 
tight or allowed the wire to creep across the field by drawing more 
from one end than from the other, and in various ways botched 
the job so that the corn could not easily be cultivated cross- 
wise, and hence nothing was gained by checking instead of 
drilling. Such action is proof that the workman is incapable 
of faithful service, and hence unworthy of his position. 
Honesty is a prime requisite. The man who says he doesn’t 
know, or who avoids telling his employer something which he 
knows and which the employer has a right to know, is dis- 
honest. The man who breaks a tool and lays the parts together 
and assumes to know nothing about the accident is at heart a 
liar. There is no place on the farm for the liar, because he can 
never be trusted. The only safe and sane way is for the work- 
man to report his mistakes and his accidents. A mistake re- 
ported may be adjusted and forgotten, but a hidden mistake 
grows into a larger difficulty, endangers mutual distrust, and 
ultimately the discharge of the employee. The only profitable 
way is for both parties to be honest where there is clearly 
something which ought to be said. Frankness may go too far, 
however. Too great freedom in saying what one thinks may 
lead to hasty and ill-advised statements. Only after careful 
consideration should criticisms be made, but when made they 
should always be presented directly to the one criticized and 
not to others. 
Courage is a quality which adds greatly to the effectiveness 
of a man in any line of work. It is important, however, to dis- 
criminate between courage and conceit. Courage is defined by 
Webster as: “ That quality of mind which enables one to en- 
counter danger and difficulties with firmness, or without fear or 
fainting of heart.”” One who is conceited, according to the same 
authority, entertains a “ flattering opinion of one’s self.”” Con- 
ceit greatly reduces the value of a man to the farm. The con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 113 | 
ceited man makes mistakes which are expensive and unneces- 
sary. Conceit sometimes makes a man seem courageous who 
is really not courageous but foolhardy. True courage pre- 
supposes a correct estimate of one’s own ability, knowledge of 
the difficult task to be performed, good judgment in under- 7 
taking or refusing to undertake the work, and resoluteness in 
executing the task if undertaken. Courage greatly increases 
the usefulness of a man on a farm. 
Patience is another quality which adds to the value of the 
worker ona farm. A great variety of live stock must be trained 
to do what is wanted, and made to do the thing while yet un- 
trained. The man who loses patience loses power. The man 
who keeps patient conserves his energies, and that of the animals 
with which he is working. The love for farm animals makes it 
easy to be patient in handling them. 
These physical, intellectual, and moral qualities are possessed 
by farmers in widely different degrees of perfection. These 
differences in the abilities of men account largely for the dif- 
ferences in the profits secured by different farmers and in the 
wages secured by different workmen. A satisfactory choice of 
workmen on the part of employers, or a wise choice of employer 
on the part of workmen requires ability to judge the qualities 
of men. 
It makes a difference which laborer is employed. Owing to 
the fact that men and equipment, as well as land, vary in 
their economic productivity, the total produce will be influenced 
by the way in which the grades of the different factors are as- 
sociated for productive activity. The way in which this com- 
bination should be made is the subject of a later chapter.’ 
The supply of the human factor. The human factor in pro- 
duction is less under direct economic control with regard to the 
rate of increase of supply or the quality of the new increments of 
supply than are farm equipments. Malthus’ theory of popula- 
tion emphasized that population tends to be as great as the pro- 
ductive energy of the country will permit. In the form in which 
Malthus first stated the theory, the idea was emphasized that 
the pressure of population upon the food supply would ever be 
I    
-P-A-G-E-126
  II4 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
such as to cause a great deal of misery. He later recognized 
various checks on population other than poverty, and it is now 
recognized that the standard of living desired by a people will 
determine how much the population will increase as a result of a 
given increase in the production of economic goods. Further- 
more, the Darwinian idea of evolution through the struggle for 
existence and the survival of the fittest when viewed in the 
light of our present knowledge of the variations in the economic 
productivity of men leads to the view that it is those who are 
less capable as producers who are in danger of not being able 
to make a living in normal times. This means that there is a 
process of natural selection going on which tends to eliminate 
the less efficient, and thus lift the average of human efficiency. 
The ultimate good resulting from this evolution should not lead 
to ignoring the suffering of these who are on the lower margin. 
Society should care for them in a humane way which will not 
encourage their reproduction. 
Whatever else may be true, the population of the United 
States has increased more rapidly than has the land basis of 
agriculture, and it is a matter of common belief that such 
an increase will continue, and that workers in agriculture will 
probably increase more rapidly than the land basis. 
It has been seen that the new increments of land will probably 
be less and less desirable as more and more must be brought 
under cultivation to supply the needs of man. It has been 
noted that farm equipments may ever be replaced by those of 
the better quality. The quality of the new increments of supply 
of farm workers may be improving from generation to genera- 
tion not because of control, as is true of farm! equipment, but 
because of the existence and improvement of our educational 
systems. It would seem at times that the inefficient have 
large families and the efficient small families, and that this 
militates against progress in the average intelligence of the 
farming population. It is often said, also, that education is a 
stepping stone from the farm and tends to sort out the best 
and take them from the country. These are the pessimistic 
points of view. The few data available tend to show that the
-P-A-G-E-127
    THE HUMAN BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 115 
educated farmers are more efficient than the uneducated farmers 
in competition with them. One who is optimistic by nature 
will believe in the possibility of and actual progress in the in- 
creased economic efficiency of people who do the farm work of 
this country. But if a person is by nature pessimistic, he may 
magnify the possibilities of decline in the qualities of men due 
to the fact that the whole population gradually gives place to 
the younger generation. The hope is in the educational effort 
which teaches the younger generations what the older genera- 
tions learned from experience and experiment, and thus makes 
the wisdom of the race cumulative. 
When the three factors of production are compared, it will be 
noted that they are alike in that the individual units vary in eco- 
nomic productivity ; they are unlike with respect to the rate at which 
they are increasing in quantity and with respect to the quality 
of the new increments of supply. If one assumes no change in 
men and equipments and a tendency to increased population 
not limited by present or higher standards of living, it is logical 
to take a pessimistic view of the future of mankind; but if one 
believes that the improvements in the qualities of men and 
equipment will offset the declining productivity of the succeed- 
ing new increments of land, and if one believes in the power of 
education to advance the standard of living, it is easier to be 
hopeful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  CHAPTER XII 
THE CHOICE AND THE COMBINATION OF THE GRADES OF 
THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 
Ir has been noted that all the factors of production have 
this common characteristic that they vary in their capacity 
and in their efficiency. Much has been heard in recent years 
about efficiency and the efficiency movement in the industries. 
About twenty years ago, at a time when some men occupying 
prominent positions in the field of economics were emphasizing 
the resemblances of the instruments of production, with a view 
to formulating simple and comprehensive principles, Professor 
Ely was saying to his students: “ Give careful attention to the 
differences in the economic characteristics of the instruments of 
production. In these differences we may find some of the 
most significant conditions of our economic life.” The facts 
and theories which are presented in this chapter are the result 
of taking this advice. 
Capacity has been defined as power to receive, absorb, take 
into, or associate with. The word capacity has in recent years 
been popularly used to indicate the output of a mill or factory. 
In this book the original, and still the dictionary, meaning of 
the word “ capacity” will be adhered to. In this sense ca- 
pacity refers to “input,” not to output. It has been recog- 
nized since the days of Ricardo that land varies with respect to 
the amount of labor and capital which can be invested per acre 
with optimum results, that is, land varies in capacity. Cows 
vary greatly in the amount of feed which they can consume 
with optimum results when fed with the same care and by the 
same man, hence cows vary in capacity. The same thing is 
found true of every specific class of instruments of production 
from milk pails to threshing machines. Variation in capacity 
116 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 117 
exists likewise in the human factor. There is a very wide range 
of differences in men with respect to the amounts of land, labor, 
and capital they can operate. High capacity is not always a 
desirable quality. For example, certain land requires much 
more power to plow and more work with the pulverizer and 
harrow to put it in condition for planting seeds, yet does not 
produce extra large crops per acre. The labor of milking some 
cows is twice as great as that required in milking others, and 
they do not necessarily produce any more milk. Capacity, 
or the power to absorb the other factors, implies nothing as to 
usefulness of a factor in cases of this kind unless taken in con- 
junction with efficiency. 
Efficiency is defined as a ratio between the energy put in 
and the results secured. The efficiency of a factor of produc- 
tion is measured in terms of the value of the product per unit 
of the other factors (of given grades of efficiency) when as- 
sociated in the most profitable proportions. To illustrate, 
two pieces of land may yield widely different results per hour 
of man and horse labor expended upon them by the same man. 
Two cows may vary widely in the amount of butter fat they 
yield per pound of feed consumed when the two cows are fed 
by the same man upon the same feeds. 
The relation of capacity, efficiency, and productivity are 
easily understood. The productivity of a physical unit of an 
instrument of production, as an acre of land or a cow, is the 
resultant of capacity and efficiency. The product divided by 
the capacity equals the efficiency. In other words, capacity 
relates to “input ”’; efficiency to “ output ” per unit of “ in- 
put ”’; and productivity relates to the total product per acre 
of land, per cow, or per man. The calculation of efficiency 
may be made in terms of physical product or in terms of the 
value of the product. In analyzing the productivity of cows 
and other movable instruments of production, physical produc- 
tivity is often the better basis of comparison because of differ- 
ences in values at different locations. In the case of immovable 
instruments of production the value of the product is the more 
satisfactory basis of comparison.
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
To illustrate the sense in which the term capacity is here used, 
assume that a given farmer, with a given outfit of horses, tools, 
and other equipment, can operate 80 acres of “A” grade land 
or 100 acres of “B” grade land, farming either piece to the 
proper degree of intensity of culture. This implies that “A” 
grade land has greater capacity for absorbing labor and equip- 
ment than “B” grade land. Each acre of the “A” grade 
land requires 14 per cent of the labor and equipment in question 
while each acre of ‘‘ B ” land absorbs only 1 per cent, which 
means that the capacity of ““A” grade land is one-fourth or 
25 per cent greater than that of “ B ” grade land. 
To illustrate the idea of efficiency, assume that a given farmer 
with a given outlay for labor and equipment can secure a prod- 
uct worth $1800 on “ A ” grade land and a product worth $1600 
on “B” grade land. Under these conditions the “ A ” grade 
land would be said to have a higher degree of efficiency than the 
“B” grade land. The difference in efficiency would be meas- 
ured in terms of the difference in the product per unit of outlay. 
One hundred per cent of outlay yields $1800 in one case and 
$1600 in the other; $1800 is 12} per cent greater than $1600, 
hence “A” grade land may be said to be 124 per cent more 
efficient than ‘B” grade land. For further illustration see 
the problems at the end of this chapter. 
One should not be confused by the fact that a given factor 
may have high capacity or efficiency in terms of one other factor 
and low capacity or efficiency in terms of another. For ex- 
ample, a gang plow may have high capacity in terms of horses 
and low capacity in terms of men. The same plow may have 
high efficiency in terms of men and low efficiency in terms of 
horses. Neither should one be confused by the fact that land 
with high capacity may have low efficiency and vice versa, 
e.g. heavy clay land may require much more labor per acre 
than a silt loam and for this reason, though the crops be larger, 
the product per unit of labor, z.e. the efficiency, may be smaller. 
Variation in the economic efficiency of land was emphasized 
by Ricardo; variation in the efficiency of managers was elabo- 
rated by Walker. Clark called attention to the variation in 
   
-P-A-G-E-131
    
THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 119 
the usefulness of all the factors, but failed to recognize the 
distinction between differences in capacity and differences in 
efficiency, apparently assuming no differences except differ- 
ences in capacity. Capacity and efficiency, under given condi- 
tions, are concepts as different as length and breadth. For 
example, if the capacity of a cow is measured in terms of the 
land, labor, feed, and other equipment properly associated 
with her, and if her efficiency is measured in terms of the value 
of her product per dollar of expense for the other factors, it 
becomes obvious that while two other cows of half the capacity 
and the same efficiency might be equally useful, because the 
product per unit of outlay would be the same, two other cows 
with the same capacity each as the one in question but possess- 
ing only half the efficiency could not be substituted for her 
without loss, for they would cost twice as much to keep and 
would yield only the same total product or only one-half as 
much per unit of expenditure. 
A few facts may help to make clear the ideas in mind. In 
recent years a great deal of first-hand study has been made of 
the conditions of productivity in agriculture. The census 
method and the accounting method have been largely used in 
this work. In Table V are found the results of a careful census 
of the farmers centering about Dallas, Barron County, Wiscon- 
sin. There were fifty-one farmers in the community. The 
returns which these farmers secured per dollar of annual outlay 
varied from 77 cents to $3.05. In this calculation the annual 
outlay included all operating expenses, including depreciation 
and interest. A glance at the second column of figures in 
Table V shows a variation from $1734 to $293 in the annual 
outlay with which these farmers associated themselves. The 
former are termed variations in efficiency; the latter are desig- 
nated differences in capacity. (Though the writer would 
recognize that perfect adjustments may not exist with regard 
to the amount of land, labor, and equipment associated with 
some of the men, yet these men are probably striving for the 
optimum.) The variations in total product per man range 
from $3644 to $686. The farmers, as the residual claimants,

received payments for their efforts varying from $1961 to 
minus $338. It will be noted that, so far as the figures in this 
table.go, there is no definite relation between a man’s capacity 
as measured by his outlay and his efficiency as measured by 
product per unit of outlay. A man with high efficiency may 
have low capacity and the man with high capacity may have 
any degree of efficiency. These facts are brought forward to 
illustrate the well-known fact of variations in the ability of 
men and to note that at least two measuring sticks are needed 
if we hope accurately to measure man’s ability. 
Table VI illustrates some of the differences which exist in one 
class of instruments of production, namely, cows. This table 
shows the best ten and the worst ten of 398 cows entered in 
the Wisconsin Dairy Cow Competition during the two years 
1909-1911, each cow being in the contest one year. It will be 
noted that the difference in value of product per dollar’s worth 
of feed consumed by the best ten cows varied from $2.71 to 
$2.19 and that the range for the least efficient ten cows was 
from $1.25 to 92 cents. The total range was from $2.71 to 
92 cents, the average result of the best ten was $2.38, and that 
of the least efficient ten was $1.11. In Table VI a common or 
standard price level was used in calculating the cost of the feed 
and the value of the product. It remains, however, to be ex- 
plained that these cows were not all under the same manage- 
ment. The differences in product per unit of feed are due, 
therefore, to differences in the efficiency of men as well as to 
differences in the efficiency of cows. The cows in one herd in 
the same barn, receiving the same feed, care, and management, 
must be compared if cow efficiencies are to be isolated. 
The fact of differences in efficiency and capacity granted, are 
they significant from the standpoint of production? From the 
point of view of the effective management of farms the signifi- 
cance of this analysis of the grades of the factors of production 
lies in its relation to the problem of right choice of the instru- 
ments of production which are to be combined under a given 
management. If difference in market valuations corresponded 
to each man’s estimate of the variations in the usefulness

  THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 123 
of these instruments, the problem of choice would be solved, 
but this is not true. The individual valuations of given instru- 
ments of production have a wide range above and below the 
market valuations. 
It is this discrepancy between individual and market valua- 
tions which makes it incorrect to take the position that one 
dollar’s worth of agricultural land, labor, or equipment is as 
useful to the farmer as any other dollar’s worth, that market 
prices eliminate the necessity of careful selection of the grades 
of the factors of production. It is, therefore, necessary for 
each farmer to use great care in the choice of the productive 
agents with which he associates himself. 
An hypothesis which has been made and which bids fair to 
prove a practical guide is that the factors which possess high ef- 
ficiency should usually be associated together. The high efficiency 
land should be occupied by the high efficiency farmer operating 
high efficiency equipments. For example, suppose the superior 
efficiency of “A” grade land over “B” grade is due to its 
location near the market, so that while the physical product 
per unit of the other factors (of given efficiency) is the same as 
on “B” land, the value of the product is twice as great on 
“A” as on “B” grade land. Assume also that farmers “I” 
and “II” vary also in their efficiency, which shows itself in 
the fact that the physical product which “I” can grow on a 
given grade of land is twice as great as that which “II” can 
grow. Under these conditions each farmer can secure twice as 
much product, in value, from the “ A ” grade land, as from the 
“B” grade land, but the extra product is twice as great for 
“1” as for “II.” Each man can afford to pay more for “ A” 
grade land, but the one with the higher efficiency can clearly 
afford to pay more than his less efficient competitor, and hence 
competition will tend to give the best locations to the most 
efficient users. 
Variations in efficiency of two pieces of land may be due 
solely to differences in the amount of physical product per unit 
of labor and equipment put upon them. In this case is it important 
that the more efficient farmer operate the more efficient land? 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  124. AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The reply is, he should occupy that which is to him the more 
efficient land, recognizing the fact that all men will not grade 
land the same for a given purpose and that gradations vary 
greatly for different purposes. Assume our two pieces of land 
to be corn land and that one piece has more fertile soil, greater 
warmth, better drainage, etc., so that each stalk of corn grows 
more vigorously and yields a larger ear of corn and more fodder. 
Then call to mind the character of the differences which may 
exist in the men. The more efficient man uses better judgment 
regarding the time to plow the land so that the soil is kept in 
good tilth; he harrows at the proper time, driving in the right 
direction to smooth and crumble the land, thus reducing the 
holes and the clods to a minimum; he uses judgment in select- 
ing the seed corn, which makes sure that each grain is vigorous 
and of the right variety for the particular soil; he plants the 
optimum amount of seed at the optimum depth; he cultivates 
at the right time; he maintains the stand of corn, that is, does 
not cover or otherwise destroy the stalks of corn; he eliminates 
the weeds; he maintains the soil mulch to hold the moisture 
when needed; and he avoids destroying the corn roots when 
cultivating large corn. For all these reasons he has more corn 
plants growing, and each plant yields more product. 
Is it not obvious that this extra product due to more plants 
and better plants better tilled will be greater on the more efficient 
than on the less efficient land? To simplify the concepts con- 
fine the discussion to the influence of the stand of corn. The 
more efficient farmer has 95 per cent stand while the less effi- 
cient farmer has an 8o per cent stand of corn. That is, where 
there is room for 100 stalks of corn the one will grow 95 while 
the other will grow 80. Is it a matter of some importance that 
these extra 15 stalks be on the more efficient land, which means 
15 large ears instead of 15 small ears of corn? From the stand- 
point of the competing farmers there is clearly an incentive for 
the more efficient farmer to seek the more efficient land and to 
outbid his less efficient competitor for this land. 
The same principle applies to the choice of cows, horses, and 
hogs as to the choice of land. A good cow has been said to
-P-A-G-E-137
THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 125 
produce 15 per cent less milk under inefficient care than under 
efficient care, where other factors are the same. Fifteen per 
cent of the product of efficient cows would be a greater loss 
than the same percentage loss on a low efficiency cow. Further- 
more, in the handling of a herd of high efficiency the efficiency 
of the animals will fall from decade to decade under low effi- 
ciency management and improve under high efficiency manage- 
ment, so that regardless of first choice the efficiency of the cow 
tends to correspond to that of her keeper. 
It will readily be recognized that gradation of land and equip- 
ments, as well as men, are very different for different purposes. 
To avoid confusion on this point it is best to recognize the 
presence of gardeners, dairymen, grain farmers, beef men, hog 
men, sheep men, cotton farmers, tobacco farmers, and various 
combinations of these such as are found in the various types of 
farming in the United States to-day. Each farmer falls into 
some class with respect to type of farming. He has only to 
consider grades of land and equipment which competition 
among types of farming has left to his type and then choose on 
the basis of gradation in this class in terms of his ability. 
The practical man who recognized this principle of choice 
may properly suggest that its application is not easy for the 
reason that it involves knowledge of one’s own relative efficiency 
as well as that of land and each of the kinds of equipment. 
The truth is, it takes time for a farmer to find his place in the 
system. If he ranks himself too high, losses will bring him 
down, for he cannot compete successfully with his competitors. 
If he rates himself too low, he makes some profit but not so much 
as if he had the use of more efficient land and equipment. The 
practical method is to be modest in rating one’s self and gradually 
adjust equipment to ability by taking every opportunity to 
secure more efficient cows, horses, or machines when profits are 
clearly increased by the change. The adjustment to land 
qualities cannot so easily be made a gradual process. It is 
often necessary to change farms. During the period of tenancy 
is the time to work this point out so that when land is purchased 
it will be of the right quality.
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Does it make any difference which grades of capacity are 
chosen by the farm manager? Only in the same sense that 
the mason finds use for stones of different sizes in building a 
wall, each occupying space according to its size, where there 
are spaces of varying dimensions to be filled. If land is of low 
capacity more can be used. If horses and cows are of low 
capacity but of the desired efficiency, more can be kept. The 
workman of low capacity may prove the right choice if only a 
small increase in help is needed. The city man who wants to 
produce milk for his family may find a cow of small capacity 
_ more profitable than one of high capacity because she supplies 
his needs and he has no profitable means of disposing of the 
surplus. The man who has small demand for horse labor may 
find the small capacity horse most profitable, while the man 
with much horse labor to perform might find such a horse un- 
profitable; thus variation in capacity helps to adjust the pro- 
portions of the factors, especially where the scale of the business 
is small. 
In the choice of workmen it often happens that a man has 
high capacity for some purposes and low for others. For 
example, a boy may cultivate corn, cut hay, or drive a tedder 
or rake, showing the same capacity as a man who has much 
greater capacity than the boy in pitching hay in the field or 
handling the hay in the mow. By taking advantage of these 
differences and using each man where he shows the greatest 
capacity, profits may be increased. 
There are various conditions which retard the movement 
toward the most economical combination of the factors. Ig- 
norance of better opportunities and desire to stay where one’s 
folks live are common hindrances to adjustment. Inherited 
wealth often enables an inefficient man to hold a highly efficient 
piece of land for a lifetime without being crowded out, whereas 
the same man would have found his level in a few years with- 
out the aid of his inheritance. 
How does the right combination of efficiency grades affect 
total productivity? Total productivity of society is greatly 
increased by the combination of the factors which throws the
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 127 
most efficient factors together. The productivity of the in- 
efficient is minimized, it is true, but the productivity of the 
most efficient is at the maximum, and the total product, it is 
believed, is greater than any other combination would yield. 
True social economy calls for this combination, and it is these 
facts of variation in efficiency which give hope that competition 
may gradually lift the average of efficiency by the elimination 
of the marginal and the multiplication of the better and the 
best. So long as this process is in operation poorhouses will 
be needed, but is it not cheaper to provide for the inefficient 
in this way than to have them match their inefficiency with 
land and equipments which have high potential productivity ? 
Variations in efficiency and capacity have an important rela- 
tion to the problems of the distribution of wealth, with especial 
reference to the ownership of land. It is the wide range in the 
efficiency and the capacity of farmers that makes possible the 
saving of the funds essential to the climbing of the agricultural 
ladder. Assuming the acceptance of the theory of the relation 
of prices of agricultural products and marginal costs, it follows 
that every man possessing efficiency superior to that of the 
marginal farmer may save from the surplus and rise to a higher 
rung on the agricultural ladder. It would seem also that the 
man of high capacity may save more than his competitor of 
equal efficiency who possesses lower capacity on the assumption 
that the man of high capacity has the same standard of living as 
his competitors. 
It is not so much the purpose here to show how these factors 
have worked themselves out as it is to show the individual 
farmer how better to adjust himself to his complex environment, 
and to call the attention of the agrarian statesman to this fact 
of variations which are too often overlooked because it is easier 
to deal with the average, which is often a dangerous basis for 
practical legislation. From a political point of view this fact 
of variation gives basis for aid in education and for poor relief. 
In choosing a farm the grade of land selected should correspond 
to the degree of efficiency of the farmer. A highly efficient 
farmer can make some profit on any grade of land. On the
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
most efficient land the chances for profits are greatest for 
the most efficient man, but the chances for losses are also 
greatest if one prove to be less efficient than his competitors. 
The safe thing for a young man to do is to rent land on shares 
and take the best land he can get. If he handles land well, he 
will be sought by the men who have the best farms. This 
will more or less automatically put the tenant farmer on the 
land corresponding to his ability. When he is ready to buy a 
farm, his experience as a tenant will give the basis for judging 
whether he should buy the choicest land and pay the price, 
which will necessarily be high, or take land of second or third 
class for which the competition is not so keen and for which 
an appreciably lower price will be asked. 
Having decided to be a farmer, the young man should next 
decide upon the kind of farming he is to follow. This should 
be settled only after considering carefully his personal abilities, 
his likes and dislikes, and the results which he can hope to 
secure in the various kinds of farming. 
Having settled upon the kind of farming to be followed, one 
should select land which competitive forces have set aside for 
this kind of farming. To insist on dairying in a hog and beef 
cattle district, or to insist on being a grain farmer in a region 
especially suited for and actually being used as a dairy district 
is to invite failure at the first move. 
The character of the soil is an important consideration both 
from the standpoint of total product per acre and the cost per 
acre to operate. It is too common for farmers who are seeking 
land to judge the land entirely by the product per acre without 
looking into the cost per acre involved in growing the crop. It 
costs very much more to prepare a seed bed in one kind of soil 
than in another. In other words, the power of the land to 
absorb labor is very important, for the greater the input per 
acre the fewer the acres a man can operate and, the profit per 
acre being the same, the smaller will be his total profits. The 
starting point, in determining which land to buy, is to calculate 
as best one can the total net return which can be secured from 
the different farms which are available and then buy the one
-P-A-G-E-141
    THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 129 
which will leave the largest amount as net profit after deduct- 
ing interest on the price of the farm, taxes, repairs, and deprecia- 
tion. 
The proportion of the time the land is in condition to be 
worked is of importance in choosing a farm. This is especially 
important on a grain farm where the field labor is the only form 
of directly productive labor. It is less important on a dairy 
farm, yet is not to be ignored. ‘The variations in the amount 
of time the land is in condition to be worked may be due to 
differences in the amounts of rainfall or to differences in the 
character of the soil. Where there is considerable rainfall, 
sandy soil can be worked many more days per month than 
the silt loams, and either of these soils will be dry enough to 
work more days per month than the heavy clay soils. While 
this is important in determining the acres of corn or oats one 
man can care for, having the land dry very quickly has its 
drawbacks. The heavy lands may be far superior for grazing 
and may yield crops enough larger to compensate for the loss 
of time due to wet land. An ideal arrangement would be to 
have more than one kind of land in the same farm. In the 
absence of this it is very important for the farmer on heavy 
land to have productive labor to do when he cannot work in 
the field. 
Location with respect to the market is important, but is in- 
volved in the question of the efficiency of the land. The farmer 
who can produce the most product on a given piece of land 
gains the most by being located near the market, whereas the 
farmer with low efficiency would gain least by being near the 
market, for two reasons: he would have less to haul to the 
market, and his time is worth less for other work than hauling 
his products. 
Sanitary conditions should be given careful consideration. 
A farm may be worth less than nothing if its occupier is in 
danger of losing his health or that of the members of his family 
by living on the farm. The seriousness of conditions of this 
kind depends upon the ease with which the sanitary conditions 
can be improved.

The character of the neighbors is worthy of close inspection 
before buying a farm. The farmer cannot go it alone. He 
has to do with his neighbors continually in one way or another. 
The character of the people of a neighborhood will have much 
to do with the conditions of the roads, the absence or presence 
of noxious weeds, the cost of threshing, silo filling, and other 
farm work which is done codperatively. The moral standards 
of the community as is evidenced by the prevalence of drunk- 
enness, illegitimate children, and other evils on the negative side, 
and in terms of good schools, effective churches, and a clean 
social life on the positive side, should be looked into with great 
care. The moral standards of a community stamp themselves 
upon the younger generation. The older folks not in sympathy 
with the standards of the community may have an opportunity 
for doing some valuable missionary work, but unless they use 
rare tact they may find themselves cut loose from the life of 
the community as a result of their efforts. 
It should never be forgotten by the farmer who is trying to 
buy a farm that he is buying a home as well as a place to work. 
His life and that of his family may be influenced more by the 
character of the farm and the community as a place to live 
than by the farm as a place to make money. The richness of 
farm life consists largely in things which money cannot buy.

profitable proportions.)

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 
The law of variable proportions. In the production of a given 
crop, like corn, all the factors of production, land, labor, and 
equipment, are brought into play; but there is no definite pro- 
portion in which they must of necessity be combined in order 
to bring the corn crop into existence. The quantity of corn 
produced on a given area of land will be greatly influenced, 
however, by the amount of labor and equipment associated 
with the land. 
The law of increasing and diminishing returns operates when 
increasing amounts of labor and equipment are associated with 
or applied to a given area of land. A small amount of labor and 
equipment per acre may yield 20 bushels of corn to the acre, 
double the amount may produce 45 bushels per acre, whereas 
three times the amount may produce only 58 bushels per acre. 
In the first instance the law operates to give increasing re- 
turns, in the second, diminishing returns. 
At any given time and place there is a certain proportion 
in which the factors combine most profitably. If less or more 
than a certain amount of labor and equipment be associated 
with a given area, the profits will be less than they should be. 
The proportion which is right for one farm at a given time may 
be wrong for another. This may be due to differences in the 
physical and biological character of the land or to differences 
in location with respect to the market. Also it is true that 
the adjustment of proportions which yield maximum profits 
on a given farm at one time may be wrong at another time on 
the same farm. This will result when there is a change in the 
relative costs of the factors of production. 
132 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
    THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 133 
Changes in the relative abundance of the factors of produc- 
tion, resulting in changes in their relative cost to the producer, 
arise out of differences in the rates of increase of the supply 
of land, labor, and equipment. If the land supply increases 
less rapidly than labor and equipment, land will become rela- 
tively more valuable and should be used more sparingly. As 
a matter of fact, there was a period in the past century when 
the area in farms was increasing more rapidly than the number 
of farmers. This was due to the settlement of the prairies 
aided by railway transportation. During this period the tend- 
ency was to use more land per man and the great scarcity of 
men in the presence of such large supplies of good land stimu- 
lated the invention of machinery of every sort to enable man to 
associate himself with more land. In recent years the supply 
of land is increasing less rapidly and there is every reason for 
believing that in the future the more rapidly increasing sup- 
plies of men and equipment in agriculture will demand that 
land be cultivated more and more intensively. This implies 
that the farmers will need to be alert on the question of in- 
tensity of culture. 3 
While the question of right proportions, of which intensity 
of culture is one phase, involves all the factors equally, it has 
been common to center the discussion about the utilization of 
land. This has grown out of the feeling that land is usually 
the more slowly increasing factor, and must be used more 
intensively as the years go by. Hence, intensity of culture 
becomes the central problem in the study of the proportions of the 
factors, though the proportion between men and equipment 
is also important and has been changing rapidly in the past 
century. 
Table VII compares the increase in the acreage of improved 
farm land with the increase in the number of persons engaged 
in agriculture and the value of farm implements and machinery 
from 1870 to 1910. According to this table the land increased 
more rapidly than the workers up to the close of the 19th 
century, but the workers increased more rapidly than the land 
from 1900 to 1910. With the exception of one decade, ma-

chinery increased more rapidly than land, and in every instance 
more rapidly than land workers.

Intensity of land utilization may be viewed from various 
standpoints, as follows: 
1. A given crop in a given year projected in advance with 
a view to a general estimate as to the right proportion between 
Jand area and working force. 
2. A given crop at a given stage in the progress of its pro- 
duction with a view to maximum economy in the utilization 
of the operating force on a given day when there are various 
demands for the operating forces. 
3. A given farm organization as a whole at a given time. 
The amount of farming of various kinds which can be done on a 
given area with optimum results with the understanding that 
the operating capital and the labor supply may be adjusted in- 
definitely with a view to securing maximum economy of organi- 
zation for the farm as a whole. 
4. The entire agriculture of a country in a given year. 
The first, third, and fourth points of view may be studied 
historically and geographically as well as at a given time and 
place.

THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 135 
All these problems may be studied from the individual and 
from the social point of view. 
Standpoint 1. Most of the discussion of this subject has been 
from standpoint 1. In the discussion of this problem, land, 
labor, and capital equipments are assumed to be at the disposal 
of a manager (a farmer), who is attempting to use men and 
equipments upon land in the proportions which will yield 
maximum profits for himself as the responsible party who stands 
the losses or secures the profits. The problem of how much 
land, labor, and equipment he should operate is another ques- 
tion of proportions which will be considered in the chapter on 
the size of farms. 
To illustrate the economic principles underlying the proper 
degree of intensity of culture on a given farm in the production 
of a given crop, let us first suppose that the farmer can get as 
much land of a given grade as he may want to use, without 
paying anything for its use. Under such circumstances, how 
many composite units made up of laborers and capital-goods 
should be associated with an acre of land? For the purpose of 
this illustration let us assume a small composite unit, the use 
of which costs the farmer one dollar. It is obvious that in the 
production of corn, for example, the application of one of these 
units, per acre of land, would ordinarily produce very little, 
if any corn at all. It is possible that the expenditure of two 
units would produce a small crop; but then the third unit would 
increase the product more than the second, the fourth more 
than the third, and so on until a point of stationary returns 
has been reached, after which the succeeding units may be said 
to continue for a time to add less and less to the total product, 
until a point may be reached where further applications would 
add nothing to the total product. Thus in agricultural produc- 
tion the returns to succeeding composite units made up of laborers 
and equipments may be said to follow the law of increasing returns 
until a point of stationary returns has been reached, after which the 
law of diminishing returns per succeeding unit commences to operate. 
This may be illustrated by means of a diagram. In Fig. 7 
the composite units of labor and capital-goods applied to a given  
-P-A-G-E-148
  136 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
acre of land are measured on the line AB, commencing at A. 
The line AJ’B represents the increasing and diminishing re- 
turns per succeeding unit. Having in mind land with a given 
degree of productivity, the distance between the lines AB and 
AI'B will depend upon the degree of efficiency possessed by 
the farmer, and also upon the character of the laborers and 
capital-goods which he employs. For this reason it will be 
necessary to keep in mind a given farmer employing a given 
grade of laborers and capital-goods, as well as a given piece of 
land. With these conditions in mind we may speak of the area 
lA 
c D& FO ROH Ke Ni iM       
AC'C (Fig. 7) as representing the product which would result 
if but one unit were employed per acre, and of the area CC’D’D 
as representing the increase in the product due to the addi- 
tion of the second unit and so on for the succeeding units. As 
illustrated in Fig. 7, the product of each succeeding unit is 
greater than the one preceding it until six units have been ex- 
pended, after which each succeeding unit may be said to yield 
a smaller product than the one immediately preceding it. 
It may be true that the law operates to give stationary 
returns per succeeding unit during the application of a few 
units, after the final point of increasing return has been reached 
and before the starting point of diminishing returns per succeed- 
ing unit has been reached. It may be true also, that the line 
AI’ in Fig. 7, should rise rapidly with the application of one 
particular unit, say the fourth, and then remain stationary or 
even fall with the application of the fifth, and then rise very 
rapidly again with the application of the sixth. The introduc- 
tion of drainage or the use of commercial fertilizers might bring
-P-A-G-E-149
    
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 137 
such a result. There are at present no data from which to 
calculate the exact curve which the returns per succeeding unit 
will follow, but the general rise followed by a general fall is a 
matter of common observation. 
With this illustration (Fig. 7) before us, suppose the farmer 
has one thousand of these composite units, made up of laborers 
and capital-goods, to expend in agricultural production. In 
other words, suppose that this farmer has found that he can 
secure the largest net profit when he operates just one thousand 
of these units of labor and capital-goods. With free land at his 
disposal, how many acres will he use and how many units will 
he employ upon each acre? Will he apply five units per acre 
and use two hundred acres of land? No, his expenditures will 
produce a greater total product when he employs six units per 
acre and confines himself to one hundred and sixty-six and two- 
thirds acres. But will this make the labor and capital-goods 
most productive? On first thought one might answer yes, 
because the seventh unit adds less to the product than the sixth; 
but upon looking more closely into the matter, it is apparent 
that there is no good reason for ceasing to apply more units 
simply because the point of diminishing returns per succeeding 
unit has been reached. The seventh unit may add less to the 
total product than the sixth, and yet add more than any of 
the first four units, and the average product per unit may be 
greater when seven units have been applied than when only six 
have been expended. Hence the total product of the thou- 
sand units may be greater when seven units have been applied 
to each acre and only one hundred and forty-three acres of 
land employed. But at what point should the farmer cease 
to increase his applications per acre of land? It is obvious that 
there is a limit, that, for example, a thousand units expended 
upon one acre of land in the production of Indian corn would 
yield a smaller return per unit than when more land is used and 
the number of units applied to each acre is more limited. But 
what is the limit? It is true that in the case before us the sixth 
unit increases the total product more than any unit before or 
after it, but all units cannot be sixth units. The first, the second,
-P-A-G-E-150
ee eT eee mercer 
138 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
and the third are indispensable; and, in case a farmer can 
manage a fixed number of these composite units, made up of 
capital-goods and laborers, when employed in the production 
of a given crop without reference to the area on which they are 
employed, the highest average return per unit is the thing which 
he should seek, for with a fixed cost per composite unit this will 
enable him to secure the largest net profit per composite unit, 
consistent with the proper intensity of management, and hence 
will enable him to secure the maximum total net profit for his 
exertion. 
In the illustration (Fig. 7) the average product per unit 
curve AP is represented as increasing rapidly until the sixth 
unit has been applied and then less rapidly until a point is 
reached where the return per increment is just equal to the 
average. At this point the average return per unit reaches the 
maximum, and the application of another increment would 
reduce the average product per unit employed. The thousand 
composite units are used in the most economical manner when 
the acreage is so limited that the number of units applied to 
each acre is just sufficient to yield the maximum average return 
per unit. For example, the highest average return would be 
gained by the application of X units in the case before us in 
Fig. 7, where the location of X is determined by the fact that 
the rectangle AVX'X is drawn in such a manner that its area 
equals the area AJ’X’X, which represents the total product 
of X composite units of the two factors laborers and capital- 
goods. That part of the rectangle lying between the line H H’ 
and the line JJ’, for example, represents the average return 
per unit. Had the applications stopped at J, after the appli- 
cation of but six units, the total product would be represented 
by the area AJ’I, or the rectangle AW NI, and the average 
return per unit would have been less. Likewise had the appli- 
cations been increased to nine units, the average return per 
unit would have fallen. Hence a curve of increasing and dimin- 
ishing average returns may be drawn, based upon the increasing 
and diminishing returns of the successive composite units 
of labor and capital-goods. This curve of averages is repre-  
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 139 
sented by line A X’P (Fig. 7), which is so drawn that it will 
pass through the upper right-hand corner of any rectangle which 
has AC, AD, AE, etc., or any part thereof, as a base and which 
incloses an area equal to the area AC’C, AD’D, AE’E, etc., 
respectively, as rectangles AW NI and AV X’X have been 
drawn in Fig. 7. 
As illustrated in Fig. 7, the curve of averages reaches the 
highest point at X’ and the highest average product per unit 
is gained by employing seven and two-fifths units per acre, 
and it will be seen at once that, since all the charges which must 
be deducted are a fixed amount per composite unit of labor and 
capital-goods applied, the higher the average return per unit, 
the greater will be the farmer’s net profit per composite unit, 
and under the assumption that, in the production of a given 
crop, the same amount of managerial activity is required per 
composite unit without regard to the area of the land on which 
it is employed, and when there is no rent to pay, the applica- 
tions should increase until. the point of maximum average re- 
turns per unit is reached. This is the most extensive agricul- 
ture that is consistent with the greatest net profit to the farmer 
under any circumstances, in the production of a given crop; 
and, under the above assumption as to demands upon managerial 
activity, it is the most intensive that is in accord with the 
farmer’s highest economic interest, where the use of land may 
be had free. 
It has been said! that the intensity of culture should be in- 
creased until the final increment adds no more to the total 
product than enough to cover the cost of that unit. If, in Fig. 
7, for example, the value of the product represented by a rect- 
angle whose sides are KL and LL’ equals the cost of securing 
the use of a composite unit, the applications should, according 
to this view, be increased just to point L. It is true that this 
would enable the farmer to secure the largest net profit per acre 
of land, but unless he be a marginal farmer, in which case the 
two statements coincide, it would reduce his net profit per 
composite unit of the other factors. If the farmer were able

-P-A-G-E-152
  140 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
to operate a given number of acres of land without regard to the 
degree of intensity of culture, then it would be desirable to 
secure the largest net profit per acre; but if he can, to advan- 
tage, manage only a given number of units of labor and equip- 
ment, regardless of the area on which it is expended, then he 
should seek the largest net profit per unit of these factors.

Table VIII is intended to show the difference in the degree of 
intensity of culture resulting from the application of the two 
competing theories of intensity of culture. The assumption 
here is that two men, A and B, are farming the same grade of 
land, but that while A is a superior farmer, B is a marginal 
farmer. Column three illustrates the degree of intensity car- 
ried to the point where the product of the last increment 
most nearly approximates the cost. According to this theory 
there is more intensive application of labor and capital by 
Athan by B. Farmer A could have made more profit by stop- 
ping at an earlier point and using a proportionate amount of 
additional land with the additional labor and capital. Column 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
    THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 141 
four shows the point of maximum average gross returns which 
would yield maximum return per unit of outlay where no rent 
had to be paid. Column five shows the net return per dollar 
of expenditure after deducting a five dollar rent. It will be 
noted that the payment of rent tends to force the intensity of 
culture to a much higher point. Note also that the degree of 
intensity for farmer B is the same in columns three and five; 
whereas the superior farmer would act in one way if he followed 
the first theory and in another way if he followed the second 
theory. 
It may be well at this point to devote a few lines to the 
assumption, that, within the limits of the variations in intensity 
of culture which is likely to exist in the production of a given 
crop, the same amount of managerial activity is required per 
composite unit composed of the two factors, laborers and equip- 
ment, without regard to the area of the land on which it is 
employed. 
In general, we believe this assumption to be very near the 
truth. In the production of corn, for example, the amount of 
managerial activity required for each laborer with the team and 
tools which are used by him would be the same whether thirty 
acres of the crop were cultivated three times, or the same 
laborer and capital-goods were used in cultivating twenty-two 
and one-half acres of corn four times. Certainly if one must 
choose between this assumption and the assumption that the 
same amount of managerial activity is required for each acre 
of land, regardless of the intensity of culture, there is little 
question as to the choice. It is doubtless true that one man can 
superintend the operations of more laborers and capital-goods 
when they are brought together under one roof as in a large 
manufacturing plant than when they are distributed over a vast 
area of land; but on the farm and in the production of a given 
crop we believe that, as a rule, the demand upon the time and 
energy of the manager, per composite unit of the two factors, 
laborers and capital-goods, will remain practically the same 
regardless of the area on which such unit is expended. We 
shall proceed, therefore, upon this assumption in our attempt to
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
ascertain the degree of intensity of culture which is most eco- 
nomical where land has acquired value so that payment must 
be made for its use. 
When a fixed sum per acre must be paid for its use, land should 
be cultivated more intensively than when it could be had free. 
Suppose, for example, that three dollars per acre must be paid 
for the use of land. We may think of this rent as taking all 
of the product of the first four and one-half, or R composite 
units, of the factors applied (Fig. 7). In this discussion we shall 
speak of that share of the product which is left after paying 
the rent, as a met return. The farmer may be said to receive 
no net return from his expenditures until the rent is paid. 
Should he cease his applications when R units have been em- 
ployed, the product would just pay the rent and he would lose 
the cost of the labor and equipment, besides receiving nothing 
for his trouble. Whatever he produces by further applications 
is the fund which gives rise to the net profits after the wages 
of hired laborers and the payment for the use of capital-goods 
have been withdrawn. 
When there is no rent to pay, the farmer seeks the highest 
average gross return per unit of expenditure; but, where a fixed 
rent must be paid, he no longer seeks the highest average gross 
return, but the highest average net return per unit, for, under 
the assumption that, in the production of a given crop, the 
amount of managerial activity per composite unit of laborers 
and capital-goods remains the same regardless of the area on 
which it is expended, the largest net return per composite unit 
of these factors will enable the farmer to secure the largest net 
profit per unit of managerial activity put forth, and this is the 
goal in agricultural production when vie ved from the stand- 
point of the farmer. 
The average net return per unit follows the law of increasing 
and diminishing returns in the same manner as the average 
gross return; but, when a fixed rent is paid, the line of increas- 
ing average net return starts at point R (Fig. 7); for all of the 
product up to point R is required to pay the rent, and the aver- 
age nef return at that point is zero. After the application of five 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 143 
units the average net return per unit will be represented by 
one-fifth of the area RR’ H'H; for the total return minus the 
rent is represented by the area RR’ H’H, and since five units 
have been applied this net return must be divided by five 
to find the average. Likewise after the application of the sixth 
unit, it will be one-sixth of the area RR’I'I. After the ap- 
plication of the seventh unit, the average will be one-seventh 
of the area RR’K'K. Thus the line of average net returns 
(line RY’P’ in Fig. 7) rises rapidly until the line IJ’ is crossed, 
after which it rises less rapidly until it crosses the line J’ B, after 
which it falls. When a fixed rent is paid, the line of average 
net returns can never rise so high as the line of average gross 
returns, and the point Y’, where the line of average net returns 
reaches its maximum distance from the base line AB, will 
always be farther to the right than point X’; and hence the 
highest average net return per composite unit of labor and 
capital-goods employed on land for which a fixed rent must 
be paid will be gained by a more intensive culture than when the 
same land could be had rent free. 
When the farmer follows the rule of seeking the largest net 
profit for his exertion, the degree of intensity of culture on a 
given piece of land and in the production of a given crop will 
vary with the amount of the fixed rent which is paid for its 
use, — the greater the amount of rent, the higher the degree 
of intensity, for when a higher rent must be paid for the use 
of the land a more intensive culture is necessary if the highest 
average net return is to be secured. 
If the proposition is reversed and we think of successive 
increments of land being brought under a given number of 
composite units of the other factors, the simple statement will 
suffice that the amount of land should be increased until the 
final increment of land adds just enough to the total product 
to pay the cost of securing the use of the land. It will readily 
be seen that this would result in the degree of intensity of cul- 
ture which will yield the largest net return per composite unit 
of the other factors. On the assumption, therefore, that one 
1 See “The Distribution of Wealth,” by T. N. Carver, pp. 80-83.
-P-A-G-E-156
  AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 144 
farmer can manage a given number of the composite units of 
labor and capital-goods without regard to the area on which it 
is expended, the same conclusion will be arrived at with regard 
to the proper degree of intensity of culture where land can be 
had free or where a fixed rent must be paid for its use, whether 
one adds successive units of the other factors to a given area 
of land until the average net return per unit reaches the maxi- 
mum, or whether one adds successive acres of land to a given 
number of the composite units of the other factors until the 
final increment of land adds just enough to the total product 
to pay the fixed rent which must be paid to secure the use of 
said increment of land. 
The conditions are practically the same where the farmer 
owns the land which he cultivates as where he pays a fixed rent, 
the only difference being that he has paid for the perpetual 
use of the land, whereas the tenant pays annually for its use. 
The payment of a share rent does not tend to increase the 
intensity of culture. The share rent increases as the total prod- 
uct increases; and it may be thought of as taking some fixed 
portion, say one-third, of the product of each succeeding unit 
of labor and capital-goods applied, so that the farmer gets 
only two-thirds of the product of each unit, and his share reaches 
the highest average return per unit with the same degree of 
intensity which yields the highest average gross return per 
unit. Hence, where the share tenants follow their own self- 
interest, they will farm no more intensively on the best land 
when less productive grades of land have been resorted to than 
when only the best grade was cultivated. 
To illustrate this point, draw a curved line from A to Bin 
Fig. 8, at such a distance from lines AZ’B and AB as to leave 
two-thirds of the area of each section between the lines 4B and 
AIB. Then draw a line through the points ‘of average net 
returns per unit employed, in the same way as the line of average 
  gross returns was drawn. This new line o 
the line of maximum net returns per unit 
crosses the line AJB. The point Z will en the line AZ P’ 
one-third of the f viene will reach 
distance from X’ to X and neither to the right nor to the left 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
    THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 145 
This means that the point of maximum net returns is reached, 
in the case of a share tenant, with the application of the same 
number of units which yield the largest average gross product. 
Other things remaining the same, how will a change in wages 
and interest influence the intensity of culture? Suppose that 
wages and interest fall twenty per cent; will it then pay the 
farmer to invest more units per acre? If the rent should re- 
main the same as before the reduction in wages and interest, 
and if the foregoing reasoning with regard to the proper in- 
tensity of culture be true, the degree of intensity in terms of 
  Ficure 8 
quantities of labor and capital-goods which would yield the 
largest net return would not change; but the expenditure per 
acre in value would be decreased and the profits of the farmer 
would be increased in the same proportion. This higher profit 
might increase the demand for land, however, and this would 
likely result in a rise in rents, after which it would pay to in- 
crease the quantity of labor and capital-goods employed, 
excepting in the case of the share tenant. 
The influence of a rise or fall in the price for which the prod- 
uct can be sold will influence the degree of intensity only 
as it may affect the amount of rent which must be paid for the 
use of land. As prices rise the rent tends to rise and the degree 
of intensity should be increased, while the reverse is true in the 
case of falling prices. This is true because land of a given degree 
of productivity is limited, and as labor and capital-goods increase 
in quantity, land of a less productive grade must be resorted to, 
and without improvements this is possible only when wages and 
interest fall or prices rise. But there is a close relation between 
L
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the gross return which the marginal land will yield and the 
amount of wages and interest which labor and capital-goods can 
command on other grades of land. This means, of course, that as 
the less productive lands are resorted to the rent which the com- 
petitors will offer for the better land will rise, and then the largest 
net return, and hence the largest net profit per composite unit 
of labor and capital-goods, can be gotten only by more intensive 
culture. 
In this connection the influence of lower wages and lower 
interest and higher rents, upon the choice of crops, should be 
reviewed, because it often happens that a rise in rents will 
result in the change from a crop which requires but little ex- 
penditure for labor and capital-goods per acre to one that re- 
quires large expenditures per acre. 
That degree of intensity of cuture which brings the largest 
net profit to the landowning farmer or to the tenant who has a 
fixed rent to pay seems also to be that degree of intensity 
which makes the total amount of land, labor, capital-goods, 
and managerial activity employed in the agricultural industry 
most productive. It appears, therefore, that at this point there 
is a harmony of interests between the individual and society 
as a whole; but it would seem that the interest of the share 
tenant is not in harmony with the interest of society as a whole 
in this regard, for if the better grades of land are farmed as 
extensively as the interest of the share tenant seems to dictate, 
poorer grades of land would need to be used in order that the 
labor and capital-goods of the country be employed, and some 
of this labor and equipment on the marginal land would be 
creating a smaller product than it could be made to yield if 
employed in farming the better grades of land to a more in- 
tensive degree; and, therefore, while a given share tenant could 
increase his net profit by this extensive culture, such culture 
would reduce the total value of the agricultural productions of 
the country as a whole. 
The interest of the share tenant is also out of harmony with 
that of the landlord in this regard. Since it is to the interest 
of the landlord that the share which accrues to him as rent 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
    THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 147 
shall be as large as possible, he may desire that the intensity 
of culture be carried to the farthest extreme. So long as an 
increment of expenditure will add anything to the product it 
might seem to his interest to have the increment applied, for 
it would add to his income. Thus, stated in its extreme form, 
it would seem that while the share tenant would desire to farm 
so extensively that the average gross return per unit of labor 
and capital would reach the maximum, the landlord might 
desire that the gross return per acre should reach its absolute 
maximum, without regard to cost per unit of the product. 
It is evident that the interest of the landlord as well as that 
of the share tenant is here in conflict with the interest of society 
as a whole; for to follow what seems to be the landlord’s high- 
est economic interest in this particular would result in the re- 
duction of the total agricultural product which could be pro- 
duced with a given amount of social energy. 
But it becomes apparent that the landlord will always be 
unable to induce his share tenant to farm any more intensively 
than an owner of land or a tenant with a fixed rent finds it to his 
interest to farm his land, for the tenant could otherwise do 
better by paying a cash rent or by taking up new land of nom- 
inal value. On the other hand, the share tenants are, in the 
United States, quite generally under the direct supervision of 
the owners of the land, who insist that the share tenant should 
farm as well as the owners would do. It may be true that this 
ideal is not often perfectly attained, and yet the tendency is 
for the landlord to so bring his influence to bear upon the share 
tenant that the social loss due to share tenancy is, perhaps, 
not very great. 
In fact the advice of a landlord who himself is a successful 
farmer often results in an important increase in the product of 
the farm to the benefit not only of the landlord and the tenant 
who shares the profits, but to the consumer of the goods. 
Standpoint 2. We have here the more immediate problem of 
determining the proper intensity of culture at a given stage in 
the process of producing the crop. This depends largely upon 
the exigencies of the weather. The farm manager cannot tell in
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
advance the extent to which corn cultivation and clover harvest 
will conflict ; neither can he know exactly how much time there 
will be for field work. Having made his general plan for the 
year, he must, from day to day and week to week, distribute 
his labor where it will count for most. If more labor can be got 
temporarily, that will be distributed on the same basis, i.e. 
put in where it will count for most. Under these conditions 
the area has already been determined, but unusual weather 
conditions may put the farmer ahead or behind his regular 
schedule. In either case the correct policy is to make such use 
of the available resources as will add most to the total profit 
of the farm regardless of the assumptions made in projecting 
the plans at the beginning of the year. Plans are valuable 
but emergencies often demand their readjustment. 
Standpoint 3. The problem as it confronts the farmer in 
action is found in standpoint 3. How can the amount of business 
under a given farm organization be increased, i.e. how can the 
gross income be increased in such a manner as will add most to 
the farmer’s net profit? Take a dairy farm, for example, 
where the sale of whole milk is the principal source of income. 
To increase the gross income means essentially to increase 
the milk check. (1) The milk check can be increased by im- 
proving the sanitary quality of the milk so as to secure a higher 
price for the product. This requires greater expenditure for 
labor in the dairy and on the milk route, but makes no increased 
demand for feed or land. (2) The milk check may be increased 
by producing a greater quantity of milk of the same quality. 
This may be done by: 
A. Securing cows of greater efficiency and capacity. This 
increases the investment in cows and makes some change in 
the demand for feed, which may be produced as a result of more 
labor on the farm on the same area or the feed may be pur- 
chased. 
B. Securing more of the same quality cows, building greater 
barns, hiring more laborers, buying or raising more feed. 
Which of these things to do depends on relative costs. If 
more feed is raised it can be done by more intensive culture or 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
    THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 149 
by expansion to a greater area. Intensity of culture and the 
area of the farm are in a real sense reciprocals. 
Standpoint 4. Intensity of culture may be viewed from the 
standpoint of the entire agriculture of a country. When 
viewed in a given year there is found a very wide range in the 
degrees of intensity in the different parts of the country. On 
the cheap marginal lands the expenditure per acre is small and 
the farming is said to be extensive, while on the high-priced 
lands near the markets, the expenditure per acre is large and 
the farming is said to be intensive. This difference may be due 
to the application of more labor and capital to a given kind of 
production or to the production on the higher-priced land of 
crops which require (under any condition) very much more 
labor and capital per acre. For example, market gardening is 
much more intensive than wheat growing and is usually found 
on higher-priced land near the market. 
Likewise, when the whole country is viewed geographically 
it is found that certain kinds of land are farmed more intensively 
than others because of the character of the soil, more labor and 
capital being required to yield optimum results on certain kinds 
of land than on other kinds of land. This simply means that 
the capacity of certain kinds of land is higher than that of other 
land, due to differences in the physical properties of the land. 
Viewed historically, an increase in intensity in the utiliza- 
tion of land is the result of a relative increase in the popula- 
tion. On the other hand, a decrease in population or an in- 
crease in the available agricultural land supply will make a more 
extensive culture desirable, unless improvements in equipments 
are such as to make possible the greater use of machinery, so 
that, while the application of human labor is less per acre, this 
may be counteracted by the use of more capital per acre, and 
in this way maintain or increase the intensity of culture as a 
basis of a greater per capita consumption. 
The proportions of laborers and equipments. In farm organi- 
zation it often happens that a fixed number of laborers must be 
combined with certain equipments; for example, one man is 
required for each self-binder; but in many cases it may be a
-P-A-G-E-162
150 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
matter of indifference, aside from the element of profit, whether 
the work be done by hand or by horse power and machinery. 
In the production of wheat, for example, the proportion of 
capital-goods might be reduced and the same produce obtained 
by increasing the number of laborers. The reverse is also true. 
But while these variations may be made arbitrarily they have 
an influence upon the amount of the farmer’s share of the prod- 
uct. Of all the various operations necessary to produce and 
market a bushel of wheat, some can be performed more cheaply 
by the use of horses and machines, others by means of laborers 
without horse power. 
Where the farmer’s aim is to have the net profit which is 
left after paying the hired laborers and paying for the use of 
the equipments as large as possible, every operation should 
be performed by laborers, if this method will lower the costs 
of production, increase the product, or in any other way in- 
crease the net profits; and everything should be done by means 
of horses and machines or other forms of equipments, which, 
can be done to better advantage in that way. It may often 
happen that the cost of performing certain farm operations can 
be reduced by the use of horses and machinery in the place of 
laborers, but it may at the same time happen that the product 
resulting from these operations is also reduced. It is not 
always true, therefore, that every operation should be per- 
formed in the least expensive manner, in fact, it may easily 
happen that a more expensive method will result in the largest 
net profit. 
One point never to be overlooked in considering the desir- 
ability of substituting laborers for equipments or vice versa, 
is the relative demand which will be made upon the time and 
energy of the manager. Any change in the proportions of these 
factors in the composite unit which will increase the amount 
of managerial activity per such unit must sufficiently increase 
the farmers’ net profit per composite unit to balance the loss 
which results from the fact that fewer units can be brought 
under a given amount of managerial activity. 
One consideration which favors choosing machinery rather 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE PROPORTIONS OF THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION 151 
than laborers as a means of accomplishing a given result is 
the greater control over equipments. In case of great demands 
for workers in other localities, laborers may leave the farmer 
with his crops in the fields, whereas the horses and machines are 
certain to be at the farmer’s disposal when he wants them. 
Laborers can make themselves more valuable by becoming 
more dependable. 
Where the substitution of the one factor for the other makes 
no change either in the quantity of the product or in the amount 
of managerial activity required, the rule is a simple one: where 
there is a choice between using laborers or capital-goods in the 
performance of certain operations, choose the cheaper method. 
And yet, the qualifying phrases in this formula are so important 
that the problem is far from being a simple one, and in many 
cases, perhaps in most cases, it is the more fundamental prin- 
ciple of seeking the largest net profit per unit of managerial 
activity which must be kept uppermost in mind. 
A change in the rate of wages without a corresponding change 
in the cost of equipments, or vice versa, will necessitate a read- 
justment of the relative amounts invested in the employment 
of laborers and in the employment of equipment. As wages rise 
relatively to interest and depreciation charges on equipment, 
there should be less labor and more capital-goods employed. 
Improvement in machinery often makes it profitable to substi- 
tute capital-goods for laborers. The self-binder, the hay- 
loader, and the windmill are examples where this has been true.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE SIZE OF FARMS 
THE size of farms is usually measured in terms of area. It is 
obvious that all land is not equally useful and that some uses 
of land make very different demands for labor and capital per 
acre than others. From certain points of view, a 20-acre 
fruit and vegetable farm may represent as much business as a 
thousand-acre wheat farm. There are many measures which 
might be used. For example, the total investment, the number 
of laborers, the number of horses used, the number of cows 
milked, the number of cattle and hogs fattened, or the number 
of sheep on a sheep ranch, may give a more accurate basis of 
judging of the importance of a given farm than a bare state- 
ment of area. Area is, however, common to all farms, and 
next to the number of persons employed, is perhaps the most 
satisfactory starting point for the discussion of the size of farms. 
The farms of the United States have been classified for statis- 
tical purposes into ten size-groups based upon area. The 
table on the following page shows the number and percentage 
of the farms found in each size-group in 1910. 
This table shows a wide range in the size of farms in the 
United States in 1910. A study of the tables in the census 
volumes shows that this is a condition of long standing. A 
study of conditions in foreign countries shows the same wide 
range in the size of farms. It would seem, therefore, that there 
is no one size of farm which can be generally recommended, 
but that the proper size for a given farm depends upon many 
variable conditions. It becomes a matter of importance, 
therefore, to outline the principles which determine the size 
of farms, with a view to the proper adjustment of the size in 
the case of each individual farmer.

While there is no one proper size for farms in general, there 
is always a proper size of farm for a given man, at a given stage 
of his own development, on a given type of soil, in a given line 
of production, with given labor and market conditions. In 
general, cotton farms are smaller than wheat farms. For ex- 
ample, the average area of improved land in farms in Bell 
County, Texas, where more than half the improved land is in 
cotton, was about 70 acres in 1910, whereas the average was 
about 270 acres in Barton County, Kansas, where more than 
half the improved land was in wheat. If Washington County, 
Mississippi, is compared with Cass County, North Dakota, 
the contrast is even more striking. In the former county, 
the average area of improved land in farms is 23 acres; in the 
latter it is about 470. In the Mississippi county, over 47 per 
cent of the improved land was in cotton, while in the Dakota 
county 44 per cent was in wheat. 
These facts indicate that the crop grown is a factor in deter- 
mining the size of farms; but that this force is not operating 
alone is shown by the wide range in the size of wheat farms and 
of cotton farms. In general, the cotton farms of the black 
prairie of Texas are larger than the cotton farms of the Yazoo 
delta in Mississippi, as is indicated by the counties compared  
-P-A-G-E-168
156 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
above. In Bell County, Texas, more than 96 per cent of the 
farmers are white, whereas in Washington County, Mississippi, 
over 95 per cent of the farmers are colored. As has been noted, 
the improved area per farm is three times as great in the former 
as in the latter. This gives a strong suggestion that the capac- 
ity of the individual farmers is a potent factor in determining 
the size of farms. 
». In 1900, farms were classified by size and by principal sources 
of income. The statistics show a wide range in the size of farms 
used for any one purpose; for example, there were cotton farms 
in every size group from under 3 acres to over a thousand 
acres, but the most common size was from 20 to 50 acres. 
Hay and grain farms showed also a wide range, but the most 
common size was from 100 to 175 acres. Live stock and dairy 
farms were most largely in the group ranging from 50 to 175 
acres. The most common size of fruit and vegetable farms was 
from 20 to 50 acres. Thus, while there is a wide range in sizes 
of farms in a given line of production, the dominant size varies 
with the kind of agriculture carried on. 
Topography is a factor in determining the size of farms. Ina 
broken country where the fields are small because of the limited 
areas of plow land found lying together, and where large ma- 
chines cannot be used to advantage because of the unevenness 
of the ground, the cultivated area in farms is usually small. 
This same condition may result in large farms for grazing 
purposes. 
The climate influences the size of farms in many ways. In 
California, where the wheat crop can be left standing for some 
time after it is ripe, a given crew can harvest a much larger 
area of wheat than in the more humid regions where the crop 
must be cared for in a few days. 
The number of days per week the land is dry enough to work, 
during the season when crops are being put in and cared for, 
is an important factor in determining how many acres of each 
crop can be handled per man and team, and hence how large 
an acreage of improved land will be found per farm. 
The character of the farm work influences the size of the
-P-A-G-E-169
THE SIZE OF FARMS 157 
unit of organization. The large area demanded per man gives | 
rise to two conditions which point toward the economy of a | 
relatively small unit of organization when compared with many 
lines of manufacture. The distance which workmen must 
travel in going to and from their work is against large farms. 
The time required in going to and coming from the fields is 
subtracted from the time devoted to the field work. -*’ Further- 
more, the fact that the work is spread over a wide area makes 
close supervision of the workmen impracticable. Every 
workman on a farm must be interested and largely self-direc- 
tive in carrying out the day’s work if the farm is to prove 
profitable. This has resulted in the major portion of the work 
on most farms being done by the farmer and his family. 
It has been said, “ The typical American farm is a family- 
farm.”’ Limiting this statement to America is unnecessary. | 
The statement is equally true of France and of Germany. If 
the farms of the whole world were considered, it would still 
be true that the typical farm is a family-farm. The world over, 
farming is very generally organized in accordance with what 
has been called the “ domestic system” in industry. There 
has been talk about the “ factory farm ” and corporation farm- 
ing, but nothing of general economic importance has been 
developed along this line. The family-farm is, for the present 
at least, the farm to keep in mind in studying the economic 
problems of the farm manager. Hence the working force of 
the family is an important consideration in deciding upon the 
proper size of farm for a given farmer. 
The fact that adding to the size of the farm adds to the work 
in the home and detracts from the pleasure of living, tends 
to limit the size of farms. The farmer considers the extra 
work for his wife involved in taking an extra man into the 
home. The writer uses the word “home” advisedly. The 
hired man is not satisfied simply to eat and sleep in the house. 
He expects to be made to feel at home, and if he does not feel 
at home, he will move along and try another place. The 
farmer and his hired man work side by side in the field, and 
in the barn; they sit side by side at the table, and it is per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
fectly natural that the employee should expect to be con- 
sidered a part of the family. 
The size of the farm often grows with the family. As the 
boys become able to help on the farm, the successful farmer 
adds to its size with a view to having enough land for his 
labor force, and with a view to having a piece of land for 
each of the boys when they have grown up and want to com- 
mence farming for themselves. Under these circumstances, 
the splitting up of the farm as the boys start in on their own 
account often results in a reduction in the size of the farm as 
the family is dispersed. 
How will the decline in the size of the American farm family 
affect the size of farms? In the first place, it will not only re- 
duce the number of family workers per farm, but will tend to 
reduce the number of paid laborers on farms. The principal 
supply of satisfactory farm laborers is the boys from farm 
families where the degree of prosperity has not been such as 
to enable the farmer to expand his farm so rapidly as the family 
labor supply has increased. With the decline in the size of 
families, this source of labor is greatly reduced, and the laborers 
who can be drawn from other sources are not so satisfactory 
from the point of view of being skilled, subject to control, and 
reliable. The most satisfactory solution of the farm labor 
problem in many parts of the United States is to reduce the 
size of the farm to what can be handled by the family. 
There are those who would not carry this so far as to reduce 
the labor force below two men. “ There are many farm opera- 
tions that require two men, so that no matter how small the 
farm may be, one man cannot do all the work to good advan- 
tage.” The whole question involved here is: will the advantage 
of having another man right at hand for doing the two-man 
jobs counterbalance the social and economic burden of keep- 
ing him all the time? The answer to this question depends upon : 
(x) the managerial ability of the farmer in making a margin 
of profit on hired labor, (2) his tact in handling men so as to 
prevent the hired man from being a nuisance in the home, 
(3) the possibility of hiring a married man who is efficient,

and whose family does not detract too much from the well- 
being of the neighborhood (an effective man married to an 
effective woman usually operates on his own account very soon, 
and cannot be had on the wage basis), (4) the possibility of two 
single-handed farmers arranging to help each other on the 
tasks requiring two men. 
Economy in the utilization of machinery. ‘“ Most of the 
common farm machinery can be used to do the work on a 200- 
or 300-acre farm, as well as on a small farm.” 1 There is truth 
in this statement so far as certain types of machines are con- 
cerned. In the production of corn, no very expensive ma- 
chinery is used unless a corn binder is used. Plows can be had 
of varying capacity from one horse to the great tractor plows. 
In the production of small grain, the binder is the one machine 
usually owned by the farmer which costs over one hundred 
dollars, and in humid regions and on rich land, the acreage to 
be cut by one machine cannot be expanded much beyond what 
two men can put in without the risk of losing a part of the 
crop. The two single-handed farmers will find it profitable 
to own a binder jointly and work together in grain harvest. 
The question always arises, “‘ Will the greater degree of utiliza- 
tion of a given machine compensate for the other disadvantages 
involved in increasing the size of the farm? ” 
This leads to a discussion of the unit of organization on the 
farm. On the great wheat fields in California, the unit may 
be based upon the combined harvester and thresher. This ma- 
chine, the crew to operate it, and the land, men, horses, 
and other equipment required to raise that amount of wheat 
which can be cut during the normal harvest period, may here 
make up the unit of organization. In the corn belt of central 
Illinois, where corn is the principal source of income, one man 
and team of from two to four horses, a plow, a harrow, a corn 
planter, a corn cultivator suited to the horse power decided 
upon, becomes the basic unit of organization. This same unit, 
with the addition of a grain seeder, a binder, and a mower, will 
care for oats and hay in combined amounts equal to the area 
/      1G, F. Warren, “Farm Management,” p. 257. 4

  160 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS. 
of corn handled.. The area of corn which this one man and 
equipment can prepare the land for, plant, and keep clean the 
month after planting, plus the amount of land used for sub- 
sidiary purposes, becomes the unit of economical farm organiza- 
tion. One or many of these units may make up a given farm, 
depending upon the managerial ability of the farmer, the 
conditions in the household, and the size of the family labor 
force. In the corn belt, a farm which will not employ one unit 
is clearly too small. To be of proper size, the farm should 
make demand for one, two, three, or more of these units, but 
should not fall halfway between. A farm which is too large for 
one man, and too small for two, cannot be economically or- 
ganized for corn production. 
In the dairy regions where milk or cream is the principal 
source of income, one man and the number of cows he can milk 
and produce hay and silage for, becomes the unit of organiza- 
tion. While the unit for any given type of farming varies 
greatly in land-using power from place to place, and from man 
to man, the dairy unit is an unusually flexible one on the family- 
farm, because of the possibility of using children and women 
in the dairy. 
The significance of the unit system lies in the fact that in 
general the increase in the area of the farm cannot go on by 
small additions of an acre now and an acre then, but must be 
made in considerable jumps if the area is to conform to the 
demands of economical farm organization. The difficulty in 
making these jumps often results in adjusting the organization 
to the available area, sometimes with too high a degree of in- 
tensity of culture, sometimes with too low a degree of intensity 
to yield maximum profits. One method of adjusting the size 
of a farm is to change from one farm to another, and while this 
is objectionable from the standpoint of the cost of moving, it 
is often the most practical way of adjusting the size of the farm 
to the ability of the farmer and his potential labor force. 
The problem of right proportions between managerial activity 
and the other factors of production is one of the most important 
problems related to the size of farms. No rule can be laid down,     
  
-P-A-G-E-173
    THE SIZE OF FARMS 161 
but it is worth while to discuss the principles underlying this 
problem. In applying a given amount of managerial activity 
to land, equipment, and laborers the law of increasing and 
diminishing returns must be considered. If the managerial 
activity is expended upon too small a farm, the profits will fail 
to rise to the maximum through lack of business, and if the 
farm is too large, the expenses will absorb too large a pro- 
portion of the income, and the profits will not be at the maxi- 
mum. 
This point may be illustrated by means of the following table, 
in which the number of composite units (a unit may be thought 
of in this illustration as one laborer and the amount of capital- 
goods and land which should be associated with him) to be 
associated with one unit of managerial activity (which may be 
thought of as the amount of such activity which one farmer 
wishes to devote to production) is increased seriatim from 
one to eight, and as a result of the increase in the number of 
the composite units brought under the one management, the 
net profit per composite unit is represented as gradually falling 
from $260 to $80, while the resulting net profit per unit of 
managerial activity is represented as increasing until after the 
fifth composite unit is added, atter which it is represented as 
falling.

The figures here used are selected more or less arbitrarily 
to illustrate the general truth that, as the number of the com- 
M
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
posite units brought under one management is increased, the 
average return per composite unit, and hence the average net 
profit per composite unit will fall, but that for a time this fall 
in the net profit per composite unit is more than balanced by 
the increase in the number of such units, and the net profit per 
unit of managerial activity continues to increase until finally 
the point is reached where the net profit per unit of managerial 
activity reaches its maximum, and if the number of composite 
units associated with a given amount of managerial activity 
be increased beyond this point, the net profit per unit of the 
latter, and hence the total net profit which the farmer will 
be able to secure as a manager, will be reduced below the pos- 
sible maximum. Any conditions which retard the bringing 
about of this adjustment not only reduce the profits of the 
farmer, but increase the cost of the nation’s food supply. 
One permanent occasion for differences in the size of farms is 
the differences in the amount of energy the men are willing to 
put into the operation of a farm. 
Having decided upon the number of the composite units of 
the factors which should be brought under a given amount of 
managerial activity, that is, the intensity of the management, 
other things remaining the same, the size of the farm should vary 
directly with the amount of effort which the farmer is willing 
to put forth in its management. The farmer’s energy is, of 
course, limited, and after he has performed a given amount of 
work per day, it requires more and more inducement to impel 
him to increase his activity. It may be that a few hours of 
work each day would be a pleasure to him and that the profits 
which he received from these few hours’ labor would be much 
more than enough to induce him to perform the work of manage- 
ment; but when hour after hour is added to the time which he 
must spend in the fields, and the rapidity of his movements 
from place to place must be increased more and more, in order 
that the farm may be properly operated, each succeeding addi- 
tion to the time and the speed of his work becomes more and 
more wearisome, while at the same time the wants which are 
to be satisfied by the fruits of this increased labor become less 
   
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE SIZE OF FARMS 163 
and less important to him, until finally the point is reached 
where the increase in the net profit is not sufficient to induce 
the farmer to increase his activity. 
This can be illustrated by means of a diagram. In Fig. 9 
the succeeding composite units of the agents are measured 
,

on the base line A X, and the net profit which the farmer re- 
ceives for managing these units is represented by the area 
between this line and the line BY, so that the area ABC'C, 
for example, represents the net return from one of the composite 
units. If the idea of a composite unit seems too abstract to 
the reader, he may think of one of these units of the agents of 
production as being one laborer and the amount of land and 
equipment associated with him. That share of the net profit 
per unit which is represented by the area lying below the curved 
line PP’ may be thought of as the amount which is required to 
yield to the manager a pleasure in consumption of goods equal 
to the pain of performing the work of management. Assuming 
that he devotes exactly the same care to each unit, as he con- 
tinues to increase the number of units the perpendicular dis- 
tance between lines AX and BY will remain constant; but 
a larger and larger proportion of the net profits of the succeed- 
ing units will be required to counterbalance the pain or disutility 
accompanying the added exertion required for the manage- 
ment of such units, hence the curve PP’ will gradually rise 
until at some point it will cross the line BY, beyond which 
point the pain of exertion exceeds the net profit to be secured. 
The curve PP’, representing the increase in the pain cost, 
may start high up the line AB and rise rapidly with a lazy 
man, or it may start far below A, rise slowly and not reach
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
line BY until some point far to the right of M’. This illus- 
trates one of the causes of differences in the capacity of men 
which is a permanent cause of differences in the size of farms. 
From this point of view it becomes obvious that there can be 
no one size of farm which will pay best for all farmers, and hence 
the attempt to draw conclusions from statistical studies regard- 
ing the proper size of farms sheds little or no light upon the 
problem of the individual farmer, however valuable these 
figures may be for the study of geographical and historical dif- 
ferences in the organization of farms. 
Which is the most desirable from the social point of view, the 
large, the medium-sized, or the small farm? Waving in mind that 
farmers vary greatly in their degrees of efficiency, it would seem 
socially desirable to have the managing done by the most effi- 
cient farmers; for in this way the labor would be under more 
efficient direction than where every man directs his own ac- 
tivities. Another advantage of large farms lies in the fact that 
they facilitate a more extended division of labor. There can 
be a shepherd who devotes all of his time to the sheep, and for 
this reason he can better understand his business. So it is in 
every line of work on the large farm. Machinery can be used 
to better advantage on the large farm. The efficient manager 
of the large farm can better determine what will pay and what 
will not pay, so that he is in a much better position to direct 
the labor power of society to the best advantage. The man 
who is toiling in the field as well as managing the farm is less 
likely to be far-sighted at a time when he is tired, and at such 
times he may sacrifice much of the profits for a relatively small 
saving of labor. 
On the other hand, what improves the efficiency of the manage- 
ment in this way may lower the quality of the workmanship. 
There are some men, it is true, who seem to work better for 
others than for themselves, but with many others the opposite 
is true. There are vast numbers of small farmers who do not 
use good methods, who, because of their interest in that which 
is their own, will put forth greater effort than they would if 
they were working for some one else. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
    THE SIZE OF FARMS 165 
It has been said that certain kinds of farming lend themselves 
more readily than others to large-scale operations; that wheat 
farming, for example, is especially suited to large-scale opera- 
tions, but that as this one crop system gives way to diversified 
farming, the advantages of smaller farms assert themselves. 
The owner of young stock takes more pains with them than he 
would if he were a hired laborer. It is certainly true as a general 
tule that the man who owns the lambs or pigs will lose more 
sleep and go to more trouble than will a hired man. “ He 
that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep 
are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth : 
and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The 
hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the 
sheep.” 
The management of a farm is something which must be dif- 
fused through the details of the work. There is a withdrawal of 
the efficient manager’s ability from the details and a concentra- 
tion of it upon the general supervision of the farm as the size 
of the farm increases. As more and more of the details are 
delegated to hired men these details are not looked after so 
well as they might be if looked after directly by the master. 
Cato, a Roman agricultural writer, says: “‘ Neither the assi- 
duity and experience of the hired manager, nor the power and 
willingness of the master to lay out money in improvements, 
are so effectual as this one thing, the presence of the master; 
which, unless it is frequent with the operations, it will happen 
to him as in an army when the general is absent ; all things will 
be at a stand.” And again, Pliny says: “‘ The ancients were 
in the habit of saying that it is the eye of the master that does 
more towards fertilizing a field than anything else.” 
The question of the most desirable size of farms, when viewed 
from the standpoint of the most economic use of the productive 
energies of a country, is a matter of determining the point at 
which the advantages of the more efficient general supervision 
as to crops, field-systems, intensity of culture, etc., are balanced 
by losses in the execution of the details of the work with less 
skill and personal interest.
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The purely economic conclusion is, therefore, that every man 
who can make more by hiring to a farmer should do so, and every 
farmer who can increase his net profits by hiring men and in- 
creasing the size of his farm, without increasing the amount of 
effort which he need put forth, should do so. Each man would 
then get the largest net income, and the value of the farm 
products of the country would reach the maximum. 
But the actions of men are not controlled entirely by economic 
motives. There is a pleasure to be derived from being one’s 
own master, which is often prized more highly than many of 
the things which money can buy. As a result many men re- 
main independent farmers when they could secure a larger 
income’ for themselves and add more to the value of the farm 
products of the country by being hired men under the direc- 
tion of more efficient managers. And yet it may be that this 
economic loss is compensated for in the social gain that comes 
from self-directed activity. 
The proper size of farms is a subject which has commanded 
the attention of agricultural writers since ancient times. “ The 
ancients,” says Pliny, “ were of opinion, that, above all things, 
the extent of farms ought to be kept within proper bounds. 
Wherefore it was a maxim amongst them, to sow less and plow 
better. Such, too, I find, was the opinion entertained by 
Virgil, and indeed, if we must confess the truth, it is the wide- 
spread domains that have been the ruin of Italy, and soon will 
be that of the provinces as well... . With that greatness of 
mind which was so peculiarly his own, and of which he ought 
not to lose the credit, Cneius Pompeius would never purchase 
the lands that belonged to a neighbor.” 
Columella, another Roman agricultural writer, also taught 
moderation in the size of farms. “To the other precepts,” 
says he, “ we add this, which one of the seven wise men has 
pronounced as a maxim, that holds true in all ages, that there 
ought to be limits and measures of things; and this ought to be 
understood, as applied not only to those that do any other 
business, but also those that buy land, that they may not buy 
more than they are fully able for. To this is applicable the 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
    THE SIZE OF FARMS 167 
famous sentence of our poet, You may admire a large farm, 
but cultivate a small one; which ancient precept this most 
learned man (Virgil), . . . expresses in verse. This, too, 
is agreeable to an acknowledged maxim of the Carthaginians, 
a very acute nation, That the land ought to be weaker than the 
husbandman; for, when they struggle together, should the 
former prevail, the master must be ruined. And, indeed, there 
is no doubt, that a small field well cultivated produces more 
than a large field ill cultivated.” ‘‘ Among the maxims of the 
ancients, recorded by Palladius,”’ says Dickson, “ there is one 
to the same purpose with that mentioned by Columella, ‘A 
small farm cultivated is more fruitful than a large farm 
neglected.’ ”
-P-A-G-E-180
  CHAPTER XV 
FARM LABOR AND WAGES 
Tue farm labor problem presents different aspects in the 
different parts of the United States. On the general farm in 
the northern part of the country the typical wage worker on 
the farm is a young man who is temporarily a member of the 
farmer’s family as well as a part of the farm crew. He eats 
at the family table, reads the paper in the family living room 
after supper, puts his soiled clothes into the family washing, 
and in general shares the life of the farm home. If he is a good 
hand he will soon become interested in the work of the farm and 
attached to the farm by many ties other than the wages he 
draws. This young man is a part of the farm family, and 
whether he is contented with the life and interested in the work 
depends largely upon the success of the farmer and his wife 
in developing sympathetic and happy relations. There are 
no class distinctions. The young man expects to become an 
independent farmer and feels that he is gaining skill, money, 
and credit which will enable him to establish a home of his own 
in a few years. His life and his motives tend to make him a 
fine workman and a good citizen. 
The farm with a separate boarding house for the hired men 
has problems of its own. Much of the personal touch is lost. 
The spirit of the group about the boarding table is not that of 
a family group. The interests of the farm are secondary in 
the minds of the men. The wage is the one important motive 
for remaining on the job. On the wheat farm, transient laborers 
surround this boarding house table for a short time during the 
harvest period and are soon gone. On the large dairy farm the 
table is occupied the year around, but there is a constant shift- 
ing of men. Men are going and new men are coming every few 
168 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
    FARM LABOR AND WAGES 169 
days. The life lacks many of those finer human sentiments 
which make for good farm hands and for good citizenship. 
Another type of wage worker on farms is the married hired 
man who lives in a cottage and works for the farmer by the 
month or by the year. He is usually furnished a cottage, a 
garden, and often some fuel, and a definite amount of milk 
per day in addition to the cash wage he receives. Another 
class of farm workers find places to live and work by the day 
or month for a farmer who pays cash wages for the work done. 
These outside workers become less definitely a part of the farm 
organization. At least two persons (the man and his wife) 
and often others (the children) have to be contented if the 
married workman is to be vitally interested in his work. Un- 
less the family is interested in the farm, he is out of touch with 
the pulse beat of the farm when not at work. 
While the life may be more satisfactory, the outlook of the 
married farm hand is not so alluring as that of the single man. 
A family must live from the wages. The chance of saving and 
becoming an independent farmer is more remote, and as a 
result many such families give up the hope of climbing the 
agricultural ladder round by round from wage earner to tenant 
farmer, then to mortgaged owner and finally to the free owner of 
a farm. Without this outlook and this goal the farm hand 
becomes a different type of man, less to be desired as a work- 
man and as a citizen. 
In those parts of the United States where colored and oriental 
laborers dominate, the conditions are very different. The 
colored laborer lives outside of the farmer’s house in a cottage 
belonging to the farm, or he may live in the near-by village and 
go to the farm from day to day. In the North the typical 
farm hand is a neighbor’s son, in the South he belongs to a dif- 
ferent race. This gives ground for a difference in the status of 
the worker in the farmer’s home, which is to be expected. 
Wages. The wage of the farm hand is a complex thing not 
easily shown in statistical tables. The cash wage is but one 
of the many considerations. The young man who becomes a 
part of the farmer’s family often makes other matters than cash  
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
wages the deciding factor in determining whether he will take 
a position and whether he will hold it when once on the job. If 
it may be assumed that the board, the washing, and the living 
conditions have continued to play the same réle in holding 
the farm hand in his position through the period for which wage 
statistics are available, it will appear that farm wages have 
greatly increased during the past half century. 
The statistics show a rise in the average monthly cash wage 
rate of men hired by the year with board from $10.09 in 1866 
to $18.05 in 1909 and a range in wages in 1909 from $10.91 in 
South Carolina to $37.50 in Nevada. When hiring by the 
season the average monthly rate with board ranged from $12.69 
in 1866 to $20.80 in 1909; without board the rate ranged from 
$18.08 in 1866 to $28.22 in 1909. This rise in the average 
wage implies changes from year to year and differences from 
place to place in the supply, the demand, or the quality of the 
wage workers on farms. 
The wage of a given man at a given time and place is the 
result of a bargain made by the employer and the employee. 
The amount the wage worker will take depends upon his desire 
for employment and the pay offered in the various positions 
open to him. The amount the employer is willing to pay de- 
pends upon the use he has for the man and the number of men 
offering their services. The maximum wage is determined 
by the productivity of labor but the actual wage is the result- 
ant of competition among workers for positions, and among 
employers for men. Variations in the wages in different parts 
of the United States and on the same job are due to differences 
in the qualities of the men, in the degree of responsibility placed 
upon the men, the character of the work, and the conditions of 
life. Differences in different localities may be due to differences 
in the relative abundance of men. It is probable also that dif- 
ferences in the cost of living will have a considerable influence 
upon the wage rate required to draw or hold laborers in a given 
community. For example, wages are low in the South when 
compared with the North. This may be attributed to several 
things. The quality of the labor may be lower. The cost of
-P-A-G-E-183
    FARM LABOR AND WAGES 171 
living is less, hence the supply may multiply on a lower income 
scale in the South. In the western states wages have been 
relatively high, due largely to the relative scarcity when com- 
pared with the East. 
In general the price-fixing forces operate in much the same 
manner in determining the price paid for labor as in determin- 
ing the price paid for the products of the land. One differ- 
ence when compared with a staple of world commerce like 
wheat, arises out of the fact that the supply of laborers does 
not move so readily from place to place to adjust itself to the 
demand as the wheat supply does. Any arrangement which 
will provide for the easy shifting of labor will tend to bring 
the wages to the same level for men of the same ability in 
regions far from each other if the living conditions are the same. 
Variations in wages are in part due to the differences in the 
usefulness of the employees. These differences relate to knowl- 
edge, wisdom, skill, physical strength, interest in the work, 
honesty, and temperament. In general the range in wages is far 
less than the range in usefulness. This is partly due |to lack of 
a good measure of the differences, and partly because there is 
a variety of positions to be filled which require varying degrees 
of ability. Then again, some men possess one quality, some 
another quality, and to the extent that each person finds his 
proper position, he realizes on his strong points. One may have 
knowledge but possess poor judgment. For example, a man 
who knows something of the anatomy of the horse, and knows 
many things about giving first aid to the sick in the horse barn 
and in the dairy, once seriously proposed hitching to a mowing 
machine a 1400-pound three-year-old colt which had never 
had a bridle on before. Another example is that of a man 
who possessed heavy muscles but who used poor judgment in 
deciding how much muscle to use on a given occasion. As a 
result fork handles were continually broken, bolts were twisted 
off, and the cows’ udders suffered from the excessive applica- 
tion of muscle in milking. Again a man may possess good 
qualities but be a grouch. He may hate nearly every one he 
comes in contact with and be kept on the job, at ordinary
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 ‘AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
wages, only because he does a lot of work, but being denied 
the high position his other qualities would have justified, 
because of this lack of self-control and kindly attitude toward 
other people. On the other hand, a young man who at first was 
so ignorant of farming that he walked through the hay up toa 
mowing machine in motion and into the cutter-bar, to his 
sorrow, and who was continually making mistakes which cost 
the farmer money, held a position, drew the going wage, and 
in a few years worked his way to a head position on a good 
farm which he filled admirably. This was made possible be- 
cause of the fine spirit he always showed. He was a master 
at being kind, he was industrious, and he took great interest 
in the work of the farm. These qualities win the farmer and 
he will pay full wages and be patient if he likes the man and feels 
that he is improving in his work. 
The number of wage workers on farms in the United States 
increased from 3,004,061 in 1890, to 4,410,877 in 1900, to 
5,975,057 in 1910. The number of farms increased also but at 
a less rapid rate. In 1890 there were, in addition to the farmers 
themselves, 66 workers or farm laborers for every hundred 
farms. In 1900 there were 77, and in rgro there were 94. 
While this was a period of increase in the labor supply per 
farm, it was also a period when new types of labor-saving ma- 
chinery were coming into use. The gang plow was much more 
widely used at the end than at the beginning of this period. 
The two-row corn cultivator also tended to reduce the demand 
for laborers, and a wider harrow was drawn by the multiple 
teams used on the gang plow. 
Yet in spite of this increase in the supply of labor and the use 
of labor-saving machinery, there was apparently a relative 
shortage of labor as manifested by the talk about the scarcity 
of labor and the actual rise in wages. Either the farmers them- 
selves worked less (which might be their desire as good prices 
made them prosperous) or there was more work per farm. 
This might arise from an increase in the size of farms or from a 
more intensive use of the land. The fact is, the average size 
of farms in the United States fell from 146.2 acres in 1900 to 
   
-P-A-G-E-185
  FARM LABOR AND WAGES 173 
138.1 in 1910. But the average improved acres increased 
from 72.2 to 75.2 per farm. This implies a more complete 
utilization of the farm. The total number of acres of land per 
person engaged in agriculture was about 81 in 1900 and about 
7o in 1910. Thus, in spite of the fact that the investment in 
farm implements and machinery increased from about go cents 
per acre to $1.44 per acre, each person engaged in agriculture 
operated on the average 13.5 fewer acres. This means more 
intensive utilization of the land or less work per man. More 
work may take the form of milking cows. In Wisconsin and 
Minnesota where dairying was on the increase, the acreage per 
man decreased. In Nebraska and Kansas there was an in- 
crease in the number of acres per man. In Indiana, Illinois, 
Michigan, and North Dakota, the ratio changed but little. 
In these grain states new types of machinery would tend to 
have this effect. That is, the more intensive farming was 
accomplished by means of more equipment instead of more 
labor. 
The demand for labor is not an absolute thing. In fact it 
is quite flexible. The farmer can make use of more or less labor 
depending upon the cost of that labor. The farmer can operate 
his farm so as to use much or little labor. He can plow his land 
or graze it; he can feed his grain to cattle or he can sell it; he 
can keep steers and hogs or he can keep milch cows. Which 
he should do depends upon which pays best with a given wage 
scale. The higher the wage the greater the inclination to get 
along with less help and to choose a type of farming which 
makes one free from the hired man. 
Many farmers who own farms and are so well-to-do as to 
desire to hire all the work done on their farms, avoid the whole 
farm labor problem by moving off the farm and putting, as 
share tenant on the farm, a younger man who expects to work 
hard and who has a family willing to help with the farm work. 
The farmer who stays with the farm and faces the farm labor 
question finds that his reward is little greater than that of his 
neighbor who turns over to a tenant the problem of getting the 
work done. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    174 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The man who faces the farm labor problem and who must 
solve it for his own farm finds that custom and sentiment must 
be used for all they will bring if he is to succeed. Custom does 
much to determine a wage rate which had as well be adhered 
to. Sentiment determines how difficult or how easy it is to 
secure and keep laborers at the customary wage. 
One of the real problems is finding the right man for the given 
farm. Just as custom and sentiment have much to do in 
determining the wages the farmer must pay if he decides to 
keep help and leaves him entirely free to hire or not as he 
pleases, so also do these same factors tend to retard the move- 
ment of surplus labor from one place to another. But a still 
more important hindrance to the movement of laborers is the 
lack of knowledge of the opportunities available for the workers 
who are in the region of relative oversupply and who could 
do much better for themselves and serve a more important 
purpose in another region. Lack of knowledge of the exist- 
ence of these men on the part of would-be employers, and when 
they are heard of, lack of knowledge of the ability and char- 
acter of these employees, make the calls few for movements of 
labor excepting in outstanding cases like the annual movement 
of transients to the wheat fields in harvest time. Another retard- 
ing force is the cost of the trip, though in many instances the dis- 
tance is not great if there were a means of knowing where to go. 
There is real need of a network of farm labor bureaus which 
will provide for the information as to the character and loca- 
tion of positions open and the qualities and locations of men 
available to fill the positions. A system of this kind would 
go far toward stimulating better farming for the reason that 
many a farmer now continues to tolerate inefficiency on the 
part of hired men who, if they were in danger of being dropped, 
would do very much better work. If a bureau were at hand 
there would probably be more shifting of laborers for a time 
at least, but the result would be a better fitting of men to jobs, 
a greater productivity, better wages, and larger profits. 
There are various methods of paying labor. The wage 
agreed upon may be for a year, a season, a month, a week, a
-P-A-G-E-187
ee a ee ee 
FARM LABOR AND WAGES 175 
day, an hour, or by the piece. Any of these may be sup- 
plemented by bonuses, profit sharing, or by the sliding wage 
scale. The payment may be all in cash, but usually part in 
cash and part in kind. 
The most common method of hiring labor in the general and 
dairy farming districts is to pay a definite wage per month 
with an agreement extending for a season or for a year. In 
many instances the wage rate is different for the different 
months of the year. For example, forty dollars per month and 
board for the eight months from April to November, inclusive, 
and twenty-five dollars per month and board for the four months 
from December 1 to March 31 has been noted. The funda- 
mental character of this agreement is not very different from 
an agreement upon a wage by the month without any agree- 
ment as to the term of months the arrangement is to con- 
tinue. In most instances the relation is brought to a close as 
soon as both parties are dissatisfied, even if there has been an 
agreement for an extended period of time. 
Harvest workers and transient laborers usually work for a 
definite wage per day when employed and board while at work 
and while lying over because of weather conditions which stop 
the work. 
In England the common method is to pay wages by the week 
and to settle every Saturday night. It is often the custom to 
supplement this regular wage by a bonus at the end of harvest 
if all have done well. In some instances a lump sum is paid 
to the crew for putting up the harvest. Under this plan each 
worker gets his proportion of the lump sum instead of the weekly 
wage. This is a higher wage and is intended to stimulate more 
strenuous effort in the harvest field. 
Profit sharing may take the form of a percentage of the net 
proceeds of the year’s business. This is not very satisfactory 
because it is very difficult to arrive at an accurate statement of 
the profits of a given year. Crop sharing or sharing the gross 
proceeds, which becomes a form of tenancy, is the most satis- 
factory arrangement if the profits are to be divided. 
The bonus has its advantages. For example, if each work-   
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
man in a dairy is to receive an extra wage if the bacteria count 
is kept below a certain number throughout the month, the 
bonus may prove helpful. The bonus may be used as an un- 
promised reward of industry and ability. When wisely ad- 
ministered this has a wholesome effect upon the organization. 
The piece-work wage is used on the farm in getting special 
jobs done. Corn is often husked for so much per bushel; 
plowing is done by the acre; threshing is paid for by the bushel ; 
silos are filled for so much per foot, depending on the size; 
ditch digging is paid for by the rod; and berries are picked by 
the box. Many other examples of piece work will be noted 
by the observing student. 
Piece work is advantageous in that it stimulates strenuous 
activity at a time when there is an unusual amount of work to 
do. It results in a greater justice in the payment of wages 
than is secured from a standard daily wage, for each is paid 
according to the work he has accomplished. The rate of pay 
is usually much higher than the standard wage and is used in 
agriculture to draw an extra supply of labor for a short time 
as well as to speed up the work. 
The main difficulty in the piece-work system arises out of 
the danger that the quality of the work will suffer. For ex- 
ample, in husking corn by the bushel there is danger that the 
unscrupulous workman will take the large ears and leave the 
smaller and less accessible ears in the field. In this way the 
workman may damage his employer more than the work 
done is worth. To be a success the work done under 
the piece-work wage system must be subject to inspection in 
order that the quality of the work may not be slighted. 
The goal of the hired man is the position of an independent 
farmer on a farm of his own. The possibility of attaining this 
goal depends upon many things, all of which center about the 
opportunity to learn how to farm for profit and the opportunity 
and the inclination to save his wages. The young man who 
receives a moderate wage and works for a successful farmer who 
himself is climbing the agricultural ladder and is in the process 
of paying for his farm, is more likely to succeed than the young 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
FARM LABOR AND WAGES 177 
man who receives a high wage for working on a farm owned by 
a wealthy man who is farming for show rather than for profit. 
The latter position teaches the wrong kind of farming methods 
and the wrong kind of spending habits for one who expects to 
save from his wages, become a successful farmer, and later 
buy a farm. The wise young man will give due consideration 
to the environment as well as the wage which the position offers, 
for wisdom, skill, good habits, and credit go farther than money 
in starting one on the safe road to success as a farmer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
     CHAPTER XVI 
FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 
In the discussion of the organization of production in the 
previous chapters, it has been assumed that the farmer is ina 
position to command the instruments of production in quanti- 
ties suited to his ability and to the type of farming he is under- 
taking. It is a well-recognized fact that many farmers do not 
possess wealth enough to own the land and equipments needed. 
Farm credit is essential to good agriculture. If each farmer 
were limited to the equipment and the land he could buy and 
pay for, some farmers would be wasting their energies working 
with too little land or inadequate equipments, while others 
would be trying to operate more than they could use toadvantage 
and be “land poor.” A good credit system is one which will 
facilitate the adjustments between those who have more than 
they can operate to advantage and those who can profit by 
operating more with a view to maximum economy. Such a 
credit system increases the incomes of both parties and increases 
the productivity of the country as a whole, hence a good farm 
credit system is a matter of importance to all consumers as 
well as to many producers of farm products. 
The banks of this country are organized primarily to take 
care of the merchants and manufacturers. These classes of 
business men have a rapid turnover in their business and re- 
quire large sums of money for short periods. The farmer’s 
turnover is not sorapid. He invests in live stock, machinery, 
buildings, and land, all of which are essential to the success of 
his business, but he does not sell them in ninety days and put 
the proceeds back in the bank for a few days and then borrow it 
again for another transaction. The farmer continues to use 
the same land and equipments for a series of years, and if 
178 
    
-P-A-G-E-191
  FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 179 
the banker had a way of viewing this investment and testing 
its worth from time to time, he would be better off lending the 
funds to farmers on long-time loans than lending to business 
men on short-time loans. As it is now commonly operated, 
the bank is too rarely a farmers’ credit institution. 
With the growth of banks owned and controlled by farmers 
and with the work of a few prominent men in educating the 
bankers to the needs of the farmers, the situation is improving. 
It is hoped that one effect of the federal reserve system will be 
the possibility of more rediscounting on the part of banks in- 
stead of such frequent repayment on the part of the borrower. 
The period of the loan should correspond to the farmer’s 
turnover, or, if the property is not turned over in the regular 
order of affairs but held continually, then the term should be 
such as will enable the farmer to gradually pay the debt out of 
his earnings. The merchants’ bank is not organized for this 
latter function and cannot be depended upon. Some form of 
land credit institution is needed for this purpose. 
While the bankers of some parts of the United States are 
meeting the farmers’ needs for short loans, there are other 
localities where this need is not being so well cared for. This 
is more particularly true of the South, where farmers quite 
frequently ask for advances on which to live while making a 
crop. It often happens that the banker is unwilling to lend 
directly to the farmer, but lends to the merchant, who makes 
advances to the farmer, often on ruinous terms. The bankers 
are not solely responsible for this situation, as has been proved 
by an experiment at Red Springs, Texas, located in a county 
where it was said bankers do not lend money to farmers. At 
Red Springs a codperative credit association was organized in 
which the farmers of a neighborhood combined their resources 
as a basis of credit and borrowed money in $1000 lots and lent 
it out among their members in smaller amounts as needed. 
At first the bankers wanted nothing to do with this credit 
association, but after a year’s successful operation the banks 
of the county seat were ready to advance the money needed 
by the association. This is a commendable move on the part  
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of the farmers and illustrates what is often needed in order to 
make farmers desirable bank patrons. The group of farmers: 
organized into an association may be looked upon as a banking 
auxiliary or as a farmers’ borrowing organization. There is 
work for both the farmer and the banker in developing a better 
credit system. 
The trust company deals in a class of long-time loans of which 
the farm mortgage is the typical example as far as they have 
to do with farming interests. Banks are much less attracted 
by farm mortgages. Banks and trust companies are probably 
of much less importance in the making of loans to farmers for 
the purpose of buying land than are the well-to-do farmers 
and the retired farmers of a prosperous neighborhood. These 
men know land values and know the borrowers both with re- 
spect to their character and their abilities as farmers. For this 
reason they are in a strong position to make loans with safety 
and at no expense for investigations, whereas the bank or trust 
company would find it necessary to be at considerable expense 
in ascertaining the merits of each particular case. 
Many of these country money lenders are fine citizens and 
leaders for a better country life who take pleasure in seeing the 
young farmer climb the agricultural ladder to the position of 
financial independence. On the other hand, some of them are 
selfish, close-fisted men who enjoy making foreclosures. In 
general a more systematic and standardized system of money 
lending to farmers on mortgages is desirable. 
The agents for insurance companies make great numbers of 
loans on farm mortgages. These agents are usually men who 
know the local situation thoroughly and who receive a com- 
mission from the company for placing loans. The insurance 
company is in no hurry for its money, hence it prefers long-time 
loans. Neither does it want land, hence it is not anxious to 
make foreclosures. On the other hand, the insurance company 
does not care te receive partial payments from time to time and 
hence the farmer may have to accumulate this savings and hold 
them without interest or receiving a low rate of interest while 
he continues to pay the higher rate for the money he has bor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
    FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 181 
rowed. What is needed is an institution which will lend money 
at reasonable rates and provide for a flexible system of partial 
payments. 
Neither the local money lender nor the agent of the insurance 
company provides farmers with a means of investing their sav- 
ings. The young farmer who saves but a few hundred dollars 
each year cannot hope to lend this money on a mortgage, 
because those who wish to borrow money to invest in land 
generally desire a larger sum at one time. Hence the farmer 
finds the country bank with its low rate of interest about the 
only chance for investing his savings during the years he is 
trying to accumulate enough capital to enable him to invest in 
land. When the time has come for him to make an invest- 
ment by paying half of the value of a piece of land from the 
savings of many years, he is embarrassed by the fact that while 
he has been able to get no more than four per cent for the use 
of his money, he must pay six per cent for the money which he 
wishes to borrow. This should certainly be enough to convince 
the farmer that something is wrong. The important question 
is, Can anything be done to remedy this condition of affairs? 
Something has been done in other countries, and something 
is being done in this country to give the farmer a better credit 
system. More than a hundred years ago institutions were 
established in Germany for the purpose of lending money to 
the farmers at a low rate of interest; and the years have proved 
the wisdom of this course of action. The most important 
institutions for making loans to farmers, in Germany, are the 
district codperative credit associations (Landschaften), which 
are public or semipublic institutions for the purpose of lending 
money on mortgages. These are organizations of landowners, 
who by combining their resources into an unlimited company 
are able to borrow money at a very low rate, — at a rate com- 
parable to that for which the government can float its bonds. 
As the institution is not intended for profit, the loans are made 
to landowners at a rate just enough higher than that paid by 
the institution to cover the costs of carrying on the business. 
Money is lent on mortgages to the farmers and in order to
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
raise the money for such loans, the institution is permitted by 
public authority to issue mortgage bonds to the value of the 
mortgages it holds. As all the members of the association are 
jointly and severally liable to the full value of their lands, the 
bonds are considered excellent investments, and are floated at 
a low rate of interest. 
When the money has been lent to a farmer by one of these 
institutions and a mortgage given to secure the loan, it is the 
regular thing to collect a small amount as a partial payment 
each year until the whole amount is paid. If, for example, 
the rate of interest charged by the institution is four per cent, 
five per cent will be collected each year. Four per cent is 
interest and the one per cent is a partial payment which ac- 
cumulates with interest until at the end of a little over forty 
years sufficient has been paid in to cancel the debt. It is also 
possible for the more thrifty farmers to make other payments 
which shorten the period required for canceling the debt. In 
some cases, these additional partial payments must be paid 
in mortgage bonds, which can be bought at the market price. 
These mortgage bonds make a safe and ready means of 
investing the farmers’ savings. In them the farmer finds a 
safe investment which is as permanent as he may desire to have 
it, and at the same time an investment on which he can realize 
at any time in case he decides to invest in land. The German 
form of the institution may not exactly meet our needs, but it 
is certainly true that the principle of association is especially 
desirable in any system of land credit. 
Not only do such institutions make it possible for the young 
farmers to invest their savings until they are ready to buy, and 
then to borrow money to finish paying for the land, but they 
make it more desirable for the retiring farmers to sell their land, 
as they can invest in bonds which are as safe as the investment 
in land and pay practically the same returns. Thus it is that 
a good credit system is the best means of keeping the tenant 
problem from becoming acute. 
The safety of these institutions is insured by the fact that 
they are district associations. Each institution operates only 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
    FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 183 
within a very limited and well-defined field, so that the officials 
are able to know the men and the land values throughout the 
district. 
The effect of this credit system is shown by the fact that, in 
1895, only 16.42 per cent of the farms in Germany were com- 
posed entirely of leased land; and only 12.38 per cent of all 
the land included in farms was leased land. Indeed, Germany 
is a nation of landowning farmers, while in France. 47.2 per 
cent of the cultivated area is occupied by tenants, and in Eng- 
land the landowning farmer is the exception. Practically all 
the land of England is farmed by tenant farmers or hired 
managers. 
In the last few years much has been done to bring about the 
establishment of a better farm credit system in the United 
States. This has resulted in the Federal Farm Loan Act of 
1915, which provides for the establishment of Federal Land 
Banks which have for their purpose the lending of money to 
farmers at a low rate of interest on mortgage security. 
The Federal Farm Loan Act provides for the division of the 
United States into twelve districts and the establishment of one 
Federal Land Bank in each district. The farmers normally 
come in touch with the land banks through the National Farm 
Loan Association. This association is a local institution made 
up of ten or more farmers of a given district who wish to borrow 
money on farm mortgages. Loans are limited to $10,000 for 
each person. For each hundred dollars borrowed, the borrower 
must subscribe for one five-dollar share of stock in the associa- 
tion. This limits the actual amount one man can secure for 
farm purposes to $9500. The amount of the loan is limited, 
also, to 50 per cent of the value of the land plus 20 per cent of 
the value of the buildings. The farm loan associations indorse 
the mortgages and turn them over to the Federal Land Bank 
of the district as security for the funds borrowed from that insti- 
tution. In turn the Land Bank issues bonds which are sold to 
raise the money which is lent to the association and in turn lent 
to the farmer. It is stipulated in the law that every mortgage 
“ shall contain an agreement providing for the payment of the  
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
loan on an amortization plan by means of a fixed number of 
annual or semiannual installments sufficient to cover, first, 
a charge on the loan, at a rate not to exceed the interest rate in 
the last series of farm loan bonds issued by the land bank 
making the loan; second, a charge for administration and profits 
at a rate not exceeding one per centum per annum on the unpaid 
principal, said two rates combined constituting the interest 
tate on the mortgage; and, third, such amounts to be applied 
on the principal as will extinguish the debt within an agreed 
period, not less than five years nor more than forty years: 
Provided, that after five years from the date upon which a loan 
is made additional payments in sums of $25 or any multiple 
thereof for the reduction of the principal, or the payment of the 
entire principal, may be made on any regular installment date 
under the rules and regulations of the Federal Farm Loan 
Board. . . . No loan on mortgage shall be made under this 
Act at a rate of interest exceeding six per centum per annum, 
exclusive of amortization payments.” 
The effect of a good credit system is to encourage landowner- 
ship on the part of farmers. Much has been said of the in- 
spiration which ownership of land gives to the farmer which 
leads to better farming and better citizenship. Much might 
be said of the greater joy of life on the owned farm where the 
home can be beautified with assurance that the worker may 
reap the reward of his efforts. 
On the other hand, better credit usually means greater in- 
debtedness. In a period of rising prices when the value of the 
farm is rising while the debt is being paid with money which 
is ever more easily secured, indebtedness has few horrors. But 
in a period of falling prices when the value of the land falls as 
rapidly as the debt is paid, and when the dollars are ever harder 
to get, the joy of ownership becomes entirely overshadowed by 
the fear of foreclosure. To insure that a credit system shall 
be a blessing it may be desirable to introduce some plan which 
will stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar. 
Another bad effect which has been claimed against the credit 
system which lowers the interest rate is that it increases the 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
  FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 185 
value of the land and in this way makes it necessary for the 
prospective buyer to pay the same amount of interest and a 
larger principal. The effect of better credit, in this regard, 
depends upon the source of the funds. If, for example, the 
federal farm loan bonds are sold in New York City and the 
money borrowed by Iowa farmers, the effect might be to force 
the price of land up. On the other hand, if the bonds were 
marketed in the same region where the money is borrowed, 
the effect might be very different. Many farmers in Iowa buy 
more land than they care to farm because they have no other 
safe investment available. When federal farm loan bonds can 
be bought at the country banks in Iowa many farmers who are 
now paying high prices for land just as a safe investment and 
many retired farmers who hesitate to sell their farms for lack 
of a safe investment will prefer bonds to land. The result will 
be that many of the strongest bidders for land will cease to buy 
and many holders of land will decide to sell. This will tend to 
increase the number of farms for sale and decrease the demand 
from one class of buyers at the time when an increasing number 
of young farmers are buying because of the better credit system. 
What the result of these varied forces will be is hard to predict, 
but where the whole system is handled in a satisfactory manner 
both landlord and tenant may be benefited by encouraging 
ownership in place of tenancy. 
Interest is paid for the use of borrowed money. This money 
may be borrowed to invest in land or equipments, to pay labor, 
or to buy the necessities of life. In ancient times money was 
borrowed primarily to buy subsistence. At that time the 
charging of interest was looked upon as wrong, just as we would 
look upon it as wrong for a farmer to refuse to lend his ax for 
half a day free of charge to the son of a poor widow, in order 
that he may cut some stovewood for his mother. The charging 
of any interest was once called usury. Now only the charging 
of an excessive rate is called usury. This change of attitude 
is due to the fact that in modern life loans are usually made 
for productive purposes. 
While interest is nominally paid for the use of money, it is
-P-A-G-E-198
  
  186 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the equipments the farmer buys with the money he is really 
securing the use of. It is the equipment which is productive. 
That is, the farmer working with teams, tools, and machinery 
can usually produce more than working without them. Where 
this is true he is willing to pay for the use of these equipments. 
Furthermore, if he has not the means of acquiring the equip- 
ments when needed he is willing to pay a premium to have them 
now rather than wait for them until he can earn the money with 
which to buy them. This premium takes the form of interest 
paid for the use of borrowed money. How much the borrower 
is willing to pay for the advances of funds depends upon what 
he hopes to gain by their use. This varies greatly with dif- 
ferent people and with different investments for the same 
people. Ata given time the demand for loanable funds will 
depend upon the number of fine prospects for investments and 
upon the interest rate. 
Why do the lenders of money insist on charging interest? 
Some of these money lenders are unable to direct productive 
agencies. Widows and orphans are often given as examples of 
this class. There are others who have more than they can 
manage to very great advantage and who will lend the money 
to some one else if the interest rate is better than the rate of 
return this potential lender can make on this fund when used 
by himself. The choice between lending and not lending is 
not always a choice between two classes of investments; it may bea 
choice between saving and spending. The higher the interest 
rate the borrowers are willing to pay, the more inducement 
there is to refrain from present consumption in order to have 
money to invest. Some economists attempt to measure 
interest in terms of the premium which people place upon 
present consumption over future consumption. Familiarity 
with the law of diminishing utility leads one to believe 
that after an individual has satisfied present wants to a 
certain point, future wants seem more important than the 
unsatisfied present wants. The degree of civilization possessed 
will determine where this point will be found. There are al- 
ways people who will save whether or not they receive a pre-

mium in the form of interest for doing so. There are others who 
would not save even if the rate of interest were very high. 
With people as they are at a given time, the amount of saving 
will depend upon the extent to which the present wants seem 
more important than future wants and by the premium offered 
in the form of interest to counterbalance this greater present 
importance. 
It has been shown why funds are useful and why they are 
scarce. Hence a market value is placed upon their use; this 
market value expressed in terms of money is the interest charge. 
The rate of interest at any given time is determined by the 
opportunities for productive enterprises and the number and 
energy of the men who want funds for this and other purposes, 
that is, the intensity of the demand for funds, the abundance 
of funds, and the relative importance of present and future 
wants in the minds of potential lenders. In other words, 
price-determining forces work here as elsewhere. 
Why is the rate of interest different at different places at the 
same time, and with different people at the same time and place? 
That is, why is the rate of interest not uniform at all places 
and on all loans? 
Unevenness of demand. Where there is a continuous use 
for funds the rate will tend to be lower than where there is a 
large demand for certain seasons of the year and a small demand 
other seasons. If funds must lie idle half of the year awaiting 
a seasonal demand, a high rate must be charged for the time 
the money is lent in order to make up a normal average rate, 
or else funds must be imported, at some expense, for the de- 
mand period and sent elsewhere for investment the remainder 
of the year. 
Immobility of funds. One reason for different rates at dif- 
ferent places is because some money lenders do not know so 
much about the character of the investments at a distance and 
prefer to have their funds close at home. Others are willing to 
lend money at a distance but find that it costs more to ascer- 
tain the character of the loan, hence they must have a higher 
rate, and, again, when the financial institutions intervene to

adjust the supply of funds this costs something which must be 
added to the interest rate. The interest rate tends, therefore, 
to be lower in a region where there is a surplus of savings than 
in a region where there is not enough local saving to care for 
the needs of investors. 
Risk. The fact that some loans are safer than others is 
legitimate ground for differences in the interest rates. If there 
is any chance of losing the principal, a certain amount of in- 
surance is added to the interest rate to compensate the money 
lender for taking this risk. It often happens that lack of knowl- 
edge on the part of the lender makes him assume the risk is 
great where it is really small. Credit associations, made up of 
farmers who know each other, can reduce greatly the amount 
of risk by eliminating the dangerous loans, and by carrying for 
themselves the risk which would otherwise fall upon the money 
lender. This is one reason the credit association can borrow 
at a lower rate than can the individual members of the asso- 
ciation. 
Interest and the purchase price. It frequently happens 
that the rate of interest upon deferred payments is fixed as 
a part of the bargain in the sale of a farm. For example, a 
retired farmer sold his farm and took a mortgage for $12,000 
at four and one-half per cent annual interest. When asked by 
the writer why he made the interest rate so low, the reply was, 
“ Well, I was getting a long price for the farm.” Often the 
buyer who may have been in the habit of paying rent, thinks 
especially of the amount he will have to pay in interest each 
year. A desire to keep this amount low may result in paying 
too high a price for the farm if he is favored by a low interest 
rate. The purchaser should keep both sale price and interest 
rate in mind when making the bargain. Otherwise what seems 
to be a low rate of interest may be a very high one. 
Terms of payment. The purchaser may better afford to 
pay a somewhat higher rate of interest if he has the privilege 
of making partial payments whenever he has some money, 
rather than to borrow at a lower rate for a long period, say five 
years, with no chance to make payments until the note is due. 
   
-P-A-G-E-201
  FARM CREDIT AND THE RATE OF INTEREST 189 
If one gradually saves the whole amount during the five years 
and deposits in a savings bank at a rate two per cent less than he 
is paying, the loss may be equivalent to one per cent on the face 
of the loan for the whole time. Where the borrower can secure 
a part of the funds needed at a low rate and a part at a higher 
rate with privilege of paying whenever he has an even hundred 
dollars, he will be in a position to benefit by both of these 
systems. _

  CHAPTER XVII 
RENTS AND PROFITS 
In this chapter the effort will be to describe the economic 
forces which determine the amount paid for the annual use of 
land. This is important from the point of view of one making 
a rent contract, and it is important from the point of view of 
the improvement of the well-being of the succeeding genera- 
tions of land workers. 
The important economic questions regarding rent relate to 
the causes which determine the amount of rent paid at a given 
time for a given farm, the difference in the amounts of rent paid 
for different farms at the same time, and the changes in the 
amounts of rent on a given farm during a period of years. Rent 
is paid for only such farms as are useful and scarce. Useful 
farms with improvements may be scarce while raw land of the 
same quality is abundant, in which case a price may be paid 
for the improvements and not for the land. In any densely 
populated country, however, highly productive land is scarce 
and people are willing to pay for the privilege of using it. 
The supply of farm land may be increased by settling unoc- 
cupied prairie regions, clearing forest lands, draining marshes, 
irrigating arid regions, etc., but it is generally true that the land 
to be secured in these ways is less inviting to the farmers in 
competition for the use of land, either because of the large in, 
“ vestments required to bring the land into cultivation, which 
reduces greatly the return per unit of investment in the land, 
or because of lack of fertility or desirable location. For these 
reasons it has been common to think of the new increments of 
land supply as having a lower degree of economic productivity 
per unit of investment, that is, lower efficiency, than the land 
already in use. On this assumption Ricardo based his theory 
190
-P-A-G-E-203
  
  "RENTS AND PROFITS I9l 
that with the increase of population rents would tend to rise. 
Exceptions to this general truth arise when new and fertile 
regions are made easily accessible by the extension of railways, 
by Indian treaties, or other means of like character. When the 
agricultural population is increasing and the increased supply 
of land must be taken from the less efficient grades, the trend of 
rent is upwards. When new and more efficient grades of land 
are made available more rapidly than the population increases, 
the trend is downward. Thus rents may rise or fall according 
to the relative demand for its use. By the middle of the nine- 
teenth century the westward movement of population in the 
United States had reached the prairies of the Central States, 
where the cost of bringing land into cultivation was at a mini- 
mum and the natural fertility of the land was at a maximum. 
With the expansion of the corn area the movement was first 
from poor corn land to good, then from good to excellent, but 
with the further expansion, less and less satisfactory corn land 
was resorted to and it was only in this latter stage that rents 
began rapidly to rise. This was partially true of wheat though 
it is a question whether any wheat lands in the United States 
have ever surpassed the best wheat regions of New York and 
Pennsylvania. The significant fact was the great abundance of 
good wheat land, which resulted in the decline of wheat prices 
and a decline in the value of wheat lands in the older wheat 
regions. The westward movement brought better lands into 
cultivation. These better lands, for example, the black prairie 
of Alabama, the alluvial soils of the Mississippi, and the black 
prairie of Texas, were selected spots surrounded by wide 
areas of less useful lands which were passed by to take the better 
lands. The general effect was to reduce prices and rents for 
the time. As better and better corn, wheat, and cotton lands 
were taken up, price levels were on the decline, and many 
farmers in the older regions suffered a decrement instead of 
getting the expected unearned increment in land values. But 
with the growth of population the increased demand for land 
results in keen competition for the better farms, which brings 
about rising rents. 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  192 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The motives that underlie the actions of men when bidding 
for the use of land are fundamentally the same as those that 
operate in determining the values of other useful things. The 
theory of rent is therefore an attempt to indicate the way in 
which the theory of value works itself out when applied to the 
annual value of land. 
While all land that is useful and scarce is valuable, all such 
land is not equally valuable, for the simple reason that all land 
is not equally useful. This variation in usefulness may be due 
to variations in the fertility of the land or to differences in the 
location of the land with respect to the market for the goods 
produced. Economists have usually thought of the least 
desirable land in use at a given time as being rent free. That 
is, it is assumed that the least desirable land will be in great 
abundance in proportion to the demand for such land, and, 
therefore, that no rent will be paid for its use. This “ no- 
rent ” land is then taken as the starting point for measuring 
the rent of the more useful grades of land. According to the 
Ricardian Theory, the rent of any given grade of land is meas- 
ured by the difference in the value of the produce resulting from 
a given outlay of labor and capital on that land, and on the no- 
rent land. For example, suppose a farmer can, with the same 
effort and expenditure, produce goods as shown in Table XI.

The assumption is that, if all these grades of land, and no 
more, are needed to supply the market, competition will tend 
- to make the rent of the requisite quantity of fifth-grade land 
$100, that of fourth-grade $200, that of third-grade $300, that 
.. ! David Ricardo, “Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,” Chapter II. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  RENTS AND PROFITS 193 
of second-grade $400, and that of the first grade $500. This 
is said to be true because it is assumed that the farmer can as 
well afford to pay these sums as use the no-rent land. This 
theory ignores the variation in the efficiency of the factors 
other than land, and, while it shows the differential character 
of rent, which was the point Ricardo was emphasizing, it cannot 
be regarded as a measure of rent. 
Many economists have ignored variations in the efficiency 
of farmers, manufacturers, and men of commerce, but others, 
following Walker,’ adhere to a theory of profits analogous 
to the Ricardian theory of rent. They believe that all farmers 
are not equally efficient, and that the farmers who, because of 
their better judgment and greater skill, manage their farm opera- 
tions better than their competitors, are able to secure larger 
returns from the same expenditures for labor and equipment 
on the same grade of land. These economists would assume the 
returns given for the various grades of land in the above illustra- 
tions to be the product of the least capable farmer needed to 
supply the demand for agricultural products, and that the farmer 
whose ability is superior to that of the least capable farmer will 
be in a position to secure a profit. The profit of a given farmer 
will be measured, it is said, by: the difference in the value of 
the product that he can secure and the value of the product 
secured by the least capable farmer, with a given outlay on 
a given grade of land. For example, suppose that with a given 
outlay on no-rent land (that is, on the least useful land needed 
to supply the demand for agricultural products) the value of the 
product secured by the different grades of farmers is as follows:

The assumption is that, if the produce of all these grades of 
farmers, and no more, is in demand, Farmer F will just be able 
to pay expenses, including a living for himself and his family, 
but Farmer E can retain a profit of $100, D $200, C $300, 
B $400, and A $500, because the more efficient farmers secure 
larger returns in value, as a result of the same outlay, than 
does the marginal farmer. This larger return may be due to 
the ability of a more efficient farmer to secure more produce of 
the same quality, or to produce a better quality of products, 
or at the same time to produce more and of a better quality. 
The influence of variations in efficiency on rents and profits. 
These theories of rent and profits point in the direction of the 
truth but fall short of an accurate statement because they leave 
out of account at least three important considerations, namely, 
(x) the influence of variation in the efficiency of farmers on the 
amount of competitive rent; (2) the influence of variations in 
usefulness of land on the amount of profits; and (3) the in- 
fluence of the variation of the usefulness of equipments and of 
hired laborers on rents and profits. Each of these points may, 
to advantage, receive our attention. 
To illustrate the way these forces will tend to determine the 
amount of rent and profits, let the figures in the following table 
represent the value of the gross product that the farmers of the 
respective grades can produce as a result of an outlay of five 
hundred dollars for labor and for the use of equipments, our 
fixed unit of expenditure on the different grades of land. It 
will be assumed, in this illustration, that the more efficient 
farmers always invest the given outlay in the more productive 
forms of labor and equipments. In order to make this and the 
foregoing illustrations include the element of variation in in- 
tensity of culture, we have taken a fixed outlay for labor and 
for the use of equipments, instead of a fixed area of land. If, 
therefore, 100 acres be the area of sixth-grade land on which this 
expenditure is made, less than too acres of the more useful 
grades are likely to be cultivated with this same outlay, for it 
is usually true that the more useful the land, the more intensive 
the culture that is most profitable.

Note that in Table XIII the figures representing the product 
of the F-grade farmer on the different grades of land are the 
same as in Table XI, where the Ricardian theory of rent was 
illustrated. Note also that the figures representing the prod- 
uct of the various grades of farmers on sixth-grade land are 
the same as those used in Table XII, where Walker’s theory of 
profits is illustrated. And note further that the remainder of 
this. table is the result of simply following out logically the as- 
sumption in the two preceding tables. That is, in this table, 
instead of stopping with a statement of the variations in the 
product of the different grades of land when farmed by the 
F-grade farmer, and a statement of the variation of the product 
of the different grades of farmers on the sixth-grade land, we 
here give a statement of the product which each grade of farmers 
produce upon each grade of land, also the rent and the profits 
which would be approximated, in the case of free competition 
among the different grades of farmers for the various grades of 
land. 
It is here assumed that the F-grade farmer, when operating 
sixth-grade land and a corresponding grade of labor and equip- 
ment, will just be able to make a living without paying any 
rent for the use of the land. In other words, we have here a 
no-profit farmer operating no-rent land. On a basis of the 
figures in Table XIII, the F-grade farmer can afford to pay $100 
as rent for the quantity of fifth-grade land on which he would 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
make the same outlay as on 100 acres of sixth-grade land, for, 
instead of a product worth $500, he would there be able to 
secure a product worth $600. Following the same reasoning, 
the F-grade farmer could afford to pay $200 for the fourth- 
grade land, $300 for the third-grade land, $400 for the second- 
grade land, and $500 for the first-grade land. 
When all the grades of land are viewed from the standpoint 
of the A-grade farmer, it becomes apparent that he can make a 
profit on land of any of these grades, and that he would do as 
well to pay a rent of $200 for the use of the fifth-grade land, 
$400 for the use of the fourth-grade land, $600 for the third, 
$800 for the second, and $1000 for the use of the first-grade 
land, as to farm the sixth-grade land rent free. But is therea 
competitor who will make the A-grade farmer pay the price? 
This we must ascertain by studying the interests of the competi- 
tors. 
The E-grade farmer is able to produce $600 worth of products 
on the sixth-grade land, leaving him a profit of $100. It can- 
not be expected that he will be willing to accept less profit 
from land of any other grade. He can pay $120 as rent for the 
amount of fifth-grade land on which the same outlay is made 
as on the 100 acres of sixth-grade land, and retain the same 
profits, $720—($500+$100) =$120. But the F-grade farmer 
can bid no more than $100 for the use of the fifth-grade land, 
and, so far as he is concerned, the E-grade farmer can have the 
fifth-grade land for anything over $100, and can give a balance 
to turn the bargain. Let us, in this illustration, figure that 
he will pay $105. This will leave him a profit of $115; 
$720—($500+$105) =$115. In bidding for the fourth-grade 
land, he could not be expected to accept a smaller profit. His 
gross income on fourth-grade land is $840. This, minus the 
$500 outlay and the $115 profit that he could make on fifth- 
grade land, leaves $225 as the maximum rent that the E-grade 
farmer can bid for the fourth-grade land. 
When the rent of fifth-grade land is $105, the D-grade farmer 
can secure a profit of $235 on that grade of land, 
$840—($500+$105) =$235. He could secure this same profit 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
    RENTS AND PROFITS 197 
on fourth-grade land and pay a rental of $245 for its use, 
$980 —($500+ $235) =$245. But so far as the competition 
of his inferiors is concerned, any amount over $225, let us 
say $230, is all the D-grade farmer need pay for fourth-grade 
land. This will leave him a profit of $250, $980 —($500+$230) 
= $250, which is $15 more than he could make on fifth-grade 
land at the rent the E-grade farmer is willing to pay. To 
secure the same profit on third-grade land the D-grade farmer 
cannot pay more than $370 for its use, $1120 —($500-+$250) = 
$370. But the C-grade farmer, whose profits on fourth-grade 
land at a rental of $230 would be $390, $1120 —($500+$230) = 
$390, can secure the same profit from third-grade land after 
paying $390 as rent, $1280—($500+$390) =$390. It will 
be profitable, therefore, for C-grade farmer to outbid the D- 
grade farmer for the use of the third-grade land by paying $375, 
for this will leave him a profit of $405; $1280—($500+$375) = 
$405. To secure the same profit on second-grade land, the 
C-grade farmer can bid no more than $535 for its use, $1440— 
($500+$405) =$535. But the B-grade farmer whose profit 
on third-grade land at a rental of $375 would be $565, $1440— 
($500+$375) =$565, can secure the same profit from second- 
grade land after paying a rental of $565 as rent, $1620— 
($500+$565) =$555. It will be profitable for him, therefore, 
to outbid the C-grade farmer for second-grade land by paying 
$540. This will leave him a profit of $580; $1620—($500 
+$540) =$580. The B-grade farmer could pay no more than 
$720 for the use of the first-grade land and retain this same net 
profit, $1800 —($500+$580) =$720; but the A-grade farmer 
can pay any amount up to $740 for first-grade land rather than 
take second-grade land at $540; for his profit on second-grade 
land would be $760; $1800 —($500-+$540) =$760, and $2000 — 
($500+$760) =$740. As $720 is the most any other competi- 
tor can pay for the use of first-grade land, the A-grade farmer 
can secure this grade of land for a fraction over that amount, 
let us say, $725, and retain a profit of $775. 
It is a matter of common observation that competition tends 
to distribute the farmers on the different grades of land in ac-  
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
cordance with their efficiency, the A-grade farmer on the first- 
grade land, the B-grade farmer on the second-grade land, and 
soon. The fact that each grade of farmers can win a larger 
profit on the grade of land that corresponds to his degree of 
efficiency is the force that tends to bring about this condition of 
affairs. But it is not the individual farmers alone who are 
benefited as the result of the working out of this tendency. 
The combination of the productive forces that puts the most 
useful agents of production into the hands of the most efficient 
farmers results in the largest total production of economic 
goods for the country as a whole. 
These points may be illustrated by use of Table XIII. Let 
the student calculate the profits that each farmer could make 
on the various grades of land and it will become more clear that 
competition makes the rents of the various grades of land such 
that the farmer’s profit is the greatest on the land to which his 
grade of efficiency adapts him. Again, let the student cal- 
culate the total value of the product of all grades of land when 
the A-grade farmer is on the first-grade land, the B-grade 
farmer on the second-grade land,.and on down the list. 
($2000+$1620+$1280+ $980+$720+$500=$7100); then let 
him try any other combination, and it will be found that no 
other combination of the grades of farmers and land will result 
in so large a total product. 
In actual practice it is evident that custom, sentiment, and 
lack of knowledge retard the operations of the economic forces 
to the detriment of individual and national well-being. Yet 
the fact has long been recognized that the farmers who are the 
most efficient do actually tend to get the best grades of land 
and equipment. 
This analysis of the forces of distribution forms the basis for 
drawing some significant conclusions. First: It makes a dif- 
ference which grade of land the farmer chooses. The farmer who 
is the most efficient can secure the highest profits from the land 
that is most useful for his lines of production. This is likewise 
true of the labor and equipment employed by him. Second: 
All farmers of superior ability may save from their profits and 
   
-P-A-G-E-211
  
RENTS AND PROFITS 199 
thus get ahead in the world, i.e. “the iron law of wages” operates 
only for the marginal farmer. Third: the farmer can make use 
of the highest degree of skill and knowledge without fear that the 
landlord will be able to take, in the form of a higher rent, all of 
the extra product due to more efficient management. 
Thus far rent and profits have been considered at a given time 
with a given supply of land, equipments, laborers, and farmers, 
and a given market condition. It is well recognized that with 
the passing of time, the relative abundance of the factors of 
production changes, market conditions change, and the degree 
of skill and knowledge changes, resulting in changes in the 
amount of rent paid for a given piece of land. 
With the growth of population a double effect on rent tends 
to follow: First, increased demands for produce increase the 
price of the products so that the rent measured in terms of money 
will rise even though the share of the product going to land 
remains the same. Then again the growth of population and 
the resulting increase in competition for the use of the land 
tends to make people willing to take up land formerly considered 
too poor to make it worth while to cultivate it, but before 
taking this inferior land they will bid higher for the land 
already in cultivation and this will result in an increase in 
the proportion of the product paid for the use of land. On 
the other hand, improvements in the means of transportation 
which will result in an increase in the supply of good farm 
land more rapidly than the farm workers increase will tend to 
reduce the share of the product paid for the use of the land. 
This was true during the period following the extension of rail- 
_ ways into the prairies of the North Central States. The general 
principle is that with changes in the relative abundance of land, 
labor, and capital, the most slowly increasing factor is in a posi- 
tion under conditions of free competition to command an in- 
creasing proportion of the product. 
The withdrawal of large numbers of farm workers from 
agriculture in case of great national emergencies like the world 
war will tend to increase the proportion going to the human 
factor and reduce the proportion if not the amount of rent. 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
On the other hand, the call ‘of patriotism and high prices may 
stimulate men to utilize more completely their maximum po- 
tential capacity for farm work. This will tend to overcome the 
tendency for rents to fall, for increasing the capacity of men 
means that each man will demand more land, which will in 
turn tend to increase rent or at least retard its fall. 
The increase in the efficiency of men, which results in more 
produce from the same amount of land and labor, will, other 
things being the same, tend to reduce rents for, with the demand 
for produce remaining the same, increased supply will tend to 
lower the prices of produce. While this would be the first 
effect, lower prices would tend to stimulate population and in 
the long run increased efficiency will enable a growing popula- 
tion to encroach farther and farther down the scale to less and 
less productive land and bid higher and higher for the good 
land, driving rents higher than they could have been without 
the increased human efficiency. 
The accumulation of capital may result in the increase of rents, 
and the reduction in the supply of capital available for agricul- 
ture may reduce rents. The growth of the capital supply 
normally tends to reduce the rate of interest, and the price of 
equipments, and for these two reasons stimulate the buying 
of farm equipments, which not only tends to increase the total 
product of the land but to give a larger proportion of the 
produce to the owner. 
Any improvement in the type of farming in a given locality 
which will give more nearly continuous profitable employment 
throughout the year, either by using more land or by providing 
more profitable labor on a given piece of land, will tend to give 
an increased proportion of the produce to the owner of the 
land. 
Tnus while it is true that differences exist among men 
as well as among the different grades of land, which give basis 
for a special differential return in the form of profits to men, 
it is true also that competition may result in the decrease of 
one of these surpluses to the advantage of the other. If farmers 
and workmen and equipments increase more rapidly than land 
 
-P-A-G-E-213

of the quality in use, competitive forces tend to increase rent 
at the expense of the return to the other factors. 
Figure ro is intended to illustrate the distribution of the 
gross returns of the agricultural industry, among the factors of 
production. This illustration is based upon Table XIII and it 
is assumed that the factors will be brought together in the most 
productive manner, that is, with the most efficient farmers 
operating the most efficient forms of equipments upon the most 
efficient land, and that these factors are associated in the proper

proportion. Under these conditions the composite units which 
are made up of the most productive grades of the factors will 
yield a relatively larger product, in proportion to their pro- 
ductivity, even, than the units made up of the less productive 
grades of the factors, and hence, in the higher grades each factor 
will receive the necessary minimum and a further differential 
due to superior efficiency and to the codperation of the more 
productive grades of the factors. 
When the subject of distribution is viewed from the stand- 
point of industrial progress, through a long period of years,
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the most important fact to be considered is that the other fac- 
tors usually increase more rapidly than does land. As the 
farmers and the equipments continue to increase more rapidly 
than the land, some of the better grades of these more rapidly 
increasing factors are crowded down farther and farther upon 
the less and less productive land. This necessarily results 
in the driving out of business of some of the lower grades of 
farmers and equipments, leaving upon the margin higher 
grades of these factors, which will be able to earn their necessary 
minimum upon lower grades of land, and hence the margin of 
cultivation may be driven down to less productive land by the 
competition of the increasing numbers of farmers and the in- 
creasing supplies of equipments. The resulting change in the 
distribution of the gross product among the factors is illustrated 
by the dotted lines in Fig. 10, where it will be noted that the rent 
rises as a result of a fall in the returns to the other factors of 
production. 
It is possible for the rent to rise, however, without any 
absolute decline in the returns to the other factors. Changes 
in the prices of agricultural products will greatly influence the 
share which will be accounted to land. When, as a result of 
increased demand for food and clothing, the prices of agri- 
cultural products rise, the share of the returns of a given farm 
which may be credited to land increases. When, for any reason, 
such as the opening of vast areas of very productive land, the 
prices of agricultural products fall, the share of the gross re- 
turns which can be paid for the use of land will, other things 
remaining the same, necessarily fall, and the movement will 
tend to be the reverse of that shown in Fig. 10. 
The laws of value and price hold true with respect to the 
price which is paid for the use of land and equipments; but 
as we have seen, the conditions of supply and demand are very 
complex, and the difficult problems in distribution arise out of 
the fact that costs and prices do not correspond except on the 
margin where the least productive of all of the factors are 
brought together, and that there are large surpluses over 
costs, to be divided. It was one time thought that all of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
    RENTS AND PROFITS 203, 
surplus should be attributed to land; but in recent years econo- 
mists have come to see that each of the factors is in a position to 
command a share of the surplus, that the share secured by each 
is worked out through supply and demand, and that the most 
slowly increasing factor tends to receive a larger and larger 
proportion of the surplus. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 
Ir is easy to say that the price of land, like the price of any 
other economic good, is determined by the forces and conditions 
which regulate the demand and the supply; but this is too 
general to be of any help to the farmer who is trying to esti- 
mate the value of a particular piece of land. 
The net rent, or the share of the gross returns which, under 
conditions of free competition, is credited to land, above what 
is necessary to keep the land intact, is the starting point for 
figuring the value of a piece of land. When a man invests in 
land, the thing for which he really pays is the perpetual right 
to use the land and to be free from the payment of rent, or to 
receive the income which the land will yield if leased to some one 
else. 
The essential difference between the buying of a piece of 
land and the buying of a perpetual annuity bond lies in the fact 
that while the income from the latter is fixed in terms of a money 
income, the former may rise or fall as a result of changes in 
the conditions of competition for the use of land, or from changes 
in the value of the unit of the standard of value. 
Let it be assumed that the net rent of a given acre of land is 
six dollars. On the further assumption that this amount will 
not change, we may think of this acre of land as a perpetual 
bearer of an annual income of six dollars. Six dollars this year, 
six dollars next year, and the next, and so on so long as time 
shalllast. The total amount of rent which may be received from 
this land is incalculable. If there is no limit to the number 
of years during which rent may be received for the use of this 
land, then the amount of rent to be received may become in- 
finitely great, and if one were required to pay down the full 
204
-P-A-G-E-217
    THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 205 
amount of all these possible rents, which the future years may 
possibly yield, the price of land would be such that no man could 
purchase it. 
As a matter of fact, however, the present market value of 
the perpetual rent bearer is often not more than twenty times 
the net rent, and it is seldom more than thirty times the rent. 
This is explained by the fact that present wants are estimated 
more highly than future wants, which leads to the discounting 
of future incomes! “at a rate that reflects the prevailing 
premium on the present.” The rent which will be due one year 
from date is discounted at this prevailing rate, and so it is for 
all the succeeding rents. The present values of the succeeding 
future rents grow smaller and smaller as the time one must wait 
for them becomes greater and greater, until finally the rent 
which is due at the end of an infinite period of time would be 
infinitesimal. 
When the rate of discount is five per cent, for example, the 
present valuation of a six-dollar rent which will be due in ten 
years is approximately three dollars and sixty-eight cents; 
the six-dollar rent which is due after twenty years has a present 
valuation of about two dollars and twenty-four cents; and the 
six-dollar rent which is due in forty years has a present value 
of about eighty-four cents. If this process of discounting future 
rents be carried far enough, the point would finally be reached 
where the present value of the future rent is too small to be 
taken into account. The present value of the rent which is 
due after an infinite number of years is infinitesimal. If the 
present values of all these future rents be added together, the 
sum would be the present capital value of the land, or the amount 
of capital which, if lent at a rate of five per cent per annum, 
would yield the same income as the land is yielding at the present 
time. ; 
The simple mathematical method of finding this “sum 
is to divide the annual value, that is, the net rent, by the rate 
which “ reflects the prevailing premium on the present.” If “ ”

206 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the net annual income derived from a piece of land is six dollars 
per acre, and the rate of discount is five per cent, the present 
capital value of the land would be one hundred and twenty 
dollars per acre. One hundred and twenty dollars is, then, 
the amount of money which, if lent at five per cent, would 
yield an annual net income of six dollars. This is usually spoken 
of as the capital value of the land. 
That this simple method of dividing the six-dollar net rent 
by the prevailing rate of discount to find the capital value of a 
piece of land is equivalent to finding the sum of an infinite 
series of prospective net annual three-dollar rents discounted 
at the same rate may be demonstrated as follows :

the value: V= : which is the ordinary method of capitalizing 
rent. 
As a matter of fact, however, the present capital value of the 
land as determined in this way does not often correspond with 
the price which is paid for land. There are several important 
reasons for this difference. First it is not certain that the annual 
income that can be drawn from one hundred and twenty dollars 
will always be six dollars. The rate of interest may fall to four 
   
-P-A-G-E-219
    THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 207 
per cent, which would reduce the income to be derived from that 
amount of money to four dollars and eighty cents, while the 
annual income from the land would not be reduced by a lower- 
ing of the current rate of interest. The belief that there is a 
greater probability of a decline in the income to be derived 
from the money than from the land, often makes men willing 
to pay more for land than the amount of capital which will 
now yield the same income. 
Another reason which leads men to pay more for land than 
a money loan which will, at the present time, yield the same 
income, is the belief that with the progress of society the compe- 
tition for the use of land will result in a rise in rents, that, 
while there is a tendency for the annual income which can be 
derived by lending a given amount of money to decline, there 
is at the same time and under like conditions a tendency for 
the income of a given amount of land to increase. 
The available land supply of a country usually increases 
less rapidly than the population, so that it becomes necessary 
to resort to land which is either less fertile, less favorably 
situated, or more difficult to bring under cultivation; and as 
a result of keener competition for the better grades of land the 
amount which will be offered for the use of such land will rise. 
While this is what usually happens in the long run, it sometimes 
happens that the discovery of great quantities of very fertile 
land, and the invention of better means of transportation mak- 
ing this new land more accessible, will for a time reduce the 
competition for the land which was already under cultivation, 
and the rent of such land may, for a time, be reduced; but it is 
believed that the occasional reactions of this kind cannot per- 
manently counteract the tendency for the price of land to rise. 
The land which yields the highest rent at one time may be 
surpassed in the amount of rent which it will yield at another 
time, by land which was formerly let for a smaller rent. This 
may be the result (1) of the introduction of a new crop which 
thrives best on the land which for other purposes was counted 
inferior; (2) it may be the result of a dense population in a 
region which had formerly been sparsely populated, in other  
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
words, the development of a better home market; (3) it may 
be the result of an improvement in the means of communica- 
tion which makes the land which was formerly more fertile 
but less accessible, equally accessible, and hence, more valu- 
able; or (4) it may be the result of a rise in the prices of agri- 
cultural produce, or a fall in the current rate of interest, either - 
of which would result in a more rapid increase in the value of 
land which is more fertile and accessible, but which requires 
relatively larger expenditures to bring it into cultivation, 
than in the value of land which is less fertile or accessible but 
much more easily brought into cultivation. All of these pos- 
sible variations in the annual value of land must be properly 
anticipated and included in the list of future incomes which 
are discounted to find their present values. 
Perhaps enough has been said to impress the thoughtful 
reader with the fact that to determine the value of a piece of 
land is by no means a simple matter. When a man sells a 
piece of land he transfers his right to a series of annual incomes 
which may be greater or less as time passes by, but which will 
probably increase as the years go by. In payment for this 
land he is to accept another income-bearer which may yield a 
larger or smaller annual income as the years go by, but which 
will probably yield a smaller income in the future than at 
present. This circumstance makes it impossible to do more 
than approximate the actual present value of a piece of land. 
The presence of so many uncertainties makes the buying of 
land partake more or less of the character of speculation, and 
during times of prosperity the tendency is for men to be optimis- 
tic and overestimate the probabilities of a rise in rents or 
a fall in the rate of interest. On the other hand, when periods 
of depression come, the tendency is for men to underestimate 
the future possibilities. As a result of this psychological ele- 
ment, the tendency is for the price of land to rise too high dur- 
ing periods of prosperity and to sink too low during periods of 
depression. As many years are usually required for one of 
these changes from undervaluation to overvaluation to take 
place, land does not lend itself so readily to speculation as does 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
       THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 209 
wheat, for example; and yet the man with plenty of funds which 
are available at the right time may win large profits from specula- 
tions in land. Speculation if indulged in at the proper time 
may keep the price of land from falling so low as it might other- 
wise do in times of depression, and also from rising so high as it 
otherwise might during times of inflated values. This is true 
only where the speculator is wise enough to buy when prices 
are too low and to sell when the values rise too high. Unwise 
speculation in land may have the very opposite result. 
The study of the rise and fall of the price of land in the United 
States seems to show that there are times when the price rises 
rapidly for a few years and then remains stationary for several 
years. This latter period is usually characterized by the fact 
that sales of land are relatively few. Land is generally held at 
the prices which were reached during the period of rapid sales, 
when optimistic views of the future forced the price considerably 
beyond the present capital value. If sales are made during this 
dull period they are likely to be at a price appreciably lower 
than that at which land is usually held, and likely to be a forced 
sale. The price of land, then, may be illustrated by a curve 
which rises during one period, remains on the same level or 
falls during a succeeding period, and then rises again. When 
viewed for a long period of time, the general rise in land values 
is evident, but the temporary fluctuations are very important 
to any one interested in buying land. 
The price of land in any given district is influenced by the 
number and character of the men who desire to be farmers in 
that district. It often happens that competition for the use of 
land is keener in some regions than in others, even though the 
land be as fertile, and the prices of agricultural products as 
high, in the one place as in the other. Some districts produce 
more high-grade farmers each generation than do other districts, 
and as a strong motive is required to impel the surplus of 
farmers to remove to another district, competition in the over- 
populated district forces the rents and the prices which are paid 
for land higher and higher until they are appreciably above the 
level of those which are paid for land in other districts which 
P  
-P-A-G-E-222
   
  210 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
are capable of producing crops which are just as valuable in 
terms of money. 
Again, it sometimes happens that land is valued for the social 
standing which accompanies its ownership, as well as for the 
income in money which it yields. In a country where this is 
true, and where, at the same time, there are large numbers of 
persons who have great fortunes and who are very desirous of 
attaining to a high social position, the prices which may be 
paid for land often rise far beyond what could be paid if the 
series of annual incomes in cash were the only factor to be taken 
into account. 
Of two pieces of land which will rent for the same amount, 
that in one district may sell for a higher price than that in an- 
other because there is more money seeking investment in the 
one place than in the other. A man of wealth will usually 
rather have his capital invested in land near where he lives than 
at a great distance where he cannot so readily look after his 
property, or if he invests in land at a greater distance he will 
usually expect a higher rate of return to counteract the disad- 
vantages arising from the distance. 
This same principle of capitalization may be applied to other 
forms of income bearers as well as to land. In estimating the 
value of a given machine, the farmer may think of the amount 
of service he is to get out of the machine during the next ten 
years, let us say, on the assumption that the machine will be 
worn out in that time. This is a rather difficult process be- 
cause the deterioration of the machine and perhaps, also, the 
invention of a better machine to do the same work will result 
in a gradual reduction in the usefulness of the machines; and 
yet, if he is to invest wisely in the various forms of equipment, 
the farmer should attempt to estimate the value of the series 
of uses which may reasonably be expected to be gotten from 
the particular instrument of production during the time which 
it shall be at all serviceable, and then find the present value 
of these future uses by discounting them “ at a rate that reflects 
the prevailing premium on the present.” 
This capital value of the instrument represents the maximum   
  
-P-A-G-E-223
    
THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 211 
price which the farmer can afford to pay, but does not, of course, 
necessarily represent the market price of the instrument of 
production. The market price may be greater or less than the 
capital value obtained in this way, for the instrument of pro- 
duction may have as many valuations as there are different 
grades of farmers to use it and different grades of uses to which 
it may be put by a given farmer. In order to get a capital 
value that will correspond more or less closely to the market 
value of the various forms of capital-goods it will be necessary, 
therefore, to arrive at the competitive price which will be paid 
for the use of a given equipment during the series of years of its 
usefulness, and then find the present value of the series of in- 
comes, in the same way as has been done in the case of land. 
But since it is not common in this country to let horses, tools, 
and machinery to farmers for a hire, this method of capitaliza- 
tion is less practical to the farmer when applied to equipments 
than when applied to land. 
The cost of producing the machine or the horse is an important 
element in determining the price which must be paid for it in 
order that it may be produced. On the other hand, the use- 
fulness of the machine or the horse to the farmer forms the 
basis for his estimating whether or not he can better afford 
to pay the market price or do without them. It may be true 
even that the capital value of the instrument, when calculated 
on the basis of its usefulness to a given farmer, may be greater 
than its market value and yet it might be unprofitable for the 
farmer to buy the particular horse or machine, because other 
means of securing the same end might prove more profitable. 
The theory of capitalization is especially useful in the con- 
sideration of the value of farm land because the value of a given 
piece of land has no particular relation to the cost of bringing 
such land under cultivation. The income received by the 
landlord is largely a surplus which is credited to land becaust 
it is scarce, rather than because it costs any definite amoune 
to improve the land. Land is also much more permanent in 
character than is equipment, and for this reason, also, it lends 
itself with more facility to the above method of capitalization. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  212 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The fear that the price of land has been rising too rapidly 
and that present prices are highly speculative is rapidly gaining 
in its hold upon the minds of farmers. It can be shown that a 
rise in the price of land has been warranted, but the present 
situation deserves careful consideration and conservative 
action. The young farmer had better continue as a tenant a 
while longer unless he has at least half the purchase price in 
addition to funds enough to equip and operate the farm. 
The price per acre of farm land in the United States doubled 
during the decade from 1900 to 1910. There is no record of 
an equally great rise in the price of farm land in any other period 
in the history of our country. From 1850 to 1860, after the 
mid-century gold discoveries, the price per acre of all farms 
increased 46.5 per cent; from 1860 to 1870, 11.8 per cent; 
1870 to 1880, 4.2 per cent; 1880 to 1890, 12 per cent; whereas 
the average price of farm} land in the United States fell 7.1 
per cent during the decade from 1890 to 1900, owing largely to 
the depression in the West. The unparalleled rise in the prices 
of farm lands in recent years calls for some explanation. Where 
the increase in the price of land is due to a rise in the returns 
from investments in land, this increase is normal and to be 
expected. On the other hand, to the extent that the price of 
land rises without a corresponding rise in the income from land 
or a general fall in interest rates, the farmer and the nation have 
something to fear. 
As farm land values should depend upon rents, so farm rents 
are dependent upon the prices of farm products. The value 
per acre of farm products increased 66.8 per cent during the 
same period that the price of land doubled. If rents increased 
in proportion to the prices of products, this would yet leave a 
third of the increase in the price to be explained in terms of 
other forces. 
An increase in the share of the proceeds of the farm secured 
by the landlord would normally result in a more rapid rise in the 
price of land than in the price of crops. There has been a rise 
in share rents in parts of the north central states. Some land 
which rented for a third came to rent for two-fifths. Some land 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
    THE VALUE OF FARM LAND AND EQUIPMENTS 213 
which rented for two-fifths is rented for one-half. Unfortu- 
nately, the census gives no measure of the increase in rents. 
The cash income from land may remain the same and a 
legitimate rise in the price of land result from a fall in the 
interest rate on safe loans. It is doubtful if this has been an 
important influence in the recent rising prices of land. 
Belief in future increase in the returns from land may be 
the occasion of a rise in prices beyond the amount on which 
the rent will at present pay interest. This is the speculative 
factor in the present price of land. Just what share of present 
prices are speculative no one can tell. Much which was specu- 
lative investment prior to war prices appears no longer to be 
speculative, because the return which goes to land as share 
rent pays a satisfactory rate of interest on the present price 
of the land. The danger is that the prices of products will 
fall and leave the land values on a speculative level again. 
The paying of a price for farm land beyond its worth as a 
basis of farming operations is not so serious a matter for the 
purchaser who is able to pay cash for the land. If he has paid 
too much and the price does not rise, or having risen falls again, 
he is poorer but not broken. With the man who buys on a 
land contract with only 20 per cent of the purchase money paid 
down, the case is different. In recent years many farms have 
been purchased at a high price and with only a small proportion 
of the purchase money paid down. The outcome has usually 
been good because of the ability of the purchasers and the trend 
of prices. If debt paying is favored by rising prices of farm 
products, most farmers will pull through safely, even when 
land prices are above the productive value of the land. In 
case of stationary prices, all have a hard time, but the more 
able will succeed in spite of the burden of excessive principal 
and interest. If an era of falling prices should follow, hope 
would soon be crushed and the failure of all but the very ablest 
would be all but certain. It is unwise for a farmer to invest 
a large share of his savings in a non-interest bearing speculative 
margin in the price of land. 
There are many explanations of the extraordinary rise in
-P-A-G-E-226
214 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
prices in the first decade of the twentieth century. It followed 
a period of depression. It was the period when people became 
conscious that the land supply is limited, and that the good, 
free land has been taken up. It was a period of great increase 
in the supply of gold and also a period of great increase in the 
use of bank checks in the place of gold certificates, — this is 
thought to be sufficient to account for half the rise in the prices 
of farm products. The ease with which old debts were paid with 
cheaper money has made people hopeful in obligating them- 
selves for the payment of larger debts. 
These are some of the most important principles and con- 
ditions which should be kept in mind in the consideration of 
the values of farm land, and of farm live stock and equipment. 
The prospective buyer of land will do well to bear in mind the 
advice of Cato, a Roman agricultural writer, who is quoted by 
Pliny 1 as saying: “‘ Do not be too eager in buyinga farm. In 
rural operations never be sparing of your trouble, and, above 
all, when you are purchasing land. A bad bargain is always 
a ground for repentance.”

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND 
Free land. Hitherto the progress of American agriculture 
has been powerfully influenced by the presence of vast areas 
of government lands which were easily secured, easily brought 
into cultivation, and which gave large returns upon invest- 
ments. The presence of these vast areas of cheap land of great 
fertility in a country where labor was scarce led to the inven- 
tion of many labor-saving devices until America became noted 
the world over for her agricultural machinery; but, above all, 
the presence of free land has made oppressions by landlords 
impossible. The farmers have been able to take up valuable 
government lands. This means of acquiring land ownership 
has been very important from the time the first settlers landed 
in the New World until the present time. When, in the earlier 
days, land became scarce in Massachusetts, emigration to Con- 
necticut set in, and when the best lands in both of these colonies 
were occupied, there still remained unoccupied good land in 
New York. When the small farmers of Virginia were crowded 
out by the great planters, they found unoccupied lands in North 
Carolina, and later they followed Boone into the wilderness of 
Kentucky. In time the occupation of the Mississippi valley 
was completed, and in more recent years, since the great plains 
have been made easily accessible by railways, the settlement of 
new land has gone on at an exceedingly rapid rate. 
That the acquisition of landownership was an easy task for 
the American farmer of the earlier days is indicated by the 
following quotation taken from a description of the settlements 
along the Monongahela in 1772 and 1773: “Land was the 
object which invited the greater number of these people to 
cross the mountains, for as the saying then was, ‘ It was to be 
215  
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
had here for taking up’; that is, building a cabin and raising 
a crop of grain, however small, of any kind, entitled the occupant 
to four hundred acres of land, and a preémption right to one 
thousand acres more adjoining, to be secured by a land office 
warrant.” } 
In 1790 Alexander Hamilton proposed a plan for the dis- 
position of the public lands which reads as follows: “In the 
formation of a plan for the disposition of the vacant lands of 
the United States there appear to be two leading objects of 
consideration: one, the facility of advantageous sales, accord- 
ing to the probable course of purchases; the other the accom- 
modation of individuals now inhabiting the western country, 
or who may hereafter emigrate thither. The former, as an 
operation of finance, claims primary attention; the latter is 
important, as it relates to the satisfaction of the inhabitants of 
the western country. It is desirable, and does not appear im- 
practicable, to conciliate both. Purchasers may be contem- 
plated in three classes: moneyed individuals and companies who 
will buy to sell again; associations of persons who intend to 
make settlements themselves; single persons or families, 
now resident in the western country or who may emigrate 
thither hereafter. The two first will be frequently blended, 
and will always want considerable tracts. The last will generally 
purchase small quantities. Hence a plan for the sale of the 
western lands, while it may have due regard for the last, should 
be calcuated to obtain all the advantages which may be derived 
from the two first classes.”’ ? 
The government was slow in formulating the plan which 
finally became most significant in the conversion of the public 
domain into a nation of farms. The American statesmen of 
the eighteenth century looked upon the western lands “as 
an asset to be cashed at once for payment of current expenses 
of government and extinguishment of the national debt.” * 
This desire to convert the public domain into cash led to the

sale of land in large tracts. Under the ordinance of May 20, 
1785, surveyed lands were offered in lots as large as a whole 
township of 36 sections of 640 acres each, for not less than $1 
per acre! Under an Act passed May 18, 1796, which provided 
for the survey of certain lands in the present state of Ohio, 
surveyed lands were to be offered at public sale in sections of 
640 acres, and in lots of eight such sections each. The minimum 
price was then fixed at $2 per acre.2 Prior to May 10, 1800, 
1,484,047 acres of land had been sold from the public domain 
for the benefit of the United States. From these sales was 
realized $1,201,725.68.3 ss 
Under an Act of May 10, 1800, land offices were opened in the 
Northwest Territory. The minimum price was kept at $2 
per acre. Lands were offered for three weeks at public sale in 
sections and half sections, and what remained at the end of 
this period was to be sold privately, as wanted, at the minimum 
price. During the next twenty years the net sales of govern- 
ment lands were 13,642,536 acres, from which the sum of 
$27,900,379.29 was realized. In 1820 the minimum price of 
land was reduced to $1.25 per acre. The revenue idea was 
gradually abandoned and the settlement of the western country 
came to be looked upon as the principal end in view in the dis- 
position of the public domain. 
The preémption system, which gave the preference to actual 
settlers in the sales of land at the minimum price, was em- 
bodied in sixteen special Acts between 1801 and 1841. At the 
latter date a general Act was passed which, with minor changes, 
remained in force until 1891. The actual settlers were per- 
mitted to enter upon tracts of land not larger than 160 acres 
nor less than 4o acres before such lands had been offered at 
public sale. The requirements were that the person should 
reside in a dwelling upon the tract, improve and cultivate a part 
of the land, and after a limited period pay $1.25 per acre. 
“The preémption system,” says Donaldson,® “arose from 
the necessities of settlers, and through a series of more than 57

years of experience in attempts to sell or otherwise dispose of 
the public lands. The early idea of sales for revenue was 
abandoned and a plan of disposition for homes was substituted. 
The preémption system was the result of law, experience, execu- 
tive orders, departmental rulings, and judicial construction. 
It has been many-phased, and was applied by special acts to 
special localities, with peculiar or additional features, but it 
has always and to this day [1880] contains the germ of actual 
settlement, under which thousands of homes have been made 
and lands made productive, yielding a profit in crops to the 
farmer and increasing the resources of the nation.” 
The Homestead Act of 1862 was the final step in the direc- 
tion of free land for actual settlers. This law was the result, 
in part at least, of the agitations of the Free Soil Democrats. 
They claimed “ that the public lands of the United States be- 
long to the people, and should not be sold to individuals, nor 
granted to corporations, but should be held as a sacred trust 
for the benefit of the people, and should be granted in limited 
quantities, free of cost, to landless settlers.” ! 
The homestead law enables the landless farmer to secure 
a quarter section, 160 acres, of land and acquire a title to the 
same by maintaining residence thereupon and improving and 
cultivating the land for the continuous period of five years.” 
“The homestead act,” says Donaldson,’ writing in 1880, 
“is now the approved and preferred method of acquiring title 
to the public lands. It has stood the test of eighteen years, 
and was the outgrowth of a system extending through nearly 
eighty years, and now, within the circle of a hundred years 
since the United States acquired the first of her public lands, 
the homestead act stands as the concentrated wisdom of legis- 
lation for settlement of the public lands. It protects the gov- 
ernment, it fills the states with homes, it builds up communities, 
and lessens the chances of social and civil disorder by giving

ownership of the soil, in small tracts, to the occupants thereof. 
It was copied from no other nation’s system. It was originally 
American, and remains a monument to its originators.” 
From 1873 to 1891 a Timber Culture Act was in force. This 
act, as first passed, enabled “ any person ” to obtain not more 
than 160 acres of land by planting 4o acres of timber and properly 
caring for the same for ten years. The number of acres of 
timber required was finally reduced to 10, and the period of 
cultivation to eight years. The privilege came to be restricted, 
however, to persons twenty-one years of age, heads of families, 
citizens of the United States, or one who has filed his declara- 
tion of intention to become such. The law was a failure from 
the standpoint of timber culture, but in all 44,229,950 acres 
of land were entered by this method. 
| The total area included in farms was more than doubled 
between 1860 and 1900. The acreage in farms was 407,212,538 
in 1860, and in 1900 it was 838,591,774. The importance of 
free land in this increase in the total area of land in farms is 
shown by the fact that between January 1, 1863, and June 30, 
1900, 188,149,032 acres of land were entered under the home- 
stead laws. It is estimated that public lands had been dis- 
posed of by the government prior to June 30, 1860, to the extent 
of 417,587,322 acres.! 
The free distribution of farms by the Government practically 
no longer exists. Although over one-tenth of the total land 
area of the United States, exclusive of Alaska and the insular 
possessions, remains unappropriated and unreserved (222,448,- 
225 acres in 1918 out of the total area of 1,900,947,200 acres), 
this land is nearly all desert or semi-desert and unsuitable for 
the production of crops. It is located principally in Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming, and most of it is used for grazing 
sheep and cattle particularly, during the winter and spring 
1 Donaldson (‘Public Domain,” p. 519) says: ‘The disposition of the public 
domain from its origin to June 30, 1883, is estimated at about 620,000,000 acres.” 
From this number has been subtracted the sum of the amounts annually disposed 
of each year from June 3o, 1860, to June 30, 1883, or 202,412,322 acres.
-P-A-G-E-232
  220 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
months when the vegetation is more abundant. A large 
acreage is required to support a family even in a modest 
pioneer manner, as is indicated by the fact that under the 
Grazing Homestead Act, which allows only 640 acres to an 
applicant, but 20,000,000 acres had been designated by June 30, 
1919, divided between nearly 33,000 applicants. Practically 
all these grazing homesteads which offer the slightest possi- 
bility of success have been applied for. When an Indian 
reservation is now thrown open to settlers there are many 
applicants for every desirable piece of land. In the summer 
of 1904 there were in one case 106,308 persons registered with 
the hope of drawing farms where there were but 2412 pieces of 
land of 160 acres each for distribution. 
Land settlement. While free land, useful for agricultural 
purposes, is scarce and no longer plays an important part in 
the maintenance of landownership on the part of farmers in 
the United States, there is much unoccupied land in the old 
forest regions which is now on the market at a low price. 
Whether the price is relatively low when compared with the 
old prairie farms may be doubtful, but the absolute figures look 
small to the farmer who has worked $200 land as a tenant until 
his hair is gray and who is still unable to make the first payment 
on the farm he occupies. The man in this position takes a 
trip to the cut-over country and finds an eighty-acre farm with 
thirty acres cleared and the remainder covered with second- 
growth, interspersed with occasional open grass spots connected 
by cow-paths. At first blush, before he has any idea of the 
cost of clearing the remaining fifty acres of brush land except 
the opinion given by the land agent, and without any knowledge 
of what a year’s labor will yield on this farm, $50 or $60 an 
acre sounds cheap. It is within his means. The desire for a 
home of his own after many years of tenancy turns the balance 
quickly in favor of buying. Thus it is that a good deal of the 
savings of tenant farmers occupying high-priced land is used 
in getting homes on the lower-priced and less valuable land. 
While this tends to emphasize tenancy in the regions of high 
land values it provides the funds for developing new lands and 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
    THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND 221 
helps to maintain the percentage of landownership in the United 
States as a whole. 
That this movement to cheaper lands in order to acquire 
landownership may have the best results for the farmers and 
for the country as a whole, the movement must be guided by 
people who know the possibilities of the land and who have no 
personal interest in any particular piece or kind of land. The 
dishonest real estate agent does much to retard this movement 
by levying a heavy tax upon the farmers who are so unfortunate 
as to fall into his hands. The honest, intelligent real estate 
agent who takes a professional interest in the upbuilding of his 
community is rendering a valuable service. Several states, 
through their immigration bureaus, are doing much to encourage 
the settlement of their sparsely settled regions by carrying on 
an educational campaign among those people who wish to 
move to newer and cheaper lands. Much more work needs 
to be done by these states in the way of establishing well- 
worked-out plans for settling the land on a basis profitable to 
the settler and to the state as a whole. This will not only in- 
crease the wealth of the country but facilitate the maintenance 
of the landowning farmer as the dominant class in American 
agriculture. 
Gift and inheritance. A vast amount of wealth passes on 
from generation to generation by gift and inheritance. Hence 
it is not necessary, in order to maintain the class of landowning 
farmers in a country where this class is already established, 
that each succeeding generation of farmers should save from the 
profits of their industry sufficient wealth to purchase their 
farms, and to hand this accumulated wealth over to the preced- 
ing generation of landowners. This would be necessary, 
however, in order to reéstablish a class of landowning farmers 
in one generation in a country where landlordism has become 
universal. In England, where most of the land is owned by a 
comparatively small number of landlords, the estates are handed 
down from generation to generation and thus remain the 
property of the landlord class; and in that country it is un- 
usual indeed for a tenant farmer to undertake to purchase
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
a farm. In Germany, where peasant proprietorship is the 
tule, the farms are handed down from father to son by in- 
heritance, and thus the property is kept in the hands of the 
tillers of the soil. The conditions with respect to inherited 
wealth are, therefore, of great importance in determining the 
status of farmers with respect to landownership. 
In the United States it is a matter of common observation 
that farmers who are able to do so, assist their sons in 
buying farms. This assistance may be relatively very great 
in the case of a wealthy farmer who has a small family; and 
again it may be very small in the case of a farmer in moderate 
circumstances, who has a large number of children among whom 
he wishes to distribute his assistance. Often the home farm is 
greatly enlarged by purchasing a “‘ forty ” here and an “ eighty ” 
there while the boys are growing to manhood, and then parceled 
out as the young men wish to establish homes for themselves. 
Again, when the parents are gone, the remainder of their ac- 
cumulated wealth passes by inheritance to their sons and 
daughters and helps very greatly in the enlargement of 
their farms as their growing families make larger farms de- 
sirable. 
The movement of population from country to city, which 
has been so great in recent years in this country, results in the 
transfer of a vast amount of wealth from the agricultural in- 
dustry, which must be replaced from some source if the wealth 
of farmers is not to decline. The general principle may be 
thus stated: The greater the amount of land and other forms of 
wealth acquired by one generation and transmitted to the farmers 
of the next, and the more evenly this wealth is distributed, the 
greater the ease with which the ownership of land may be acquired 
by the succeeding generations of farmers; but the larger the farm 
families of a given community, and the larger the percentage of 
each succeeding generation who seek a livelihood in other indus- 
tries, the greater the amount of wealth which will be drawn from 
agriculture into other industries by gift and inheritance, and the 
smaller the part which inherited wealth will play in the acquistion 
of landownership.

The number of persons employed in the various other occupa- 
tions has increased much more rapidly than has the number 
engaged in agriculture. This is shown by the following table, 
which gives the proportion, of those engaged in all gainful 
occupations, which were employed in “ agricultural pursuits.”’!

Perhaps the most important explanation of this more rapid 
increase in the percentage of those engaged in other occupations 
than agriculture, is the transfer of a share of the agricultural 
population to the other industries. This has often been spoken 
of as the movement from the country to the city. Men who 
have long been farmers sometimes move to the cities and enter 
other occupations, but what is more significant than this is the 
movement of the farm boys from country to city. A large 
percentage of the boys who are brought up in the country are 
educated and sent into the city, where they enter occupations of 
every description. A large percentage of the men who control 
the industries of cities to-day were one-time farm boys. 
This movement from country to city was especially rapid 
during the seventies and eighties for two reasons: First, agri- 
cultural methods were transformed by the introduction of labor- 
saving machinery, until a much smaller percentage of the total 
working population was required to produce the same supply 
per capita of food stuffs and raw materials. Second, the 
1 Twelfth Census of the United States, 1900, Special Reports, Occupations, 
PP. xxx, I. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  224 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ‘ 
manufacturing industries have been developing rapidly during 
the same period, giving opportunity for a share of the increasing 
farm population to find remunerative employment in the in- 
dustries of the cities. To quote Dr. A. C. True, “ Between 
1870 and 1890, speaking relatively and in round numbers, two 
million men gave up farming and went to join the great army of 
toilers in ovr cities. Taking their families into account, six 
million people from the farm were added to the population of the 
town. ... Men leave the farms because they are not needed 
there. The introduction of labor-saving machinery and rapid 
transportation has produced the same result in agriculture as in 
manufactures. A smaller number of men working in our field 
turns out a much greater product than the greater number of 
laborers could possibly secure in olden times, and the producers 
of all lands are easily carried where they are needed... . 
Within the past twenty-five years, invention has gained the 
mastery in agriculture as in other arts. The brain of man has 
triumphed over his hand here as elsewhere.” ! 
If only the poor moved from country to city, the total wealth 
of the country would be affected but little by this movement of 
population. But the rich farmers are quite as apt to move to the 
cities as are the poor ones, in fact they are perhaps more likely 
to do so, for they are in a position to live from the rent of their 
farms, as many retired farmers are doing in nearly every town 
of the country. The sons of the well-to-do farmers are more 
likely to receive an education and to be attracted to other 
pursuits than are the sons of poor farmers; on the other hand, it 
may be true in many cases that the son of a poor farmer would 
be more likely to seek employment in the city because his 
chances of getting a start in the country are not so good as those 
of the young man with a well-to-do father to aid him. 
This stream of population is carrying a vast amount of wealth 
from country to city every year. This movement of wealth 
from country to city has rightly been given as one cause of an 
increase in the percentage of tenancy, for it transfers to the 
city the owners of many farms, and these farms are cultivated 
1A. C. True, “The Arena,” Vol. XVII, pp. 538-539. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
    THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND 225 
by tenants until some farmer is able to acquire its ownership by 
transferring to the city owner an equivalent amount of wealth. 
Thus while gift and inheritance are economic conditions of 
great importance in determining the status of farmers with 
respect to landownership, and make any rapid change in their 
status in this regard impossible, some other means of accumu- 
lating wealth must be available if the present percentage of land- 
owning farmers is to be maintained. This leads to the investi- 
gation of savings in agriculture as a means of acquiring land- 
ownership. 
Savings. The process of saving from the earnings of many 
years and making a purchase is a means of acquiring land- 
ownership which is of especial significance in the consideration 
of the conditions which make it possible for tenant farmers 
to become landowners. The majority of the tenants are able 
to save from their earnings, because their net returns are more 
than enough to cover the expenses of living. When long periods 
of time are taken into consideration, the prices of agricultural 
products tend to be such that the total product of the least 
capable farmer who can remain permanently in the business will 
equal his cost of living and all other annual expenditures, 
including rent and normal returns on permanent investments. 
This is true partly because long-time-average prices are a most 
important factor in determining the degree of efficiency which is 
necessary for making a living by farming, and all who do not 
prove themselves efficient to that degree must leave agriculture 
to those who are more capable; again, it is true partly because 
the long-time-average price must be such as will encourage the 
production of sufficient produce to supply the effective demands 
of the people, and the least capable farmer who is required to pro- 
duce this supply must receive prices which will enable him to 
live in accordance with his idea of a living, to pay rent, wages 
(unless he and his family do all the work, in which case this 
item is included in a living), wear and tear on machinery, and 
normal returns on permanent investments. 
It is true, certainly, that, at any given time, there are those 
who are producing at a loss, others who are just able to make 
Q
-P-A-G-E-238
    226 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
both ends meet, and still others — and ordinarily this class 
includes the vast majority — who are able to make an extra 
profit because of their superior ability.* 
This differential gain, or profit due to superior ability, is the 
condition which, even where gift and inherited wealth are 
insignificant, makes it possible for farmers to accumulate wealth 
and to become the owners of farms. It is true, certainly, 
that the more efficient may live much better than the least 
capable, or marginal farmers, and thus the habits of life may 
reduce the power of the more efficient farmers to save from their 
profits. But the condition which gives rise to this differential 
gain certainly makes it possible for the more efficient tenant 
farmers to buy land. 
The greater the number of those who have gained a degree 
of efficiency above that of the marginal farmers and the greater 
the difference between the degree of efficiency of the majority 
of farmers and that of the marginal farmers, the greater is the 
differential gain which will go to farmers as personal profits, and 
the better able they will be to become landowners. On the other 
hand, the more homogeneous the farmers who supply the market, 
that is, the smaller the number who have gained a degree of 
efficiency above that of the marginal farmer and the less this 
degree of difference, the smaller is the total differential profit 
and the less able are tenant farmers to accumulate sufficient 
wealth to buy farms. 
Credit. It is a common practice in the United States for 
farmers to borrow money to invest in land. When a young 
man has saved enough money to pay some share, say half or 
two-thirds of the price of the farm, he borrows the remainder 
and makes an investment, a mortgage being given to secure the 
loan. This enables the farmer to buy land much sooner than 
he could if he were required to save the entire amount before 
making the purchase. Where the rate of interest charged is 
not too high, it is often more desirable to pay interest than to 
pay rent; for the difficulty of adjusting the relations between 
the landlord and tenant is in this way removed, and the farmer

THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND 227 
is free to improve the land as he chooses, knowing the benefits 
will be his own. 
Farm mortgage indebtedness was first reported by the United 
States Bureau of the Census for 1890. At that time 28.2 per 
cent of the farms operated by their owners were mortgaged. 
In 1900 the percentage was 31, and in 1910 it was 33.6. The 
total encumbrance reported was $1,085,995,960 in 1890 and 
$1,726,172,851 in 1910. The former represented 35.5 per cent 
of the value of the mortgaged farms, while the latter represented 
only 27.3 per cent. The lower rate is explained by the fact of 
increased land values. 
Throughout the southern states, where the percentage of 
tenancy is high, the percentage of mortgaged farms is low as 
compared with the percentage in the North, where the mortgage 
is used largely as a means of acquiring landownership on the 
part of youngmen. At the same time retiring farmers favor the 
plan of selling the farm and leaving a large share of its value 
in the land, taking a mortgage for security. This not only 
facilitates the climbing of the agricultural ladder on the part 
of the young farmer, but it aids the old farmer in making a safe 
retreat from the farm, giving him plenty of time to familiarize 
himself with other forms of investment before withdrawing 
his funds entirely from the form of investment which he under- 
stands. 
The extent to which mortgages are given to cover a part of 
the purchase price is illustrated by the following quotation 
taken from a special study made in connection with the census 
for 1890: 
“As a result of inquiries made in 102 selected counties, distributed 
throughout the United States, the conclusion is that 80.13 per cent 
of the mortgages in force were made to secure the purchase price of 
real estate and to make real estate improvements, when these objects 
are not complicated with other objects, and that the original amount 
of these mortgages is 82.66 per cent of the total original amount of 
all mortgages in force. If to these objects are added the objects of 
business and the purchase of various articles of personal property of 
the more durable kind, such as domestic animals, wagons, farm

machines, when not combined with other objects, the mortgages are 
89.82 per cent of the entire number in force, and their original amount 
is 94.37 per cent of the total original amount of all mortgages in 
force... . The mortgages distinctly representing a loss of wealth, 
or wealth soon to be consumed, are embraced in the description of 
farm and family expenses, and their number is 5.4 per cent of the 
total number of mortgages in force, while their original amount is 
1.73 per cent of the total original amount. ... A distinction must 
be observed between the cause and the consequence of mortgages. 
The mortgage, in its motive, is for the most part a mere business 
venture, and, so far as foreclosures show, for the most part a success- 
ful one. It becomes a misfortune when for any reason it becomes a 
business mistake.” 4 
These figures, it is true, refer to real estate mortgages gen- 
erally; but there is no reason for thinking that the mortgage 
is used for other purposes than the securing of the purchase 
price of real estate in the case of farm mortgages more frequently 
than in the case of other real estate mortgages. In general, we 
would be inclined rather to think that farm mortgages were 
more likely to be given to secure the purchase price than the 
mortgages on city lots, for example, where the total value of the 
lot might be relatively small compared with the value of the 
business which might be established thereon, and which might 
be an occasion for desiring to mortgage the real estate to secure 
funds to extend the business. In general, the conclusion which 
should be drawn seems to be that the mortgages on farms are 
in the vast majority of cases used as a means of making the 
transition from tenancy to landownership, and are frequently 
an evidence of growing prosperity. 
The evidence seems to show, also, that the farmers are usually 
successful in their use of the mortgage as a means of acquiring 
the ownership of land. In Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and 
New Jersey, from one-third to one-half per cent, only, of the 
farm mortgages are foreclosed each year;* and the average 
duration of farm mortgages in the United States is about five

years.! From this we may conclude that in the above-named 
states not much more than from one and two-thirds to two and 
one-half per cent of the farm mortgages are foreclosed. But 
we cannot argue from this that from ninety-seven and one-half 
to ninety-eight and one-third per cent of the mortgages are duly 
paid, out of the profits of agriculture. Many cases will come to 
the mind of the reader, where the unsuccessful aspirants to 
landownership have sold their mortgaged farms in order to pay 
off the mortgage and save a part of their original investment. 
However, it is fair to say that the vast majority of such ad- 
ventures prove successful. 
A classification by age groups of the owners of farm homes, 
in the United States, may be obtained for the years 1890 and 
1900, which gives the percentage of the owned farm homes which 
are encumbered. This classification is shown in the following 
table :?

From these figures it will be seen that the percentage of 
encumbrance increases from youth to middle age, and declines 
from middle age to old age. This fact, and also the relation 
between the increase in the percentage of mortgages and the 
decline in the percentage of tenancy, is shown more clearly in

and from Vol. II of the census for 1900.

When we consider the mortgage in all of its relations it is 
apparent that this is one of the important means of acquiring 
landownership; and while it sometimes proves disastrous, it is 
practically indispensable in our rural organization, and on the 
whole it may be looked upon as an institution favorable to the 
interests of the farmer. 
Credit systems have an important influence upon the per- 
centage of tenancy in a county. This is illustrated by the 
experience of Germany. 
Tenancy in Germany is largely among the occupiers of the 
very large and of the very small farms. This is shown in the 
following table:

232 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Not only is the percentage of tenancy low, but the statistics 
fail to prove any important change in this regard in recent years. 
In 1882, 15.71 per cent of the farms were composed solely of 
leased land, and in 1895 the percentage was 16.42; but at the 
same time, 12.88 per cent of all land in farms was leased land in 
1882 and only 12.38 per cent in 1895. It would appear, there- 
fore, that there was little change in the status of the farmers with 
respect to landownership during this period. Indeed Germany 
is a nation of landowning farmers, while in France 47.2 per cent 
of the cultivated area is occupied by tenants, and in England the 
landowning farmer is rarely found. 
Not only is it important that the young farmers who wish 
to go in debt for land should be able to borrow money at a low 
rate of interest, but it is equally important that the tenant 
farmers should be able to invest their savings in a profitable 
manner, until they have accumulated sufficient capital to 
enable them to invest in land. Furthermore, it is especially 
important that farmers who have accumulated funds beyond 
what they can use in their farming activities be provided with 
a safe investment other than land, lest they continue to buy 
farm after farm just as a safe investment, and in this way force 
the price of land too high for the young farmer. The remedy 
is to make it easy for every farmer to invest his surplus in 
federal farm loan bonds which pay a higher rate of return than 
farms let to tenants have been paying in the region of high land 
values. 
Integrity as a source of income. The young farmer wants 
to become the owner of a good farm with fine buildings and 
splendid equipments. In these days of high land values, this 
requires a large sum of money. Few can hope to acquire the 
desired farm by inheritance or even by marriage. These are 
both poor ways to acquire a farm, for if the farm should come 
by these means, the pleasure of earning it would be lost, and 
with it one of the greatest joys of life. 
Those who have made calculations upon the time required 
to earn and save the modest fortune required in these days to 
own a farm have too often left out of account certain very 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
    THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND = 233 
important sources of income. It is a matter of common obser- 
vation that the income of one man is often very much larger 
than that of another. There are those who are much inclined 
to attribute this to unfair dealing. The difference is due in a 
great measure to the fact that some men have more sources 
of income than others. 
There are four important sources of income: labor, managerial 
activity, integrity, and capital. The man who depends upon 
labor alone will have, as a rule, but a small income. It is when 
ability as a manager and integrity as a man begin to yield their 
income that the young man gets ahead rapidly. 
It has often been said, the first thousand dollars is the hardest 
to accumulate. This is true because it must be saved almost 
wholely from one source of income, —labor. From this one 
source of income must be provided food, clothing, and shelter 
for the worker, before anything can be put aside as savings. 
Add another important source of income and accumulation by 
saving becomes easier. 
The importance of integrity as a source of income cannot 
easily be overestimated. There are two ways of realizing 
upon integrity. Most men are willing to assume a certain 
amount of integrity on the part of young men. A young man 
can sometimes take advantage of the fact and, by dishonest 
actions, realize a small return once for all. It is not this method 
of realizing upon one’s stock of integrity that is to be dwelt 
upon here. The way to derive an important financial return 
from one’s reputation for integrity is not to sell out but to 
continually acquire more stock. 
Reputation for integrity gives the opportunity for the young 
man with little capital to realize upon his managerial activity. 
There are many owners of farms who, having grown old farming, 
are willing to turn their entire capital over to the management 
of a trustworthy young man. By working as a hired laborer on 
a farm, a young man may establish such a reputation for 
integrity that the owner of the farm will turn over the’ entire 
management of the farm and equipment to him as a tenant 
instead of as a directed hireling. The writer knows cases where
-P-A-G-E-246
  234 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
this has resulted in an increase in the income of a young man 
from thirty dollars a month and board to a thousand dollars 
a year. Integrity gives opportunity to realize upon one’s 
managerial ability by operating the capital which belongs to 
others. 
How should one inventory his resources? The capitalist 
values his stocks according to the income they yield. If a 
given certificate of stock yields $60 a year, and the correct 
rate of interest is 6 per cent he will value the stock at $1000. 
This is the capital value of the stock. If a young man can 
increase his annual income $360 by establishing a reputation 
for integrity, and thus securing an opportunity to manage 
the capital of others, why should he not look upon this stock 
of integrity as the capitalist does his stock? It would take 
$6000 loaned at 6 per cent to yield $360 annually. In counting 
his net worth at any given time the young man may well capi- 
talize his integrity. It is better to overestimate than to under- 
estimate the economic value of simple honesty as a resource, 
and as a source of income from which it is easy to save money 
and buy a farm. : 
Taxation. It has been noted by economists that the market 
price of land is often greater than the capitalization of the net 
rent at the current rate of interest. That is, men are willing 
to take a lower return on investments in land than on loans, 
even where the security is a farm mortgage. This is said to 
increase the difficulty of paying off farm mortgages. The man 
whose farm is mortgaged must pay, for example, 6 per cent 
for the use of money which, as an investment in land, is yielding 
him no more than 4 per cent. 
With the Ricardian theory of distribution in mind, which 
assumes that all farmers possess the same degree of efficiency, 
economists have concluded that this discrepancy between the 
net rent and the interest would make it practically impossible 
for the farmers to pay off their mortgages. It will be readily 
understood from the discussion of profits due to superior ability, 
that all but the less efficient farmers are able to counterbalance 
this loss by earning personal profits, so that the fact of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-247
    
THE FARMER’S MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND 235 
discrepancy is not so disastrous as has been supposed by the 
economists; yet this discrepancy has an important retarding 
influence upon the movement from tenancy to the unencumbered 
ownership of land. 
This difference between net rent and interest is due to many 
causes. Many of these causes have already been discussed in 
the chapter on the price of land; but we wish to emphasize 
especially the influence of double taxation in this connection. 
Double taxation, the taxing of both the farm and the mortgage 
upon the farm, tends to increase the difference between the 
rate which must be paid upon the loan and the returns received 
upon investments in land. The man who lends money upon a 
mortgage wants at least as large a return as if he had purchased 
the land himself. Had the man who lent the money purchased 
the land and rented it, he would have paid the land tax out of 
the net rent. If he lends the money and has to pay tax at the 
same rate on the mortgage, he will demand interest equal, at 
least, to the net rent of that proportion of the farm represented 
by the face of the mortgage. This means that the farmer will 
have to pay interest equal to the net rent and then pay the land 
tax besides; thus paying more in interest and in the tax, by 
the amount of the tax, than he would have paid as a tenant. 
To tax a farm mortgage is, therefore, to tax a farmer for using 
the mortgage as a means of acquiring landownership. 
While double taxation retards the farmer in acquiring land- 
ownership, there are forms of taxation which facilitate this rise 
in his status. Wherever there is a tendency for wealthy men 
to buy farm after farm from their superabundance of income, 
their bidding against the farmers drives the price of land too 
high and thus forces men to remain tenants who would be better 
farmers, better citizens, happier because they are paying out 
on a purchased farm. To discourage this outside competition 
which inflates prices and depresses farming, a progressive land 
tax is suggested. The essence of this tax is that the more land 
one owns beyond one farm of a specified maximum area, varying 
with the quality of the land, the higher the tax rate which is 
levied upon the land. When properly administered such a 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
tax will tend to keep the land on the market for those who wish 
to use it at a price not so far from its use value, and in this way 
facilitate land buying on the part of farmers. It is not at all 
necessary, in order to secure this result, that the tax be con- 
fiscatory. A slight discrimination against large holdings is 
sufficient to produce the desired result. 
Gift, inheritance, and profits, aided by a good credit system, 
are the most important means of acquiring the ownership of 
land. Now that the government has practically exhausted 
its supply of good farms, and competition is driving the price 
of land higher and higher, it becomes more and more important 
that every facility be provided the farmer for making the most 
of the means which yet remain for acquiring the ownership of 
land. The farmer should have every facility for acquiring a 
knowledge of the facts and principles which underlie his art, 
in order that he may so operate his farm as to win large profits 
from which to save money to invest in land

  CHAPTER XX 
TENANT FARMERS IN THE UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 
Prior to 1880 there were no statistics relating to tenancy 
and landownership in the United States. Regarding this period 
our knowledge must be based upon such statement as can be 
found in the literature of the period. Such material is unsatis- 
factory but in the absence of anything more reliable should be 
used. A little evidence is better than none even if it serve only 
to emphasize the lack of knowledge and to discourage the 
making of unwarranted assumptions. A wide range of opinion 
has been expressed regarding the prevalence of tenancy in the 
United States prior to 1880. One writer expresses the belief 
that at one time all farmers were landowners and that there 
had been a gradual decrease in the percentage of landownership 
on the part of farmers,' while another writer has expressed 
the conviction that the percentage of the tillers of the soil 
who own the land they cultivate has greatly increased since 
the middle of the nineteenth century.? It is doubtful if either 
of these positions can be proved to the entire satisfaction of all 
students of the question. 
It is the purpose in this chapter to piece together the evidence 
of tenancy in the United States prior to the first census report 
1 North American Review, Vol. 142, p. 393- 
2 Twelfth Census, Vol. V, p. Ixvi. In justice to the author of the statement 
referred to in the census, let it be made clear that landowning farmers are com- 
pared in importance not with tenant farmers but with all tillers of the soil other 
than landowning farmers. That is, tenant farmers and farm laborers have been 
thrown together, and the claim made that this class of non-landowning tillers of 
the soil has not increased so rapidly as the landowning farmers. It was not con- 
tended that the percentage of tenant farmers had not increased but that the per- 
centage of laborers had decreased more than enough to counterbalance the increase 
in tenancy, that the change was between these two classes, and that increased 
tenancy did not mean a decrease in the importance of landownership on the part 
of those engaged in farming. 
238 
   
-P-A-G-E-251
    TENANT FARMERS IN UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 239 
on the subject. The American farmer of the last quarter of 
the eighteenth century was as a rule owner of the land he tilled. 
While in England the term “ farmer ” was used at that time to 
designate a tenant farmer, in America the term had come 
to imply landownership. There were many reasons for the 
prevalence of landowning farmers and the scarcity of tenant 
farmers in America. The system of inheritance helped to 
maintain the class of landowning farmers. An agricultural 
writer of the period remarked: ‘ The little freeholders who live 
upon their own property make much the most considerable 
part of the whole province [of New England]. These are the 
posterity of former settlers, who, having taken in tracts of 
waste land proportioned to their ability, have died and left it to 
their descendants equally divided among all the children, 
by the gavelkind custom, which is prevalent throughout this 
province.” + 
High wages, accompanied by low land values and the possi- 
bility of taking up new land, made it relatively easy for 
the poor man who was industrious to risé to the position of 
landowning farmer. It could then be said that “ the evening 
of an industrious life is universally that of a little planter in 
the midst of all necessaries.” “‘ Their farms yield food, much 
of clothing, most of the articles of building, with a surplus suffi- 
cient to buy such foreign luxuries as are necessary to make life 
pass comfortably, there is very little elegance among them, 
but more of necessaries a greater capability of hospitality, 
and decent living than is to be found among the few remains 
of their brethren in England.” ? 
The self-sufficing character of the farm economy made it 
possible in spite of poor means of transportation for the farmer 
to go into the wilderness and carve out a home. The amount of 
money acquired to settle upon new land in the early days varied 
greatly. “In general, the settlers [in New York] come with 
a small sum of money, very many of them with none at all, 
1“ American Husbandry,” Vol. II, pp. 66 and 67. An anonymous work describ- 
ing American agriculture, published in 1776.

-P-A-G-E-252
  240 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, 
depending on their labor for three, five, or seven years to gain 
them a sum sufficient for taking a plantation, which is the 
common case of the foreign emigrants of all sorts. It is common 
to see men demand, and have, grants of land, who have no 
substance to fix themselves further than cash for the fees of 
taking up the land; a gun, some powder and shot, a few tools, 
and a plow. They maintain themselves the first year like the 
Indians, with their guns and nets; and afterwards by the 
same means with the assistance of their lands; the labor of their 
farms, they perform themselves, even to being their own car- 
penters and smiths; by this means, people who may be said 
to have no fortunes are enabled to live, and in a few years to 
maintain themselves and families comfortably. But such 
people are not to be supposed to make a profit in cash for many 
years, nor do they want or think of it.” 4 
“The new settlers [in New England]. . . enter at once into 
the class of freeholders, but from poverty in the beginning of 
their undertakings fall naturally into a class below [the older 
landowning farmers] unless they begin with a considerable 
sum of money that raises them in the consideration of their 
neighbors. There are many of these who begin with such small 
possessions, that they are some years before they can gain the 
least exemption from a diligence and active industry that equals 
any of the [tenant] farmers of Great Britain. Such men, 
although they may be in the road of gaining as comfortable a 
living as any of the old freeholders, yet rather fall into an 
inferiority to them; not from the manners or constitution of 
the colony, but from modesty and the natural exertions of a 
domestic industry.” 2 
“The new settlers upon the uncultivated parts of Pennsyl- 
vania fixed upon the spot where they intend to build the house, 
and before they begin it, get ready a field for an orchard, plant- 
ing it immediately with apples chiefly, and some pears, cherries, 
and peaches. This they secure by an enclosure, then they plant 
a piece for a garden; and as soon as these works are done 
they begin their house; some are built by the countrymen with- 
1“ American Husbandry,” Vol. I, p. 122. 2Ibid., Vol. I, p. 70. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  
  TENANT FARMERS IN UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 24% 
out any assistance, but these are generally very bad hovels; 
the common way is to agree with a carpenter and mason for 
so many days’ work, and the countryman to serve them as a 
laborer, which, with a few irons and other articles he cannot 
make, is the whole expense; many a house is built for less than 
twenty pounds. As soon as this work is over, which may be 
a month or six weeks, he falls to work on a field of corn, doing 
all the hand labor of it, and, from not yet being able to buy 
horses, pays a neighbor for plowing it; perhaps he may be 
worth only a calf or two and a couple of young colts, bought 
for cheapness; and he struggles with difficulties until these 
are grown, but when he has horses to work, and cows that 
give milk, and calves, he is then made, and in the road to plenty. 
It is surprising with how small a sum of money they will venture 
upon this course of settling.” + 
“Those who have money enough to stock a farm, have 
enough to settle a tract of waste land, which is much more 
flattering than being the tenant of another; one would suppose 
that such a circumstance would prevent their being a tenant 
in the country; but this is not the case, low rents and accidents 
sometimes induce them to live rather than to settle.” * 
While it was possible for those who dared brave the hardships 
and dangers of pioneer life to acquire homes with little money, 
conditions were somewhat different if the young man or the 
old settler wished to live in the older and well-settled commu- 
nities. In 1775 the best lands near Boston and Philadelphia 
would rent for five dollars per acre, and estates near Philadelphia 
were sold for $125 per acre. 
These high values were exceptional, however, and only a short 
distance back from the cities land values were relatively low. 
Besides the dangers and privations on the frontier and the fact of 
high land values near the cities, there were in these northern 
states men of the type of the English country gentlemen, who 
wished to own lands and live from the rents. This helps to 
explain the fact that there were tenant farmers in America in 
the eighteenth century. While the tenant farmers were the 
1“ American Husbandry,” Vol. I, pp. 190, 191. 2 Ibid., Vol. I, p. 63. 
R
-P-A-G-E-254
  242 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
exception, they were present, especially in the older settled 
districts and near the cities, in appreciable numbers. 
That the tenant farmers were as a rule young men using 
tenancy as a stepping stone to the position of independent 
landowning farmers, as is the case to-day, is evident, but the 
typical landlord of New England and Pennsylvania of the 
eighteenth century was not the retired farmer of to-day, but a 
“ country gentleman ” of the English type. 
“The most ancient settled parts of the province (New Eng- 
land) which are Rhode Island, Connecticut, and the southern 
part of New Hampshire, contain many considerable land 
estates upon which the owners live much in the style of country 
gentlemen in England. They all cultivate a part of their 
estates; and if they are small, the whole; this they do by 
means of their stewards, who are here generally called overseers ; 
the rest is let to tenants who occupy their farms by lease, in the 
same manner as in the mother country; the rents paid for such 
farms being the principal part of the landlord’s income.” 
“There are some country gentlemen in Pennsylvania who 
live on their estates in a genteel and expensive manner, but the 
number is but small; many are found who make much such a 
figure as gentlemen in England of three or four hundred pounds 
a year, but without such rental; for money is scarce in this 
country, and all the necessaries and conveniences of life cheap.” 
“ The method of living in Pennsylvania in country gentlemen’s 
families is nearly like that of England; the only business is 
to ride about the plantation now and then, to see that the over- 
seers are attentive to it; all the rest of the time is filled up with 
entertaining themselves; country sports, in the parts of the 
province not fully settled, are in great perfection; they have 
hunting but their horses are unequal to those of England; 
shooting and fishing are much more followed, and are in greater 
perfection than in England.” + 
In New England, where country gentlemen seem to have been 
more numerous than in other parts of the North, it could be 
said, in 1775, “‘ There are more estates that are under the 
1“ American Husbandry,” Vol. I, pp. 62, 185. 
   
-P-A-G-E-255
    TENANT FARMERS IN UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 243 
management of overseers than that are let to tenants.” This 
was doubtless due to the scarcity of men willing to be tenant 
farmers. The country gentlemen often turned to the exploita- 
tion of the timber resources lying about them, as a means of 
increasing their incomes as well as enlarging their agricultural 
domains. ‘The gentlemen of New England have an oppor- 
tunity of constantly increasing their estates. Those of fortune 
erect sawmills on their new grants, by which means they are 
enabled to make a very considerable profit by the woods at the 
same time that they lay the foundation of future estates for 
their posterity.” + 
It is evident that the “country gentlemen,’ — that is, 
men who were striving to live after the fashion of the smaller 
landlords of England who lived in comfort and even in some de- 
gree of elegance without putting their own hands to the plow, — 
were more conspicuous than were the tenant farmers. Yet there 
were tenant farmers in America on the birthday of our nation. 
The author of ‘‘ American Husbandry ” gives but slight infor- 
mation as to the methods of renting land. Tenants are spoken of 
in New England as occupying “ their farms by lease, in the same 
manner as it is in the mother country.” There is evidence that 
in 1775 rents near Boston and Philadelphia were paid in cash. 
But as early as 1795 Richard Peters was letting land near 
Philadelphia on a share system of tenure comparable to the 
system now in use in the dairy belts of the United States, which 
he thought more desirable than the cash system followed by 
others. The tenant furnished the implements of husbandry 
and the work horses, while the dairy cows, hogs, and sheep 
were owned jointly and fed from the undivided products of the 
farm. The horses were fed from the undivided hay but were 
fed from the tenant’s share of the grain. The taxes were shared 
equally by landlord and tenant. The cost of clover seed, and of 
commercial fertilizer, was shared equally.?

wrote of the various forms of share tenancy as follows: “In 
Maine, as in other parts of New England, the easy rates at 
which lands hitherto have been obtained in fee simple, and the 
scarcity of laborers, compared with the quantity of land to be 
occupied, have rendered it in general difficult to obtain rents 
for land. In some such instances it has been a custom for the 
landlord to furnish the implements, cattle, half of the seed, and 
pay half the taxes, and to receive half the products; in others, 
the tenant furnishes the whole of these except the taxes; and 
in some the landlord and tenant furnish different proportions 
according to circumstances. In most cases it is considered 
that one half of the crops, deducting one half the value of the 
seed and taxes, pays the expense of cultivation.” + 
There was never a time in the nineteenth century when tenant 
farmers could not be found in some parts of the United States. 
In 1821 the lands held in large tracts by landlords were rarely 
farmed by hired managers and laborers, but had long been in the 
hands of tenants. About the same time a writer from Prince 
Georges County, Maryland, was advising “leasing lands for a 
term of years.”* In 1829 “yearly tenancies” on estates of 
non-resident landlords was mentioned as a cause of the absence 
of good agriculture in Bedford County, Pennsylvania.* In 1833 
this statement appeared in the American Farmer, published at 
Baltimore, “Our farming tenantry are, literally speaking, an 
itinerant community.” ® A farm of 360 acres in New Castle 
County, Delaware, was reported as having been let to tenants 
continuously from 1669 to 1832. ‘The rent, in the latter part 
of the period, was paid in kind but was a stipulated quantity 
of each grain grown, not a share of the crop.® 
In 1843 B. J. Goldsborough, of Cambridge, Maryland, made 
the statement : “ A large proportion, say two-thirds, if not three- 
fourths of the farmers own the land which they till. ... The 
modes of renting or leasing land are various; in fact, we have

no well-defined system of any kind. A lease for more than two 
or three years isa rare thing. There is but little of the English 
system here, and but little land that is leased for money rent. 
The only settled thing seems to be that the tenant shall have 
house rent, fuel, pasture, and fodder for a cow or two, and a 
patch, not exceeding an acre, for a garden and a few potatoes. 
Sometimes the tenant gives only his labor for one-fourth of the 
crop, the landlord being to all the expense of teams, utensils, 
feed, etc. Then again the tenant furnishes these, getting one- 
half or two-thirds, according as the bargain may be respecting 
taxes, improvements and other matters.” ! 
An 8o-acre farm three miles from Mt. Holly, Burlington 
County, New Jersey, was rented from 1854 to 1859 for a cash 
rental of $600 per annum. Another farm of 70 acres rented on 
shares yielded the owner $800 in one year, which was thought 
to be no more than the average. These were not truck farms 
but depended on grain, stock, potatoes, and fruit.? 
In 1864, potato land near Chicopee in the Connecticut Valley 
was rented for $20 per acre.* 
That there were tenant farmers in the older settled parts of 
the country at the close of the eighteenth century was made 
clear in the last chapter, but tenancy was not confined, at that 
time even, to the regions long settled. In 1799 a young man 
21 years of age went from New England to Oneida County, New 
York, to make his way by farming. The country was then 
new, and having no money with which to buy land he entered 
into an agreement with a landowner to clear land for “ the first 
crop and ashes,” with board and team furnished by the landlord. 
With this opportunity as a starting point the young man came 
in time to be the owner of a farm of 250 acres, and this was 
done without leading a parsimonious life, for his country- 
life ideal was expressed as follows, ‘‘ My determination in the 
first place was to live pretty well, and if we could lay up 
anything against old age to do so.” 4

246 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The letting of land to a tenant who agrees to bring it into 
cultivation for all he can make on it for a given period of time 
has been practiced continuously in the undeveloped sections of 
the United States and is in use to-day. An interesting illustra- 
tion is found in the method used by N. Longworth, near Cin- 
cinnati, in 1845. A small vineyard was let to a German tenant 
for half the proceeds on condition that the tenant would “ trench, 
bench, and wall the south side hill and plant in grapes ” two 
acres per year for three years. Longworth said this work was 
worth $300 per acre. He said also that the thirty-five acres 
occupied by the tenant and which had three acres of grapes at 
the beginning of the tenancy, cost him $630. Obviously the 
German tenant, ignorant of American conditions, had paid dearly 
for the use of cheap land. Longworth said, “I made a hard bar- 
gain with him.”! And no one can question the statement. 
Longworth is not the only name connected with national 
politics to-day which was related to the tenant farmer of the 
first half of the nineteenth century. The Wadsworth estate in 
the Genesee Valley, with headquarters at Geneseo, N. Y., has 
been occupied in part by tenants for more than a hundred years.? 
In 1835 the tenants on the Wadsworth estate gave one-third of 
the crops as rent, and defrayed all the expenses of cultivation.® 
In 1841 Captain Barclay visited Geneseo. His Journal gives a 
more detailed picture of the tenant system on the Wadsworth 
estate, which can best be given by quoting: 
“T arrived at Geneseo about nine o’clock in the evening of the 20th 
of May, 1841... . Next morning I called on Mr. Wadsworth, one 
of the largest if not the most extensive landowner in the State of 
New York, to whom I had brought a letter of introduction. He lives 
in a fine house exactly resembling that of an English squire, pic- 
turesquely situated on a rising ground and commanding views similar 
in character and not excelled in beauty by the prospects from Rich- 
mond Hill or Windsor Castle. His family consists of two sons and 
a daughter, one of the former married and residing about a mile off; 
the other son and the young lady living with their father.

-P-A-G-E-259
    TENANT FARMERS IN UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 247 
“When I called the family were from home, but in a few hours 
Colonel Wadsworth, the younger son, visited me, in a most open and 
kind manner pressingly invited me to take up my residence at his 
father’s house, an invitation which I accepted. 
“T found the elder Mr. Wadsworth the very beau ideal of a fine 
old English country gentleman: tall and graceful in person, and in 
manners courteous, affable, and hospitable. 
“Mr. Wadsworth’s property comprises about forty miles of coun- 
try, the richness and picturesque appearance of which it is impossible 
in adequate terms to describe. Of this property Colonel Wadsworth 
occupies 1600 acres, 1000 of which, in the Genesee flats, are alluvial 
meadow land equal to any in the vales of Aylesbury and Buckingham. 
“Mr. Wadsworth has a numerous tenantry, but under a tenure 
which can yield neither profit to the landlord nor benefit to them- 
selves; they have no leases, but plow and sow from year to year, 
the landlord receiving for rent a portion of the produce in kind. 
His portion is ascertained on the field after the crop is reaped, and 
is delivered by the tenants at an appointed barn where it is instantly 
threshed out and the straw given to the winds. Such a system must 
be a bar to every improvement ; it in fact operates as a prohibition 
of all exertion and expenditure by the tenant for increasing the 
fertility of his farm, it being unreasonable to expect that any tenant 
will use exertions or lay out capital, where the landlord is to reap, 
certainly a large share of the benefit thence accruing, and from the 
precariousness of the tenure perhaps the whole. Mr. Wadsworth 
therefore may go on to draw his share of the pittance of grain which 
his tenants may under present circumstances be able or disposed to 
raise, but he must lay his account that in these circumstances nothing 
can be done by them to improve the soil and render it duly pro- 
ductive: . 5. 
“Now, although Mr. Wadsworth is an acute well-informed man 
who must have seen well and far before him, having at an early 
period made an extensive purchase of land at a price greatly under 
the value to which time and circumstances have raised it, yet it 
appears to me he is much wedded to old customs, otherwise he would 
at once perceive the advantage of dividing his estate into farms of a 
proper size, erecting on them suitable buildings, and granting leases 
for such a term of years as would insure to the tenants a return for 
money expended on improvements. By similar means and by es- 
tablishing and stipulating for judicious modes of culture, the value of
-P-A-G-E-260
248 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
land in Scotland has in my own time been tripled; and I have no 
doubt that by adopting them the value of Mr. Wadsworth’s prop- 
erty would be increased in the same ratio; but I was unable by this 
argument or by any other to persuade him to change his system of 
tenancy.” ! 
This criticism by Captain Barclay, made in the face of the 
fact that he had been entertained in the house of this American 
country gentleman of the English type requires some explana- 
tion. The original James Wadsworth of Geneseo, while travel- 
ing in Europe in connection with the sale of lands in western 
New York, formulated the plan of establishing himself in the 
Genesee Valley after the fashion of an English landlord. It 
is fair to assume, therefore, that he was not without knowledge 
of the English system of leasing land. That he should have 
modified his system to conform to American conditions is a 
mark of his sagacity. Furthermore at the time when James 
Wadsworth was falling in love with the English landed estates, 
letting land from year to year was the rule in England, but 
a cash rent was the rule instead of a share of the crops. | It 
should be noted also that seventy years of experience has 
proved that Captain Barclay’s view on the subject of long 
leases has not been adhered to in Great Britain. 
Whatever truth there may have been in Captain Barclay’s 
criticism to the effect that the Wadsworth in charge of the 
estate in 1841 was much wedded to old customs, the system of 
rent paying on the Wadsworth estate had materially changed by 
1867 and more or less in conformity to the suggestion of Barclay, 
at least the rent had become a fixed charge instead of a share, 
though the payment was partly made in kind. 
In writing of tenant farming in 1867, a correspondent of the New 
England Farmer residing in Orleans County, New York, said: 
“Probably one of the best systems of tenant farming in this coun- 
try is that adopted on the Wadsworth farms, in western New York, 
which are only let from one year to another. But then no tenant is 
turned off without cause; the rule being never to turn off a good 
tenant, nor keep a poor one. These farms are managed by an ex- 
1“ Agricultural Tour in the United States,” pp. 36, 38, 44. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
    TENANT FARMERS IN UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1880 249 
perienced agent, who each year directs which fields are to be sown 
to wheat, which put into spring crops, and which mowed or pastured ; 
all being arranged in rotation, so as to keep the land in good condi- 
tion, and give a reasonable chance to make money. The rent being 
a certain amount of wheat per acre, for the land sown to wheat; 
something less, in money, for spring crops; less yet for meadow, and 
least of all for pasture. The tenant also pays a moderate rent for 
buildings and orchard, and all taxes. Repairs made by tenant, new 
buildings and fences by landlord. Stipulations in regard to seeding 
down and making manure are favorable to the land, without being 
hard on the tenant. About one-fifth of the farm is generally sown 
to wheat, which gives a good income to the proprietor, and a good 
chance to make money to the tenant.” ! 
While the methods of letting land on the Wadsworth estate 
have not conformed very closely in detail to the English system, 
the general principles of estate management are essentially 
the same. The estate agent is found performing the same 
functions as in England and the idea of living after the fashion 
of the English country gentleman has not been lost sight of by 
the present generation. In 1907 one driving about Geneseo 
might meet upon the road a carriage party driven by a liveried 
coachman similar to that of an English squire or a Scottish 
laird. Considerable space has been given to the Wadsworth 
estate because it is a rare instance of a landed estate of the 
English type in America. 
Tenant farming in New York was not confined to large 
estates. An instance is given of a dairy farm with 25 cows in 
Herkimer County which had long been operated by the owner 
but which was being operated by a tenant in 1845.2. In the 
sheep regions of New York and Vermont farms were sometimes 
let to tenants who owned a half interest in the “ sheep and other 
stock.” § 
To quote from The Cultivator of 1844, “ The practice prevails, 
to some extent, of letting farms to tenants, and receiving in the 
shape of rent a portion of the produce in kind, say a third, half, 
1 New England Farmer, 1867, p. 97.

-P-A-G-E-262
  250 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
or two thirds, varying with the amount of stock, seed, etc., 
furnished by the proprietor.” 1 This probably relates to the 
state of New York. 
H. L. Ellsworth, an owner of large areas of land near La- 
fayette, Indiana, throws some light upon tenant farming in 
Indiana in 1845: “I was offered sixteen bushels of corn as 
rent, per acre, instead of one-third of the crop which is the usual 
share for the landlord. I have rented one thousand acres of 
ground for sixteen thousand bushels of shelled corn delivered in 
the crib.” Similar methods of renting land were in use near 
Coshocton, Ohio, where in 1850 there were “ many large land- 
holders,”’ some of whom rented out their lands on shares, or for 
20 bushels of corn per acre. The tenants occupied only from 
year to year.® 
As far west as Oskaloosa, Iowa, farm land was rented to 
tenants as early as 1858.4 In Illinois, in 1859, when land could 
be purchased for $2.50 an acre land was let to tenants for a 
share of the grain. Near Belvidere, Illinois, in 1860, a region 
which had been settled about 25 years, the ‘‘ renting so many 
farms without having them stocked” is mentioned as having 
a bad effect upon the agriculture of the region, but is explained 
by the lack of capital.6 Near Madison, Wisconsin, a landlord 
was advertising for a man “to carry on a large farm either 
as foreman or on shares, for a term of years.”’7 
These statements give no basis of passing judgment on the 
question as to the numerical importance of tenant farmers prior 
to the Civil War, but they give such evidence of the existence of 
tenancy as keep the student from being surprised when he comes 
upon the statistics of tenancy in 1880 and finds that a fourth of 
the farmers did not at that time own the acres they tilled.

  CHAPTER XXI 
FARM OWNERSHIP AND TENANCY IN THE UNITED STATES 
SINCE 1880 
In 1880 there were 4,008,907 farms in the United States. 
Three-fourths (74.44 per cent) of these farms were occupied by 
owners, while one-fourth (25.56 per cent) were operated by ten- 
ants. The tenant farmer was not confined to the older parts 
of the United States. The renting of farms was practiced in 
the regions of most recent settlements as well as in the older 
states of the East. Tenants were found on the very margin of 
cultivation in central Kansas. In Illinois there were more 
tenants than in any other state in the Union. The percentage 
of all farms operated by tenants was only 8.2 in Massachusetts, 
and 16.5 in New York and in Pennsylvania, while 31.4 per cent 
of the farms of Illinois were operated by tenants. 
In 1910 there were 6,361,502 farms in the United States, 63 
per cent of which were operated by the owners directly or 
through hired managers, while 37 per cent were operated by 
tenants. The greater part of this increase took place prior to 
1900. The percentage of tenants in 1900 was 35.3. Thus the 
percentage of tenancy increased only 1.7 between 1900 and 
1910, while the percentage rose from 28.4 in 1890 to 35.3 in 
rgo0o, an increase of 6.9. Our chief attention should be given, 
therefore, to the explanation of changes in tenancy prior to 
1goo. The tenure statistics for the four census dates for which 
such statistics are available are not exactly comparable. For 
1900 and 1910 farms operated by owners are divided into three 
classes. In 1910 those owning all the land they operated repre- 
sented 52.7 per cent of all farmers, those renting additional 
land 9.3 per cent, those operating through hired managers .9 
per cent. The percentage of the improved land operated by 
tenants was 32.7 in 1910. The percentage in 1900 was 30.2. 
251  
-P-A-G-E-264
  252 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Thus in terms of area, tenancy has not made quite as great 
inroads as the percentage of farms operated by tenants would 
indicate. The increase between 1900 and 1910 is greater, how- 
ever, in terms of improved land than in terms of farms. 
The percentage of tenancy was higher in many southern 
states than in Illinois, but it does not necessarily follow that 
a higher proportion of the farm land in the South was rented. 
In the South tenant farms were usually small and owned farms 
were generally large. This is shown in the following table:

In the four corn states under consideration in this table, there 
is no such marked difference in the proportion of rented and of 
owned farms under fifty acres. This gives ground for the 
belief that the percentage of the agricultural area operated by 
tenants in the South was much smaller, in 1880, than the per- 
centage of farms operated by tenants. 
A share of the product was the most common form of rent 
throughout the Union in 1880, with the exception of a few 
counties in the Cotton Belt where the rent took the form of a 
specified amount of cotton and was counted as cash rent in the 
census reports. Of all farms in the United States 17.52 per 
cent were operated by share tenants, 8.04 per cent by cash

tenants, and 74.44 by owners. This predominance of share 
tenancy explains why references to tenancy in the literature 
of the earlier decades related so generally to share tenancy. 
Share tenancy had many forms and was common. Cash 
tenancy was less common and was more simple and less varied 
in form, hence cash tenancy was discussed less than share 
tenancy. 
The decade following the census of 1880 brought an increase 
of a half million in the number of farms. The increase in tenant 
farmers was more than proportionate, and the percentage of 
share tenants rose to 18.41, that of cash tenants to 9.96, while 
the percentage of owners fell to 71.63. In the decade from 1880 
to 1890 share tenants increased in numbers in the new grain- 
growing region of Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska, and 
Kansas. There was a marked increase in the number of share 
tenants in the cotton regions of Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia. 
Cash tenants increased markedly in the cotton region of South 
Carolina, Alabama, and the alluvial of the Mississippi. 
The next ten-year period brought an increase of more than a 
million in the number of farms, but in spite of the increase in 
farms, the percentage of tenancy increased more rapidly than 
in the preceding decade. In 1900 share tenants constituted 
22.2 per cent, cash tenants 13.1 per cent, leaving 64.7 per 
cent representing farms operated by owners or part owners 
directly or through hired managers. It will be noted that cash 
tenants increased at a more rapid rate than share tenants. 
This was especially true in those cotton states where negroes pre- 
dominated. In Texas where cotton is grown largely by white 
farmers there was an increase from 33.1 to 42.4 in the percentage 
of share tenants and a decline from 8.8 to 7.3 in the percentage 
of cash tenants. In South Carolina the percentage of cash 
tenancy increased from 27.75 in 1890 to 36.7 in 1900, while the 
percentage of share tenancy decreased from 27.5 to 24.3. But 
the more rapid increase in cash tenancy was not confined 
entirely to the South. In Iowa the percentage of cash tenants 
increased from 12.35 in 1890 to 19.5 in 1900, the percentage 
of share tenancy declined from 15.7 to 15.4 in the same period. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
    
FARM OWNERSHIP AND TENANCY IN UNITED STATES 257 
In the South regions of cash tenancy are more generally 
regions of negro tenants. In the Black Prairie of Texas, where 
share tenants are very numerous, negro tenants are scarce 
and white tenants are present in great numbers. In the Yazoo- 
Mississippi delta, where with the exception of two counties cash 
tenancy prevails, negroes constitute almost the whole tenantry. 
The same is true of the Black Prairie of Alabama and eastern 
Mississippi. In Georgia and South Carolina negro tenants 
and cash tenancy are associated together while farther to the 
north and northwest, in these two states, where share tenancy 
prevails, the negro tenant is not common, while white tenants 
are found in abundance. 
It should be borne in mind that the cash rent of the Cotton 
Belt is not necessarily a fixed amount of money. It is very 
commonly a fixed amount of cotton. Furthermore it should not 
be inferred that cash rent necessarily represents a higher form 
of tenancy than share rent. These subjects will be discussed 
in detail in later chapters on the methods of renting land. The 
purpose here is to show the trend of affairs with regard to the 
increase in tenancy. 
By comparing the figures one will has impressed with the 
enormous increase in the number of tenants between 1880 and 
1900. During this twenty-year period the total number of farms 
increased 43 per cent, while the number of farms operated by 
cash and share tenants increased 98 per cent. These questions 
properly arise: Why should the percentage of tenancy increase 
so rapidly during a period when so many new farms were becom- 
ing available? Is it not true that these new farms have been 
secured by taking up new lands at a low price which is conducive 
to an increase in the ownership of land on the part of tenants? 
In answering these questions many facts need be taken into 
account. It is true, when the United States is considered as a 
whole, that the area in farms has increased more rapidly than 
has the number of farms, so the average size of farms was 
greater in 1900 than in 1880. The average size in 1880 was 
133-7 acres, while in 1900 it was 146.6 acres. But when the 
specific states are considered in which tenancy has been in- 
s  
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
creasing so rapidly, the matter appears somewhat different. 
This is shown in the following table:

These figures suggest that the increase in tenancy may have 
resulted from the breaking up of large farms into small holdings 
let to tenants. All of the states in the above table showed a 
marked decrease in the number of farms containing 500 acres 
and over, and a great increase in small farms. 
The decline in the number of large farms was not confined 
to the Southern States. The number of farms of 500 acres and 
over in Illinois decreased from 3898 to 2333, though there was 
no important change in the average size of farms in that state 
owing to counterbalancing changes in other size groups. In 
Texas a breaking down of large farms into small ones was 
going on in the Black Prairie, but this was more than counter- 
balanced in the state as a whole by the development of large 
ranches in the cattle country to the west and south. Hence, 
this cotton and cattle state illustrates the way in which averages 
covering diversified territory cover up the facts regarding the 
tendencies in given regions. 
That cotton production was gradually becoming organized 
on a tenant basis instead of a wages system is further borne out 
by statistics which show a decline in the expenditure for labor 
in 18701 and in 1900 in this region. There was a decline in the

wages system in the same regions where large farms were 
decreasing and where small farms and tenant farmers were 
rapidly increasing. These facts seem to bear out the theory 
that in the Cotton Belt tenancy had increased at the expense 
of the wage laborers and hence marked a rise in the status 
of the tillers of the soil. The extent to which this change in 
name corresponded to a real change in economic status will be 
considered later. 
Lest there should be a tendency to credit the high percentage 
of tenancy in the South entirely to the presence of the negro, 
who so recently started life as a freedman with nothing but his 
hands, let it be noted that in the Black Prairie of Texas and in 
the northern parts of the cotton regions of the older cotton 
states, where the farmers are generally whites, the increase 
in tenancy has gone on with very great rapidity if not quite as 
rapidly as in the regions of negro tenants. By comparing the 
location of slaves in 1860 with the location of negro tenants in 
1g1o it becomes obvious that in the southern states few negro 
tenants were found in 1910 beyond the regions where they were 
abundant as slaves in 1860. In the new cotton region of Texas 
the whites have gone in to occupy the land. The remarkable 
thing is that they are so generally tenants. 
One hypothesis which may be ventured as an explanation of 
this common fate of the whites of the new cotton region and the 
negroes of the old cotton regions, is that while in the old slave 
regions the wages system gradually gave way to a form of tenant 
holdings which the census recognized as separate farms, there 
was a breaking down of great cattle ranches in Texas into 
small farms and that white immigrants, largely from the older 
cotton states, went in as tenants of the large proprietors. The 
two cases had this in common that the land had previously been 
acquired in large estates. The breaking down of large farms 
does not imply the breaking down of estates. The change may 
have been in the landlord’s method of operating his land. 
The change from large farms operated by hired laborers to 
estates of small farms operated by tenants is not a complete 
explanation of the increase in tenancy. 
   
-P-A-G-E-273
    FARM OWNERSHIP AND TENANCY IN UNITED STATES 261 
It is a matter of common observation that in the northern 
states, young men start in as laborers, become tenant farmers, 
and later buy farms and join the ranks of landowning farmers. 
The above facts show that in the southern states the movement 
from the wage earners to tenant farmers was abnormally rapid 
between 1880 and 1900, due to a reorganization of the methods 
of handling landed estates. To some extent this same move- 
ment was in evidence in central Illinois and in other northern 
states, but there are facts which tend to show that the increase 
in tenancy was due in part to a slowing down of the movement 
from tenancy to ownership. This is shown in the following table:

This table indicates that nearly three-fourths of the farmers 
under twenty-five years of age are tenants; that the percentage 
of tenant farmers declines, and the percentage of landowning 
farmers increases, as we pass from the younger to the older age 
periods, until less than a fifth of the farmers who are fifty-five 
years of age and over are tenants. 
Statistics of this kind were first collected in 1890, and while 
they showed the status at that time and suggested a movement 
from tenancy to landownership, they did not prove the existence 
of such a movement. By comparing the figures for 1890 with 
those for 1900, this movement is clearly shown. The occupiers 
of farm homes who were from 25 to 34 years of age in 1890, were 
from 35 to 44 in 1900. By comparing these occupiers at the 
two dates, we find an increase in the percentage of home owners,

These figures indicate a constant movement from tenancy to 
landownership. But, from generation to generation, a smaller 
percentage of the farmers are able to make this transition. It 
should be noted in the above table that of the occupiers of farm 
homes who were under 25 years of age, a smaller percentage 
were owners in 1900 than in 1890. This is true for every age 
period given in the table except one; the reverse being true 
for the period from 35 to 44. This suggests that the decline 
in the percentage of landownership is due, in part, to the in- 
ability, or disinclination, of the succeeding generation to acquire 
landownership so generally as their predecessors. 
The movement from tenancy to ownership has been more 
complete in some parts of the United States than in others. 
This is shown in the previous table, which shows the farm 
homes of selected states classified by tenure and by age of the 
farmer. 
These figures show that in those southern states where negro 
farmers are dominant the movement from tenancy to ownership 
is far less pronounced than in Texas where the whites predomi- 
nate over the blacks. In the Northern States farmers appear to 
be highly successful in becoming the owners of farms. Even in 
Illinois, where 39.3 per cent of the farmers were tenants, all but 
about one-tenth of the farmers 65 years of age and over had 
succeeded in becoming owners. The residuum of tenants left at 
this age was 8.6 per cent in Iowa, 7.6 per cent in Indiana, and 
only 4.1 per cent in Wisconsin. To contrast the old with the 
new, Massachusetts showed 4.3 per cent and Nebraska 13.6 
per cent of tenancy among farm-home owners 65 years of age 
and over. That this contrast is not general is shown by the 
fact that in North Dakota the percentages of tenancy among 
these older farmers was only 5.1. 
A proper conception of the economic status of the American 
farmer at the close of the nineteenth century must give proper 
emphasis to the fact of landownership on the part of farmers. 
In the North landowning farmers generally predominated. In 
the Cotton Belt tenants outnumber the landowning farmers. 
Figure 12 shows the distribution of landowning farmers in 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  FARM OWNERSHIP AND TENANCY IN UNITED STATES 267 
tg1o. The small number of owners in that region is indicative 
of the fact that in the South there is a distinct tenant class. 
In the Cotton Belt the land is still in the possession of a land- 
lord class. In parts of Virginia where the land has not been 
so generally retained in large estates, the percentage of land- 
owning farmers among the negroes is very high. This can be 
explained in part by the lack in eastern Virginia of a great staple 
crop like cotton which would make profitable the operation of 
plantations by tenants, and partly by the fact that the negroes 
of Virginia are a higher type than those of the Cotton Belt. 
The apparent superior economic position of the northern 
farmer is somewhat reduced when the question of mortgage 
indebtedness is raised. In 1900, 30 per cent of the farm homes 
occupied by owners were mortgaged. The census for 1900 
shows a more complete analysis of the farming classes by tenures 
than do the census reports for 1880 and 1890. Those other 
than cash and share tenants renting all the land they cultivated 
were divided into four classes, namely, owners, 54.9 per cent, 
part owners, 7.9 per cent, owners and tenants, .9 per cent, and 
managers, 1 per cent. The practice of farming a tract of rented 
land in addition to the land owned seems to have been a common 
practice in many of the grain-growing sections. 
Farms operated by managers were not so numerous but were 
more generally large farms, so that while they are only 1 per 
cent of the farms they represent 10.7 per cent of the aggregate 
area in farms. In spite of the fact that these farms include 
many of the country homes of wealthy city folk, the cheap areas 
of the West included in these managed farms reduce their value 
to only 5.5 per cent of the aggregate value of farms. 
The position of the tenant farmers is better understood when 
one knows more of the character of the landlords whose land 
they cultivate. It has been shown that in the North most 
tenant farmers sooner or later become landowning farmers, while 
in the South a very large proportion of the tenants never rise 
to the position of landowners. The vast majority of the rented 
farms in the North are owned by men who have passed through 
various stages of acquiring land for their own use, and who are 
   
-P-A-G-E-280

found in the landlord class only in the later years of their lives. 
In the southern states, in the region of negro cotton tenants, 
there is a landlord class whose life work is the management of 
landed estates operated by tenants. 
: Great landed estates, such as the Scully and the Sibley 
: estates in Illinois, and the Wadsworth estate in New York, 
are found here and there in the North, but they are exceptions. 
As a rule the landlords are retired farmers. Even in the South, 
outside of the areas densely populated with negroes engaged 
in cotton production, which is equivalent to saying outside of 
the regions where large cotton plantations were operated by 
slaves in 1860, the landlords with but one or two tenants are 
most common. 
The statistics relating to the ownership of rented farms in 
1900 were published for no territorial unit smaller than the 
state, hence the statistics do not show the contrast within the 
southern state with respect to the size of estates in the counties 
where negro tenants predominate in numbers and in the counties 
where white tenants are in the majority, but the influence of 
the old cotton plantation system and its reorganization upon 
the statistical averages for the South is shown by the fact that 
while only 2 per cent of the rented farms owned by residents 
of the North Central States were in estates comprising ten farms 
or more, the percentage of farms of the same class in the South 
Central States was 20.9. 
Landlords in the United States, whether they belong to the 
numerous class of retired farmers or to the small class of owners 
of great estates, are, as a rule, residents of the district in which 
their lands are located. ‘‘ Of the 1,934,346 farms in the United 
States for which the names and post-office addresses of the 
owners were reported, the owners of 1,523,863, or 78.8 per cent, 
resided in the same county in which their farms were located ; 
307,656, or 15.9 per cent, in the same state but not in the same 
county; 102,827, or 5.3 per cent, outside of the state (of which 
1097, or .o51 per cent, were in foreign countries). Many 
residing in the same state, but not in the same county, had 
homes very near their rented farms. This was notably the   
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  FARM OWNERSHIP AND TENANCY IN UNITED STATES 269 
case with farms located near county lines. Such owners can 
hardly be classed as non-residents, and the very small per cent 
of rented farms owned by non-resident landlords would have 
been still further reduced if it had been practicable to exclude 
such owners. 
“The Western division had the smallest proportion of rented 
farms whose owners resided in the county where their rented 
farms were located.... The South Central and South 
Atlantic divisions had the largest proportion of owners residing 
in the county where their rented farms were located... . 
The North Central division had the largest, and the Western 
the next largest, proportion of rented farms with owners residing 
outside of the state.” + 
The character of the landlord has great significance when 
viewed from the standpoint of the tenant farmer who hopes 
to rise to the position of a landowning farmer. Land leased by 
the retired farmer is not held out of the market for many years, 
because of the limits set to life. Upon the death of the retired 
farmer, if not at an earlier date, the land is divided among heirs 
or sold to settle the estate. This brings land upon the market 
and helps those who inherit the proceeds to buy farms. Per- 
manent landed estates managed by a landlord class keep land 
off the market so far as tracts of a size which a small farmer 
can buy are concerned, and the influence of inheritance is to 
maintain the landlord class. The permanent landlord class 
trained to manage estates operated by tenants is, however, not 
without its redeeming feature, as any one will conclude who 
studies the present methods of operating landed estates in the 
regions of negro tenants in the South to-day. Trained land- 
lords with large estates are, as a rule, more agreeable for a 
tenant, white or black, to deal with than are the retired farmers 
who enter the landlord class for a few years late in life.

  CHAPTER XXII 
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 
IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TENANCY A GOOD THING ? 
In the discussion of the size of farms it was noted that for a 
given farmer engaged in a given type of farming at a given 
stage in his own development, and with given conditions with 
respect to wages, interest, land values, and prices for his prod- 
ducts, there is a size of farm which will pay him best. The 
question now to be taken up relates to the various ways in which 
he can get the use of the amount of land he finds it most profit- 
able for him to operate. 
Few young farmers are financially able to own the amount of 
land they can operate to best advantage. If each man operated 
the land he is capable of owning, many young farmers would 
be operating farms too small for their energies, and many old 
farmers would have in hand far more land than they could 
utilize advantageously, to the loss of the young farmer, the old 
farmer, and the people of the nation who consume farm 
products. 
Farm tenancy is an institution which provides for getting the 
land into the hands of those who are in a position to cultivate it, 
but who are unable to buy farms. In its best forms, tenancy 
in a limited amount may be a good thing. In 1910 there were 
2,354,676 or 37 per cent of the farmers of the United States 
reported as tenants who owned none of the land they farmed, 
and 593,825 or 9.3 per cent who leased part of the land they 
cultivated. Thus, it would seem that nearly half of the farmers 
are using tenancy as a means of securing the use of the land 
they feel capable of operating, but which they are not yet able 
to own. It is, therefore, a matter of great importance that the 
methods of leasing land be such as will be conducive to good 
270
-P-A-G-E-283
    
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 271 
farming and to the well-being of the tenant farmers and to the 
nation as a whole. 
A large proportion of the tenant farmers are young men who 
are in the process of earning enough money to buy a farm. 
This is especially the case in the Northern States. In Illinois, 
for example, nearly 44 per cent (43.77) of farm homes which 
were rented were occupied by persons under thirty-five years 
of age, whereas less than 15 per cent of those owning their farm 
homes were under thirty-five years of age. 
The owners of rented land are quite generally older farmers 
who have retired or who have more land than they wish to 
farm; 80 per cent of the owners of rented land have but one 
farm let to tenants, 11.4 per cent have but two, 5.4 per cent 
have three or four, 2.3 per cent have five to nine, .7 per cent have 
ten to nineteen, .2 per cent have twenty or morefarms. Taking 
the United States as a whole the large estate made up of rented 
farms is the exception and the landowner with one or two 
farms to rent is the rule. In a vast number of cases the tenant 
is the son or son-in-law of the landlord. At the time when the 
parents are ready to retire from the active duties the farm 
is usually turned over to one member of the family on a tenant 
basis, with the expectation that in time title to the farm will be 
secured by the tenant and he will become the owner of the farm. 
While tenancy is common at the present time and has been 
present in the United States since the beginning of our nation, it 
has ever been looked upon merely as a stepping stone, a 
temporary means of acquiring the use of land, and not as a 
permanent condition for any individual. The statistics show 
an increase in the percentage of tenancy, however, and it appears 
that, on the average, farmers grow older as tenants than they 
did when land values were lower. One important subject 
of consideration relates to the means of maintaining the move- 
ment from tenancy to ownership. This will receive especial 
consideration in a later chapter. In this chapter especial 
attention will be given to the methods of renting land with a 
view to the right use of the land and to the equitable distribution 
of the products of the land.
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Points to be considered in renting land. The first point to 
be considered by the landlord is the character of the tenant 
to whose care he is to commit his farm. Honesty is the first 
essential, without which the farm may be damaged within a 
year to an amount greater than the annual rent. 
Young men who desire to succeed as tenant farmers cannot 
have the importance of honesty too strongly impressed upon 
them. The efficient young man who is honest finds no difficulty 
in gaining control of land and capital, but no one with capital 
will have anything to do with a dishonest tenant if he knows him 
and can get any one else. -Many men do things which they 
count very shrewd, but which at once puts them in the class 
of men who have to be watched, and it is a general principle 
that the greater the risk the higher the rate of profit which 
the capitalist should demand. The honesty of the tenant in- 
sures the landlord against the losses he is in danger of sus- 
taining if the tenant is dishonest. The landlord can afford, and 
is usually willing, to pay a liberal premium for this insurance. 
Efficiency is equally important. If the farm is let on shares, 
the income of the landlord is dependent upon the efficiency of the 
tenant. If let for cash, it is much better to have a capable 
tenant who can pay the rent with ease, since the reputation of 
the farm depends upon the success of the tenant. Every tenant 
has a record, —look into this record before making a contract. 
The tenant should be in possession of a requisite amount of 
capital to operate the farm effectively. This amount will de- 
pend upon the type of farming and the form of tenure. It 
is a common practice for the landlord to supply a large 
proportion of the operating capital where he is assured of the 
honesty and efficiency of the tenant. It does not make so 
much difference who provides the capital, the important thing 
is that the capital certainly be provided. 
Tue FARM AND THE LANDLORD 
In choosing a farm, consider its suitability to the type of 
farming most congenial to the tenant, location with respect to 
markets, schools, etc., the qualities of the soil, the arrangement 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 273 
of the fields and buildings for economy of labor, the size of 
the farm, whether it will give full scope to the energy of the 
tenant, the water supply, and the sanitary conditions of the 
home. Ascertain if there has been any sickness in the family 
or disease among the animals of the former tenant. The fair- 
ness of the rent asked should be looked into by the tenant. 
By making inquiry of the outgoing tenant, the neighbors, the 
thrasher man, and the operator of the local creamery or cheese 
factory, the prospective tenant can get information on many 
of these points and at the same time ascertain the amount of 
the income, the expenditures, and other factors which will show 
the possibilities of the farm. 
The farm being found satisfactory, make sure that the land- 
lord is a fair-minded man, capable of giving good advice but 
not overfree with his suggestions nor overinsistent upon his 
own notions being followed in detail. A nagging landlord 
makes the day long and the work tiresome. 
|. The landlord should try to see the situation from the view- 
point of the tenant as well as his own and then strive to be 
fair. This will pay not only in the satisfaction that results 
from being decent with one’s fellow-men, but also in greater 
returns from the farm. The landlord who takes advantage of a 
tenant who is striving to do the right thing, and “ grinds him 
down,” may gain a few cents in the beginning, but he will 
lose dollars in the end. He will gain the reputation of being 
a grasping landlord. Good tenants will avoid him, for it is 
true not only that the efficient farmers tend to get the most 
productive land, but also that the honest tenant tends to get 
the honest landlord. 
What the lease should contain. The lease should contain a 
description of the land (the description found in the deed to the 
land), the buildings, and such other property belonging to the 
landlord as may be involved in the agreement. 
Uses of property. The uses and the limitations upon the 
uses to which the property may be put by the tenant should 
be stated specifically in the contract. For example, the land 
to be retained in permanent pasture should be described, the 
z 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  274 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
area to be kept in meadow stated, the crops which are not 
to be grown named, the uses named for which trees may be 
cut; etc. 
Disposition of products. It is through the regulation of 
what crops are to be produced upon the farm, and the forms 
in which the products of the farm are to be disposed of, that 
the farming may be directed along lines least exhausting to the 
soil. In general, tenant farmers are too much inclined to sell 
grain and hay rather than live stock and dairy products. This 
is partly due to the lack of capital on the part of tenant. Re- 
strictive clauses in leases which require that all hay, straw, corn 
fodder, corn, etc., be fed upon the farm should be accompanied 
with provisions enabling the tenant to secure the necessary 
animals to consume these products. 
Use of manure made on the farm. The manure made upon 
the farm, from feeds produced thereon, belongs to the land, 
and in no case should any tenant be allowed to remove this 
manure from the land. Danger from this source arises most 
commonly in the case of farmers who own a farm and hire ad- 
ditional land. Land leased in this way should receive its pro 
rata share of the manure. 
Contracts usually provide that the tenant shall spread all 
manure upon the land at such points as the owner shall direct. 
This clause is more or less useless, as a new tenant will gladly 
haul all the manure he can find, while a tenant who expects to 
leave before another cropping season cannot easily be forced 
to haul manure for his successor. The obvious remedy is to pay 
the tenant for hauling the manure from which he is to derive 
no benefit or else not expect him to perform this service. 
Purchase of feed and fertilizers. In order that the tenant 
be not discouraged in buying feeds and fertilizers to be utilized 
upon the farm the contract should provide for compensation to 
the tenant upon the termination of his lease for the unexhausted 
supplies of fertility placed in the soil from these sources. The 
payment for such improvements should never be for more than 
the benefit to be derived by the incoming tenant. Unwise 
expenditures should be the loss of him who makes them. 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  
  FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 275 
Destruction of noxious weeds. Great care should be taken 
to provide in the contract for the cutting of all noxious weeds 
before they mature their seeds. A clause should be inserted 
providing that in case the tenant neglects to destroy seed-bearing 
weeds in proper season the landlord may enter with the necessary 
help, destroy the weeds, and charge the cost to the tenant. 
In the case of Canada thistles and quack grass, provision 
should be made against the spreading of their roots over the 
fields. These plants may have got a start along a fence row or 
along a ditch where the land has not been cultivated for years. 
By plowing one furrow closer than has been the practice in a 
place of this kind a great quantity of the roots may be loosened 
and dragged out over the field. Danger of spreading these 
plants should be guarded against strenuously. The saving of 
the land from the encroachment of noxious weeds is even more 
important, if there be any difference, than the avoidance of soil 
exhaustion. 
Where a state law requires the destruction of noxious weeds 
it should be strenuously enforced. It is the duty of every 
landlord and of every tenant to see that such laws are obeyed. 
The landlord whose farm is foul with weeds should not ex- 
pect the tenant who was not to blame for this condition of affairs 
to clear the farm from these pests without compensation. 
Where this work is not performed as a part of the regular culture 
of the crops, the tenant should receive compensation in cash in 
proportion to the service rendered. The landlord who does not 
spend money in fighting the encroaching army of noxious weeds 
will soon accept a much lower rent. Where the destruction of 
weeds is a regular farm operation necessary to the production 
of a crop the tenant should not expect other compensation than 
that coming from increased production. The landlord whose 
farm is clear of weeds can easily secure enough more rent to 
make his activities and expenditures in the destruction of weeds 
very profitable. 
Value of a tidy farm. The landlord should take great care 
to provide neat farm buildings and fences. The tenant should 
agree to maintain a tidy appearance about the house, the barns, 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the feed lots, the fence rows, and every other part of the farm. 
There is a considerable advertising value in good appearances 
which should not be disregarded. Where it is not profitable in 
dollars and cents it pays abundantly in the satisfaction that 
comes from the greater degree of contentment and self-respect 
enjoyed by the farmer and his family. 
New buildings and fences. In the construction of new 
fences and buildings there seems to be no settled practice. In 
some cases the landlord provides the material, performs all of 
the work, and pays for the board of the workmen, the tenant 
hauling the material from the nearest station and boarding the 
workmen at a fixed rate. In other cases the tenant performs all 
of the unskilled labor and boards the skilled laborers without 
charge while making the improvement. 
Repairs on fences and buildings. The common practice in 
all forms of leases in the Northern States is for the landlord to 
furnish the material and the tenant to do all the work required 
in making ordinary repairs on fences and buildings. In some 
cases a distinction is made between the “ inside” fences and 
the outside or “ line fences,” the landlord making the repairs 
on the latter and the tenant doing the work required in making 
repairs on the former. 
Another plan which has been found more satisfactory in some 
instances is for the owner of the land to pay the tenant a fixed 
sum per day for time expended under the owner’s supervision 
in the construction and repair of fences and buildings and ad- 
justing the rent accordingly. This may result in a more cheerful 
service of the tenant in working on fences and buildings. 
Some experienced landlords require the tenants to make good 
at their own expense damages done to gates, barn doors, pumps, 
etc., where the wear and tear is likely to be very great with a 
careless tenant and very little with a careful one. The practice 
on some estates is for the landlord to furnish the parts of the 
pump and the windmill which are subject to little wear, and to 
require the tenant to furnish the wearing parts. This was sug- 
gested by the difficulty met with in getting tenants to oil the 
windmill. If the tenant owns the gearing and wheel of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
    FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 277 
windmill he is less likely to let the wheel run loose in a high 
wind or let it run for weeks at a time without oil. 
Fence posts. Where post timber is found in the farm wood- 
lot it is common practice for the tenant to make the posts needed 
for repairs. The main difficulty arises from the fact that tenants 
do not often make the posts early enough to give them time to 
season before they are put into the ground. The remedy 
suggested by one landlord is to keep a supply of posts on hand 
on the farm all the time and require the tenant to make, under 
the direction of the landlord, as many posts each year as he has 
found occasion to use. This problem is easily solved where the 
landlord looks after all repairs and pays the tenant for his 
labor in making repairs. 
Firewood. It is the common practice where there is a wood- 
lot on the farm, to allow the tenant to secure firewood free of 
charge. It is often prescribed that only dead and down timber 
may be taken for this purpose. In any case growing trees 
should not be cut until all dead timber has been taken. It is 
usually prescribed that all tops or slashings not taken for firewood 
shall be piled and burned by the tenant. 
The road tax. The general rule is for the tenant to work or 
pay the road tax. It is often stated that in return for this service 
the tenant shall be allowed to secure firewood from the farm, 
although in some cases where this latter privilege is not granted 
the tenant is required to work the road tax without any special 
compensation beyond the use he gets of the road. 
Duration of leases. There is perhaps more land let for 
one year at a time or from year to year, than on any other terms 
in the Corn Belt, and yet three-year leases and five-year leases 
are very common, and leases for two years and for four years 
have occasionally been noted. It is not uncommon to lease a 
farm for a period of three or five years, and then allow the tenant 
to remain on the farm from year to year after this period has 
elapsed, in case this is agreeable to both parties. Another 
method is to let the farm for one year with the agreement that 
if the parties are both satisfied with the arrangement the first 
year, the contract becomes good for two or four more years.
-P-A-G-E-290
278 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
It is generally agreed among landlords that a tenant will do 
better if he can plan to remain for three or five years, than if 
he is uncertain how long he may remain. One year is required 
for the tenant to become acquainted with the farm. 
On a dairy farm, where stock is let with the land, it is much 
better that the same man should have charge of the cows for 
a long period than for the tenants to be changing from year 
to year. In case the cows are owned in partnership it is very 
unsatisfactory to be dividing the herd every year. The follow- 
ing quotation from a letter from a Wisconsin farmer, who lets 
land on shares and furnishes a part of the stock, will help to 
put this matter in a clear light: 
“Tf I knew the man to be a good one, and one that would suit, I 
would prefer to let for a term of years, say from three to five years, 
as a man only gets started the first year, for he has the farm to learn, 
and it is not best to be changing stock every year. I think if a tenant 
knows this to be his home, he will take more interest in keeping up 
the place. But if you are not sure the man will suit, or be satisfied 
to stay, I should rent for one year, as it is very easy to continue the 
old contract or make a new one, as the case requires.” 
If there is any difference, there seems to be more reason for 
letting land for a number of years when let for cash than when 
on shares. It is thought that the tenant will take much better 
care of the land when he has it for a number of years. 
The system of crop rotation should be taken into account in 
determining the period of the lease, so that the tenant may have 
time to complete the rotation. It is a well-recognized fact that 
where the land is so operated as to prove most profitable in the 
long run, the tenant is required to make investments in the form 
of labor in improving the tilth of the soil, in hauling manure, and 
sowing grass seeds, on which he can realize the full return only 
after a number of years. For this reason it is thought best to let 
land for several years at a time. 
In Scotland this long ago led to the introduction of 19- and 
21-year leases, yet these very long-term leases have their objec- 
tionable features even in Scotland, where the land is held in 
large estates by rich men who have no thought of anything 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  
ee 
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 279 
else than letting their land to tenants. In the United States 
landowners are so generally retired farmers, whose farms are 
likely to be sold in the course of a few years to men who will 
farm their own land, that very long-term leases are out of the 
question. Compensation for unexhausted improvements is the 
remedy for many of the evils of short-term leases. 
Amount of rent to be paid. The rent of a farm is the price 
paid for its annual use either in the form of money or products. 
The amount which should be paid depends upon the usefulness 
of the land and the scarcity of farm land of the grade in question. 
It is not always an easy matter to ascertain exactly what the 
“square deal” is. The amount of rent which should be given 
for the use of the land varies with the fertility of the land, the 
local market prices of products, the distance and character of the 
roads to the markets, the length of the term, the restrictions 
under which the land is to be farmed, and the probability that 
the tenant will improve a farm or bring about its deterioration. 
In figuring on the amount which he can afford to pay, the 
tenant should compare the opportunities offered and the rents 
asked for as many farms as possible in order’ to select the farm 
which will enable him, after paying the rent and other expenses, 
to have left the largest possible returns for his own labor and 
capital. 
No tenant should sign a contract until he sees clearly sources 
of income over and above the amount of the rent, sufficient to ' 
pay all annual expenses for labor and equipment, support his 
family in accordance with the standards of the community, and 
leave a surplus. This surplus is the ground for hope of be- 
coming the owner of a farm. Every honest and efficient farmer 
will be able to make a surplus from which to save if he is on 
the right farm on the right terms. But this statement does 
not give ground for the belief on the part of every tenant who 
makes no surplus that his rent is too high. Before coming to 
such a conclusion let the tenant make sure that he is an efficient 
farmer. Let him compare his farming in every detail with 
that of other men who are making a surplus, and this, if care- 
fully done, will point to the true cause of the lack of profit,   
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
whether it be the terms of the contract or the methods of 
farming. 
The landlord should not be overzealous in driving a hard 
bargain. The landlord who drives the hardest bargain often 
finds himself beaten in the end. A farm, like a horse or a cow, 
is more or less attractive and more or less useful according as 
it is well or ill treated. Under proper management land may 
be made to increase in productivity. It is equally true that ill 
treatment may greatly reduce the fertility of the land. Ill 
treatment is the more to be feared for the reason that in this 
way a tenant may sometimes increase his profits for the one 
year. Hence the following quotations, from men who have 
had long experiences in letting farms, are in point: “If you 
try to get more than a fair rent, the tenant will take more 
than the difference out of the property ;” and again, “ Do not 
beat a tenant before he comes, or he will beat you afterwards ; 
give him a good ‘ lay,’ and in the long run it will pay you best; 
an honest, fair way will always win in the long run.” 
The tenant who makes the highest bid is not always the most 
profitable man to have on thefarm. Landowners have too often 
overlooked the importance of having a thorough understand- 
ing as to the way in which the land is to be used and the con- 
dition in which the land and the buildings are to be left at the 
end of the tenancy. A tenant can well afford to offer an extra 
high rent for the use of the land for a year or two if he is free 
to plow up the rich old pastures, produce the most exhausting 
crops, and take no care to leave the farm in condition for mak- 
ing a profit in the future. No landlord can afford to sacrifice 
his capital for the sake of reaping a high rate of interest on his 
investment for a short time. It is very important, therefore, 
that the conditions of farming should be such as will guarantee 
that the farm will be returned to the landlord in as good condi- 
tion as it was at the beginning of the tenancy. This is not a 
matter that can be provided for perfectly in the contract, even 
if the tenant gives bond. To have to appeal to the law to en- 
force one’s rights is always undesirable. It is better to take a 
smaller rent from a fair-minded man who can be trusted to 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
    FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 281 
do the right thing, than to take chances on a man of doubtful 
character. In European countries where state-owned lands are 
let to tenants the principle is well established that farms will 
not necessarily be let to the highest bidder. 
In share tenancy the ability of the tenant to manage a farm 
is a matter which should receive more attention on the part of 
the landlord than the exact terms of the contract. On a given 
farm, stocked in a given way, one tenant will be able to sell 
$3000 worth of products each year, and keep the farm in as 
good condition as another tenant who may not be able to sell 
more than $2500 worth of products. If the land is let for 
one-half of the proceeds, this will make a difference of $250 
in the income of the landlord. In order to get the better ten- 
ant, therefore, the landlord can afford to be liberal in making 
the bargain. Even where the share of the product to be re- 
ceived by the landlord is fixed by custom, there are many points, 
such as the landlord’s share of the poultry, the paying of the 
thrashing bill, the twine bill, the amount of free garden land, 
the free use of milk for the tenant’s family, the colts, the horse 
feed, etc., regarding which the landlord and the tenant must 
bargain. Here is the opportunity for the owner to be liberal 
and get a good tenant. 
Where land is let, in accordance with the customs of the dis- 
trict, for one-half of the proceeds, it is often more important 
to the tenant that he should look out for the best farm, owned 
by an agreeable and far-sighted landlord, than to stand out 
too strongly on any small matter of detail as to what the land- 
lord shall furnish. The same labor and capital may easily 
bring a return 20 per cent larger on one farm than on another in 
the same neighborhood, and this will more than compensate for 
being liberal in matters of detail. 
When the landlord seeks the best tenant he can get, and the 
tenant seeks the best farm he can get, the result is likely to 
be that the best tenant will be on the best land, and while the 
tenant profits by being on the better land, the landlord profits 
equally by having an excellent tenant on his farm. Large num- 
bers of farmers have mentioned this point, and they generally
-P-A-G-E-294
  282 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
agree that the best tenants do get the best rented farms, and 
that the inefficient tenants have to take what they can get, 
which is usually the more sterile or run-down farms. One land- 
lord expressed himself as follows on this point : 
“Tf you mean by the best tenant, the one who takes proper care of 
the soil, and then makes the most money, one year with another, the 
best tenants are on the best land. A good tenant gets a good farm, 
and he can holdit. The inefficient tenant is always looking for a farm 
and the landowners with good farms want only the best tenants; so 
the inefficient tenants are crowded to the poorer grades of land.” 
Time of paying rent. The lease should be most explicit as 
to when payment of rent is to be made. Where the land is let 
for a share of the proceeds, the common practice is to divide the 
money as soon as the sales are made. It is very common for 
the division to be made at the creamery or cheese factory, and 
one check is sent to the landlord and another to the tenant. 
Where land is let for cash, the practice varies widely, and yet 
there is a tendency to make the time of payment conform to 
the time when the tenant is likely to make sales. One-half at 
the middle of the year and the remainder at the end of the 
year is a common practice, with the modification that in the case 
of the last year of the tenancy all payments shall be made one 
month before the end of the year. Monthly payments are be- 
ing introduced on dairy farms which are let for cash. This 
conforms to the time of receiving payments for the milk and 
grows very naturally out of a change from the share system to 
the cash system on dairy farms. 
Guarantee that the rent shall be paid. In many of the North 
Central states, laws have been passed during recent years which 
declare that the landlord shall have a lien for his rent upon 
all crops grown upon the leased premises. In others there are 
no statutory laws providing for a landlord’s lien, although, of 
course, a lien can be created by agreement of the parties, if 
properly made, and it is quite common to have a clause in the 
lease which secures the payment of the rent. In some cases 
the owner of the land requires that all of the products shall 
remain his property until the rent is paid, and in some cases the 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  
ee ae 
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 283 
tenant is authorized by the landlord to market the products in 
sufficient quantity to pay the rent, after which he may dispose 
of the remainder of the produce as he pleases. In some cases 
the tenant gives a chattel mortgage to secure the payment 
of the rent. 
It is common for the landlord to remit a part of the rent in case 
of a great disaster over which the tenant had no control, and 
which makes it impossible to pay the rent from the year’s 
productions. This should become a well-established custom. 
Good customs do much to insure happy relations between land- 
lords and tenants. The best landlords realize that food for the 
family of an honest, industrious tenant should come before 
the landlord’s rent. Well-established customs impel the less 
well-disposed landlords to live up to the standards established 
by the better landlords. 
Enforcing the agreements. The lease should provide for en- 
forcing the contract. Fines are sometimes provided in case of 
failure to conform to the contract either by omission or com- 
mission. It is sometimes agreed that in case either party shall 
fail to perform his part in the agreement, as illustrated by an 
example of the destruction of weeds by the tenant or the making 
of an improvement by the landlord, the other party may hire a 
third party to carry out the terms of the agreement and charge 
the costs against the crop or against the rent, as the case may be. 
It should be provided in the agreement that. in case either 
party fails to perform his part, the tenancy may be brought to a 
close, by due notice, at the end of the current year. As a rule 
it is unwise to be strenuous in enforcing the terms of the contract. 
In case either party fails to perform his part in the contract to 
such an extent that appreciable loss results, it is better to bring 
the contract to a close. 
While a change usually results in some loss, it is better than 
tolerating excessive negligence. New agreements are better 
than old agreements. The landlord tries harder to please a new 
tenant than an old one. The new tenant operates under a new 
stimulus, his expectations are high, and his work moves with 
renewed energy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
    284 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Notice to terminate lease. Where land is let from year to 
year or for one, three, or five years, with the understanding that 
the tenant may remain as much longer as it is mutually agree- 
able, it is common to include a clause in the lease to the effect 
that (after the fixed period has elapsed) in case either party de- 
sires to bring the tenancy to a close at the end of the year, he 
must give the other party written notice to that effect ninety 
days (sometimes six months) prior to the end of the year. In 
the absence of any notice, the contract is to be considered 
renewed for another year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
    
CHAPTER XXIII 
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES (Continued) 
Share versus cash rent. Is it better to let land on shares 
or for cash? The answer to this question depends largely 
upon the amount of time the landlord can give to the supervision 
of the farm and to the amount of money and ability possessed 
by the tenant. The landlord who lets land on shares must give 
much attention to the management of the farm, but he who lets 
his land for cash need give little attention to the farm beyond 
the securing of the right tenant under proper agreements. 
Share tenancy usually yields larger returns to the landlord than 
cash tenancy, because he renders more service, takes more 
risk, and often furnishes more of the capital. 
The tenant with little capital and but little experience in 
farming finds share tenancy better than remaining a hired man. 
Compared with the cash tenant he is more dependent and may 
make less money, but if he lacks the capital and skill to succeed 
as a cash tenant he will find share farming under the supervision 
of a landlord who has been a successful farmer more profitable, 
as well as a more independent life, than working for wages. 
For many young farmers a period as share tenant under the 
supervision of a good landlord who is himself a successful farmer 
is a most valuable apprenticeship in farm management. 
Share tenancy. Share tenancy is more common than cash 
tenancy in the United States. In 1910 there were 1,399,923 
tenants whose entire rent was paid in the form of a share of 
the product or a share of the proceeds. There were 128,466 
who paid rent in the form of a share of the product and who paid 
a cash rent in addition usually for a part of the farm, the pro- 
ceeds of which were not shared with the landlord. There were 
712,294 tenants reported as paying a cash rent solely, but a 
285
-P-A-G-E-298
  286 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
very large part of these paid a fixed quantity of produce, for 
example a fixed amount of cotton is paid for a given area of 
cotton land, instead of a fixed amount of cash rent. 
Share tenancy is preferred by many tenant farmers because the 
risk is less than in cash tenancy. The thought of paying a fixed 
rent whether the crop is large or small and whether the prices 
are high or low is not attractive to the majority. And again, 
many of the tenants do not possess sufficient wealth to enable 
them to own all of the stock necessary to operate a farm on a 
cash basis. 
The landlords who live in close proximity to the land which 
they let, and who have time to devote to its supervision, usually 
prefer a share of the crop because they find it more profitable 
to them. The share system is more profitable to the landlords 
largely because of the close supervision which they give to the 
farms let on shares. Many of the tenants are young and in- 
experienced, and are willing to leave the general management 
of the farm to the landlord, who is very likely to be an elderly 
farmer, and the fact that he has a farm to let suggests that he 
has been a successful farmer. All tenants are not so willing 
to be directed by their landlords, but if they pay a share of the 
products as rent the landlord’s right to give advice is apparent 
and is a well-established custom, whereas under cash tenancy 
there has seemed to be less reason why the tenant should be 
compelled to accept interference on the part of the landlord. 
The principle being established that the landlord has a right 
to direct more or less definitely the operations of the farm, as in 
the case of share tenancy, the landlord has little difficulty in so 
directing the management of the farm as to preserve the fer- 
tility of the land. The choice of crops, and the organization 
of the field-system are subjects which the share tenant is usually 
willing to leave to the landlord, and in many cases the landlord 
controls the field operations in the minutest detail. For ex- 
ample, the depth to which land is to be plowed, the time of 
sowing, planting, harvesting, and the number of times a field 
of Indian corn should be cultivated are details to which the 
landlord often gives his attention under this system of letting 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 287 
land. The landlord is willing to exert himself for these purposes 
because his profits are increased by such activity. 
Another reason often given by landlords for preferring a share 
of the crop to a cash rent is that, in a country where most of the 
tenants have little wealth, a share of the product proves more 
profitable to the landlord, in the long run, because he shares 
the benefit of an extra large crop and gets something out of the 
smallest one, whereas in case he is receiving a fixed rent, the 
tenant gets all the advantage of an extra large crop, but in case 
of a crop failure the tenant is often unable to pay the fixed rent 
and the landlord has to stand the losses when the crops are 
short without getting the advantage of the extra large crops. 
Where the tenants are men of considerable wealth and can 
stand a loss from time to time this is a matter of less importance. 
Again, it is said that the collection of the rent is an easier 
matter where a share of the crop is given. ‘ Farmers will give 
a fifty cent chicken for a church dinner when they would not 
think of giving as much as twenty-five cents in cash,” says an 
Iowa farmer who has tried both systems, and he continues, 
“They will give the landlord his share of the farm products 
much more cheerfully than pay him cash.” 
The share rent adjusts itself to changes in the value of the 
products without any change in the contract. This is looked 
upon by some farmers and landlords as a reason of first impor- 
tance for adhering to the share system. 
Participation of the landlord in the management of the farm 
is the chief reason for the success of share tenancy in this country. 
This point has been emphasized over and over again in the 
communications received from men who are in a position to 
know. Share tenancy is, as a rule, more profitable to the land- 
lord only when the farm is under his immediate supervision. 
If the management must be left entirely to the tenant farmer, 
the cash system is usually preferable to the landlord. If the 
tenant is a capable manager, so that the supervision of the 
landlord adds nothing to the product, then it is better for the 
tenant to pay a fixed rent, if he has the capital to do so, and 
secure the extra profits due to his superior ability.

  288 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The methods of letting land on shares are so varied that a 
brief description of the forms of share tenancy is essential to an 
understanding of the subject. Share tenancies vary with 
respect to: 
(a) The proportion of the product received by each party. 
(6) The equipment and supplies furnished by each party. 
(c) The degree of control exercised by each party. 
These characteristics of the share systems of operating land 
will be described for the various parts of the United States 
under a classification based on the share received by the land- 
lord. The other characteristics will be discussed under sub- 
headings. 
The one-fourth system. One-fourth the product as the land- 
lord’s share is the lowest share rent which has been found to exist

in an important way in the United States. This system was 
found on the western edge of the wheat region of the Dakotas, 
Nebraska, and Kansas, and also in Oregon and California in 
the first decade of this century. In general it may be said that 
the one-fourth system existed in the North only on relatively 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 289 
unproductive lands. In the South the practice of giving the 
landlord one-fourth of the cotton crop was very common wher- 
ever white tenants engaged in cotton production. It was there 
most generally found in conjunction with a “ third ” system for 
the grain crops. It is common in the South to speak of the 
“third and fourth” system, which usually means that the 
landlord receives one-fourth of the cotton and one-third of the 
grain crops. 
In the “fourth” system the tenant usually furnishes all the 
equipment and seeds, but in case commercial fertilizer is used, 
as is sometimes the practice in the cotton country, the landlord 
pays one-fourth the cost. In the northern states the landlord 
often furnishes nothing but the bare land for one-fourth of the 
crop. 
Under the fourth system the tenant is usually left free to 
produce the crops as he pleases, the landlord exercising little 
control beyond the determination of the crops to be grown and 
the area of each. 
The one-third system. The one-third system is very common 
throughout the United States with the exception of the regions 
  
            
     
-P-A-G-E-302
  290 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of very high land values in the North Central states. Under 
this system the landlord receives one-third the grain and some- 
times he receives all the straw and corn stalks and stands none 
of the expense of production. 
The landlord receiving a third of the produce usually furnishes 
no part of the operating equipment of the farm. In many 
instances the tenant pays a cash rent for the house in which 
he lives and for pasture for his live stock. In many other cases 
fields only are rented for one-third the crop. The tenant lives 
on the land which he may have bought or leased and takes two- 
thirds the grain and leaves the roughage on the farm where 
grown. Where the “ third” system exists with respect to grain 
crops, the hay crop is usually shared half and half. 
Where land is let for one-third the crop, the landlord usually 
controls in detail the kind of crops to be grown on each field. 
Beyond this he leaves the tenant to do much as he pleases. 
The two-fifths system. In the Corn Belt the two-fifths system 
has been an intermediate stage in the rise of share rents from

" one-third to one-half the crop. This system differs from the 
“third” system primarily in the fact that the landlord receives
-P-A-G-E-303
  
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 291 
two-fifths of the grain, straw, and corn fodder, and the tenant 
receives three-fifths. The system is usually the same as the 
one-third system so far as what the landlord furnishes is con- 
cerned and also with regard to control. 
The half-share system. The letting of land for one-half the 
product is found in all parts of the United States. The half- 
and-half system varies greatly with respect to what the landlord 
furnishes in addition to the land and buildings. 
Grain farming on the half system. In one form of half-share 
tenancy found in the grain regions of Minnesota, Kansas, 
  
    
    
  FicurE 21 
Nebraska, the Dakotas, and in the wheat regions of the Pacific 
coast, the landlord furnishes the seed grain and gets one-half 
the crop. In these regions it is often counted that one-half the 
crop, when the landlord furnishes the seed and pays for one- 
half the time and threshing, is equivalent to one-third the crop 
where the landlord does not furnish the seed. 
In central Illinois and in west-central Indiana the landlord 
who receives one-half the grain crops furnishes nothing but the 
land and buildings and exacts a cash rent for the land used      
-P-A-G-E-304
292 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
for hay and pasture. The exacting of a cash rent for hay and 
pasture land often accompanies the share system in the North 
Central states, where the landlord receives one-third or two- 
fifths, as well as where he receives one-half of crop. In the 
South, corn land is sometimes let for cash, while cotton land is 
let on shares. In central Illinois, the landlord sometimes 
demands half the grain and one dollar per acre in addition, and 
it is the regular thing to require that the tenant deliver the 
landlord’s share of the grain at the nearest market at such time 
as the landlord may desire to dispose of his share of the product. 
It is in the heart of the Corn Belt of central Illinois that the land- 
lords are able to make the heaviest demands upon their tenants. 
In eastern Ohio, in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and some adjoin- 
ing territory where wheat has long been considered central in the

farming system, the landlord who receives one-half the grain 
usually lets the tenant have the use of the buildings, the hay and 
pasture land and all the straw he cares to feed on the farm, 
without any additional compensation. This custom is held 
to rather tenaciously and in one instance the writer found a 
tenant who was making about one hundred dollars a month 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
    FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 293 
from his dairy. This was appreciably more than the entire 
value of the grown crops, yet the landlord continued to accept 
one-half the grain and let the tenant have all he made out of 
the dairy. s 
The land-and-stock share system. Another form of the half- 
and-half system is the land-and-stock share system, in which the 
landlord furnishes a part of the live stock or owns a half interest 
in all or a part of the livestock. This system is most common 
in the dairy regions of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, 
Iowa, and Minnesota. The variations are numerous, but the 
system has many features which are in general use. 
The landlord furnishes the land and the buildings including 
the house for the tenant. The tenant furnishes the horses, 
tools, and machinery, and all the labor required to operate the 
farm. The landlord and tenant own, jointly, the cattle, hogs, 
and poultry kept on the farm. The items of expenses are 
likewise in three classes. The landlord furnishes material for 
making repairs and the tenant performs the work, unless a 
skilled workman is required, in which case the landlord pays for 
the mechanic. The tenant stands all expenses in keeping his 
horses, tools, and machinery in working order. Expenses for 
twine, thrashing, silage cutting, etc., are usually shared equally. 
The dairy equipment is often owned jointly. This refers 
especially to the cream separator and shipping cans. A common 
variation of this system is for the landlord to furnish all the 
cows. This is more or less common on the less valuable dairy 
farms of Wisconsin and is often found in New York. 
The land-and-stock share method of letting land has been 
in use in the United States for more than a hundred years. 
During this time a large number of questions with regard to 
the duties and privileges of landlords and tenants have arisen. 
It may be beneficial, therefore, to take up these questions one 
by one, and indicate the way in which they have been answered. 
Ownership of the partnership property. Where the landlord 
agrees to furnish half of the live stock and the tenant the other 
half each party should own an undivided half interest in the 
stock. A partnership herd, for example, in which the tenant
-P-A-G-E-306
  294 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
owns 12 certain cows and the landlord 12 other certain cows is 
sure to give rise to trouble. There should be a description of 
all partnership property possessed at the time the contract takes 
effect, and an agreement as to the number of cows to be kept, 
the number of pigs reared, etc. 
At the beginning of the tenancy the stock which each party 
wishes to put into the partnership should be carefully appraised 
and the difference in value settled in cash. This means that 
the landlord buys a half interest in the tenant’s cows, hogs, 
chickens, etc., and the tenant buys a half interest in the cows, 
hogs, chickens, etc., placed on the farm by the landlord. 
Where the landlord furnishes all of the cows, provision must 
be made for maintaining the herd by replacing old cows with 
young ones produced upon the farm. The money received for 
the cow sold is divided and the young cow reared by the tenant 
becomes the property of the landlord. 
Description of property furnished by tenant. It is the most 
common practice for the tenant to furnish the teams, tools, 
and machinery. The income of the landlord is influenced by 
the character of these equipments. Hence there should be a 
written agreement as to how many horses are to be kept and 
the kinds of tools and machinery, to be used. Especial care 
should be taken to have an understanding regarding the manure 
spreader, the silage cutter, the cream separator and any other 
equipments which may be needed on the farm but which are 
not commonly found in the tenant’s outfit. 
Description of labor to be employed upon the farm. It has 
always been the rule to have in the lease a careful descrip- 
tion of the land. In share tenancy it is equally important 
to have a careful description of the labor supply to be fur- 
nished by the tenant. Where land is let on the land-and-stock 
share system it is common to speak of the arrangement as a 
partnership in which the labor balances the land. It is obvious, 
therefore, that some more or less definite amount and quality of 
labor should be agreed upon. This agreement is desirable for 
the reason that the interest of the landlord leads him to desire 
a large amount of labor on his land, whereas the interest of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-307
    FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 295 
tenant leads him to cut down too much on the labor bill. Trouble 
can be avoided by agreeing in advance upon the amount of labor 
to be provided by the tenant. 
Horse feed. Where the tenant furnishes all of the horses 
to operate the farm, which is the most common practice, the 
question has arisen as to whether these horses should be fed from 
the undivided grain and hay or from the tenant’s share of the 
grain. This has generally been settled in southern Wisconsin 
in favor of feeding the horses from the undivided grain and 
hay. In some districts, where grain farming is an important 
adjunct to dairy farming, the landlord furnishes all of the seed 
grain, and the tenant is required to feed his horses from his 
share of the grain, but may feed them from the undivided hay. 
Where special circumstances give rise to opportunities for 
the profitable employment of the tenant’s horses in hauling 
stone or some other materials, landlords have sometimes ob- 
jected to such employment, but this outside work should be dis- 
couraged only to the extent that it may encroach upon time re- 
quired properly to perform the farm work. The tenant should 
furnish the grain fed to the horses during the time they are 
employed on outside work of this kind. In general, it is better 
for the landlord to let land for cash where there is regular 
opportunity for outside employment. This opportunity will 
enable the tenant to pay a higher rent than he could otherwise 
pay. This point should not be overlooked by the landlord. 
Colts raised by tenant. Where the horses have been fed 
from the undivided grain, the question has arisen as to the 
ownership of the colts in case any should be raised. It is 
contended by the landlord that if the colts eat undivided grain 
there should be some method of remunerating the landlord. It 
is also claimed that brood mares require more feed per unit 
of work performed on the farm than do other horses, and for 
this reason the landlord should have an interest in the colts. 
On the other hand, it is claimed that considerable risk is taken 
by the tenant where colts are raised and that if the landlord 
does not share this risk he should not share the colts. 
This problem has been solved in various ways. In many
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
cases the difficulty has been avoided by raising no colts. In 
some cases the amount of feed consumed by the colts has been 
accounted for. This is not a very satisfactory method. In 
other cases the expenses involved in the rearing of the colts 
have been shared equally and the colts have been the common 
property of landlord and tenant. Where this practice is fol- 
lowed the landlord should stand the entire charge for stallion 
service to balance the risk taken by the tenant. In still other 
cases this problem has resulted in the landlord owning a half 
interest in the horses. Where horse breeding is to be any 
important part of the farm this is the best plan. 
Poultry. The most approved method is to own the poultry 
in partnership, feed it from the undivided grain, and divide the 
proceeds. In some instances the tenant is allowed what poultry 
and eggs he desires for home consumption, and where sales 
are made the proceeds are divided. In other agreements the 
landlord is to receive an amount of eggs and poultry equal to 
that consumed by the tenant, and the remainder sold and the 
proceeds divided. 
Thrashing and twine bills. The thrashing bill is usually 
shared equally by landlord and tenant, but landlords do not so 
generally share the twine bill, yet on a very large share of the 
farms the landlord has found it necessary to agree to pay one- 
half of the twine bill in order to secure the tenant desired. 
Corn shredder, silage cutter, etc. In recent years the intro- 
duction of the corn shredder, the silage cutter, and the corn 
binder has brought new problems. These machines are not in 
use on all farms, and where they are used there is no settled 
practice as to who shall pay the bills. This is a point on which 
the parties use their bargaining power. It is here argued, for 
example, that the shredder saves the labor of the tenant, and 
that the tenant should pay the shredder bill. On the other 
hand, the landlord has to admit that the use of the shredder 
results in better care of the fodder, and leaves the manure in 
much more desirable form to be spread upon the land. 
Terms gradually improved for tenanis. During the last 50 
years the conditions of this form of share tenancy have, on
-P-A-G-E-309
  FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 297 
the whole, become more favorable to the tenant. In the earlier 
days, when the butter and cheese were made on the farms, the 
labor was performed by the tenant, or, more often, by his 
wife. The introduction of the creamery and the cheese factory 
has relieved the farmer’s wife of this task, and the expense of 
manufacturing these products in the creamery or the cheese 
factory has been shared equally by landlord and tenant. 
Management of the farm. The landlord usually participates 
in the management of the farm where the land-and-stock 
share system is in use. This custom arises naturally out of the 
fact that the landlord has a very large investment and is de- 
pending upon the management of this property for his income. 
On the other hand, the tenant is usually a young man, of much 
less experience than his landlord and finds it profitable if not 
always agreeable to his own feelings to be guided by the experi- 
ence of the older man. 
It is usually stated in the agreement that the farm shall be 
managed by mutual agreement of the landlord and the tenant. 
It seems to be generally conceded by the tenant farmers that 
where land is let on shares the landlord has a right to participate 
in the management. 
Sharing the proceeds. The landlord and the tenant share 
equally the proceeds of all sales and all increments and decre- 
ments in the value of all partnership property. The division 
of income should be made at once upon its receipt where large 
sales are made. Small items should be settled once a month. 
It is common, where milk is delivered to a butter or cheese 
factory, to have separate checks made out for the landlord and 
for the tenant so that no occasion for trouble may arise in 
making the division. 
Division of partnership property at termination of lease. 
The most favored system seems to be that of requiring the 
tenant to divide the partnership stock of each kind into two 
equal groups. Where the units are large, as in the case of the 
dairy herd, it is common to balance small differences with a 
fixed amount of cash. For example, if after every combina- 
tion has been tried one bunch is thought by the tenant to be 
   
-P-A-G-E-310
  298 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
worth $20 more than the other, it is agreed that the person 
taking the more valuable herd shall pay to the other $10 or 
half the difference. 
The tenant having made a division of each kind of stock, 
either of two methods may be used in determining which group 
will be left for the landlord and which taken by the tenant. 
One method is to draw lots. This method is good because the 
tenant, knowing he stands an equal chance of getting either 
group, will strive to make the groups of equal value. It is 
even permissible under this system to have the landlord assist 
in making the divisions. 
Another method of determining which group the tenant shall 
take is to let the landlord have his choice of the groups arranged 
by the tenant. This is a less satisfactory arrangement for the 
reason that the tenant knows the record of the cows better than 
the landlord, and where this plan is followed it is possible to 
get the more profitable cows into one bunch and the better ap- 
pearing cows in the other in such a manner as to make the 
tenant reasonably sure to get the more profitable cows. 
Another system of making a division of the jointly owned 
property is for the landlord and the tenant to take turn about 
in choosing from the herd or flock. This plan has been objected 
to on the ground that the party who is the better judge of live 
stock, or who may be the more familiar with the live stock, has 
a decided advantage over the other party. 
Still another system is to have the live stock appraised by dis- 
interested parties and the interest of one party purchased by 
the other. Where the landlord and the tenant fail to agree upon 
any other method, a public sale may be called and the live 
stock put up at auction. 
Croppers. The form of half-share tenancy found in the cotton 
and tobacco regions of the United States requires no capital on 
the part of the tenant. The landlord furnishes the land, 
buildings, teams, tools, and other equipment, and often advances 
the tenant enough goods, money, or credit to live on while 
“making ” the crop. The tenant, or cropper as he is commonly 
called in the South, furnishes the labor required to produce 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
    
. FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 299 
and harvest the crop. The cotton cropper receives one-half 
the value of his crops and free house rent and garden as pay for 
his efforts. In many of the cotton regions the cropper is not 
an independent operator. This is especially the case on the 
rich cotton lands where the plantation is the effective means of 
organizing and controlling a class of tenants who are differ- 
entiated from wage hands principally by the fact that they 
receive a share of the crop instead of a fixed wage. The system 
of control on a typical cotton plantation in the Yazoo delta of 
Mississippi has been described as follows: + 
“While there are some small holdings, a large proportion of the 
land is cultivated under a plantation system, white overseers manage 
the plantation and direct the cultivation from seedtime until the 
cotton is ready for market. The plantations are cut up into tracts 
varying somewhat in size, but usually from eighteen to forty acres 
in extent; on each tract is a cabin of two or four rooms and a ‘lean-to’ ; 
at a little distance is a cotton house for storing seed cotton during 
the picking season. Around or back of each cabin is usually a patch 
of ground, perhaps half an acre, for a garden, often inclosed by a 
paling fence, which serves as firewood in the winter season. Each 
house is occupied by one or two families, who cultivate the allotted 
land about the house, either as renters or croppers. 
“The cropper works like any wage laborer; and the daily routine 
has a distinct flavor of the ante-bellum plantation régime. The bell 
is rung at daylight during the cultivating season, the negroes gather 
at the lot where the mules of the plantation have been penned and 
fed during the night; each one receives his mule from the caretaker, 
and if he needs a new implement he gets it from the implement store- 
house upon order from the manager; he brings it back when he has 
finished using it. Each man works with his family in his own lot; 
the overseer endeavors to visit each lot twice a day to see that the 
cropper is working and to direct him in his work, set his tasks, and 
instruct him in their performance. At noon, the bell rings again, 
the mules are brought in, fed by a man in charge, and taken out 
after the nooning is over. At sunset, or a little later, the plantation 
bell rings again, the negroes stop work, and the mules are brought 
to the common lot to be fed and shut up for the night. From first 
to last every bit of work is supervised, the culture planned, the 
1In unpublished manuscript prepared by A. E. Conce. 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
300 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
amount and area of crop dictated by the overseer, the cotton picked, 
ginned, and baled under supervision, the corn harvested and housed, 
the produce divided, the indebtedness deducted, and the balance 
turned over without a word on the part of the cropper. 
“Mules are kept in a common lot simply to insure good feed and 
care, and to prevent their being ridden at night or on Sundays and 
holidays by the negro. When the cropper’s lot is at some distance 
from the mule lot and he is a reasonably careful man, the mule re- 
mains in his charge from Monday morning until Friday night or 
Saturday noon, when it is brought back again to the mule lot. This 
one item of plantation management has been a source of great saving 
both in efficient work and good‘work stock to the planter and fruitful 
cause of the change from share to fixed rent on the part of the negro.”   
“ The cropper,” often called “ halves ” in the upland counties, 
is usually found working on a verbal contract with a small land- 
owner or a credit merchant who has a large number of farms in 
his possession. Ifa merchant is his landlord, he is under super- 
vision from March to December. ‘‘ We oversee all our share 
hands,” said a Holly Springs merchant who owns thousands of 
acres in Marshall and Lafayette Counties, “ we don’t ‘ suggest” 
or ‘ stipulate ’ — we ‘ dictate’ what crops they shall raise, and 
where they shall raise them. We require cotton mostly, but 
we insist that they raise sufficient corn and fodder to feed our 
mules during the winter season, from January 1 to April 1, 
when we keep them in our own lots.” The supervision is not 
nearly so close as on the large plantation; a ‘“‘riding boss” gets 
around to each farm two or three times a week and notes the 
needs and condition of the crop. But the share hand makes 
his own hours of labor, has command of the mule furnished him, 
and is really very much freer to come and go, to work and “lay 
off” than the cropper of the bottom lands. When the landlord is 
a small owner, or lives at some distance, the oversight is still 
less. The land is less fertile, more must be tilled to make a 
fair crop, the tools furnished are less modern than those of the 
large planter, the mules are less valuable, and the resulting culti- 
vation is very poor. Many owners live in town some miles distant 
from their lands and take very little care of the share hand’s crop. 
   
-P-A-G-E-313
  
  FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 301 
The two-thirds system. Somewhat similar to the upland 
cropping system is a system found here and there throughout 
the northern part of the United States which may be called the 
two-thirds system. Under this system the landlord furnishes 
everything but the labor and receives two-thirds of the proceeds, 
while the tenant, or share hand, as he is more properly called, 
furnishes all the man labor and receives one-third of the pro- 
ceeds of the farm. While this system is found widely scattered, 
it is not believed to be very common. 
Cash tenancy. In 1910 there were only about half as 
many cash tenants as share tenants in the United States. 
While cash tenancy is common in the Corn Belt it is most com- 
mon in certain parts of the Cotton Belt. Cash tenancy and negro 
tenancy are found in the same regions. In the Cotton Belt of 
Texas and in the northern part of Georgia, where white 
tenants prevail, share tenancy is dominant. When it is further 
noted that most of the so-called cash rent among negroes is 
paid in the form of a fixed amount of cotton without regard 
to its cdsh value, it will become evident that actual cash rent 
is a minor form of tenancy in the United States at the present 
time. 
Landlords who live too far from their land or are too busy to 
give it the needed supervision for making share tenancy a suc- 
cess, usually prefer to let their farms for a cash rent. It is 
claimed by many landlords that the tenants devote much greater 
care to their farming under the cash system of letting land. 
The feeling that every extra bushel of grain and every extra 
fork of hay is all his own will naturally make the tenant more 
painstaking than he would be if only a part of these products 
were to be added to his own profits. 
This desire to obtain as large a return as possible is, at the 
same time, the greatest source of trouble in adjusting the rela- 
tions between landlords and tenants. The tenant who has a 
contract for but one year is inclined to look too strictly to 
securing as large a profit as possible for that one year, without 
any regard to the future. As a result of this short-sighted 
economy, too large a proportion of the land is often devoted
-P-A-G-E-314
er re ne eee ree 
302 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
to exhausting crops, and the larger profit of the one year is 
obtained at the expense of the profits of future years. 
By proper regulations with respect to the proportion of the 
land which shall be devoted to certain crops, this difficulty 
can be more or less successfully overcome, but such regulations 
are always annoying to the tenants. The granting of a lease 
for several years is thought by many to be all that is necessary 
to meet the difficulties arising from the short-sightedness of 
the tenants, but many landlords object to making a contract 
for a period of any great length. With all the difficulties which 
may beset this system, cash tenancy is preferable to share 
tenancy whenever the management of the farm is to be left 
almost entirely to the tenant, and where agriculture is extensive 
and the use of commercial fertilizers is unknown the letting of 
land for cash is a fairly successful method. 
Where intensive culture and the use of commercial fertilizer 
have become necessary the tenant problem takes on a more acute 
form. If we would study to advantage the problems which 
arise under these conditions, we must turn our attention to an 
older country than our own, where the tenant problem has been 
a more serious one, and whence we may learn from the experience 
of others the remedies which are fast becoming necessary to 
good relations between landlords and tenants in this country. 
The experience of England shows that the compensation for 
: unexhausted improvements is more successful than long leases 
asa means of solving the problem of good farming by cash tenants. 
This system will be considered in detail in a later chapter. 
Where land is let for cash rental the management of the 
farm falls definitely to the tenant. For this reason there is 
believed to be more occasion for restrictions in cash leases than 
in share contracts where the landlord is joint manager with the 
tenant. 
Restrictions have not been numerous in American cash leases, 
but in Wisconsin for example, the following are restrictive 
clauses which have been found : 
1. Specified parts of the farm shall not be plowed but shall 
be kept in permanent pasture. 
   
-P-A-G-E-315
  
    
FORMS OF LAND TENURE IN THE UNITED STATES 303 
2. A-specified number of acres shall be kept in meadow, and 
old meadow shall not be plowed up until an equal area of new 
meadow has been successfully seeded. 
3- No flax shall be grown. 
Only . . . acres of tobacco may be grown. 
Only . . . acres of cabbage may be grown. 
No straw or fodder shall be sold from the place. 
No hay shall be sold from the farm. 
Instead of 6 and 7 another lease requires that enough 
stock be kept to consume all the grain and forage crops produced 
upon the farm. 
g. Live stock shall not be allowed in the fields while the frost 
is going out of the ground. 
ro. Hogs shall be provided with nose rings in such a manner 
as will keep them from rooting up the turf when allowed in 
the pastures or fields. a Gone se 
Such restrictions, it will at once be seen, are intended to force 
the tenant into a conservative type of farming. The danger is 
that such restriction may so fetter the tenant as to make his 
farming unprofitable. 
It has been stated most emphatically by an English authority 
upon this subject that ‘no landlord who is determined to in- 
troduce unreasonable and unnecessary conditions into his leases 
is entitled to or can expect to get first-class tenants... . 
There is no difficulty in getting inferior tenants to agree to any 
stipulated terms of management, but great caution is necessary 
in laying restrictions upon really good farmers.... The 
art of farming is progressive and cannot be fettered by any 
set of rules that are meant to be of universal and unvarying ap- 
plication. Hence, all the terms of farm leases should in one 
respect be of a most general kind. A good tenant ought not to 
be tied down with restrictions which can only be of service to 
the landlord in enabling him to prevent a bad farmer from 
injuring the land.” 
In this country, where cash tenants have been put under few 
restrictions, as in the eastern counties of Wisconsin, the re- 
sults have been on the whole vnsatisfactory. Cash-rented farms
-P-A-G-E-316
  304 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
are not, as a rule, so well kept up as farms which are let on 
shares. This is due in part to the fact that the owner is more 
interested in keeping up the buildings and fences on the farm 
where his income depends directly upon the annual value of the 
products, but where land is let for one year at a time, the cash 
tenant is interested in securing the largest possible profit for 
that one year, without regard to the condition in which the land 
may be left. Cash tenants have too commonly neglected to 
sow clover seed, to produce and spread large quantities of ma- 
nure upon the farm, and to destroy noxious weeds. 
The demand is for a system of renting land which will avoid 
the evils of soil robbery without the evils of too great restriction.

    CHAPTER XXIV 
THE DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 
Two hundred years ago landownership on the part of farmers 
was common in England, but by 1900 it was very fare. 
According to the estimates compiled by Gregory King, there 
were 180,000 landowning farmers and 150,000 tenant farmers 
in England in 1688. Ownership did not in all cases mean the 
same in England at that time that it does in the United States 
to-day. A man was classed as an owner if he paid about two- 
thirds the value of a piece of land for the right to the free use of 
the land so long as any one of three persons named in the lease 
lived. This was said to be leased out on lives. Again, there 
were copyhold tenures which gave a perpetual right to the use 
of the land with the provision, however, that certain payments 
—which frequently became nominal in amount — were made 
to the manorial lord from time to time in accordance with the 
customs of the manor. The tenure was permanent, and where 
all these payments were brought together and compared with a 
regular annual rent, they were very oftensmall. It is fair to say, 
therefore, that toward the close of the seventeenth century more 
than half the farmers of England belonged to the landowning 
class. 
In 1900, 86 per cent of all the land under crops and grasses 
in England was occupied by tenant farmers; while slightly 
less than 14 per cent was occupied by owners, but the owners 
were generally the great landlords, not landowning farmers. 
By making close inquiry while passing through more than half of 
the counties of England in 1899, the writer found a scattering 
few who owned the land which they cultivated, but such farmers 
were extremely rare. The greater part of the land designated 
as “ occupied by owners ” was composed of the “‘ home farms ” 
x 395
-P-A-G-E-318
  306 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of landlords, and of farms which they had not been able to let 
since the depression. In this way the Duke of Grafton occupied 
five farms besides his home farm, in 1899. The five farms 
aggregated five thousand four hundred and ninety acres. Each 
one of these farms, as well as the home farm, had a bailiff 
(manager) upon it. There were more than seventeen thousand 
(17,189) farm bailiffs in England according to the census of 1891. 
Tenant farmers who keep bailiffs are very rare. The vast 
majority of these bailiffs were, doubtless, operating land which 
is recorded in the Agricultural Returns as “‘ occupied by owners.” 
Hence “ occupied by owners ” quite generally indicates a lower 
status of the farmer than that of the tenant farmer, though in 
some instances it indicates land cultivated directly by the 
owner. Kent was a county noted for her landowning farmers in 
the years gone by, but in 1898 it was stated that “ the small 
landowners have in most instances been compelled to sell their 
land, and the yeoman of Kent has practically disappeared.” 
To-day practically all the farmers in England lease the land 
which they occupy. The young man becomes a tenant farmer 
with the expectation of remaining such all his life. When 
money has been saved he looks for a larger farm where he may 
employ his surplus funds, but very rarely does he even think 
of investing in land. To an American this seems strange, 
and raises two important questions: First, what forces were 
operating in England to bring about so complete a disappearance 
of the landowning farmer? Second, what has been done in Eng- 
land to make tenant farming a satisfactory life for the farmer? 
The first of these questions will be discussed in this chapter, 
and the second will be discussed in the chapter on methods of 
adjusting the relation of landlord and tenant in England. 
Many of the small landowning farmers disappeared as a 
result of improvements in the methods of farming during 
the eighteenth century. The names of Jethro Tull and 
Charles Townshend are associated with movements most 
significant in the history of English agriculture. These great 
agriculturists carried on their important experiments during 
the second quarter of the eighteenth century. With the name of 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 307 
Tull should be associated the word tilth; and the fact that his 
contemporary was called “ Turnip Townshend ” suggests at once 
the phase of agricultural improvement in which he was interested. 
Tull, in his “ Horse-Hoeing Husbandry,” emphasizes the 
importance of pulverizing the soil. ‘The chief art of hus- 
bandry is to feed plants to the best advantage,” says Tull, 
and he believed that, in the feeding of plants, tillage is much 
more important than the application of fertilizers. He devotes 
one chapter of the book to the “ Pasture of Plants.” In this 
chapter he emphasizes the importance of dividing the soil into 
fine particles in order that the plants may find “ pasture” 
for their roots. The important field crops of the time were 
all sown broadcast, so that it was difficult, if not impossible, to 
cultivate the crops while growing, and the only chance of giving 
tilth to the soil other than in preparing the seed bed was during 
the fallow year. To surmount this difficulty, Tull invented a 
drill, for the sowing of all kinds of grain and roots, in order 
that these crops could be cultivated between the rows while 
growing. He also invented a horse hoe with which to cultivate 
the drilled crops. 
The name of Townshend is most closely associated with the 
introduction of turnips and clover into England, and with the 
reorganization of the English field system. The introduction 
of turnips, which could be cultivated while growing much more 
satisfactorily than could the small grains, enabled the farmers 
to dispense with the fallow wherever this crop would thrive. 
As the production of a crop of roots did not require a great 
deal more labor than caring for a bare fallow, it was only neces- 
sary that an increased demand for beef and muttons should 
increase the value of fodder crops sufficiently, in order that 
turnips should be very generally introduced. Upon the intro- 
duction of roots and clover, the old three-field system of crop 
rotation was replaced by the “ Norfolk four-course system,” 
which consisted of a root crop, followed by spring grain with 
which clover and grass seeds were sown; and the third year the 
hay crop was removed in time to plow the land for sowing wheat 
or rye.
-P-A-G-E-320
308 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
To the names of Tull and Townshend should be added that of 
Bakewell — the third member of the trinity of great men 
whose names have been most closely associated with “ the new 
agriculture in England.” Bakewell flourished at Dishley, in 
Leicestershire, from 1760 to 1795, and produced the necessary 
complement to good culture and fodder crops, namely, a breed 
of mutton-producing sheep and a breed of beef-producing cattle. 
This “ new agriculture ” is of interest here because it led to 
an increase in the size of farms, and to the inclosure of the 
common fields, both of which movements had a marked influence 
upon the status of the landowning farmers. In the agricultural 
literature of the early part of the eighteenth century, one reads 
of the great benefits to be derived from the inclosure of the 
common-fields for the purpose of adopting the new agriculture ; 
and these inclosures often involved the buying out of small 
freeholders who held rights over the commons along with the 
lords of the manors. Laurence, who wrote in 1727, taught with 
emphasis that “ A Steward should not forget to make the best 
inquiry into the disposition of any of the freeholders within or 
near any of his lord’s manors to sell their lands, that he may use 
his best endeavors to purchase them at as reasonable a price as 
may be for his lord’s advantage and convenience. Some instances 
there have been of stewards, who, after they have made haste 
to be rich, have made these inquiries for their own sakes, and 
have purchased out the freeholders, thereby making an estate 
for themselves, even within their own lord’s manors; insomuch 
that sometimes I have known it so ordered that the lord’s 
tenants have been called to do suit and service at his own [the 
steward’s] court. But, for the sake of honor and honesty, I 
hope these instances are rare; and so I content myself to have 
given this hint, still persuading the vigilant steward to be zealous, 
for his lord’s sake, in purchasing all the freeholders out as soon 
as possible especially in manors where improvements are to be 
made by inclosing commons and common-fields; which (as every 
one, who is acquainted with the late improvement in agri- 
culture, must know) is not a little advantageous to the nation 
in general, as well as highly profitable to the Undertaker.” __ 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 309 
  The writer has not found evidence showing any great progress 
in this direction until later in the eighteenth century, but there 
is reason for believing that Laurence’s advice was acted upon 
many times during the next sixty years. In 1786 Marshall 
records in detail an inclosure where the proceedings seem to have 
been in exact accordance with this advice.! 
Contemporaneous with the new agriculture, and perhaps it 
is not too much to say making the new agriculture necessary 
and possible, was the enormous growth of English manufactures 
and commerce. These lines of development greatly increased 
the demand for agricultural products so that by the end of the 
eighteenth century the price of such products had greatly risen. 
The high prices which could be obtained for the products of the 
farm gave high values to land and made larger farms and 
intensive culture extremely profitable. It required a great deal 
of capital to stock a large farm and cultivate it in accordance 
with the new methods. To own both land and capital required 
relatively great wealth; and the rural economists of the time 
advised farmers to use their capital in stocking large farms 
rather than to invest nearly all they had in buying land, in 
which case the farms would be too small and too poorly stocked 
to be most profitable. It came to be the argument that, whereas 
a farmer could realize no more than 3 per cent on investments 
1“Tn the parish of Felbrigg, in Norfolk, some seven or eight years ago, Mr. 
Wyndhan, who is Lord of the Manor, was also the sole proprietor in this parish, 
excepting one small farm, of seventy pounds a year, belonging to a young man, a 
yeoman, just come of age. An extensive, heathy waste, and some common-field 
lands, were desirable objects of inclosures; consequently, the possession of this 
young man’s estate became an object of importance to Mr. Wyndham. Steps 
were accordingly taken towards obtaining the desired possession; not, however, 
by threats and subterfuges, too commonly but very impolitically made use of upon 
such occasions; but by open and liberal proposals to the young man, the joint 
proprietor; who was made fully acquainted with the intention; and frankly told 
that nothing could be done without his estate. He was, therefore, offered, at once, 
a specific and considerable sum, over and above its full value to any other person; 
and, to insure the object in view, he had, at the same time, an offer made him of a 
considerable farm, on advantageous terms. The young man being enterprising, 
and his little estate being, I believe, somewhat encumbered, accepted the offer, 
sold his estate, and agreed for a farm, consisting partly of old inclosures, in part of 
common-field land, and in a still greater proportion of the heath to be inclosed.”  
-P-A-G-E-322
310 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
| 
in land, he could make a profit of 10 per cent by using it in 
stocking a farm.' 
There is evidence that many landowning farmers became 
tenant farmers because they found it more profitable. For 
example, before the new agriculture was introduced there were 
many small owners in Norfolk who cultivated their own land. 
Instances are noted of parishes which had at one time been 
1 James Anderson is the author of a short article published in Hunter’s “Georgical 
Essays,” Vol. VI, p. 213 (York, 1804), which is entitled, “The Bad Consequence 
of a Farmer Lessening his Capital by the Purchase of Land.” The article reads as 
follows: “Those who are fond of political calculations may have here full scope for 
their ingenuity, by supposing that two men of equal spirit, knowledge, and capital, 
set out in the agricultural line. One of them as a farmer, on a lease; and the other 
as a small proprietor, or yeoman. Let the capital be taken any how at random; 
say, £2000. The yeoman, we shall say, lays out £1500 of that sum in the purchase 
of a farm, which at thirty years’ purchase [that is, thirty times the annual rent or 
annual value] would be worth £50 a year, and he has 500 left for stocking and im- 
proving it. The other leases a farm, which, at a fair rent, is worth £200 a year. 
Let us follow out the calculation, — first, in regard to the profits that the different 
occupiers themselves can enjoy, and the rate at which their families can afford 
to live; and, second, with regard to the augmentation of agricultural produce that 
each of them could afford to the state; and let this calculation be continued for a 
considerable number of years. Then strike the balance, and see what an amazing 
difference!” 
Again, in recent times when the subject of restoring the old order of yeoman 
farmers was being agitated, James Caird (J. R. Agr. S. E., Series III, Vol. I, p. 27) 
gives a very clear statement of the problem suggested by James Anderson three 
quarters of a century earlier. Caird writes: “There are two capitals employed in 
British agriculture; that of the landowners and that of the farmer. The first, 
which is the land itself, and the permanent improvements upon it, had hitherto 
been certain and safe, and, therefore, yielding a small, but regular, return; the 
other, the livestock and crops, subject to risk of seasons, and speculations, and 
liable to compensation prices, requiring a much larger percentage to cover risk. 
The capitalist is content with 3 per cent for his heretofore secure investment, which 
carried with it also influence and social position. A farm worth £50 an acre for 
the freehold needs a further capital of £10 an acre to provide the farmer’s capital 
for its cultivation. The landowner is satisfied with a return of 3 per cent on his 
£50, while the tenant looks for ro per cent for management and risk and interest 
on his £10. Let us suppose that the farmer has a capital sufficient to buy 100 acres 
at this price, and stock them; he would get for his £5000, invested in freehold, 
£150, and for his £1000, farm capital, £100; together, £250. But if he followed 
the custom of his country and used the whole of his capital in cultivating another 
man’s land, he would with his £6000 hire 600 acres, on which his returns ought to 
be £600. He, in truth, thus trades on the capital of the landowner, practically, 
let to him at the moderate rate of 3 per cent, which he converts into a trade profit 
on his own capital of 1o per cent.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  
  DECLINE ‘OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 31I 
occupied entirely by this class of farmers. But by 1787 there 
had been a striking decline in the number of those belonging to 
this class. Marshall says that the small proprietors saw all 
about them tenant farmers, whom they had held as their 
inferiors, reaping great profits and rising to a degree of affluence 
superior to their own. The tenant farmers were able to live 
in a style too extravagant for the small proprietors, and this 
naturally made the latter dissatisfied with their position, ‘‘ and 
either launched out into extravagance ill suited to their income, 
or voluntarily sold their comparatively small patrimonies, in 
order that they might, agreeably with the fashion or frenzy 
of the day, become great farmers.” The lands owned by these 
yeoman farmers fell into the hands of men of fortune and became 
united with their large estates. 
The manufacturing industries did not merely expand during 
this period, they changed their form of organization; and this 
change in organization had an important influence upon the 
small farmers of England. As the factory system became 
established, the domestic system of manufacturing was no 
longer profitable, and the small farmers who had depended 
upon spinning and weaving for a part of their income were 
deprived of this means of supplementing the returns of their 
small holdings. Many of these small farmer-manufacturers 
were absorbed by the large industries of the towns, others turned 
their entire attention to agriculture and became prosperous 
farmers, while others were reduced, in time, to the ranks of the 
agricultural laborers. 
But these are not the only ways in which the growth of manu- 
factures and commerce influenced rural affairs. Many who had 
made their fortunes in manufactures or in commerce desired 
to own country homes. These country homes often consisted 
of very small areas with villas built upon them, but more com- 
monly, owing to an “inordinate desire” to be connected with the 
new agriculture, the wealthy merchants and manufacturers pur- 
chased farms and operated them, not for profit, but for pleasure. 
While farming for pleasure led to the buying out of many 
landowning farmers in the vicinity of the large centers of wealth, 
   
-P-A-G-E-324
  312 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
this was of less permanent significance than the fact that many 
of the men who had acquired wealth wished to acquire social 
and political position; and this could be done most readily 
by becoming great landlords. This led many of the new men 
of wealth to buy land and establish their families upon large 
estates. This competition of rich men in the land market 
resulted in high land values relatively to the rental value of 
land, which made it all the more difficult for farmers to buy 
land. In these various ways the reorganization of agriculture 
in England at the close of the eighteenth century tended to 
reduce the number of farmers who owned the land which they 
cultivated, and to increase the numbers of great landlords and 
of tenant farmers. 
Fluctuating land values and agricultural depressions hastened 
the decline of landowning farmers. The wide discrepancy 
between the rate of return on investment in land, and the rate 
of interest which farmers had to pay on borrowed funds, was a 
constant force tending to reduce landownership on the part of 
farmers. The work of the agricultural depression was that of 
speeding up the movement at times by reducing incomes and 
forcing mortgaged owners to sell their farms. 
In the normal movement of affairs the farms passed from 
father to son, but it was usual for the other members of the 
family to be provided for. This usually meant that the son 
who took the farm had to do so under heavy encumbrance. 
It would appear that primogeniture and entail were institutions 
affecting the large landlords, but little practiced among the 
smaller owners, with whom the idea of more or less equal division 
of property among all members of the family prevailed. There 
were always many landowning farmers who were heavily in 
debt and to this class depression often resulted in forced sale. 
With wealthy lords always in the market for land these farms 
were absorbed into the large estates. 
The depression in English agriculture from 1820 to 1836 
resulted in a marked decline in landownership on the part of 
English farmers. The first twelve years of the nineteenth 
century were extremely prosperous times for English agriculture, 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  
  DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 313 
and until 1820 prices had not been reduced very materially ; 
but from 1820 to 1836 prices were comparatively low. This 
era of low prices, following the great prosperity of war times, 
wrought disaster among all classes in England who were de- 
pendent upon agriculture for an income. Tooke attributes 
the high prices of one period and the low prices of the other to 
the war, the currency, and the variations of the seasons, along 
with a rapidly growing population engaged in manufactures 
and commerce. The war made the importation of food danger- 
ous and expensive and a somewhat debased currency, and bad 
seasons at the close of the century, with an increasing demand 
for food, resulted in extraordinarily high prices. On the other 
hand, peace, a restored currency, and a series of excellent crops 
after 1819 resulted in a great reduction in prices. 
The parliamentary report made by the Select Committee on 
Agriculture for the year 1833 shows large numbers of landowning 
farmers in the various parts of England at that date. Many 
of these men held estates which had been handed down from 
father to son for many generations, while large numbers had 
purchased the land they occupied. But these yeomen farmers 
were hard pressed and many had sold their land before 1833. 
When we go carefully through the minutes of evidence given 
before the committee we are especially impressed with the rapid 
decrease in the number of landowning farmers, which had 
taken place after the war, and before 1833. In Cumberland 
and Westmoreland the number had “ considerably diminished.” 
Up to the war properties had continued long in the same families, 
but in 1833, Mr. Blamire said he believed that since 1815 a 
greater change had taken place in the proprietorship of the 
small farms than in any antecedent period of much longer 
duration. In 1837, Blamire was again before the Committee, 
and says: ‘The condition [of the landowning farmers in 
Cumberland] is generally speaking most pitiable. At the 
present moment they are as a body, in fact, ceasing to exist at 
all.” Mr. Merry, the owner and occupier of a three-hundred 
acre farm in the North Riding of Yorkshire stated that in the 
different dales in the district where he lived the farmers had  
-P-A-G-E-326
  314 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
nearly all been “ancient freeholders”; but the number of 
such farmers had been “ regularly lessening for ten years,” 
during which time they had been reduced about a seventh. 
From Mr. W. Simpson we learn that the landowning farmers 
were “nearly all gone” near Doncaster, Yorkshire. In Not- 
tinghamshire there were ‘“‘ comparatively very few remaining.” 
In Leicestershire, Northumberland, and the Midland Counties, 
generally, small proprietors farming their own land were numer- 
ous, but “a great many of them” had been ruined. In Shrop- 
shire and in Cheshire the number of “ small landed proprietors ” 
had “ greatly diminished, . . . since the year 1800.” In Here- 
fordshire there were still a great many yeomen but fewer than 
twenty years earlier. In Worcestershire a good many free- 
holders, who farmed their own lands, had sold out. In Kent, 
near Rochester, no great number had gone to the wall, but they 
were poor, many of them living little better than workingmen. 
Such farmers were yet numerous in Hampshire and West 
Sussex, but many had been compelled to sell their estates and 
those who remained were “‘ much reduced in point of circum- 
stances.” In Wiltshire the number of landowning farmers had 
diminished “ most materially ” within the past fifteen years. 
In Somersetshire land had been changing hands a great deal since 
the war, and the number of farmers who bought land was not so 
great as the number of those who had sold. It was the custom 
there for the landlords to “run out” the life leases and not 
make any new ones. Thus all the evidence points to the con- 
clusion that an unusually rapid decline of the yeomanry had 
taken place during the period of the agricultural depression 
which followed the close of the Napoleonic wars. We shall now 
investigate somewhat in detail the causes of this unusually 
rapid decline. 
Extravagance, living beyond one’s income, often leads to 
bankruptcy in all lines of business, and it would be strange, 
indeed, if this were not, occasionally, the cause which compels 
farmers to sell their estates. From John Norden we learn 
that in 1607 this was sometimes the cause of failure on the 
part of landowning farmers in England, In 1833 a great many
-P-A-G-E-327
    DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 315 
of the yeomen of Cheshire were living beyond their means. 
During the period of high prices they had accustomed them- 
selves to a standard of living which they were unable to main- 
tain after prices had fallen, without gradually consuming their 
estates. Lee says of this class, “‘ Their property is nearly gone.” 
There is a suggestion that a change of this kind in the habits 
of the yeomen farmers may have been the occasion of forced 
sales of land in Worcestershire and in Somersetshire. 
But while extravagance may at times have been the cause of 
failure, the yeomen as a class were industrious and frugal. 
Speaking of the yeomanry of Cumberland, Blamire says, they 
“are quite as frugal as the tenantry and often more so, and 
their situation is often worse. ... They equally lodge their 
laborers in their own houses, and dine at the same table 
with them.” Having to give up their estates was “by no 
means the effect of improvidence on their part.” Mr. W. Thur- 
nall said that in Cambridgeshire the yeomen were very economi- 
cal and always hard-working men. “ There is not a more 
industrious man in the three counties,” says J. B. Turner, 
‘than a man in Herefordshire whose estate has been sold under 
bankruptcy.” 
It was not, as a rule, lack of frugality and industry which ruined 
so many of the yeomanry during this period of depression ; 
it was primarily the fall in prices at a time when indebtedness 
was very prevalent with this class. This indebtedness was 
sometimes incurred for the purpose of purchasing land, some- 
times for improvement, often to provide for the younger mem- 
bers of the family, and, occasionally, to cover general living 
expenses. 
Mr. W. Simpson told the Committee of 1833 that the yeo- 
manry near Doncaster were “many of them bankrupts.” 
“Farmers who, having four or five thousand pounds, bought 
farms twenty-five or thirty years ago, borrowing part of the 
purchase money, have been obliged to sell, and they have 
nothing left.” In ‘Nottinghamshire “a great number bought 
land at high prices, and having mortgaged their farms for 
more than their value at the reduced prices, they have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  316 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
almost universally ruined.” This class of farmers met with the 
same misfortune in Lincolnshire. In Cheshire, ‘‘ A great many 
farmers got a considerable sum of money, and were mad to 
lay it out in land. They purchased land at forty years’ pur- 
chase, in some instances, and borrowed probably half the 
money,” and soon after, the produce sold for so much less than 
formerly that they could not pay the interest on the money they 
had borrowed and were “ obliged to sell their properties for 
what they could get.” In Shropshire, again, farmers paid 
high prices for land and “ borrowed money, as much as they 
could sell the property for afterwards.” These same stories 
are repeated for Norfolk, Hampshire, Somersetshire, Berkshire, 
and Buckinghamshire. 
Improvements do not appear to have been very generally the 
occasion of indebtedness, but in some instances the witnesses 
before the Select Committee gave this as an important cause. 
The provision for younger children, or the paying off of the 
other heirs when one member of the family took the estate, 
was often the occasion of heavy indebtedness. In Cumberland, 
the “ statesmen ” had large families and “ from a miscalculation 
of their real situation ” they left their children “ larger fortunes 
than they ought to have done, and saddled the oldest son with 
the payment of a sum of money which it was impossible for 
him to pay.” This is given as an important cause of in- 
debtedness in Nottinghamshire, Somersetshire, Berkshire, and 
Buckinghamshire. 
Thus it would seem that in 1833 these small estates were very 
generally encumbered. The indebtedness had been incurred 
during the period of high prices; and when prices fell the debt 
was often equal to, if not greater than, the value of the land. 
The whole net product would not, in many cases, pay the 
interest. Where this did not force the yeomen to give up their 
estates at once, the land usually came into the market at the 
death of the owner, as no member of the family cared, as a 
tule, to take up the burden of mortgaged ownership which had 
come to be looked upon as less desirable than tenancy. This 
fall of prices at a time when mortgages were very prevalent 
   
-P-A-G-E-329
  DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 317 
was the immediate cause of the rapid decline in landownership 
on the part of farmers during the twenties, thirties, and forties 
of the nineteenth century. 
When this land came upon the market it was usually pur- 
chased by great landlords, merchants, or manufacturers, who 
very rarely cared to put it upon the market again; and thus 
the results of this temporary depression have been more perma- 
nent than we should expect in a country where landownership 
on a large scale does not involve so many social advantages, 
and where systems of primogeniture and entail do not bind the 
large estates together permanently. 
By 1836 the depression which followed the war had prac- 
tically ceased and the period from this date until 1875 was, 
on the whole, an era of great prosperity for English agriculture, 
though the low returns on landed investments, lapsing life 
leases, forced sales for settling estates, etc., were gradually 
reducing the number of yeomen farmers decade after decade, 
until by the close of the third quarter of the century they were 
found only here and there; and tenancy was the rule. In 1883 
John Rae estimated that probably not more than 5 per cent of 
the farmers of England owned the land which they cultivated, 
yet during this period of prosperity farmers sometimes pur- 
chased land. A slight movement in this direction to some 
extent counteracted the result of the tendency on the part of 
landowning farmers to alienate their estates. 
By 1875 the foreign wheat supply had become more easily 
accessible, as well as more abundant; and the depression which 
followed ruined hundreds of farmers and rendered many of the 
landlords comparatively poor. In 1895 the Royal Commission 
on Agriculture sent assistant commissioners into the various 
parts of the country to gather information concerning the 
effects of the agricultural depression. Many of these assistant 
commissioners did not report upon the landowning farmers, 
possibly because they found no representatives of this class, 
but others have given valuable bits of information. 
Cumberland still retained some of her “ statesmen,” land- 
owning farmers, in 1895, but the problems of the second quarter
-P-A-G-E-330
  318 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, 
of the century were still confronting them. In consequence 
of the legacies and annuities which eldest sons had to pay on 
the basis of the high prices which prevailed before the depression 
of 1875, a great many yeomen farmers were “ over head and 
ears in debt.” Not only had prices fallen, but the number of 
years’ purchase at which land could be bought had been reduced. 
These estates were usually mortgaged, and often so heavily 
that the farmer who nominally owned his land had more to 
pay as interest than the tenant farmers paid as rent. It is 
said that this class of farmers had been gradually decreasing 
in numbers for many years. This gradual decline is illustrated 
in a most interesting manner by the figures available for the 
parish of Abbey Quarter, as shown in Table XXII.

“ There have been three causes for the gradual diminution in 
numbers of the statesmen,” says Mr. Fox. ‘In the first place, 
many of them, tempted by the high prices offered for their land 
by large landowners, have sold. . . . Secondly, a number of 
them, since the lower prices, have let their land to tenants. 
But, thirdly, the qualities which are necessary to insure success 
on a small holding, and which should be conspicuous both in 
the owner and his wife, namely, energy and thrift, are not 
necessarily hereditary qualities . . . and there are cases where 
land has had to be sold because the mode of life, which was 
pursued by the father, and accompanied by success, was not 
acceptable to the son.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 319 
In Westmoreland the landowning farmers had gradually 
disappeared until, in 1895, they were nearly extinct. ‘“ How- 
ever, we may regret the change,” to quote Coleman, after 
Wilson Fox, “it appears to have been inevitable. Land is an 
expensive luxury, and not a profitable investment. As civi- 
lization progressed, and the cost of living increased, returns 
were not proportionately advanced. The land became gradu- 
ally burdened with charges, and often suffering in condition, was 
eventually parted with, going as a rule to swell the larger 
estates. Nor as regards the public advantage, need such a 
result be lamented, for it is quite certain that a flourishing ten- 
antry under a liberal and wealthy owner, are far more productive 
than owners whose means are too straitened to allow of the 
proper application of capital. Probably the most complete 
illustration of this change is seen in the Earl of Bective’s fine 
property at Underly, which comprises about 25,000 acres. 
A large part of this property was formerly owned by 
small proprietors, mostly statesmen. These men held on as 
long as possible, and were eaten up by debts and charges, 
and the soil wretchedly impoverished. The trustees of the 
late Alderman Thomson, who himself, if I mistake not, sprang 
from a statesman family, bought up the farms by degrees, and 
there is still money waiting similar investments. In no case 
did the investment pay more than two and three-fourths per 
cent on the purchase money. In many cases the former owners 
continued as the tenants; and when the land was drained 
and limed, and proper buildings erected, these men, who were 
formerly hard up, became well-to-do farmers.... The 
Underly Estate probably yields more than double the prod- 
uce of which the land was capable when divided and ill 
managed.” 
Writing of this same estate, Lefevre gives some additional 
facts which are very interesting and give clearness to the 
picture. ‘ This great property. . . was gradually accumulated 
and purchased under the express direction of the will of a man 
who, two generations ago, made a large fortune in trade, and 
whose only daughter married a nobleman. The estate was  
-P-A-G-E-332
      AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  320 
made up of 226 different purchases, nearly all of them cases 
where the vendors belonged to the class of yeomen farmers, 
or statesmen, as they are called in that district, who, them- 
selves and their ancestors, had cultivated their own lands for 
many generations. Instead then of 226 distinct owners of 
land, there is now a single owner. It may safely be assumed, 
in respect of this great property, that, under the existing system 
of family entail permissible by law, it will for generations 
to come remain intact in a single ownership.” 
Lincolnshire still possessed a large number of small peasant 
proprietors and some large yeomen farmers, in 1895. Many 
farmers had bought land during the prosperous times prior to 
1875, and had paid double the price for which it would sell 
after the fall in prices had brought on the depression. A large 
proportion of the purchase money had frequently been obtained 
by giving a mortgage on the land, and in some cases the land 
had fallen in value until it was worth less than the face value of 
the mortgage. Fox says of these men: “ Many ... have 
already sunk, overwhelmed by the burden of interest they had 
to pay.” Mr. Fox devotes several pages to the condition of 
the small landowning farmers of the southern part of Lincoln- 
shire. Most of these people worked hard and lived poorly. 
In reading the report one might easily think Mr. Fox was para- 
phrasing Young’s report on the same district, written one hun- 
dred years before, were it not for the further evidence of ruin 
on every hand. In speaking of these small proprietors, Fox 
says: “The possession of land has been the ruin of hundreds 
in the past and is a millstone around the neck of hundreds in the 
present. Not the least regrettable reflection in this sad story 
is that most of these small owners are the flower of a class, the 
pick of the foremen and the laborers, who excelled in the 
performance of their duties, who toiled and saved and denied 
themselves for years to raise themselves out of one class into 
another, and who, when they had bought their independence 
and a new social position, found themselves bound to admit 
failure, their hard savings gone, their energies wasted, their 
hopes crushed, to retrace their steps back into the ranks out of 
      
-P-A-G-E-333
    DECLINE OF LANDOWNING FARMERS IN ENGLAND 321 
which they had stepped, at a time of life when they had expended 
much of their vitality and all their ambition.” 
In Cambridgeshire the depression proved very disastrous 
to the farmers generally. The landowning farmers, burdened 
with mortgages, were the first to succumb; and those of this 
class who remained, in 1895, were in great straits. ‘“‘ In several 
districts,” says Fox, “‘ evidence was privately given me of this, 
and in one of them a gentleman, who was in the position to 
know the facts, stated that all the yeoman farmers there. . . 
were heavily mortgaged.” 
“ We have had a good many yeomen in the County of Nor- 
folk,” said Mr. Read before the Commission in 1897, “and I 
say that they are much the hardest hit of all. They have to 
bear both the losses of the landlord and the losses of the tenant, 
and there have been the most disastrous failures. A good many 
of our farmers were told twenty-five years ago that the best 
thing that they could do was to buy their farms, and they did 
so, but they had not enough cash, and they had to mortgage their 
farms. They have gone to the wall worse by far than the 
common tenant farmers. There are a good many of our old 
and most respected yeomen who have disappeared within the 
last few years. I feel confident that they will almost all of 
them go unless there is a change for the better.” 
Speaking of Suffolk, Mr. Everett of the commission said, “We 
had a great many yeomen farmers and in the intense competition 
for land in the good times, a great many men took that course of 
making themselves, as they thought, independent ; they bought 
land and mortgaged it, and I should think three quarters of 
that class of men are now stripped of every penny they had.” 
During the “good times,” the farmers of Wiltshire saved 
money and many of them were able to purchase farms, but as 
in other places, they borrowed money and their investment 
proved disastrous. One witness cited four instances within 
his own knowledge of farmers who bought their farms about 
1875. Of these, two had come to grief and absconded, a third 
had lost his farm, which was in the hands of the mortgagee, 
while the fourth was still holding his land.

  322 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
In speaking of the condition of landowning farmers in general, 
the final report of the Royal Commission states that “ As a 
rule their properties, whether inherited or purchased by the 
present proprietors, are charged with mortgages, and the 
mortgagee makes no remission of the arr due to him. 
In consequence of the shrinkage in the value of land, the interest 
on the mortgage has become in many cases a burden, which the 
owner has been unable to bear, and frequently where the yeoman 
farmer has succeeded in paying the interest due from him it 
has been a heavier rent than he would have paid to a landlord.” 
Thus it has come to pass that landowning farmers are rare 
and the tenant farmer employing a considerable number of 
agricultural laborers is typical in England to-day. Under 
conditions as they exist in England landownership is not eco- 
nomically profitable to the farmer. Whether tenant farmers 
are equally desirable citizens, and whether the nation which 
leaves the problem of landownership to the free play of forces 
which eliminate the small landowner’ and establish tenant 
farming on a larger scale with a large agricultural laboring class 
will prove to be as strong a nation as where the landowning 
farmer is established and protected is one of the great questions 
that should receive consideration by American statesmen to-day.

        CHAPTER XXV 
RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS IN 
ENGLAND 
So long as a country has an abundant supply of productive 
land, and its agriculture is characterized by the extensive use 
of the natural fertility of the soil, the adjustment of the relations 
between landlords and tenants is a comparatively simple matter. 
But when some of the elements of this original fertility have 
begun to show signs of exhaustion, or when the increasing 
demands of a growing population make it necessary that each 
acre of land shall yield a larger product, so that it becomes 
necessary to introduce a more intensive system of culture, 
involving investments which cannot be realized upon for several 
years, the tenant problem becomes a serious one. 
The same progress which makes intensive farming necessary 
tends also to augment the numbers of those who must hire the 
land which they cultivate. With the growth of population, com- 
petition for the use of land becomes more and more keen and 
drives the price of land higher and higher. This makes it ever 
more and more difficult for the succeeding generations of farmers 
to acquire the ownership of land. Other things remaining 
equal, with the progress of society the tenant problem becomes 
more general as well as more difficult to solve. 
England is preéminently the land of tenant farmers. Less 
than 14 per cent of the farm land of that country is reported as 
operated by its owners, and in most cases such land is operated 
by hired farmers, or bailiffs as they are called. About 86 per cent 
of the farm land of England is operated by tenants who pay a 
fixed rent for its use. Share tenancy is not practiced in England. 
It was more than a century ago that the progress of English 
industrial society had reached the stage of development where 
323

       324 
intensive agriculture was socially desirable, and also profitable 
to the farmers where their relations to the land were so adjusted 
as to guarantee to them just returns upon their investments. 
The earliest attempts at improving the agriculture of the 
country at once brought forward the tenant problem. In 1649 
Walter Blith wrote: “If a tenant be at ever so great pains or 
cost for improving of his land, he doth thereby but occasion 
a great rack upon himself, or else invest his landlord with his 
cost and labor gratis, or at best lies at his landlord’s mercy 
for requital, which occasions a neglect of good husbandry to 
his own, the land, the landlord, and the kingdom’s suffering.” 
For more than a century the rural economists of England 
have been trying to solve this problem. Hence it is in England 
that the tenant problem can best be studied in the light of 
history. 
Prior to the introduction of the new agriculture, which move- 
ment became important during the latter half of the eighteenth 
century, the tenant farmers of England usually held their lands 
“at will,” without any written agreements. Under this tenure, 
the common law and the customs of the estates formed the only 
tie between owners and tenants, and either party could bring 
the tenancy to a close, by giving six months’ notice to the other.” 
Towards the close of the eighteenth century, it became a com- 
mon custom, where land was held from year to year, to draw 
up legal agreements, by which the tenants bound themselves 
“to the fulfillment of certain clauses and conditions.” ? But 
the most significant movement of this period was that in favor 
of leases for a term of years. The rural economists of that time 
were quite generally of the opinion that long leases were neces- 
sary wherever the farmers were expected to make investments 
in or upon the land, such as require several years to yield their 
fullreturn. It was stated in 1799 that the improvements which 
had taken place in England prior to that time had been almost

  RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 325 
entirely due to the custom of granting twenty-one-year leases, 
and that where it was uncommon to grant leases for long periods 
of years, agriculture remained in a backward condition.! 
During the early years of the nineteenth century the English 
Board of Agriculture published a series of surveys which set 
forth the conditions of agriculture in every county of the king- 
dom. This material, supplemented by the other agricultural 
writings of the time, makes it possible to present, in considerable 
detail, the history of the attempts to solve the tenant problem 
in England by the introduction of long leases. 
From these surveys it appears that the greater part of the 
tenant farmers of England one hundred years ago held their 
farms “at will,” without written agreements, or “from year 
to year ” under written agreements. In either case they might 
be thrown out of the possession of their farms on six months’ 
notice, at the pleasure of the landlord. But while this was the 
dominant form of land tenure throughout the greater part of 
England, the use of long-term leases had greatly increased during 
the latter part of the eighteenth century, and leases varying in 
duration from three to twenty-one years were found in every 
county. Twenty-one-year leases were much used in the eastern 
counties, and leases running from seven to fourteen years were 
quite common in the western and southern counties. The 
county of Norfolk, the home of the new agriculture, was pre- 
eminently the land of long leases. Arthur Young wrote of 
this county: “The great improvements which for seventy 
years past have rendered Norfolk famous for its husbandry, 
were effected by means of twenty-one-year leases, a circum- 
stance which very fortunately took place on the first attempt to 
break up the heaths and warrens in the northwestern part 
of the county. ... In general it may be held for sound 
doctrine in Norfolk, that an estate can neither be improved, nor 
even held to its former state of improvement, without long 
leases.” 2 This view was held, also, by that most competent

agricultural writer of the time, William Marshall,' who wrote 
as follows on this same subject, in 1795: ‘‘ Marling is the 
principal improvement of a Norfolk farm, but who would marl 
on a seven years’ lease? Where much marling is to be done, 
fourteen years is too short a term.” 
In some places, it is true, the old and simple system of holding 
land from year to year was thought to be entirely satisfactory. 
It was reported that great estates were let in full confidence 
without leases in the East Riding of Yorkshire, ‘‘ where a lease 
was never asked for, probably never wished for,” because the 
tenants were “ equally secure’ when holding their farms from 
year to year.” In Staffordshire the conditions were much the 
same.’ In Derbyshire, the Duke of Devonshire granted no 
leases, “but owing to his fair treatment of tenants” improve- 
ments were carried on extensively; but the other landlords of 
the county were not able to inspire such confidence. Arthur 
Young, who was the champion of long leases, laid down the 
general rule, that upon rich soils where no improvements are 
necessary, “‘ the want of leases cannot be material; but where 
liming, marling, draining, fencing, etc., are demanded, the 
want of a lease will often be the want of the improvements.” > 
But while “‘ tenancy at will” or “from year to year” was 
quite satisfactory where no improvements were to be made, or 
where the landlords were able to win the confidence of their 
tenants, the surveyors reported quite generally that the security 
of long leases was necessary to induce the farmers to carry on 
the needed improvements. In remarking upon the lack of 
security to the investments of tenants in England, at that time, 
James Anderson says “an unprejudiced person, who should 
attentively consider the whole system of conduct pursued by 
landed ‘proprietors, and the ideas that in general prevail in 
this respect, would believe that agriculture was an employment 
which it was deemed to be a good policy to repress above all 
others.” ®

    RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 327 
John Tuke, who for many reasons favored the letting of land 
from year to year, says in his report on the North Riding of 
Yorkshire: “‘ Experience, nevertheless, teaches us, that under 
some landlords, especially those in straitened circumstances, 
. . . or where considerable improvements are to be made at the 
expense of the tenants, it is more advisable to be under greater 
certainty, though attended with greater rent.””4 The desir- 
ability of increasing the number of twenty-one-year leases in 
the West Riding of Yorkshire was stated very forcibly by 
Robert Brown, who believed that without long-term leases 
improvements could not be made.? In Derbyshire improve- 
ments were thought to be much retarded because the tenants 
lacked the security of long-term leases.? In Lincolnshire, where 
leases for a term of years were very rare, it was generally be- 
lieved that, while improvements had been carried forward 
fairly well, long-term leases would result in much greater im- 
provement. In Leicestershire, the yeomen farmers were 
improving their lands, but the tenant farmers were slow to 
make improvements owing to the lack of long-term leases. It 
was said that while in many cases the present landlords could 
be trusted by the farmers, the estates might change hands at 
any time and that a new lord usually meant a different ordering 
of affairs. The phrase, “‘ New lords, new laws,” was current 
in Leicestershire.6 In 1784 William Marshall was of the 
opinion that, in the midland counties, it was of little importance 
whether land was held under a lease for a term of years, or from 
year to year, —such was the confidence of the tenantry in 
the landlords. An instance is given of a young man who held 
a large farm from year to year, and who proceeded to improve 
the land in various ways. Five years later the following note 
was added to the earlier statement:  ‘‘ Unfortunately for the 
tenant, in this instance, his farm is now on sale, and the very 
expensive improvements which he has been making, are, prob- 
ably, in a great measure sunk.” ®

It was thought that farmers would be more enterprising in 
Shropshire, if more leases were granted.! In Worcestershire, 
it was believed, both by the landlords and by the tenants, 
that, where improvements were to be made, a lease for a term of 
years was necessary. John Friest, the author of the “ Bucking- 
hamshire Survey,” made a plea for long leases, especially where 
improvements were to be made. In Cambridgeshire, where 
most of the farms were held on yearly tenures, the lack of cer- 
tainty of tenure was much felt. In general the tendency was 
for the tenant farmers who held their farms from year to year, 
to adhere to the old customs and to attempt no new improve- 
ments; for the saying: 
He that havocs may sit, 
He that improves must flit, 
expressed a common belief among the tenant farmers of that 
day who held their land from year to year. The farmers and 
the rural economists of the time were quite generally agreed that 
the adoption of long-term leases throughout the land was 
essential to the introduction of the desired improvements in 
agriculture. 
The long-term lease of one hundred years ago reached its 
highest degree of perfection in the county of Norfolk. The 
two main objects to be secured by the covenants of the lease 
were: first, to guarantee to the tenant the continued possession 
of the farm for a period sufficiently long to encourage invest- 
ments in improvements, especially such improvements as are 
made in and upon the soil by careful tilth and by the addition 
of artificial fertilizers ; and second, to secure the landlord against 
improper use of the property during the last few years of the 
tenancy so that the farm would be returned to the landlord 
in good condition. “No department of the management of 
an estate gives more uneasiness to both landlord and tenant,” 
says Marshall, “ than do removals, or exchanges of tenants; and 
every covenant which facilitates this unpleasant business is 
valuable.” ?

         RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 329 
In the Norfolk leases the greater number of the covenants 
which restrict the farmer in his operations pertain to the last 
three years of the tenancy. This was true to a greater or less 
extent in the other counties where long-term leases were in use. 
This method of laying down restrictions seems to have been 
based on the belief that the interest of the tenant would lead 
him to farm in accordance with the rules of good husbandry until 
the last few years of the tenancy, at which time he could increase 
his own profits by exhausting the soil and leaving the farm in 
bad condition for the incoming tenant. 
We wish to call especial attention to a covenant given by 
Marshall as found in the Norfolk leases, which forbids the taking 
of more than two grain crops without a whole year’s fallow, a 
crop of turnips, or “a two years’ lay.” Writing nine years 
later than Marshall (1804), Arthur Young gives the following 
clause among “ new covenants ” in use in the county of Norfolk. 
The tenant “ shall not sow any of the lands with two successive 
crops of corn, grain, pulse, rape or turnips for seed,” ? without 
the consent of the landlord. The rule that two grain crops 
should not be grown in succession on the same piece of land 
became an established custom in most of the grain-growing 
districts of England. This rule was in harmony with the 
Norfolk four-course system of crop rotation. In this four- 
course system, a fallow crop, that is a cultivated crop, usually 
a root crop, is followed by a crop of spring grain with which 
clover or grass seeds are sown. After harvesting the hay the 
next season, the field is plowed and put into condition for fall 
grain which is the fourth crop in the course. For more than a 
century this system has been the most highly approved of all 
systems of crop rotation in use in England. This same system 
was introduced into Germany by Albrecht Thaer. 
A study of the leases in use in the various counties of England 
at the close of the eighteenth century does not give so favorable 
an impression as do the descriptions of the Norfolk system. 
The limitations and restrictions as to the crops which could be 
grown, and as to the sysv2m o: crop rotation, were often of

such a character as to make them injurious to the interests of the 
farmers. These regulations were likely to be of such a character 
as would make it impossible for the farmers to adjust their 
farming to the demands of the times. In the Vale of Gloucester, 
for example, where nearly all of the land was as yet in the 
common fields, the tenants were required “ to fallow the arable 
land, every third or fourth year; according to the established 
course of husbandry of the township.” And again, “ not to 
sow hemp, flax, or rape seed on any part of the premises. Nor, 
otherwise, to cross-crop; but to sow the same corn and grain, 
from year to year, according to the best and most usual course of 
husbandry used in the respective townships.” + 
In writing on the subject of the restricting clauses, generally 
found in the leases of his time, Robert Brown says: “ The 
restrictions imposed during the time he occupies his farm, 
prevent the farmer from changing his management, or of adapt- 
ing his crops to the nature of the soil he possesses. Agriculture 
is a living science which is progressively improving, consequently 
what may be esteemed a good course of cropping at one time, 
may, from experience and observation, be afterwards found 
defective and erroneous. That particular covenants in a lease 
are obstacles to improvements cannot be disputed ; for the very 
nature of a covenant supposes that the practice to be regulated 
by it had arrived at its ne plus ultra, and could not be mended. 
These covenants or restrictions subsist more or less in every 
lease we heard of ; and the shorter the lease the more numerous 
they are. ... General rules of management are very proper 
in leases, such as, to keep the farm in good order, to consume 
all the straw raised upon it, and to sell no dung. These restric- 
tions we will allow; and every good farmer will follow them 
whether he is bound to doso or not. Nay, we will go farther — 
if leases of a proper duration were granted, it is very reasonable 
that the property of the landlord should be protected by restrict- 
ing clauses for the three years previous to their expiration. 
But after all, it will be found that no clause can be inserted, 
besides the general ones already mentioned, that will serve to 
1 W. Marshall, “Rural Economy of Gloucestershire,” Vol. I, p. 25.

  RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 331 
enhance the value of the land, except obliging the farmer to 
leave a proportional quantity of such land in grass at the 
expiration of the lease, and specifying the manner in which that 
land is to be sown down. Other clauses serve only to distress the 
farmer, but will never promote the interests of the land-lord.” + 
The agricultural writers of the time were by no means all in 
full agreement with Robert Brown in his views on the subject 
of leases. Leases seem to have been in best repute in the eastern 
counties, where they were usually for a term of twenty-one years. 
Mr. Bailey is quoted as saying, in criticism of Mr. Brown’s 
position as stated above, that, ‘if the proprietors of land were 
sure of always getting tenants that would act properly there 
would be no need of restricting covenants; but this is not 
always the case, and there are many instances of estates being 
much injured by exhausting crops where tenants were not 
properly restricted. That many covenants are useless or 
hurtful I readily admit ; but covenants may be so framed, that a 
tenant shall have ample liberty to take such crops as he shall 
think proper, and to propose such modes as shall benefit himself 
without injuring his landlord.” ? 
It was quite generally agreed that long leases, properly drawn, 
were extremely desirable from the standpoint of the farmer, 
wherever improvements were to be made. But the landlords 
were not so generally of the opinion that long-term leases 
were a good thing. Many landlords claimed that it made the 
tenants too independent.’ But a more important objection was 
found in the fact that while a lease of sufficient length would 
enable the tenant to make improvements, it was hard to arrange 
matters so that the tenants would not exhaust the land at the 
end of the tenancy. It often happened that a tenant would 
bring the land into good tilth and to a high degree of fertility 
during the early years of his tenancy, and then take as nearly 
everything out of it as possible during the last few years of 
the lease.

Another objection to the granting of leases for long terms 
became quite general between 1790 and 1815. The landlords 
objected that as a result of rising prices during the period covered 
by the leases, they sustained great losses. It was maintained 
by the landlords of Surrey, for example, that by letting land for 
a term of fourteen or twenty-one years or any longer period, 
the owners of the land actually received, “ almost every year 
during the currency of the lease, and certainly in the latter years 
of it, a less rent than he did at the commencement, from the 
depreciation in the value of money.”! And for this reason the 
landlords were objecting to the granting of leases. Even in the 
county of Norfolk, where the twenty-one-year lease had proved 
so beneficial, the landlords objected to long leases because it so 
often happened that soon after a farm was rented the prices 
of agricultural produce would rise so much higher than when 
the lease was taken, that the tenants were “ under-rented ” 
for a series of years.? The basis for complaint on this ground is 
shown by the fact that the average price of wheat was about 
twice as high for the five years from 1809 to 1813 as for the 
five years from 1790 to 1794.3 
A statement of the tenant problem and the solution proposed 
by an eminent rural economist of the time will be interesting in 
this connection. In his work on “ Landed Estates,” published 
in 1806, William Marshall reviews the existing forms of land 
tenure,* “the tenant holding at will”; “holding from year 
to year, under a written agreement, with specified covenants ”’ ; 
“leases for a term of years, as seven, fourteen, twenty-one, or 
greater number of years ”’; and says: 
“ Objections are urged against each of these species of tenancy. The 
depreciation of the circulating value of money, and the consequent 
nominal rise, in the rental value of lands, has rendered long leases 
greatly disadvantageous to proprietors: while annual holdings are 
not only discouraging to tenants; — especially to men of exertion 
and capital — but are a bar to the improvement, and a clog on the

          RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 333 
prosperity of an estate: beside being, in the first instance, unfriendly 
to the interests of proprietors; inasmuch as they lower the fair rental 
values of their lands. 
‘Some years ago, on perceiving the antipathy which had gone forth 
among men of fortune, against granting leases for long terms, and 
being well aware of the disadvantages of annual holdings, it occurred 
to me that agreements for occupying from three years to three years, 
instead of from year to year, would be an eligible species of tenancy : 
or, which is the same thing, granting leases for six years certain; 
with a condition that if neither party give notice to quit, before the 
expiration of the first three years, then the term to be prolonged to 
nine years; and so on, from three years to three years . . . until 
three years after notice has been duly given, by either party to the 
other. 
“This gives room for a tenant ‘to turn his hand in,’ and a loose to 
his exertions. He has, in reality, a fresh lease of six years granted 
him, every third year. This is sufficient to encourage him to keep 
his lands, continually, in a husbandlike state. And if he execute, at 
his own expense, any of the higher improvements, such as [improving 
waste lands, etc.] it is but reasonable that he should have, whenever 
he may quit his farm, an equitable remuneration for the remainder 
of such improvements. Thus, the tenant is placed on sure ground. 
He may till, manure, and improve, with much the same confidence, 
as if the lands in his occupation were his own property. 
“Tn return for such advantages, the tenant cannot refuse to cove- 
nant, that, during the last three years of his term, he will manage his 
farm in a husbandlike manner, and, at the end of the term, will leave 
it in such a state of cultivation and repair, as will induce a good tenant 
to take it, at a full rent; or suffer the proprietor to put it in such a 
state, at his (the outgoing tenant’s) expense. 
“An estate which is under lease, on these principles, and under 
attentive management, cannot be let down to an unprofitable state. 
It must continually remain under a regular course of husbandry, 
and in a state of cultivation and repair. If the acting manager do 
his duty, even the changing of tenants cannot interrupt its prosperity. 
The incoming tenant (under attentive management) steps into his 
farm, with the advantages that he would have enjoyed, had it been 
under his own direction for the three preceding years. 
“But, with a lease on this principle, and with a proper choice of 
tenants, removals can rarely happen. What superintendent, who    
-P-A-G-E-346
    
    AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  334 
knows the difficulty of procuring a good tenant, would wish to dis- 
charge him? And no such tenant will readily leave the farm he is 
settled upon, if he find proper treatment. Even should notice be 
given, in consequence of any misunderstanding between the parties, 
three years allow time for reflection; and, before they expire, re- 
sentment may die away, and cordiality be restored. If, however, 
either party remain dissatisfied, he has an easy way of dissolving the 
connection. Or if a proprietor or a superintendent is desirous to 
make fresh arrangements on an estate; or to regulate its rent roll, 
by the existing value of money; he need not wait many years to 
fulfill his desire. For if the tenant in occupancy will not agree to 
pay a fair rent, he has three years before him to choose one who will; 
another valuable advantage of the tenancy proposed. 
“Thus, a lease on this principle has a decided preference by a pro- 
prietor, to long leases. And its advantage over annual holdings is 
not less considerable. The lands of an estate are well worth from 5 
to 10 per cent more, to a tenant, under the former, than under the 
latter, tenancy. So that, besides the conveniences mentioned, a 
proprietor may be immediately adding very considerably to his in- 
come, by this principle of management. 
“This species of tenancy I have had the happiness of being the 
means of introducing, upon some considerable estates, in England, 
in Wales, and in Scotland; with, I believe, the mutual satisfaction 
of the men of fortune who possess them, and of their tenants.” 
While this system proposed by Marshall might solve the 
problem of adjusting the amount of rent to changes in real 
rental values, and while it might encourage the tenant to make 
such improvements as he could realize upon in three years, it 
lays down no scheme for determining the value of unexhausted 
improvements, and, indeed, does not even propose that a tenant 
shall have remuneration for the investments made upon the land 
during the last three years, and on which, if he farms in a hus- 
bandmanlike manner, he cannot realize all of the benefit. 
Thus it seems that Marshall failed to solve the most permanent 
difficulty which the tenant problem presented ; for the unsettled 
condition of the money market became less important in the 
course of time, while the problem of unexhausted improvements 
has been of increasing importance as the years have gone by.

    RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 335 
Various methods were devised, in different parts of England, 
for keeping the tenants from leaving the land in an exhausted 
condition at the termination of their leases. It was the custom 
on one estate in Shropshire to lease the land for twenty-one 
years “‘ certain,” and for seven years more at the option of the 
landlord. At the end of the twenty-one-year period, a new 
contract of the same kind might be entered into, if terms could 
be agreed upon, or the tenancy might be brought to a close, 
but the important condition was that if the tenant had reduced 
the land to a very low degree of fertility he could be forced to 
keep the farm for seven years longer at the old rent. Even if 
this system had succeeded in protecting the landlord, it failed 
even to recognize the right of the tenant to unexhausted improve- 
ments. 
The system which subsequent history has shown to be the most 
effective means of keeping the farmers from exhausting the land 
during the last few years of the tenancy, is that reported in the 
“Yorkshire Survey.” The system was that of granting remun- 
eration to the retiring tenant for all his investments on which 
time had not yet allowed him to realize their full returns; the 
tenant was then left free to farm as he pleased so long as he con- 
formed to the rules of good husbandry. One of the examples 
of this system is as follows: 
“The landlord covenants to allow the tenant, on quitting his farm, 
what two indifferent persons shall deem reasonable, for what is 
generally called full tillage and half tillage, being for the rent and 
assessment of his fallow ground, the plowing and the management 
of the same; the lime, manure, or other tillage laid thereon; the 
seed sown thereupon; the sowing and harrowing thereof; also for 
the sowing, harrowing, manuring, and managing any turnip fallow 
which he may leave unsown; also for any clover seed sown on the 
premises; and harrowing and rolling in of such seed; and for every 
other matter and thing done and performed in a husbandrylike 
manner on such fallow lands, in the two last years of the term; also 
for the last year’s manure left upon the premises; and for any manure 
and tillage laid upon the grass land.” !

During the period of rising prices prior to 1812, the farmers 
were anxious to rent land on long leases. It is said that at that 
time, “ good tenants always wanted leases,” that “ they were 
galloping after one another to take leases at any rent.”! After 
the close of the Napoleonic wars, prices fell back almost to their 
old level. The average price of wheat was just about half as 
high for the five years from'1821 to 1825, as for the five years 
from 1809 to 1813. With this fall in prices the farmers became 
even more averse to the taking of long leases than the landlords 
had previously been. One after another the witnesses before 
the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture, in 1833, bore 
testimony to the fact that the farmers were objecting seriously 
to taking long leases, because they did not know how soon 
they might be unable to pay the rent, as their capacity to pay 
the rent depended upon such uncertain prices. The farmers 
were in doubt as to how much protection they were to have from 
the competition of foreign producers. But without regard to 
this, they knew that the prices of agricultural products had been 
falling for several years in succession, and they were unable to 
tell when the limit would be reached. 
With depressed prices the landlords found new reasons for 
objecting to long leases. This was the time, one might think, 
for the landlords to regain what they had lost during the period 
of rising prices, but they found it rarely happened that the 
tenants were able to stand the losses incurred by falling prices. 
The farmer could not be forced to live up to his contract, if he 
was losing money. It was said that leases were binding upon 
the landlords but not upon the tenants. The fall in prices 
seemed to demoralize the farmers, so that the landlord was 
never certain that his tenant would not disregard the contract 
in case of a fall in prices, whereas the tenant would certainly 
remain to reap the benefits in case of a rise in prices. 
The remedy which was often prescribed for the evils of 
fluctuating prices was the introduction of “corn rents.”? By 
this it is not meant that the farmer was to give a certain

share of his crop to the landlord as rent, but that he should pay 
as rent the value of a certain fixed amount of grain. The rent 
was figured on the basis of what was called in Scotland the “ fiars 
prices of the county.” . In Scotland the sheriff of each county was 
bound to summon a jury once each year to examine on oath 
a number of witnesses, such as farmers, grain dealers, brewers, 
etc., and according to the evidence thus obtained, to fix the 
“fiars prices” of the different grades of grain. This system 
was quite generally resorted to in Scotland during the period of 
falling prices. Corn rents were advocated by the English rural 
economists of the time, and were introduced with success in a 
few instances in the western counties; but this system failed to 
gain general favor among the farmers and landlords of England.! 
The use of long leases declined rapidly in England during 
the period following the close of the continental wars. In those 
counties where they had been most numerous and most bene- 
ficial, the farmers came to prefer short leases or even tenancy 
from year to year. The long lease as a means of solving the 
tenant problem had been “ weighed in the balance and found 
wanting.” Yet it must be admitted that long leases had done 
a great deal of good in promoting improvements in English 
agriculture and now that the prices of agricultural products 
were depressed the farmers did not find it profitable to farm their 
lands so intensively as formerly even if they had long-term 
Jeases. Thus, the tenant problem was of less importance in 
the minds of the farmers for a series of years, until the return 
of prosperity again raised the question of investments in im- 
provements and the means of securing just returns upon such 
investments. 
The period from 1836 to 1875 was one of general prosperity 
for English farmers, and by 1850 the tenant problem was receiv- 
ing the attention of Parliament. The use of long leases had 
gradually declined during the first half of the nineteenth century, 
and while there were agricultural economists who still advocated 
this means of securing to the farmers legitimate returns upon

their investments, there was a very prevalent dislike to long 
leases on the part of both parties concerned. Yet it was gen- 
erally recognized that security to the tenant’s investments was 
essential to the promotion of that degree of intensity ofculture 
which was most profitable in the long run both to the tenant 
and to the landlord.t 
The long-period lease had proved so unsatisfactory that espe- 
cial attention was now given to the perfecting of the “‘ year 
to year’ agreement. The custom of “ tenant-right,” which had 
proved satisfactory in Lincolnshire, formed the basis for the 
hope that tenants holding their farms from year to year might 
be given that degree of security which would promote good 
agriculture. 
The introduction of agricultural improvements came rather 
later in Lincolnshire than in many other parts of England, but 
when the transition did come it was “ rapid and striking, perhaps 
more so than in any other county in England.” ? These im- 
provements were made, too, without the protection of long- 
time leases. They were made under the protection of the 
Lincolnshire system of tenant-right. ‘‘ It was very fortunate,” 
says Caird, “ that when the time [for the introduction of agri- 
cultural improvements] arrived, the leading landlords [of Lin- 
colnshire] were liberal and intelligent men.... They saw 
the advantage of encouraging tenants to embark their capital 
freely; and as leases were not the fashion of the county, they 
gave them that security for their invested capital, which is 
termed ‘ tenant-right,’ or compensation for unexhausted im- 
provements. Though this tenant-right may not be a strictly 
legal claim, it is universally admitted in Lincolnshire, the land- 
lord paying it when a farm falls into his own hands, and refusing 
to accept a tenant who declines to comply with the custom. It 
varies, however, considerably in the different parts of the county, 
1 To avoid the necessity of making specific references in great numbers it will 
simply be stated that the discussion of this period is based upon a Parliamentary 
Report on Agricultural Customs, Parliamentary Papers, 1847-1848, Vol. VII; and 
Caird’s “English Agriculture” in 1850 and 1851. In these sources the material 
here used is indexed under “tenant-right.’’

and appears to have enlarged in its obligations with the greater 
development of agricultural improvements. In North Lincoln- 
shire, the usual allowances claimed by the outgoing from the 
incoming tenant, include draining, marling, chalking, claying, 
lime, bone, guano, rape dust, and oil-cake. The following is the 
scale on which these allowances are usually made: 
“When the landlord has found tiles, and the tenant has done the 
labor, if done within twelve months before the end of the tenancy 
and no crop has been taken from land after the draining thereof is 
completed, the whole cost is allowed. If one crop has been taken 
from such land, three fourths of the cost are allowed, and so on, 
diminishing the allowance by one fourth for each crop taken; but 
this allowance is made only when the work is well and properly done 
by the tenant, to the satisfaction of the landlord or his agent, ex- 
pressed in writing. For marling or chalking, if done within twelve 
months before the end of the tenancy, the whole cost is allowed; for 
that done in the previous year, seven eighths of the cost are allowed ; 
and so on, diminishing the allowance by one eighth for each year 
that shall have elapsed since the marling or chalking. — For lime used 
within twelve months before the end of the tenancy, if no crop has 
been taken from the land limed in that year, the whole cost, including 
labor, is allowed; if one crop has been taken from such land, four 
fifths of the cost are allowed; and so on, diminishing the allowance 
by one fifth for each crop taken from such land.— For claying on 
light land, a similar allowance to that for lime.— For bones used 
within twelve months before the end of the tenancy two thirds of 
the cost are allowed, and for those used in the previous year one 
third of the cost.— For guano and rape dust used within twelve 
months before the end of the tenancy for turnips or other green crop, 
two thirds of the cost are allowed.— For oil-cake given to cattle and 
sheep one third of the cost price of that so used within twelve months 
before the end of the tenancy, and one sixth of the cost price of that 
so used in the previous year is allowed.’ 
“The amount of these allowances is settled by arbitration. . . . 
On the whole, . . . the system is believed to have worked well.”+ 
The custom of tenant-right was fully recognized in the 
counties of Sussex, Surrey, and Lincoln, in the Weald of Kent, 
1 Caird’s “English Agriculture in 1850 and 1851,” pp. 194-195.
-P-A-G-E-352
  340 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
in the northern part of Nottinghamshire, and in the West Riding 
of Yorkshire. In some of these regions the system was not 
giving very good results. In Surrey, the custom of tenant-right 
was said to be “ promoting an extensive system of fraud and 
falsehood among the farmers.” The custom seems to have 
been quite loosely formulated in that country, and it was possible 
for the farmers to “ work up a quitting,” as it was called,! and 
thus defraud the landlord or the succeeding tenant. Not being 
properly regulated the “‘ compensation ” often embraced “ large 
payments for imaginary improvements and alleged operations, 
which, even if they had ever been performed would be more 
injurious than beneficial.” ? 
But while the custom of tenant-right was very imperfect 
in its operations in some parts of England, the principle on which 
it was based was sound, and in time it was to be embodied in the 
laws of the land. The custom of tenant-right struck at the 
very heart of the tenant problem. It guaranteed to the tenant 
just returns for his investments, without involving the many 
disadvantages of the long-period lease. The experience of the 
landlords and tenants of Lincolnshire had already proved that 
where the system was properly regulated the custom of tenant- 
right was satisfactory in practice as well as sound in principle. 
In 1850 a bill was introduced in Parliament which aimed 
at the embodiment of this custom of tenant-right into a law. 
It was entitled “ A Bill for the Improvement of the Relation 
between Landlord and Tenant in England and Wales.” Its 
purpose, as stated in the preamble, was to insure to farmers 
compensation for properly constructed, permanent improve- 
ments. The idea of enacting a law of this kind was not new 
in 1850. Two hundred years before, Walter Blith advised that 
a law be enacted ‘“ whereby every landlord should be obliged 
. . . to'give him [the tenant] reasonable allowance for his clear 
improvements.” The bill of 1850 did not pass, but neither did 
itdie. Again and again similar bills were brought before Parlia- 
ment, and in 1875 an act was passed, which laid down the 
conditions for compensating the outgoing tenant, but unfor- 
1 Caird’s “English Agriculture in 1850 and 1851, p. 119... ?Ibid., p. 119. 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
    RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 341 
tunately no provision was then made to keep the landlords from 
requiring the tenants to contract themselves out of the right 
to claim compensation under the law, and while the law was 
beneficial in that it systematized and brought greater uniformity 
into the practice of granting compensation where tenant-right 
was recognized, it was not generally adopted. Even the author 
of the bill asked his tenants to contract themselves out of the 
benefits of the law which he himself had framed. 
In 1883 a new bill, the Agricultural Holdings Act, was passed. 
This Act contained a clause making it illegal for a landlord to 
contract himself out of the conditions of the law. The law of 
1883, with the slight modifications of the Acts of 1900, 1906, 
1908, 1913, and 1914, is still in force, and it will be worth while to 
examine it with considerable care. The law enables the tenant 
farmers to obtain from the landlords as compensation for 
improvements at the termination of their tenancies, “ such sum 
as fairly represents the value of the improvement to an incoming 
tenant.” 
The improvements for which compensation could be claimed 
under this law were divided into three classes. The first class 
includes all those improvements to which the consent of the land- 
lord is required if the payment of compensation is to be enforced 
by law. This class includes the following list of improvements : 
(x) Erection, alteration, or enlargement of buildings. 
(2) Formation of silos. 
(3) Laying down of permanent pasture. 
(4) Making and planting of osier beds. 
(5) Making of water meadows or works of irrigation. 
(6) Making of gardens. 
(7) Making or improving of roads or bridges. 
(8) Making or improving of watercourses, ponds, wells, or reser- 
voirs, or of works for the application of water power or for supply of 
water for agricultural or domestic purposes. 
(9) Making or removal of permanent fences. 
(10) Planting of hops. 
(11) Planting of orchards, or fruit bushes, 
(x2) Protecting young fruit trees. 
(13) Reclaiming of waste land.
-P-A-G-E-354

(14) Warping or weiring of land. 
(15) Embankments and sluices against floods. 
(16) The erection of wirework in hop gardens. 
[Norr. — The above are subject to the provisions given under the 
third class of improvements with respect to market gardens.] 
The drainage of land is put intoa class by itself. It is required 
that the tenant shall give notice to the landlord of his intention 
to construct a drainage system if he is to expect compensation 
under the law for his improvement. This notice must be given 
not more than three months nor less than two months before 
the beginning of the execution of the work, and during this time 
the landlord may, if the tenant has not in the meantime with- 
drawn the notice, “ undertake to execute the improvement 
himself, and may execute the same in any reasonable and proper 
manner which he thinks fit, and charge the tenant with a sum 
not exceeding five pounds per centum per annum on the outlay 
incurred in executing the improvement, or not exceeding such 
annual sum payable for a period of twenty-five years as will 
repay such outlay in the said period, with interest at the rate 
of three per centum per annum, such annual sum to be recover- 
able as rent. In default of any such. . . undertaking, and also 
in the event of the landlord failing to comply with his under- 
taking within a reasonable time, the tenant may execute the 
improvement himself, and shall in respect thereof be entitled to 
compensation ” under the Agricultural Holdings Act. 
The third class includes a large number of improvements for 
which compensation can be claimed under the law, without 
having gained the consent of the landlord or having given notice 
to him previous to the execution of such improvements. The 
list of improvements put into this class is as follows: 
(18) Chalking land. 
(19) Clay burning.

manure.

(24) Consumption on the holding by cattle, sheep, or pigs, or by 
horses other than those regularly employed on the holding, of corn, 
cake, or other feeding stuff not produced upon the holding. 
(25) Consumption on the holding by cattle, sheep, or pigs, or by 
horses other than those regularly employed on the holding, of corn 
proved by satisfactory evidence to have been produced and con- 
sumed on the holding. 
(26) Laying down temporary pasture with clover, grass, lucerne, 
sainfoin, or other seeds sown more than two years prior to the de- 
termination of the tenancy. 
(27) Repairs to buildings, being buildings necessary for the proper 
cultivation or working of the holding, other than repair which the 
tenant is himself under an obligation to execute. This, however, 
requires notice to landlord. 
In ascertaining the amount of compensation payable to a 
tenant, account is taken of any benefit which the landlord has 
given or allowed to the tenant for making the improvement. 
Also in case the tenant is under contract to return a certain 
amount of manure to the soil each year, and in case such amount 
shall not exceed the amount that is produced from the feeds 
which are produced upon the holding, this amount is excluded 
from the amount for which compensation can be claimed. 
In case the landlord and the tenant fail to agree as to the 
amount of compensation which the tenant should have for the 
various improvements which have been named above, the 
difference is settled by means of arbitration. 
In case of any breach of contract on the part of either land- 
lord or tenant, damages may be claimed by the party injured. 
Also in case the tenant causes or allows any waste, injures the 
soil, or destroys the improvements, the landlord can make a 
claim for payment for such injuries. These claims are arbitrated 
the same as those for improvements. 
In case of permanent improvements such as are not mentioned 
in either of the above classes, the tenant may remove the 
improvement unless the landlord may choose to buy the same, 
with the proviso that he repair any damages which may have 
been incurred by the removal of the building, that is, he must
-P-A-G-E-356
  344 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
leave the premises in as good ‘condition as if the improvement 
had not been made. 
It is the usual thing for the incoming tenant to pay the sum 
which is due the outgoing tenant as remuneration for improve- 
ments; and in case the new tenant remains but a short time 
on the farm, so that at the expiration of his tenancy he has not 
had time to realize in full upon such investments, he receives 
remuneration for such improvements just the same as if he had 
executed them himself. 
These are the essential points of the Agricultural Holdings 
Act of 1883 as modified by the later Acts. In 1908 two impor- 
tant additions were made to the law, the one relating to damages 
to crops from game, and compensation for unreasonable disturbance. 
The first specifies that damage to crops from game which the 
tenant has no right to take shall be compensated for by the 
landlord if the damage amounts to more than one shilling per 
acre of the area over which the damage extends. In order to 
receive compensation the tenant must give notice in writing to 
the landlord as soon as may be after the damage was first ob- 
served by the tenant and a reasonable opportunity given the 
landlord to inspect the damage. 
The second provides for compensation for unreasonable dis- 
turbance of the tenant who is removed by the landlord without 
good and sufficient cause or who finds it necessary to move 
because of demands for increased rents, demanded by reason 
of an increase in the value of the holding due to improvements 
which have been executed by or at the cost of the tenant, and 
for which he has not, either directly or indirectly, received an 
equivalent from the landlord. The tenant may claim compen- 
sation for the loss or expense directly attributable to his quitting 
the holding which he may unavoidably incur upon or in con- 
nection with the sale or removal of his household goods, or his 
implements of husbandry, produce, or farm stock on or used 
in connection with the holding. 
The law, as it now stands, seems to supply the regulations 
necessary to an amicable adjustment of the relations between 
landlord and tenant in England. 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  
  RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 345 
Tenancy from year to year is the rule in England to-day, 
and no question is raised as to the security of the landlord or of 
the tenant. Either party may bring the tenancy to a close at the 
expiration of any year, by giving proper notice. Under the 
act, twelve months’ notice is required, but by special agreement 
between landlord and tenant the time may be changed to six 
months. 
Written contracts are generally used, but the leading agri- 
culturists of the country agree that such contracts should contain 
few restrictions upon the methods of farming, except that the 
farm shall be operated in accordance with the rules of good 
husbandry. Many of the written agreements now in use would, 
if strictly enforced, bind the tenants hand and foot; but as a 
matter of fact many of these covenants are recognized to be 
obsolete and others are “winked at” by the landlords. A 
study of the written agreements nominally in force at the present 
time would, in themselves, give a very erroneous idea of the 
actual relations between landlords and tenants. 
The farmers and the landlords of England have quite gen- 
erally come to recognize that liberty and honesty are essential 
to success in agriculture. The writer gradually gained the 
impression by coming in personal contact with farmers and land- 
lords, or more often the agents of the latter, that accompanying 
the gradual perfecting of the Agricultural Holdings Act, there 
has been the growth of a sense of justice in the minds of both 
the landlords and the tenants. This sense of justice is all the 
more effective because it is accompanied by the belief that in 
farm management, whatever is beneficial to the farmer is like- 
wise advantageous to the landlord. 
The English method of regulating the relations between 
landlord and tenant is successful throughout Great Britain. 
The history of land tenure in Scotland would prove very inter- 
esting and helpful. Leases of long duration, most commonly 
for nineteen or for twenty-one years, have been in general use 
1 The Agricultural Holdings Act as now in force may be found in convenient form 
in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, third series, Vol. XI, 
Part III, 1900.
-P-A-G-E-358
  
  346 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
in Scotland for more than a century. The system of “ corn 
rents,” already referred to, proved an effective means of adjust- 
ing rents to prices at the time when this problem was proving 
disastrous to the long-term lease in England. At the present 
time the Agricultural Holdings Act of Scotland is practically 
the same as that in force in England. While it continues to be 
the custom among Scottish landlords and tenants to have long- 
term leases drawn, it has become the common thing to include 
a clause which makes it possible for either the landlord or the 
tenant to bring the tenancy to a close at certain periods, as for 
example, at the end of the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth year, or at the 
end of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., year, by giving proper 
notice to the other party. In effect, therefore, the long-term 
lease is passing away, for the same object is now attained through 
the Agricultural Holdings Act. 
In another connection the writer had occasion to publish the 
statement that, ‘“ the relation between landlord and tenant is 
very satisfactorily arranged, the farmers are, as a rule, contented 
with the present system, and the fields of England prove that 
landownership on the part of farmers is not essential to good 
agriculture.” This statement has occasioned surprise on the 
part of some American readers, but an eminent agriculturist 
of Great Britain, Mr. John Speir, says this statement “ expresses 
briefly and concisely the position here.” The writer had no 
thought of minimizing the importance of landownership on the 
part of farmers, but rather to emphasize that in spite of the fact 
that tenancy is the rule in that country, the agriculture of 
England is, in many ways, worthy of our emulation, and that 
this advanced position of English agriculture is due, in a great 
measure, to an excellent system of adjusting the relations 
between landlord and tenant. 
That Americans may profit by the experience of their British 
cousins should be evident from the foregoing pages. That they 
will be willing to draw upon the experience of the English will 
scarcely be questioned. The Americans have become inde- 
pendent in thought and action, and have become leaders in 
nearly every line to which they have turned their attention, 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
    RELATIONS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 347 
yet they have always been willing to accept all that is of value 
in the achievements of other countries, and we believe that as 
America has profited by the experience of the English in the 
development of factory legislation, so will she profit by a study 
of the English agrarian legislation.! 
CovENANTS FounD 1n Norrork Farm Leases, By W. MARSHALL 
[The following description of the Norfolk leases is taken from the 
second edition of William Marshall’s “Rural Economy of 
Norfolk” (1795), pp. 70 to 80.] 
The following heads of a lease will place the general management 
of a Norfolk estate in a clear and comprehensive point of view. They 
are not, either in form or substance, copied, precisely, from the lease 
in use upon any particular estate; but exhibit, I believe, a pretty 
faithful outline of the modern Norfolk lease. 
Landlord agrees, 1. To let certain specified premises, for a term 
and at a rent, previously agreed upon. 
2. Also to put the buildings, gates, and fences in tenantable repair. 
3. Also to furnish rough materials, and pay half the workmen’s 
wages in keeping them in repair, during the term of the demise; 
willful or negligent damage excepted. 
4. Also to furnish the premises with such ladders as may be wanted 
in doing repairs, or in preserving the buildings, in case of high winds, 
fire in chimneys, etc. (an excellent clause).

posts, stiles, etc., etc., in repair; or to furnish the materials ready 
cut out; tenant paying the usual price of labor for cutting out.

or his agent, shall direct to be made or renewed. 
Landlord reserves, 1. All minerals, fossils, marls, clays; with 
liberty to work mines, quarries, and pits, and to burn lime and bricks 
upon the premises; likewise to carry away such minerals, etc., etc. ; 
excepting such marl, or clay, as may be wanted for the improvement 
of the farm. 
2. Also, all timber trees, and other trees and woods, underwood 
and hedgewood; with liberty to fell, convert, char, and carry off 
such timber or other woods; excepting such thorns and bushes as 
shall be set out by landlord, for making and repairing fences; pro-

vided the thorns, etc., so set out be cut in the winter months; ex- 
cepting, however, out of this proviso, such few as may be wanted in 
the course of the summer months, for stopping accidental gaps. 
3. Also, full liberty of planting timber trees in hedges, or on 
hedgebanks; with a power to take to himself, after twelve months’ 
notice given, some certain number of acres of land for the purpose of 
raising timber trees, other trees, or underwood; allowing the ten- 
ant such yearly rent, etc., for the land so taken, as two arbitrators 
shall fix. 
4. Also, a power of altering roads, and of inclosing commons, or 
waste lands, without the control of the tenant; to which intent, all 
common-right is usually reserved, in form, though seldom in effect, to 
the landlord. 
5. Also, the customary liberty to view the buildings, do repairs, 
and, consequently, to bring and lay materials. 
6. Lastly, the right of sporting and destroying vermin. 
Tenant agrees, 1. To pay the stipulated rent half-yearly; and 
within thirty days after it be due; under forfeiture of the lease;

time, before the expiration of the term. 
2. Also, to do all carriage for repairs (within a specified distance) ; 
and to find all ironwork and nails; and to furnish wheat-straw for 
thatching; and to pay half the workmen’s wages, and find them 
with small beer. 
3. Also, to do all ditching, etc., set out by landlord (provided the 
quantity set out do not exceed one tenth of the whole); and to pay 
half the workmen’s wages, and find them in small beer; and to defend 
with hurdles, or otherwise, all such young hedges as shall be exposed, 
in spring and summer, to the browsings of pasturing stock. 
4. Also, to make, or pay for making, such gates, etc., as shall be 
wanted upon the farm during the term of the demise; and to hew, 
or to pay for hewing, all necessary gateposts; and to put down and 
hang, in a workmanlike manner, such gates and gateposts at his own 
sole expense; as well as keep all the old gates on the premises in 
tenantable repair. 
5. Also, not to assign over, nor in any other way, part with pos- 
session of his farm; but to make it his constant residence during the 
term of the lease. Nor to take any other farm; nor to purchase 
any lands adjoining, or intermixed with it; without the license and 
consent of landlord; under forfeiture of the lease.

6. Also, not to break up any meadow, pasture, or furze ground, 
under the penalty of ten pounds an acre a year. Nor to cut “flags,” 
that is, turves, under fifty shillings a hundred. : 
7. Also, not to lop or top any timber tree, under the penalty of 
twenty pounds; nor other tree, under ten pounds; nor cut under- 
wood or hedgewood (except as before excepted) under ten pounds a

etc., under five pounds a load. 
11. Nor to impair the foundations of the buildings round the dung- 
yard, by scooping out the bottom of the yard too near the buildings ; 
but to keep up a pathway three feet wide between the dungpit and 
the foundations (an excellent clause). 
12. Also, not to stock any part of the premises with rabbits; but 
to endeavor, as much as may be, to destroy them. 
13. Also, during the last two years of the lease, not to take in any 
agistment stock. 
14. Also, in the last year, not to suffer swine to go loose without 
being yoked and rung. 
15. Also, in the last year, to permit landlord, or incoming tenant to 
sow grass seeds over the summer corn; and to harrow them in, gratis; 
and not to feed off the young grasses after harvest. 
16. Also, in the last year, not to sow less than . . . acres of fallow, 
of, at least, three plowings and suitable harrowings, with two pints 
an acre of good, marketable, white-loaf turnip seed; and, in due 
time, to give the plants two hoeings (or, if the crop miss, to give the 
fallow two extra plowings) in a husbandlike manner; and, at the 
expiration of the term, to leave such turnips growing on the premises; 
free from willful or neglectful injury; under the penalty of ... 
pounds an acre. 
   
-P-A-G-E-362
  350 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
17. Also, to permit the landlord or incoming tenant to begin, on 
or after the first day of July, im the last year, to break up the two 
years’ lay (hereafter agreed to be left) for wheat fallow, or any other 
purpose; and to harrow, stir, and work the said fallows; and to 
carry and spread dung or other manure thereon, without molestation. 
18. Also, in the last year, to permit landlord, or incoming tenant, 
to lay up hay, or other fodder, on the premises, and to protect it 
thereon. 
19. Also, to lay up and leave upon the premises, at the expiration 
of the lease, all the hay of the last year (or of any preceding year, if 
unconsumed at the expiration of the term) except . . . loads, which 
tenant is allowed to carry off. 
20. Also, to lay up, in the usual barns and rickyards, the last 
year’s crops of corn; together with the tithe, if compounded for; 
and to thresh them out in proper season; and in such manner that 
the straw, chaff, and colder shall be injured as little as may be. 
21. Also, at the expiration of the term, to leave no less than... 
acres of olland [meadow-land, literally old-land], of two years laying 
(including that which may have been broken up by landlord or in- 
coming tenant) and which shall have been laid down in a husbandlike 
manner, after turnips or a summer fallow, with not less than twelve 
pounds of clover, and half a peck of ray grass, seeds an acre— 
under the penalty of . . . pound an acre. Also not less than. . . 
acres of olland, of one year’s laying, to be laid down as above specified, 
under the penalty of . . . pound an acre. 
22. Also, at the expiration of the term, to leave all the yard manure, 
produced in the last year of the lease, piled up in a husbandlike 
manner, on the premises; excepting such part of it as may have 
been used for the turnip crop; and excepting such other part as may 
have been used by landlord, or incoming tenant, for wheat. 
23. Also, at the expiration of the term, to leave the buildings, ladders, 
gates, fences, watercourses, etc., etc., in good and tenantable repair ; 
landlord in this, as in every other case, performing his part as above 
agreed to. Also, upon such parts of an estate as lie near the residence 
of the owner, it is customary for the tenant to agree to furnish an- 
nually, a certain number of loads of straw, according to the size of 
his farm; also to do the carriage of a certain number of loads of coal ; 
also to keep dogs, warn off sportsmen, and suffer them to be prose- 
cuted in his name: remnants, these, of the ancient base tenures of 
soccage and villanage.

Tenant to be allowed, 1. The full value of all the hay left upon the 
premises, of the last year’s growth, or of the growth of any preceding 
year; provided the quantity of old hay do not exceed . . . loads. 
2. Also, the full value of the turnips left on the premises; or the 
accustomed price for the plowings, harrowings, and manuring; at 
his own option. 
3. Also, the feedage of the lays broken up, by the landlord, or the 
incoming tenant, from the time of their being broken up until the 
expiration of the term the ensuing Michaelmas; also, for all damage 
arising in carrying on manure or otherwise. 
4. Also, the feedage of the young clovers, from harvest to Michael- 
mas. 
5. Also, the use of the barns and rickyards for summer corn until 
Mayday; and for winter corn until the first of July next ensuing. 
6. Also (by way of a consideration for the stover), the customary 
price for thrashing and dressing the corn; the landlord, or incoming 
tenant, also carrying the same to market, gratis: provided the dis- 
tance required to be carried does not exceed . . . miles, and the 
quantity required to be carried, at one journey, be not less than 
. coombs. [A coomb is equivalent to four bushels.] 
All the above allowances to be referred to two arbitrators; one to 
be chosen by each party, in Michaelmas week; and the amount 
awarded to be immediately paid down by the landlord, or the in- 
coming tenant.

  CHAPTER XXVI 
MARKETING FARM PRODUCTS 
The problem. Thus far we have studied the economic prin- 
ciples which underlie the activities of farmers in bringing agri- 
cultural products into existence. This is usually called the 
economics of production. We have also studied the economic 
forces which determine the share of the farm value of these 
commodities which goes to each of the’ factors of production, 
namely, as wages of labor, interest and depreciation on equip- 
ments, the rent of land, and the profits of management. This 
division of returns is usually called the distribution of wealth. 
We now turn to the problems of marketing. From one point 
of view marketing is a productive function because it adds place 
or time utility to commodities. From another point of view 
the economics of marketing is a problem in distribution because 
it has to do with the forces and conditions which determine how 
the dollar paid by the consumer is divided among the men who 
participate in the supplying of the article, from the farmer at 
the one end to the retail dealer on the other end of a longer or 
shorter line of middlemen. 
We are interested in marketing as a productive activity from 
the point of view of introducing economies into the system 
and thus reducing the cost of the service, to the benefit of all 
concerned. We are interested in the marketing problem also 
from the standpoint of establishing a just division of the con- 
sumer’s dollar among those who participate in providing the 
product at the point where the consumer gets it. This has 
been otherwise designated as a square deal. 
Direct sale. Some products are carried by the producer to 
the consumer. Milk sold in a small city is a good example of 
direct sale. Potatoes and garden truck are sometimes sold in 
352
-P-A-G-E-365
  MARKETING FARM PRODUCTS 353 
this way. In some places farmers carry their produce to a 
market place to which the consumers come to make purchases. 
These sales all imply close proximity of producer and consumer 
and hence are limited to goods produced in the neighborhood of 
where they are consumed. 
By means of public carriers such as the parcel post, the ex- 
press companies, and the railways, farm produce may be carried 
great distances directly to consumers. In this case there is, of 
course, one intermediate organization which, acting as an agent, 
renders a middleman service for a fixed rate of charge. 
Each form of direct sale has its difficulties. Where goods are 
carried directly to consumers the producer and consumer must 
in some way find each other and come to some agreement as to 
terms of sale. For example, a farmer who lives five miles from 
town has a few tons of timothy hay to sell. He telephones to 
the liverymen, the ice and coal men, the operator of the sand 
pit, because these men keep large numbers of horses. One 
liveryman is found who wants one load of hay and the sand man 
takes one load, but the roads are good, it is spring before work 
in the field has begun and other farmers are anxious to sell hay. 
So many farmers offer hay at the market price that the buyers 
believe the market will break. As a result the hay is left at 
the farm, the wagon stands empty, the horses stand munching 
hay in the barn, and the farmer turns to his wood splitting. By 
the next week the fields are dry and horses and men are pushing 
hard to get the oats seeded. Just when he has it figured out 
that he can finish a given field by Saturday night, the telephone 
rings and the sand man wants a big load of hay right away at 
the old price, of course, at which he did not care to stock up 
when the farmer was free to haul, for he is out of hay and must 
have a load. The farmer debates the matter in his own mind. 
Time in the field in oat-sowing is very valuable — possibly as 
high as two dollars an hour for a man and team. To haul a 
load of hay will take a man and team five hours, making an 
opportunity cost of ten dollars to haul the hay; whereas if the 
hay could have been hauled when field work could not be done, 
the opportunity cost would have been no more than a dollar. 
2A
-P-A-G-E-366
  354 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
The conclusion arrived at is as follows: I can’t leave my crop 
work to haul hay, for the number of days I can work in the field 
is very limited and I have planned all the field work which can 
be accomplished during the available time. Hence I had better 
sell the hay for much less and choose my own time for hauling 
it, but to sell it all and choose my own time I must have it 
baled and sell it to the feed man who will keep it in stock and 
sell it to the sand man when he wants it. Thus after some 
experience the thoughtful farm manager decides to abandon 
the direct sale of hay, and yet many of his neighbors sell hay 
direct and deliver it when it is wanted. Many market gardeners 
have tried hawking their goods on the streets, or standing in the 
market place awaiting customers. The main difficulty is that 
the time thus spent can be used more profitably by a good 
gardener working on his farm. The result is that the more suc- 
cessful gardeners decide to sell their produce wholesale and 
devote their energy to the problems of economy in production, 
leaving the retailing of garden truck to those who are at the 
same time retailing other things also and making a business 
of it. 
The milk business succeeds better on the direct sale basis 
for the reason that a line of customers can be secured who take 
about the same amount of milk from day to day. When the 
farmer’s milk wagon starts out each morning the driver knows 
where he is going and to whom the milk will be sold. If the 
route is badly scattered this becomes an expensive system, 
but for farmers living near the city there seems to be a profit. 
One of the main difficulties in delivering milk from the farm is 
the producing an even supply of milk for the trade. Some 
months too much is produced; other months not enough. 
The disposal of the surplus in the one case and the finding of 
means of increasing the supply at another time worries the 
farmer milkman, and in many instances makes him glad to leave 
the distribution of milk to a man who makes that his business. 
The larger the city and the farther the farmer has to drive in 
order to get to his customers, the more desirable it is to introduce 
the milk dealer, who is of course a middleman. 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  
  MARKETING FARM PRODUCTS 355 
Where distances are too great for the meeting of producer and 
consumer, direct shipment may be resorted to. Butter, eggs, 
poultry,and vegetables have been shipped to special customers. 
While this method has rarely proved cheaper than other systems 
because of the smallness of the shipments and the expense of 
the packages, yet it has proved a means of putting high quality 
produce into the hands of those who appreciate quality and are 
willing to pay the price. 
Sales to and through middlemen. The development of 
modern systems of transportation, the growth of great indus- 
trial cities, and the expansion of specialized commercial agri- 
culture has brought with it a complex middleman system which 
needs to be studied with care with a view to its better organiza- 
tion with a greater economy and justice. 
For some articles the market may be said to be world-wide, 
because the entire product is effective in determining the market 
price. This is true of wheat, wool, cotton, sugar, tea, silk, and 
many other nonperishable articles in general use. Liverpool 
has for a long time been the central wheat market of the world. 
Being a port situated on the outer edge of the wheat-deficit 
area of western Europe, Liverpool became the objective point of 
shipments of wheat from all wheat ports of the United States, 
Canada, South America, Australia, New Zealand, India, and 
Russia. In each of the countries producing a surplus of wheat, 
primary wheat markets were established such as Chicago, 
Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and many other points 
to which the wheat is shipped from the farmer’s local station. 
Thus there are many stages, many processes, and many middle- 
men between the wheat producer and the bread consumer. 
The local grain dealer buys grain at all times in any quantity 
and of most any quality the farmer has to sell. He holds it in 
his warehouse until he has a carload lot and then ships it to a 
primary market, consigning it to some commission firm at that 
point for sale. At this point the wheat may be milled into 
flour and by-products or it may be cleaned and graded and 
reshipped in the direction of the wheat-deficit areas of the world. 
, In either case, owing to the great distance, the wheat or its 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  
356 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
product — flour—is sold and resold many times, so that 
while many men handle the wheat many men own the wheat, 
so that there is always some one near who has a proprietary 
interest in the wheat. Do these men, each in turn, render a 
service? They do. Is this service rendered in the most eco- 
nomical manner and for a just charge? This question is not so 
easily answered, and here lies the center of the middleman 
problem. This is the real issue between the farmer and the 
middleman, — an issue which has not been well defined as a 
tule by those who have talked most about it.

THE FARMER AND THE MIDDLEMAN 
Dourinc the past ten years the marketing problem has come 
prominently into the foreground. To some it has appeared 
that the middleman is in a position to demand that his basket 
be filled without rendering a corresponding service. To others 
it has appeared that the present system of marketing is waste- 
ful of human energy because there are too many middlemen. 
There is truth in both of these suggestions, but, as often pre- 
sented by the cartoonist and by the excitement-loving editor, 
much besides the truth is conveyed to the reading public. 
Fortunately, while the earlier farmers’ conventions dealing with 
this problem indulged largely in emotions and sentiments, recent 
meetings of farmers give primary attention to fact and reason. 
Our pioneer forefathers were not confronted with the modern 
marketing problem. Their agriculture was conducted more 
largely with a view to the direct satisfaction of their own wants. 
With the cheap freight rates resulting from modern methods of 
transportation, agriculture has become commercial. The farmer 
produces primarily for the market, and the farmers of the dif- 
ferent parts of the country give a more especial attention to 
some one or two lines of production. For example, the Dakotas 
produce wheat; Iowa markets hogs and cattle; Wisconsin 
specializes in dairy products and potatoes; Texas sells cotton 
and cattle; and other states likewise have their specialties. 
Each state produces a large surplus of a few articles and must 
buy many articles from other states. It is the exchange of 
these specialties which brings the marketing problem into the 
foreground. 
Those who criticize modern commercial systems as wasteful 
are certainly not comparing the present system with that of the 
357
-P-A-G-E-370
   
      
358 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
self-sufficing economy of the isolated pioneer, but rather with 
some ideal which lies as a possibility of the future. Commercial 
agriculture, that is, production primarily for the market and 
buying upon the market many of the articles consumed by the 
farmer, is more productive because: (1) each agricultural 
territory can be devoted to the production of those articles for 
which it is by nature especially suited; (2) each man may devote 
himself to the lines of agriculture in which he is most effective ; 
and (3) the agricultural classes may benefit by the economies 
introduced into manufactures by machine methods and large- 
scale production. To appreciate the economic significance 
of the change from the self-sufficing to the commercial economy 
one need only compare the comforts enjoyed by the modern 
farmer with those of the pioneer. 
With this great advantage accruing to the farmer as a result 
of the commercial system, the question properly arises in your 
minds, what are the farmers kicking about? Why are they 
condemning the middleman who is essential to the commercial 
system? This is the question the writer will attempt to 
answer. 
In the first place there are men who make it their business 
to stir up trouble. These men take a few more or less well- 
established facts and by the free use of their fertile imaginations 
weave a fabrication which appeals to the avarice of men. It is 
popular in this type of agitation to make a statement somewhat 
as follows: “When the consumer pays a dollar, the farmer 
gets only forty-eight cents” ; and then with a rolling of the eyes 
and a stern, excited look intended to imply that he himself has 
seen many of the thieves, the speaker says, “ Who gets the rest? ” 
The reply desired is, ‘‘ the middlemen — the thieving middle- 
men.” 
But why do intelligent farmers listen to such foolishness? 
For a very simple reason. However intelligent they may be 
regarding farming, they are uneducated on the subject of middle- 
man processes and the costs of the middleman services. Their 
honesty and good faith in the matter is demonstrated, when, 
following in the wake of the “ middleman swatters,” the wily
-P-A-G-E-371
    
THE FARMER AND THE MIDDLEMAN 359 
promoters of creameries and farmers’ packing companies call 
upon them for liberal stock subscription, at least 173 per cent 
of which is available for paying expenses of promotion. 
The farmers know a great deal about producing cotton and 
wool and corn and hogs and wheat and cattle and dairy prod- 
ucts, but they know but little as a class about the functions of 
the middlemen, made necessary by the modern commercial 
organization of industrial society. The farmer takes cotton or 
grain, his hogs and his cattle, or his milk to the local market and 
surrenders them to the local buyer. Year after year he may 
see the train pull out of sight around the curve below the corner 
of his farm without any clear vision of what happens to his 
products from that point. 
In the main, the functions of middlemen are little understood 
by the producers or by the consumers. What is in the dark 
may be evil, and his human imagination is prone to draw gro- 
tesque pictures of what may happen in the realm of the unknown. 
Thus it has come to pass that the producer sometimes covets 
the whole dollar which the consumer pays for his products and 
looks with disgust at the fifty-two cents which he receives. 
This is a fertile field for sowing the seeds of discontent and there 
have been plenty of writers and cartoonists ready to ride the 
crest of the wave of popularity which has given prominence 
in recent years to the marketing problem. It is only recently 
that this onslaught has been participated in by the farmer. 
The farmers have in general maintained a passive part while the 
politicians and professional agitators have played the leading 
réle with the paid writers and cartoonists as emphatic seconds. 
The thing that is needed most at the present time is education 
on this question of middleman processes. It is not the writer’s 
purpose to imply that the producer is wrong in thinking there 
may be an injustice, but it is his purpose to say that the starting 
point in solving the marketing problem is not what may be 
imagined about middlemen but the actual facts about middleman 
services and middleman charges. This is a problem for the 
scientist. The scientific economist should turn on the light 
so that all may see the truth. He should study carefully and
-P-A-G-E-372
  360 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
describe accurately what happens to a product from the time 
it leaves the farm until it reaches the consumer. In the light 
of these facts intelligent and safe steps may be taken to improve 
conditions, whereas legislation striking in the dark stands great 
chances of doing harm and little chance of doing good. 
When the fog is cleared away the true character of the issue 
may come into view. It will be recognized that, in general, 
middlemen render a service. The real issue between the farmer 
and the middleman relates to the fairness of the charge made for 
the service. That more economical methods may be introduced 
at certain stages in the middleman process will be accepted 
without debate. A survey of the work of the middlemen which 
would show how to replan the route from producer to consumer, 
in such a manner as to shorten the line and reduce the number 
of stops and the amount of rehandling, should be acceptable 
to every one concerned. The wisest middlemen would be the 
first to accept the new economies. There is clearly no issue 
here between the middleman and the endmen. The real issue 
then is the fairness of the charge for the middleman service. 
This is an important issue from the farmer’s point of view. 
When considering the prices of the supply of farm products on 
hand at the end of a given harvest the farmer may be looked 
upon as the residual claimant. He gets what is left after all 
charges are paid. Every expansion of middleman charges, with- 
out added service for which the consumer pays, cuts the farmer’s 
income; every reduction in cost increases the farmer’s profits. 
When the consumer pays the retailer a dollar for potatoes, 
the dollar goes into the retailer’s cash register. The retailer 
may have to take eighty-three cents out of the till and pay it to 
the wholesale dealer. Other parts have to be taken out to pay 
store rent, clerks, taxes, delivery, etc., but we shall omit the 
details and follow the main course of the remnant of the dollar 
which works back from one middleman to another until the 
farmer is greeted with his residual share. The wholesaler 
takes out seven cents and passes seventy-five cents over to the 
jobber, who pays eight cents to the railway company and keeps 
five cents for his own service. This leaves sixty-two cents, 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
THE FARMER AND THE MIDDLEMAN 361 
  which is forwarded to the potato dealer in central Wisconsin, 
who takes ten cents for materials furnished (sacks, car linings, 
and heat) and services rendered. The cash register rings 
out 52 cents to the farmer, and the transaction is closed, and 
the question, Who gets the money? is answered for one specific 
case. Are all these charges fair? This is the real issue and 
of course the burden of proof is on those who raise the question. 
What is a fair charge? That, in itself, is not an easy question, 
but equally difficult tasks should carry equal compensation as 
nearly as possible whether it be farmer, manufacturer or mer- 
chant. It is usually considered that where free competition 
exists, prices tend to become fair. 
Special instances may be mentioned where unfair charges are 
likely to occur. ’ 
Along the railway lines in the grain-growing regions of the 
United States there are many country stations where one elevator 
can easily handle all the business. This elevator may be owned 
and operated by an independent grain buyer, interested in 
maximum returns for his services. It may be owned by a line 
elevator company and operated by their hired man, or it may 
be owned by the farmers who load grain at the station and 
operated by the employee of the farmers’ company. Either of 
these methods will usually provide the necessary elevator 
service. And it often happens that the same man will handle 
the grain. The question that interests the farmers is, How 
can we get this service performed satisfactorily for the lowest 
cost? Such a local elevator partakes of the character of a 
natural monopoly. If the independent operator is in charge, 
he can make a monopoly profit which looks large to the farmer 
and which attracts the attention of the grain merchants at the 
central market. To introduce competition into the charge 
made for this service, the independent operator is replaced by 
an employee who works for a competitive wage. Who, then, 
gets the monopoly gain which had formerly gone to the opera- 
tor? The employer, of course. If the line elevator company 
is the employer, the monopoly charge may be increased due 
to the elimination of the tendency for the operators at different
-P-A-G-E-374
  362 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
stations to compete for the trade in the middle zone between 
the railway stations. On the other hand, if the elevator is 
owned by the farmers, the monopoly gain is eliminated, local 
prices are increased, production is stimulated. Increased 
supply tends to lower prices to consumers and thus the benefits 
of codperative elevators are divided between the farmers and the 
consumers. 
Another example of what often appears to be an excessive 
charge for local middleman services is that found at the local 
stations in the districts from which potatoes are shipped. 
Upon visiting one of these loading stations one is first impressed 
with the fact that there are very many warehouses at each 
station and for this reason may assume that monopoly charges 
are impossible. As a matter of fact an excessive number of 
warehouses and potato dealers, as well as an excessive number 
of grocers in a small town, may result in price agreements, which 
give basis for monopoly charges for services rendered. It is 
believed by many that a condition of this kind has at times 
existed in the potato district of central Wisconsin. The method 
of eliminating this monopoly has been the introduction of the 
farmers’ warehouses, where the service is performed by an 
employee of the farmers, working for a competitive wage. 
It is well established that wherever there is a tendency toward 
a monopoly charge for a middleman service which is performed 
locally, where the farmer comes in contact with the warehouse 
and the man performing this service whenever he sells his prod- 
ucts, codperation is the natural and effective method of 
eliminating the monopoly charge and distributing the benefits 
widely through society. 
But there are other middleman functions which are not under 
the eye of the farmer. These are in operation at the central 
markets and beyond, and for brevity in this discussion will be 
called central market functions to distinguish them from the 
local market functions. Examples of the central market func- 
tions are the elevator business at the primary grain markets, the 
packing business, and the distribution of potatoes, dairy prod- 
ucts, and poultry. The problem of securing the services of the
-P-A-G-E-375
  
  THE FARMER AND THE MIDDLEMAN 363 
middleman in the central market at a fair price has not been so 
nearly solved as has that of the local market. Two methods 
have been tried, each with some degree of success. The one 
method is state regulation or control, and the other method is 
coéperation. Coéperation may be on the part of consumers 
who organize to reach out after their product, or codperation 
may be on the part of producers organized to reach out with 
their produce beyond the central market with a view to securing 
a higher price for their product. It is believed that both of 
these methods should be resorted to. 
Where there is a well-organized system of marketing capable 
of absorbing all of the product whenever shipped, as is true of 
the grain business and the packing business, it would seem that 
state or Federal regulation is the best method of establishing 
fair play. These are big businesses requiring much capital and 
special skill and carried on at such a distance that the farmer 
cannot supervise the work. He must trust the supervision to 
others. He may not have any too much confidence in the Goy- 
ernment, but experience will teach him that the Government is 
at least as trustworthy as any comprehensive organization 
which he can build to perform this function of securing fair 
play. 
Where there is no well-organized central market which will 
absorb all the product and send it on to its final destination, the 
local codperative company often finds it necessary to reach out 
long distances for a market. The potato market will serve 
as an example. The farmers’ produce company is in competi- 
tion with the big line companies both at the local stations and in 
the various cities throughout the country where the potatoes 
are consumed. The farmers’ company can handle the potatoes 
at the loading station appreciably cheaper than can the line 
companies, but in finding a market for the limited number of 
cars handled by one warehouse, in competition with the line 
companies which are handling from twenty-five to fifty times 
as many cars in a year, the saving is largely lost. It is believed 
therefore that the federation of local companies for the purpose 
of finding a market is a necessary step if local codperation is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  364 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
reap its reward in the marketing of potatoes. In general it is 
believed that where there are no well-established central mar- 
kets subject to Government supervision, farmers will have to 
look to federated local companies in order to compete success- 
fully in the distribution of their products. 
The success of the Wisconsin cheese producers’ federation gives 
ground for confidence in the ability of farmers to handle suc- 
cessfully the distribution of their products in distant markets. 
This organization has its headquarters at Plymouth, Wisconsin. 
Prior to its organization the farmers living in the vicinity of a 
cheese factory met once a year and hired a cheese maker to 
convert their milk into cheese at so much per pound. So far 
as could be determined the cheese maker did not get any too 
much for his services. But the cheese was sold on an unregu- 
lated market at a price which was unsatisfactory to the farmers. 
The farmers had little or nothing to do with the selling of the 
cheese. They left this function to the cheese maker, who had 
no interest except the getting all of the cheese passed as first- 
grade product, as he had agreed to stand the loss if the product 
was not up to standard. This led to many irregularities, and 
left the farmer in a position to take whatever was handed him. 
In time he complained, and with the help of the State Board of 
Public Affairs and the Agricultural College and the blessing of 
a local leader who was willing to work for nothing and board 
himself in good missionary fashion, these local groups of dairy- 
men who took milk to the same factory were converted into 
corporate units known as cheese producers’ associations. These 
in turn were federated into the cheese producers’ federation. 
This latter organization hired an experienced salesman to sell 
the product of over forty cheese factories. They were unable 
to rent space in the public cold storage warehouse of Plymouth. 
This emergency was quickly met by building a warehouse for 
their own use. Six seasons have passed, and the federation has 
proved an unqualified success. This gives ground for the belief 
that wherever the farmers have the right mettle they can 
codperate successfully to reach out into the central markets. 
In any case there is plenty of work for the state to perform in 
   
-P-A-G-E-377
    THE FARMER AND THE MIDDLEMAN 365 
solving the marketing problems. Local codperative companies 
would prosper better under state supervision, especially with 
respect to the auditing of accounts. Farmers’ federated com- 
panies are doubly in need of aid and supervision in order to 
succeed in their more difficult task. But a still more important 
function for public authority is the regulation and control of 
private corporations dealing in farm products in the central 
markets and beyond. 
It should not be assumed, however, that all charges are unfair 
and require regulation. Whenever middleman services are per- 
formed for a fair charge, and it is believed that this is true of a 
great part of the middleman functions, regulation by farmers or 
by government is but sand in the wheels of industry.

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 
In the preceding chapter attention has been called to the 
ways in which farmers may codperate and the ways in which 
governments may regulate the activities of middlemen with a 
view to securing fair prices for farm products. In this chapter 
attention will be given to the question of price regulation as a 
means of solving the marketing problem. 
Many who in the past have been satisfied to leave the fixing of 
prices of farm products entirely to competitive forces operat- 
ing under the law of supply and demand now see the need of 
commissions to adjust prices. The Price Commission, to be suc- 
cessful, cannot represent a class, but must stand for economic 
justice to all classes. The condition and needs of the producer, 
the distributor, and the consumer must be considered with equal 
care. The biggest problem in price-fixing is to get the facts 
needed as the basis of action. 
For many years the idea of price control has received the at- 
tention of farmers who have been hard pressed to make both ends 
meet. Dollar wheat sounds cheap now, but at one time it looked 
like a cure-all for the ills of the Dakota farmers. The control of 
cotton prices has often been talked about in times of low prices, 
and the price of Burley tobacco was more than doubled by the 
concerted action of farmers in holding their product and refrain- 
ing from growing a crop in 1908. In all this agitation it was 
argued that the price should be enough to pay the cost of produc- 
tion and a reasonable profit. This point of view stimulated in- 
terest in farm cost accounting as a basis for price-fixing. 
The United States Department of Agriculture and many state 
experiment stations have codperated with farmers in keeping 
detailed records of man and horse labor, the use of equipment, 
366
-P-A-G-E-379
         PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 367 
and other elements of costs, as well as the yield, in quantity and 
value, of each kind of product. Occasionally a farmer has under- 
taken detailed records on his own initiative and without official 
aid, but the clerical work necessary for keeping a complete sys- 
tem of cost accounts is more than most farmers have time to do. 
In the official promotion of farm cost accounting, the purpose 
has not always been well defined; but there have been at least 
two points of view. A position taken by many who are inter- 
ested in the marketing problem is that costs should be known in 
order that they may be used as a basis of price-fixing. A view 
held by men interested in the problems of farm management is 
that cost accounts show the relative profitableness of competing 
crops and live stock enterprises, and hence give the starting point 
for scientific farm management. 
It would seem that the Federal Food Administration in fixing 
the price of wheat, and the Chicago Federal Milk Commission 
in its work of the winter of 1918-19, assumed that cost of pro- 
duction is the foundation of price-fixing, yet when these officials 
have approached the final problem of. price-fixing, they have 
found themselves confronted with unexpected difficulties. 
Why all this difficulty in the use of cost accounts as a basis 
of price-fixing? There are doubtless many reasons, but there are 
three of unusual importance. First, variation in costs; second, 
joint costs; and third, disagreement in the elements of costs. 
But in spite of these difficulties, accounting may be used in price 
control. 
Variation in costs. There is a very wide range in cost figures 
secured by careful methods of accounting, and there are wide 
ranges in the estimates of costs by different producers. On the 
basis of a farm management survey made on 51 farms in one 
dairy district in Wisconsin, the return per dollar of annual out- 
lay ranged from 77 cents to $3.05. The results of the Wisconsin 
Dairy Cow Competition carried on in 1909-11 illustrated this 
point. The return per dollar’s worth of feed consumed by the 
398 cows in this contest varied from 92 cents to $2.71; the aver- 
age of the best ten was $2.38 worth of product per dollar’s worth 
of feed and the average of the poorest ten was $1.11.
-P-A-G-E-380
   
    368 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
With wide ranges in the costs of production, which cost shall 
be accepted as the basis of price-fixing? The average has been 
seriously suggested but abandoned in disgust when it has been 
realized that a price fixed on the basis of average costs would 
probably result in a loss on half the farms. 
The marginal or greatest costs have also been suggested. 
Economists have a theory that prices tend to equal marginal 
costs; this is thought to be true because it is assumed that the 
man who is producing at a loss will drop out, or, if the supply 
is short the price will rise to the point attracting others less fa- 
vorably situated to enter the same line of production, thus 
tending to maintain the price at a point equal to the greatest 
cost, though at any given time they might be far apart. There 
seems to be some relation, therefore, between the highest cost 
necessary to produce the desired supply and the price which in 
the long run will have to be paid in order to get the supply. 
Disagreements regarding cost factors. Determining the 
price at which to charge supplies produced upon the farm 
presents further difficulties in this regard. Shall feeds be 
charged at cost of production or at market price? In calculat- 
ing the cost of a 1918 corn crop, should the seed corn be charged 
at the cost of production or at the market price? A similar 
question arises with respect to seed potatoes. In figuring the 
cost of milk the question arises: Should the hay, the oats, and 
the corn produced on the farm be charged on the basis of cost 
of production or at the market price? There seems to be an 
accepted rule of accounting which gives definite directions to 
charge all the produced supplies at cost and not at market 
price. On the other hand, farm cost accountants connected 
with the United States Department of Agriculture and the 
various experiment stations have quite generally charged these 
produced supplies at market price minus the cost of delivering 
them to the market. 
A few years ago when the point of view was that of proving 
that dairying was profitable and an industry which should be 
stimulated by the press in every way possible, one agricultural 
paper held tenaciously to the old accounting rule of charging   
-P-A-G-E-381
  
  PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 369 
feed to the cows at cost of production because this magnified the 
profits of dairying by throwing the field profits into the dairy 
account. Now that the point of view has changed and the price 
of milk is looked upon as the objective point in cow cost account- 
ing, this same paper is definitely of the opinion that produced 
feeds should be charged to the cows on the basis of market price. 
It is not difficult therefore to understand why there should have 
been two opinions, on this point, before the Chicago Milk Com- 
mission. Each party accepts the rule of accounting which best 
serves his interest. 
If there were two methods of testing the amount of butter fat 
in milk, one of which favored the farmer and the other the pur- 
chaser, this same alignment of the interests would doubtless be 
formed. Fortunately there is one accurate fat test accepted by 
all, hence this occasion of trouble is avoided. What is needed is 
to settle this question in accounting in accordance with the 
economic principles underlying the case. 
Joint costs. The typical farm provides a much more difficult 
accounting problem than a sawmill, a flour mill, or a steel 
mill. The problem is more nearly comparable to that in railway 
accounting, where one expenditure affects a great number of 
sources of income. The farmer who produces but one crop is 
rare. On the typical dairy farm, corn, small grain, clover hay, 
and pasture, cattle, horses, and hogs are all produced. The 
same plows, harrows, and horses are used for the various crops 
which require attention at different seasons, and the same 
laborers are used for crops and live stock. When the corn is 
being cultivated the corn is not only benefited but the land is 
being put into better condition for the small grain crop which 
will be grown the next year. When the land is prepared for 
small grain the seed bed for the clover is being prepared, while 
oats or barley serves as a nurse crop for the clover plant, which 
in turn is able to draw upon the nitrogen of the air and provide 
plant food needed for its own growth and for the corn crop 
which is to follow. Hence the costs of these three crops are 
said to be joint costs. 
Under these circumstances, suppose it is found that the oat 
2B
-P-A-G-E-382
  370° AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
crop costs more than the market price, that the cost of oats is 
ten cents greater than the price. What can the farmer do about 
it? He can do a little figuring to see whether or not another 
crop which requires his attention at the same periods and which 
serves equally well as a nurse crop, barley for example, can be 
substituted with a profit or with a smaller loss. If not, should 
the farmer cut out the small grain crop? Usually not. The 
total cost of man and horse labor would be reduced little by 
omitting the oat crop, because oats and corn require labor at 
different seasons and are supplementary to each other. If this 
crop were not grown the hours of productive labor would prob- 
ably be reduced and the average charge per hour for labor 
applied to the corn would be greater. 
But this is not all. Oats are used as a nurse crop for clover, 
and while it may be possible to grow clover without a nurse crop, 
this would cost nearly as much as putting in the oats. Hence 
the growing of small: grain is usually the cheapest way to get 
a seeding of clover, and where clover thrives this is the best way 
to secure nitrogen for the corn crop. Thus it is the joint results 
of the joint costs which are important. 
Having adopted a system of farming, the parts of it should 
be adhered to so long as the system as a whole continues to be 
attractive, and so long as each part of the system continues to 
pay better than the substitute which is competing for a place in 
the system. 
The corn, oats, and clover combination is not a complete sys- 
tem of farming in itself. It is usually combined with one or 
more live stock enterprises. Beef cattle and hogs, dairy cattle 
and hogs, or straight dairying may be combined with this crop- 
ping system. In each of these systems there are many instances 
of joint costs. The joint cost of fattening steers and hogs is 
commonly understood among feeders. Where butter fat and 
pigs and veal calves are the products sold, these three products 
have elements of joint cost. Where pure-bred cattle and milk 
are sold the costs are joint and inseparable; the important ques- 
tion relates to the profit of the system as a whole. 
Where grade cows are purchased and used for the production 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  
  PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 371 
of city milk we approach more nearly to a specific cost of a spe- 
cific product as far as the live stock industry is concerned, with 
only a small by-product in the form of a veal calf. And yet 
this type of dairying has its costs intermixed with the system 
of cropping, notably in the use of labor, the use of crops, and 
the provision of fertilizer. Hence, in mixed farming, joint costs 
are present to block the effort to arrive at the cost of producing 
any specific farm product. 
Where two articles are produced as a result of the same work, 
the combined prices of the two tend to equal the greatest neces- 
sary cost of producing them, but the price of each article is 
determined separately on the basis of supply and demand. 
Consumers want a variety of things produced by the farmer. 
How much a consumer will pay for a given article depends upon 
the intensity of his desire for it. The intensity of this desire 
depends upon how abundantly he has been supplied. The more 
he takes the less he will pay for any given unit of the goods. 
Unfortunately, under conditions of joint costs there are certain 
physical facts which determine the ratios in which goods are pro- 
duced, without much regard to the ratios of the intensity of the 
desire for them. As a result the supply-demand price of one 
product may be higher and that of another lower than the cost, 
but the combination of crops may prove profitable. The case 
is similar to the situation in the oil business. Gasoline and kero- 
sene have a joint cost; and it is the condition of the market and 
the relative proportion in which they are obtainable at a common 
cost which makes the price of gasoline nearly twice as high as 
that of kerosene at the present time. 
Total farm profits and price regulation. When the point of 
view of total farm profits is accepted the problem becomes that 
of so regulating prices that the farmer in one line of produc- 
tion may reap as large a reward as he could earn producing 
some other product, or else of helping him in getting into some 
other line of production. By looking to total farm profits we 
avoid many of the difficulties arising out of differences in the 
costs of producing a given article by different men. Even if it 
costs one man 2 cents a quart to produce milk, another 3 cents,
-P-A-G-E-384
  372 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
another 4 cents, and still another 5 cents a quart in a given 
city milk belt, yet each of these men may be doing the type 
of farming which pays him best, and the industry may be stable 
so long as relative prices remain the same. Likewise the ques- 
tion of joint costs is avoided, for it is no longer a question of the 
cost of a specific product, but of comparing the total farm profits 
resulting from the various types of farming and from the dif- 
ferent competing elements in each kind of farming. Further- 
more, the question of charging feed at market price or cost of 
production would seem to pass with the effort to find specific 
costs. . However, something akin to this latter problem remains. 
The farmer may compare the profits he would make if he sold 
his corn, oats, and hay at present market prices instead of 
feeding them to cows and selling milk. In this he should not 
assume that if the community turned from milk selling to 
crop selling the prices of all these crops would be what they 
were before the change, neither should he assume that his 
crops would yield the same if he changed to grain growing 
for the market. Oats and corn are used directly for human 
food and have many other uses, and are so easily shipped that 
there would continue to be a market for them if not used as cow 
feed; but clover hay is a stock food and it is not so easily mar- 
keted. The important alternatives uses for clover if not used for 
cows are (1) to feed to beef cattle, (2) to sheep, or (3) to plow 
under as a fertilizer, any of which conserves its value as a land 
builder for grain growing. Where clover has entered into 
commerce it has usually been as a feed for dairy cows. When 
discarded for this use, therefore, the marketing of clover hay 
could not be counted upon. A farmer in the Chicago milk 
district, for instance, insists that it pays better to sell grains 
and plow the clover under than to make clover hay and feed it to 
live stock. He is practicing this system and is satisfied. In 
this and similar cases it is the alternative use value rather than 
cost or present market price which becomes the basis of compar- 
ing the profits of types of farming, and hence the basis of choice. 
This means that formally assigned specific costs are of little 
use in the discussion of price-fixing where the products in 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
    PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 373 
question are produced under condition of joint costs. It does 
not mean, however, that cost accounting is of no use in the study 
of this problem; in fact, accounts are very necessary, but in a 
different way from what has been supposed. Accounts are 
useful to the farmer in making choice of crops and live stock 
enterprises and his methods of production. Accounts are 
useful to the price commissioner in estimating the price necessary 
to call out continuously the desired supply of produce of a given 
kind and of suitable quality. For these purposes specific costs 
may not be needed. What are needed are figures comparing 
the profitableness of the different things to which the producer 
can turn his attention. The alert farmer is ever figuring on the 
combination of crop and live stock production which will pay 
him best with a given price schedule and with given costs for 
land, labor, and equipments. 
When the point of view in farm cost accounting is shifted 
from specific costs to comparison of profits the whole problem is 
much simplified. In the attempt to secure specific costs, ac- 
counts had to be kept in minute detail comprehending every 
activity and economic relation of the farm. As soon as one 
shifts to the point of view of comparing the profits of competing 
enterprises, no record need be kept unless the farmer really has 
a choice and then only such records as are essential to answering 
the question, Does this pay better than that? For example, 
the farmer in southern Wisconsin has a choice between growing 
oats and barley. In order to make a wise choice on this point 
it is not necessary to know the specific cost of growing either 
oats or barley. All that is necessary is to know differences in 
costs and differences in the value of the crops. In this case the 
same tools, machinery, horses, and men are used at essentially 
the same time of year whether the farmer grows the one crop 
or the other. These common items of cost may be omitted, for 
they cancel each other in the calculation. When put in this 
form the question is so simple that almost any farmer can figure 
it out on the basis of such facts as are easily available by keeping 
a production record and by studying price quotations. 
The milk producer has a number of ways of disposing of his  
-P-A-G-E-386
  374 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
product. He may sell whole milk to a city, or a condensery. 
He may take his milk to a cheese factory and carry home the 
whey, or he may separate the cream and sell it for city use or to 
a butter factory. If the milk is marketed through the cheese 
factory, hog production is introduced as a supplementary indus- 
try using the whey. If he sells cream, calf raising and pork 
production may be combined with dairying as a means of using 
the skim milk. All of these different types of dairying can be 
based upon the corn-oats-hay cropping system. The combina- 
tion a given farmer should choose depends upon which pays 
best under his particular conditions of production and marketing. 
The dairy farmer has, of course, other alternatives. He can 
change from dairying to beef and pork production, based upon 
the same field crops. Again, he can abandon cattle and hogs 
entirely, grow grain to sell and raise horses as a side-line to use 
up much of the unsalable roughage ; but in figuring the merits 
of this last system, influence upon fertility and production of 
grain per acre should not be ignored. He has the further alter- 
native of trying his fortune in the city, and this horn of the 
dilemma has frequently been the choice. 
With all these opportunities before them, the farmers are slow 
to shift from one thing to another in normal times because, for a 
given community, the question of what pays best becomes fairly 
well settled. Near the cities, whole milk of high quality is pro- 
duced under sanitary conditions of a higher standard than in 
other dairy regions. Outside of the milk zone there are scatter- 
ing cream shippers selected mainly with respect to the characters 
of the farmers participating. These are intermingled with the 
farmers producing for the creameries and cheese factories. The 
city milk zone becomes more or less well defined with the bound- 
ary line moving out a little farther in winter and contracting 
in summer, with a gradual expansion of the milk zone about a 
growing city. 
But in abnormal times, when radical changes are taking place 
in the prices of all these competing lines of production, farmers 
with their eyes upon the market become uneasy and unsettled 
in their convictions as to what to produce. The fact that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
    PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 375 
producer of city milk is getting more than he ever got before 
is not a sufficient consolation if he might be making more profits 
selling grain, hogs, and butter fat, in spite of the fact that he 
has gone to greater expense to equip his farm for meeting 
the requirements of the city ordinances. It is this unsettled 
condition which has given rise to the recent efforts to regulate 
prices. 
In deciding upon a fair price to the farmer on the part of a 
commission the alternative choices of the farmer become the basis 
for a rational decision. The industry should be made attractive 
to the farmer if he is expected to remain in it. But what is 
essential to make a given system of farming attractive? Must 
it pay some definite labor income to each farmer engaged in it? 
Apparently not, for as a matter of fact men are remaining in 
each type of farming who are making small incomes while others 
are making very large incomes. 
Whether or not a man should continue to carry on a given 
type of farming depends upon his opportunities in other lines of 
farming or other lines than farming. If there is no better out- 
look, if he is doing better than he could do in any other place, he 
will probably continue to produce the supply for the price he can 
get and look to methods of reducing costs as a means of increas- 
ing profits. If there is an alternative which will pay him much 
better, which should he do, ask that his price be lifted to the 
point where his present activities will pay as well as the alterna- 
tive or quietly choose the better paying activity? The answer 
is not so obvious as it might at first appear. Shifting is often 
expensive, and there is usually hope that conditions will change 
and the old line will again pay better. It often takes a genera- 
tion to build up a type of farming, and when the system becomes 
unprofitable a serious loss is suffered before readjustment can be 
made. Yet where permanent changes in market conditions have 
come about, changes in farming are necessary. Where read- 
justments should be made it is believed that public expenditures 
to aid in the readjustment, especially by means of educational 
campaigns, may often be more desirable than price lifting as a 
means of making the industry profitable.
-P-A-G-E-388
    376 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
Here is work for price commissioners well trained in agricul- 
tural economics, who will ascertain the true cause of price 
_ changes, make a study of the conditions of production, and advise 
the farmers in making readjustments in their farm management 
or in standing by their old lines of production as the case may 
warrant. In this work the price commissioner should not forget 
that the well-being of the farmer is just as important as that of 
the consumer, and that in the long run prices should be such as 
will make farm work and country life attractive. 
In carrying out this policy, price lifting may at times prove 
desirable. This is most likely to happen in case of articles like 
milk for which the price is more or less influenced by custom and 
which is often sold at the same price for long periods and which 
for this reason does not adjust itself quickly enough in times of 
radical changes in the general price level; but wherever isolated 
farmers in great numbers are acting individually in selling their 
produce to great corporations, need may often arise for price 
regulation by public authority to maintain the public interest. 
In deciding upon prices both the farmer and the price com- 
missioner should keep the long-time as well as the immediate 
effect in mind. It takes decades to build up the dairy industry 
in a community. Equipments require time for construction. 
Years are required to build up good herds, and decades are re- 
quired to train a whole community in the fine art of producing 
high-class milk. When such a community is diverted from 
dairying to another line of production, the farmers suffer a great 
loss while making the change and while adjusting themselves to 
new lines of production, after which they may again prosper. 
But if the farmers are needed to produce the supply of milk 
essential to the welfare of the people of the city, the loss of skilled 
dairymen will result in a heavy loss to the consumers, who will 
have to pay higher prices for milk, and probably find it neces- 
sary to lower their standards with respect to quality in order to 
get the necessary supply. 
Hence it is the long-time averages which must be considered. 
The records of one year may indicate that the profits would have 
been greater had the farmer been in another line of production, 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
  PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 377 
similar to that practiced outside of the city milk belt. In con- 
templating these figures, the farmer should look for the unusual 
conditions which have made this true. If the conditions are 
temporary he should hold fast to his present line and recall the 
years when his profits were much the greater because he was in 
the dairy business. 
If, however, it becomes apparent that permanent changes in 
market conditions have taken place which account for the change 
in profits, a move should be initiated to bring about a readjust- 
ment of the farming to suit the new market conditions; possibly 
some dairymen should change to other lines of production. But 
this is not a matter for hasty action, especially in the case of the 
dairy industry, where public welfare is at stake and where a 
change has far-reaching effects through a series of years. 
Changes which the farmer may make in grain production or 
hog production may be quickly readjusted, but not so with milk 
production. One’s ill feelings towards other people should not 
enter one’s decision. One should not get angry and sell his herd 
of cows. Cold reason should form the basis of judgment. It 
is easy to disperse a good dairy herd, but it takes years to rebuild 
it. A much safer plan is to cut down a little on the number of 
cows by culling-out the less profitable ones and to sell some 
grain or hogs in addition to milk rather than to make a radical 
change in type of farming. 
If the profits of milk production are temporarily low on a 
large share of the farms in a given city milk belt, due to short 
crops of grain and hay, which for this reason must be shipped 
in at heavy cost, the farmer should not only look to the long- 
time average, and to the maintenance of his market, but he 
should recognize the occasion of his loss, namely, the short crop, 
and should lay this loss to the land or to the way he has handled 
his land and not ask that the consumer should pay the rent on 
the land which did not produce the feed and also pay for the 
purchased feed. 
' The farmer should not be too insistent upon the consumer’s 
price varying exactly with his costs from season to season and 
from year to year. Custom is a big item in determining what 
   
-P-A-G-E-390
  378 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
people will eat. So long as prices are the same the customer is 
not likely to change, but every time the consumers’ price changes, 
consumption customs are shaken; and the more violent the 
change the more likely the custom is to be upset. It is not only 
the industry, then, but the market which may be damaged by 
impassioned actions. 
Just as it is by comparing profits that the farmer makes choice 
of types of farming, so it is by comparing prices in the market 
that the consumer makes choice. If it is done in the right way, 
the price of one commodity may be raised as rapidly as that of 
its substitute. So long as relative prices are the same, the 
choices may be expected to be the same. If, however, much 
publicity of an antagonistic sort accompanies the change in the 
price of one article while the change in another is accompanied 
by shrewd advertising which wins the sympathy of the con- 
sumer, there may be a falling off in the demand of the former and 
an increase in the consumption of the latter. 
Price commissions should make a careful study of the amount 
and character of the product demanded at various prices and the 
character and amount of the product which can be secured at 
these prices, and adjust the price on the basis of maintaining an 
equilibrium between demand and supply through a long period. 
In doing this, account will need to be taken of the substitutes 
to which the consumer may turn, as well as profits in other types 
of farming to which the milk producer may later change if the 
price is fixed too low compared with other prices. 
The forces and conditions which determine supply and demand 
are too little understood. The law of supply and demand as a 
price regulator does not always give satisfactory results. It 
might be made to work much more equitably under the guid- 
ance of a commission than when influenced by the unequal 
bargaining power of great distributing corporations on the one 
hand and of the isolated producers on the other. 
A properly organized permanent price commission might 
inaugurate an educational program which would improve the 
mutual attitude of mind of the producer and consumer toward 
each other, which would make each more considerate of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
  
  PRICE-FIXING AND THE COST OF FARM PRODUCTS 379 
rights of the other that are in the long run fundamental to the 
interests of all concerned. 
Furthermore, such a commission, well informed with regard 
to the facts of production, distribution, and consumption, would 
form a desirable medium for collective bargaining between the 
organized producers on the one hand and the organized distrib- 
utors on the other, which appears to be the logical outcome of 
recent tendencies and which would appear to be desirable 
wherever large numbers of isolated farmers are selling to large 
corporations such as the milk distributors in the large cities, the 
packers and the grain dealers, and possibly in many other in- 
stances. Even where the more specific functions of price-fixing 
are unnecessary, there is an important work for price commis- 
sioners in studying market conditions and the conditions of 
supply and in educating both producer and consumer to rational 
action. 
Statistical and historical methods of studying prices in their 
relation to production will prove valuable to price commissioners. 
Cost accounts are useful but should be supplemented by statis- 
tical studies showing the effect of various price relations upon 
supply and upon demand through a series of years. It will be 
desirable to use every method of research known to economic 
investigators in arriving at sound bases of judgment in the 
control of prices.

  CHAPTER XXIX 
THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE! 
THE growth of national wealth makes possible improvements 
in the conditions of life in the farm home and in the rural com- 
munity. The tendency has been for the various modern con- 
veniences to be introduced more slowly in the homes of the 
farmers and in the social life of the rural communities than in the 
more densely populated centers. This is true partly because of 
the greater opportunity for human contact in the cities than 
in the country, partly due to the fact that some of the city 
conveniences can be provided more economically on a large than 
on a small scale, and partly to the fact that farmers who have 
been prosperous and gained a competence have too often given 
their attention to buying more land rather than to the im- 
provement of the conditions of life in the home and in the 
social group. 
Leaders like Sir Horace Plunkett have emphasized that with 
“better farming and better business ” should go “ better liv- 
ing.” The natural opportunities for a full life are better in the 
country than in the city. It is now practicable to bring into the 
rural homes the conveniences which make for comfort. The 
possibility of organizing social life in the country in a satisfactory 
manner has been demonstrated by many communities. 
In order that greater progress may be made in bringing about 
conditions of “ better living” in the country the conditions of 
farm life are being studied with a view to helping farmers in 
their efforts to reach out for the better things of life. 
Rural hope. The progress of the land worker up the ladder 
of financial independence is marked by a continual struggle on his

part, both with forces within himself, which he often fails to un- 
derstand and control, and with the forces of the outside world 
which limit his actions in striving for success. He encounters 
subtle resistance at every step on his way, yet he is able to rise 
from the position of hired laborer to that of tenant farmer, from 
the position of tenant farmer owning the equipments to that 
of owner of the land and possessor of the profit, from isolated 
farmer to member of an organized economic group. 
Is there equal hope for the development of the social side 
of the farmer’s life? Is there opportunity for growth in the 
cultural, educational, religious, and esthetic aspects of the life 
of the farmer and his family, commensurate with its economic 
progress? It is the aim of this chapter to set forth the elements 
of the social side of farm life, so as to disclose the basis of rural 
hope. 
The Country Life Commission. In 1908 Theodore Roosevelt, 
then President of the United States, appointed a commission on 
country life, for the purpose of gaining such information and 
advice as would enable him to make recommendations to 
Congress in the interest of better country living conditions. 
President Roosevelt’s letter appointing the commission affords 
a good introduction to the study of the social side of our farm 
life, as in fact it may be considered the beginning of the country 
life movement in America. The following sentiments from 
the letter form a significant admission that the social side of 
farm life, as a national problem, has lain outside the line of sight 
of farmer, on the one hand, and statesman, on the other: 
“The social and economic institutions of the open country 
are not keeping pace with the development of the nation as a 
whole. . . . The farmer must first of all grow good crops in order 
to support himself and his family. But when this has been 
secured, the effort for better farming should cease to stand 
alone and should be accompanied by the effort for better business 
and better living on the farm. . . . Agriculture is not the whole 
of country life. The great rural interests are human interests, 
and good crops are of little value to the farmer unless they open 
the door to a good kind of life on the farm. . . . Howcan the life   
-P-A-G-E-394
   
    382 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of the farm family be made less solitary, fuller of opportunity, 
freer from drudgery, more comfortable, happier, and more at- 
tractive? . . . How can life on the farm be kept on the highest 
level? . . . How cana compelling desire to live on the farm be 
aroused in the children that are born on the farm? . . . All of 
these questions are of vital importance, not only to the farmer, 
but to the wholenation. . . . Thereisnomore important person, 
measured in influence upon the life of the nation, than the 
farmer’s wife, no more important home than the country home. 
. . . The farmers have hitherto had less than their full share of 
public attention along the lines of business and social life. 
There is too much belief among all our people that the prizes 
of life lie away from the farm. ”? 
In response to President Roosevelt’s letter, the Country Life 
Commission made an analysis of the main deficiencies in country 
life, and suggested remedies for the deficiencies. Three impor- 
tant recommendations were handed to President Roosevelt. 
First, a recommendation was made for a comprehensive plan of 
study or survey of all the conditions that surround the people 
who livein the country. The commission suggested that federal 
and state governments, agricultural colleges, other educational 
agencies, organizations of various types, and individual students 
of the problem be brought into codperation for the great work 
of investigating with minute care all agricultural and country 
life conditions. 
Second, a campaign for rural progress was mapped out. The 
commission believed there should be held state and national 
conferences on rural progress, designed to unite the interests of 
education, business organization, and religion into one forward 
movement for the rebuilding of country life. 
Third, according to the recommendations of the commission, 
each state college of agriculture should be empowered to organize 
as soon as practicable a complete department of college exten- 
sion. The work should include such forms of extension teaching 
as lectures, bulletins, reading courses, correspondence courses, 
demonstration, and other means of reaching the people at home 
1The Report of the Country Life Commission. 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  
  THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 383 
and on their farms. It should be designed to forward not only 
the business of agriculture, but sanitation, education, home- 
making, and all the intimate interests of country life. 
National attention centered upon the farm family. The 
report of President Roosevelt’s Country Life Commission in 
December, 1908, although not acted upon by Congress as the 
President had looked for, aroused universal interest in country 
life. The press was quick to give wide publicity to topics which 
had never before found a place in magazine or daily. State 
conferences on country life matters, drawing together rural 
people, were called at agricultural colleges, state universities, 
and normal schools in nearly every section of the United States. 
Farmers’ organizations, religious bodies, and business clubs 
were centers for the discussion of this new subject. From 1909 
to 1914 city dailies, national magazines, and country weeklies 
devoted constantly increasing space to country life progress. 
In 1914 the tragedy of the World War, however, quickly reduced 
the space given by the press to the social side of farm life, and 
forced the food side of farm life into greater prominence. 
However, the agitation of conference, pulpit, and press during 
the five years succeeding the report of Roosevelt’s Country Life 
Commission report left a distinct trace in American thought. 
National attention was turned to the human beings on the farm 
and to farm life institutions. There was at once an arrest of 
flippant talk about the farmer and his family. Country foibles 
ceased to be the butt of jest, and earnest effort was started to 
understand social conditions surrounding the land worker. 
After the first crop of superficial opinions and remedies, came 
a determination to study seriously all phases of human life as 
related to the farm. Commissions were appointed in the field 
of rural religion, rural education, rural health and recreation. 
Colleges appointed instructors in rural life, and “ rural sociol- 
ogy ” became a claimant for a place among the sciences. A 
group of young rural socio-economists developed. Theological 
curricula began to give attention to the “ rural church.” State 
boards of education began policies of redirection of rural 
schools. University extension work added the “farm house  
-P-A-G-E-396
    
384 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
and home ” to its projects, and agricultural colleges and religious 
bodies took the first “ surveys ” of rural life. 
Broad interpretation. To thinking people the country life 
movement is not in any sense a literary revival of the poetic 
appreciation of nature, the open road, the pictured sky, and the 
tural landscape. Nor is it a philanthropic enthusiasm with an 
“ uplift ” motive. The country is not a national, out-of-the-way 
slum to be cleaned out. Neither is the movement a conscious 
class struggle of farmer against townsman. 
But rather this new movement is to be interpreted as a creed, 
a belief, if you please, that country life has latent social forces 
which are susceptible of development; that reorganization of 
rural forces in such manner as to replace poorly adjusted social 
relations with natural and logical adjustments will free the 
farm population for a full and fair life. Those most closely 
in touch with the new rural hope believe that national life, yes, 
even urban life, will be equally benefited by a development 
and reorganization of country life and its institutions. How 
far this rural hope, aroused by the country life movement, is 
justified by the facts of country life, labor, and struggle, it is 
our purpose to determine in the topics which follow. 
Rural investigations. The Country Life Commission, in its 
list of deficiencies, gave prominence to “ a lack of knowledge on 
the part of farmers of the exact agricultural conditions and possi- 
bilities of their regions. . . . The time has now come,” the 
report reads, ‘‘ when we should know in detail what our agri- 
cultural resources are. . . . We cannot make the best and most 
permanent progress in the developing of a good country life until 
we have completed a very careful inventory of the entire country. 
. . . This would result in the collection of local fact, on which we 
could proceed to build a scientifically and economically sound 
country life.” 
The chairman of the Country Life Commission had been an 
exponent of agricultural surveys for nearly two decades. It 
was but fitting that he should be the person to sound the note 
for country life surveys and expound the survey idea as applied 
to the social side of farm life. In 1911 he set forth the following 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  
  THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 385 
general ideas on the scope and character of rural survey work: 
The real rural survey, he stated,'should be a slowly and studiously 
made record, rather than a mere exploration, an inspection, a 
canvass, ora campaign. It was his belief that any lighter efforts, 
however necessary for temporary uses, belong to a different order 
of inquiry. Then, too, according to the chairman, the survey 
should be strictly scientific in spirit, taking account of every 
significant fact, wholly apart from bias in the mind of the sur- 
veyor, the goal being the making of a record of the entire situ- 
ation, and the telling of the whole truth, in order to accumulate 
a substantial body of fact, so that every community might build 
its life upon the fact of the community. It was the plan of the 
chairman that these surveys should be made by many agencies, 
such as colleges, schools, departments of agriculture, and experi- 
ment stations, assisted by societies, churches, welfare agencies, 
and individuals, all working under a plan of codperation.! 
Some rural surveys. In response to the policy of study, in- 
vestigation, and survey set forth by the Country Life Commis- 
sion, “an agricultural survey ” in 1911 in Tompkins County, 
New York, although devoted mainly to labor-incomes, took 
stock of certain country life features, and pioneered the way 
in survey making. Consideration, for example, was given 
women farmers. Their labor incomes were compared with the 
labor incomes of men. Their help problem on the farm was 
inspected. Their total opportunity was assessed. 
To take another instance, the farm near town or city, as a 
residence, home, and side occupation for people in town or city 
occupations was considered. The opportunity for a lawyer, 
teacher, mechanic, and the like, to live in the country, operate 
a farm, and still carry on work in town was estimated on the basis 
of the instances encountered. 
The value of good country roads was not allowed to pass 
unnoticed. The empty houses in the country were explained, 
interpreted, and differentiated from abandoned farms. 
An interesting correlation was made between the education 
and labor incomes of farmers in Tompkins County. A high school 
1L. H. Bailey, “The Survey Idea in Country Life Work.” 
2c
-P-A-G-E-398
  386 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
education in this area of investigation was apparently equal to a 
$6000 bond bearing 5 per cent interest. Younger farmers, how- 
ever, did not seem to be more highly educated than their elders. 
A remarkable series of “ Rural Life Surveys,” made from 
the point of view of the church, in Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, 
Maryland, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and other states, began 
to appear in 1911 and continued through a period of several 
years. In each state selected several counties were surveyed, 
generally by townships. The economic conditions, the general 
character of the population, the social mind (involving communi- 
cation, community manners, meetings, amusements, families, 
codperation, organizations), clubs, education, recreation, morals, 
religious conditions and activities, social welfare (involving 
public health, distribution of wealth, community improve- 
ments), maps and charts, are all included in the wide array 
of topics taken up by these studies. Photographic illustrations 
of bad and good conditions appear frequently in the pamphlets. 
This series of surveys has had a wide influence, especially in 
focusing attention upon bad rural conditions, and leading 
people to a program of rural progress.” 
Some significant township social surveys have been made by 
various universities and colleges. These cover the range of 
social, religious, educational, health, and economic conditions 
in a general way, and mark the beginnings of serious effort to 
correlate the facts in the whole field of country life.* 
A few educational studies covering the rural school situation 
in a state have been published by departments of public instruc- 
tion, state universities, and colleges of agriculture.*

    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 387 
Health surveys are just starting with expert investigators 
behind them. The units of measure are so well standardized 
that rural health studies may be looked for in increasing 
numbers. 
Many rural community surveys have been attempted, but 
very few have been published. A community survey of tenancy 
here and there has shown the way to specialization in the study 
of farm life.t Interesting school district surveys have been 
taken by country children and teachers. Several analyses of 
counties into communities by a process of survey have dis- 
played the close relation of farm life and village, town, and city 
institutions.? Beginnings have also been made in tracing out 
county government budgets to locate the effectiveness of 
official service in the county form of government.* 
A codperative plan of national research. Country life has 
justified itself by these initial studies as a field worthy of investi- 
gation. These surveys, although made in limited areas of the 
United States, and carried on without regard to concerted 
action, have proved stimulating and have awakened the hope 
that a national plan of research may soon be set in motion. 
The pressing need now seems to be for a determination of the 
most significant problems which are susceptible of study in the 
life of our farm populations. These problems should be stated 
in standardized form, and then more or less uniform methods 
of study should be agreed upon for general use.4 
A federal bureau of country life research would facilitate 
the adoption of standard problems, methods, and a concerted 
movement nation-wide. 
The United States census of population. To know the move- 
ment of populations is a desideratum from many points of view. 
Heretofore the census has given us two main classes of popula- 
tion, the rural, the urban. The urban population, broadly

  388 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
speaking, has included all persons living in incorporated places 
of 2500 people or more; the rural population includes all persons 
living outside urban territory. The movements of the popula- 
tion engaged in agriculture have not been a matter of plain 
scientific disclosure by the census, but rather an estimate wrung 
from the classifications “ rural” and “urban.” All the figures, 
on “rural decrease” of population and on the gradual but 
strong migration of “rural ” people toward cities fail to give 
the exact facts about people living on the land as land workers. 
It is futile to build up permanent theories upon the movement 
of farm population until we have census data upon farm popu- 
lation as clean-cut as we possess about the population living in 
cities of 100,000 people. 
If the census could classify our population under three 
heads, namely, city population (setting up a standard of 
population for a city), village population (setting up a standard 
of population for a village), farm population (population living 
on farms), we would have the basis for a scientific calculation of 
population movements, and we should begin to know exactly 
about “ decreases ” and “ increases ” and direction of “ migra- 
tions ” of our land dwellers. It would be a source of valuable 
knowledge on farm problems, moreover, to be able to dis- 
criminate village population from farm population. The 
relationships between village and farm require this discrimina- 
tion, rather than the merging which we have at present. 
Village problems on the human side are quite distinct from 
farm problems. In fact, village psychology, village institutions, 
village government, village abnormality, and the like, justify 
separate research methods and separate treatment. 
The census should become the great basal source of research 
in country life problems. And it will take its place and function 
in this respect just as soon as the foregoing threefold classifica- 
tion of population is standardized. Then a series of tabulations 
on literacy, illiteracy, age groups, color, nationality, sex, marital 
conditions, in respect to each of the three classifications, would 
give the initial materials for further research.

    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 389 
Reorganization. The country life movement is now at the 
stage of reorganization. Old institutions are being subjected 
to close inspection with a view to adapting them more perfectly 
to present conditions. New institutions are being proposed 
to give a better channel of life to the farming group. Methods 
of rural organization everywhere occupy the center of attention, 
Some urban institutions, likewise, are in process of adjustment 
to newly recognized rural relations. Economic problems of the 
farm in some cases wait upon the reorganization of the institu- 
tional life of farm and town. A survey of the problems of 
organization will disclose to a close observer the profound 
character of the attempt thoroughly to organize the human side 
of farm life. 
The farm household. Family life in the farm household at 
once engages the thought of those who would modernize living 
conditions in the country. A general opinion obtains that the 
American farm family is restless, no sooner getting settled 
upon a piece of land in a community than it opens the doors to 
floating suggestions of a better farm, a more favorable com- 
munity, a more congenial climate, elsewhere. Not that out- 
and-out endeavors to shift from farm to farm are started; but 
that the American farm family always views shifting as within 
easy range of the possible. So owners of farms in America are 
not viewed as rooted and grounded in any particular community 
to be transplanted with the same difficulty as a massive oak. 
Farm tenants, moreover, are proverbially mobile, shifting, cut- 
ting and trying from farm to farm, and from community to 
community. 
To this instability of the American farm household has been 
ascribed the undeveloped character of rural institutions. If 
all farm families, even the leading ones, are shifting, then per- 
manence, long-time policy, lavish attention, are impossible in 
behalf of the institutions and organizations surrounding the 
household. How to stabilize the farm home, therefore, without 
rendering it immobile, is a problem of the first class, possibly 
incapable of solution until tenancy shall have received prolonged 
codperative study and shall have been taken up more elaborately
-P-A-G-E-402
  390 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
into public policy. A hope exists that tenant shifting may 
be much decreased by a simple knowledge of the social forces at 
work, and an application of methods of social control. 
There is a suspicion, moreover, that instability in rural family 
life may be related somewhat to the ideal of “ getting on” 
materially, or as the farmer views it, “ getting out of debt.” 
The mortgage on the farm is the strong bond of household 
partnership. Every one works to burn the mortgage; every- 
one, moreover, overworks; and even if an actual obsession does 
not completely control the whole family, too often so large a 
preponderance of attention is given to production, profits, 
savings for the mortgage, that the home spirit is driven from the 
fireside. Deep sentimental attachments to the house as a human 
habitation, to the farmstead as a spot sacred to the anniver- 
saries and traditions of the family, frequently do not develop. 
When the mortgage is burned, the work bond is broken, the 
compelling motive is withdrawn, and the family is susceptible 
to new ideas of speculation or of a premature retirement from 
an overcrowded economic life. If it has not been completely 
smothered in the days of debt paying, the home spirit may 
arise from the ashes of the mortgage, and new life may come to 
all the inmates of the home, and life as a goal may be counted 
more valuable than the material basis of producing. The new 
spirit will gently lead the human beings where the old ideal 
whipped the toilers to the field. When the mortgage bogie 
is once driven from the American farm household, a calmer spirit 
of stability, a firmer attachment to the spot where life is lived, 
will ensue. 
The mortgage bank with long-term loans, fair interest rule, 
and very gradual payment of the principal, will do much to 
drive away the “ get out of debt quick ” specter from the soul 
of the farm home. Life, human life, then will more and more 
become the motive of country living. 
The problem of the farm household will not be solved until 
there appears among its members an appreciation of the finer 
things of life. This needed appreciation will come increasingly 
as the farm housewife is freed from drudging toil, as the farm 
   
-P-A-G-E-403
    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 391 
child is allowed to get in touch with a larger cross section of life, 
and as the farm father grows to feel on easy terms with the 
business men of his community. 
One strong influence leading to hope and appreciation in the 
home will be a policy of screening off from the house and home 
view, with objects of beauty, the more vulgar aspects of farm 
work, necessary as they may be. Walls, trees, hedges, vines, 
have always been used as screens, more or less, about the house. 
A public policy to this effect would make the practice more gen- 
eral. All pictorial representations of farm life in advertisements, 
in books, in magazine articles, in wall decorations, would do a 
service to the life side of the farm household if they were to put 
forward the best, the ideal indeed, rather than the common 
realistic instance in posture, garment, gait, and use of hand 
implements. 
There is one reservation to be made in regard to the reorganiza- 
tion and socialization of the farm household. America will 
demand that no scheme of organization of the farm home shall 
endanger the stamina of the farm family as a basal unit of the 
nation. No social progress would be worth while at the price 
of a weakening of the family tie on the farmstead. The final 
statement, therefore, of the farm household problem is how to 
give the farm family the higher goods of life in much larger meas- 
ure, and how at the same time without fail to maintain the 
present bond of virility in the family unit. 
The neighborhood. Family life in the country is environed 
with neighbors. As in biblical history, the drama of life on the 
farm is played by father, mother, sons, daughters, servants, 
and neighbors. The neighborhood is a unit of loose organiza- 
tion. However, its bond of cohesion, racial, topographical, or 
institutional, is usually very real and admits of tightening. 
“ Good neighbors,” “ accommodating neighbors,” “ neighbors 
you can depend on,” are phrases which indicate the tie of 
organization. “ Gossipy neighbors,” “slippery neighbors,” 
“rough neighbors,” indicate a deficiency in organization. 
The fact is that scientific farming needs neighborhood spirit, 
enterprises, and mechanism of organization. Technical co-
-P-A-G-E-404
392 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
operation depends upon neighborliness, and good neighbors. 
Common policies with respect to the territory of the neighbor- 
hood, the institutions of the neighborhood, the roads of the 
neighborhood, imply a degree of intensive organization. 
The problem of organization of this territorial unit which 
stands above the farm household involves, first of all, a some- 
what official or at least standardized recognition of neighbor- 
hoods in the county. In fact, investigation is very much needed 
at this point in order to locate these population groups which 
are not bounded by statute lines. A map of a county containing 
all the neighborhood groups discoverable would go far toward 
clearing up and making standard this unit. It is quite probable 
that the neighborhood population group, which has the flavor 
of spontaneous choice about it, is one of the most important 
groups for organization and social utilization in farm life. 
How shall this unit be integrated into modern rural county 
organization? Is it most naturally a school group? A co- 
operative group? A farmers’ club group? A neighborhood 
house group? 
It is perhaps idle to let the fancy go upon this problem without 
considerable study of the social texture, psychology, and eco- 
nomics of the neighborhood. Very little as yet has appeared, 
either in literary or survey form, upon this feature of farm life. 
Some few settlements, school districts, villages, some few moun- 
tain clans, have been described; enough in fact to substantiate 
the claim that every county is packed with socio-economic 
population groups of this character. It is greatly to be desired 
that some responsible investigating agency should give us a 
study of some county and make such an analysis as will etch the 
neighborhood group into our geographic sense. Not till this 
study has been made can the problem of organization even be 
stated. 
The business community. As the farmer becomes increas- 
ingly a business man, it is of growing importance that he should 
be a recognized member of some one business community. 
Business is interlocking. The mercantile business, the manu- 
facturing business, the farming business, are fit subjects for 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
  THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 393 
closer mutual organization, but from the point of view of 
country life, the first essential is that the farm shall be unmis- 
takably linked with a particular local community of business 
enterprises. The farmer needs the esprit de corps of business 
associates, not only in farming, but in the other lines of 
business throughout his local community. 
From being a solitary seller of farm produce and buyer of 
the raw materials which enter into his farm products, to being 
associated with the farmers of his neighborhood in selling and 
buying, is a considerable step; but this sort of business associa- 
tion falls short of ranging oneself with the business men in 
general of a considerable village or small city trading center. 
The farmer’s kind of business is worthy of being represented in 
the local business group. The modern farmer is personally 
worthy of this association. Moreover, the community of 
business in town and on farm has a unity of purpose, territory, 
institutions, ideals, which logically demand that every farmer 
of hope recognize himself as a member of the business group and 
assume all the responsibilities of his common business citizen- 
ship. 
The time has passed when a modern farmer can evade his local 
responsibilities as a business man with the plea that he can go to 
several trading centers at will, for he can and should choose his 
main business center and business associates. The time, also, 
has gone when the mercantile and professional business 
men of a village or city can ignore the outlying farmer as a 
community partner in business enterprises on the ground that 
he is not a voter in the village or city. The right attitude of 
farmers and townsmen is based upon the fundamental fact 
.that most villages and small cities in America have fixed agricul- 
tural land bases, and that farm and town belong to each other. 
The problem of reorganization of the business life of the farm 
involves on the social side the distribution of American popula- 
tion into rather definite population groups of town and terri- 
torially associated farms. The sooner a farmer knows his 
business groups and stands loyal to his group, the sooner a 
community spirit will arise which will react upon the farmer’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  304 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
habits of life and thought. A great service remains to be done 
through some sort of official mapping of these community groups. 
Whether a closer legal relation, such as some form of municipal 
government, will ever obtain between the territory of farm and 
adjacent town, it is premature to surmise. The feud between 
farmer and townsman, although of long standing, in fact dating 
back as far as the independent stride of the one, and the suave 
speech of the other, is not without its history of truce and honest 
endeavor to come to terms of community understanding. 
The endeavors of many commercial clubs, boards of commerce, 
business men’s associations, town and country clubs, to bridge 
the gap between town business and farming furnish grounds for 
the belief that some general and final agreement will prove 
mutually satisfactory. 
Educational institutions. If real hope is to enter country life, 
considerable reorganization of the rural channels of education 
will be necessary. Some expansion in their ideals of education 
will need to come to farmers. There will be required also on 
the part of townsmen some recognition that education, high 
as well as low, is a legitimate privilege of the country dweller. 
Some further adaptation of educational curricula to the voca- 
tion of farming will have to be made. In fact, if the farmer’s 
family is to be a candidate for a life of culture, refinement, and 
skill, the doors to right training must be opened wide, and this 
means schools, large schools, high schools, vocational schools. 
The problem of schools, — that is, the problem of leading 
children into the world’s experience before the child has had 
his own experience, — is wrapped up in the whole problem of the 
social side of farm life. Not until the farmer has some abate- 
ment of his timidities and senses his ability to use large units, 
will he rise to the ideals of education for his children. Not until 
he gets over the feverish obsession for clearing the debt off 
the farm, and substitutes life as a goal, will the farmer come into 
the full fruition of this educational hope. When the household 
régime is enriched by a neighborhood régime, and this is sup- 
plemented by community organization, education will pre- 
sumably receive a large impetus. 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
  THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 395 
The deficiencies of the country school have been generally 
perceived, and the remedies are fast being applied. One 
question, however, still remains unanswered: whether the 
larger country school of the consolidated graded type shall be 
organized with little regard to the larger community of business, 
or whether it shall be an integral part of a community system, 
leading up to a community high school offering vocational 
courses. Perhaps this undetermined question is fundamentally 
a problem of democracy, and may be stated thus: shall the farm 
child grow up in an educational democracy, or shall he be 
trained in a group of farm children, somewhat aloof from the 
children of tradespeople, artisans, professional people? 
It may be that the country school which shall be organized 
with respect to natural population grouping will be found to be a 
school of large neighborhood, and contain only, or quite largely, 
farm children; but it may also be found that it is wholly within 
one business community, and is correlated with a local commu- 
nity high school. 
The problem of educational organization will have one im- 
portant question to determine, namely, whether the farmers’ 
high school shall be apart in the open country, or whether it shall 
be democratic and be located in a town center. Both farmers 
and townsmen are parties to this problem. The nation demands 
workable democracies; but it also demands that each class of 
workers shall be so protected that neither they nor their work 
shall suffer. If a democratic high school can be operated so 
as to be fair at every point to farming as an occupation, and to 
farm people as a class, then a high school in town will be no 
more objectionable than a bank in town. But if such a high 
school shall act practically as a sponge to take up the children 
from the land and squeeze them into the city for life, then a 
high school in the country will be the chosen alternative. 
Business institutions. How far can the farm get on without 
the traditional mechanisms of economic exchange? Is the 
retail town a necessity for farming? Or could farmers better 
do with the mechanisms of a metropolitan trade center, mail 
agencies, parcels post, express, freight? ‘These are questions
-P-A-G-E-408
  396 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
which arise for academic debate, and many farmers act in their 
trade as if they had come to a decision in the matter. Are new 
mechanisms of trade required to displace the retail store of the 
town? Should farmers band together in buying and selling? 
How completely should this policy, already tried a little, be 
applied? Should there be farmers’ mechanisms for selling, 
but not for buying? For selling all their products, but for 
buying only such raw materials as enter into their agricultural 
product? Could the community trading town compromise with 
farmers in trade matters to, this extent, that it would agree that 
farmers should operate in town selling exchanges, shipping 
agencies, produce exchanges, etc. on the condition that the 
farmers’ buying agencies would deal only in articles which enter 
into the agricultural product, such as lime, fertilizer, seeds, 
feed, farm implements, etc.? Under the latter plan, the town 
retailers would furnish at retail all domestic goods, clothing, 
household furniture, groceries, meats, jewelry, etc. Would this 
be an equitable bargain between town and farm? 
These are some of the questions of organization of community 
farm business. Experimentation is going on continually with 
all kinds of trade arrangements and trade mechanisms. It 
should be remembered, however, that the social side of farm 
life depends upon community spirit, good will, democracy, 
institutions, loyalty. The winning of the struggle to achieve 
economic freedom and national codperation among farmers 
should not be construed by the farmer as a release from the civic 
and social duties of community life. The problem of business 
institutions and mechanisms, therefore, resolves itself into the 
devising of ways and means for building up community life 
through a system of integrated social channels and mechanisms 
of business. 
From this viewpoint, the farm bureau shows promise of 
developing the educational, agricultural, and business interests 
of farmers, and preserving lines of community loyalty in a 
county. When the farm bureau shall be completely incor- 
porated into county government, so that the electorate of a 
county has control of the policy of the bureau as fully as it has 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 397 
control of education in the county school system, then perma- 
nence of organization will give chance for a democratic develop- 
ment of the principles and methods of farming. 
Even though it is difficult for the farmer to have a primary 
interest in the educational side of farm bureau work, only a 
slight shift of emphasis need be made among the objectives of 
the farm bureau to put the educational and social features into 
a position of favor. For example, the farmer will always have 
to sell his product. His interest in marketing, therefore, is per- 
manent and continuous. Suppose the farm bureau commission 
of the county, elected or appointed, make selling of the county 
farm products a primary objective; creating the necessary 
voluntary shipping associations; relating the products of every 
community to these associations; then every farmer in the 
county would become interested in the farm bureau. It would 
be an easy step, then, from selling to the formulas of agricultural 
production. Standardization of quality and the methods of 
high yields would then be logically related to the farmer’s 
prime interest. Social projects, clubs, roads, fairs, fétes, would 
follow these other interests. It remains for some organizing 
genius to work out first the business mechanism of the farm 
bureau idea so as to relate it to the electorate of a county; 
secondly, to make marketing a primary object; and thirdly, 
to correlate government extension service, both educational 
and social, with each community. 
Social institutions. The bright things of life which produce 
the happier moods, the pleasant emotions of contrast, variety, 
and the like, have often been mentioned as lacking in country 
living. The tail of work is always attached to the farm kite of 
play. Writers have become accustomed to load the odium of 
many other defects upon this outstanding trait in rural char- 
acter. “ Bring about recreation, amusement, the wide and 
frequent contact of personalities in country life, and,” it is 
said, “‘ farm life will be rehabilitated.” 
We have by this time found out that country life, and labor, 
are by no means without their own manner of complexities; 
and that these complexities are by no means set in sequence
-P-A-G-E-410
  398 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
like ten-pins. The problem is not to knock down one pin and 
see the others tumble. Rather, country life is a fabric, all 
elements interwoven, the whole hanging together. It is a long, 
arduous task to remake the fabric. It is no easy matter to 
bring social pleasures within the pale of country living, and cause 
the whole of life thereby to be quickened. But the problem 
of social institutions, however difficult, must be faced, sooner 
or later, in order that the more genial side of life may have its 
rightful chance in country living. 
Larger schools, providing age-groups of children who possess 
similar experiences, ambitions, and joys will start institutions 
for recreation. Farmers’ clubs, junior clubs, young folks’ 
clubs, are good agencies to give the initial impulse toward 
permanent forms of recreation. Home-made entertainment 
will always prevail in the country, and a modicum of organiza- 
tion of the younger persons will result in social enterprises. 
The present wide-spread impulse to build neighborhood and 
community houses will, it is hoped, materially accelerate the 
coming of the lighter and brighter things of country life. It is 
to be hoped that in our larger towns the Y. M. C. A. and 
Y. W. C. A. buildings, especially their gymnasiums, may be 
open for the use of near-by country youth, and that the plan 
of interchange of hospitality between groups of young people 
in town and country may be widely adopted. High school 
pupils and teachers in a town high school have the opportunity 
of setting the fashion in the larger community of exchanging 
hospitalities with country schools. Municipal club-houses 
and theaters have already been successfully managed for town 
and farm people. Community fairs, too, have taken high rank 
as rural social institutions. 
The real problem of rural social institutions, after all, is to 
discover natural population groups, and then find out how to 
create the mechanism for democratic recreation within a whole 
group. 
Religious institutions. The modern view of rural progress 
had some of its first apostles among those interested in the 
country church. The threatened decadence of church life, 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  
  THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 399 
if not of religion, in the open country, startled church leaders. 
So earnest has been the endeavor to meet the rural church 
problem that the several national religious bodies have created 
a department of church and country life, with a secretary or 
superintendent. A staff of rural church thinkers has been 
formed. Very positive plans to study the country church, 
to reparish the farm population, to provide noble church edifices 
and comfortable parsonages, to organize church congregations 
for social service as well as for social religion have been set 
forth. The auxiliary societies of the Y. M.C. A. and Y. W.C. A. 
have undertaken the work of training for rural leadership in 
county after county. The Federal Council of the Churches of 
Christ in America has its commission of the church and country 
life, which is entering upon a vast plan in connection with the 
Interchurch World Movement to survey the rural churches of 
America. 
No other type of farm institution has displayed so patently 
as the church the maladjustments of human life on the farm 
under the stress of a national tide flowing cityward. It is not 
strange, therefore, that the first questions were about the decay 
of the rural church. Not strange that all sorts of proposals 
and remedies have been made to improve the condition of 
country churches. 
An important problem of the church for farmers is un- 
doubtedly connected with the question of permanent agricul- 
tural population groups. A church in order to function must be 
in a natural population group. But a far deeper problem 
than this presents itself. Churches in modern times must 
reach a certain minimum strength in order to succeed at all. 
This minimum strength is at present frequently never reached 
by individual churches. How to guarantee the irreducible 
minimum strength to each country church amounts to an 
enigma. In solving this problem, moreover, some arrangement 
must be arrived at among the national religious bodies by which 
a process of give and take, carried out with scientific inter- 
change, shall enable these country churches to come up to 
standard membership. There are many indications that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  400 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
national leaders of different denominations are not only alive 
to the case as a problem of academic importance, but that they 
are determined, both from motives of national patriotism and 
from motives of a deeper spirit of Christian concession, codpera- 
tion, and unity, to work out a solution. 
Health institutions. An inspection of the hospital records 
in small cities will in certain sections of the United States dis- 
close a surprisingly large use of hospital facilities by near-by 
farm families, especially in surgical cases. The hospital, 
general and maternity, should doubtless be extended into rural 
territory for common use. 
The country nurse is proving a welcome visitor in rural 
schools and communities, and bids fair to become the founder 
of an institution. If the Red Cross Association could be 
persuaded to take over permanently as its “after the war” 
field of activity, the rural sections of the United States, and 
become an agency for rural health and home service, the rural 
health problem would practically be on the road to solution. 
Governmental institutions. One of the largest rural social 
problems pertains to the local government of farm population. 
The forms of government now prevailing in townships, counties, 
magisterial districts, and parishes, should be inspected and 
refitted to modern conditions. Reorganization is needed. 
Very few attempts have been made to take the primitive tools 
of rural government and replace them with machines for social 
purposes. A commission in every state appointed to study 
local government and present amendments would help solve the 
problem of rural governmental institutions. 
Here is where the farmer should be presented with his chance 
to have a democracy if he so desires. New England already 
knows the values of a township democracy of farm and village 
or farm and city. Perhaps other sections of the United States 
are ready to amalgamate farmer and townsmen in some form 
of local municipality. If the farmer, however, shall prefer a 
municipality made up of farmers alone, even then, contrary 
to general belief, considerable reorganization will be necessary 
in order to give him the right population group of farmers for

    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 401 
strong local government. The present territorial units of rural 
government, so far at least as they concern farmers, are, on the 
whole, deficient in social cohesion. So reorganization will be 
necessary under whichever theory prevails, — democracy of 
farm and town, or detached farmer municipality. 
The farmer is ready for a set of governmental powers which 
shall enable him to accomplish in his own group what cities 
are enabled to accomplish by charters for their population 
groups. There should not be a period of long waiting until 
the farmer demands this reorganization himself. The nation 
needs this rural reorganization. This is demand sufficient for 
thinkers and statesmen. 
Theory of organization. Social organization will proceed 
as has been indicated upon one of two theories, or upon a com- 
promise between the two. These two opposing theories should 
be plainly known and reacted to. 
The first, and it is the traditional theory, is that farm life, 
so far as possible, should for whatever purpose be organized 
by itself, aloof from the people of other industries, professions, 
or trades, who for the most part live in cities and villages. 
The second theory, and this is of recent origin, is that farm 
life is only a part of national life, and more like than unlike all 
the other parts, and should for democracy’s sake be organized 
along with these other parts within a natural community popu- 
lation group. Just as the nation is.a thorough-going democracy 
of all kinds of occupations, represented in Congress and public 
offices; just as the state is a pure democracy of farmer, in- 
dustrialist, and professional, so the local community should 
be a pure democracy. How a compromise may be effected, 
combining the principles of detached farm life and a pure 
democracy, some communities can already show. 
Rural legislation. The signs of hope for country life are 
seen to advantage in recent attempts to put into statutes 
freedom of action and power for farmers to employ the taxing 
device and other modern social instruments. County agri- 
cultural schools figure among the early endeavors to give priv- 
ilege to rural folks. The county nurse is likely to become man- 
2D 
   
-P-A-G-E-414
  402 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
datory upon counties. The introduction of mounted state 
police, as militia for the protection of open country populations, 
having given demonstration of usefulness in a few states is being 
encouraged in legislatures of other states. Electrification of 
township units seems likely to raise up a rural utility under 
municipal control. Village and city rest rooms for country 
people coming in to trade have become compulsory in one state. 
This plan has its angles of interest and suggestiveness; the 
village or city must appropriate a certain amount of money 
for rest-room maintenance, whereupon the state adds a like 
amount. 
Road legislation, frequent and even startling, is recognizing 
more and more rural population groups. The trunk line idea, 
however, good and fundamental as it is, needs to be linked up 
with the community roads plan, whereby the retail trade popu- 
lation of villages, towns, and small cities are integrated and 
their institutional purposes are facilitated. It is not too late 
in the newer sections of the United States for legislation to 
encourage the establishment of “ residence roads,” that is, the 
selection of certain favorably situated roads pertaining to a par- 
ticular trading center, upon which most of the farm residences 
of settlers shall be located. Residence roads would save much 
mileage of highly surfaced roadway, bring farming people into 
closer neighborhood contact, and facilitate school transporta- 
tion, and other institutional development. 
Redistribution of rural routes. The farmer appreciates his 
postal service; in fact he appreciates this daily delivery of mail 
so much that he is slow to complain of any flaws in the present 
system. One defect, however, sooner or later he will point out. 
Just because he is becoming a business man along witha partic- 
ular group of business men located in and around a particular 
business center, he is going finally to object to having for his 
mailing address, a little town or hamlet to which perhaps he 
seldom or never goes. A closer application of the principle of 
integrating the farmer with his own natural population group 
will be requested of the government in distributing the rural 
routes.
-P-A-G-E-415
    THE SOCIAL SIDE OF FARM LIFE 403 
One of the latest movements in country life legislation per- 
tains to the creation of new types of territorial districts. The 
legalizing of consolidated school districts, in shapes fitted to 
topographical conditions; and the forming of high school 
districts which unite village or city limits to surrounding farm 
territory for an educational democracy are among the efforts 
of rural life to stretch its boundaries in order to accommodate its 
expanding institutional consciousness. 
New types of municipality. One state has actually em- 
powered its rural people to create a new type of rural munici- 
pality out of any number of school districts. This statute stands 
as a weathervane, showing the way the wind is blowing. A 
desire for an easier position, for a better attitude for working 
together, for a broader base for social operation and for selec- 
tion of the right people to codperate with, — this is the meaning 
of the uneasy twisting and wriggling of rural populations. 
In another state, villages have for many years been enabled 
by law to build and maintain by tax a community house; like- 
wise cities; also the rubber-stamp square townships. But 
certain farm population groups lying in parts of two or more 
townships also desired community houses. So a bill was framed 
and introduced into the legislature, permitting parts of town- 
ships to be formed into a municipal district for the building and 
maintenance of a community house; not only parts of town- 
ships, but parts of townships along with a village or city; and 
even a ward of a city alone, or along with parts of one or more 
townships. The only requirement is that the territory shall be 
compact, at least sixteen square miles in area, or containing a 
population of at least 500 persons. 
Rural planning and land policies. “ Rural planning” is a 
present popular subject for debate in legislative halls. A state 
commissioner of rural planning and county boards of rural 
planning form the heart of the program. The commissioner 
of rural planning should be a specialist on the esthetic side of 
country life. He should see the streamside possibilities, the 
country park sites, the scenic effects which could be worked 
into the highway system. Standards of landscape beauty for
-P-A-G-E-416
404 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
public and private use would be the outcome. These things 
will without doubt eventually be provided for in statutes. 
Land policies of great scope and influence upon country life are 
bound to be more and more the subject of legislative enactment. 
Legislation, if well considered, will rest upon investigation, 
study, research. It is a very hopeful sign that an American 
Association for Agricultural Legislation has been formed, to 
furnish an impetus toward legislative study, publicity, and 
wise enactment of law. A fundamental doctrine of true popu- 
lation grouping seems needed most of all. Following this, 
surveys may establish the location of these groups. Institutions 
will thereupon spring up within these groups, and relations will 
be established between group and group, making it possible 
for the farm population to be connected vitally with the currents 
of national life and progress. Hope, culture, and privilege 
will thus follow freedom and the instruments of freedom.

  CHAPTER XXX 
METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC 
QUESTIONS 
In the preceding chapters it has been assumed that the 
farmer possessed the knowledge essential to the passing of 
judgment upon the relative profitableness of crops, the best 
method of disposing of crops, the choice of livestock enterprises, 
and the choice of agencies of production with respect to kind, 
quality, and the amount of each. A perfect knowledge on these 
points will never exist ; the problems to be solved always involve 
the future with its unknown factors to lend uncertainty. It is 
true, however, that a better knowledge of past results and 
present conditions add greatly to the accuracy of judgments 
regarding what to do in managing a farm or in planning legis- 
lation affecting agriculture. 
Our knowledge of the character of economic forces comes 
through reasoning based upon the available facts. In economics 
as in other sciences, the work of the student consists in gathering 
facts, sifting and classifying them, formulating hypotheses, 
gathering more evidence with which to test the tentative con- 
clusions, until all the relevant facts have been considered and the 
correct conclusions drawn. Through these processes it should be 
possible in time to approximate the truth regarding the operation 
of particular economic forces. But the economist is never 
certain of having considered all of the facts, and he is ever 
hoping to formulate a new hypothesis which will more completely 
explain the evidence in his possession. 
Theoretical work in general may be divided into two classes, 
the sterile and the fruitful. The sterility of the theories of the 
one class is usually due to failure to see the problem in its entire 
setting. The conclusions are sterile, as a rule not because of 
405
-P-A-G-E-418
  406 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
illogical thinking, but because the premises are incomplete and 
the conclusions therefore erroneous. The fruitfulness of the 
other class of theories is due to the fact that they are in harmony 
with the facts and become a guide to the mind in comprehending 
the direction and strength of the forces with which the practical 
man has to deal and hence increase the accuracy of his judgments 
regarding the probable conditions of the future with which he 
has to make his present actions harmonize. 
The danger of holding to half truths is very great in the field 
of economics. The forces involved are so numerous and the 
facts so scattered that even the most careful student is in danger 
of placing too great reliance upon a premature conclusion. And 
yet practical men everywhere are constantly dealing with 
economic forces. Day after day they are passing judgment 
on the future action of these forces. Practical business men 
often show a clearer grasp of the operation of economic forces 
than do the economists of the chair. This is because the 
business men are dealing directly with these forces. 
The student must study economic forces in operation if he 
would understand their character. The world of economic 
activities should be the laboratory of the economist, and the 
records of these activities should constitute his library. The 
success of the student depends equally upon his ability to gather 
data and his ability to draw correct inferences. It may be 
true in some subjects that a person who is not capable of drawing 
conclusions will be able to work independently and contribute 
to the subject by gathering data which others may use, but in 
the field of economics the problems are so complex that in order 
to secure valuable results the two processes must be employed 
simultaneously. No student should undertake independent 
research work in economics who is not a good logician. He must 
be capable of correct reasoning. He must be capable of drawing 
the right inference from given facts and of remembering the 
limitations of the basis of his reasoning. When a working 
hypothesis is formulated, it should be looked upon as a means 
to an end, not as an end in itself. In other words, he must 
be capable of independent work in the field of economic theory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-419
  
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 407 
Possessing this qualification, the student should devote most 
of his time to gathering data which may form the basis of 
generalizations regarding the character and operation of eco- 
nomic forces. 
There are many ways of securing information on which to 
base judgments on economic questions relating to farming. 
The farmer learns from his own experience. He observes the 
activities of others. He talks with his neighbors about which 
crops pay best, which methods of disposing of crops pay best, 
the proper wages for hired help, methods of renting land, and 
every other question which may arise from time to time. This 
accumulated knowledge is of very great importance to any 
farmer coming into the neighborhood to take up farming. 
In recent years personal and neighborhood experience has 
been made more available than formerly by means of the farm 
survey method of studying local farm management problems. 
The farm survey has stimulated farm bookkeeping, which has in 
some instances developed into a detailed set of records com- 
plete enough for cost-accounting purposes. These methods of 
studying the individual farm and the farming of a region give 
valuable information regarding what is being done, the ways 
in which things are being done, and the financial results which 
are being secured. The important questions which are left 
unanswered by these methods of study are: Why is the present 
system profitable or unprofitable and what are the reasons for 
believing that some other type of farming may or may not be 
more profitable? To secure a basis for passing judgment upon 
questions of this character it is necessary to have in mind the 
conditions of agriculture and the demands for agricultural 
products in the entire competing territory of which the local 
region is a part. In order to secure this broad grasp of the 
economic forces which determine what pays best on the in- 
dividual farm and for the nation as a whole, it is desirable to 
make an historical and geographical study of the economic 
forces which have been and which are in operation throughout 
the competing territory. After all other methods have been 
exhausted the experimental method may have to be resorted
-P-A-G-E-420
408 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
to in order to secure some of the results desired. It will be 
worth while to describe some of these methods of study briefly 
in order to illustrate their use. 
Farm accounts. Every farmer should undertake to keep 
some record of his work. If he is not much inclined to figures 
and feels that he does not wish to undertake anything more, 
he should take an inventory once a year. A farm inventory 
is a complete list of all the farm property owned by the farmer, 
a list of his indebtedness, and a list of the bills payable to him. 
All the items in the inventory are valued at the time of the 
inventory. By comparing the value of property at the begin- 
ning of the year with that at the end of the year, the farmer 
knows how much he has gone ahead or fallen behind during the 
year. 
Many a farmer has thought he was doing well because he had 
plenty of ready money, only to find himself hard pressed for 
funds a year later. For a short time the farmer can take in 
money faster by selling cows than by selling milk, but in the 
year’s balance he may have lost heavily by this course. 
The following summary of an inventory and financial state- 
ment will help one to understand the use of this class of records :

The first task in taking an inventory is to list and to give an 
accurate statement of the quantity of goods on hand on the date 
for which the inventory is taken. The quantity of grain in a 
bin, the amount of hay in a mow or in a stack, etc., should be 
ascertained with great care, using the standard measurements. 
The livestock should be itemized one by one by classes as to 
kind and age, all larger tools and machinery should be listed, 
but small tools may be lumped as garden tools, carpenter 
tools, etc. 
Basis of valuation. The valuation of the goods listed on the 
inventory is the next important task. 
Is market price the starting point for valuing each piece of 
‘property listed in the inventory? “At what price shall I 
inventory the oats grown on the farm last year, and at what 
price shall I charge them to the dairy-herd accounts?” The 
answer to this question is not so simple as one might desire. 
The object of the oats account is to know whether to grow oats 
or some other crop requiring attention at the same time of year. 
The object of the dairy-herd accounts is to know whether to be in 
the dairy business or something else. There are at least two 
prices at which the oats may be inventoried. The oats may be 
valued at the local market price minus the cost of hauling them 
to the market, or they may be valued at the local market price 
plus the cost of hauling them from the market. Which of 
these values to place upon the oats, depends upon the circum- 
stances at the farm. If the farmer is an oat producer who  
-P-A-G-E-422
  410 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
sells a part of his oats on the local market and is trying out the 
dairy business on a scale that makes no demand for purchased 
grain, it may be perfectly proper to value the oats at the local 
market price, minus the cost of marketing. This is justified 
on the ground that it gives the farmer the correct basis for 
comparing the relative profitableness of oat production and 
other competing enterprises; on the other hand, if the farmer 
is a dairyman who makes demand for large quantities of grain 
beyond what he is in a position to raise, the oats may properly 
be inventoried at the market price plus the cost of hauling the 
same amount of oats or other grain from the local market. 
This is justified under these conditions on the ground that in 
considering the relative profitableness of growing oats and doing 
something else with a part of his time, this higher valuation is 
the one the farmer must use in determining what it pays him 
best to do. Furthermore, when calculating whether to increase 
or decrease the grain ration fed his herd, or whether to feed oats 
or some other feed, this higher price is the one which should be 
made the basis of the calculation so long as the dairyman is a 
buyer of oats or substitute feeds. Where the dairyman is a 
seller of oats, the problem is different. He then needs to figure 
on the basis of market price minus cost of marketing, in deciding 
how many cows to keep and how generously to feed them. 
Yet another condition may call for still a third basis of valuing 
oats. A farmer may find it profitable to grow oats to feed his 
cows, yet he may not find it profitable to grow oats to sell, nor 
to buy grain to feed the cows. This may be owing to distance 
from the market, or to various other causes. In this case, it may 
be as well to throw the two accounts together and charge the 
cows with the cost of producing the oats. ‘The basis of deter- 
mining whether to grow oats or do something else, then becomes 
a matter of comparing the costs of the different methods of 
getting cow feeds. This is probably an exceptional condition, 
and the question of using cost as a basis of valuation is not 
looked upon favorably, excepting where conditions rule out the 
market factor and put the dairyman on a self-sufficing basis, 
so far as dairy feeds are concerned. The disadvantage of using 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
  
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 411 
costs as a basis of valuation is that it balances the account and 
carries any loss or gain over to the next account, thus blending 
the profits of two or more enterprises, which is contrary to 
the aim of cost accounts, and reduces the system more nearly 
to the basis of simple bookkeeping which shows the profit of 
the business as a whole. 3 
Valuation of ensilage. Ensilage is a feed which rarely enters 
into commerce. ‘True, it is sometimes sold at a sale and farmers 
have sometimes sold ensilage by the load to their neighbors, but 
in general ensilage is made for the exclusive purpose of feeding 
it on the farm. The question then arises, How can market 
prices be brought to bear in placing a value upon the ensilage? 
One method which can be used successfully is to start with the 
price of corn on the local market, subtract the cost of husking 
the corn and hauling it tomarket. The corn value thus obtained 
plus the value of the dry stalks in the field may be the basis of 
valuing the standing corn in the field at the time when it is cut 
for ensilage. To this should be added the cost of harvesting 
the corn and putting it in the silo. The storage costs, including 
interest and depreciation upon the silo and shrinkage, must 
be added in order to have a complete basis of valuing the 
ensilage. This may be called an opportunity cost, but differs 
from actual cost in that it leaves the same amount of profit 
in the corn account as would have been secured by producing 
corn for the market. It also gives a rational basis for charging 
the ensilage to the dairy industry, since the cows must be able 
to pay at least this much for the ensilage in order that the 
farmer can afford to produce ensilage instead of market corn. 
Valuation of hay. The valuation of the hay in the mow 
or in the stack presents a series of problems. Should the farmer 
use cost of production or the market price as the basis of valuing 
the hay? It is a well-recognized fact that if all the farmers in a 
given dairy district should decide to sell their clover hay instead 
of feeding it to cows, they would find the market price dropping 
to a very much lower level than during the time when they were 
feeding most of their hay, some of them selling and some of them 
buying hay. In the district where some hay must be shipped  
-P-A-G-E-424
  412 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
in to maintain the dairy herds, it is obvious that the local market 
price of hay, plus the cost of hauling the hay from the market 
to the farm, is the basis which should be used in calculating 
whether or not it pays to grow hay, also the basis for calculating 
whether or not to increase or decrease the number of cattle kept. 
This then would seem to be the correct basis of valuation of hay 
on hand at the time of taking the inventory. On the other 
hand, if the farmer’s condition is entirely different —if he is 
raising hay for the market and finding it profitable to make 
demand for only a part of the hay in the dairy — he may use 
market price minus the cost of putting the hay on the market 
as a basis of valuation and as a basis of calculating whether to 
grow more hay or keep more cattle. For many farmers cost 
of production may prove a practical basis for valuing clover 
hay. Taking the country as a whole, clover hay is a farm feed 
and has little market except for cattle and sheep feed. It is 
usually produced as an adjunct to the livestock industry and 
yet it is a soil builder as well as a feed for livestock. The other 
crops which grow in rotation with clover benefit greatly by its 
presence in the rotation. The livestock furnish the avenue 
through which to market the hay. For these reasons it would 
seem correct to credit the fields and charge the cows with the 
specific production cost of the clover hay and return the resulting 
fertility to the field without charge to the field or credit to the 
cows. Where this view is accepted, clover hay will be inven- 
toried at cost of production. 
Valuation of livestock. In appraising the dairy herd and 
taking the annual inventory a value should be placed upon 
each animal in the herd. If a cow has been purchased recently 
it is proper to inventory her at the cost price, because this is 
presumably the market price. Ifa cow has been on the farm for 
several years there may be some question regarding the price 
at which she should be inventoried. Obviously the price for 
which she would sell upon the date of the inventory seems to be 
a fair valuation, and if the whole purpose of the inventory were 
to ascertain the worth of all the farmer’s assets, this would be 
the correct basis of valuation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 413 
The inventory may be taken for either or both of two pur- 
poses: To ascertain the farmer’s present worth, or to balance 
his accounts and ascertain the profit of his annual operations. 
Where the object is to ascertain the profits of operation during 
the past year, each animal in the herd should be valued on the 
basis of the previous inventory and marking down or up accord- 
ing to the depreciation or appreciation which has taken place 
during the year. Where the farmer is keeping his herd year 
after year without expectation of using up the cows in the dairy 
business, this would seem to be a satisfactory basis of making 
the inventory. If it is possible, however, to use both bases, 
place two values after each animal, one based upon last year’s 
inventory plus depreciation or appreciation, which will give a 
basis of showing the results of the year’s operation; the other is 
to place a value upon the basis of present market prices. The 
difference between the sums of these two sets of values will show 
the gain or loss during the year due to fluctuation in prices. 
Valuation of machinery. Machinery which has just been 
purchased may be valued at the cost price. The value of a 
machine which has been used for one year should be reduced 
from the cost price by the amount of its normal depreciation. 
To value a machine at the end of the first year at the price at 
which it would sell if put up at auction would hardly seem 
fair to the year’s business, and yet if the farmer could have 
purchased a machine equally good at public auction instead 
of buying the new machine, it would seem reasonable to mark 
the new machine down to the sale price, assuming that the 
farmer had paid the difference for the privilege of breaking in 
the new machine and that this should be charged to his annual 
expense. 
One method of valuing machinery is to deduct a certain 
percentage of the first cost each year. This is a very abstract 
method of inventorying and does not get at the real truth of 
the situation. Each machine should be looked over carefully 
with a view to ascertaining the extent to which it had been worn 
or broken during the year so that any extraordinary deprecia- 
tion may be taken into account. Notice should also be taken if
-P-A-G-E-426
  414 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
expensive repairs have been made during the year which may 
make the machine more valuable than it was at the beginning 
of the year. 
Receipts and expenditures. While the inventory is an indis- 
pensable record, it alone will not tell the whole story. The 
farmer may have made money on the farm and spent it on his 
automobile or other personal accounts, so that his net worth is 
less at the end than at the beginning of the year. In order to 
know what he has madeas a result of his farming operation it is 
necessary (in addition to the annual inventories) to keep a record 
of farm receipts and expenditures. This is not a difficult task 
if each evening when any expenditure has been made or any 
money received or any transaction made where payment is to 
be made in the future, a notation is made in any simple book, 
which may be kept for the purpose; the matters will be ready 
at the close of the year, or any previous time, for comparing the 
farm receipts with farm expenditures and the old inventory wjth 
the new; the farmer may know how much he has made farming 
during the year, for the increase in the inventory plus the in- 
crease of receipts over expenditures equals the farmer’s income, 
which is the return he receives for his investments and his own 
labor and that of his family.

Balance $1143 
At first a balance of $1143 may look very good, but after 
thinking the matter over the farmer says to himself: “I have 
made nothing, I could have sat on the fence and drawn 5 per cent 
on the average investment if I had invested in farm mortgages, 
and that would have amounted to $1690. I have lost $547 by 
   
-P-A-G-E-427
  
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 415 
operating the farm, and I doubt whether the game is worth 
the candle.” 
But at this point his attention is called to the large increase in 
the number and value of the cattle on the farm, and the sugges- 
tion comes that after all he may have made some money farming. 
Before drawing any conclusions from the purchases and sales 
account the inventory should be taken and compared with 
that for the beginning of the year. 
It will be noted that the inventory shows an increase of 
$2145.47 which must be added to the $1143 balance of receipts 
over expenditures. By combining these accounts we have a 
statement showing the gains resulting from the operation of the 
farm as follows:

This $1598.06 represents what the farmer gained by farming, 
but does not show whether he has got ahead or fallen behind 
during the year. The farmer and his family may have spent 
more than they received, both as interest and profits, or they 
may have made a substantial saving. 
To find how much he has got ahead the bills receivable and the 
bills payable must be taken into account along with the inven- 
tory. This may be shown as follows:

Thus, while the indebtedness increased, the property increased 
still more, so that after the family expenses were paid, which

416 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
amounted to $406 more than the interest on the farmer’s net 
worth, the proprietor of Tarpleywick Farm was $1202.47 better 
off at the end than at the beginning of the year. This state- 
ment gives courage for another year and a copy of this summary 
statement put in the hands of the banker will give basis for a 
better line of credit. 
Farm crop accounts. The farmer has many lines of produc- 
tion from which to choose. The problem of choosing the crops 
which will yield maximum results can be solved only by a careful 
study of the conditions which determine the character of farm 
organization. As a rule the farmer does not confine himself 
to one crop but combines a number of crops, for example, corn, 
oats, and hay into one system of crop rotation. The farmer’s 
business problem, so far as crop selection is concerned, is that of 
selecting from each group of competing crops the one which 
will pay best and combining as many non-competing crops as 
can be made to add to the profits of the farm. One who has 
grown the various crops can usually classify them with reason- 
able accuracy into conflicting and non-conflicting groups. 
For example, in southern Wisconsin every farmer knows that 
corn, tobacco, sugar beets, and potatoes conflict with each 
other, but the question of which of these crops will pay the 
farmer best is usually not so clearly in mind. There are those 
who compare profits per acre and forget that one can plant 
and care for three or four times as many acres of one crop as 
of another. 
The most accurate method of comparing profits is to keep cost 
accounts, which will show the amount of labor and other expenses 
laid out on each crop and the returns secured. 
The accompanying summary of results of a cost account will 
help one in understanding the way in which cost accounts aid 
in the selection of crops. 
This table shows the relative profitableness of the crops which 
have been tried on Tarpleywick Farm. In this case the oats paid 
better than the barley, although the income or gross returns per 
acre were nearly the same, the expense in preparing the barley 
land was greater; hence the profits were smaller.

The comparison of the relative profitableness of corn and 
tobacco is not so simple. The tobacco showed a larger profit 
per acre but a smaller return per unit of expenditure than corn. 
The operating expense (aside from rent) being greater, one can- 
not operate so many acres of tobacco, — probably not over 
one third as many acres. For this reason profit per dollar of 
expenditure for labor and equipment seems to be a more practical 
basis for deciding which of two crops to grow than profits per 
acre, although profits per acre multiplied by the number of 
acres one can operate of each crop may in some cases be prefera- 
ble to profit per unit of labor. 
The fact that oats are less profitable than corn should not 
deter the farmer from growing oats if they are more profitable 
than any other crop which requires the farmer’s energy at the 
same time of year. Even if oats are less profitable than corn, 
the corn profits plus the oats profits look much better to the 
farmer than the corn profit alone. 
In order to arrive at all the facts essential to comparing profits 
the cost accountant keeps a record of the hours of human labor, 
horse labor, machine use, seed, fertilizer, twine, etc., put upon 
each acre of landineach crop. Incase of doubt as to the relative 
profitableness of two competing crops, grow some of each until 
the figures show clearly which pays the better. There are 
various systems of keeping cost records, any one of which is 
good. The cost system should be confined to a few comparisons 
at a time, otherwise it becomes too much involved. If the com- 
2E é
-P-A-G-E-430
  418 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
parison is between corn and tobacco, simply charge each of 
these crops for all it gets in the way of labor and supplies just 
as one keeps an account with a neighbor with whom labor is 
exchanged, from whom seed oats are borrowed, and to whom 
some calves were sold on account. Accounts of this kind are 
invaluable because they show which of two more or less profit- 
able crops will add the greater amount to the total profits of the 
farm. It should be kept in mind that in agriculture the purpose 
of cost accounts is not to find out the specific cost of the different 
products but to ascertain the relative profitableness of the 
different types of farming and of the different competing ele- 
ments in each type of farming. Not cost but relative profitable- 
ness is the basis of answering all the economic questions in farm 
management. 
Livestock records and accounts. Every farm record should 
form the basis of answering an important question. On the 
dairy farm the production record is of first importance. Where 
the corn, the oats, and the hay grown on the farm are used in the 
dairy and marketed in the form of milk it is a matter of some 
consequence to know what each cow in the herd is paying for her 
feed. This requires feed records, milk records, and labor 
records. 
Feed records may be kept ina simple manner. For example, 
the farmer has decided that a twelve hundred pound cow should 
be fed thirty-five pounds of ensilage per day, twelve pounds of 
hay per day, and a pound of ground oats (or some other grain 
equivalent) for every four pounds of milk produced. In order 
to feed intelligently the herdsman must have definite figures in 
mind for each cow as he passes down the alley with his feed cart. 
Tf the cow is cleaning up what she is receiving these figures will 
not usually be changed oftener than’ every two weeks and then 
the change is in the grain only. It isa simple matter, therefore, 
to list the cows and the amounts fed each on the first of the 
month and make no further entries until a change is made in 
the ration of one of the cows, which is then entered with the 
date. This gives a satisfactory record of what each cow has 
consumed. -
-P-A-G-E-431
    METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 419 
The right way to keep a milk record is to weigh the product 
each milking and have the milk tested for fat once a month. 
It takes about five seconds to weigh and record the weight of 
the milk where the record sheet and the milk scales are con- 
veniently located. Weighing the product each milking is 
worth while in itself as it is a means of knowing at once if for any 
reason the herd or any particular cow in the herd is not doing 
well. This record is also the basis for adjusting the grain 
ration from time to time. The fat test can be made by the 
farmer but the more practical way is for the farmer to have 
the samples tested at the creamery. 
Labor records show the amount of time spent in the operation 
of the dairy. In addition to keeping general labor records 
which will show the time spent on the dairy herd as a whole, 
it is desirable to take account once a month of the differences 
in the amount of time required by the different cows. For 
example, Mary and Molly give essentially the same amount of 
product, but Molly is easily milked in five minutes whereas ten 
minutes are required to milk Mary. The number of cows one 
man can handle depends largely upon the ease with which they 
can be milked. 
The first object of dairy accounts is to know whether or not 
it pays better to operate the dairy than to sell the crops which 
are fed to the cattle. In answer to this question the records 
should give basis for an annual statement as follows:

Upon balancing his account the farmer often finds as here 
illustrated that he is just about “ breaking even.” The dairy 
is furnishing a market for his crops and his labor. If it were 
not for the dairy, much time which is put on the cows would not 
find profitable employment. The dairy provides employment 
the year round with emphasis on the winter months, while 
the growing of hay, oats, and corn give summer employment 
mainly. Furthermore, the farmer may find that, while he can 
produce good ensilage, the corn is caught by the frost three years 
out of five and that the attempt to produce merchantable corn 
is a precarious undertaking. 
Everything considered the farmer decides that in spite of the 
showing on the balance sheet he can do no better than to continue 
to produce milk. But if he is thoughtful he will ask himself the 
question, How can I increase my production of milk without a 
proportional increase in cost? By looking over the herd record 
he finds that his best cow, Bedelia, gave 13,500 pounds of milk 
testing 3.8 per cent butterfat, whereas the poorest cow, Lily, 
gave only 4860 pounds of milk testing 4.2 per cent. The milk 
from Bedelia was worth $1.675 per hundred or $226.125; that 
from Lily was worth $1.725 per hundred or $83.835. The total 
charge against Bedelia was $168.70 and that against Lily was 
$131.20. The profit on Bedelia was $57.42, while the loss on 
Lily was $47.37. A further study showed the farmer that if he 
could dispose of the poorest five cows in the herd and replace 
them with cows as good as the average of the other five, his net 
profits on the herd would be $260. The leading purpose of 
milk and feed records is to eliminate the “ boarders ” and fill 
the barn with high producers. 
The cost-accounting method is suited especially to testing the 
competing elements in a given type of farming. The general 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
    METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 421 
financial account including receipts, expenditures, and inventories 
shows the profits of a given type of farming under a given 
manager. For example, if in one region where the conditions 
are the same it is found that the farmers who are selling cream 
and some dairy cows, and hogs about equal in value to the total 
dairy receipts, are through a series of years making more money 
than those who buy cows, sell whole milk from a larger herd 
but keep no hogs, it would seem to indicate that the former were 
the more profitable type of farming. It rarely happens that 
all the farmers of a district keep accounts which give basis for 
such a comparison. In the absence of financial accounts the 
“ Farm Survey ” is a very useful method of finding a basis for 
making up a statement of the profits derived from operating a 
farm. 
The farm survey is an attempt to get the farmer to call to 
mind what he had on hand in the way of farm property of all 
kinds at the beginning of the year, the receipts and expenses 
during the year and the property on hand at the close of the 
year, in order that an annual statement may be made showing the 
profits of operation. While these surveys lack much of complete 
accuracy, they give basis for making comparisons which give 
important suggestions regarding the relative profitableness of 
types of farming. The farm survey has been most useful in 
stimulating bookkeeping on the part of farmers. It is a method 
of permanent value, improving with the increase in bookkeeping 
by farmers. Its future use probably lies in the field of statistics 
rather than in the field of accounting. 
The historical method. Much is gained by studying the 
operations of economic forces through a period of time. Eco- 
nomic forces are not easily measured, and they are so numerous, 
of such varying strength, and so often operate in opposite direc- 
tions that at any given moment it is difficult to make an estimate 
of the future resultant of these forces, unless the changes 
wrought by them in the past can be resorted to as a basis of 
judgment. : 
The federal census for 1900 showed that more than a third of 
the farmers of the United States were tenants and about a third
-P-A-G-E-434
422 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
of the farms operated by owners were mortgaged. Without re- 
sorting to the historical method it would have been impossible 
to know whether the forces making for tenancy were overbalanc- 
ing the forces making for ownership, or vice versa. It might 
be inferred by one viewing these facts without this historical 
setting that ownership had once been universal and that the 
owners had lost money, mortgaged their farms, lost their titles 
to the land, and become tenant farmers. On the other hand, one 
might infer that farmers were using tenancy and the mortgage 
as means of making transition from landless laborers to the 
free ownership of land. This illustration is to the point because 
inferences were drawn in 1880 when statistics of land tenure 
were collected for the first time. 
At the present time, with the changes of thirty years recorded 
at ten-year intervals, it is possible to demonstrate clearly the 
trend of affairs during that period, and to describe many of the 
forces which have been operating. The available materials show 
that young men do very generally rise through the successive 
stages of tenant farmers and mortgaged owners to the free own- 
ership of farms, but the data show also that there has been a 
retardation in this movement and that longer time is required 
to make this movement recently than in earlier years. The 
census data for 1890 and for 1900 show that older farmers are 
generally owners, while tenancy is most common among young 
farmers. By comparing the data for the two periods, it be- 
comes clear that some force is retarding the movement from 
tenancy to ownership, for a smaller percentage of those of the 
various ages were owners, and a larger percentage were tenants 
in 1900 than in 1890. This is illustrated in Figure 17. Illinois 
is used for this illustration because tenancy is more common 
in that state than in any other part of the North. The illus- 
tration shows that the percentage of owners among young farm- 
ers is very small, but that ownership increases with the age 
of a farmer and that, of the farmers fifty-five years of age and 
over, about 85 per cent are owners. By comparing the situation 
in 1890 and 1900 for each age group, it becomes clear that while 
there is a movement toward land ownership, as the farmers 
 
-P-A-G-E-435
    METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 423 
grow older, it is true, however, that a smaller proportion of the 
farmers of each age group were owners in 1900 than in 1890, 
showing retardation in the movement from tenancy to free 
ownership. The right hand illustration in Figure 17 shows the 
reverse situation with regard to tenancy, that tenancy is most 
common in the younger age groups and gradually declines. 
A careful study of the facts now available shows that many 
forces are in operation, some making for dependent tenants 
others for independent landowning farmers. 
Another example of the historical study of economic forces is 
afforded by the sheep industry in the United States. Between 
1840 and 1850 there was a decline in the number of sheep kept in 
parts of Vermont and in the eastern part of New York, but the 
marked change was in Ohio and Michigan, where there was a 
great increase. The tendencies were the same in Vermont, 
New York, Ohio, and Michigan, between 1850 and 1860, withan 
important beginning of the sheep industry in Texas, California, 
and Oregon. 
The decade from 1860 to 1870 brought a reaction in north- 
eastern Ohio and the beginnings of the concentration of the 
sheep industry of Texas in the dry lands of the South. Both 
of these movements continued during the next decade. By 
1880, Vermont had almost ceased to be a sheep state, and the 
sheep of New York were but a handful in comparison to the 
number in 1840, but the beginnings of the new industry in the 
Rocky Mountain states were already important in Colorado, 
Wyoming, and Montana. During the next two decades the 
development of the sheep industry in the mountain states con- 
tinued, but between 1890 and 1900 a marked decline is shown in 
California, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio. 
When the maps for 1840 and 1910 are compared, it becomes 
evident that during the seventy years the sheep industry made a 
complete shift with the exception of a few counties in Pennsyl- 
vania and Ohio, so far as the concentrated centers of production 
areconcerned. By reading the agricultural papers of this period 
one finds many references to these changes. A well-known 
Merino breeder of Vermont in one decade is heard from in the
-P-A-G-E-436
424 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  next decade from California where he is in the same business. 
The method of driving sheep from Ohio to Texas is described 
and in fact the student who has the time and ability can easily 
reconstruct the whole movement of the sheep industry, from the 
days when Vermont and New York led in this industry to the 
present day with the Rocky Mountain states in the dominant 
position. 
The story is only half told, however, until it is explained. To 
explain these changes it becomes necessary to write the history 
of the expansion of American agriculture. The competition of 
the various farm enterprises has played an important part. The 
result of this competition is determined by geographic factors. 
Topography, climate, and nearness to the market are important 
examples. 
In Vermont, New York, northeastern Ohio, and in Wis- 
consin, wool growing was driven out by the dairy industry. 
This is indicated by contemporaneous literature. Statistics of 
the dairy industry were not collected in 1840, but the milk 
production statistics as shown by the census for 1910 indicate the 
presence of this industry at the latter date in the regions which 
were in the earlier decades important centers of the sheep in- 
dustry. The economic principle involved is simple. Wool 
is durable, dairy products are perishable. The value of wool 
per pound is much greater than milk and has often been greater 
than butter and cheese. The dairyman at a distance from 
the market for dairy products cannot compete with the one near 
the market so well as the shepherd in the distant hills and downs 
can compete with the wool grower near the center of population. 
Beef cattle replaced sheep in Texas, the development of agri- 
culture and fruit growing by irrigation was an important factor 
in California, and tariff legislation played an important part in 
forcing out the sheep in Ohio and Michigan during the nineties. 
A careful study of the operation of competitive forces, with and 
without artificial price levels, enables the student to discover the 
workings of the economic laws which have wrought the changes. 
The geographical method. Farming in the various regions of 
the United States shows a high degree of diversity. In one region
-P-A-G-E-437
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 425 
corn, oats, hay, pasture, dairy cows, and hogs, constitute the 
principal enterprises combined upon the individual farm. In an- 
other region the combination is the same with the exception that 
more emphasis is given to corn and hogs, and beef cattle replace 
the dairy cows. In other regions the livestock is unimportant 
and special crops as wheat, cotton, or cane, stand out as the 
dominant enterprise, while in still other regions, the grazing of 
cattle or sheep becomes the principal enterprise. 
These variations in farm organization are due to differences 
in soil, climate, labor supply, market relations, etc. The expla- 
nation of differences in types of farming, so far as they are due 
to differences in environment, is the purpose of the geographical 
method. 
The geographical method may be illustrated by comparing 
the distribution of spring wheat, barley, and oats. These crops 
are usually counted competing crops. They occupy the same 
place in the system of crop rotation and they would require the 
attention of the farmer about the same time of year in any given 
region. A study of their distribution shows a remarkably 
distinct division of territory between these crops. In Minne- 
sota, for example, wheat growing extends east to a line drawn 
north and south through Northfield. East of this line barley is 
the dominant spring grain crop. In Wisconsin, barley produc- 
tion is concentrated in the east central counties noted for their 
high-grade barley for brewing purposes. 
The centers where oat production is concentrated are found 
farther south. Central Illinois and north-central Iowa stand out 
as regions where oat production holds a highly important place 
on the farm. 
That climate is one factor in determining this division of 
territory is obvious from the nature of the division. These crops 
differ in their demands for moisture as well as in their require- 
ments with regard to temperature. Soil differences are said to 
play an important part in this division of territory. The rela- 
tion of the barley regions to barley markets is in itself suggestive 
of another geographic factor which should be considered. 
This study might be carried further by the use of charts of    
-P-A-G-E-438
  426 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
the various other enterprises which are complementary or sup- 
plementary to the group of competing crops. Such maps would 
show the spring wheat region to be a flax region and the oat 
regions to be corn regions, etc. This method followed out com- 
pletely with maps of livestock, as well as crops, would show the 
type of farming in any agricultural region. 
The maps showing the type of farming should be accompanied 
with maps showing the topography, the soil, the length of the 
growing season, the temperature during the growing season, the 
rainfall, the market, the agricultural population, the manufac- 
turing population, the mining population, etc., all of which help to 
explain the types of farming in terms of geographical differences. 
The statistical method. The statistical method stands for 
quantitative study. Much of our knowledge of economic 
forces corresponds to qualitative analysis in chemistry. The 
force is noted but not measured. The statistical and ac- 
counting methods look to the measurement of forces, thus 
putting the work on a quantitative basis. In the treatment of 
every subject and in the use of all other methods, all data which 
lend themselves to counts or measurements should be treated 
statistically. 
There are specialists who devote themselves to the collection 
and the tabulation of statistics. Their finished product is raw 
material for the agricultural economist. 
Sources of statistical data, There is no one greater source 
of material for the student of agricultural economics than the 
reports of the federal census. They contain the only comprehen- 
sive source of material from which it is possible to ascertain 
the type of farming in every section of the United States. This 
gives the basis for the study of comparative agriculture, which is 
one of the best methods of gaining knowledge of the economic 
forces which determine the actions of farmers. 
Not only the type of farming, but also the economic status of 
the farmer is shown by the census for every county in the United 
States. Both the white and the colored farmers are divided into 
seven classes, based upon the relation they sustain to the land 
they cultivate.
-P-A-G-E-439
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 427 
The census reports give the data on which to base historical 
studies of the changes which are taking place in the type of 
farming and in the status of the farmer, as well as a basis for 
comparative study at a given time. 
The first agricultural census was taken in 1840. This first 
census of agriculture was a crop and livestock census. In 1850, 
general farm data were added and other improvements have been 
added each decade since. 
In 1880, tenure statistics were added. Thus the basis for 
studying changes in the type of farming extends over a period 
of seventy years and the data for studying changes in the status 
of the farmer are available for thirty years. 
Too little use has been made of these valuable materials in the 
past. Two methods which the writer has found useful in the 
utilization of these statistics may be mentioned: 
The system of mapping already illustrated providing a chart 
with close gradation of variation in density for each fact pre- 
sented in the census, puts the materials in form for ready com- 
parisons both historical and geographical. Not only does the 
series of maps show the changes in the localization of each line of 
production through a series of years, and show how the territory 
is divided between the various lines of production at a given 
time, but indicates also the way in which the different lines of 
production are combined in a given district, thus showing the 
type of farming in each district. 
The tabular method can also be used to advantage in compar- 
ing types of farming. A table indicating the proportion of the 
improved land in farms devoted to each crop shows the ultiliza- 
tion of the land. The character of the crops, and the relation 
between the numbers of livestock kept and the amount of feed- 
able products produced gives a clue to the way in which the 
products are utilized, whether sold in their original form asa 
product of the field, or used as a basis of the livestock industry. 
While a series of maps based upon quantities of product can be 
made to cover the seventy years, maps showing crop acreage, 
which is a better basis for determining the utilization of the 
land, cannot be made for the decennials prior to 1880.
-P-A-G-E-440
  428 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
In making use of the census materials, the original statistics 
by counties are of first importance. The descriptive material 
which describes the quality of the statistics is next in impor- 
tance. The text which is intended to supplement the statistics, 
while useful, is of less permanent importance then the detailed 
statistics. 
State census reports, the annual reports, and more recently, 
the Year Books of the United States Department of Agriculture, | 
and the state agricultural reports contain valuable statistics. 
Market reports in trade papers and in reports of boards of trade, 
etc., provide statistics of use in the study of prices. While 
these various sources are not all that may be desired, the student 
will find that anything he can do for himself in the collection and 
tabulation of statistics will be but a drop in the bucket in com- 
parison with the data available in these sources which have 
been prepared by the statistician. Since he is so dependent 
upon these sources of material, it isimportant that the agricul- 
tural economist be in close touch with the agricultural statistician 
who is preparing these source books. 
The use of market statistics may be illustrated by a study of 
the relation of the price of corn to the supply and price of hogs. 
The causes of the high prices of hogs on the Chicago market 
in rgr1o can best be understood by studying the history of the 
hog and corn industries as shown by the market statistics. 
When the statistics of prices are studied it is an undeniable fact 
that hog prices were higher in 1910 than they had been at any 
other time for a long series of years, as shown in Figure 23. 
The general theory being accepted that this rise in price must 
be due to some change in the conditions of supply or the condi- 
tions of demand, the student should proceed to study the con- 
ditions of supply and demand. By charting the supply of hogs 
on the Chicago market month by month, the fact becomes clear 
that during the years 1909 and 1910 the supply of hogs was un- 
usually short. The price of hogs was unusually high during 
the same period. Little time is required to make the inference. 
But what was the cause of the shortage of hogs? One may pro- 
ceed to formulate hypotheses which may be put into the form
-P-A-G-E-441
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 429 
of questions. Has some pestilence ravaged the hog lots of the 
country? Has there been a failure of the crops which are used 
as hog feed? Corn being the principal hog feed, we may ask,

at Chicago. 
The price curves are so drawn that when one bushel of corn produces 10 pounds 
of pork, the amount which the hog price curve rises above the corn price curve 
represents the net returns from the extra labor of breeding and feeding. In 1906 
and 1907 there was a large profit in feeding corn to hogs, while in 1908 there was 
a loss. The figures on the margin represent the monthly high price of corn in 
cents per bushel; the monthly high price of hogs in tenths of cents per pound and 
the monthly receipts of hogs in tens of thousands. 
great? These conjectures as to the cause of the scarcity of hogs 
leads to the charting of the Chicago price of corn. 
During the years 1906 and 1907 the price of hogs was very 
high in proportion to the price of corn. The supply of hogs 
was relatively short during the early part of the period, but by 
the beginning of 1908 the supply of hogs on the Chicago market
-P-A-G-E-442
  430 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
reached an unusually high mark. During the year 1908 the 
corn price curve held steadily and appreciably above the hog 
pricecurve. On the assumption that a bushel of corn is required 
to produce ten pounds of pork, this meant a loss on the corn as 
well as on the time employed in feeding ; ten to one is the price 
relation in the chart. The distance which the curve showing 
hog prices rises above the curve showing corn prices shows the 
return for labor in feeding. In 1908 this was a minus quantity. 
This condition had not existed during the prior fifteen years. 
Early in 1909 the curves were close together, but the corn price 
was downward, while the hog price was unusually high. Early 
in rgto hog prices started down. ; 
So soon as the situation as to the price of corn and hogs and 
the supply of hogs after 1907 is impressed upon the mind, it is 
hard to keep from making the inference that because hogs were 
fed at a loss in 1908 many farmers ceased to breed hogs in the 
usual numbers. The facts indicate that whether it was lack of 
breeding or some other cause the supply of hogs in the country 
was short, for so high a price for so many months would certainly 
stimulate shipments if marketable hogs were to be found. 
The next fact requiring explanation is the high price of corn 
in 1908. A glance at the curves shows that during the greater 
part of the year the hog price was quite normal, but the corn 
price was abnormally high. 
The receipts of corn on the Chicago market in 1908 were 
34,000,000 bushels below that of the previous year, and the 
lowest they had been since 1895, with the exception of the years 
1gor and 1902 when the receipts were low and the price high 
owing to the short corn crop of 1901. But why this shortage 
in receipts of corn on the Chicago market in 1908? 
The corn crop of 1907 was less than it had been for the two 
preceding years, but with the exception of 1905 and 1906 the 
crop of 1907 was the largest reported. The shortage of the corn 
crop of 1907 under that of 1906 was only 11.5 per cent, but 
the receipts of hogs at Chicago during the period when the 
bulk of the hogs which had been fed 1907 corn were marketed, 
indicate that out of this relatively small corn crop of 1907 an

unusually large number of hogs were fed, leaving a relatively 
short supply for the market. Before drawing conclusions, how- 
ever, other factors need be carefully investigated to make sure 
that other important forces were not operating simultaneously. 
These facts are presented in this form in order to illustrate this

FicurE 24.—In the winter of 1916 and 1917 many dairy farmers were im- 
pressed with the idea that it would pay well to buy feed in the summer 
and store it for use in the winter. A study of this chart should make one 
better able to judge whether the conditions of the feed market in 1916 
and 1917 were normal or exceptional. This is given to illustrate the way 
in which statistical study may be used in giving a broader basis for pass- 
ing judgment on a question of this kind. 
well-known method of putting statistical data in such form that 
their relations are easily comprehended. 
The experimental method. The experimental method may 
be used to throw light upon many problems in agricultural 
economics. For example, in order to carry on investigations in 
intensity of culture, this method must be employed. Some of 
the data essential to the analysis of the economic problems of the 
farm can be secured by keeping records upon farms under the 
management of intelligent farmers with whom it is possible to
-P-A-G-E-444
432 AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 
  codperate. By this method, the problem of combining comple- 
mentary enterprises in such a manner as will keep the labor and 
equipment employed as nearly continuously as possible and in 
the lines of production which will prove most profitable, can be 
worked out in a manner fairly satisfactory. Furthermore, the 
contact with the farm under conditions of normal commercial 
agriculture gives validity to the results secured and gives the 
opportunity for developing a system of records which may ulti- 
mately be used by an intelligent farmer in determining what to 
produce. 
When one turns from the question of what to produce to the 
question of how it should be produced, the problem becomes one 
which requires controlled experiments. The major economic 
problem relating to the question of how to produce the articles 
decided upon, centers in the question of the proportions in which 
the factors of production shall be utilized, the best-known phase 
of which is the problem of intensity of culture. This is a ques- 
tion regarding which agriculturists, economists, and farmers have 
theorized for centuries, but regarding which no adequate ex- 
periments have been carried out. In the theoretical analysis of 
this problem, the point has been reached where experiments are 
essential to further progress. 
The proper degree of intensity of culture must be determined 
for each farm, and the result will change with variation in the 
wages of labor, the cost of equipment, and the price of land. 
The first step toward progress in this line is the discovery of a 
method of experimentation which can be applied upon any farm 
without state aid and without endangering the profits of the 
farmer. 
Experiments with a series of plots with varying treatment are 
valuable for ascertaining physical and biological truths, but it 
is doubtful if they are of use in the field of economics for the 
simple reason that while the laws of economics which determine 
the proper degree of intensity of culture are of general applica- 
tion, the conditions are so variable that the proper degree of in- 
tensity on one farm is not necessarily the proper degree on 
another. Plot experiments on the intensity of culture would
-P-A-G-E-445
  METHODS OF STUDYING AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS 433 
have no practical value therefore except for the farm on which 
they were made. Plot experiments are too expensive for the 
practical farmer, hence some other method must be contrived. 
It is highly desirable that a method of ascertaining the proper 
degree of intensity of culture be discovered and taught, but any 
attempt at teaching more than the principles involved and the 
methods of their application is folly, for what is right for one 
member of a class of one hundred students, or one out of an 
audience of farmers, may be the wrong thing for many of the 
others. 
Differences in the soil, in the value of the land, in the efficiency 
of the farmers, and in facilities for marketing make differing 
degrees of intensity of culture necessary. Any method of 
ascertaining the most profitable degree of intensity on any farm, 
to be of general use, must be so planned that its application will 
not endanger the profits of the farm. Some process of gradual 
adjustments suggests itself as most likely to succeed. 
The foregoing discussion is not intended as a complete survey 
of methods applicable to the study of economic problems in 
agriculture. The aim has been simply to describe the methods 
in common use at the present time. No one method is fa- 
vored above another. All are needed in securing an intensive 
and a comprehensive view of the economic forces which affect 
the farmer.

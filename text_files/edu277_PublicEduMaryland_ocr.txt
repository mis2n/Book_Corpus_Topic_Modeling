PREFACE 
The Act of 1914, Chapter 844, which created our com- 
mission, contains the following statement of the purposes 
of the legislature: 
“Tt is the desire of the General Assembly that there be 
made a comprehensive study of the public school system 
of the State of Maryland, of the state-aided elementary 
and secondary schools and the higher educational insti- 
tions of the State of Maryland, with a view to correlating 
and coérdinating the different institutions wholly or 
partially supported by state appropriations.” 
The Act also set forth in its premises: 
“That the Commission shall have the power to 
call to its assistance any expert help that may be avail- 
able either from public or private foundations.” 
An appropriation of $5,000 was made to carry out the 
purposes of the Legislature. As this was clearly insuf- 
ficient to conduct so extensive a survey as that con- 
templated by the Act, it became evident that the 
Legislature intended that the commission should secure 
the services of one of the great foundations now conduct- 
ing educational surveys throughout the states. After 
careful consideration the commission requested the 
General Education Board to undertake the survey. The 
vii 
2tO08
-P-A-G-E-8
viii PREFACE 
Board consented to do so, generously agreeing at the same 
time to supplement the legislative appropriation to the 
extent of $7,500 or such part thereof as might be needed. 
The commission stated to the representatives of the 
General Education Board that it was the commission’s 
opinion that the State of Maryland could not afford at 
the present time to increase its appropriations for public 
schools. The commission therefore asked the General 
Education Board not to draw a plan for an ideal school 
system in Maryland which would be beyond the state’s 
resources, but rather to indicate whether or not the 
State of Maryland was getting the best results from the 
money now expended, and if not, in what manner the 
same sum could be expended to better advantage. 
It should be a source of gratification to the people of 
the state that the representatives of the Board have re- 
ported that the present appropriation, if properly sup- 
plemented by the counties, and wisely and correctly 
applied, should give Maryland an excellent public school 
system. 
The report which is now presented embodies a survey 
of the elementary and secondary schools of the counties. 
It does not deal with the schools of Baltimore City. Nor 
does it cover the higher educational institutions receiving 
state aid. It is the purpose of the commission, if con- 
tinued in office by the Legislature, to conduct a survey 
of these institutions. A study of education in this state 
would not be complete without such a survey. The 
Act of 1914 wisely contemplated ‘‘correlating and co-
-P-A-G-E-9
PREFACE ix 
ordinating the different institutions wholly or partially 
supported by state appropriations.” 
The evident object is to provide a plan whereunder a 
student will be able to pass from the lowest grade of pub- 
lic school, to and through the highest that state-aided 
institutions offer, with the least possible delay and at the 
least possible cost to the state. The object has our en- 
tire approval. 
The State of Maryland expends $269,000 per annum 
for the aid of higher educational institutions, besides 
making large additional appropriations for the erection 
of new buildings. The people of the state are entitled to 
know whether this money is wisely and efficiently ex- 
pended and if the state is receiving an adequate return. 
As the original agreement between the commission 
and the General Education Board covered the survey of 
the higher institutions as well as the lower schools, the 
new survey should be conducted without further cost to 
the state except for an appropriation of $1,000 for the 
actual expenses of the commission, such as printing, 
clerical work, travelling expenses, etc. 
In view of the fact that a thorough survey of this char- 
acter will furnish the only correct basis on which a sound 
judgment as to the future can be based, the commission 
respectfully suggests that it may be detrimental to the 
best interest of the state to cripple any educational insti- 
tution that has any possibility of being moulded into 
such a plan by failure to make the usual appropriation 
for such institution at the present session. It also feels
-P-A-G-E-10
x PREFACE 
in duty bound to urge upon the Legislature that no 
appropriation for educational institutions of any char- 
acter be increased until the Legislature has before it for 
guidance all of the fundamental facts, supplemented by 
studies of the experiences of other states in the various 
fields of education, and aided by the unbiased opinion 
of experts based upon these facts and studies. No mat- 
ter how pressing the present need of any institution may 
appear to be, an increased appropriation may prove to 
be not only a waste of state funds, but an actual impedi- 
ment in the formation of the plan of codrdination con- 
templated by the Act of 1914. 
The present report of the General Education Board 
has the unqualified endorsement of the commission. It 
is the work of Mr. Abraham Flexner and Dr. Frank P. 
Bachman, assisted in special lines by Mr. Jackson Davis 
and Mr. W. W. Theisen. Mr. Flexner, now one of the 
secretaries of the General Education Board, was formerly 
connected with the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching; he is the author of The American 
College, Medical Education in the United States and 
Canada, Medical Education in Europe, and numerous 
papers dealing with educational subjects. Dr. Bachman 
has served as Assistant Superintendent of the schools of 
Cleveland, and was a member of the staff of experts, who, 
headed by Professor Hanus, conducted the survey of the 
schools of New York City. He has also taken an im- 
portant part in similar investigations elsewhere. He 
has published books entitled, ‘Problems in Elementary
-P-A-G-E-11
  PREFACE xi 
School Administration” and ‘‘Principles of Elementary 
Education”; his contributions to the New York school 
survey deal with the elementary schools and the school 
budget. Mr. Davis, formerly State Supervisor of Negro 
Rural Schools of Virginia, is now the Field Agent of the 
General Education Board in charge of its work in Negro 
Education. Mr. Theisen is an experienced teacher, now 
working in the field of educational statistics. Dr. Bach- 
man was in local charge of the Maryland Survey and 
himself visited every county in the state. 
In the course of the survey Dr. Bachman visited over 
16 per cent. of the white teachers and 1o per cent. of 
the colored teachers of the state. Schools were visited 
at random, and for this reason those visited were prob- 
ably typical of existing conditions. Dr. Bachman had 
the full codperation of the State Board of Education, of 
the State Superintendent of Education, and of the school 
authorities throughout the state. 
The Federal Census of 1910 ranks Maryland among 
the states of the Union as twenty-third in point of 
illiteracy. If full allowance is made for the 20 per cent. 
Negro population of the state, the results are still very 
discouraging. 
It is a source of congratulation that the remedy is 
demonstrably clear and comparatively simple. The 
needed corrections in the school machinery are pointed 
out in the report. These can be promptly made. The 
necessary legislation to this end is embraced in proposed 
bills which will be presented to the Legislature.
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii PREFACE 
But no legislation will produce results unless our schools 
are divorced from politics. Public opinion in the United 
States has long since endorsed the view that education 
and politics will not mix. The welfare of over two 
hundred thousand school children in the counties of 
Maryland is at stake, as well as the happiness and pros- 
perity of generations to come. Proper education is 
fundamental to good citizenship, to the progress of com- 
munities, and to the state as a whole. The problem of 
educating our children strikes deep into the very roots of 
state welfare and penetrates into nearly every home. 
Good schools cannot be made or sustained upon any 
other basis than intelligence and common sense. Polit- 
ical conditions and questions vary in the counties; the 
needs of the schools are almost identical. They should 
have no relation whatsoever to the political problems of 
a county. 
We venture to say that this is the view of all right- 
thinking politicians. We do not believe that it is their 
aim or desire to mix politics with education. It so hap- 
pens, however, that our school laws recognize the ex- 
istence of political parties and have been framed to 
invite political activity. 
The opportunity has come to remodel our public 
school laws. We have the facts before us together 
with the best expert advice. If this advice is followed, 
the State of Maryland should very soon be able to wipe 
out the blot of illiteracy and greatly to improve the type 
of education provided for the children of the state.

In other states the problem of reorganizing an educa- 
tional system is very complex and very difficult. It is 
comparatively simple in our state. The commission 
respectfully submits herewith to the Legislature copies 
of proposed bills drafted in line with its recommendations. 
We most earnestly urge their passage by the Legislature 
of 1916.

INTRODUCTION 
In the following pages an effort is made to describe the 
organization of public education in Maryland, to estimate 
its efficiency, and to suggest such changes as appear at 
once desirable and feasible. 
The people of Maryland will find some grounds for 
gratification as they read this volume. Public education 
in Maryland is on the whole soundly organized; at the 
head stands the State Board of Education, acting through 
the State Superintendent upon the local unit, which is— 
as it should be—the county, not the district or the town- 
ship as is the case in less well-organized states. American 
experience stamps this type of state educational organi- 
zation as the best that can be devised, for it allows at 
one and the same time for local initiative and for central 
direction, both of which are indispensable. Further, the 
state deals generously with its public schools in the mat- 
ter of money. Some of the counties, as we shall learn, 
do less than their duty in this matter, but the state has 
been liberal—too liberal, indeed, with such counties as 
have failed to help themselves. We do not propose, 
therefore, any fundamental changes in the general struc- 
ture of the public school system of Maryland nor do we 
suggest that the state increase at all its appropriations 
to the schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
So far the people of Maryland have, as we have said, 
reason to be satisfied. But there are other aspects which 
will cause grave concern. A system of public education, 
in the main soundly conceived, yields on the whole ex- 
tremely unsatisfactory results. A few counties possess 
good and steadily improving schools; a good school may 
be found here and there in other counties. But the large 
majority of the schools are poor; teachers are, for the most 
part, poorly trained; instruction is ineffective and ob- 
solete; children attend school with disastrous irregularity ; 
school buildings are far too often in unsatisfactory condi- 
tion, school grounds frequently neglected and untidy. 
How can a fundamentally sound system produce such 
results? 
There are, indeed, a good many reasons. The state 
possesses a sound organization in skeleton or outline only. 
Neither the State Department of Education nor the office 
of the County Superintendent is so manned and equipped 
that they are really effective for the purposes for which 
they exist. The State Superintendent is charged with 
many important duties, but he has only a single assistant 
to help him in discharging them. The County Superin- 
tendency is in even more unsatisfactory condition. In 
the first place, the law does not even require the County 
Superintendent to be a trained or experienced school man; 
in the second place, adequate provision for skilled as- 
sistance exists in only one or two counties. In most 
counties, therefore, an untrained official without expert 
aid certificates teachers, arranges courses of study, super-  
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTION xvii 
vises instruction, and examines for promotion pupils 
who attend school regularly or not, as they or their parents 
please. 
Finally, the state’s large school fund is not distributed 
so as to accomplish the greatest possible good. For it 
is distributed almost unconditionally. The counties 
get their quota whether they do their educational duty 
or not, with the result that the backward counties some- 
times do much less than they ought and some well-to-do 
counties do much less than they should. The state fund 
thus becomes a source of positive demoralization. It 
can be converted into a real help and stimulus only if 
payment by the state is conditioned upon the perform- 
ance of local duty. 
In view of these conditions it is easy enough to under- 
stand why a fundamentally correct type of organization 
produces unsatisfactory educational results in Mary- 
land. But, as a matter of fact, the state does not even 
fare as well with its present organization as it might: 
why not? 
A few words suffice to explain. Public education in 
Maryland is “‘in politics.” Politics are apt to prevent 
the State Board from acting with vigor; to determine 
the composition of the county boards; to affect the 
choice of the county superintendents; even to enter 
into the selection of the one-room rural school teacher. 
Of course, there are exceptions. Some of the county 
boards are excellent; some schools are entirely free from 
political taint. But, in general, political and personal
-P-A-G-E-18
  xviii INTRODUCTION 
considerations impair the vigor, independence, thorough- 
ness, and efficiency of the school system. The public 
does not begin to realize the seriousness of the political 
infection or the damage it does. 
The following chapters discuss in detail the situation 
which has thus been briefly summarized. It is hoped 
that legislation supplementing and improving the present 
state system may result. But even should this be the 
case, public education will continue to disappoint, unless 
higher ideals result in completely divorcing education 
from politics.

  Public Education in Maryland 
I. MARYLAND AND ITS SCHOOLS 
Be undertaking to describe or to discuss 
education in Maryland it is necessary to know the 
state itself. The very fact that we nowadays 
begin with an inquiry of this kind is significant. It means 
that there is no single educational pattern that ought to 
be applied to every state or to every county in any state 
regardless of local conditions. Not only the substance 
but the end of education must be defined with reference 
to the needs and opportunities of the people who are to 
be educated. 
Maryland is a border state, lying midway between 
North and South; in population and occupations it 
is therefore partly Northern and partly Southern. It 
differs, however, from all other states of the Union in the 
extent of its water area, for of a total area of 12,210 
square miles, almost one-fifth (2,319 square miles) is 
water. Of the estimated state population, 1,300,000, 
43 per cent., live in the city of Baltimore; a dozen small 
cities raise the urban population to just about so per cent. 
From the standpoint of numbers, therefore, the state is 
half urban and half rural. If, however, the city of Balti- 
3
-P-A-G-E-22
  
4 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
more is ignored, an overwhelming percentage of the rest 
of the population live in the country. Maryland is, 
therefore, with the exception of its one great city, a rural 
state with an unusual water development. Its rural 
character is clearer from the educational than from 
any other point of view; for of 388,486 children of 
legal school age in the state, 234,900 live outside 
Baltimore City. For education this is a fact of prime 
importance. 
The Federal Census of 1910 shows that more than five 
hundred occupations are carried on in Maryland. Of 
these a few are regional—mining, for example, in the 
mountain regions, fishing and oystering about the 
Chesapeake. Baltimore thrives on manufacturing, trade, 
and transportation. Outside of Baltimore, agriculture 
predominates. Indeed, one-third of all the wage-earners 
outside that city and 21 per cent. of those in the 
entire state are engaged in one branch of farming or 
another. 
Agriculture has prospered in Maryland, though less se 
than in some other parts of the country. In the last 
decade the number of farms has increased by something 
over 6 per cent.; the value of farm property has increased 
by 40 per cent.; farms now average slightly over 100 
acres as opposed to twice that size in 1850. Simultane- 
ously with the decrease in the size of the farms, the num- 
ber of owners has increased. The tenant farmer, so 
apt to be an unfavorable symptom, is not prominent and 
is disappearing. The significance of these facts for our 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  
MARYLAND AND ITS SCHOOLS 5 
inquiry is obvious. . As the city of Baltimore is not in- 
cluded in this study, we are called on to deal with a sys- 
tem of schools serving mainly a rural population. 
The population of Maryland grows steadily, but no 
longer rapidly. The state ranked sixth with 320,000 
inhabitants in 1790; it ranks twenty-seventh with over 
four times that number to-day. Its population is un- 
usually stable. In 1910 about 80 per cent. of those 
living in the state were born there, while only 8 per cent. 
were foreign born. In the rural districts this condition 
is even more marked; there the percentages were 84 
per cent. born and living in the state; 3.7 per cent. foreign 
born. The border-line situation of the state adds, how- 
ever, a complication; for approximately one-fifth of the 
population belongs to the Negro race. The schools of 
Maryland serve then in the main native races, living 
largely in the country, the Negro race being numerous 
enough to make a heavy demand on the state. 
The history of the state need not be reviewed in this 
connection; but a single fact of outstanding importance 
must be noted. In the development of its institutions, 
as in the South generally, the county has from the begin- 
ning played a vital part. The Maryland county is not 
an aggregate of smaller units, such as towns and town- 
ships; it is the original and fundamental governing unit. 
The state began with counties; eleven were created be- 
tween 1637 and 1695. Division into election and school 
districts took place later and simply for purposes of con- 
venience. The priority of the county is, as we shall ob-
-P-A-G-E-24
6 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
serve, a fortunate circumstance from the educational 
point of view. 
As early as 1671 legislative efforts to provide schools 
or colleges ‘“‘for the education of youth in learning and 
virtue” are recorded. But despite intermittent agita- 
tion, the better part of a century passed before certain 
schools were established, which were the forerunners of 
the “academies” established during the latter part of the 
eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries. 
Of these academies we shall learn more later. Suffice 
it to say here that they represented mainly the concern 
of the state for the education of the upper classes. Not 
until 1812 was an effort made to provide elementary 
schools for the poor. 
Thereafter, developments were fairly rapid. In 1825 
an ambitious scheme, never put into full operation, 
created by legislative action a complete system of public 
instruction, beginning with a superintendent at the top 
and ending with county and district organization at the 
bottom. The system failed; but efforts did not cease. 
Forty years later a new state system was established by 
the constitution of 1864. This system, distinguished by 
the great power conferred on the State Board and the 
State Superintendent, was evidently premature; for 
three years later a new constitution sounded its death 
knell. 
The State Board and the State Superintendent were 
abolished in the following year (1868); the county 
and the district thus became supreme. Well-founded

discontent led gradually to the revival of central state 
educational agencies; and thus by 1900 the system had 
attained the form in which this volume finds it. 
Though the facts will emerge as our study proceeds, it 
may be worth while, by means of a brief statistical state- 
ment, to show in advance the extent and importance of 
Maryland’s educational interests. In the 23 counties of 
Maryland, and exclusive of Baltimore city, there are 1,935 
white and 550 colored schools; the children of school 
age (6 to 18) number 275,503 white and 63,964 colored; 
200,783 white children and 44,475 colored are enrolled. 
The state employs upward of 5,000 white and almost 
1,000 colored teachers. Its annual outlay is more than 
$5,000,000, one-half of which is spent outside the city of 
Baltimore. We are about to inquire how wisely this 
large sum is spent and whether or not the people of 
Maryland could spend it more wisely than they do.
-P-A-G-E-28
II. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 
most satisfactorily in those states in which a 
judicious combination of state and local author- 
ity has been effected. The reason is plain. The in- 
fluence of the state makes for unity of design and uni- 
formity of standard; local initiative ensures the interest, 
effort, pride, and sacrifice of the community to which the 
school belongs. The public school system of Maryland 
is of this prevailing American type. The state de- 
termines the general outlines, while the details are 
largely managed by local authorities. We shall in this 
chapter describe the organization and operation of the 
State Board, discussing its part in centralizing educa- 
tional administration. 
The State Board consists of eight members of whom 
the Governor and the State Superintendent are two. 
The remaining six, of whom at least two must represent 
the political party defeated at the last preceding election 
for Governor, are appointed by the Governor, subject 
to confirmation by the Senate. Appointments run six 
years, two terms expiring every two years. Thus a 
total change of membership requires something more than 
a single gubernatorial term. The political complexion 
8 P UBLIC education in America has developed 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
    
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 9 
may, however, be altered, whenever a Governor is elected 
whose politics differ from the politics of his predecessor. 
The present Board, a majority of whom are Republicans, 
consists of the Governor (a lawyer), the State Superin- 
tendent (an educator), a retired publisher, a banker, a 
manufacturer, a lawyer, and two college presidents. 
We shall, in a moment, discuss the functions, powers, 
and duties of the State Board. But it is important to 
call attention at the outset to the fact that the arrange- 
ment above described makes the State Department of 
Education part and parcel of the elected state govern- 
ment and thus exposes it—and, with it, public education 
in general—to the vicissitudes of state politics. It is 
not a question as to whether, at this time, or indeed at 
any time, the State Department has been “in politics.” 
It is enough to point out that the statute regulating the 
personnel of the Board looks in that direction. Gover- 
nors should, of course, be sufficiently wise and strong 
to prevent local or national politics from determining the 
composition of the State Board and thus influencing school 
administration; and Maryland may be fortunate enough 
to escape the dangers to which she is exposed by the 
terms of the statute. But it is assuredly safer to dimin- 
ish the danger. The law should be drawn on the theory 
that while the people, through the State Board, decide 
general educational policies, the Board should be so con- 
stituted as to avoid the ups and downs of party contests. 
How should a State Board of Education be constituted 
and what should be its functions? There is as yet no
-P-A-G-E-30
  10 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
agreement in practice on either point. It happens there- 
fore that in some states the Board is an ex-officio body; 
in others a lay body; sometimes it is composed of both 
laymen and educators. The duties laid upon the Board 
also vary greatly from state to state. In one place its 
functions are nominal; in another, detailed and responsi- 
ble. As a rule, the powers exercised by state boards 
have grown by accretion, uncontrolled by a clear concep- 
tion of what is aimed at. 
Meanwhile, in the light of our experience, it may safely 
be said that the State Board should be essentially a lay 
body representing the people in large matters of educa- 
tional policy and keeping the viewpoint, experience, and 
need of the layman before the school executive. Obvi- 
ously a Board, made up of laymen and meeting a few 
times a year, cannot be charged with the direct execution 
of matters of policy nor can it undertake to decide and 
supervise in matters of detail. It is rather to be re- 
garded as a criticising, suggesting, and reviewing body, 
that the Superintendent must consult and convince in 
regard to all decisions of moment. The Board cannot 
supersede the Superintendent, but it can make sure that 
he does his duty and can enormously assist him with sug- 
gestion and counsel. 
The Maryland State Board does not appear to be con- 
stituted according to any clear principle, nor have all its 
functions been logically arrived at. As the Governor and 
State Superintendent are members, the membership is 
partly ex-officio; it contains, besides, both laymen and 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Ir 
educators. Its duties are varied, not to say indiscrimi- 
nate, for it is at once a legislative, a judicial, and an 
executive agency. As a legislating educational body, it 
makes courses of study, determines the minimum re- 
quirements for the degrees conferred by the academic 
institutions of the state, passes on the qualifications of 
regular high school teachers, and classifies high schools 
that are to receive state aid. Asan executive, it is ex- 
pected to enforce the school laws, which will be described 
in the course of this report—and, when necessary, to em- 
ploy legal proceedings to that end. On the judicial side, 
it interprets school legislation, deciding controversies and 
disputes, and even possesses, though it has not used, the 
power to remove from office an inefficient County Super- 
intendent. Finally, the State Board also administers the 
state normal schools, manages the state teachers’ retire- 
ment fund, and grants professional certificates valid 
throughout the state and for life to teachers of experi- 
ence and established reputation. 
In exercising its authority and carrying out its will, 
the State Board acts through its secretary and executive 
officer, the Superintendent of Public Education. Aside 
for the moment from the question as to whether the 
State Board should or should not possess the particular 
powers above enumerated, it is clear that adequate 
execution of the law depends primarily on the State 
Superintendent. As the Superintendent is not omni- 
present and cannot make himself efficiently felt through 
circulars, blanks, and documents, he cannot make the
-P-A-G-E-32
  12 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
State Department effective unless he possesses an ade- 
quate organization and is vigorously supported both by 
the Board and by public opinion. As a matter of fact, 
not one of these three conditions is satisfactorily ful- 
filled. 
The State Superintendent’s staff, as we shall more 
fully observe in the next chapter, consists of himself, 
an assistant, and a clerk—an organization altogether 
inadequate to the duties laid upon it. Public opinion 
in the state is in the main indifferent. The State Board, 
partly for this reason, partly because of the way it is 
constituted, frequently acts on the theory that friendly 
and patient pressure may in the long run accomplish 
more than would be achieved by vigorous measures. 
It follows inevitably that the State Board does not en- 
force all the laws. In some instances the law is simply 
ignored; in others it is applied with considerable laxity. 
For example, the statute requires that county superin- 
tendents “shall devote their entire time to public school 
business.”? The State Board of Education is not un- 
aware of the fact that in the counties of Somerset, 
Calvert, and Montgomery the county superintendents 
now in office do not ‘‘devote their entire time to public 
school business.” Again, the law provides that ‘no 
persons shall be employed as teachers unless such per- 
sons shall hold a certificate of qualification.”? The 
State Board knows that this law is disregarded, as, for   
1Public School Laws of Maryland, Chap. XI, Sec. 80. 
2Public School Laws of Maryland, Chap VIII, Sec. 53.
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 13 
example, in the counties of Caroline and Dorchester. 
Thus neither of these important statutes is well enforced. 
It must, however, in fairness be said that inefficiency 
sometimes results from defects in the law itself. For 
example, nothing is more important than uniformity at 
a high level in the training of teachers. Unfortunately, 
in Maryland, several agencies, working independently 
of each other, participate in determining the qualifications 
of teachers. The State Board grants teaching certifi- 
cates valid for life, and in so far regulates one important 
part of the teaching profession. At the same time, the 
State Superintendent and the county superintendents 
control other parts of the teaching profession. Thus, 
in respect to certification—a matter of crucial importance 
—the law prevents the execution of a consistent and 
effective policy. 
Again, waste or ineffectiveness results when powers 
which should be lodged in the State Superintendent are 
delegated to the State Board. The Board is, for ex- 
ample, required to interpret the laws and to decide 
controversies arising under them. Such questions are 
at times presented to the Board as part of the regular 
docket; at times special meetings are called for their 
consideration, now at Annapolis, again at some remote 
corner of the state. Perhaps one-fourth of the Board’s 
time is thus consumed. If the Board had not had to sit 
as a court in such matters, there would probably have 
been no occasion to hold six special meetings in 1912, four 
in 1913, and five in 1915.  
-P-A-G-E-34
  14 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
Here again the law is responsible for inefficiency. The 
State Board should not be required to exercise judicial 
functions. Its members are widely scattered; most of 
them lack legal training and experience; they meet regu- 
larly only four times a year, and even then but for a few 
hours. They should not be expected to deal with mat- 
ters of minute detail or technical nature. The trained 
Superintendent who has their confidence should act for 
them and without their intervention in deciding tech- 
nical points. Such is already the practice in certain 
states—among others, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, 
and Virginia—in all of which the interpretation of the 
school law and the handling of appeals from county and 
town authorities are given over to the executive officer of 
the Board. 
To some extent inefficiency has also arisen because the 
Board, given a specific responsibility, has misconceived 
the manner in which that responsibility should be met. 
The State Board is—as it should be—the Board of 
Trustees of the state normal schools. It has, indeed, 
no more important duty, for from these schools, the 
Baltimore Normal School, the Frostburg Normal School, 
and the Normal and Industrial School at Bowie, come 
and will continue to come the major part of the trained 
teachers in the elementary schools of the state. 
Now, what should the board of trustees of a normal 
school do? In the first place, the board should select 
the school head, and in conference with him determine 
the general policy of the institution. It should visit,
-P-A-G-E-35

-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 15 
inspect, and control. But it should not conduct the 
school. If the head of the institution is competent, he 
should, in coéperation with the faculty of the institution, 
devise detailed plans and submit nominations to the 
State Board. In respect to these matters, the Board 
should be a sort of jury, whom the principal and his 
associates must convince of the propriety and wisdom of 
their suggestions. It is, of course, within the duty of 
the Board also to make suggestions in the course of their 
discussions. But the initiative should lie with the school 
head and staff. The Board cannot possess the technical 
knowledge, training, and experience, nor has it the time, 
to “‘run” the school. Unless the head and faculty of the 
normal schools are capable of discharging their proper 
functions, they are unequal to their task and should be 
replaced. 
The State Board now manages the normal schools 
through committees. Each institution is in charge of a 
committee made up of three members of the State Board, 
the chairman of the Committee being in a sense its repre- 
sentative and active agent. These sub-committees are 
so important that the State Board is in danger of exces- 
sive deference to them in the appointment of principals 
and teachers and in the determination of details of policy. 
To be sure, the principals of the normal schools have the 
right to appear before the Board on questions connected 
with their institutions. But advantage is seldom taken 
of this privilege. There is, moreover, no evidence to 
show that principals have been or have been expected to 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
16 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
be properly active in making known the larger needs of 
their schools or in outlining the steps in advance to be 
taken by them. Indeed, the more important changes in 
the course of study, in entrance requirements and the 
like, made within recent years, have had their origin 
with the State Superintendent. Again, principals have 
no particular responsibility in the matter of finding and 
recommending to the State Board qualified teachers to 
fill vacancies. Applications for positions may be sent to 
them, but quite as often they are sent to the State Board. 
Even though such applications are subsequently referred 
to the principal, it is evident that there exists an unfortu- 
nate doubt as to just where initiative belongs. 
The State Board should of course continue to exercise 
a strong and vigilant control over the normal schools, but 
the character of this control needs to be modified. Di- 
rect responsibility should be imposed upon the principals 
for working out plans for the training of teachers and for 
the development and improvement of their schools. 
Larger opportunity should be afforded them for the 
exercise of their powers in the management of their re- 
spective institutions. Thereupon the State Board must 
hold them to strict account for results. 
In respect to other technical points, the policy of the 
Board has been generally sound. The Board, for ex- 
ample, is authorized to prepare courses of study. In the 
elementary schools the statute specifies the subjects, 
but leaves the Board to determine details; in the high 
schools, normal schools, and colleges, the Board has  
-P-A-G-E-39
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 17 
practically complete power. In these matters the 
Board depends, as it should depend, on its executive offi- 
cer to lead, suggest, and devise. The details of the pre- 
scribed curricula will be taken up in connection with the 
different types of school. Suffice it at this point to say 
that the State Board, through its executive officer, has 
given no little attention of late years to courses of study, 
to the end that instruction might be better adapted to 
economic and social needs. The courses of study for both 
the elementary schools and the high schools were re- 
vised in 1901, in 1907, and in 1913. Important changes 
were made in the course for the normal schools in 1905 
and in 1908, and a complete revision of college courses 
for teachers is now under way. As we shall hereafter 
see,! it is, however, one thing to recast a course of 
study and another thing to recast the actual instruction 
given in the schools. The course of study, while still 
needing revision, has probably improved in recent years 
rather faster than the teaching through which it is ad- 
ministered. 
The Board has, though not without some excuse,” 
done less well in regard to its recording and reporting 
methods. As far back as 1872, the legislature empow- 
ered the State Board ‘‘to issue a uniform series of blanks 
for the use of teachers and of county boards, and to re- 
quire all records to be kept and reports to be made on 
these forms.”’ Accordingly, the State Board through its 
1Chapter VIII, “Instruction.” 
2Viz., the lack of necessary assistance.  
-P-A-G-E-40
  18 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
executive officer has prescribed a system of school 
records covering, among other things, the financial 
transactions of the county boards, the daily records and 
term reports of the teachers, records and reports for ap- 
proved high schools, and forms for the annual report of 
the county superintendents—a degree of uniformity 
found in few other states. The value of these uniform 
records can scarcely be overestimated, for modern school 
administration rests not upon personal opinion, but 
upon objective facts, such as these forms aim to elicit. 
Unfortunately, the blanks now prescribed by the State 
Board are by no means perfect, either as to form or as 
to the data called for. It would be a great improvement 
to adopt the financial forms suggested by the National 
Bureau of Education and the educational blanks rec- 
ommended by the Committee of the National Education 
Association on Uniform Blanks and Reports. 
There is, of course, no virtue in the mere accumulation 
of statistical data in the State Department of Education. 
The endless filling out of blanks is largely a waste of time 
unless the data accumulated are studied, interpreted, and 
utilized. As the Board is required by law to issue an 
annual Report and is allowed in its discretion to issue 
special pamphlets from time to time, opportunity to 
utilize the data collected cannot be said to be lacking. 
The Reports thus far issued, while comparing not un- 
favorably with reports issued by many other states, do 
not make effective use of the material available. A 
school report should not only give an account of what has
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 19 
happened, but should develop, expound, and recommend 
educational policy. It should exhibit vividly not only 
achievements, but needs, difficulties, and opportunities 
aswell. A well-written report is the most effective means 
of communication between the Board of Education and 
the people of the state. 
The Annual Report of the State Board, prepared by 
the Superintendent, is now a volume of some 400 pages. 
It could be greatly reduced, and to that extent improved 
as a means of communication, by omitting such matter 
as the abstract of. the proceedings of the Maryland State 
Teachers’ Association, which are, as a matter of fact, 
separately published by the Department, and the alpha- 
betical list of the teachers of the state—a separate publi- 
cation of which would serve the purpose better. The 
reports of the county school boards could be much 
condensed. In place of what is thus omitted, the Report, 
utilizing the data obtained on the blanks above de- 
scribed, should present in narrative and graphic form the 
essential facts bearing upon the preparation and salaries 
of teachers, the attendance and classification of children, 
the condition of schoolhouses, and the financial support 
of the school system. Such information would supply 
a solid basis for deciding upon educational policies and 
for determining administrative and supervisory action. 
Each report might well carry some important message 
to the people. One might “feature” Compulsory 
School Attendance, another, The Sanitary Conditions 
and Care of Schoolhouses, still another, Better Pre-
-P-A-G-E-42
  20 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
pared Teachers. Obviously the executive officer of the 
Board, with his present force, cannot act on these sugges- 
tions. This, however, is simply another reason for plac- 
ing larger resources at its command. 
The State Board is not unmindful of the value of an 
aroused public interest in education. Indeed, not a little 
has been done within the last two years to centre the at- 
tention of the people upon their schools. Educational 
mass-meetings and school exhibits, authorized and en- 
couraged by the State Board, were held in 1914 in all 
but two counties of the state. There was usually a 
parade of the school children of the county, competitive 
athletic games, fancy drills, a display of school work, and 
a mass-meeting at which addresses were given by persons 
of prominence upon the work and needs of the schools. 
As many as eight to ten thousand attended these Educa- 
tional Rallies in a single county. Some of those attending 
realized for the first time the number of children there 
are to be educated. Others saw for the first time an ex- 
hibit of what the modern school does, and appreciated as 
never before the significance of public education to the 
youth of the state. Few, indeed, of all the many thou- 
sands attending these great meetings, failed to pledge 
their loyal support to the schools. 
The State Board has wisely resolved to continue this 
campaign for enlightened public sentiment. The failure 
year after year of counties to take advantage of the 
liberal aid offered by the state for particular kinds of 
elementary education; the demand of certain counties to

-P-A-G-E-45
  
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 21 
be exempt from the provisions of laws regulating the 
length of the school term, the minimum salary for teach- 
ers, compulsory school attendance and the like; the 
meagre local support of the schools in certain counties— 
are all due more to the stagnant condition of public 
sentiment than to any other single cause. It is the 
business of the State Board not only to carry on, but to 
develop, popular education as fast as public sentiment 
can be created and the necessary resources found. 
Summarizing, we may conclude that the Maryland 
statutes are sound in providing a State Board of Educa- 
tion, though the body as constituted requires reconstruc- 
tion. The staff of the office should be increased so that 
the laws can be more intelligently and uniformly applied; 
and largely through its activities an aroused public opin- 
ion must be developed, ready to follow when the state 
authorities give the word. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
Ill. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC 
EDUCATION 
T: State Superintendent of Public Education 
in an American commonwealth is the head of its 
public school system. As such, he is the execu- 
tive officer of the State Board; he represents the Board in 
the long intervals between its meetings; he is the profes- 
sional adviser of the Board in session; his position makes 
it possible for him to unite and to direct the educational 
forces of the state. Whatever the limits upon his legal 
powers in this respect, a man of tact, force, and resource- 
fulness can exert an influence that goes far beyond his 
actual authority. As all our states are, educationally 
speaking, still in the relatively early stages of their devel- 
opment, the state superintendency offers a splendid field 
for well-endowed and well-trained educational statesmen. 
In Maryland the Superintendent of Public Education 
is appointed by the Governor in the second year of his 
term, “by and with the consent of the Senate” and holds 
office for four years—as does the Governor who appoints 
him. Professional qualifications there are none, the 
vague word “competent” being the only limitation upon 
the Governor’s freedom of choice. The salary of the 
Superintendent, which may not exceed $3,000 a year, is

-P-A-G-E-49
  THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT 23 
fixed by the State Board, which possesses also a qualified 
veto on his removal. For though the Governor may re- 
move the State Superintendent at his pleasure, the act, 
to be valid, must be sanctioned by a vote of two-thirds 
of the Board. In these provisions, as in the provisions 
regulating appointment to the State Board, there is, 
once more, evidence of lack of clear thinking. For the 
Superintendent, who is the state’s educational executive, 
should be chosen, not by the Governor, but by a board as 
far removed from political influences as possible, for a 
term either indefinite or long enough to avoid danger of 
political complications. 
Aside from his duties as member of the State Board, 
and as the executive who carries out the Board’s orders, 
the Superintendent of Public Education exercises certain 
powers and performs certain duties in his individual capac- 
ity. These duties are both supervisory and inspectional 
in character. For example, he accepts or rejects in his 
discretion normal school and college diplomas issued by 
other states; defines the qualifications of teachers of 
special branches in high school domestic science, manual 
training, etc.; rates teachers who, not being normal school 
graduates, offer instead some supposedly equivalent 
training plus practical experience; and examines the 
reports and expenditures of the county school boards. 
The Superintendent is, moreover, authorized to prepare 
and distribute pamphlets to teachers giving information 
as to the best methods of instruction in the various 
studies pursued in the schools.
-P-A-G-E-50
  24 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
For our present purpose it is immaterial whether the 
Superintendent is called on to doa particular thing in his 
own capacity or on the order of the State Board. Our real 
concern is as to the efficiency with which the work of the 
department has been carried on. In passing judgment 
on this point, an important distinction must be made. 
The “‘mechanics”’ of the office have been well attended 
to, better indeed than one could reasonably expect with 
existing facilities. Modern methods of handling business 
have been introduced, correspondence is promptly dis- 
posed of, records are well kept and easily accessible. On 
the other hand, the larger opportunities have not been 
met and under existing circumstances cannot be met. 
True enough, the department has, over and above the 
explicit requirements of the statute, in recent years initi- 
ated certain progressive measures of great importance: it 
has, for example, secured legislation providing for state 
aid to and supervision of high schools, for state certifica- 
tion of high school teachers, and for a minimum profes- 
sional training in case of elementary school teachers. 
-These measures, however, represent only a “drive” in 
one direction or another. The department has been 
unable to follow them up vigorously and steadily or to 
give the requisite attention to other large problems of 
equal urgency, 
Thereasonis plain. Nothingis simpler than to author- 
ize or require the State Superintendent to ‘“‘supervise,” 
“inspect,” “examine,” or “pass upon.” But neither 
inspection, supervision, nor examination can avail, unless
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT 25 
an adequate trained organization is provided through 
which he can work. As has been pointed out in the pre- 
ceding chapter, the force at the Superintendent’s disposal 
is utterly insufficient. He hasa single assistant appointed 
with the approval of the State Board at a salary of $2,000 
and one clerk at a salary not to exceed $1,200. In 
addition to his own salary, he has an expense allowance 
of five hundred dollars, and one thousand dollars more 
for furniture, supplies, and printing. Three persons thus 
constitute the entire staff at the disposal of the State Su- 
perintendent of Education in Maryland. It goes without 
saying that the functions which we have enumerated sim- 
ply cannot be effectively discharged by this organization. 
In lieu of an organized and specialized staff of which 
he would be the directing and inspiring chief, the State 
Superintendent of Maryland obtains, as best he can, such 
knowledge of school conditions as will enable him and the 
State Board to perform their various duties as intelli- 
gently as may be. He therefore spends the major por- 
tion of his time in actually visiting schools in different 
parts of the state. Obviously he cannot thoroughly 
cover the field. He is thus compelled to assume that by 
hastily “sampling” the situation here and there, he ob- 
tains a fairly adequate conception of existing conditions. 
Thus he glances at the school grounds, notes the condi- 
tions of the buildings, and examines cursorily the school 
  
*The State Board has an appropriation of $3,000 to cover the expenses 
of members in attending meetings, printing, supplies, etc. The depart- 
ment therefore costs the state $10,700 a year, all told.
-P-A-G-E-52
  26 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
equipment. His main concern, in the brief period at his 
disposal, is, however, the teaching in progress. On the 
basis of a hurried inspection advice is tendered to teach- 
ers, principals, and school officials. In addition to these 
efforts to study and to improve schools scattered through- 
out the state, the Superintendent frequently participates 
in teachers’ meetings and civic conferences. He main- 
tains, besides, an active and voluminous correspondence 
with principals, county superintendents, and County 
School Board members throughout the state. Aside 
from information thus acquired, the Superintendent can 
know only what the county authorities report to him. 
But these reports are of very uneven quality; and the state 
department can under existing conditions do little either 
to improve them or to utilize the data which they obtain. 
The high school situation may be cited to show the 
folly of not giving the State Superintendent staff enough 
to ensure the wise expenditure of the state’s money or the 
effective execution of the state’s policy. Inigi1o a 
complete high school reorganization was undertaken on 
the basis of state aid. It was provided that, on the 
basis of reports made by high school principals, and 
inspections made by the State Superintendent, the high 
schools should be classified in two groups, those of the 
first group to receive an annual maximum grant of 
$2,500 each, those of the second group to receive an an- 
nual maximum grant of $1,400 each.!_ The law provides 
4In 1914 there were 29 first-class high schools, receiving from the state 
$67,700; 36 second-class high schools, receiving $50,400.
-P-A-G-E-53
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT 27 
that every state-aided high school shall be inspected 
annually; if, on notification of defects, the proper remedial 
steps are not taken, the state subsidy is to cease. 
The law thus creates for the State Superintendent the 
opportunity to direct the high school development of the 
state. He simply cannot take full advantage of this 
opportunity. The letter of the law has indeed been com- 
plied with: the Superintendent or his assistant has visited 
the high schools once a year. But the visit has been 
casual, concerning itself with ascertaining whether the 
formal requirements of the statute are complied with. 
Again, the last General Assembly provided that no per- 
son is to serve ‘‘as principal or assistant teacher (in a 
state-aided high school) whose qualifications have not 
been passed upon by the State Board of Education.” 
To carry out the provisions of this act, the Board will 
need to prescribe the minimum qualifications for high 
school teachers, including principals, and then to examine 
the qualifications of the 300 regular high school teachers 
in service. Thus far the State Board has failed to move, 
not because it is difficult to prescribe the minimum 
qualifications of high school teachers, but rather, as 
we might suppose, because its executive officer, upon 
whom the duty falls, lacks the necessary time and assist- 
ance. 
One more illustration, taken from a different field, that 
of school finance, may be worth giving. The public 
schools of Maryland are supported partly by local tax- 
ation, partly by apportionment of a state fund. The
-P-A-G-E-54
    
28 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
State Superintendent is expected to safeguard the interest 
of both the state and the local taxpayer by examining 
the accounts of county school boards and reporting 
thereon to the State Board. It was evidently intended 
that the State Board should thus exercise a reasonable 
control over the finances of the county boards, in refer- 
ence to acts omitted as well as acts committed. At any 
rate, such should be the policy of the state. Though the 
bookkeeping of the county boards is fixed except in 
minor details by the forms prescribed by the State Board 
of Education, the forms in use are quite defective. It is, 
for example, difficult to determine from them the exact 
financial status of a County Board, no separate accounts 
being kept with funded debt, current loans, ordinary 
receipts, and the like. It is even more difficult to de- 
termine the expenditure for separate items such, for 
instance, as new buildings, repairs, upkeep, and main- 
tenance; and it is quite impossible to tell what the ele- 
mentary schools and the high schools are each costing. 
The use of antiquated forms is undoubtedly to be 
attributed to the lack of a skilled accountant in the 
Superintendent’s office. And the same lack accounts for 
the fact that, having received these reports, the State 
Superintendent can simply check them up and file them 
away. 
The moral of the foregoing discussion is obvious. The 
Superintendent of Public Education in Maryland 
cannot be the state’s educational leader unless he has 
proper assistance and support. The office can no longer
-P-A-G-E-55
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT 29 
be conducted with its present force or on its present 
allowance. In ways that will appear as we proceed, the 
State Superintendent must be assisted by adding to his 
resources a few experts capable of taking the field under 
his direction in charge of specialized activities.
-P-A-G-E-56
  IV. THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES 
ENTRAL control of public education is thus, as 
C we have now seen, in the hands of the State Board 
and the Superintendent of Public Education. 
Local control is, in the main, exercised by a board of 
county school commissioners. The present chapter will 
discuss the functions of the local authorities and their re- 
lations with the state department. 
Three forms of local educational administration are in 
use in this country: the district system, the township 
system, and the county unit. Of these the district and 
the county represent the two extremes. A word as to 
the district system may assist us to appreciate the im- 
portance of the form of organization that Maryland 
possesses. 
Under the district system every school, as a rule, has 
an independent board of trustees, which “runs” the 
school, levying and collecting taxes, erecting the school- 
house, determining the length of the term, prescribing 
the curriculum, selecting text-books, and employing the 
teacher. The mere description at once suggests the 
defects of the scheme. In the first place, no state and 
no county contains as many persons qualified to manage 
schools intelligently as the district system requires.

THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES 31 
Again, the district system accepts all sorts of inequalities 
in educational facilities and efforts. One district may 
possess a good school with ample grounds and comfort- 
able buildings, while in another, close by, the school is 
wretchedly poor. No agency exists which can diminish 
these divergencies by working toward a general plan. 
Finally, teachers need teamwork and supervision if they 
are to keep in touch with professional progress. But 
teamwork and supervision presuppose a larger area than 
the district. The truth is that the district school re- 
flects pioneer conditions. It goes back to the time when 
an isolated group, desiring some sort of education for its 
children, pooled its meagre resources in order to establish 
a neighborhood school. Increased wealth, larger num- 
bers, improved communications, and more complicated 
educational requirements render the district system and 
the district school obsolete. 
As the county organization offers a wider service, it 
tends to attract able men into the County Board; and as 
this body can dispose in its discretion of the total yield 
of the county school taxes plus the state apportionment, 
something like statesmanship may be employed in 
locating, equipping, and consolidating schools. Educa- 
tional opportunities can thus more or less be equalized. 
The situation may, in a word, be viewed as a whole, 
the county schools forming a system in the development 
of which intelligence and design may be employed— 
provided, of course, the people are wise enough to take 
advantage of their opportunities.

Maryland is fortunate in possessing the county as the 
educational unit. Nevertheless, it has by no means 
realized to the full the advantages of the county type 
of organization, partly, as we shall see, because political 
and personal considerations are too apt to influence the 
selection and the policy of commissioners, partly because 
in the selection of teachers a vestige of the district sys- 
tem confuses and weakens administration. 
The county boards of education in Maryland are 
appointed by the Governor and are composed of six mem- 
bers each in six counties,! and of three in the remaining 
counties. Continuity of service is secured through a 
six-year term, and through so ordering the appointments 
that there are at the end of each second year not to ex- 
ceed two vacancies in the large counties and not more 
than one in the small counties. The County Board ap- 
points three district trustees for each schoolhouse dis- 
trict. These district trustees are the custodians of the 
school property and have the power to select the principal 
teacher, subject to the approval of the County Board. 
All subordinate teachers and all high school teachers are 
appointed by the County Board. The district trustees 
may also remove any teacher they themselves appoint, 
though the teacher retains the right of appeal to the 
County Board. To these powers of the district trustees 
we shall have occasion later to recur. 
The method of appointing the members of the County

ington, and Montgomery.

Board is open to question. Undoubtedly, appointment 
by the Governor might draw into service men of character 
and standing who would not be willing to wage an elec- 
toral campaign for the post. The system, however, does 
not always work in that way. The law provides that at 
least two of the members in large counties and at least 
one in small counties must be of the political party 
defeated in the last election, and that these appoint- 
ments must be made “by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate.” These limitations make the 
partisan consideration needlessly prominent; in conse- 
quence, appointments are viewed by local politicians 
and local political organizations as ‘‘spoils,” so that the 
County Board of Education is almost everywhere looked 
upon as a “Democratic” board or as a “Republican” 
board, with party allegiance and party interests to con- 
sider. Again, the “advice and consent of the Senate” 
have come to mean, not the approval of the entire Senate, 
but the approval of the local senator. Indeed, to such a 
pass has senatorial courtesy come, that the Senate flatly 
refuses to confirm an appointment not endorsed by the 
local senator. And the local senator is tempted to act 
not as the representative of the people, but rather as the 
spokesman of the county political organization. The 
office of county school commissioner is thus usually re- 
garded as a political office, the public being for the most 
part indifferent to the dangers involved in this concep- 
tion. The county boards are therefore in the main 
seriously infected with politics.
-P-A-G-E-62
    
34 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
In order to discharge its functions the County Board 
must be in position to procure adequate school funds, to 
select the County Superintendent, and, through him and 
his assistants, to provide suitable facilities and com- 
petent teachers, whose work is from time to time in- 
spected and supervised. Let us now see how the county 
boards do their work. 
Money is the first requisite—money for buildings, for 
up-keep, for equipment, for teachers and supervision, 
but county school boards are not ‘“‘authorized, empow- 
ered, directed, and required to levy and collect”? such 
taxes as will be adequate to maintain an efficient school 
system throughout the county. The tax-levying body 
of the county is the county board of commissioners, who 
are required under the law to levy such sums of money 
as the County School Board requests for the schools, 
provided such sums shall not exceed 15 cents on each 
$100 of the taxable property of the county; whether or 
not the county commissioners shall levy any amount in 
excess of 15 cents is left entirely to their discretion. 
Satisfactory county schools cannot possibly be main- 
tained on a local levy of 15 cents on each $100; in fact, 
every county of the state spends in excess of this rate. 
This limitation practically transfers the control of school 
finances from the County School Board to the county 
commissioners: thus, while the county school boards are, 
both by law and by the people, held responsible for the 
schools, they are in practice deprived of the financial 
power to meet their responsibility.

  THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES 35 
The result is easily foreseen. The county commis- 
sioners are also a political body. Elected as they not 
infrequently are upon a platform of economy, and having, 
as is human, their own political future as well as that of 
their party in view, they often give scant attention to the 
requests of the county school boards for funds in excess of 
15 cents on the $100, quite regardless of the merits of the 
application. The records of every county in the state 
show how seldom the full requests of the school boards 
for funds are granted by the county commissioners. 
Here and there a school board, on easy terms with the 
commissioners, makes no formal request for funds; the 
subject is talked over informally and an agreement 
reached. Elsewhere, requests are cut year after year, 
even in the face of the fact that in some instances the 
schools are kept open by county boards by means of 
current loans. Where the commissioners and the 
majority of the school board happen to be of the same 
political faith, the school board members are at times 
asked to modify their requests on the grounds of party 
loyalty or political expediency. Even the county 
superintendents do not escape. Persons with powerful 
political connections have been known to appeal to them, 
to reclassify teachers, in order to lower their salaries, and 
thus reduce the amount of money needed by the County 
School Board. In one instance that came to our notice 
the teachers were actually reclassified; in another, occur- 
ring in the spring of 1915, be it said to the honor of the 
Superintendent, the intermediary was defied to do his
-P-A-G-E-66
    
36 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
worst. To protect the schools against such dangers, 
five of the larger counties of the state have secured from 
the General Assembly special legislation rendering man- 
datory a higher levy by the board of county commissioners 
than that provided by the general law. Thus, Allegany 
may make a levy of 31 cents on $100 for usual expenses, 
and an additional 7 cents for buildings; Baltimore County 
may levy 31 cents and 9g cents, respectively; while Mont- 
gomery County requires its county commissioners to 
meet any demand made by the school board for the 
support of the elementary schools. In Frederick and 
Prince George counties the school authorities secured 
local laws providing for larger teachers’ salaries, and the 
county commissioners are required to levy the necessary 
funds. 
The most serious difficulties are usually encountered 
when funds are requested for the erection of new school- 
houses. A few boards of county commissioners make 
such allowance, but only a few. It does not follow that 
the rest get no money at all for new buildings; they get it, 
however, in ways that are roundabout and inefficient. 
Two counties—Allegany and Baltimore—have procured 
from the legislature laws compelling the commissioners to 
make a separate levy for buildings. But in the majority 
of counties almost all the money spent on new buildings 
within the last half decade has been wrung from the 
county commissioners through special laws, requiring a 
levy or a bond issue. Indeed, some counties—for ex- 
ample, Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary’s, have had to
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES Bi) 
appeal to the General Assembly to secure funds even for 
the erection of schoolhouses costing less than $600. 
The methods used by the county commissioners in 
granting funds aid them to shirk their responsibility. 
The requests of the school boards are as a rule presented 
by items; definite sums are asked for new buildings, for 
maintenance, for teachers, etc. But the county com- 
missioners, as a rule, make a lump allowance, less than the 
total sum asked for, and generally omit to state which 
items have been granted in full and which cut or refused 
altogether. This lump sum includes, ordinarily, enough 
for teachers’ salaries and operating expenses; but for 
years in certain counties—Calvert and Charles, for in- 
stance—little has been provided even for repairs, to say 
nothing of the betterment of the plant, the commissioners 
trusting to the members of the County School Board to 
use their own ingenuity in keeping the schools open and 
some kind of roof over the heads of the children. To 
check this way of escaping responsibility, Montgomery 
County obtained special legislation which provides for a 
detailed school budget and compels the county commis- 
sioners to make their allowances by items. 
Such funds as the school boards obtain are usually 
administered with somewhat more than ordinary effi- 
ciency. Engaged in business and in commercial farming, 
as the great majority of the members are, it is natural 
that they should take a close interest in the business 
aspects of education. The county unit facilitates the 
use of intelligent methods of accounting, and perhaps
-P-A-G-E-68
    
38 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
explains the introduction of a uniform accounting system 
throughout the state. Bills are audited by the Board 
members, and accounts are kept by the County Superin- 
tendent, the assistant superintendent, or the clerk. Ina 
few cases—Allegany County, for instance—these ac- 
counts are examined monthly by an outside accountant; 
usually, however, this outside audit is made once a year, 
as in Howard County; however, there are a few counties 
—Garrett is an example—where no audit at all is made 
by an outside agency. 
More or less uniformity of method has also been de- 
veloped in handling routine matters of school supplies, 
fuel, and repairs. In some counties a blank is employed 
by the district trustees to indicate to the County Board 
what repairs, etc., are deemed necessary. Elsewhere the 
County Board members make visits with the County 
Superintendent to decide what repairs are to be under- 
taken. Occasionally as much as a week is thus spent. 
On jobs of sufficient magnitude competitive bids are 
received. Work done under contract is supervised by 
the County Superintendent or his assistant; if a local man 
is employed he is more often subject to the direction of 
the district trustees. In our judgment these details are, 
as a rule, honestly and efficiently managed. 
The building problem has been less happily handled. 
The situation is obviously not a simple one. Funds are 
limited; old buildings can neither be torn down nor 
reconstructed to keep pace with modern notions of 
construction, as to size of classrooms, lighting, cloak-

THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES 39 
rooms, heating arrangements, closets, etc. On the other 
hand, these difficulties make it all the more imperative 
that new buildings should be soundly planned and that 
repairs and remodelling should be carried on with up-to- 
date models in mind. The State Department should 
exercise a general control over building operations, as it 
does in Minnesota, for example. As a matter of fact, 
the state has no policy and only a few counties, Allegany, 
Baltimore, Wicomico, and Queen Anne’s, among them, 
handle this problem with intelligence. As for the rest, 
schoolhouses of obsolete type are still constructed, just 
as though standard types, soundly planned in respect to 
light, hygiene, drainage, etc., had not been evolved and 
were not elsewhere in use. District School No. 3, re- 
cently built in the third school district of Calvert County, 
shows less appreciation of sound principles of school 
architecture than was shown in the erection of certain 
schoolhouses in the same county fifty years ago; the new 
consolidated schoolhouse at Clarksville, Howard County, 
ignores the principles of good lighting; city school build- 
ings costing from $12,000 to $15,000 and disregarding 
modern ideas as to hygiene and sanitation have recently 
been erected at North East, Cecil County; at St. Mich- 
aels, Talbot County; at Accident, Garrett County, and 
at Federalsburg, Caroline County. 
Highly objectionable is a practice, not altogether in- 
frequent, by which both County Board and County 
Superintendent have been completely deprived of con- 
trol in certain cases. Buildings were needed, for example,
-P-A-G-E-72
  40 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
at Hyattsville, Prince George County, and at Kennedy- 
ville, Kent County. The county commissioners refused 
the necessary funds. ‘Influential’ citizens then ap- 
pealed to the General Assembly which was thus induced 
to pass special legislation making mandatory upon the 
county commissioners the raising of the sum desired. 
In both the instances under discussion the acts named a 
local committee to have charge of the construction. 
Such legislation is absolutely pernicious. It encourages 
legislative favoritism and log-rolling, destroys local re- 
sponsibility, discourages systematic planning by the 
county authorities, lodges control in inexpert hands, and 
in the end produces an obsolete school building at great 
expense. For this reason the buildings erected at 
Hyattsville and Kennedyville are defective in respect to 
ventilating, lighting, and internal arrangement. 
We have already mentioned the fact that the county 
school boards appoint district school trustees, who choose 
and may remove the principal teacher. Politically 
selected county boards are, of course, apt to choose the 
district trustees on a partisan basis. The way is thus 
open for the introduction of politics into the management 
of every school. As a rule, the district trustees do little. 
They do not meet to talk over school affairs with the 
teacher; they take no especial interest in the schoolhouse 
or the school grounds. They wake up, however, when a 
teacher is to be appointed or dismissed, but the danger is 
great that their action will not be based purely on educa- 
tional considerations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE COUNTY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES 4 
We have in a previous chapter discussed the relation 
of the State Board of Education to the State Superintend- 
ent; its counterpart is to be found in the relation of the 
County Board to the County Superintendent. The 
County Board is a small, lay, unpaid body, composed of 
farmers, business men, physicians, or lawyers, more or less 
interested in public education and more or less competent 
to look after it in a general way, but necessarily without 
professional knowledge or experience. Under these cir- 
cumstances, while accepting from the state department 
their general policies, they look to the county superin- 
tendent for local leadership. Thus far, we have dis- 
cussed mainly the composition of the county boards and 
the transaction of certain business matters—the raising 
of funds and the erection of buildings—as to all of which 
we conclude that Maryland derives less benefit than it 
should and might from its superior type of school admin- 
istration. There remain to be considered the ways in 
which the county boards discharge their specifically 
educational responsibilities. This can, however, be most 
advantageously discussed in connection with the County 
Superintendent, to which subject the next chapter will 
be devoted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
Vv. THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF 
SCHOOLS 
HE County Superintendent of Schools occupies 
[ in respect to the county schools the same posi- 
tion as the City Superintendent occupies in 
respect to the city schools. He is the expert adviser of 
the County School Board on all matters of educational 
policy; he supplies professional inspiration to the teaching 
staff of the county; he must be the organizer and leader of 
public opinion if increasing popular support and inter- 
est are to be won. In addition, as secretary-treasurer of 
the County Board he is its business representative and 
executive agent in financial and other matters. 
What kind of person must the County Superintendent 
be if he is to fulfill these specifications? If the County 
Superintendent is to be the source of professional inspira- 
tion and popular leadership, he must be a trained educa- 
tor, familiar with modern ideas as to curriculum, method, 
and supervision; he must be a man of weight in the 
community; he must command the respect of the County 
Board; and he must hold his office long enough to develop 
an educational program. Even so, it is clear that 
no one person can himself perform all the duties of 
the County Superintendent. The County Superintend- 
42
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 43 
ent must therefore have at least a minimum of clerical 
and professional assistance—a specialized “staff” of 
modest proportions. 
Now, what are the facts? The county superintend- 
ents are elected by the politically constituted county 
boards. The politicians view the county superintend- 
ency as “‘spoils,”’ and in most counties the indifference of 
the people permits them to dispose of it on that basis. 
A general election, bringing about a change in party 
control, is scarcely over before political candidates are 
brought forth and ‘“‘groomed” for this important office. 
In the four years during which the Republicans were in 
power—1896-1900—new county superintendents were 
chosen in 19 out of the 23 counties of the state, 11 of them 
in the very year when the county school boards became 
Republican. In the first year of the new Democratic 
administration of 1900, 16 new county superintendents 
were appointed, whereas during the ensuing 11 years, 
aside from removals by death, there was a total of only 
11changes. Similarly, the first three years of the present 
Republican control witnessed the election of 12 new 
superintendents. Some of these changes were indeed 
for the better; but as long as a political upset is the 
inciting cause, there can be no certainty that changes 
will insure to the public advantage. Luckily, these 
deplorable conditions are not universal. In a few—a 
very few—counties, politics, as we shall shortly see, play 
no part in either the selection or retention of the county 
superintendents. While a dozen superintendents have
-P-A-G-E-76
  44 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
served three years or less, three have been in office for 
fourteen years. 
Though nothing can be said in extenuation of the 
county boards, in so far as their choice of the County 
Superintendent is influenced by political considerations, 
it must in fairness be added that highly desirable candi- 
dates would not be likely to covet the post in most 
counties under existing circumstances. The law makes 
no stipulations as to the professional qualifications or the 
salary of the incumbent. Of 23 county superintendents, 
one receives $5,000 a year, one $3,000, one $2,250. Of 
the remaining 20, one receives $800 a year, 6 receive from 
$1,200 to $1,500, and 13 from $1,600 to $2,000. In addi- 
tion there is an allowance of from $100 to $500 for ex- 
penses incurred in visiting schools, though Garrett 
County makes no allowance, and Harford and St. Mary’s 
only $25. One cannot be surprised, therefore, to find that 
such positions have not attracted trained men. In- 
deed, three county superintendents have had less than a 
high school education and four-of them never went be- 
yond the high school. Only one of the seven has added 
to his initial preparation, and he only to the extent of six 
weeks at a summer school. Of those remaining, one is a 
normal school graduate with a summer term of profes- 
sional work. Though fifteen hold college and university 
degrees, yet not more than six of the fifteen have made 
special and professional preparation for their work. 
Conditions are aggravated by the almost universal 
lack of competent assistants. The law, while permitting
-P-A-G-E-77
THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 45 
the county boards to expend thousands annually in their 
discretion, forbids the employment of even a clerk to 
assist the Superintendent, unless the number of teachers 
in the county exceeds 85; an assistant superintendent 
may not be employed unless the number of teachers ex- 
ceeds 175. Hence, five counties depend almost entirely 
upon the County Superintendent alone, employing only 
occasional and temporary clerical assistance. Six out 
of the twenty-three have assistant superintendents, and 
supervisors are found in four. In only three counties— 
Baltimore, Frederick, and Allegany—are the offices 
ample and well-equipped; elsewhere space is often 
meagre and equipment usually limited. One-fourth of 
the county superintendents have but one room, often 
a small one at that, which serves alike as a store-house 
for school supplies, as meeting-place for the County 
Board, and as general office. 
Let us now see what happens. The County Superin- 
tendent is, in the first place, the custodian of the records 
of the County Board. He conducts the correspondence 
with district trustees, teachers, patrons, and the general 
public. He arranges the business to be considered at 
the regular monthly or special meetings and keeps min- 
utes of the proceedings. He collects such statistics from 
the schools as are required, answers all inquiries for in- 
formation, and prepares the annual report submitted to 
the State Department of Education. As treasurer he has 
charge of funds varying from $28,000 annually in the 
smallest to $660,000 in the largest county. He receives,
-P-A-G-E-78
    
46 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
and when audited by the Board members pays, all bills; 
keepsallaccounts;purchases, collects, and distributes text- 
books and educational material, and prepares the annual 
budget to be presented to the county commissioners. 
For lack of assistance and of facilities, clerical work 
is too often poorly performed. In seven or eight coun- 
ties at most—Baltimore, Allegany, Frederick, Harford, 
Washington, Wicomico, Talbot, and Queen Anne’s— 
order prevails. In half a dozen more the work is fairly 
well done. Elsewhere there is a total lack of system. 
Teachers’ examination records are indeed preserved, 
but they are inaccessible; school reports are merely 
bundled together and filed, little use being made of them, 
and data are almost never collected as to why children 
do not receive promotion or why they attend school 
irregularly. The financial accounts, however, be it 
said, while frequently handled in an unbusinesslike man- 
ner, are nevertheless carefully and accurately kept. 
The more purely educational duties begin with main- 
tenance of the school plant. In the smallest county of 
the state—Calvert—the County Superintendent must 
supervise 54 buildings, scattered over 216 miles of terri- 
tory, and in the largest (Baltimore) 181, scattered over 
an area of 650 square miles. District trustees, being 
the immediate custodians of their respective school- 
houses, may spend on their own authority upon upkeep 
and repairs $5 in any one term; larger expenditures can 
be made only after authorization by the County Board. 
Hence, anything costing more than five dollars—whether

a new fence, the grading of the school grounds, the re- 
pair of an outhouse, the roofing or painting of the school- 
house, a new stove or new furniture, is referred to the 
County School Board, and the duty of attending to such 
matters devolves upon the County Superintendent, who 
investigates and reports upon the need, makes the 
necessary purchases, and supervises work done under 
contract. If a new building is to be erected the County 
Superintendent bears the burden of acquiring the 
ground, drawing the plan, letting the contract, and look- 
ing after the construction and equipment. 
Here, then, is a second field of operations, much more 
technical in character, and sufficiently extensive to con- 
sume almost all the County Superintendent’s time and 
energy. With what results? It was stated in the pre- 
ceding chapter that neither the state nor the county 
pursued or could, with its present staff, pursue a definite 
and intelligent policy in regard to new school buildings. 
With respect to sanitation and hygiene there is not 
lacking evidence that recent agitation has had a bene- 
ficial effect. School grounds have here and there been 
cleared of underbrush, outhouses have been cleaned and 
whitewashed, and old buildings have been repaired, 
painted, and redecorated. Nevertheless, it remains true 
that a thoroughly decent and comfortable rural school 
plant, consisting of a neat school building, a clean yard, 
and sanitary outhouses is exceptional. There are in the 
state 1,935 school buildings for white children, 550 for 
colored. In the course of this investigation 500 of the
-P-A-G-E-82
  48 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
former were visited, 50 of the latter. Perhaps 8 per 
cent. of those visited may be called satisfactory. 
The duties thus far considered—those of the Secretary 
and Treasurer of the County Board and those of the cus- 
todian of the school plant, consume at least three-fourths 
of the time of the majority of the county superintendents 
and not less than half of the time of the others. More- 
over, if the school plant is to be kept in proper order, this 
drain will increase rather than diminish. In the smaller 
counties relief can be furnished by providing clerical 
assistance in the office and a reliable, all-round mechanic 
for the field. The larger counties might well follow the 
example of the cities, that is, employ a secretary-treasurer 
to care for the clerical work and the accounts of the 
Board, a business manager to look after the physical side 
of the schools, and a Superintendent, directly responsible 
for the secretary-treasurer and the business manager, 
yet free to devote his major energies to the educational 
conduct of the system. 
Important as are good records and neat schoolhouses, 
the really significant duties of the County Superintend- 
ent are educational. One-half the teachers in the rural 
schools enter the service by way of the county examina- 
tions which he conducts. Do these examinations select 
the best talent available? Do they direct the candidate’s 
attention in the right direction? 
How could they? How can an untrained County 
Superintendent examine sensibly and judiciously the 
candidates for teaching positions? How can an un-

THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT . 49 
trained County Superintendent indicate by the character 
of the examination the line of preparation which pros- 
pective teachers should follow? The situation, be it 
granted, is not easy. Salaries are low—ranging from an 
average of $271 a year in St. Mary’s to $662 a year in 
Baltimore County. Three counties pay an average of 
less than $300; four less than $350; seven less than 
$400; seven less than $450; and only two, Allegany and 
Baltimore, pay in excess of $450. In counties with few 
or poor high schools the probable candidates will be the - 
abler boys and girls who have lingered an extra year in 
the grades or in the rural schools; high school graduates 
will be applicants only in counties well supplied with 
secondary school facilities. But these inherent difficul- 
ties make it all the more important that the County 
Superintendent should be able, by reason of his training 
and experience, to make the best of a bad situation. The 
untrained official does not and cannot do this. 
He fails also, and for the same reason, to use such 
opportunities as he possesses for the improvement of his 
teaching corps. Teacher certificates issued by the County 
Superintendent on the basis of the examinations just dis- 
cussed are, in the first instance, probationary, good for 
only six months. At the end of this period the County 
Superintendent may cancel the certificate, require an- 
other examination, or issue, in lieu of the probationary 
certificate, one valid for five years. The discretion of 
the County Superintendent in respect to the re- 
examination of teachers thus gives him the power to in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    
50 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
sist upon further professional preparation. He possesses 
also an even more potent instrument. The minimum 
salary law of 1910 guaranteed to teachers ranked by the 
County Superintendent as first class a higher minimum 
wage than was provided for other teachers. Thus a 
positive financial inducement was offered to all teachers 
to improve themselves. Wherever county superintend- 
ents have dared to use their legitimate authority the 
effect has been excellent. The enrolment in the Mary- 
land Teachers’ Reading Circle has increased, the Teach- 
ers’ Institute and Teachers’ Meetings have been taken 
more seriously, and teachers in larger numbers have at 
their own expense attended the summer session of nor- 
mal schools and colleges. 
Unfortunately, however, very few county superin- 
tendents have acted. The holder of the probationary 
certificate is seldom dropped and only occasionally re- 
examined. The salary bonus is also usually’ wasted. 
Partly because of the lack of professional ideals, partly 
because of the generally low salary scale, superintendents 
commonly award the salary increase to teachers of long 
service and local favor instead of using it as a lever to 
lift the profession. On the whole, therefore, it is fair 
to say that the County Superintendent usually leaves the 
teaching profession just about where he finds it. 
The teacher is the first—and the most important— 
factor in securing good teaching. The second is supervi- 
sion. The teachers of a school or of a school system are 
molded into an efficient team animated by one purpose

and working toward a common end very largely by the 
pressure, guidance, and inspiration of the supervisors. 
It is one of the advantages of large cities that supervision 
is easily provided; it is among the most serious flaws in 
the district system that supervision is well-nigh impossi- 
ble. Maryland’s county educational organization fa- 
cilitates effective supervision, embracing town and 
country schools alike. For the area is large, the schools 
varied in type, the financial resources more or less sub- 
stantial, and the authority of the County Board unques- 
tioned. But even a trained Superintendent cannot, in 
addition to his other duties, take upon himself, except 
in the very smallest counties, the details of classroom 
supervision. He requires for this purpose a small but 
highly specialized staff. 
Once more, the possibilities of the situation are in this 
matter almost entirely unrealized. Supervisors, includ- 
ing assistant superintendents, are employed in only 
7 of the 23 counties'; and of the assistant superintendents, 
two, perhaps one might say three, are engaged in clerical 
work. To be sure, in addition to these 7 counties, one 
county uses a portion of the state appropriation for 
Colored Industrial Schools to employ a part-time super- 
visor? and another is making a limited use of high school 
teachers* for the same purpose. In short, the teachers

of 16 out of the 23 counties receive no supervisory as- 
sistance other than that given by the County Superin- 
tendent, and but three counties, Allegany, Baltimore, 
and Frederick have anything like an adequate super- 
visory force. The failure to provide adequate super- 
vision is attributed by the county boards to the lack of 
funds. Tootrue. But lack of funds is not fundamental. 
At bottom lack of supervision is due in most counties, 
not so much to financial inability, as to a lack of appre- 
ciation of the significance of efficient supervision on the 
part of the Board and of the Superintendent who has 
failed to lead the Board. 
Of the three counties above mentioned Baltimore 
County must be singled out for especial commendation. 
The County Superintendent is a man of experience and 
modern training; and he is aided by a corps of supervisors, 
including an assistant superintendent, a primary super- 
visor with an assistant, a grammar grade supervisor 
with an assistant, a manual training supervisor, a domes- 
tic science supervisor, and, finally, a supervisor of rural 
schools. Working as a team, they have not only im- 
proved the schools, they have also developed a public 
sentiment which demands increasingly better schools, 
better instruction, better trained and better paid teach- 
ers. The teaching body of the county is permeated by 
genuine enthusiasm. Every improvement effected makes 
itself felt practically throughout the county. The situ- 
ation is, of course, still far from homogeneous, but it is 
developing steadily in the right direction. What Balti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 53 
more County has accomplished cannot be literally dupli- 
cated in counties with more limited resources. But 
every county in Maryland could, up to the limits of 
its financial ability, do the kind of thing that Baltimore 
County does. At bottom it depends on the competency 
of the County Superintendent. 
In counties without supervisors, whatever there is:of 
personal supervision depends upon the county superin- 
tendents who are required by law to visit the schools. 
But the number of reported visits is no index to the 
amount of effective supervision performed. These visits 
are usually brief and of a business or inspectorial char- 
acter. The Superintendent calls to look after the 
physical plant or to classify a teacher on the basis of a 
hasty inspection. This is not “supervision” in the 
sense which the term bears in these pages. 
The County Superintendent also comes into touch 
with the teaching force at the teachers’ meetings and 
conferences held throughout the state at least quarterly. 
Here again one notices the difference between counties 
lacking and counties possessing proper supervision. In 
the former the occasion is apt to be devoted to generali- 
ties—to the discussion of plans or to exhortations on 
general lines. In the supervised counties the confer- 
ences between Superintendent, supervisory staff, and 
teaching body are of an intensive character. Definite 
problems are formulated and presented. A lesson 
actually given by way of illustrating the use of materials 
and methods of presentation is made the basis of dis-
-P-A-G-E-90
  
54 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
cussion. Or the teachers are divided into groups accord- 
ing as they teach in rural or urban schools, in the lower 
or in the upper grades, and attention is centred upon 
questionsof interest to particular groups. With one group 
it may be discipline, with another how to teach beginners 
reading, and with still another what arithmetic should 
be taught. The County Superintendent can thus em- 
ploy the strong teachers to strengthen the weak. The 
entire body is in this way professionalized. But, obvi- 
ously, such organization and endeavor presuppose a 
trained leader and a trained staff. 
In still another important respect is the County Super- 
intendent charged with direct responsibility for the work 
of the classroom. He is required by law to prepare semi- 
annual examination questions for all the schools of the 
county, the second, or June examination, serving as the 
basis of promotion. Now examinations may serve 
several purposes: they may, for instance, ascertain what 
children know and how freely they can use their knowl- 
edge; but their main function is to guide the teacher; 
for by the examinations he sets, the County Superin- 
tendent tells the teacher the kind of instruction she should 
give, the things she should emphasize, and the habits of 
thought and action in which children should be trained. 
As one would expect from our account of the quali- 
fications and resources of the county superintendents, 
the current examinations belong in most counties to an 
obsolete type. By demanding from children isolated and 
unrelated facts and meaningless definitions, they do in-

THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 55 
calculable harm to instruction. As the child’s failure or 
promotion depends upon them, even teachers capable 
of something better are forced to defer to them. They 
must, therefore, rush their pupils in the most superficial 
manner over the assignment for the year, in order to 
have three and even four months free for the reviews 
necessary for the June examination. It is indeed not 
uncommon for teachers to give children the task of find- 
ing the answers to sets of examination questions running 
back for years and to have them write out these answers 
and commit them to memory, as an effective preparation 
for the coming tests! 
A single topic remains to be briefly considered before 
this chapter can be brought to a close. The law re- 
quires the preparation and publication annually of a 
county school report, exhibiting the financial transac- 
tions of the Board and containing data bearing on enrol- 
ment, attendance, etc. The county report might be an 
attractive document, serving as a means of communica- 
tion between the Board and the community. It might 
depict conditions, record progress, explain policy, and 
stimulate interest. It does, as a rule, nothing of the 
sort. The county reports are usually in Maryland—as 
elsewhere—dull pamphlets throwing little light on educa- 
tional problems. 
In the course of our description and criticism of the 
County Superintendent the needs of the situation have 
been clearly implied. Effective schools require skilled 
and specialized leadership. Maryland must define in the
-P-A-G-E-94
  
56 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
statute the qualifications of the County Superintendent. 
It must go into the open market to get him. Having 
found him, the county must give him a decent salary,’ 
assured tenure, and at least a minimum of clerical and 
professional help.

  VI. THE TEACHERS 
ents and supervisors, all have their part to play 
in education; but they strive to little purpose, 
except through well-trained and carefully selected teach- 
ers. Disregarding, for the moment, the influence of 
adequate supervision, the efficiency of the schools de- 
pends upon the preparation of the teachers and upon the 
intelligence with which teachers are chosen. There are 
reasons for exercising unusual watchfulness in Maryland, 
for the law guarantees what is tantamount to unlimited 
tenure. Once appointed, removal is in practice rare. 
What safeguards may an American state wisely set 
up in respect to the training and selection of its teaching 
body? The problem is by no means a simple one. The 
public school system consists of schools of many types— 
urban elementary schools, rural elementary schools, in- 
dustrial schools, and high schoois. One sort of teacher 
is needed for the graded city school; a modified type is 
needed for the ungraded rural school. The teacher of 
high school Latin needs a different equipment from the 
teacher of high school physics; the teacher of high school 
physics needs a different preparation from that of the 
teacher of industrial art or domestic science in elementary 
57 Bee« whether state or county, superintend-

58 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
or high schools. Differentiation of function thus requires 
within limits specialization in training. We say ad- 
visedly “within limits,’ for all teachers of a given 
rank ought to base their professional training on a cer- 
tain common educational background or experience. 
All teachers in the elementary schools, city or country, 
should possess something like a high school education fol- 
lowed by normal school training; all high school teachers 
—certainly in the usual branches, should possess a higher 
education. Otherwise, the teaching force will be little 
above the level to which it hopes to elevate the pupils! 
Exceptions do indeed occur. There are some good teach- 
ers who have received little training and some poor teach- 
ers who have received much. But public school systems 
that turn the exception into the rule make precisely the 
showing that, as we shall now see, is made by Maryland. 
There are in Maryland, exclusive of Baltimore, 3,467 
white and 672 colored teachers. Accurate information 
was obtained as to the professional training of 3,338 white 
teachers (96 per cent. of the whole) and 505 colored 
teachers (75 per cent. of the whole) both before and 
after they entered the profession. Regarding the train- 
ing of these teachers, no general statement can be made 
at all. There are the widest possible variations in the 
training of teachers doing the same grade of work—incon- 
ceivable confusion and lack of sequence and order in their 
preparation. For example, some teachers had entered 
the normal schools after high school graduation, as they 
should; but someof themhad enteredfrom the first, second,

from the elementary schools. Some went from the ele- 
mentary schools to college in order to study “‘education”’; 
others spent a year or two in a normal school and then

entered college; still others reversed this last-mentioned 
process! There is no rhyme or reason in what has been 
taking place. Of over 3,000 white elementary teachers 
in the state outside of Baltimore (Fig. 1) 391 (12.7 per 
cent.) have had only an elementary school education;

year high school course; only 148—less than 5 per cent. 
of the whole—have received a standard normal school 
training. Of the rest, some have spent a little while in 
normal school; some have received an irregular normal 
schooling; a few have been to college and still fewer 
through college. Grouping together standard normal 
school, part college, and college graduates, about 10 per 
cent. of the elementary teachers of Maryland—not more 
—may be called well trained; not quite one-third could 
on a stretch be called fairly well trained; at least one- 
third are practically untrained. The body as a whole is 
thus heterogeneous to the last degree.2 How could 
it possibly function as a unit in carrying out a well- 
conceived educational policy, even if there were one??

*To say nothing of classes prior to 1910, of the last six graduating classes 
of the Maryland State Normal Schools, less than 4o per cent. entered 
from standard high schools.

The colored elementary teachers, including the super- 
visors, make a better showing than might have been 
anticipated. (Fig. 2.) Eight per cent. appear to have 
received a standard normal training. In view of the 
fact that there is not a single colored high school in the 
state outside of the city of Baltimore and the local 
facilities for training colored teachers are extremely 
meagre, this is a surprising fact... To some extent it may 
be accounted for on the ground that, while the returns 
for the white teachers are practically complete, reports 
were received from only three-fourths of the colored 
teachers. This was not due to negligence on the part of 
the county superintendents, but to the fact that many 
colored schools had closed for the year before the blanks 
calling for data on teacher preparation were received, 
making it impossible to secure the requested information. 
Complete returns from the colored teachers would prob- 
ably lessen the per cent. of those adequately trained.

than 1o per cent. of the special high school teachers 
now in service are well trained. Forty per cent. have 
had a normal school or a part college course, but a fourth 
have never gone beyond the high school itself. To be 
sure, these high school graduates have had in most cases 
the special high school course in manual training or 
domestic science, or the commercial branches, but such 
instruction hardly gives them the broad outlook upon 
life and industry which is essential to efficient work in 
their chosen fields. 
A fair degree of uniformity in the teaching body can be 
obtained only if admission thereto is controlled by a 
centralagency. Maryland, instead of a single portal, has 
almost half a dozen: the county examination, normal 
school diplomas, college certificates, and other evidences 
of training. No one authority passes upon these diverse 
credentials. In consequence, there is no common stand- 
ard and no way of enforcing a common standard, if one 
were formulated. 
As has been intimated in the preceding chapter, the 
teachers’ examinations conducted by county superin- 
tendents form the most objectionable feature of the exist- 
ing situation. We have called attention to the fact that 
untrained superintendents cannot conduct judicious ex- 
aminations. Asa matter of fact, under the existing law, 
neither can highly trained county superintendents. For 
the subjects of the examinations are regulated by stat- 
utes that make a sensible examination practically im- 
possible.
-P-A-G-E-108
  66 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
These statutes go back to the period between 1866 and 
1872, when the conception of a free public school system 
was just beginning to be formed. The pioneers in this 
field were men of vision who planned a program of in- 
struction unrealized even at the present time. Their 
ambitious ideas were embodied in the law of 1872, which 
prescribed that there “shall be taught in every district 
school, orthography, reading, writing, English grammar, 
geography, arithmetic, history of the United States, good 
behavior, algebra, bookkeeping, natural philosophy, the 
Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the 
State of Maryland, the history of Maryland, vocal music, 
drawing, physiology, the laws of health, and domestic 
economy.” It was also provided that, in communities 
having a considerable German population, the German 
language might also be introduced. Nor was this pre- 
tentious program distributed between elementary and 
high schools; on the contrary, it was part of the dream 
that all branches should be taught in every district 
school. 
Teachers were to be selected on the basis of their fit- 
ness to carry out this ambitious scheme. To be sure, 
two grades of certificates were recognized. The second 
or lower grade—regarded as a makeshift then, though 
to-day, half a century later, it is still the prevailing cer- 
tificate—called for an examination in spelling, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and 
history only; the first-grade certificate involved an exam- 
ination in all the studies mentioned in the law, except
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE TEACHERS 67 
physiology, vocal music, drawing, laws of health, and 
domestic economy. There was thus a close correspond- 
ence between the visionary course of study meant for 
every district school and the examination required for a 
first-grade certificate. 
Despite the vision, however, the actual instruction in 
the one-room rural and village schools was practically 
limited to the so-called three R’s, English grammar, 
geography, and history. Branches like bookkeeping, 
algebra, and natural philosophy were attempted as a rule 
only in the academies and in the high schools of the 
larger towns, and the number of pupils taking them was 
small. For example, as late as 1900 Howard County 
reported only 134 pupils in all the schools of the county 
above the sixth grade; of these 68 were in bookkeeping, 
123 in algebra, and 56 in natural philosophy. But the 
academies and high schools did not confine themselves 
to the studies prescribed in the law. Latin and higher 
mathematics including geometry, trigonometry, and sur- 
veying formed the backbone of their instruction; a little 
English literature and a smattering of the more exact 
sciences such as astronomy were also taught. 
Prospective teachers had therefore under the law to 
be trained to teach a course of study which as a matter of 
fact had no existence in either elementary or high schools. 
Hence examination based on the statutory requirement 
did not test the qualifications of teachers to give instruc- 
tion in the subjects actually taught. Those who strove 
to obtain the first-grade certificate as a basis of teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  68 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
in elementary schools were compelled to equip them- 
selves in algebra, natural philosophy, and the like, but 
not in such elementary school branches as physiology, 
the laws of health, vocal music, drawing, and domestic 
economy. Those who strove to obtain a first-grade 
certificate in order to teach in the high school were even 
more remote from their needs, for they took no examina- 
tion in Latin, higher mathematics, English literature, 
general history, or in any of the sciences other than nat- 
ural philosophy. In a word, the examination for the 
standard certificate of the day was a poor basis for select- 
ing teachers for the elementary schools and of little or no 
worth in the selection of high school teachers. Incredible 
as it may seem, these defects, dating back to the year 
1872, persist to this very day. Indeed, despite the 
differentiation made in recent years between elementary 
schools and high schools, the examination system of 1872 
lasted up to 1904 without a single statutory change. 
At that time, without cutting anything out, there were 
added to the examination subjects for the second-grade 
certificate the history of Maryland, the State and Na- 
tional Constitution, physiology, algebra to quadratics, 
the theory and practice of teaching, and the laws and 
the by-laws of the public schools. Young women who 
teach in the elementary rural schools are thus examined 
in algebra, which they do not teach, but not in drawing 
or agriculture which they are expected to teach. Mean- 
while, candidates for the first-grade certificate are tested 
in bookkeeping, algebra, and natural philosophy, subjects
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE TEACHERS 69 
long since dropped from the elementary schools, and in 
general history and plane geometry which are distinctly 
high school studies, while they go entirely unexamined in 
important elementary branches. Equally disastrous is 
the effect of this arrangement on the high school. For as 
the first-grade certificate qualifies for a high school post, 
instruction may be given in Latin, higher mathematics, 
English literature, or science by a person holding a teach- 
ing license issued absolutely without reference to them. 
No serious effort has yet been made to get rid of the 
absurdities which we have just pointed out. The state 
has limited its endeavors to encouraging improvement in 
ways that, helpful though they be, do not strike at the 
root of the problem. A succession of laws beginning in 
1867 has aimed to encourage and develop the county 
institute; in 1914 counties were authorized, in lieu of 
holding the annual institute, to require not less than a 
fourth of their teachers to attend a summer school; and 
in the same year, the payment of higher salaries to teach- 
ers of superior training or ability was also authorized. 
Such provisions are wise enough in their way for they 
tend to improve the existing teaching corps. But much 
more radical measures must be taken. 
At the outset a clear division must be made between 
certificates valid in the elementary school and those 
valid in the high school. On the side of the elementary 
school an examination should be devised which will test 
the fitness not in some, but in all, the branches included 
in the elementary course of study. On the side of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  
7° PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
high school there will need to be such a grouping of the | 
principal academic studies that no teacher will be per- 
mitted to teach a branch unless she has first proven her 
fitness. In order that uniformity of standard may be se- 
cured, these examinations should be conducted by the 
state department, acting through the County Super- 
intendent. From an eligible list thus formed, teachers 
should be appointed by the County Superintendent—no 
longer as now by the county boards and the district 
trustees. 
In bringing about this reorganization an important 
factor will be the normal schools of the state, to the con- 
sideration of which we now turn. 
Maryland supports two establishments for the training 
of white elementary school teachers—the Normal School 
at Frostburg and the new Normal School at Towson. 
The Frostburg School, established in 1897, remains 
without any clear function in the state school system. 
Provision for it has always been grudging. The present 
plant comprises a modest building capable of accommo- 
dating about 175 students with additional quarters for a 
small practice school. The equipment is poor and alto- 
gether inadequate for instruction in nature study, physics, 
chemistry, manual training, domestic science, and the 
fine arts. The total amount provided annually by the 
state for all expenses from 1902 to 1914 was $7,000; in 
1914 the sum was raised to $10,000. Accordingly, the 
salaries of the instructors scarcely exceed those in the 
neighboring high schools, and are in any case too meagre
-P-A-G-E-113
  
THE TEACHERS 71 
to procure a qualified staff. Nevertheless, the school has 
grown rapidly, having in 1914 an enrolment of 102 pre- 
paratory and 61 normal students, a total of 163, mostly 
drawn from Allegany County. Including the class of 
1914, 156 students have completed the course, of whom 
131 are now engaged in teaching. 
The institution destined to be made the central normal 
school is the Baltimore Normal, established in 1865. 
The building occupied from the early 70’s until the pres- 
ent autumn was for years one of the best of its kind in the 
country, and even at the time of its abandonment was not 
altogether unadapted to its purposes. While thus fairly 
well housed the funds for its support have never been 
adequate. Prior to 1914 the regular annual appropria- 
tion did not exceed $20,000, and it is now only $50,000. 
For almost forty years the Baltimore Normal was the 
only school for the training of teachers supported and con- 
trolled by the state. Its graduates, representing all 
sections and numbering more than 2,500, are to be found 
in important positions both within and without the 
schools. The school has, however, operated on so inade- 
quate an allowance that at best it has accomplished only 
a part of what it might have accomplished. Its leader- 
ship has at times been distinctly inadequate; not infre- 
quently, lacking funds to employ trained and experienced 
teachers, the school has appointed to its staff its own re- 
cent graduates. Inbreeding has thus gone on with its 
usual bad effects. 
Our interest is, however, with the future, not with the
-P-A-G-E-114
  72 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
past, of the Baltimore Normal School. The school has 
just occupied its new quarters at Towson, with dormitory 
accommodations for two hundred students, classrooms, 
laboratory, library, and gymnasium facilities for six or 
seven hundred, and ample quarters for an adequate prac- 
tice school. If the state is to derive full returns from the 
enormous sum now invested in its plant and equipment, a 
thoroughgoing reorganization is needed. 
We make this suggestion in no spirit of fault-finding 
with those who have hitherto had to conduct the school 
on a quite insufficient allowance. It may well be that 
no one could have done better under the circumstances. 
But the new plant totally changes conditions. Its facil- 
ities are perhaps not surpassed anywhere; and an ade- 
quate budget will doubtless be provided. Under these 
circumstances the head of the school ought to be the 
most competent that the country affords; and the entire 
country should be searched in order to find him. Poli- 
tics, personal interest, and local pride must be eliminated, 
for upon this selection depends in great part the progress 
of the public schools of the entire state. In the same 
way such men and women should be selected as teachers, 
in charge of the different departments, as will not only be 
able to develop strong courses of instruction within the 
school, but also to exert an influence throughout the 
state. For there is need not only of. capable instructors, 
but of organizers who can work with the teachers in the 
field, inspiring and directing them in their daily work. 
The activities of the old school stopped with the close
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE TEACHERS 73 
of the school year in June. The work of a progressive 
school that would fully occupy its field, and especially a 
normal school, is.never done. Indeed, the summer sea- 
son offers a great opportunity to the Baltimore Normal, 
if it is to rise to the new and larger service before it. 
Over 75 per cent. of the elementary teachers outside 
of the city of Baltimore, when judged most liberally, 
have had less than a standard professional preparation; 
to add to the initial equipment of these ill-prepared 
teachers should become one of the primary objects of the 
institution. To this end there should be a summer 
session, and the work of the summer session should equal 
in strength and attractiveness that of the regular school 
year. 
Again, the entrance standards of the old school have 
always been low. For years young people taken from 
the highest grade of the elementary school were gradu- 
ated in three years; only since 1904 has the course run 
four years, divided equally between preparatory and 
professional work. By resolution of the State Board of 
Education the admission requirements for 1915 were fixed 
at the completion of the second year of high school, but 
no steps were taken to readjust the old two-year prepara- 
tory course. 
While more high school graduates entered in the fall of 
1915 than ever before, a great part of the work of the 
school is still confined, as it always has been, to prepara- 
tory students. Surely the time is now at hand when the 
school should cease to build its professional work upon an
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  74 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
abbreviated high school course. This does not imply 
that the present work below the professional course should 
be summarily abandoned. There are, and for some time 
there will continue to be, sections without high schools 
in easy reach of ambitious young people. To accommo- 
date students thus located who desire to become teachers 
the high school course at the Baltimore Normal should be 
maintained; but it should be lengthened to full four years, 
and so strengthened that it will become one of the strong- 
est in the state, instead of being a mere subterfuge and 
makeshift. 
It has been urged that the present is an appropriate 
time to broaden the activities of the Baltimore Normal 
so as to include the preparation of secondary teachers. 
Even if the state were not pledged to another policy, it 
is our opinion that this central school should confine its 
attention solely to the training of elementary teachers. 
The number of secondary teachers needed annually is 
too small for the state to undertake to develop, in com- 
petition with colleges already in the field, strong courses 
for regular high school teachers. There are, however, 
two kinds of high school teacher—viz., teachers of 
domestic science and of manual training—for the train- 
ing of whom no other schools in Maryland are at all 
equipped, and with these the Normal might wisely deal. 
The suggestion that it should also train supervisors is, 
in our judgment, without value. The number of new 
supervisors annually needed is inconsiderable. To pro- 
vide proper facilities could only be done at excessive cost.
-P-A-G-E-117
     THE TEACHERS 75 
The state should indeed maintain a high standard in 
appointing supervisors, but it should expect supervisors to 
resort to special institutions for supplementary training. 
The Towson plant was created on the theory that the 
training of all the elementary teachers for the white 
schools might be there concentrated. In 1914 the total en- 
rolment of both the Baltimore and the Frostburg schools 
was 224; there were 101 graduates. To supply all thenew 
elementary teachers needed in the state an enrolment 
of more than 600 and yearly graduates in excess of 300 
are required, or an increase in enrolment and graduates of 
more than 200 per cent. It is necessary, therefore, to 
attract students in larger numbers and to hold them until 
they complete the course. But a difficulty arises. 
Two-thirds of the teachers of Maryland work in vil- 
lages and the open country; 40 per cent. of them have 
one-room schools. Will the graduates of this stately 
normal school be willing to teach in rural schools? Will 
the practice school at Towson reproduce even approxi- 
mately the conditions which most of its graduates may 
have tomeet? How can courses and practice opportuni- 
ties be adjusted to rural needs? American experience is 
not wholly encouraging in this matter. Central normal 
schools do not readily represent the rural point of view; 
and teachers trained in them prefer town and city posts. 
For this reason many states are endeavoring to train 
teachers for the rural elementary schools in connection 
with county high schools; and the legislature of Mary- 
land passed in 1914 a permissive law looking to this end. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  
76 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
For the moment, however, it will probably be wisest 
to take no steps in this direction until the Towson school 
has had a fair chance to grapple with the problem.! 
There are now 672 colored teachers in the schools out- 
side of the city of Baltimore. To encourage their fur- 
ther preparation—less than 40 per cent. of whom can be 
credited with anything like a satisfactory training—and 
toprepare approximately 75 new colored teachers required 
annually, the state maintains a single institution, the 
Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie, 
opened under the auspices of the State Board of Educa- 
tion, September, 1911. 
The equipment comprises a farm of 187 acres, an ordi- 
nary eight-room school building, the attic story of which 
serves for a girls’ dormitory, the first and second floors 
for classrooms and the principal’s office, and the base- 
ment for kitchen and dining-room. A remodelled barn 
answers for a dormitory for boys, and there is also an old 
farmhouse used principally for storage. The present 
annual appropriation for maintenance is $7,000, and 
there are accommodations for about 70 students. 
The course for teachers is three years in length, with an 
entrance requirement equivalent to the sixth grade of the 
public school. So many students, however, offered them- 
selves, whose preparation fell below this standard, that a 
two-year preparatory course had to be added. The 
1This delay will be of advantage for another reason. The General 
Education Board is just beginning a thorough study of the training of 
rural teachers in Minnesota and other states. The results will probably 
be available within a year.
-P-A-G-E-119
THE TEACHERS 7 
enrolment in the normal course in 1913-1914 was 43, with 
one special student, and in the preparatory department, 
28, making a total of 72—an enrolment which taxes the 
accommodations to the limit. 
The management of the school is excellent. The 
principal and his assistant are at once competent and 
“rural-minded.” An abandoned farm was part of the 
school property. As school and students were both 
needy, principal and students set to work to make the 
farm supply what they lacked. The result has been 
gratifying from every point of view. Supplies have been 
raised, because there was no money with which to buy 
them; in the process agriculture has been efficiently 
taught, and rural school teachers of the right type have 
been trained. Up to date, however, the graduates num- 
ber only 25, and not all of these have become teachers. 
The Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie 
is, to be sure, not the only source of colored teachers: 
Hampton, Tuskegee, Cheney Normal School, Dover 
College, and others contribute; some are also obtained 
from the Washington High School, and from the Balti- 
more High School and Morgan College. Nevertheless, 
half of the colored teachers of the state have no certifi- 
cates other than ‘‘postal card certificates’”’—that is, they 
are permitted to teach without having passed any exam- 
ination at all, the county superintendents selecting those 
most likely to succeed, irrespective of academic and pro- 
fessional credentials. 
The only other institution within the state, besides the
-P-A-G-E-120
  78 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
Maryland Normal and Industrial School and the Balti- 
more High School, that attempts to prepare elementary 
colored teachers, is the Princess Anne Academy, under 
the management of the Morgan College Corporation. 
This school has a good-sized farm and rather ample quar- 
ters and equipment. While it is essentially a prepara- 
tory school for Morgan College, yet the employment of 
Federal funds has made agriculture and agricultural 
pursuits prominent and given to the school an industrial 
atmosphere. Special attention has lately been given to 
the preparation of teachers. Besides regular courses 
during the year, a summer school with an enrolment of 
about 40 was conducted in 1915. The school is located 
near the colored population centre of the Eastern Shore, 
readily accessible, and is in position to exert a good influ- 
ence upon the public schools of that section. 
This brief statement will show that Maryland’s present 
facilities for training negro teachers are altogether inade- 
quate, even though we reckon, as an additional factor, 
the industrial schools supported in 16 counties at an 
annual cost to the state of $22,500. There is, therefore, 
every reason why the school at Bowie should be developed 
and made the centre for the training of colored teachers 
for at least the Western Shore, if not for the entire state. 
To do this its facilities will need to be largely increased 
and the teaching staff developed, so that it will be in 
position to give instruction to larger numbers of prospec- 
tive teachers during the year and to offer helpful work 
during the summer to those now in service.
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE TEACHERS 79 
But the development of the school at Bowie alone will 
not be sufficient. Maryland would do well to follow the 
example of Virginia and other Southern States in the 
establishment of County Training Schools—schools 
which, while giving appropriate instruction of a secondary 
grade, will also provide for a certain amount of teacher 
training. In this way a gradually improved teaching 
force, particularly for the rural schools, can be built up. 
Our position regarding the teachers of Maryland may 
then be briefly summarized. The profession is without 
standards, without even the possibility of standards. 
Some form of central control must be instituted; teachers 
must be differentiated on the basis of their particular 
functions; and appointments must be made by the 
County Superintendent, who, under the new order, will 
necessarily be a trained officer. Meanwhile, the reorgan- 
ized normal schools of the state, codperating with the re- 
organized county school organization, should prove an 
important influence in improving teachers now in service.   
     
-P-A-G-E-122

cates its children and what measures it must take 
to improve educational facilities, we have thus far 
discussed the administrative organization, state and 
county, and the character and qualifications of the super- 
vising and teaching bodies. We have criticised the 
county boards as politically constituted, the county 
superintendents as lacking in technical training and 
stability of tenure, the teaching body as ill-prepared and 
heterogeneous. Exceptions have indeed been gladly 
noted. A few county boards are non-political; a few 
county superintendents are competent and secure; some 
teachers—indeed, not a few—are well-trained, intelligent, 
and progressive. Nevertheless, these exceptions, impor- 
tant as they are, do not really leaven the mass. 
Whether or not the organization which we have thus de- 
scribed does the best that it is capable of doing depends on 
two factors to the consideration of which we now turn, viz.: 
(x) the regularity with which children attend school, and 
(2) the course of instruction through which they are put. 
To the former topic the present chapter will be devoted. 
The legal school age in Maryland is from five to twenty 
years of age. But children will neither start to school 
80 [: THE effort to ascertain how well Maryland edu-

  ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 81 
at five nor remain until they are twenty. It would there- 
fore be absurd to criticise enrolment and attendance on 
the basis of the statutory requirement. Itis however fair 
to expect children to begin school at six; and now that high 
schools are developing, it is important to ascertain how 
many pupils remain up to, say, eighteen. Accordingly, 
children from six to eighteen years of age are regarded in 
this chapter as constituting the school population. 
The number of children in Maryland between 6 and 18 
has increased decidedly since 1880. There were 276,229 
children of school age in Maryland in 1880; there were 
339,467 in 1914. Simultaneously, as might be expected, 
the number of children enrolled in schools has also in- 
creased. What is more, the increase in school enrolment 
has been larger than the increase in school population. 
Conditions have therefore improved. (Fig. 4.) In 1880 
FIG. 4

  82 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
only 59 per cent. of the white and colored children be- 
tween 6 and 18 were in school, whereas in 1914, 73 per 
cent. were registered. In a word, in 1880, 41 children 
out of each too that should have been in school were 
not there, while in 1914 only 27 out of each 100 were 
out altogether. (Fig. 5.) Children are, of course, and

have always been, enrolled in other than public schools. 
We have no means of knowing how many attended pri- 
vate and parochial schools in 1880, nor do we know how 
many attend private and parochial schools to-day. There 
can be no doubt, however, that a larger percentage of the 
school population attended public schools in 1914 than 
attended in 1880. Public school enrolment is, however, 
even now less than three-fourths of the school popula- 
tion.

Up to 1900 the situation is partly explained by the 
non-enrolment of large numbers of colored children. 
(Fig. 6.) Since 1900, however, the difference between

the enrolment of colored children and the enrolment of 
white children has become practically negligible. In 
that year there were enrolled 68 per cent. of the white 
as against 66 per cent. of the colored children, and 2 to 3 
per cent. continues to measure the difference. 
Were there an up-to-date and complete school census 
giving the number of children of each age and the number 
at school, it would be possible to determine accurately 
the number of children of each age who are not enrolled. 
Such data are not available, for Maryland does not take 
a state school census. Hence, there is no telling how 
enrolment varies with age. The Federal Census, how-
-P-A-G-E-128
  84 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
ever, throws some light on the question. On the basis 
of its figures for 1910 it appears that, of children between 
6 and 14 years of age, 17 white children out of each 100, 
and 29 colored children out of each roo are not enrolled.

course, in the high school; for 40 per cent. of the white chil-

about between the second and the seventh grades of the 
elementary school,! and the same is true of all the 
colored pupils. These figures may not be absolutely

correct, but they serve to explain why in the Federal

  An efficient system of public schools not only enrolls 
children, but holds at least those who are physically and 
mentally normal until they have finished the elementary, 
if not the high school, course. The school records of 
Maryland are so incomplete that it is impossible to de- 
termine with accuracy the number of grades finished by 
children before they drop out of school. But enough is 
known to show that the situation is deplorably bad. 
Under normal conditions children start to school in their 
seventh year (i. e., when they are six years old) ; therefore, 
if the system is efficient—if, that is, they start to school 
at six and remain consecutively, there ought to be just 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  86 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
aboutas many children in the second classor grade as there 
were in the first. Now in cities having a population of 
2,500 or more, exclusive of Baltimore, there were enrolled 
in the winter term last year 1,916 children from eight 
to nine years of age, and only 1,590 children from six to 
seven years of age.t In other words, about 16 per 
cent. of the children started from one to two years too 
late. In consequence, many of the late beginners will 
drop out of school without completing the elementary 
curriculum; for a late start reduces the number of years 
spent in school and, as a rule, reduces the number of 
grades finished. Efforts must therefore be made to get 
children into school more promptly. 
Once started, the schools, even though there is no 
adequate compulsory attendance law, hold the children 
fairly well until they pass the age of thirteen. The orig- 
inal enrolment of 1,590 rises three years later to 1,930, 
gradually declining until there are 1,598 children in

attendance in their fourteenth year. But these figures 
do not indicate orderly progress through the elementary 
grades. If children started to school when six years 
of age, fourteen-year-old children would normally be 
found in the eighth grade. If they start later than six, 
they will as a rule be correspondingly retarded. Now in 
the cities under consideration, fourteen-year-old children 
(Table VI), instead of being concentrated in the eighth 
grade, are scattered from the first to the eleventh grades: 
five were still in the first grade; 19 had finished the first 
and reached the second; 300 had reached grade seven, 
and 276, grade eight. About two-thirds of the children 
under fourteen years of age—to be precise, 898 out of 
1,358—were from one to seven grades in arrears; 44 per 
cent. had either not reathed or not finished more than 
gradeV; only 13 per cent. were normal or ahead of normal.!

On this showing, probably 50 per cent. of the white 
children of the state, not to mention the colored chil- 
dren, are taking up the duties of life with no more than 
a fourth or a fifth grade education. Very few, indeed, 
go much further. For, of the original enrolment we 
are now considering, the figures show that while 17 
per cent. will leave school before they are fourteen, 50 
per cent. will leave before reaching fifteen, and 80 per 
cent. before reaching eighteen. That is, not more than 
one in five stays long enough to finish the high school, 
and not to exceed three out of ten, even if progress were 
regular, remain long enough to complete the elementary 
school. 
This estimate can be confirmed from another direction. 
Out of the 17,650 children in the schools of the cities in 
the winter term of 1915 (Table VII), only 374, or 2 per 
cent., were ahead of their grade for their age, as compared

to 13,599, or 77 per cent., who were behind their grade.! 
These figures are, of course, not absolutely accurate; but 
the possible error? in them would not greatly modify our 
1Table VII is based on Table V. In Table V the number to the left 
of the block represents the children in the grade under age, the number in 
the block those of normal age, and the number to the right of the block 
those over-age. Over-age in this case is judged from the point of view 
of entering the grade, 6 up to 7 being taken as the normal age for begin- 
ning the first grade, 7 up to 8 for the second grade, and soon. On this 
basis a child should enter the eighth grade between 13 and up to 14 and 
complete an eighth-grade course by 15. 
The ages of the children are those of their last birthday, and not, as 
they should be, when over-age is judged from entering the grade in a 
system having annual promotion, as of the beginning of the official school 
year. What difference in the amount of over-age reported, this differ- 
ence in the time of taking the ages of the children makes, it is impossible 
to say, but in all probability it is very small. Again, the ages of the 
children are those recorded in the school records by the teachers as given 
by the children themselves. No documentary evidence of age is re- 
quired, nor is there any great effort made on the part of the teachers 
to verify the age given. 
Finally, there is one point at issue which makes, according as it is 
settled, a difference of 30 per cent. in the amount of over-age reported. 
There are those who claim that the elementary school course in Mary- 
land is an eight-year course, the additional grade being accounted for by 
the first grade’s covering the work ordinarily done in the first and second 
years. There is nothing in the state course of study to justify this posi- 
tion. Nor is there anything in the first-grade enrolment of the fourteen 
cities from which the data were collected, except at Annapolis, Bruns- 
wick, Cristfield, Hagerstown, and Cumberland. But a study of the 
work of the first grade in at least three of these places reveals on the one 
hand rather more advanced instruction in arithmetic than is ordinarily 
done in the first grade, but shows on the other that reading is on the 
whole under grade. Hence even in the cities having an unusual large 
first-grade enrolment, there is no ground for holding that the first grade 
represents two years of school work. 
*This error may arise from two factors: (1) Children may blunder 
slightly in stating their age; (2) there is some confusion, due to the fact 
that, as the course of study is planned for seven years, it is a question 
whether the first grade does not represent two years’ work. However, 
even were it assumed that the first grade combines two years’ work, 47 
per cent. of the children, above considered, would be over-age—a condi- 
tion scarcely paralleled in any American city in which the problem of 
over-age has been investigated.

verdict. The conditions which they reveal are, to say 
the least, very bad. 
Over-age—i. e., being older than a normal child in a 
given class! should be—is more serious in the upper than 
in the lower grades. For a young child who has fallen 
behind may by working hard catch up with his class. 
If, however, he is in an upper grade, the chances are that, 
should he fall behind, he will drop out of school, instead 
of retrieving the lost ground. In Maryland over-age 
runs straight through the schools. Enormous numbers of 
children of all grades are behind where they ought to be. 
(Fig. 9.) Eighty-five children out of every hundred are 
over-age in the second grade; and 8x out of one hundred

he is six years old and thereafter advances at the rate of one grade every 
year.

in the seventh grade. Conditions are practically as bad 
in the high school, where 76 per cent. are behind in the 
first year, and 7o per cent. in the fourth year of the 
course.! 
As has been already pointed out, over-age almost in- 
evitably results in abbreviating the child’s stay in school. 
This is certainly the case when children are retarded more 
than a year or two. (Fig. 10.) For children who ought 
to finish their elementary schooling at fourteen will not 
remain till they are sixteen or seventeen for that purpose. 
Now the 3,943 children? who are between one and two 
years behind their grade would, if they remain in school 
and advance regularly, be between 16 and 17 when they 
complete the elementary course. Similarly, the 1,058 
who are between three and four years behind their proper 
grade would be between 18 and 19 on completing the 
elementary course of study. Of course children do not

remain in the lower school to any such ages. If they did, 
there would now be about 4,000 children 16 years of age 
or older in the elementary schools of the Maryland towns 
we have been considering; there are, as a matter of fact, 
only 165.1. It is thus evident that probably 98 per cent.

  of the children now behind their grade will drop out be- 
fore completing the course; in all probability they will 
lose just about as many grades as they are now in arrears. 
Our estimate, then, that not to exceed 50 per cent. of the 
white children enrolled in the schools are getting more 
than a fifth-grade education is shown to be well within the 
facts. 
Several factors combine to account for the extent of 
over-age in the Maryland schools. Late entrance is one; 
irregular attendance, another. Children once enrolled 
  
1See Table V, page 86.
-P-A-G-E-139
  
ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 93 
cannot be promoted regularly unless they attend regu- 
larly. It has already been pointed out that the enrol- 
ment falls short of the school population. Attention 
must now be directed to the fact that, of the children who 
are enrolled—children, that is, who propose to attend 
school, only about half attended on the average in 1880; 
since then attendance has steadily improved until in 
1914 the average daily attendance, in so far as the enrol- 
ment is concerned, reached 65.3 per cent. (Fig. 11.) 
FIG. IT 
         
     PER CENT OF ENROLMENT IN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE 
1900 1910 1914 1880 1890 
This is, to be sure, a great improvement from the stand- 
point of 1880; but it is still poor; for it means that of every 
one hundred children enrolled, 34 are now absent daily. 
The plant thus seems to be running at only two-thirds 
capacity. As a matter of fact, it is far from doing even 
this! For attendance should be calculated on the basis 
of school population, not of school enrolment—on the 
basis, that is, of the children who ought to be going to 
school rather than on the basis of those who are really  
-P-A-G-E-140
    94 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
going. Thus considered, the average daily attendance 
was 31 per cent. in 1880—less, that is, than one-third of 
what it should have been; and it was 47.1 per cent. in 
1914—less than one-half of what it should have been. 
The plant is working, therefore, not two-thirds capacity— 
assuming that there are accommodations for all children 
between 6 and 18—but less than one-half capacity. 
(Fig. 12.) Hence the schools are not doing half their job,

In these statements no distinction is made between 
white and colored children. One might suppose that a 
high average attendance among white children is brought 
down by a low average attendance on the part of colored 
children. This is, however, not the case. Colored chil- 
dren do indeed attend school less regularly than white, 
but the difference is not sufficient to account for the bad 
showing. In 1914 the attendance of colored children 
averaged 59 per cent. against 67 per cent. for whites: that
-P-A-G-E-141
  ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 95 
is, 33 white children out of every hundred were missing 
as against 41 colored. (Fig. 13.)

Conditions do, however, vary greatly in the various 
counties. Whether children attend school regularly or not 
depends on several factors—on the attitude of parents, 
on the merits of the schools, on the condition of roads, 
etc. Obviously, sections differ in these respects. (Fig. 
14.) Baltimore County, with a relatively superior school 
system and good physical conditions, leads the white 
schools of the state with an average daily attendance 
of 73 per cent.; St. Mary’s brings up the rear with 55 per 
cent. Even were the white schools of these two counties 
of equal efficiency, Baltimore County gives its children 
a better education with only 27 out of each one hundred 
 
-P-A-G-E-142

absent daily than St. Mary’s gives with 45 absent daily. 
Similar differences are to be observed in the attendance

of colored children. For example, the average number of 
colored children in attendance in 1914 in Worcester 
County was 4o per cent. of the enrolment, whereas 55 
per cent. attended in Wicomico. 
The tabulated records of the county superintendents 
are so lacking in details that a more intensive study of 
attendance cannot be made. There is no way of telling  
-P-A-G-E-143
  
ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 97 
from the reports whether children attend city schools 
more regularly or less regularly than rural schools; 
whether they attend the one-room school more regularly 
or less regularly than the two- or three-room school. For 
the purpose of furnishing an illustration of what should 
and can be always done in this matter, a special investi- 
gation was made in Howard and Queen Anne counties, 
the former located in the central part of the Eastern 
Shore, the latter in the central section of the Western 
Shore! In these counties attendance was poorest in the 
colored schools and best in the city schools (Ellicott 
City and Centerville). (Fig. 15.) The great difficulty

in school during the Winter Term of 1915. In presenting these data, 
attendance is computed upon the basis of the number of days the schools 
were open during the term in question and upon the number of days of 
actual attendance. Ordinarily, attendance is computed upon the basis 
of the days in school after a child once enrolls, no account thus being 
taken of the days lost or the absence due to entering a week or two after 
the opening of the term.

of getting to and from school accounts in part only for 
the lower attendance in the case of the one-room rural 
and village school as compared with the city schools. No 
small part of the difference is doubtless due to lack of 
interest in education on the part of parents. This lack is 
clearly revealed when the difference of age is taken into 
account. For at every age, city children attend more 
regularly than country children. (Fig. 16.) Now, the

  country boy has no pressing work on the farm in winter. 
Differences in physical conditions do not, therefore, 
clearly explain why 86 per cent. of the city children of 13 
attend school as against 63 per cent. of country children; 
or why 88 per cent. of the city children of 14 attend as 
against 56 per cent. of country children. The attitude 
of parents and the quality of the instruction are factors
-P-A-G-E-145
      ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 99 
of great importance, especially in the absence of effective 
machinery for bringing about attendance. 
Even more striking are the differences in the attendance 
of the children of high school age. In one-room rural 
schools, pupils 15 years of age and over comprise only 9 
per cent. of the total enrolment; and this 9 per cent. 
attended school only 50 per cent. of the time. In city 
schools, on the other hand, this same age-group makes 
up 26 per cent. of the total enrolment and they make 
an attendance record of gr per cent. The failure of the 
one-room rural school not only to attract but to hold 
children 15 or more years of age thus unquestionably 
indicates both a lack of supporting sentiment on the 
part of parents, and, quite as clearly, the inability of 
the one-room rural school to provide work suited to - 
the ability and the interests of children of high school 
age. 
Whatever the causes of the poor attendance, that 14 
per cent. of the children enrolled in the schools of the 
cities should be absent every day is bad enough; but that 
as many as 36 per cent. of those in one-room rural schools 
should be continuously absent is fatal te effective work. 
What can be expected in the way of instruction when in 
one-room rural schools 31 per cent. of the children, in 
the village schools 19 per cent., and in the city schools 8 
per cent., are absent on the average more than half the 
time? The significance of these facts in terms of the 
amount of instruction received is illustrated by condi- 
tions in a fifth grade containing 6 pupils in the Sandy 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    too PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
Mountain School of Carroll County. During the first 
100 days of the past school year, the number of spelling 
lessons received by each pupil was as follows: One pupil 
received the full 100 lessons—for he was never absent— 
the second received 98, the third 94, the fourth 81, the 
fifth 69, the sixth 57, for he was absent almost half of the 
time. If the work to be properly done required 100 
lessons, a pupil receiving only 57 lessons has at best 
covered but slightly more than half of the work of the 
grade. 
The effect of absence would be less disastrous if it were 
continuous at some one period; that is, one prolonged 
absence is infinitely preferable to recurrence of brief peri- 
ods of absence. Yet recurrence is the rule. The child 
comes to school for a few days and then stays away a few 
days; and thus throughout the year. A single case will 
illustrate. Pupil “A” in School No. 2, District 7, 
Carroll County, was present the first four days of 
the first week of the term. Then an absence of five 
days occurred, followed by five days in school and 
eight days out. A single day covered the next period 
of attendance; then five days of absence; next two days 
at school and two at home, and so on to the end of the 
term. 
Absence destroys the morale and wastes the time not 
only of the absentee but of the entire school. A teacher, 
seeking to keep the absentees up with the class, gives 
them special attention when they do attend, and in this 
way neglects the pupils regularly at school. Or, despair-
-P-A-G-E-147
  ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE IOI 
ing of keeping the absentees up to grade, she makes of 
them a separate group, thus adding to the already exces- 
sive number of classes. Effective work is impossible 
under such conditions. 
The friends of public education in Maryland have not 
been unaware of the situation which we have described. 
The State Board of Education, the county superintend- 
ents, and bodies of citizens have repeatedly urged the 
passage of a compulsory school attendance law. At a 
recent session of the legislature their hopes seemed about 
to be realized. When, however, the proposed bill came 
from the legislature most of its effective features had been 
eliminated. Worse still, compulsory measures were 
made optional with the county school boards, Howard, 
Kent, Anne Arundel, Worcester, St. Mary’s, and 
Somerset counties being even denied the privilege of 
exercising an option. Wretched as is this makeshift, 
the law has had a perceptible effect, as is evidenced by the 
increase of attendance between 1910 and 1914.1 Mary- 
land is, however, for all practical purposes still without 
an attendance law worthy of thename. In consequence, 
her public schools are now reaching less than three- 
fourths of the white children of school age (6-18), while 
probably half of her white children are taking up the 
duties of parenthood and of citizenship with a fifth-grade 
education or less. More money may be spent upon 
schoolhouses, better prepared and higher priced teachers

may be employed, and adequate professional control and 
supervision may be provided, but unless the children of 
school age are gotten into the schools and kept there 
regularly, the results achieved must continue to be unsat- 
isfactory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
VIII. INSTRUCTION 
educational system, perhaps the most serious is 
the difficulty of reaching and justifying a judg- 
ment as to the quality of instruction. Within any given 
system, no matter what the conditions in respect to the 
training of teachers, their appointment, or their super- 
vision, great variations, arising from differences of ability 
and industry, will inevitably occur. Under the most 
unfavorable circumstances effective teaching will some- 
times be found. It would therefore be unfair to-brand 
all the teaching in Maryland as poor, simply because 
general conditions make for poor teaching. 
Again, the investigator’s unaided judgment is not in- 
variably sound. It ought to.be possible to prove teach- 
ing good or bad by objective tests; and indeed a promis- 
ing movement in this direction is well under way. 
Aside, however, from other obstacles, the technique of 
testing is perhaps hardly as yet well enough established 
to warrant a state-wide application. Besides the defects 
of teaching to which we shall call attention are too obvi- 
ous, too widespread to require elaborate demonstration. 
In the course of our study of public education in Mary- 
land, elementary schools were visited in every county 
103 O: ALL the difficulties connected with judging an 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
104 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
of the state; altogether more than 450 elementary teach- 
ers were observed in giving about goo lessons, every grade 
and every subject being included. As schools were vis- 
ited at random, it may be considered that the general 
situation was adequately sampled. The points in refer- 
ence to which instruction was observed were, as will 
appear in the course of this chapter, simple, fundamental, 
and untechnical. In the first place, we tried to ascertain 
whether the instruction was such as to promise children a 
competent mastery of the necessary tools of knowledge 
—reading, writing, spelling, and arithmetic; whether good 
judgment or poor judgment was used in determining the 
amount and character of the material studied in these sub- 
jects. Were children reading well-selected pieces? Were 
they learning to spell usable or useless words? Were they 
doing sensible or absurd arithmetical problems? 
In addition to the fundamental studies the course of 
study in Maryland includes a considerable variety of 
subjects—geography, history, literature, science, etc.— 
subjects that have not only instrumental but inspira- 
tional value. They assist a child to find his place in the 
world and society; they increase the range of his interests 
and activities. Such subjects may be mechanically 
taught, so as to do little good, or they may be inspiringly 
taught, so as to stir the child more or less deeply. Where- 
ever we went, we endeavored to gauge the child’s reaction 
—to determine, that is, whether the instruction was genu- 
ine or merely routine. 
Closely allied is another point of view. We spoke just
-P-A-G-E-151
  INSTRUCTION 105 
now of helping the child to find his place in the world. 
The schools used to do their teaching regardless of chil- 
dren’s experiences and environment. Nowadays there is 
general agreement that the child’s experiences and sur- 
roundings furnish the teacher with material to be used, and 
suggest to him important ends to strive toward. With- 
out pretending to offer in this connection a complete 
theory of education, we venture to think that instruc- 
tion may fairly be viewed from the standpoint of the 
child’s experiences, immediate surroundings, and probable 
needs. 
Finally, the child’s progress is to be considered. The 
very term “course of study” suggests orderly develop- 
ment. The Maryland elementary school course, occupy- 
ing seven years, promises systematic progress through 
a variety of studies. Does the instruction realize the 
promise? Do children move from point to point without 
needless friction and waste? Or is the classroom work 
more or less of treadmill character? 
These, then, are the questions informally asked re- 
garding the work of the Maryland teachers. Do children 
learn to master the fundamental subjects? Are their 
interests stimulated? Are the materials well chosen? 
Are local needs heeded? Are time and energy conserved? 
The questions are obviously not exhaustive, but, as will 
appear, they amply serve our present purpose. 
A casual visitor whose good fortune led him into 
selected schools in almost any county might answer 
these questions in the affirmative. In almost every 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  106 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
county of the state some teachers are doing excellent 
work. Their schoolrooms are bright and attractive; 
their pupils alert and happy; their methods intelligent 
and effective; the course of study is adapted to individual 
and to community needs. The teacher’s ability, train- 
ing, and ambition triumph over whatever adverse condi- 
tions may exist. 
Nonetheless, the system does not tend to produce these 
results; they come about in spite of the system. In 
the main, therefore, while gladly recognizing the existence 
of exceptions, we are constrained to answer negatively 
the questions above asked. Children do not, for the 
most part, learn to master their tools; their interests are 
far from sufficiently stimulated; local needs get, as a rule, 
scant attention; time and energy are freely wasted. 
In the first place, the general attitude of most teachers 
isunsound. They regard it as their main business, after 
keeping order, to impart to children a prescribed body 
of facts or information—so much spelling, so much arith- 
‘metic, so much geography. The facts are all there in the 
text-books, and the teachers proceed on the assumption 
that one fact is as good as another. Whatever is printed 
on the page is taught without discrimination. Imagine, 
then, a teacher giving a sixth-grade class of rural children 
a spelling lesson made up of such words as monsieur, 
connoisseur, sobriquet, sang froid, and so on. A third- 
grade geography lesson upon the Middle Atlantic States 
illustrates the same point. ‘‘Name the Middle Atlantic 
States,”’ directs the teacher, and the pupils answer either
-P-A-G-E-153
  INSTRUCTION 107 
individually or in concert. ‘‘What is the capital of 
Maryland?” “Of what is Washington the capital?” 
“Who knows what Washington is on?” ‘What is the 
capital of Virginia?’”’ So on for the remaining states of 
this division. Not a single question was put by the 
teacher calculated to arouse interest, to compel thought, 
or to bring out the meaning of what had been memorized. 
Nor did the teacher make a single comment herself. 
Thus, in subject after subject, children are expected to 
acquire facts through memorizing printed pages. Mean- 
while, strange though it seem, not half the 400 teachers 
visited felt that they themselves must know these facts. 
For the majority, while conducting the recitation, were 
compelled to keep their eyes glued on the text in order to 
ask the questions; not infrequently the whole perform- 
ance stopped, so as to enable the teacher to read ahead 
to the next question. Sometimes the teacher was com- 
pelled to look at the book to see whether the answers 
given were correct. 
Not only must the child “‘recite”’ the facts just learned, 
he must, of course, “retain” them. Hence they must be 
thoroughly beaten in and fixed permanently in memory. 
Thus endless reviews and ever-recurrent drills are ac- 
counted for. In some schools as much as half of the 
school year is devoted to ‘“‘reviews”; not uncommonly 
it was stated that pupils had covered the same books 
three or four times. A certain amount of review is, of 
course, needed to bring out the relations between differ- 
ent subjects and different parts of the same subject; 
   
-P-A-G-E-154
  1o8 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
so also a certain amount of properly conducted drill, in 
order to gain accuracy and facility in conducting funda- 
mental operations. But reviewing and drilling as carried 
on in most Maryland schools is a cruel and wasteful 
procedure calculated to kill interest and to destroy the 
child’s capacity for constructive thinking. 
A volume of this kind is not the place for a full expo- 
sition of modern ideas on teaching method. It may, 
however, not be amiss to point out that a “recitation,” 
instead of the mechanical process above described, should 
be a codperative and constructive enterprise, in which 
children work out a problem, each doing his part accord- 
ing to his ability and special assignment. It may take 
dramatic form—one child being the “big bear,” another 
the “mother bear,” still another the “little bear,” and 
one “Silver Locks”; or one group of pupils may solve 
and explain to the class a given set of examples, while 
another group is engaged with other problems; or in the 
study of such topics as Tomato Raising on the Eastern 
Shore, the Manufacture and Distribution of Fertilizer, 
Sanitary Conditions in the School District, one pupil 
may look up illustrative material such as pictures, while 
another arranges experiments, and still another brings 
before the class a review of what they have already 
learned. Thus in a hundred ways the recitation may be 
made a period of working together in the achievement 
of a common end, quickening the interest of the children, 
giving them opportunity to think, and engendering a 
social spirit. And, be it repeated, here and there
-P-A-G-E-155
  INSTRUCTION 10g 
throughout the state one really encounters classroom 
work of this description. 
The problem of discipline hinges inneely on the quality 
of instruction. Generally speaking, there exists in Mary- 
land a cordial relation between pupils and teachers; the 
children seem anxious to do what is required. Still they 
would not be human if they did not involuntarily revolt 
against a system of education which consigns active boys 
and girls, for long periods of time, to uncomfortable 
desks to pore over text-books, only to be called up and 
questioned upon what they have just absorbed. Under 
such conditions it is not surprising that the more vigor- 
ous and active find secret ways of amusement, while the 
majority sit passive, doing worse than nothing a consid- 
erable part of the time. 
There is a tendency, nowadays, to account for ineffec- 
tive teaching of the fundamental branches on the ground 
that teachers and children are so distracted by ‘“‘recent 
fads” that there is neither time nor energy left for the 
“essentials.” Whether or not this apology is anywhere 
valid, it is not for us to say; at least, it has no application 
to Maryland. The state course of study does indeed 
require that certain modern subjects should be taught; 
but its injunctions are not usually followed. Manual 
training and domestic science, for example, are found as 
a rule only in cities, though Baltimore and Wicomico 
counties encourage their use in rural districts, too. Mu- 
sic is usually limited to the singing of songs in connection 
with morning exercises; little attention is, as a rule, paid 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  IIo PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
to drawing. In many cities and in quite all villages and 
rural sections, the only branches taught are reading, 
Writing, spelling, language and grammar, arithmetic, 
geography, history, and physiology. To the three R’s 
Maryland children now devote fully three-quarters of 
their school time. In some counties arithmetic con- 
sumes almost half of the entire school day; not exceeding 
one-quarter of the day goes to geography, history, physi- 
ology, and to whatever there may be in the way of music, 
drawing, and the like. Under these conditions there is 
certainly no ground in Maryland for thinking that the 
“fads” have usurped the place of the ‘“‘important” 
studies. 
Meanwhile, the time that might well be devoted to the 
so-called ‘‘fads” is worse than wasted. Too untrained 
to make use of alternative occupations—weaving, bas- 
ketry, literature, art, industry, or domestic science—the 
teacher is hard put to it to keep the class constantly occu- 
pied with book and seat work. Hence little children are 
required to copy the alphabet over and over, or to write 
again and again the numerals from one to a hundred, or, 
on occasions, up to two or three thousand. Older chil- 
dren, having acquired some ability to write, are set to 
copying page after page of their readers, or to solving 
on paper long lists of problems placed on the blackboard. 
Thus to kill time, the first-grade pupils divide 7,649,634 by 
7, and third-grade pupils divide 35,897,678,926 by 2,076. 
A favorite task, especially for older children, is to require 
them to write a corrected mistake 50 or 100 times!

INSTRUCTION IIL 
Of course formal reiterative work of this kind quickly 
degenerates into a purely mechanical repetition, during 
which the child’s mind goes “‘wool-gathering,” though 
the hands keep working away. Children may be kept 
“busy” through such assignments, but they will never 
be “taught.” This is illustrated by the well-known 
story of the boy who having spelt “gone” “gorn” was 
required to write 500 times, “I have gone home.” He 
completed the distasteful task by writing: “I am done 
and I have gorn home.” 
When the methods described fail, as fail they must, 
the untrained teacher naturally leaps to the conclusion 
that ‘‘more time” is needed. Accordingly, large assign- 
ments and enormous tasks are given out for home work. 
In consequence, children going home from school are to 
be seen almost everywhere with bundles of books por- 
tending night study. If school conditions were good, 
there would be no occasion for night work on the part 
of growing children. But even as conditions now are, in 
the majority of schools, no useful end is served by it. 
The children had better spend their after-school time at 
play, helping about the farm or the home, reading or 
asleep. ‘Home work” merely lengthens the hours of 
mechanical school drudgery. Nor is the value of the in- 
struction any greater, even if some children can be 
tempted by prizes and privileges, to make greater efforts 
to master it. 
What we have said above as to the general character 
of instruction may be briefly illustrated by separate sub-  
-P-A-G-E-160
  112. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
jects. The most important of the common school studies 
is reading; and reading is important because—and only 
because—it is a key to meanings, to ideas, to information, 
etc. A child should therefore be taught not only to pro- 
nounce printed words, but to gather and to express the 
meaning of what he reads; for which purpose he should be 
trained to read not only aloud, but, as the children say, 
“to himself.” The children in the Maryland schools, 
like, we are in candor compelled to add, the children in 
most other schools, get little exercise in the art of reading 
beyond the mechanical utterance of printed words and 
sentences. Little or nothing is done in the reading les- 
son to arouse the imagination; reading is rarely used to 
cultivate facility in oral expression. Lacking, then, an 
adequate motive, reading in the lower grades is apt to 
degenerate into mere mumbling, and in the upper grades 
to drop out almost altogether. Only here and there does 
one find a teacher who realizes the possibilities of the 
subject. 
Spelling is in substantially the same situation. In the 
elementary schools children should, for obvious reasons, 
learn to spell the words they themselves ordinarily use, 
the words they ordinarily hear, the words used in the 
other branches which they study, and, finally, words that 
are in common daily use. These words children must 
and can know both how to spell and how to use. The 
Maryland schools have reached no such conclusions as 
these on the subject of spelling. To them, as already 
pointed out, a word is a word, and it is just as important
-P-A-G-E-161
  INSTRUCTION 113 
to learn one word as another. Accordingly, long and in- 
discriminate lists are given out, and from the fourth 
grade up, children endeavor unsuccessfully to become 
letter perfect in the acquisition of from 20 to 50 words 
a day. 
Arithmetic, like spelling, is a tool needed for the 
transaction of the ordinary affairs of life. It ought, 
therefore, to be studied in connection with its uses; it is, 
moreover, a waste of time to study any more of it than 
can be used. Dry measure is thus not a table to be 
memorized from a book, but an instrument needed in 
order to buy potatoes, apples, peaches, and the like from 
the neighboring store. Occasionally—it would perhaps 
be more nearly accurate to say ‘‘rarely””—one sees arith- 
metic taught in Maryland from this standpoint. The 
teacher, in these instances, centres arithmetic almost 
entirely upon farming and its problems, leading the 
children to see that arithmetic is the basis of intelligent 
farm management. Incidentally, arithmetic managed 
in this way affords the teacher opportunity to give valu- 
able lessons upon soils, crops, and soil exhaustion, and to 
study the ingredients of different fertilizers in relation 
to the needs of the locality. The child learns to “figure,” 
and much besides. 
For the most part, however, arithmetic is taught in the 
schools of Maryland without reference to its uses; under 
which conditions one thing is just as important as an- 
other. Cube root and the mensuration of cubes, pyra- 
mids, and truncated cones receive as much attention as
-P-A-G-E-162
  114 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
home and farm accounting. Instruction, then, degen- 
erates into memorizing formal tables and rules and the 
solution of printed problems. This formal work, al- 
ready occupying from a fourth to a half of the time of the 
children at school, is also carried off to the home, where 
by lamplight long lists of printed problems are copied 
and solved by way of preparation for the next day, when 
the same problems are re-copied and re-solved. Not 
infrequently children have copied and solved, re-copied 
and re-solved these problems so many times that they can 
repeat whole pages of them from memory. 
While some good teaching was observed in the field of 
geography, the greater part of the teachers do not realize 
that the prime source of geographic materials is the 
immediate environment of the school: the mountains and 
hills, the rivers and valleys, the effect of climate and 
change of season upon vegetable life, animal life, and 
local industrial and commercial activities. Instead, they 
follow a printed text. Hence, children recite haltingly 
about tidal-rivers and their significance, without knowing 
that the brook just across from the schoolhouse is a 
tidal-river; or they answer questions about the Appala- 
chian Mountains, even giving the names and location of 
the minor ranges, without realizing that the mountains 
seen from the schoolhouse window are the ones they are 
talking about. Again, in physiology, pupils recite about 
bacteria, first aid, and various ailments. Meanwhile, 
they breathe an atmosphere filled with the dust just 
raised by an old-fashioned broom, use not infrequently

a common dipper, and resort to filthy and unsanitary 
outhouses. 
All the problems of instruction are complicated in the 
one-room school. Before good instruction can be gen- 
erally expected in such schools the state must plan a 
simple course of study, with alternating classes, so that 
the number of classes may be reduced. This course of 
study should not be copied from city schools, but must 
be adapted to the education of country children under 
rural conditions. It may also be found necessary to 
limit to less than seven the grades of work to be covered 
in the one-room schools. At all events, classes above 
the seventh grade formed for the convenience of two or 
three advanced pupils must be abandoned. Twenty-five 
to thirty-five daily recitations—the average in the one- 
room rural school—are more than can be well handled. 
If eight or ten more “classes” are added for the benefit 
of two or three advanced pupils, the teacher’s energies 
are so scattered that no one gets proper attention in any- 
thing. Provision must be made for these older pupils 
in consolidated schools. 
On the one hand, therefore, the one-room school 
must be simplified and better organized; on the other, 
wherever possible, one-room schools should be consoli- 
dated so that a larger body of pupils may be properly 
graded, and better equipment, better teachers, and better 
accommodations provided for them. There is not a 
county in Maryland in which the number of one-room 
schools could not thus be greatly reduced. Something 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  
116 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
has indeed already been accomplished in this direction. 
In Prince George County the Baden Agricultural High 
School, organized in 1911, took the place of two one-room 
schools and now draws the older pupils from eight others. 
The enrolment for the entire region has increased, and the 
attendance, particularly of the older children, improved. 
A better school spirit has developed, and the community 
is inordinately proud of its consolidated school. Similar 
results have also been achieved at the Sparks Agricul- 
tural High School, Baltimore County. Howard, Mont- 
gomery, Caroline, and a few others also furnish examples. 
But consolidation is not yet an active state policy. 
Instruction in the colored schools is, as one would 
expect, distinctly inferior to that in the white schools. 
There is, however, a movement well under way which 
is contributing to improvement. Through the aid of the . 
state at least one central industrial school has been 
established in each of sixteen counties. In these central 
schools industrial instruction is confined in the main to 
the older children, comprising for girls sewing and cook- 
ing, and for the boys woodwork. The girls make some 
of their own clothes and cook, while the boys make from 
wood simple household articles and furniture. The in- 
struction is exceedingly practical, usually of good quality, 
giving girls a training in home duties and boys some skill 
with tools and an appreciation of manual labor. 
Under the direction of the colored supervisor indus- 
trial instruction is being gradually introduced into the 
tural and village schools of counties possessing a central

school of the type just described. In the lower grades 
children do paper-cutting and basketry; the girls have 
simple sewing, and the boys whittling. In the upper 
grades the girls learn plain sewing and dressmaking and, 
in a few schools, some cooking. While the boys in the 
one-room schools are handicapped for lack of a shop and 
tools, they are, nevertheless, doing some woodwork, 
making articles for the home and doing repairs about the 
schoolhouse; in one case they have drained the school 
grounds, repaired the sidewalk and fence, and painted 
the school building. 
Instruction in the high schools is but little better than 
that in the elementary schools and is in general character- 
ized by the same defects. For, like the elementary 
school teacher, the high school teacher lacks proper pro- 
fessional training; and, like the elementary school, the 
high school, despite its recent development, is hampered 
by tradition. 
The public high schools of Maryland have grown 
rapidly since 1905. The first list of accredited high 
schools, carrying out acceptably the course of study 
prescribed by the state, made up in 1905, included only 
28 schools with an enrolment of 2,049 ‘children and 88 
teachers. Since then an entire year has been added to 
the course and the state standards have become some- 
what more exacting; nevertheless, there were in 1914, 65 
  
1High schools were visited in every county of the state having them. 
In addition to conferences with principals and teachers, classwork was 
carefully observed in fifty schools.
-P-A-G-E-170
  118 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
accredited high schools enrolling 5,500 pupils and em- 
ploying 221 teachers. Not a few of these schools are the 
outgrowths of old academies. 
In this transition from the academy to the public high 
school the aims and methods of the academy were un- 
fortunately very largely carried over. The old acad- 
emy, though it rendered a worthy service in its day, was a 
“select” school, privately controlled, which prepared 
for college and gave to those not going farther a “‘cul- 
tural” education. Handicapped by this tradition, too 
many of the new high schools promote ‘‘cultural”’ educa- 
tion and preparation for college. Latin and mathemat- 
ics continue to dominate the curriculum. There is, of 
course, no reason why children who desire to study Latin 
should be prevented from doing so. But in Maryland 
they are practically compelled to study Latin, though, 
legally, the subject is not compulsory. In the main, it is 
so poorly taught, that, aside from the waste of time and 
energy, most students must be contracting from it habits 
of thought and expression that are a real handicap. 
Hardly better is the plight of mathematics. The state 
requirements are not unusual, including algebra through 
quadratics and plane geometry. But few high schools 
are content with this; the majority offer, besides, ad- 
vanced algebra, solid geometry, and trigonometry. 
Whether all high school pupils, both boys and girls, 
should be required to study algebra and geometry, is 
sufficiently doubtful; indeed an increasingly influential 
body of educators would answer in the negative. But

     INSTRUCTION 11g 
as to advanced algebra, solid geometry, and trigonometry 
there is no doubt whatsoever. To constrain students in 
numbers to take these subjects is simply unpardonable. 
They have long since been dropped from the high school 
course of many of our largest cities and they should be 
eliminated in Maryland, too. The curriculum in com- 
mon use should be so formulated that the majority of 
high school pupils will no longer be forced to devote to 
these two studies from two-fifths to a half of their entire 
school time, to the neglect of every other line of legiti- 
mate secondary instruction. 
The remainder of the curriculum need not detain us 
long. Something like one-half of the school day is avail- 
able for all other subjects—English, history, civics, 
science, etc. The instruction in English is extremely 
meagre, consisting, as a rule, largely of grammar, rhetoric, 
and the learning of unimportant data in connection with 
the study of selected pieces—a futile and depressing 
expenditure of energy; English history occupies a place in 
the first year, while American history is reviewed in the 
fourth; the study of civics is a memory grind not calcu- 
lated to give the student any insight into community 
activities and needs, or to develop a sense of civic pride 
and social responsibility. 
The instruction in science is also unsatisfactory. Out- 
side of general science in the first year, little is ordinarily 
attempted, only the stronger schools regularly offering 
courses in biology, physics, and chemistry. Few schools 
have regular science teachers; as a rule, the subject is 
    
-P-A-G-E-174
  120 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
taught by teachers whose interest lies elsewhere. Ac- 
cordingly, it happens that classes complete the work in 
general science and even in biology without making an 
excursion or performing an experiment. Even in labora- 
tory sciences like chemistry and physics pupils are seldom 
required to keep orderly notebooks. The majority of 
the high schools lack adequate scientific equipment; the 
“laboratory” may be set up in a hall alcove or in a base- 
ment room. Naturally enough, there is in most high 
schools little interest in science on the part of either 
teachers or pupils. 
From what point of view should the curricula of these 
schools be developed? In the rural sections of Mary- 
land the centre of interest is in farming, stock-raising, 
fruit-growing, dairying, poultry-culture, and the like. 
Through these and kindred activities country people 
make their living; in them the country children of to- 
morrow will find employment. A country high school 
must, indeed—like a city high school—teach literature, 
history, and civics. But, in addition, on the boy’s side, 
the curriculum should stress applied science, industry, 
and agriculture; while, on the girl’s side, it should em- 
phasize domestic art and such studies as equip women to 
become intelligent home makers. The rural high school 
needs little commerce with ancient languages and col- 
lege entrance requirements. The mass of students who 
do not go to conventional colleges must not be sacrificed 
for the few who do.

cities of Maryland, with one exception, are small—de- 
pends upon business and productive industry. The on- 
coming generation will, for the most part, be engaged in 
retail trade and in manufacture. Judging from what 
goes on in most of the city high schools, one would infer 
that their students are all going to college with the ulti- 
mate expectation of leading either a professional life or a 
life of leisure. There is scarcely anything in the instruc- 
tion to suggest that the home town offers fields of activity 
worthy of ambitious young people. The small city high 
schools must perhaps prepare for college, but their pri- 
mary aim should be to give young people an education 
which, while contributing to personal enjoyment and re- 
finement, prepares at the same time for the conditions 
of life that they will meet. By so doing, the high school 
will do most for ninety-five out of every hundred stu- 
dents in attendance. 
Fortunately, a beginning in the right direction has al- 
ready been made. A few of the first-group high schools 
and something less than one-half the second-group high 
schools pay some attention to agriculture and rural life. 
Two decidedly successful examples of this endeavor are 
the rural high schools already mentioned at Sparks and 
Baden. The remainder of the second-group schools, to 
say nothing of the first-group, still continue to furnish 
country children with a cityfied education which closes 
their eyes to the opportunities of country life, and tends 
powerfully to drive them toward the towns. 
In contrast, the efforts of the state in the direction of
-P-A-G-E-178
  122 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
commercial courses have met with unusualsuccess. There 
are now in all first-group high schools, save one, and in 17 
of the second-group, business departments offering two 
years of instruction in commercial branches; their total 
enrolment in 1914 was 692 pupils. Two factors account 
for this development: first, the desire of young people for 
a “useful” education; second, the desire to escape the 
grind of Latin and mathematics. For these commercial 
departments there is a legitimate place in most first- 
group schools. It is, however, questionable whether 
many second-group schools, rural as they are in their 
environment, should offer elaborate commercial courses. 
Up to the present time there has been little demand for 
a two-year commercial course in these second-group 
schools, most of the commercial departments in them 
being maintained at relatively heavy expense for the 
accommodation of from 5 to 10 pupils. In the second 
place, commercial training once more turns country-bred 
boys and girls away from the farm to become job seekers 
in the cities. 
There is, besides, in both first- and second-group high 
schools a marked tendency to increase out of all propor- 
tions the amount of work demanded in the commercial 
courses. The state course of study wisely requires com- 
mercial students to devote a fourth to a half of their time 
to general high school work. But ina number of both first- 
and second-group high schools, the prescribed hours of 
instruction in the commercial branches now absorb almost 
the entire time of the student, to the neglect of studies

which contribute to general intelligence and breadth of 
view. Owing to its inadequate staff, the State Depart- 
ment of Education has not been in position to know in 
detail what the high schools are doing. If the department 
is reorganized, it will be enabled to keep in touch with the 
situation, and it should have the power in its discretion 
to disapprove the establishment of special departments. 
In the distribution of state aid to secondary schools, 
consistent encouragement has been given to manual 
training and domestic science. As a result, these 
branches are more widely taught in Maryland than 
in most states. While there is still much to be de- 
sired, children do at least get an opportunity to acquire 
practical information and to gain skill in the making of 
real things; moreover, they obtain a certain amount of 
relief from the routine of conventional academic study. 
The situation in the four-year state-aided high school 
is, therefore, not altogether unpromising. Meanwhile, 
aside from the regular high schools, there are many one- or 
two-room schools that attempt one or more years of high 
school instruction. Further, a few schools—such, for 
example, as that of Damascus, Montgomery County, and 
some old academies such as that at Vienna, Dorchester 
County,’ specially legislated into high school status, 
1This school has lately come under the control of the County Board 
of Education; but when the transfer was made, the academy trustees, 
while obligating the County Board to continue the so-called high school 
department, retained the right to appoint the principal. Though ob- 
viously illegal, this arrangement is by no means uncommon even in 
state-aided high schools—it is found, for example, in the high school 
of Bel Air, Harford County. It should be absokutely prohibited. 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
  124 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
attempt high school work with a single teacher. The 
state ought to realize that high school work of this kind 
is simply counterfeit. Only through school consolida- 
tion and the transportation of pupils can genuine high 
school opportunities be brought within reach of all the 
children of Maryland. The amount of instruction that 
may be offered in one-, two-, and three-roomschools should 
therefore be strictly limited, and the State Department of 
Education must be so equipped that the law can be en- 
forced. 
A single paragraph may summarize our estimate of 
teaching in the public schools of Maryland. We have 
found the State Department ineffective, largely because 
it lacks the necessary staff; we have found the county 
organization ineffective because of politics, the absence 
of trained officials, and the low standards of teacher 
training. How could teaching be generally good under 
these conditions? Maryland gets precisely the kind and 
quality of teaching which our previous study would 
lead us to expect. It will improve teaching when it 
improves the conditions responsible for it—not before, 
and in no other way.

does Maryland pay? The education furnished 
is mostly poor: is it also cheap? Or does the 
state pay high for what it gets? These and some related 
questions will be answered in the course of the present 
chapter. 
An increasing amount of money is being annually 
raised in Maryland for public education. The total 
amount raised in the entire state, including the city of 
Baltimore, was in 1870 in round terms a million dollars; 
in 1914, five millions. (Fig. 17.) These amounts cover FE: the results which we have just described, what

all the money received during the current -year, irrespec- 
tive of whether it went into new buildings, repairs, teach- 
ers’ salaries, text-books, or school supplies. 
Does this mean that the state is paying more per in- 
dividual child? In 1870 there were practically 300,000 
children of school age” in the state; in 1910 there were 
something over 400,000; the exact increase was 41 per 
cent. (Fig. 18.) Hence, while school population has 
increased 41 per cent., the total school fund has in- 
creased 277 per cent. Per child of school age (Fig. 19) 
the amount available has therefore risen from $4.59 in 
1870 to $12.26 in 1914, an increase of 171 per cent.® 
1Tt would be instructive to compare the financial support of the schools 
in Maryland with that of other states, but it is almost impossible to se- 
cure reliable data for such comparisons. Indeed it was only with great 
difficulty that data on the financial support of the schools of Maryland 
have been brought together. It was impossible to use the reported ex- 
penditures as found in the annual reports of the State Board of Education, 
because these include payments of current loans, and because of the 
differences, especially some years back, between the reported expenditures 
by the several county boards and their receipts as reported by the State 
Controller. These are samples of the difficulties encountered in com- 
piling accurate financial data for Maryland. Similar revision would 
have to be made of the published reports of other states, if comparisons 
are to be trustworthy. One general statement may, however, be made: 
Maryland is one of the states which make very large state contribu- 
tions for local educational purposes. 
*In Chapter VII (Enrolment and Attendance) we used as a basis 
children between 6 and 18 years of age, though the law regards all persons 
between 5 and 20 asof school age. A defect in the Federal Census com- 
pels us in the present chapter to use the number of persons between 5 and 
20 years old in computing per capita cost and expenditure. The incon- 
sistency is not, however, of any practical importance. For the outcome

wealth to be drawn upon; and every dollar of wealth 
pays almost twice as much as it paid in 1870. 
Education is, however, not merely a question of how 
much is spent; much depends on the different purposes 
served by a given expenditure. Fully to understand the

public school system of Maryland during the period we 
are considering, that is, from 1870 to 1914, we ought to 
know the amount of money devoted to each of several 
important items—to erecting new buildings, to repairing 
old ones, to maintaining the plant, to administration, 
supervision, teachers’ salaries, text-books, supplies, etc. 
A proper system of school accounting would supply such 
information; unfortunately, the older systems, among 
them the system still employed in Maryland, do not. 
For this reason, one of the improvements needed in the 
State Department is the introduction of an up-to-date 
   
-P-A-G-E-190
  130 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
system of school accounts. In lieu, therefore, of detailed 
knowledge which would enable us to make a critical and 
comparative study of expenditure and results, we must 
content ourselves with the consideration and comparison 
of total amounts spent from year to year. 
We have thus far spoken in terms of the entire school 
population; i. e., all persons between 5 and 20 years of age. 
It is, of course, obvious that this means the nominal 
rather than the actual school population, for children 
below 6 or above 18 should be practically eliminated from 
consideration. As a matter of fact, in 1870, only 38 
children out of each 100 between 5 and 20 years of age 
attended school, and in 1914 only 59. (Fig. 23.) Our

computation of per capita expenditure on the basis of the

the actual per capita expenditure; for the expenditure on

much larger than the amount of money raised per child 
of the school population. We saw a moment ago that 
the amount raised per child of school population in 1870 
was $4.59; the amount really expended per pupil enrolled 
in that year was $12.06. (Fig. 24.) The amount raised 
per pupil of school age in 1914 was $12.26; the amount

really spent for each pupil in 1914 was $20.84. That is, 
between 1870 and 1914 the actual expenditure for each 
pupil in school attendance increased from $12.06 to $20.84 
—an increase of 73 per cent. 
So far, then, taking the state as a whole, it is only fair 
‘Figure 24 shows a drop between 1870 and 1890. This decrease was 
due to the relatively small increase during these three decades in the 
total amount raised for the schools (Fig. 17), to the relatively rapid 
increase, during the same period, in the school population (Fig. 18), and 
to the increase in the proportion of the school population taking advan- 
tage of the opportunities afforded by the schools (Fig. 23). The rapid 
increase in per-pupil expenditure since 1890, the amount almost doubling, 
is due more especially to the increased funds provided for the support of 
the schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
    
        
     132 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
to say that Maryland, as a state, has, since 1870, not only 
provided a larger total sum for public education, but that 
it has provided a larger sum per pupil. The state had 
thus a better right to expect good schools in 1914 with 
a per-pupil expenditure of $20.84 than in 1890 with a 
per-pupil cost of $9.08, or in 1870 with a per-pupil cost 
of $12.06. Can the same be said of the counties, taken 
separately? 
The wealth of Maryland is unequally distributed. 
The increase in school funds has not, therefore, been 
entirely uniform. Between 1890 and 1900 (Fig. 25) the

increase in expenditure per pupil enrolled was nowhere 
considerable; in Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary’s counties 
there was a decline. From 1900 to 1914, however, every 
county in the state, without exception, increased its per 
capita expenditures, some of them very largely. The 
lowest percentage of increase—that of Charles County— 
was about 50 per cent.; the highest Dorchester County, 
160 per cent. Of the 23 counties of the state, 13 more 
than doubled their per-pupil outlay between 1900 and 
1914,! with the result that existing disparities were still 
further emphasized. Thus, in 1890, with per-pupil ex- 
penditure varying in the counties from $4.92 to $11.97, 
there was less disparity in respect to educational ad- 
vantages than in 1914, when $9.17 was spent upon each 
pupil in Charles County and $28.81 upon each pupil in 
Baltimore County. (Fig. 25.) These enormous differ- 
ences are, of course, pregnant with consequences to the 
individual child. 
As we have seen, public education in Maryland, as in 
other states, is paid for by both state and county. From 
1870 up to the present time the counties of Maryland and 
the city of Baltimore have raised annually about 70 per 
cent. of the money expended for education; the state has 
contributed about 30 per cent. (Fig. 26.) While the 
relative proportion of all school expenditures borne by the 
state has not materially changed, the total amount dis- 
tributed to the counties has risen from $458,000 in 1870 to 
  
Allegany, Baltimore, Caroline, Carroll, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, 
Garrett, Montgomery, Queen Anne, Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester.

$1,675,000 in 1914, representing an increase both in the 
amount provided by the state per child of the school popu-

The funds distributed by the state are derived from 
several sources. Far the largest factor is the state school 
tax, which, ranging from 10 cents on each $100 in 1870 
to 17 cents in 1915, is levied against all the taxable prop-

erty of the state and produced, in 1914, $1,654,000. Out 
of this fund are paid in the first instance the expenses of 
the State Department of Education, the maintenance of 
the three State Normal Schools, Teachers’ Retirement 
allowances,! the income on the Surplus Revenue Fund, 
the special aid to high schools and colored industrial 
schools, and the Free Text-book Fund. After meeting 
these charges, there remained in 1914 $1,305,000 which 
was divided between the counties and the city of Balti- 
more on the basis of the population between 5 and 20 
years of age. 
Almost every state in the Union has at one time or 
another apportioned its general school fund on the basis 
of school population, as Maryland still does. But the 
method is in process of abandonment throughout the 
country, and for obvious reasons. Education is, we have 
said, a state function. The state supports it liberally 
because the state desires that all children should enjoy 
substantial educational advantages. If the matter were 
left to counties and districts, the disparities in educa- 
Provision was made, in 1902, for a straight-out annual pension of 
$200 to be paid all teachers, irrespective of financial ability, who, having 
reached the age of sixty, had taught in the schools of the state twenty-five 
years, and were disqualified for further service. Within three years it 
became evident that the financial burden involved was more than the 
state could afford. The law was accordingly amended to provide that 
pensions should be paid to those only who were “without other means of 
comfortable support.” On this basis, the sum required increased to 
$38,000 in 1914, the total number of teachers drawing pensions being 161. 
The law has been administered with great care, but the entire question 
of teachers’ pensions needs to be re-studied. The present provision, 
while relieving certain individuals, cannot be regarded as a final solution. 
There is good reason to believe that no non-contributory pension system 
on a large scale is either wise or feasible.  
-P-A-G-E-196
  
136 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
tional opportunity would be intolerable. The state’s 
contribution must therefore be employed to equalize 
conditions. Do what the commonwealth will, this 
highly desirable object cannot be fully attained; that is, 
however, only the stronger reason for doing the best 
possible. 
Apportionment on the basis of population aggravates 
inequalities instead of mitigating them. Certain coun- 
ties are able to provide good schools quite apart from state 
aid. Unquestionably, they should not for that reason be 
altogether passed over; but they cannot fairly complain 
if the adoption of a more intelligent basis of distribution 
somewhat reduces their share. Again, the rural counties 
being more thinly settled, a single teacher instructs 
fewer children in the country than in the city. The 
cost of instruction is therefore higher in the rural districts; 
apportionment on the basis of school population alone is 
therefore unfair to those sections that are most in need of 
help. Finally, the Federal Census on the basis of which 
the apportionment is made is actually correct only for the 
year in which it is taken; a considerable error may occur 
during all the other years of the decade. For example, 
according to the Federal Census, Baltimore County 
had, in 1910, 39,306 children between the ages of 5 and 
20; the distribution of the state school tax was, however, 
made in 1910 on the basis of her having 26,290 children, 
meaning a loss to the county in a single year of approxi- 
mately $24,000. Contrariwise, while the census of 1910 
gave Queen Anne 5,924 children between 5 and 20, the

county was credited in the division of the state school tax 
in that year with 6,042 children, thereby receiving from 
the state $3,500 more than the actual number of children 
at the time entitled her to. Such inequalities in the dis- 
tribution of the state school tax are unavoidable so long 
as the Federal Census is relied upon to provide the basis 
of distribution. 
The counties need funds mainly to pay the salaries 
of the teachers; a ‘‘fair’’ distribution would there- 
fore tend to make it equally feasible for all counties 
to employ at decent salaries the number of teachers 
really required. That is, if distribution on the basis of 
school population worked equitably, the counties would 
receive approximately equal amounts per teacher. As a 
matter of fact, the amounts received per teacher vary from 
$277 in Baltimore City to $147 per teacherin Cecil County. 
No two counties receive the same sum. (Fig. 28.) Dis- 
tribution on the basis of school population is therefore 
distinctly unfair. A more equitable basis is sorely 
needed. 
A second fund, known as the Common Free School 
Fund, is composed of three items. The first item con- 
sisted of an investment of $278,000 derived from taxes 
upon state bank stock, collected in the first instance in 
1816, and yielding in 1914 an income of $6,000. The 
original intention was to distribute annually to the coun- 
ties in equal shares the entire amount of taxes collected. 
It, however, so happened that for years certain counties 
had no schools upon which they could properly spend
-P-A-G-E-200
  138 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
their money. Their unexpended share was accordingly 
left with the State Treasurer and held for them as a 
permanent investment. The amounts now so held vary 
from $21,400 in the name of Frederick County, to $4,300 
for St. Mary’s. Baltimore City, Allegany, Charles, Cal-

vert, and Garrett counties do not now participate in this 
fund, they having used in times long past their full share 
in the current support of their schools. Hence, while 
the other counties now receive from this fund annually 
from $150 to $750, nothing at all is received by these 
four counties and the city of Baltimore.
-P-A-G-E-201
  FINANCE 139 
“The second item of the Common Free School Fund 
consisted of $229,000, having as its origin $169,000 re- 
turned by the United States Government in 1858 to 
Maryland as interest on money advanced by her to the 
National Government during the War of 1812. The 
income, amounting to $10,400 in 1914, is distributed 
annually to the counties on the basis of their representa- 
tion in the General Assembly. From the educational 
standpoint, this basis of distribution is arbitrary. For 
example, Calvert County in 1914 had three representa- 
tives with 4,119 children between 5 and 20, whereas 
Queen Anne, with the same number of representatives, 
had 5,924, or almost a third more children to provide for. 
The apportionment of school funds upon the basis of the 
number of representatives in the General Assembly thus 
disregards the main purpose of a state school fund, viz., 
the equalization of school advantages, since it takes no 
account of the number of children to be educated or of the 
disparity between the several counties in respect to their 
financial ability to support schools. 
The final item of the Common Free Fund is known as 
the Surplus Revenue Fund. It is the part of the surplus 
revenue, distributed in 1837 by the United States, and in 
Maryland set apart for the benefit of the schools. Un- 
fortunately, as in so many other states, the original 
amount was spent; the state, however, obligated itself 
to provide an annual income equal to 5 per cent. interest. 
Until 1910 this income amounting to $34,069 was de- 
rived from indirect taxes and paid from the General
-P-A-G-E-202
  
140 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
Treasury; since then it has been deducted from the money 
raised from the state school tax, and for this reason, the 
Surplus Revenue Fund may be said to be virtually lost 
to the schools. 
A somewhat complicated plan was devised for the dis- 
tribution of this income. In the first place, the sum of 
$2,000 was set aside for the indigent blind. The re- 
mainder was then-divided into two equal parts, one part 
being distributed to the counties and Baltimore City on 
the basis of white population, the other divided equally 
among the counties and the city of Baltimore. Once 
more sound principles are ignored. Of the two methods 
of distribution employed, the former is unfair to counties 
with a large colored population, the latter does nothing 
to equalize educational facilities. , 
Next in importance is the so-called ‘‘ Academic” Fund, 
not, as its name would appear to indicate, a productive 
investment, but merely a regular annual appropriation 
made from the General Treasury for the encouragement 
of secondary education. These appropriations began in 
1798 when donations were first made to ‘quasi-private 
county academies; by 1831 it,had become the fixed policy 
of the state to appropriate $1,200 a year to each county, 
irrespective of size and needs. Where county academies 
independent of the public school authorities were main- 
tained, the appropriation went to the trustees of these 
academies; if there were more than one, the appropriation 
was divided. If there was no academy ‘with its separate 
board of trustees, the appropriation went to the public
-P-A-G-E-203
  FINANCE 14 
school authorities. In 1914 $26,150 was distributed by 
the state in this way. 
In the distribution of the academic fund every princi- 
ple of sound educational finance is violated. Originally 
—at least subsequently to 1831—the counties were to 
share alike, itself an unsound method of procedure. 
Somewhat later an unequal’ distribution was brought 
about; but the inequalities were not dictated or suggested 
by sound principle. Wicomico, for example, with an 
enrolment of 5,888, received, in 1914, $2,400, whereas 
Carroll, with an enrolment of 6,697, secured only $200. 
But such inequalities are, after all, preferable to outright 
abuse as evidenced in the following examples: 
Washington Academy, located in Somerset County, 
some three miles from Princess Anne, was erected by 
private subscription in 1777. From 1798 until the pres- 
ent time an annual dgnation has been made from the 
“Academic Fund” to the trustees of this school, varying 
from $600 to $809. For three-quarters of a century 
Washington Academy was the centre of higher education 
in Somerset, but the doors of the building were closed 
about 1864 and never again opened for educational pur- 
poses. Fora half century thereafter bats found a friendly 
shelter in the attic and vagrants in its lower rooms. 
Still, during the entire half century of its non-existence, 
the Trustees of Washington Academy received the annual 
appropriation from the state, the accumulated amount 
of which, or as much of it as was recovered, including 
the interest, amounted by 1904 to over $12,000. With
-P-A-G-E-204
142 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
$12,000 in hand the academy trustees erected in 1904 in 
Princess Anne, upon a lot purchased with state funds 
in 1844, a modern school building. The building was 
deeded to the County School Board, but the lot is held 
by the academy trustees, and this building is to-day the 
public school of Princess Anne. Thus from funds do- 
nated by the state for the encouragement of secondary 
education, but which were not so currently used and hence 
should have been cut off, a public school building is 
erected and presented to Princess Anne. Moreover, by 
reason of the fact that this appropriation is still made to 
the Trustees of Washington Academy and applied to the 
maintenance of the present school, the state is making, 
through indirection, an annual present of $600 to Princess 
Anne. 
An even more flagrant abuse of state funds is to be 
found in connection with Patapsco Academy, Shipley 
Station, Anne Arundel County. This institution, es- 
tablished in 1837, had dwindled by 1908 to the pro- 
portions of a one-room school. Though the building and 
the grounds occupied for more than twenty years were 
the property of an individual, and the board of trustees 
had disappeared altogether, this insignificant private 
school continued to receive $400 a year from the treasury 
of the state of Maryland. In 1908 conditions seemed 
favorable to the abandonment of this ‘‘Academy” and 
to erection in the neighborhood of a much-needed public 
school supported and controlled by the County Board of 
Education. Such was not to be. A bill passed the

General Assembly confiding the future of the “‘ Academy” 
to a committee named in the law. An appropriation of 
$1,200 was provided to purchase in the name of the state 
the ancient home of the Academy, and in 1910 an addi- 
tional $500 was supplied from the General Treasury for 
repairs and improvements. Two hundred fifty dollars 
for each of the years 1910 and rg1t were added to provide 
“courses of lectures on agriculture and its kindred sub- 
jects and for hall rent and other expenses.” Thus an 
academy at best conducted for years as a private day 
school, and having in 1914 a total enrolment of 39 pupils 
with none above the fifth grade, was rehabilitated at 
state expense to serve as a private school. 
Other instances of abuse may be readily cited. Eight 
hundred dollars are annually paid by the state of Mary- 
land to Frederick County College, which is no longer in 
existence, the buildings being rented to Hood College. 
At Cumberland and at Rockville similar appropriations 
are used to bolster up obsolete institutions, in immediate 
proximity to high schools of the first rank capable of 
taking better care of all the academy students without 
additional cost; at Vienna, Bel Air, Millington, etc., 
money from the Academic Fund is employed to bring 
about private control of public high schools. It is unnec- 
essary to go further. The Academic Fund is in many 
instances wasted or worse than wasted. When the 
school finances of the state are reorganized, this money 
can be put to far more productive use. 
There remain to be considered certain special appro-  
-P-A-G-E-208
  
144 PUBLIC. EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
priations made by the General Assembly for the benefit 
of local schools. Regardless of the amount of money 
involved in these special appropriations, the principle— 
or lack of principle—makes them highly significant. 
Laws carrying special appropriations were passed, for 
example, in behalf of the Anne Arundel County Academy 
in 1900, of Greensboro, Caroline County, in 1904, of 
Federalsburg, Caroline County, and of Aberdeen in Har- 
ford County in 1906, of Patapsco Academy, Anne Arun- 
del County, in 1908. 
There is no justification for the bestowal by the legis- 
lature of school favors. State educational funds should 
be and can be distributed on the basis of principle; 
capricious departures from the rules, whatever they be, 
tend to log-rolling and other forms of demoralization. 
Garrett County is a case in point. In 1902 a special 
annual appropriation of $4,000 was deducted from the 
State School Fund for'the benefit of Garrett County on 
the ground that the resources of the county were not 
sufficient to enable her to keep her schools open the 
minimum term of seven and one-half months required 
by law at that time. When first granted the appropria- 
tion was endorsed by the State Board of Education; but 
in the meantime Garrett has grown in wealth, so that it 
stands to-day the fourteenth county of the state in the 
amount of wealth back of each child of the school popula- 
tion. Atleast eight counties are its inferiors in this respect. 
Nevertheless, the county continues to receive this special 
appropriation. To tell the truth, the county has been   
     
-P-A-G-E-209
  
FINANCE 145 
injured by this special favor, for it has been successively 
exempted from most of the progressive school legislation 
of recent years: the compulsory school attendance law, 
the minimum salary law, the nine months’ school term, 
and the like. 
Garrett County is, however, not the only recipient of 
such appropriations. Five thousand dollars were appro- 
priated in 1912 to buy land for the Ridgley Agricultural 
High School of Caroline County, and a like sum was con- 
tributed from the State Treasury toward the erection of 
a public school building at Federalsburg. The same 
General Assembly gave Caroline, Queen Anne, and Tal- 
bot counties, together, $4,000 to be used in building what 
is known as the Tri-County High School. Talbot County 
again in 1914 received $7,500, in part payment of the cost 
of erecting a school building at Sudlersville. 
All such special appropriations must be strongly con- 
demned. The case is not helped by the pretext that 
the schools were to do special work in agriculture, for the 
state, as is well known, already gives a bonus for the 
teaching of agriculture in high schools; the schools spe- 
cially favored never contemplated more than is being done 
in the Boys’ High School at Frederick, the Baden Agri- 
cultural High School of Prince George County, and the 
Sparks Agricultural High School of Baltimore County— 
schools built and supported entirely at county expense. 
The fact is that the counties wanted schools which 
could not be provided at local expense without consid- 
erable sacrifice. Special appropriations had already 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  
146 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
been made for other localities. Why not for these? 
Political conditions were especially favorable; the local 
political leaders were enlisted in the enterprise, and the 
result is a matter of history. 
The general question of state aid to local schools must 
be surveyed from another angle. Let us assume that 
“favors” are discontinued; upon what terms should the 
state government render its assistance? Two general 
policies are in common use. Under the one, the state 
insists that local authorities, before they receive their 
full apportionment, comply with certain state require- 
ments with respect to the conduct and management oi 
the schools. Under the second, the state makes its 
contributions without imposing any particular conditions. 
Maryland occupies a middle ground. 
The bulk of the funds distributed by the state of 
Maryland to the several counties, and especially of those 
raised by direct taxation, is intended for the support of 
the elementary schools. To receive their full apportion- 
ment, local authorities are required to keep the schools 
open at least nine months during the calendar year, and to 
pay white teachers at least three hundred dollars a year.’ 
1It follows that the minimum school year is nine months. Nine coun- 
ties have a school: year of ten months: Baltimore, Calvert, Caroline, 
Carroll, Harford, Howard, Kent, Queen Anne’s, and Talbot. However, 
the colored schools do not continue so long nor is the term so uniform. 
They are open ten months in Baltimore, Harford, and Kent; nine months 
in Allegany, Carroll, Cecil, and Washington; seven to eight months in 
Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Garrett, Montgomery, Prince George, and 
Queen Anne; six to seven months in Caroline, Howard, Talbot, and 
Worcester; five to six months in Dorchester, St. Mary’s, Somerset, and 
Wicomico, and only four months in Anne Arundel.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
FINANCE 147 
Besides, the money provided for free text-books and sup- 
plies must be employed exclusively for these purposes. 
There are no other limitations; the state makes no stipu- 
lation as to the kind of superintendent that shall be em- 
ployed, or his salary, or the quality and the amount of 
supervision that shall be provided, or the kind of school- 
houses that shall be built. Nor is there any requirement 
imposed upon the counties with respect to the amount of 
money that shall be raised locally to secure the entire 
state apportionment. 
The state follows a different policy in allotting funds 
to the high schools. Specific conditions must be met if 
the local authorities are to receive the full aid of the 
state: a certain number of children must be in attendance, 
a given number of teachers must be employed, specified 
salaries paid, and courses of study of a given length 
and character offered. Under the stimulus of these 
requirements and the financial assistance conditioned 
on complying with them, the high schools made more 
progress within the last five years than during the 
two preceding decades. Counties must also meet certain 
requirements in order to secure the special assistance 
offered by the state in support of colored industrial 
schools. 
Maryland is therefore not passive in the distribution 
of funds for the support of local schools, but she is by no 
means as active as some other states or as she herself 
might well be. The very purpose of levying and dis- 
tributing a school tax is defeated unless its expenditure
-P-A-G-E-212
  148 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
is wisely and efficiently directed. It becomes the state, 
therefore, to insist upon two points: that every locality 
should put forth proper effort in its own behalf; and 
that all school funds should be spent under effective 
supervision. Maryland has not done this in the past; she 
is not doing it now. Thousands upon thousands of dol- 
lars have been poured into some of the poorer counties 
without yielding a fair educational return. This waste 
will continue until the state takes full advantage of the 
opportunity afforded by the state subsidy to bring about 
better local support and administration. A new era of 
progress will open, especially to the elementary schools, 
when the state lays down specific requirements with 
respect to the amount of taxes to be raised locally, the 
kind of schoolhouses to be erected, the preparation of 
the teachers to be employed, and the qualifications of the 
superintendent and the supervisors to be engaged, as 
pre-conditions to receiving state aid, and when, further, 
the state so organizes the State Department that proper 
guarantees can be exacted. 
In various ways now described the state of Maryland 
contributed in 1914 $1,675,201 to public education; 
meanwhile the total sum spent was $5,102,448. The 
difference—that is, $3,427,247—was raised by the coun- 
ties and the city of Baltimore by taxes levied on all prop- 
erty. The amount thus raised has everywhere increased, 
in some counties remarkably. While the increase in 
Talbot County between 1900 and 1914 was only 6.7 per 
cent., there was an increase of over 100 per cent. in seven-
-P-A-G-E-213
FINANCE 149 
teen counties, and in Somerset the rise was as much as 
470 per cent. (Fig. 29.) 
These increases mean larger, even if not everywhere 
wholly adequate, expenditure in behalf of the individual 
child. (Fig. 30.) Somerset County produced in 1890 
31 cents per child, of the school population (5-20) in 
1914, $3.57; St. Mary’s contributed 37 cents in 1890 and

expenditure per child of the school population (5-20) in 
1914 was $5.34; of this the state contributed $3.90; the 
county $1.44, or 27 per cent. Calvert spent per child 
$5.87, but only $1.85 or 31 per cent. was county money. 
In contrast, there was available in Baltimore County 
$16.45, of which county taxes produced $12.55 or 76 per

These differences are only partly due to the unequal 
financial resources of the various counties. A county’s 
ability to support schools is best indicated by the amount 
of taxable wealth back of each child. So viewed, Balti- 
more County has, in 1914, $3,840 back of each child; St. 
Mary’s, $710. Baltimore County would at the same

tax rate thus raise five or six times as much per child as 
St. Mary’s. (Fig. 33.) 
Fully as important is the relative willingness of the 
several counties to tax themselves for education. The 
county school tax rate is an excellent index of educa- 
tional interest.

Between 1890 and 1914 the tax rate went up in every 
county in the state—that is, every county in Maryland 
cared more about education in 1914 than in 1890. But’ 
just as the counties did not care equally in 1890, so they 
did not care equally in 1914. The range of disparity is 
just as great now as it was twenty-five years ago. (Fig. 
34.) At the former date Somerset was at the bottom of 
the list with a rate of 7.4 cents, Allegany at the top with 
28.1 cents. In 1914 Charles is lowest, with a rate of 
17.2 cents, and Garrett leads with a rate of 45.3 cents.

Whether a high tax rate means relative liberality and a 
low tax rate relative niggardliness is, however, another

matter. The counties are not, strictly speaking, directly 
comparable with one another, because no uniform prin- 
ciple of assessing valuation prevails throughout the state. 
Hence, one county which makes a high assessment and 
levies a moderate school tax may be doing more liberally 
by its schools than another which makes a low assess- 
ment and levies an apparently generous school tax. We 
have already urged that the state should, in order to 
equalize opportunity, do most for those counties that are 
least able to help themselves. But such inability cannot 
be at once inferred from a low assessed valuation. Little
-P-A-G-E-218
  154 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
can be done to bring about readjustment until assess- 
ments are equalized throughout the state. Meanwhile, 
as far as tax rate goes and ignoring assessment, eleven 
counties! appear to be making even greater financial 
sacrifice for their schools than Baltimore County; but the 
very counties that receive from the state the largest pro- 
portion of money spent on local schools, Calvert, Charles, 
and St. Mary’s, are the counties that have the lowest 
school tax. 
While there is, therefore, some reason for encourage- 
ment in the increasing local support of the schools, the 
fact cannot be ignored that the three counties receiving 
from the state from 60 to 70 per cent. of all the money 
locally available for education are the very counties that 
are doing the least for themselves; nor can it be over- 
looked that rich counties like Carroll, Howard, and Tal- 
bot are apparently content to rely upon the state for 40 
to 50 per cent. of their school expenditures. The moral 
is plain: the state cannot afford to dispense its school 
funds without requiring a minimum school levy on the 
part of the several counties. Even so, the situation 
will continue to be more or less chaotic, unless and until 
property is assessed upon an equitable and uniform basis. 
For no absolutely fair distribution of the state fund can 
be made unless the minimum rate upon which the state 
should insist is levied upon an assessed valuation that 
really means the same thing in every county.

       X. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE STATE 
ORGANIZATION 
HE defects in Maryland education to which we 
| have now drawn attention arise partly from 
inferior organization due to poor laws, partly 
from inferior personnel, as a result of low educational 
ideals. Let us admit at the outset that unless the people 
of Maryland effectually demand that their educational 
officers should be chosen on the ground of fitness, and 
that political influence be eliminated, the mere rewriting 
of the statutes will not work any miracles. The rewriting 
of the statutes is, however, desirable, because statutes 
can be so drawn as to assist the people of the state in 
making their will prevail. On this assumption, what 
alteration should be made in the statutes dealing with 
the State Department of Education? 
The State Board must be reconstituted, so as to remove 
it as far as possible from politics and so as to make it 
independent of the educational agents and institutions 
with which it may find itself called on to deal. We have 
already called attention to the conditions which consti- 
tute the political menace. At least two of the six ap- 
pointive members of the Board must be regarded as 
representatives of the party defeated in the last general 
155
-P-A-G-E-220
  
156 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
election; worse still, these appointments must be made 
“by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” 
Again, the Governor is an ex-officio member of the Board 
and as a rule its presiding officer. To remove the State 
Board as far as possible from politics, its members should 
be appointed without regard to parties for long terms— 
say seven years—confirmation by the Senate should be 
dispensed with, and the Governor should be deprived of 
membership. 
The Board should, we have further stipulated, be in- 
dependent of its own agents and of institutions with 
which it deals. For this reason, the State Superintend- 
ent, while privileged to attend its meetings and to par- 
ticipate in its deliberations, should not be a member of 
the State Board which he serves as secretary and 
executive officer. Persons connected with educational 
institutions likely to be at any time affected by actions 
of the State Board should be ineligible for appointment. 
For this suggestion there is also the additional reason that 
a State Board of Education should be essentially a lay 
body, whose members are chosen because of their interest 
in education and their knowledge of the temper and 
aspirations of the people. A body so constituted will 
not, of course, originate educational policies, decide 
technical educational questions, or supervise the schools. 
Theirs, as we have pointed out, is the privilege of repre- 
senting the people, through bringing the experience of the 
layman and the layman’s point of view to bear upon the 
policies proposed by their professional agents. It is,
-P-A-G-E-221
       STATE ORGANIZATION 157 
in short, the function of a State Board of Education, not 
to administer the schools, but to govern under the law, 
to legislate within its powers, and to pass judgment upon 
the efficiency of its paid officers. 
The functions of the Board thus reorganized should be 
more clearly formulated. The school laws of Maryland, 
like those of all states, are the product of frequent and 
fragmentary legislation, drawn by different persons at 
different times. They are therefore lacking in consist- 
ency. A power allotted to the Board in one instance is 
in the next given to the State Superintendent; and vice 
versa. Thus inspection and supervision duties are at 
times assigned to the Board, while legislative responsi- 
bilities are imposed upon the State Superintendent. 
For example, the State Board is authorized, as we have 
said, to grant life certificates; the State Superintendent 
to grant certificates to graduates of institutions outside 
of Maryland. The Board is empowered to approve the 
qualifications of regular high school teachers; the State 
Superintendent, of special high school teachers. The 
Board is required to pass upon the establishment of col- 
ored industrial schools, while the State Superintendent 
certifies to the controller the right of particular schools 
to receive state aid after they are established. 
The principle on which powers and duties should be 
allotted to the State Board and to the State Superin- 
tendent respectively is simple enough. Matters relating 
to government and legislation belong to the Board; 
everything having to do with the execution of the will of  
-P-A-G-E-222
   
   
         
   
                                
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND     158 
the Board, that is, with inspection, supervision, and 
administration belongs to the State Superintendent. 
To illustrate: a lay board cannot be expected to know 
enough about the technique of professional preparation 
to pass upon the qualification of regular high school 
teachers. It is, however, entirely within the Board’s 
scope to determine, with the assistance of the State Super- 
intendent, what these qualifications should be. But the 
responsibility of actually applying the standards set up 
is clearly a professional task, belonging to the State 
Superintendent. 
A thoroughgoing revision of both the school laws and 
the by-laws in strict uniformity with this principle would 
localize responsibility, facilitate the work of the State 
Superintendent, and free the Board from the necessity of 
taking up technical details. The resulting relation would 
be analogous to that existing between a board of directors 
and the manager of a business corporation. Like the 
board of directors, the State Board would establish 
controlling policies; then, like the business manager, the 
State Superintendent would be responsible for the con- 
duct of the schools in conformity with these policies. 
To complete the needed reorganization, the State 
Board of Education should appoint its own executive 
officer. A public service body cannot be fairly held 
responsible for a chief officer not of its own choosing. 
Besides, the appointment of the State Superintendent by 
the State Board of Education would remove the state 
superintendency one step farther from politics. 
         
-P-A-G-E-223
  STATE ORGANIZATION 159 
Finally, the State Board of Education should be em- 
powered, within the limits of its annual appropriation, to 
fix the salary of the State Superintendent of Schools as 
well as all the subordinates selected on his recommenda- 
tion and working under him. The Board supervises the 
expenditure of millions: can it not be trusted to regulate 
the pay of its own officers and clerks? 
In certain important respects, the powers of the Board 
need to be increased, in order that the purposes of exist- 
ing laws may be carried out. For example, the State 
Board is already authorized to remove county super- 
intendents for cause and to institute legal proceedings to 
thatend. There is need of a means of enforcement which 
can be applied more quickly and with less public agita- 
tion. Again, certain counties—Calvert, for example— 
do not pay salary enough to secure the full-time superin- 
tendent required by law; others—Dorchester, among 
them—employed non-certificated persons to teach, in 
defiance of law; Anne Arundel engages teachers who have 
not had the six weeks’ professional training required by 
the law of 1914. All these statutes are violated with 
impunity. They are in fact hardly more than counsels 
tendered by the state to the local authorities to be heeded 
or not, as the local authorities see fit. Meanwhile, the 
state pours its liberal contribution into the county treas- 
ury, regardless of whether the law is enforced or broken. 
Unquestionably, the State Board should be authorized in 
such cases to withhold the state appropriation until the 
laws are complied with.
-P-A-G-E-224
  160 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
We have repeatedly noted the absence of a uniform 
method of certificating teachers. There are, indeed, more 
standards than there are counties, since the State Board, 
the State Superintendent, and the county superintendents 
all participate. The State Board should be invested with 
full powers over the examination and certification of 
teachers, including county superintendents, supervisors, 
principals, and attendance officers. Conditions favor 
this uniform standard, for under the law, the same sala- 
ties are paid in most counties. Under this arrangement 
the examinations of elementary teachers would be held as 
now at stated intervals at the county seats of the respec- 
tive counties. The questions would be prepared and the 
answers read by the State Superintendent and his assist- 
ants, while the county superintendents would merely 
conduct the examinations and certify to the character of 
the applicants. The great mass of teachers would there- 
fore be in no way inconvenienced by the centralization 
of authority. 
A final suggestion deals with school buildings. Mary- 
land possesses a few school buildings as good as any to 
be found in the entire country. But whether a new 
building is well planned or not is now a matter of accident. 
The results have been pointed out in preceding chapters. 
To introduce system, where chance now rules, the State 
Board should receive the authority to prescribe regula 
tions governing the building of schoolhouses and the 
State Superintendent, as its executive officer, should be 
required, after examining plans and specifications, to

  STATE ORGANIZATION 161 
give written approval before building contracts become 
valid. 
In this, as in other respects, the State Board must act 
through its executive officer, the State Superintendent. 
But the resources at the disposal of the Superintendent, 
inadequate at present, need to be extended as well as 
specialized, if the office is to be made efficient. With 
his single assistant, the State Superintendent cannot now 
inspect and direct the high schools as the law expects; 
nor can he advise with local authorities in reference to 
their local problems—the school levy, new buildings, 
school statistics, the county course of study, the colored 
industrial schools, or the condition of public sentiment. 
At the very least, the Superintendent’s staff must be 
increased to include an assistant superintendent, to be 
in charge of the correspondence, publications, records, 
reports, educational statistics, and the audit of the ac- 
counts of the county school boards; a supervisor of high 
schools, charged with the supervision of state-aided high 
schools and the work of all other schools above the 
seventh grade; a supervisor of rural schools, who shall 
give his entire energies to helping teachers, superintend- 
ents, and interested communities work out a program of 
rural education adapted to the individual and collective 
needs of a state that is overwhelmingly rural in its popu- 
lation, industries, and interests; and a white supervisor 
of colored schools. The Superintendent should have a 
reasonable allowance for travelling and for clerical aid. 
The total annual cost of the office of the State Superin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  162 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
tendent will be thus increased from $7,700 to perhaps 
$20,000 a year. The increase is large, not because the 
proposed program is elaborate, but because the former 
basis was utterly inadequate. The expense of conducting 
the state department must be regarded as an overhead 
charge incurred for the purpose of getting better results 
from the state’s present school expenditure. Is it not 
economy to spend $20,000 in order that $1,500,000 raised 
by the state may be wisely rather than inefficiently used 
and that $3,500,000 raised locally may be more effec- 
tively expended? Moreover, the increased cost of the 
state department does not mean increased taxation or 
increased appropriations; for it is paid for, not by the 
state treasury, but by the school fund, and it is wisdom 
to make sure of an effective central administration if the 
counties do get a few hundred dollars less apiece. Even 
so, there need be no fear that the state department will 
be unduly strong. The counties retain their proper 
power and authority; the state department is simply 
enabled to codperate with them intelligently, and the 
state fund is, as it should be, the lever, by means of which 
the counties can be brought into line
-P-A-G-E-229
XI. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COUNTY 
ORGANIZATION 
tion must, as we have just said, be accompanied 
by a strengthened county educational organiza- 
tion. To this end three steps must be taken: the county 
school boards must be placed on an educational, instead 
of a political, basis; they must be made reasonably inde- 
pendent on the financial side; and they must be provided 
with an adequate professional staff. 
The county boards should represent local interest 
in education. Can such boards be constituted without 
regard to political considerations if appointments con- 
tinue to be made by the Governor? Certainly, politics 
will creep in, unless public sentiment is vigilant, intelli- 
gent, and determined. The present law should be so 
modified as to concentrate responsibility in the Governor, 
who should not be permitted to share his responsibility 
with the Senate. The Governor will thus be in position 
to make his educational appointments without deferring 
to political influences. Otherwise, with a change of admin- 
istration, Democrats will succeed Republicans, and vice 
versa, irrespective of past services or efficiency. 
County school boards in the next place must be given 
163 A STRENGTHENED State Department of Educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  164 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
a reasonable degree of financial freedom. Financial 
independence is needed not only to complete the libera- 
tion of the boards from county politics, but to put them 
in position to do their duty by the schools. There is not 
a county in the state, as previously pointed out, in which 
the schools have not suffered from unjustifiable lack of 
funds. So acute did the needs in five counties become— 
and among these are the largest and financially the 
strongest—Baltimore, Allegany, Frederick, Montgomery, 
and Prince George, that, as we have remarked, recourse 
was had to the General Assembly for legislation compel- 
ling financial action on the part of the county commis- 
sioners. If the largest and richest counties cannot wring 
from the county commissioners ample funds for the 
schools, boards of education in smaller and less wealthy 
counties must surely find themselves in an impossible 
position. 
It was never intended, if we read the law aright, that 
the county commissioners should really control school 
finances. They were expected simply to protect the tax- 
payer against waste, as is proved by the fact that the 
commissioners are required to levy the taxes, demanded 
by the County Board of Education, up to a certain limit. 
Beyond this limit, the county commissioners enjoy dis- 
cretion obviously meant to enable them to check extrava- 
gance, not to block progress. Unfortunately, the 
present mandatory rate that must be levied on the re- 
quest of the county educational authorities is entirely 
inadequate; so inadequate, that funds are insufficient
-P-A-G-E-231
COUNTY ORGANIZATION 165 
even when additional levies from 1 to 28 cents on $100 
are raised. The remedy must be sought in the first 
place in raising the mandatory limit. 
Just where the limit should be placed is not easy to 
determine. No county now raises more money than it 
ought. Hence the mandatory limit up to which county 
commissioners must act on the request of the school 
boards should approximate the highest rates now levied. 
Four counties now levy in excess of 40 cents on the $100: 
Garrett, 45 cents; Worcester, 44; Queen Anne and Alle- 
gany, 43. In view of the needs of the schools even in 
these counties, a mandatory maximum rate of 50 cents on 
the $100 for the state would not be excessive. It does 
not follow that this maximum will be requested unless 
it is needed or can be afforded. School boards are just 
as amenable to local considerations as other bodies. 
They are not likely to go faster than local sentiment ap- 
proves or local resources allow. 
Even then, a levy of 50 cents on $100 will not pay for 
new buildings: no feasible current levy could or should. 
A school building that has a life of twenty-five years or 
more should be paid for by the successive generations 
who use it—that is, by a bond issue. At present a bond 
issue for school building requires legislative action and 
therefore often involves log-rolling and politics. The 
state should have a general law permitting counties to 
issue bonds for the erection of buildings up to a fixed 
per cent. of the assessable property of the county, and 
also empowering them to hold a special election if this  
-P-A-G-E-232
    
166 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
amount is to be exceeded. Five per cent. is the usual 
maximum, but in Louisiana it is ro per cent., and in Vir- 
ginia, 18 per cent. 
If the suggestions just made should be written into the 
law, it would be possible for the counties to do their duty 
by the schools. Even then the counties might, of course, 
be recalcitrant. The remedy is easy. Maryland now 
distributes an unusually large sum in aid of education 
without requiring from the counties an adequate ‘quid 
pro quo.” In consequence, the counties that receive 
most do least. As a pre-condition to receiving any part 
of the state’s largess at all, every county should be re- 
quired first to make a fixed local minimum school levy. 
This minimum local levy ought not to be lower than the 
present average local levy for all the counties taken to- 
gether—viz., 34 cents on the $100. Even a minimum 
local levy of 34 cents would materially affect only eight 
counties. These are, however, the very counties that 
should be affected—rich counties like Carroll, Howard, 
Talbot, and Washington, because they are relying too 
much on the state; and poor counties like Anne Arundel, 
Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary’s, because they are doing 
too little for themselves. 
Let us assume that in the ways above mentioned 
local education is more effectively financed. Does it 
follow that more money will make better schools? 
Not necessarily. The present organization in most 
counties cannot really use to good purpose much larger 
sums than are now spent, If the supply of money is
-P-A-G-E-233
  COUNTY ORGANIZATION 167 
to be increased, steps must be taken to ensure its wise 
expenditure. 
The counties—we need hardly repeat that there are 
exceptions—need more competent educational leader- 
ship. No one should be eligible to a county superintend- 
ency unless he possesses definite professional qualifica- 
tions and teaching experience. The County Superintend- 
ent should be a college graduate who has had at least five 
years of actual experience in the elementary schools, and 
not less than one year of professional work in an approved 
university specializing in educational administration and 
supervision. His appointment should require the writ- 
ten approval of the State Superintendent. His tenure 
should be at least four and preferably six years; he should 
be chosen in the middle, not at the beginning, of the 
Governor’s term of office; his salary should not be per- 
mitted to fall below a given minimum, and the state 
should pay from the school fund one-half of any salary 
up to a certain sum. Progressive counties, like Alle- 
gany and Baltimore, will gladly pay more than the max- 
imum in which the state would share, in order to retain 
in their service able and experienced leaders. 
A County Superintendent who is thus qualified should 
bear full responsibility for the conduct of the schools in 
conformity with the state laws. He should have author- 
ity over the courses of study, the choice of text-books and 
school supplies, the grading of the schools, the examina- 
tion and promotion of pupils, and over the employment 
and the placing of teachers in the schools. Of especial 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  168 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
importance in Maryland is the point mentioned last. 
Politics and personal interest will not be eliminated from 
the schools of Maryland while County School Board 
members continue to be influential in the appointment of 
assistant teachers, and district trustees select the princi- 
pal teacher in their respective schools. Teachers and 
principals should be appointed by the County Board on 
nomination by the County Superintendent. The power 
of local trustees should be limited to filing written 
charges with the County Board, while the dismissal in 
each case should be made only on the recommendation 
of the Superintendent with the approval of the Board. 
Local pride and interest must indeed be cultivated; but 
it is believed that both are best conserved by whatever 
measures make for school efficiency. 
All but four counties in Maryland now suffer woefully 
from lack of supervision, though county school boards 
possess the power to provide the needed professional 
help, having been authorized in 1904, under limitations, 
to employ assistant superintendents and, in 1910, to en- 
gage a supervisor. Thus far five counties have chosen 
assistant superintendents, three of whom do the work of 
clerks, and only four have full-time supervisors. The 
employment of supervisors should cease to be permissive. 
Every county employing 1oo teachers or more should 
be required to have at least one supervisor, and counties 
should be permitted to have as many more as may be 
locally thought desirable. The state should guard 
1Two small counties each having less than 100 teachers should be al- 
lowed to join in employing a supervisor.   
-P-A-G-E-235
       COUNTY ORGANIZATION 
  169 
against incompetent supervision by prescribing minimum 
qualifications—viz., graduation from a standard normal 
school, three years of experience as a teacher in the 
elementary schools, and at least one year of special prep- 
aration beyond the normal in a reputable university. 
A salary commensurate with the importance of the 
service should be fixed by the state, half of it to be 
paid out of the school fund. As an additional safe- 
guard the appointment of supervisors should be invalid 
until approved in writing by the State Superintendent. 
Into schools improved as the schools of Maryland would 
be improved by such steps as have been above recom- 
mended, the children of the state must be regularly and 
continuously brought. School enrolment must be syn- 
onymous with school population; school attendance must 
approximate school enrolment. To this end the state 
requires a genuine—not an optional—compulsory attend- 
ance law, affecting all children between eight and fourteen 
years of age. But compulsory education does not en- 
force itself. Hence the employment of at least one 
attendance officer whose qualifications are certified to 
and whose appointment is approved by the State Super- 
intendent should be made mandatory upon the counties. 
To secure properly qualified persons for this important 
work, the state, sharing equally in the payment with the 
counties, should guarantee a minimum annual salary. 
Finally, in order that competent educational officials 
may do the work awaiting them, decent quarters and a 
fair amount of office help are necessary. The state should   
         
  
-P-A-G-E-236
  170 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
therefore require county boards of education to provide 
satisfactory office facilities, to employ adequate clerical 
assistance—never less than one stenographic and sta- 
tistical clerk—and to bear the expenses necessary to the 
performance of official duties. In case of failure, the 
State Board of Education should be authorized to with- 
hold the funds of the state. 
The suggestions made in the present and the preceding 
chapters are not counsels of perfection. They represent 
what, if it will, Maryland can easily do to improve its 
educational organization and to provide this improved 
‘organization with requisite facilities. Our suggestions 
need not go further. We need add nothing to what we 
have already said on such subjects as teacher training, 
courses of study, sanitation, etc. These are, to be sure, 
the really important problems; but they are problems 
which can be solved only by the educational leaders and 
the teachers of the state. Given qualified leaders work- 
ing under the fairly favorable conditions which our sug- 
gestions aim to procure, everything else that the schools 
of Maryland lack will come in its proper season. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  XII. FINANCIAL READJUSTMENTS 
HE changes proposed in the State Department 
| of Education and in the county school organiza- 
tion furnish additional reasons for adopting a 
new policy in the use and distribution of state school 
funds. 
Maryland has, as was pointed out, several different 
school funds, real or ‘“‘so-called.” These funds estab- 
lished at widely different times, and under radically 
different conditions, are all distributed in different ways. 
To derive the greatest benefit from the present liberal 
support Maryland as a state is giving to public education, 
some of these ‘so-called’? school funds should be abol- 
ished and the others combined into a single fund to be 
known as the General State School Fund. 
This policy involves the abolition of the Academic 
Fund and the Bank Stock Fund, and the discontinuance 
of special appropriations. In the case of special appro- 
priations, why should the entire state be taxed in order 
that a single academy may be singled out for a special 
gift, or in order that a particular town may be presented 
with a school building on exceptionally favorable terms? 
Again, the Academic Fund now bolsters up decrepit 
academies in the very shadow of the new and vigorous 
17
-P-A-G-E-238
172. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
state-aided high schools. Its abolition will save $26,000, 
and education will gain, not lose. The Bank Stock Fund, 
as has been pointed out, is held by the state in the name 
of nineteen counties. The entire amount, $278,000, 
should be paid over to the counties to be used in their 
discretion—perhaps for buildings. The road would 
thus be cleared for a single fund to be distributed on a 
scientific basis. 
Into this single or General State School Fund all the 
remaining items should be brought—(a) the return from 
the War Loan of 1812, now amounting to $229,000, the 
only productive school fund of the state, and (b) the Sur- 
plus Revenue Fund, the principal of which was spent, 
the state obligating itself, however, to provide forever an 
annual income of $34,069. The identity and the conti- 
nuity of the War Loan of 1812 and of the Surplus Revenue 
Fund! should, of course, be preserved. The consolida- 
tion of these funds would simplify the work of account- 
ing, and facilitate an equitable distribution of the state’s 
contribution to the counties. 
From this General State School Fund should come, in 
the first place, such sums as are needed for the reorgan- 
ized state and county organizations and for such lines of 
educational activity as the state desires to develop. The 
1The constitutional requirements could probably be met if legal provi- 
sion were made for raising the income on the Surplus Revenue Fund asa 
part of the state school tax, to be distributed according to the provisions 
controlling the distribution of the General State School Fund. Were this 
done, the Surplus Revenue Fund could be dropped from the current 
accounts.

preceding chapters have dealt so fully with these points 
that further discussion is needless. To only one point 
need special attention be called. 
Maryland adopted in 1896 the policy of furnishing 
free text-books; since which date it has apportioned to 
the counties and the city of Baltimore $150,000 annually, 
amounting in 1914 to 61 cents per child enrolled. 
This is a wise policy, though somewhat too narrowly 
conceived. The materials of instruction comprise more 
than text-books, and often a good teacher can do quite as 
well without text-books as without maps, illustrative 
matter, handwork and drawing materials, supplemen- 
tary readers, reference books, and the like. The law 
indeed provides that, after text-books have been pur- 
chased, any surplus remaining may be expended upon 
maps of Maryland and supplementary readers; in most 
counties, however, there is and can be no surplus. 
The sum originally provided was even at the time in- 
sufficient, and since then the enrolment has increased 
26,000, of whom 2,800 are high school pupils. In the 
very first year of the apportionment the counties spent 
on school supplies 8 cents per child and Baltimore City 
36 cents in excess of the amount received from the state; 
and in 1914 the average per child for the counties was 20 
cents and for Baltimore City 65 cents. 
This excess expenditure, naturally enough, is largely 
confined to a few of the prosperous counties, the majority 
spending no more than is received from the state. The 
average County Board of Education could scarcely be ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
174. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
pected to spend more. As a consequence, the supply 
of reference books and supplementary readers is, as a 
rule, woefully inadequate, and books are often dog-eared 
and unsanitary. In a number of counties there are few 
if any maps and no illustrative material at all; in more 
than half the counties objectionable slates are in use; in 
not to exceed three counties are handwork and drawing 
materials freely supplied. 
To furnish free text-books, including supplementary 
readers, reference books, school supplies, handwork, and 
drawing materials, in adequate quantities, the present 
apportionment of $150,000 should be materially in- 
creased.! So long as the materials of instruction supplied 
are as meagre as they now are in many of the counties, 
to expect teachers to do good work is like asking them 
“to make bricks without straw.” 
Deductions from the state school fund for special pur- 
poses have been made before now; hence, no new princi- 
ple is established by the foregoing recommendations. 
Nor will they, if heeded, seriously reduce the amount 
available for distribution. Indeed, in consequence of 
the recent increase of the school tax to 17 cents, the total 
next year would probably not fall much below the sum of 
$1,353,000, the amount distributed in 1914. In any 
event, the sum, whatever it is, will be more effective in 
connection with an improved organization than would 
a larger sum, without it, and it should be distributed, in 
1The average per-pupil cost in typical cities of from five to ten thousand 
is, for elementary pupils, $2.12, and for high school pupils, $4.90.

FINANCIAL READJUSTMENTS 175 
view of the special aid provided for high schools, so as to 
equalize elementary school advantages. 
In thus distributing the general school fund, three 
factors ought to be considered: (a) the school population 
between six and fourteen years of age, (b) school attend- 
arice, (c) the comparative wealth of the counties. For 
practical purposes, however, only the first two factors 
can at this moment be taken into consideration; for the 
counties do not at present assess property uniformly,! 
and until they do, it would be unjust to take from those 
that estimate their wealth justly in order to give to those 
that make an unfairly low return of their property. On 
the existing basis counties with a high rate of assessment 
would indeed be twice penalized: they would pay an un- 
due part of the state tax and they would receive a re- 
duced amount from the state. Hence the adoption of a 
thoroughly sound and equitable method of distributing 
state school funds will need to be delayed until such 
time as the method of assessment becomes uniform. 
Meanwhile, every county should be required to make a 
minimum levy, and no part of the state apportionment 
should be paid to a county that fails to comply with 
this requirement. It goes without saying that any county 
is free to raise more than the minimum fixed by law. 
There is no reason, however, why the precise portion 
of the general school fund due the several counties should 
not immediately be determined on the basis of the actual   
iReport of Commission for the Revision of the Taxation System 
OP. 13-15. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  176 PUBLIC EDUCATION IN MARYLAND 
school population between the ages of six and fourteen, 
and the aggregate school attendance. Children between 
six and fourteen represent the work to be done in the 
elementary schools; the aggregate days of attendance 
represent the part accomplished. If the state’s aid is 
. based on the school population between six and fourteen 
the state assists each county according to its elementary 
school burden; if it is modified according as these children 
come to school or not, the state makes of its aid—as it 
should—a powerful lever in the carrying out of a general 
policy. The adoption of this suggestion would not 
materially affect the amounts now received by the 
counties and the city of Baltimore, but it would stimu- 
late effort to get children in school and to keep them 
regular in attendance.

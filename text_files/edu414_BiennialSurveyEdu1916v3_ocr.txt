INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
The Biennial Survey of Education presents the statistics of prac- 
fically all the important school systems in the United States for 
1917-18. The various chapters in the volume have been previously 
printed as bulletins, as indicated below: 
Statistical Survey of Education, Bulletin No. 31, 1920. 
Statistics of State School Systems, Bulletin No. 11, 1920. 
Statistics of City School Systems, Bulletin No. 24, 1920. 
Statistics of Universities, Colleges, and Professional Schools, Bulletin No. 34, 1920, 
Statistics of Normal Schools, Bulletin No. 81, 1919. 
Nurse Training Schools, Bulletin No. 73, 1919. 
Summer Schools, Bulletin No. 31, 1919. 
Statistics of Public High Schools, Bulletin No. 19, 1920. 
Statistics of Private High Schools, Bulletin No. 3, 1920. 
Private Commercial and Business Schools, Bulletin No. 47, 1919. 
Industrial Schools for Delinquents, Bulletin No. 52, 1919. 
Schools for the Deaf, Bulletin No. 79, 1919. 
Schools for the Blind, Bulletin No. 78, 1919. . 
Schools and Classes for Feeble-Minded and Subnormal Children, Bulletin No. 70, 
1919. 
This plan of printing the different chapters in the report as separate 
bulletins permits a wider circulation of the statistics. By this 
arrangement it becomes unnecessary to send the whole volume to 
those desiring only the statistics of a given class of schools or in- 
stitutions. Several thousand copies of the volume, however, have 
been printed for the purpose of supplying libraries, colleges, univer- 
sities, etc., with a complete report more or less comparable to that 
issued in preceding years. : 
This chapter includes a general summary of the statistics, showing 
the enrollment in public and private schools and institutions of 
various types, the estimated cost of maintaining these schools for 
1917-18, the distribution of teachers among these schools and the 
estimated length of time the average person attends school during 
i

his life. In addition to these general statistics, this chapter contains 
certain information which had to be culled from other chapters in the 
report and assembled into a unified whole. Thus the statistics of 
rural schools have been secured by subtracting from the chapter on 
State school systems the corresponding amounts in the chapter on 
city school systems, and securing from these results certain relation- 
ships. To secure complete statistics for kindergartens, it Has been 
necessary to bring together corresponding data from reports of kinder- 
gardens maintained by cities, by villages, and by private organizations. 
Further, the enrollments in elementary, secondary, and higher in- 
stitutions of all types have been assembled to show the total school 
enrollment in each State and in the Nation. This chapter serves, 
therefore, the double purpose of summarizing and assembling such 
data as could not well be done in any other single chapter of the report.

TOTAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. 
Table 1 summarizes the figures which indicate the total enrollment 
in each type of school or institution. The statistics of schools in 
Alaska and of Government Indian schools have been taken from other 
Government reports. All other statistics contained in this summary 
have been derived from the succeeding chapters. These data have 
been organized to show facts regarding enrollment in public and pri- 
vate schools. The statistics of private elementary schools have 
been estimated very largely, but they are in all probability fairly 
dependable. The grand total enrollment in all types of schools is 
24,027,199. This aggregate imcludes 21,812,887 persons enrolled in 
public schools and 2,214,312 persons enrolled in private schools.
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Excluding all special and evening schools, the total enrollment in 
kindergarten, elementary, secondary, and higher institutions is 
23,029,062, including 21,105,590 persons registered in public schools 
and 1,923,472 persons enrolled in private schools. The further 
distribution of these aggregates among the different types of schools 
may be ascertained from the table. 
THE COST OF EDUCATION. 
Table 2 contains statistics showing the total cost of education in 
1917-18, the total enrollment in the institutions, and the average or 
per capita cost based on the total number of persons enrolled in the 
various types of schools. These annual per capita amounts do not 
always represent the same conditions. Thus the per capita expendi- 
tures in public elementary, secondary, and higher institutions usually 
do not include amounts spent for board or lodging, while the corre- 
sponding expenditures in private high schools and academies, in 
schools for the deaf, the blind, and the feeble-minded quite fre- 
quently include these extraneous-to-school costs. Caution should 
be used, therefore, in interpreting the per capita costs shown in 
Table 2. 
The total amount spent for education in 1917-18 in the schools 
represented in Table 2 was $1,059,934,803. The total enrollment in 
these schools (excluding city evening schools) was 23,433,726. The 
average per capita cost based on the total number attending school 
is, therefore, $45.23. This average, as has just been pointed out, 
needs to be used cautiously, since it often includes the cost of board 
and lodging. TEACHERS. 
In Table 3 the number of men and women teachers in the various 
types of schools have been assembled. The total number employed 
in 1917-18 was 769,763, including 153,641 men and 616,122 women. 
The men teachers constitute only 23 per cent of the total number. 
It is thus seen that over three-fourths of all teachers in the United 
States are women. In 1890 the corresponding percentage was almost 
36. From this table it is possible to ascertain where the loss of men 
teachers has been greatest, but this matter has been sufficiently 
discussed in succeeding chapters. 
GIFTS AND BEQUESTS TO EDUCATION. 
Table 4 shows the amount of gifts and bequests to education in 
1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1918. As no statistics were col- 
lected from schools in 1916-17, there are no corresponding data for 
that year. The total amount received from this source in 1918 was 
$29,856,568, which represents a considerable decrease as compared ~ 
with the corresponding data for 1916. As the war undoubtedly reduced 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
STATISTICAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1917-1918. 13 
this source of school support in 1918, it is not safe to estimate the 
amount received in 1917. 
In Table 5 the amount of gifts and bequests for each year since 
1870 has been assembled. Omitting the amounts received in 1882 
and 1917, the total amount accruing to the cause of education from 
this gratuitous support has been $677,393,176. This amount is 
not sufficient to maintain the public elementary and secondary 
schools of the Nation for one year. (The total amount required in 
1918 was $763,678,089.) This amount is equivalent to $32.48 for 
each pupil now enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools 
(20,853,516 pupils enrolled in 1918).

AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING. 
An attempt has been made to ascertain the amount of schooling 
received by the “average” person now completing a school course. 
The data showing the method of arriving at such an average are 
givenin Table 6. In Table 12 in the chapter on State School Systems ~ 
. the percentage of children enrolled in school at each age in 1910 is 
shown. These percentages are repeated in column 4 of Table 6 of 
this chapter. It is assumed that all children who are under 6 years 
of age and who are attending school are 5 years of age. There is prac- 
tically no fallacy in the results obtained in this way, although it is 
known that some children attend kindergarten at the age of 4, since 
the age groups of 4 and 5 essentially equal. It is found, therefore, 
that 19.5 per cent of the children 5 years of age, or an equivalent 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  14 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
thereof, are in school. Similarly for those over 20 years of age, it 
has been assumed that they are all 21 years of age. As the age 
groups just above 20 are essentially equal, it does not matter if all 
such persons are considered 21 years of age. 
This enables one to combine these scattered persons who are attend- 
ing school into workable percentages which for all purposes are 
reliably correct. It is assumed, therefore, that the average child 
entered school at the age of 5 in 1902 and attended school more or less 
irregularly until he was 21 years of age, in 1918. The average number 
of days attended by all pupils enrolled in school in 1902 was 101.7; 
in 1903, 102.1 days, etc., as shown in column 3 of the table. The 
“average’’ child 5 years of age attending school in 1902 went 101.7 
days. The following year this “average’”’ child went 102.1 days, ete. 
But it must be considered that only 19.5 per cent of the children 
5 years of age attend school and that only 52.1 per cent of those 
6 years of age attend school. Consequently, the “average” child 
in the population in 1902 received not over 19.8 days schooling at the 
age of 5 and not over 53.2 days schooling at the age of 6 in 1903. 
Proceeding as shown in the last column in Table 6 it is found that 
this “average” child gets the longest school term at the age of 12, 
when he attends 101.1 days. During his lifetime he will attend a 
total of 1,075.9 days, or an equivalent of 5.38 years of 200 actual 
school days each. 
At the age of 5 the complete expectation of life, as shown by the 
United States Life Tables in 1910, as prepared by James W. Glover 
for the Bureau of the Census, is 56.21 years of 365 days each. The 
“average’’ child as shown above attends school after this age only 
1,075.9 days, or an equivalent of 2.95 years of 365 days each. By 
comparing these figures it is found that this “‘average”’ child attends 
school only one-nineteenth of his life, subsequent to his fifth birthday. 
In other words only 1 day in 19 is spent in scholastic preparation 
for life. 
One error involved in the computation of column 5 of Table 6 
needs to be pointed out. The average number of days attended by 
each child enrolled in school as shown.in column 3 includes the num- 
ber of days attended by the older as well as the younger children. 
Possibly the younger children enrolled in school do not attend so 
regularly as the children coming within the compulsory attendance 
age limits. In other words, the ‘‘average’’ child attending school 
at 5 may not attend the average of 101.7 days, while at the age of 
12 he may attend more than the average of 112.6 days. As these 
errors are counterbalancing, and as the range of these averages is 
narrow, falling between 101.7 at 5 years and 121.2 at 18 years, no 
great vitiating factor can be discerned herein. It is held, therefore, 
that the method is essentially sound, and that the results secured
-P-A-G-E-15
STATISTICAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1917-1918. 15 
are reliable. The fact that it has been necessary to use the percent- 
age of persons attending school in 1910 does not materially operate 
in nullifying conclusions, since the school history of this average child 
centers around the year 1910, and since such minor errors as may 
exist are again compensating. 
MEN TEACHERS IN RURAL SCHOOLS. 
In cities having a population of 2,500 or over, 25,063 men and 
216,319 women teachers are employed. In rural schools (schools 
located in the open country and in villages) 80,164 men and 329,196 
women teachers are employed. From these figures shown in detail 
in Table 9, it is found that 10.4 per cent of the city teachers and 19.7 
per cent of the rural teachers are men. In all schools, both city and 
rural, 16.1 per cent of the teachers are men. The percentage of men 
teachers in the rural schools of each State is shown graphically in 
figure 1. Indiana, Arkansas, and West Virginia lead with relatively 
high percentages of men teachers, while Connecticut, Vermont, Ne- 
braska, and Colorado fall at the bottom of the list. The scarcity of 
men teachers in the rural schools in certain States should be suffi- 
cient to give great concern. Unless more remunerative salaries are 
paid in the rural schools, the exodus of practically all men teachers 
from these schools seems imminent. 
THE RURAL ‘AND CITY SCHOOL TERM. 
For the United States the average length of the school term in 
elementary and secondary schools combined is about 160 days. In 
the city schools the corresponding average is 182 days, while in the 
rural schools it is only 142 days. The children in the rural schools 
have a little over 7 months of school, while city children have over 
9 months. The city child has a school term 40 days longer than the 
child in the rural schools. Figure 2 and Table 8 present these facts 
for each State. In the figure the projection of the “pin’’ beyond 
the “bar” is very pronounced in the States falling in the lower half of 
the figure. Smaller differences prevail among States with respect to 
the length of the city school term than to that of the rural school 
term. The “pins” are more nearly equal in length than the “bars.” 
PART OF SCHOOL TERM NOT ATTENDED. 
The part of the school term lost by irregular attendanée is shown for 
rural and city schools in Table 8 and figure 3. In the lower part of 
the diagram the per cent of the school term lost in the rural schools 
is about twice that wasted im city schools. In many States near the 
top of the list the loss is about the same in both classes of schools. 
Oregon and Ohio are outstanding in the relatively small proportion 
of the rural school lost by irregular attendance. It should be noted

in this connection that the States have been arranged in the increas- 
ing order of the percentage of the rural school term lost. On this 
score Ohio and Oregon occupy the most commendable, and Kentucky 
and Rhode Island the most derogatory positions. As a general rule 
the city child loses 39 school days annually, or 21.4 per cent of the 
term provided, while the child in rural communities loses 42 days, or 
29.4 per cent of the school term provided for him. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES IN RURAL AND CITY SCHOOLS. 
In all elementary and secondary schools the average annual salary 
of teachers is $618. As shown in Table 10 the corresponding average 
in city schools is $854 and in rural schools $479. The variations from 
these average practices are best exhibited in figure 4. California, 
Arizona, and Washington head the list on the high salaries paid to 
rural teachers. Alabama, North Carolina, and Mississippi pay the 
lowest average salaries to rural teachers. Not infrequently the ay- 
erage salary paid to city teachers falls below the $600 line. The 
great inequality in the relative lengths of the “bars” and the “pins” 
in most of the States suggests the query as to whether the rural child 
is not entitled to as good a teacher as the city child. 
CITY AND RURAL SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
The estimated value of all school property and the average value 
for each pupil enrolled in school are shown for city and rural schools 
in Table 10. In city schools this per capita is found to be $146.69, 
while in rural schools it is only $60.81. For both combined it is 
$96.23. The deviations from these general averages are shown 
graphically by States in figure 5. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and 
Montana rank first on the values of property in the rural schools. In 
some States little difference exists between the average value in rural 
and city schools. In most States the “pins” project far beyond the 
“bars,” indicating that great inequality exists as to the “school 
home” provided for the rural and the city child. 
THE PER CAPITA COST OF RURAL AND CITY EDUCATION. 
" An attempt has been made to ascertain the annual cost of educa- 
tion in city and rural schools. The results are shown in Table 12. 
Some of the averages are not precise, as the various per capitas for 
city and rural schools had to be derived by a process of subtraction, 
as explained above. While the averages shown are not precise, 
they are nevertheless fairly dependable. In figure 6 the per capita 
cost for each pupil enrolled has been ascertained. The city schools 
on this basis spend $40.59, while the rural schools spend only $23.91 
for meeting the current expenses of each pupil. The States have 
been ranked on the magnitude of rural school costs. Montana,

Nevada, and New Hampshire rank first, and Tennessee, North Caro- 
lina, and Mississippi last in the array. Great differences - be- 
tween rural and city school expenditures are indicated by decided 
projections of the pins beyond the bars. The States seem to. fall 
into two well-defined groups in this diagram, the State of Maine 
serving as a dividing bar. Those above Maine spend over $33 per 
rural school pupil, and those below Maine spend less than $26 per 
pupil. 
It should be remembered that the per capitas presented in this 
graph relate only to current expenses and do not include amounts 
spent for new buildings, grounds, and new equipment. 
In figure 7 the average expenditures for education in rural 
and city schools have been computed on the basis of the number of 
pupils in average daily attendance. This method of computation 
eliminates from consideration the absence of pupils from schools and 
gives the actual annual cost for the average pupil who takes daily 
advantage of the school term provided him. On this basis the per 
capitas become considerably higher, for city schools $51.56, and for 
rural schools $33.85. Figure 7 shows these facts for the different 
States, ranking the States on the decreasing per capita costs. Ari- 
zona, Montana, and Nevada lead on rural-school expenditures, and 
Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee come last. In several 
States the average rural school expenditures exceed those incurred 
by city schools. 
As the length of the school term varies considerably in the differ- 
ent States, the average cost based on the average attendance will be 
comparatively low in States having a short school term and relatively 
high in States having a long school term. To eliminate this factor 
of inequality from consideration, it becomes necessary to divide the 
per capita costs pictured in figure 7 by the length of the school term 
in each State for city and rural schools respectively. The results of 
these corrections are shown in Table 10 and figure 8. The average 
daily cost in rural scliools ranges from 57 cents in Montana to 8 cents 
in Tennessee. The average for all rural schools is 24 cents per day, 
and for all city schools 28 cents. It becomes apparent from these 
figures that city and rural unit costs, for the same length of time, are 
not essentially different. These minor differences were magnified 
in the two preceding graphs, since the length of the school term had 
not been taken into consideration. This statement is not derogatory 
to figures 6 and 7, since they take into account the fact that the city 
child goes to school a greater number of days during the year than 
the rural child. It should also be remarked at this juncture that 
large city schools can be maintained at smaller unit expenditures 
than can small rural schools, most of which have only one room.

  26 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Where large numbers of children can be conveniently brought 
together the unit cost may not decrease but the educational ad- 
vantages accruing from the same cost can be increased. With equal 
per capita costs, the city schools should be superior to rural schools. 
The slight difference in the daily cost of maintaining city and rural 
schools, 28 cents and 24 cents respectively, do not, therefore, represent 
even approximate educational advantages, when all facts are con- 
sidered. From all of these analyses of current expenses it does not 
appear that the rural-school child is getting a “square deal.” He is 
working under a handicap so long as he remains in the rural schools. 
The movement for the consolidation of schools seems to offer the 
most satisfactory solution to this serious problem. 
In the preparation of figures 2 to 8 and of Tables 7, 8, 10, 11, and 
12, an attempt has been made to compare city and rural schools. 
To attain this end some of the data appearing in Chapters II and III 
had to be modified in order to secure the comparable data for city 
and rural schools, as shown in this chapter. Furthermore, the data 
presented in this chapter, containing certain corrections, are thought 
to be more nearly correct than the corresponding data appearing 
originally in Bulletin, 1920, No. 31. It was impossible to make all 
the necessary corrections in the statistics until the printed State 
school reports for 1918 had been received.

40 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ENROLLMENT IN ELEMENTARY, SECONDARY, AND HIGHER EDUCA- 
TIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 
In Tables 14, 15, and 16 the number of persons attending all 
elementary, secondary, and higher schools have been assembled 
from statistics contained in succeeding chapters. Certain significant 
percentages have been derived from these enrollment figures, as © 
shown in Table 13. From this table it is seen that 88.6 per cent of 
all persons attending school are enrolled in the elementary schools, 
9.3 per cent in the secondary schools, and 2.1 per cent in the higher 
institutions, such as universities, colleges, technological schools, pro- 
fessional schools, and normal schools. In Oregon 4.5 per cent of 
the whole number of pupils in school attendance are in higher insti- 
tutions. The corresponding percentage for the District of Columbia 
is 7.4. On the proportion of secondary students California ranks 
first with 20.6 per cent. 
In the elementary schools 92.8 per cent of the pupils are enrolled 
in the public schools. In the secondary schools 90.9 per cent of all 
students are registered in public schools. In higher institutions 
only 52.2 per cent of the students come under the influence of insti- 
tutions under public control. From these relationships it is apparent 
that the private-school factor is most pronounced in our institutions 
of higher education. In the chapter on high schools the decreasing 
importance of private high schools has been pointed out. In the 
chapter on universities, colleges, and professional schools the rela- 
tively static nature of higher institutions under private control has 
been demonstrated over a period of years by means of an index 
curve showing comparative rates of increase. 
It is significant to compare the States on the proportion of the 
total population enrolled in school. These percentages are shown 
numerically in Table 13 and magnitudinally in figure 9. It is seen 
from the diagram that Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee 
have the largest percentages of the total population enrolled in the 
school. In preceding similar statistical reports of the Bureau of 
Education it has been shown that the proportion of children in the 
Southern States is exceedingly high. This fact means that an 
unusually large proportion of the population is of school age and is 
presumably attending school. These facts are suggested as a 
plausible explanation of the high ranking of these three States on 
this point. Nevada, with a comparatively large adult population, 
has relatively few children to attend school, and therefore ranks 
low on the chart. These facts suggest an explanation as to why 
Southern States usually take low rank when any attempt is made 
to rate the States. From this figure it is seen that 21.8 per cent 
of the population attends school at some time during the year, 19.4 
per cent in the elementary schools, 2 per cent in the high schools, 
and 0.4 per cent in higher educational institutions.

48 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  KINDERGARTENS. 
The statistics of all kindergartens reporting to the Bureau of Educa- 
tion have been summarized in Tables 17-22, inclusive. The statistics 
of all kindergartens in cities of 2,500 population and over were col- 
lected with other city school statistics and have been shown in detail 
for cities of 10,000 population and over in the chapter on city school 
systems. The public school kindergarten statistics in villages, i. e., 
in places having a population less than 2,500 in 1910, are not shown 
in detail in this report. Only the summary is shown herewith. The 
statistics of private kindergartens have not been printed in detail in 
the report. Table 22 presents the summary of these 890 reports. 
In figure 10 the percentage of children of kindergarten age who are 
enrolled in kindergartens has been pictured by States. It has 
been assumed that the total number of children 4 and 5 years 
of age, inclusive, in the various States represents the number 
of children of kindergarten age. In the diagram it is seen 
that the District of Columbia ranks first, with over 35 per cent of 
its children of these ages in kindergartens. A revision of the 
census estimates in 1920 will undoubtedly show that this proportion 
is too high. California, New York, and New Jersey come next in 
the order named. In eight States over one-fifth of these children 
are in kindergartens. In the whole country only 10.5 per cent of 
the children of these ages are enrolled in kindergartens. 
Figure 11 shows the average length of the school term in public 
and private kindergartens, combined. Remarkable uniformity pre- 
vails in the length of the kindergarten school term. The average 
term is 183 days. In all States, but one, the average exceeds 160 
days. This uniformity in the length of the school term seems to 
imply that kindergartens are characteristic of cities rather than of 
rural districts, which often have a relatively short school term. 
The great waste of the school term in kindergartens is appalling 
to the uninitiated. As shown in figure 12, in eight States the children 
attend less than one-half the school term provided. In nearly all the 
States the loss is over 30 per cent. The average for all States is 46 | 
per cent. Several reasons account for this apparently great waste. 
Oftentimes all city school buildings for elementary schools do not 
have kindergartens. This lack of kindergarten facilities means that 
the children who do not attend are often obliged to go longer dis- 
tances to school than such small children should go. The distance 
factor, therefore, operates to reduce attendance. During these 
early years the child comes into contact with many communicable 
children’s diseases when‘at school. His previous home life has been 
more or less restricted, but now he is exposed to any disease brought 
to school. The loss of a few weeks through sickness may mean that

the child will not return to school again that year. At this early 
age no compulsory attendance law operates to bring the child back to 
school. In view of these reasons, a high degree of regularity of attend- 
ance is not to be expected of such small children. 
As shown in Table 17, the average number of pupils to a teacher is 
48. Considering the fact that 46 per cent of the children enrolled in 
kindergartens do not attend, it is found that the average number of 
pupils actually present each day to each teacher is only 22. It is 
evident, therefore, that the teaching load in kindergartens is not 
very heavy. Considerable variation from the general average pre- 
vails, one State (Illinois) having as many as 80 pupils to a teacher, 
and another (Vermont) having only 20. In considering kinder- 
garten statistics, it should be observed that in States having very 
small percentages of pupils in kindergartens, the averages, as shown 
in Table 17, often exhibit characteristics of a few individual schools 
and not generalities. Due regard should, therefore, be given to the 
number of pupils enrolled in kindergartens in judging the percentages 
as shown.

SCHOOLS REPRESENTED. 
The statistics found in this report on State school systems relate 
solely to the public elementary and secondary schools. In no case 
have the statistics of standard colleges, universities, and professional 
schools been included. The information contained herein has been 
supplied by the various State offices of education. It has been 
found necessary in several instances to supplement the reports from 
other sources and to make estimates for information not supplied by 
or not available in the State office. No attempt has been made to 
separate the financial statistics of elementary and secondary schools, 
in case the State office did not do so. In fact the data furnished have 
not warranted any very accurate deductions regarding the cost of 
elementary and secondary schools. The statistics reported, however, 
have been included. It is hoped that in the future the statistics of 
elementary and secondary schools may be kept wholly separate and 
distinct, as has now been practically agreed upon by every State 
office. 
This chapter includes the statistics of city, village, and rural 
schools combined. It should be added that it is possible in many 
cases to obtain rural school statistics from this chapter, by subtracting 
from the totals given herein the corresponding numbers found in the 
chapter on city school systems. 
The only statistics of private schools included herein relate to the 
enrollment in private elementary and secondary schools. Wherever 
such data have been used, their inclusion has been definitely indicated. 
The statistics in this chapter include both white and colored 
pupils. In a few tables the statistics of schools for white and for 
colored children have been treated separately. 
The statistics of our outlying possessions have been given in so far 
as reported, but have not been included in the totals for the conti- 
nental United States, nor have they been used in any of the graphic 
studies which follow.

  56 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
By reference to Table 1 it is found that 19.81 per cent of the 
estimated total population is enrolled in school. In other words, 
almost one-fifth of the total population is enrolled in the public 
elementary and secondary schools. As will be noted in figure 1, the 
highest percentage of the total population was enrolled in 1895. 
Since that date the percentage has decreased, except in 1918, when a 
slight rise is evident. The percentage has not shown any very great 
variation from the 20 per cent line at any date represented. The 
slight decrease since 1900 has not been due to a smaller percentage of 
children enrolling in school, but to the decreasing percentage of 
children in the total population as shown in Table 1, where the ratio 
has decreased from 31.3 per cent in 1870 to 26.4 per cent in 1910. 
It is shown in figure 1 that the percentage of children 5 to 18 years 
of age who are attending school has increased gradually since 1870, 
except in 1905. The gradual rise in the dotted curve in figure 1 
shows that the schools are enrolling an increasing percentage of the 
total school population. 
A further commendable condition is apparent in figure 1, in that the 
children who do enroll in school attend more regularly in recent years 
than they did several decades ago. In 1870 fewer than 60 out of 
each 100 pupils enrolled attended school each day, while in 1915 over 76 
pupils in 100 enrolled attended each day the schools were in session. 
The slight falling off in school attendance in 1918 is undoubtedly due 
to the war, since unusual opportunities were afforded for increasing 
school delinquency. The increase in the percentage of school attend- 
ance is probably due in a large measure to the more effectiveness of 
our compulsory attendance laws, which not only cause more children 
to attend school, but also compel more regular attendance on the part 
of those who enroll. Better teaching, better supervision, a more 
suitable course of study, transportation of pupils, and improved 
conditions in general also tend to produce this commendable tendency. 
The gradual rise of these two curves is unmistakable evidence that 
our school systems are getting better. There is still room for improve- 
ment, however, as about one-fourth of the children of school age are 
still out of the public schools, and only three children out of every 
four enrolled attend daily. 
CHILDREN IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL. 
When the number of children enrolled in private and parochial 
schools is considered, it is found that an additional 6.9 per cent of the 
children 5 to 18 years of age are enrolled in such schools. This means 
that only 17.8 per cent of the children of school age are not enrolled 
in either public or private elementary and secondary schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 57 
An inspection of figure 2 shows that four States and the District of 
Columbia have more pupils enrolled in public and private schools 
than there are children 5 to 18 years of age. This apparent incon- 
sistency is probably explained by the fact that there has been a 
greater influx of population to Montana, Arizona, California, Washing- 
ton, and the District of Columbia than census estimates based on 1910 
can take account of. Figure 2 shows the number of children enrolled

shown that 10 States have over 10 per cent of the children of school 
age enrolled in private and parochial schools. New Hampshire and 
the District of Columbia have over 20 per cent of the children of 
school age enrolled in such schools. Two States, Montana and 
Arizona, have more children enrolled in the public schools than there 
are children between the ages of 5 and 18. Twenty States have over

one-fifth of the children of school age out of school. This condition 
may signify that a more effective compulsory attendance law should 
be enacted by these States. In one State, Louisiana, 40 per cent of 
the children are not enrolled in school. In figure 2 the States are 
ranked on the total percentage of children in public and private 
schools. 
ENROLLMENT IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
With the widespread influence of the modern secondary school alarger 
and larger percentagé of the total school population is being enrolled 
in high school. It is of interest, therefore, to measure this increase. 
In 1918 there were enrolled 1,933,821 students in the public secondary 
schools of the country. This number is 9.3 per cent of the 20,853,516 
pupils enrolled in the public schools. It should be remarked in this 
connection that the number of students in high schools, just given, is 
the number of such students reported by the State offices of educa- 
tion, and presumably is correct. The special chapter on high schools, 
prepared by the Bureau of Education in 1918, shows an enrollment 
of 1,645,171 students, but reports were not received from all of the 
high schools in the United States. This number, however, is 7.9 per 
cent of the total enrollment in both types of schools, and is more 
comparable to the other percentages which are given in Table 1, and 
which have been ascertained in like manner. In Table 1 it is shown 
that the percentage of pupils enrolled in high school in 1870 was only 
1.2 per cent of the total school enrollment. This percentage has 
increased gradually since that date to 1.4 per cent in 1885, 2.5 per 
cent in 1895, 4.1 per cent in 1905, and 6.7 per cent in 1915. 
While these percentages indicate an upward tendency for the whole 
United States, considerable diversity exists among the States with 
respect to the percentage of pupils enrolled in high schools. By 
reference to figure 3, it will be noted that the percentage decreases 
from 19. in California to 2.2 in South Carolina. In other words, 
California has almost nine times as great a proportion of children in 
high schools as South Carolina. New Hampshire ranks second with 
a percentage of 18.1, and Massachusetts third with a percentage of 
17.2. The striking inequality in these percentages for the various 
States indicates that secondary education is still a minor factor in a 
large number of States. 
LENGTH OF THE SCHOOL TERM. 
The average length of the school term provided in the different 
States is shown in figure 4. It should be distinctly understood that 
the averages given do not apply to all the pupils attending school in 
the respective States. For instance, cities usually provide a school 
term of at least nine months, while many rural schools in the poorer

  districts often are in session only a very few months in the year. 
The averages given, however, represent tendencies and point out in 
no unmistakable way the different levels to which the States have 
risen in the matter of providing for the education of all their children. 
The map shows that 6 States have an average term of 180 days or 
over and 23 States a term of 161 to 180 days. Ten States have an 
average term less than 7 months. The average term provided in the 
United States is 160.7 days. Since the population of the United 
States is unequally distributed, one is likely to gain an erroneous 
impression as to the percentage of children represented by the different 
shaded areas. To rectify any such false impression, the corner graph 
has been inserted to show just how many pupils are to be found in the 
different shaded areas. Thus, almost 9 millions of children attend 
school in the States which have been ‘‘concreted’’ or ‘‘dotted,” 
almost 5 millions in the single-hatched area, ete. Almost 5 millions 
of children live in States where the average term is 7 months or less. 
Only 3 millions live in States where the average term is over 180 days. 
While figure 4 shows the length of school term provided, it does 
not show how many days each pupil attends. A better measure, 
therefore, of the amount of schooling actually given in each State is 
shown in figure 5. It is found that the average child enrolled in 
school in the United States attends a little less than 120 days per 
year. In 10 States the children enrolled attend 141 days or more, 
while in 14 States the average term attended is less than 100 days. 
In other words, over 6 millions of children attend school on an average 
less than 5 months each year. 5 
PART OF SCHOOL FERM WASTED, 
From figures 4 and 5, it is possible to ascertain the average part 
of the school term not attended. For instance, Indiana provides 
an average school term of 155 days, but the pupils enrolled attend 
only 144 days. The days not attended by each pupil enrolled average 
11. In other words, during 7.1 per cent of the time the schools are 
in session the children do not attend. In short, 7.1 per cent of the 
school term is wasted. 
As will be observed from figure 6, this is a comparatively small per- 
centage of loss: At the other extreme of the array of States, it is 
found that Kentucky wastes 41.1 per cent of its school term. “The 
corresponding average for the United States is 25.4 per cent. To 
express this average for the United States more clearly, one child 
out of every four enrolled in school will be absent each day the schools 
are in session. We are still wasting one-fourth of the school term by 
irregular attendance. Herein lies the proof of the effectiveness of a 
State’s compulsory attendance law. A good attendance law, rigidly

enforced in every State, undovbtedly would reduce this enormous 
waste due to irregular attendance. 
An attempt has been made in figure 7 to show what this loss means 
to each State in dollars. Of course the larger States will incur the 
greater financial loss, and for this reason the States have not been 
ranked, but placed in alphabetical order. Alabama fails to take 
advantage of 40.6 per cent of its school term, for the maintenance of 
which it spends $6,066,204, as shown in Table 56. It spends, there- 
fore, $2,462,879 for the maintenance of schools which the children 
do not attend. This loss, however, is partly theoretical, since the 
children who do attend may derive greater benefit from the school 
work than they would if the schools were crowded to their maximum 
capacity. New York spends almost 18 millions of dollars for educat- 
ing children who are absent from school; Pennsylvania, over 13 
millions; and California almost 10 millions. Altogether, the United 
States wastes over 190 millions of dollars annually for teaching: 
children who are out of school. 
The loss due to irregular and to nonattendance is not now so great 
as it has been in the past. From figure 8 it will be observed that the 
pupils enrolled attend more regularly than was the practice 30 or 40 
years ago and that a larger percentage of the total number of children 
of school age are found in the public school. The upper curve in 
figure 8 represents the average school term provided at the different 
quinquennial periods. The dotted curve shows the average number 
of days attended by the pupils enrolled. The lower curve gives the 
average number of days attended by each person of school age, i. e., 
from 5 to 18 years. The dark area shows the waste due to irregular 
attendance and the concreted area the loss of time due to the non- 
attendance of persons of school age. The combined areas represent 
the part of our school term wasted by children who should be in 
attendance. i 
In 1870 the children enrolled attended school only 78 days out of 
the 132 days provided. In other words the average pupil was absent 
from school 54 days, or 41 per cent of the time the schools were in 
session. In 1918 the average pupil lost only 40 days, or 25 per cent 
of the 160 days of schooling provided. Irregular attendance has 
been reduced, therefore, from 41 per cent to 25 per cent within this 
period of almost half a century. If the actual attendance of children 
of school age is considered, it is found that the average child in- 1870 
attended only 45 out of the 132 days of school provided. This 
means a loss of 87 days of schooling during the year, or almost two- 
thirds of the school term. In 1918 the average child of school age 
attended 90 days out of the 160 days of schooling provided. The 
loss, therefore, is 70 days, or almost 44 per cent of the average school

term. The wasté within these five decades has been reduced from 
66 to 44 per cent. 
This general tendency in reducing the waste in our public-school 
system is clearly shown by means of the corresponding index curves 
in the supplemental figure in the corner of the larger one. The 
index curve representing the school term has a more gradual slope 
than that representing the days attended by pupils enrolled or that 
representing the average number of days attended by each child of 
school age. These curves imply that, as the length of the school 
term has increased, the percentage of pupils attending daily has been 
accelerated at a more rapid rate, and the relative number of days 
attended by all children of school age has advanced at a still more 
rapid rate. These curves show very clearly that our schools are 
reaching an increasing percentage of children of school age and that 
the attendance is becoming more regular from year to year. Without 
doubt this condition has been brought about largely by the increasing 
effectiveness of compulsory attendance laws. 
It should be pointed out that this figure does not take into account 
children who attend private and parochial schools. The dark area, 
however, would not be affected by this consideration, since it deals 
wholly with the irregularity of attendance of pupils enrolled in the 
public schools. If the 1,915,125 children enrolled in private schools 
are deducted from the estimated number of children 5 to 18 years of 
age (27,686,476), the remainder (25,771,351) indicates the number of 
children of school age who should be enrolled in the public schools. 
The total number of days attended by these children was 2,498,424,309, 
or an average of almost 97 days each. This average of 97 days is 7 
greater than the average for 1918 given in the graph. Corresponding 
corrections should be made for each preceding period represented, 
but unfortunately the data necessary for such a series of computa- 
tions are not available. Furthermore, the number of children 
attending private schools has been largely estimated, thereby reducing 
the reliability of such computations. There is good reason to believe 
that from one-fourth to one-third of the children of school age who 
are not attending the public schools are attending private or parochial 
schools. Consequently the concreted area exaggerates the non- 
attendance of children of school age to this extent. In other words, 
about one-fourth to one-third of the concreted area of the graph 
should be eliminated if a true conception of absence from school is 
desired. As the graph stands it represents the public-school system 
only. It shows the extent to which the public-school term is utilized. 
The relative magnitude of the shaded and open areas is almost 
astounding.

ENROLLMENT OF TEN MILLIONS OF PUPILS BY GRADES. 
All States were asked in a special inquiry to furnish the enrollment 
by grades for all elementary and secondary schools. 
made such a report. Only 23 States 
Seventeen of these States have eight grades in 
the elementary schools, four States, seven grades; and two States, 
nine grades. Each State has four grades in the secondary schools. 
The enrollment by grades has, therefore, been classified in accord- 
ance with these plans, as shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4 and in figure 9.

  79 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
In Tables 2, 3, and 4, two series of percentages have been com- 
puted—the first to show the proportion of all children attending 
. School who are enrolled in each grade, the second to show, separately, 
the proportion of children attending the elementary school who are 
enrolled in each grade and also the percentage distribution of high- 
school enrollment by grades. From the former series of percentages 
the three parts of figure 9 have been constructed. The first two parts 
of this figure contain three curves each, one for white and colored 
children combined and the other two for white and colored separately. 
Two outstanding features are evident. First, the proportion of 
colored children in the lower grades greatly exceeds the proportion of 
white children, while in the upper grades the proportion of white 
children greatly exceeds the proportion of colored children. Second, 
the proportion of all children in the first grade is strikingly large. 
In States having the 7-4 plan of organization the proportion in the 
first grade (27 per cent) is higher than it is (19 per cent) in States 
having the 8-4 plan. In the two States having the 9-4 plan the per- 
centage in the first grade is scarcely larger than the percentage in the 
second, third, and fourth grades. This unusual aggregation of pupils 
in the first grade points unmistakably to the fact that it must contain 
a very large percentage of retarded pupils—pupils who are repeating: 
the work of the first grade. 
Only a very small percentage of colored pupils ever reach the first 
year of high school, as shown by the tendency of the dotted curves 
to “run aground” beyond the elementary grades. 
In States having the 8-4 plan almost 10 per cent of the pupils are 
enrolled in high school. In States having the 7-4 plan a little over 
7 per cent of the pupils are registered in high school. In States hay- 
ing the 9-4 plan over 14 per cent of the pupils are enrolled in high 
school. 
In States having the 7-4 plan almost a negligible percentage of 
children are enrolled in kindergartens, indicating that few kinder- 
gartens exist in these States. In States having the 8-4 plan over 
2 per cent of the total enrollment is found in kindergartens. In 
States having the 9-4 plan almost 6 per cent is found in this grade. 
(As Maine included all ungraded pupils with kindergarten pupils this 
percentage is probably too high.) The small proportion of pupils 
in the ninth grade in States having the 9-4 plan indicates that not 
all the schools within these States offer the ninth-grade work. Its 
discontinuation is foreshadowed. 
ENROLLMENT BY YEARS OF ADVANCEMENT. 
It is impossible to combine the three groups of States shown in 
figure 9, since the second group does not have the eighth grade and 
since the last group has a ninth grade elementary. An approxima- |
-P-A-G-E-73
  
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 73 
tion can be made, however, by eliminating the ninth grade elementary 
from consideration and by considering the first year of high school in 
States having the 7-4 plan as the eighth year in school, the second 
year of high school as the first, the third as the second, and the fourth 
as the third. This plan is defective to the extent that a smaller per- 
centage of pupils is left for the twelfth grade than is actually enrolled 
in this grade.

Table 5 shows the classification for white and for colored children 
separately and for white and colored combined. It is found that 
over 21 per cent of all pupils are in the first grade and that only a 
little over 1 per cent have attended school for 12 years. If the white 
pupils only are considered, it is found that less than 20 per cent are 
enrolled in the first grade and 1.23 per cent have attended school for 
12 years, or its equivalent. Considering only the colored pupils, it 
is found that over one-third of them (36 per cent) are enrolled in the 
first grade, and that only a negligible percentage (0.04 per cent) of 
them are found in the twelfth year. In fact, only 1 colored pupil in 
1,000 enrolled will be found in the eleventh year.

third and fourth year *high- -school pupils in Texas, which has the 7-4 plan of oeanleadn, 
Ninth grade elementary pupilsin Maine have hot been included in this table.   
Of the 23 States reporting enrollment by grades, only 9 gave the 
distribution by sex. The results have been summarized in Table 6 
and shown graphically in figure 10. In the lower grades, for both 
white and colored pupils, a larger percentage of boys than girls is 
shown, while in the upper grades a larger percentage of girls than 
boys is to be found. This condition probably indicates that the 
retardation of boys in the lower grades is greater than that of girls 
and that the school mortality among boys in the upper grades is 
greater than that for girls. It will be noted that there is only a very 
slight drop between the seventh and eighth grades for white girls, 
clearly indicating that girls remain in the elementary grades until 
they graduate. The tendency for boys to remain to complete the 
eighth grade is not so pronounced but is evident. In high schools 
there is a decidedly larger percentage of girls than boys, the ratio 
being approximately the same in each year. 
  THE EFFECT OF KINDERGARTENS ON GRADE DISTRIBUTION. 
In Table 7 the States have been classified into two groups showing 
separately the 7 States having an appreciable percentage of children 
enrolled in kindergartens and the 14 States which have very few or 
no kindergarten pupils. The grade distribution for Maine and 
Florida has not been used because in Maine ‘‘ungraded’ pupiis were 
reported as kindergarten pupils, and in Florida the pupils ‘in chart”

  76 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
were reported as kindergarten pupils. In columns 4 and 7 of Table 7 
the kindergarten pupils and all postgraduate high-school and junior 
college students have been eliminated from consideration, and the 
percentages for the remaining enrollment have been computed for 
each grade. These percentages, totaling 100, have been used in plot- 
ting the curves in figure 11. An inspection of this figure shows that 
in States having few or no kindergartens over 25 per cent of the 
enrollment in the 12 grades is found in the first, while the correspond- 
ing percentage in States having kindergarten pupils is only a little 
over 15 per cent. It is doubtful if this great reduction in the per- 
centage of retardation in the first grade is due wholly to the effect of 
kindergartens. In the upper grades the magnitude of the corre- 
sponding percentages is reversed, indicating that the 17 States having 
few or no kindergartens have also relatively small percentages of 
pupils in high school. On an average the educational status of these 
17 States is not so high as that for the 7 States having kindergartens. 
This higher average status would mean undoubtedly better teaching, 
thereby tending to reduce the percentage of retardation in the lower 
grades. It is clearly evident that by means of kindergartens and 
better teaching the usual retardation in the first grade can be largely 
eliminated. .

To ascertain even an approximate school mortality rate a series of

pared.) 
Each beginning class is larger than the one which preceded it, since 
the number of children in the population increases from year to year. 
In the following study the factors immigration, duplication, and 
retardation, which tend to exaggerate the enrollment reported, and 
the factors of staying out of school, private school enrollment, and 
death, which tend to reduce public school enrollment, have all re- 
ceived consideration.

  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 79 
The distribution of enrollment by grades was taken in 1911, just 
eight years ago. It was shown at that time that 23.5 per cent of the 
elementary pupils were in the first grade, 14.8 per cent in the second 
grade, 13.9 per cent in the third grade, 13.3 per cent in the fourth 
grade, 11.3 per cent in the fifth grade, 9.2 per cent in the sixth grade, 
7.6 per cent in the seventh grade, and 6.4 per cent in the eighth 
grade. The high-school pupils were distributed as follows: 42.8 per 
cent in the first year, 26.7 per cent in the second year, 18 per cent in 
the third year, and 12.5 per cent in the fourth year. No pupils were 
reported in kindergarten or in postgraduate high school at that time. 
To secure comparable percentages for 1918, the States having only 
seven grades have not been considered. The ninth-grade elementary 
has also been omitted from consideration. In 1918, 2.71 per cent of 
all pupils were enrolled in kindergartens, postgraduate high schools, 
or junior colleges. Making the proper deductions for this factor, it 
is found that in 17 States the percentage of all elementary pupils 
enrolled in first grade is 22.2 per cent; in the second grade, 13.9 per 
cent; in the third grade, 13.5 per cent; in the fourth grade, 13.1 per 
cent; in the fifth grade, 11.5 per cent; in the sixth grade, 10.1 per 
cent; in the seventh grade, 8.2 per cent; and in the eighth grade, 7.5 
per cent. From the special report on public high schools for 1918, 
which includes returns from all the States, it is found that 39.8 per 
cent of the students are enrolled in the first year, 26.9 per cent in the 
second year, 18.8 per cent in the third year, and 14.5 per cent in the 
fourth year. It will be noticed that the percentage of children in the 
first grade and in the first year of high school has diminished, and 
that the percentage in the eighth grade and in the fourth year of high 
school has increased since 1911. These changes in grade distribution - 
have not taken place suddenly, but gradually, within this 8-year 
period. In Table 8 aseries of corresponding intermediate percentages 
have been computed for the years 1912 to 1917, inclusive, for the 
elementary grades. The percentages for the high-school distribu- 
tion have been taken from the annual reports on public high schools 
made directly to this bureau. 
After deducting the estimated number of children enrolled in kin- 
dergartens and in postgraduate high schools from the total school 
enrollment for the various years, the remaining numbers are dis- 
tributed between the elementary and secondary grades. The num- 
ber of secondary students reported directly to the Bureau of Edu- 
cation by the public high schools varies from 984,677 in 1911 to 
1,645,171 in 1918. In 1918 the State offices for the first time re- 
ported 1,933,821 secondary students, or 1.175 times the number re- 
ported directly to this bureau. Assuming that in preceding years the 
number reported was correspondingly short and applying this ratio, 
an estimated true number of high-school students had been ascer- 
tained. All other pupils are enrolled in the elementary grades. The

“THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,” 
The method used in securing the survival percentages exhibited in 
figure 12 is explained in Tables 9 and 10. Similar survival percentages 
can be computed for classes entering school in other years than 1907. 
As it is difficult to ascertain the number of survivors in each lower 
grade, this computation omits the first four grades from consideration. 
From the survival percentages obtained it is found that only 86 per 
cent of the beginning pupils reach the fifth grade; 73 per cent the sixth 
grade; almost 64 per cent the seventh grade; about 58 per cent the 
eighth grade; nearly 32 per cent the first year of high school; 23 per 
cent the second; almost 17 per cent the third, and over 14 per cent 
the fourth year of high school on schedule time. A little over 13 per 
cent of the number entering the elementary school in 1907 will 
remain to graduate from a four-year high-school course in 1918. 
Slightly higher survival percentages obtain if the factor of retarda- 
tion is not considered, thereby showing approximately the number 
eventually reaching each grade. 
These percentages are significant, since they show the holding power 
of the public schools and indicate just what percentage of children 
is now reaching the different educational levels. 
CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AT THE VARIOUS AGES. 
It is of interest to know what per cent of children of each age is 
not attending school. The Bureau of Education collects no data on 
this phase of school attendance, as the Bureau of Census gathers this 
information decennially. 3 
Table 12, compiled from the reports of the Census Bureau for 1910, 
shows the total number of children of each age and the number of these 
who attend school. This is shown for the total population, the native 
white population, the foreign-born white population, and the Negro 
population. The same facts are presented graphically in figure 13. 
A relatively small percentage of Negro children attends school. At 
the age of 11, when the largest percentage attends, only 72.7 per cent 
are enrolled in school. Of the total population, only 52.1 per cent 
enters school at the age of 6. This increases to 75 per cent for those 7 
years of age and to 91.2 per cent for those 11 years of age, at which age 
the greatest percentage attends school. After children pass the age of 
14 the rate of decrease in the percentage attending school becomes 
very pronounced. This is the age when most compulsory attendance 
laws cease to operate effectively, and the result is clearly in evidencein 
this figure. Only 22.6 per cent of the children 18 years of ageare to be 
found in school. Among our foreign-born white population the 
school mortality is very rapid after the age of 13, indicating that fewer 
such children enroll in the upper grades and high school. At the age 
of 18 only 6.8 per cent of the foreign-born white children are to be 
found in school.

PUPILS HAVING A SHORT SCHOOL TERM. 
Only 8 States reported a distribution of enrollment according to 
the length of the school term provided. The results have been sum- 
marized in Table 13 and shown graphically in figure 14. This study 
is based on the length of school term provided for 2,364,655. pupils in 
elementary and high schools. Only a very few children have a term 
shorter than 20 days, or longer than 200 days. Over 9,000 children 
have a two months’ school term, over 26,000 a three months’ term, 
almost 42,000 a four months’ term, 25,000 a five months’ term, etc., 
as shown in the table. In other words, 4 per cent of the children have 
a two months’ school; 1.1 per cent, three months; 1.8 per cent, four 
months; 1.1 per cent, five months, etc.

term beyond a given number of days. Thus, 18.4 per cent of the 
2,364,655 pupils do not have a school term exceeding 140 days and 
40.5 per cent not exceeding 160 days. The general direction taken 
by this curve resembles an ogive in architecture. It is doubtful if

In Table 15 the average daily attendance in these eight States is 
distributed according to the length of school term’ provided. At the 
bottom of this table the average daily attendance and the corre- 
sponding enrollment are given, from which the percentage of attend- 
ance has been computed. These percentages are shown graphically 
in figure 15. In this figure it appears that the attendance is poorest 
in schools having a six, seven, or eight months’ term. The per cent

of attendance is highest where the term is very short or very long. 
In other words, in schools running for nine months 76 children out 
of each 100 enrolled will attend each day. In ten-months’ schools | 
80 children will attend regularly. This condition seems to indicate 
that the more nearly the school term becomes an all-year affair the 
more nearly do children consider it their business to attend regularly. 
In case the term is very short, less than 100 days, the children con- 
sider it a special privilege to be permitted to attend for so short a 
‘time. The two extremes in the graph represent only a limited num- 
ber of pupils and are not to be generalized upon.

TEACHERS. 
As will be observed from Table 38, the total number of teachers in 
the United States in 1918 was 650,709. This number includes 105,194 
men and 545,515 women. In other words, only 16.1 per cent of the 
teachers in 1918 were men. These totals include 15 men and 3,522 
women who were employed as kindergarten teachers, 75,448 men and 
486,736 women who were teaching in the elementary schools, and 
29,731 men and 55,259 women who gave instruction in high schools 
and vocational schools. As near as can be ascertained, these 650,709 
teachers filled 633,585 teaching positions. It will be observed that 
a negligible percentage of men teachers is employed in kindergartens. 
In the elementary schools only 13.4 per cent of the 562,184 teachers 
were men. In the secondary schools 35 per cent of the 84,988 ° 
teachers were men. 
There has been a general decrease in the percentage of men teach- 
ers since 1880. At that time 42.8 per cent of all teachers were men. 
This percentage has decreased to 34.5 per cent in 1890, to 29.9 per 
cent in 1900, to 21.1 per cent in 1910, to 19.8 per cent in 1916, and to 
16.1 per cent in 1918. It can be seen, therefore, that the present 
scarcity of men teachers has not been caused wholly by war con- 
ditions. This tendency has been in evidence for some time but may 
have been accelerated slightly in 1918 by the war. This decreasing 
percentage is clearly illustrated in figure 16, in which three concentric 
circles are shown representing these average percentages for 1890, 
1910, and 1918. At the present rate of decrease, few men teachers 
will be left in the profession in the next 20 years. This graph shows 
the percentage of men teachers in each State for these three dates. 
The States are arranged around the circle in the decreasing order 
of the percentage of men teachers in 1918. Itis found that Arkansas, 
Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Utah, and Tennessee still have 
more than 25 per cent of their teachers men. New Mexico, Alabama, 
North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, and 
Arizona have lost most all of their men teachers within the last 
quarter of a century. In Vermont, Nebraska, Connecticut, New 
Hampshire, Wyoming, Colorado, Maine, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Iowa, Delaware, Minnesota, and Wisconsin the per cent of men 
teachers is now less than 10. In fact, in these States the proportion 
of men teachers has never been very great. It is also evident from 
the figure that the distinctly “rural” States have always had rela- 
tively high percentages of men teachers. In such industrial States 
as Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Jersey the men have not 
gone into the teaching profession. In short, men have chosen the 
most remunerative occupation open to them and have only resorted 
to teaching when other occupatiorls were less remunerative. The
-P-A-G-E-90
90 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
logical conclusion is that teachers’ salaries must be substantially 
increased in order to induce young men to take up the profession o 
teaching or to retain in the profession the men who have already 
enlisted.

TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
The average annual salary of all teachers has increased slowly, 
but steadily, since 1870, as shown in Table 1. In 1870 the average 
was $189; in 1880, $195; in 1885, $224; in 1890, $252; in 1895, $286; 
in 1900, $325; in 1905, $386; in 1910, $485; in 1915, $543; in 1916, 
$563, and in 1918, $635. It will be observed that the average 
increase for the past two years has been only $72—$36 per year— 
or about 6.4 per cent per year over the salaries paid in 1916. This 
rate of increase has not been commensurate with the increased cost 
of living as shown by the reports of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

-P-A-G-E-91
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 91 
The total increase in the cost of living for a five-year period (De- 
cember, 1914, to June, 1919) has been 76.76 per cent, or an average 
of 17.1 per cent per year over the cost in 1914. This percentage is 
computed from the increased cost of living in 18 shipbuilding cities, 
and probably is about correct for the country as a whole. 
When one examines figure 17, it is found that a great variation 
from the average exists in a number of States. At one énd of the 
array the averages are $1,052, $1,012, and $976—the salaries paid 
by the District of Columbia, California, and New York, respectively. 
At the other end one finds South Carolina, Mississippi, and North 
Carolina, with averages of $315, $291, and $284, respectively. These 
low averages in all the States must be increased, if the schools are 
to retain their most capable teachers. Few promising college or 
normal school graduates will care to enter a profession which pays 
so poorly. 
Only 16 States and the District of Columbia made a reliable 
separation of the expenditures for the salaries of elementary and 
high-school teachers. In figure 18 it is found that the average 
salary of 26,721 high-school teachers in these States is $1,031. Since 
so many States are represented, the average is presumably about 
correct for the country as a whole. All sections of the United States 
are represented in the figure, and the study includes the salaries of 
over 31 per cent of all high-school teachers in the United States. 
California pays the highest average of any State represented, viz, 
$1,355; and Maine, the lowest, viz, $652. As most secondary 
teachers are college graduates, the averages paid are exceedingly low. 
The average salaries of elementary teachers in the same States is 
$606. California ranks first in this classification, paying an average 
salary of $891, which is even higher than that paid in the District of 
Columbia. Of the States represented, Georgia pays the lowest 
salaries—the average being only $314. About 25 per cent of the 
elementary teachers in the United States are represented in this 
or ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPERVISORY OFFICERS. 
The 650,709 teachers hereinbefore mentioned do not include admin- 
istrative and supervisory officers who devote half or more than half 
of their time to supervision. In 1918 26,890 administrative and 
supervisory officers were reported. Most of these officers are men and 
should be taken into consideration in discussing the decreasing short- 
age of men teachers. The percentages given above, however, are 
comparable, since administrative and supervisory officers have never 
been reported as teachers, and have not been included in the reports 
preceding 1918. Of the 26,890 officers designated above, 9,180 are 
employed in administrative positions. This number includes 377 em- 
ployees (not clerks and stenographers) in State offices of education,

TOTAL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
The data reported on the number of schools is not entirely reliable, 
since this information has never been sought in the statistical question- 
naires used in preceding years. In certain States aschoolis defined as 
a schoolroom over which a teacher has charge. For the purposes of 
this report a school is defined as a unit of organization under the 
supervision of a principal, in case such officer is employed, or a one- 
room rural school in charge of one teacher. A high school, an ele- 
‘mentary school, and a kindergarten, although housed in the same 
building, should be counted as three separate schools. Since many 
of the States had not modified their questionnaires in 1918 in accord-
-P-A-G-E-94
94 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ance with this standard, the returns often lack uniformity. Where 
no report was made, it was assumed that the number of schools was 
equal to the number of school buildings. The aggregate number of 
schools secured in this manner is 277,734. This aggregate is un- 
doubtedly too low, but no data are available on which to base a closer 
estimate.

CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS. 
For the purpose of this report a consolidated school is defined as 
one which employs two or more teachers and which has been formed 
by the union of two or more rural schools. In no case should “the 
number of consolidated schools’’ refer to the number of rural schools 
abandoned through consolidation. The returns on the number of 
consolidated schools are not entirely satisfactory, since several States 
did not have the information at hand and could make no report. 
Altogether, 33 States reported an aggregate of 8,404 consolidated 
schools. Only 22 States reported the number of consolidated schools 
established this year. The aggregate reported was 511. In all 
probability the total number of such schools now in the United States 
is not far from 12,000.
-P-A-G-E-95
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 95 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
In 1918 the various State officers reported an aggregate of 276,827 
buildings used for school purposes. In 1916 the number of buildings 
reported was 281,524. This decrease of 4,697 buildings is largely 
accounted for by the fact that in certain States many of the one-room 
rural schools have been abandoned through consolidation. In 1916 
the State officers were asked to report the “total number of school 
buildings owned and rented.” In 1918 they were asked to give the 
“number of buildings used for school purposes.”’ It is doubtful if 
this modification in the question produced any material decrease in 
the number of buildings reported, since the new blanks were not sub- 
mitted to the State officers until after they had received the reports for 
1918 from the local school officials. Only a few States reported the 
number of buildings used exclusively for high-school purposes. 
The total number of buildings reported above includes both rural 
school buildings and school buildings in cities. From the special 
reports from city school officers it is found that there are 18,974 
school buildings in the total number of cities which had a population 
of 5,000 or over in 1910 and in 661-smaller cities which had a popula- 
tion between 2,500 and 5,000 in 1910. If the number of buildings in 
cities is taken from the total number of buildings in the United States, 
the remainder gives the number of rural school buildings. This num- 
ber is found to be 257,853. From the reports of the State officers it is 
found that there were 195,400 one-room rural school buildings in the 
United States in 1918. In other words, 76 per cent of the rural school 
buildings have only one room. Herein lies the crude material with 
which the movement for the consolidation of schools must work. 
The percentage of rural school buildings having only one room has 
been computed for each State, as shown graphically in figure 20. 
Utah has the smallest percentage, only 23 per cent; Rhode Island 
comes second with 37 per cent; and Texas, third with 42 per cent. 
Tn all other States half or more fhan half of the rural schools have only 
one room. In Iowa, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Montana, South 
Dakota, and Minnesota 90 per cent or more of the rural schools have 
only one room. 
VALUE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
The total value of all public property used for school purposes was 
$1,983,508,818 in 1918. This includes the value of buildings, sites, 
and all equipment. Not all States were able to show just how much 
of this total was the value of sites and buildings or of equipment; nor 
were many of them able to separate the value of property used for 
elementary and for secondary schools. The distribution made has 
been given in Table 41.-

    98 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Considerable variation exists as to the value of school property in 
each State for each child enrolled in school. The average value for 
the United States is over $95, as shown in figure 21. The District of 
Columbia has $212 invested in school property for each child enrolled. 
Nevada ranks second, with a per capita of almost $167; and New 
York third with an average of $157. At the other extreme, Missis- 
sippi has less than $9 invested in school property for each child in 
school; North Carolina has less than $23; Georgia, less than $23; and 
South Carolina almost $25. In other words, Nevada has almost 19 
times as great a per capita value of school property as Mississippi; 
New York 7 times as much as North Carolina; and Massachusetts, 
over 6 times as much as Georgia. 
The supplementary corner graph groups in a concrete way the 
details shown in the larger figure. Thus, almost 6 millions of children 
live in States where the per capita value of school property is be- 
tween $125 and $150. Over 2 millions live in the four States having 
a per capita value less than $25. Almost one-third of the children 
in the United States live in States having a per capita value less than 
a THE CHILD’S BANK ACCOUNT. 
Table 42 shows the principal of the permanent school funds in 
each State and also the acreage and value of unsold school lands. 
The total amount of the permanent school funds in the various 
States is $358,126,268. This amount would be sufficient to run the 
schools of the United States for almost half the school year, or 80 
days. In other words, the child’s available cash amounts to $17.17 
and would keep him in school for about four months. Most of this 
money is controlled by the State, viz, $308,118,870, while a relatively 
small portion is managed by local officials, viz, $50,007,398. 
According to the reports received, the total acreage of unsold 
school lands in the United States is 46,314,957. This is an average 
of a little more than 2 acres for each child enrolled in school. The 
estimated value of these unsold school lands is $484,200,293, or an 
average value of $10.45 per acre. The average value of school . 
lands for each child enrolled in school is $23.22. The child’s bank 
account amounts, therefore, to $40.39, consisting of $17.17 bearing 
interest and $23.22 invested in lands, some of which are leased. 
This total wealth, if rendered available, would maintain the schools 
of the United States for a little longer than one year. 
The generalization made above regarding the bank account of the 
average child is more or less fictitious, as shown in figure 22. The 
available cash for each child in each State is represented by the 
black bar, while the per capita investment in school lands is repre- 
sented by the “concreted’’ part of the bar extending beyond it. 
The total length of the two portions of bar represents the value of

school funds and school lands for each child enrolled in school. It 
represents, therefore, the child’s potential wealth, while the black 
part denotes his ‘ready’ cash. A great variation exists among the 
different States with regard to this per capita value. Montana has 
a per capita value of $888 per pupil; South Dakota, $737; and 
Arizona, $680. At, the other extreme, it is found that the same 
average for Georgia and Pennsylvania is practically nothing. By 
noting the corner graph, it will be found that almost 12 millions of 
children heve less than $10 each in their bank accounts. Nevada 
has the greatest per capita value of “ready’’ cash. In other words, 
for each child enrolled in the public schools of Nevada there is $181 
in the permanent school fund. On this score South Dakota has $123 
per pupil; and North Dakota, $114. 
INTEREST ON THE CHILD’S BANK ACCOUNT. 
It is of greater interest to ascertain the income from permanent 
school funds and school lands per pupil than. to compute the per 
capita value thereof, since much school land is not leased, and some 
permanent school funds are loaned at a very low rate of interest. 
The income, therefore, from these sources has been divided by the 
number of children attending school, and the results are shown in 
figure 23. The annual income for each pupil in Wyoming is $12.68. 
Nevada comes next with an average income of $11.24, and Montana, 
third with a per capita of $9.80. New Hampshire and Pennsylvania 
report no income from this source. In North Carolina the interest 
is added to the existing fund and does not benefit the present gener- 
ation of school children. Each pupil in Georgia receives 2 cents; 
in Maryland, 6 cents; and in Arkansas, 12 cents. The average for 
the United States is only $1.03. The average annual cost of main- 
taining the public schools per pupil enrolled is $30.91, as is shown 
further on in this chapter. The income from permanent funds and 
school lands is sufficient, therefore, to keep a pupil in school for 
one-thirtieth of the school year or a little more than five days. It 
is evident from this deduction that the schools must secure the greater 
portion of their revenue from taxation and other sources. The 
corner graph in figure 23 shows that 15 millions of children each re- 
ceive less than $1 per annum from the interest on their bank 
account. 
THE SCHOOL DEBT. 
For a number of years the States have been asked to report the 
total school indebtedness, in the form of outstanding school bonds 
or of temporary loans, but the returns have been so incomplete that 
they have not been published. In 1918 all the States, except 13, 
reported their existing indebtedness, viz, Alabama, Arizona, District

of Columbia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Montana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South 
Carolina. The total debt reported for the remaining 36 States is 
$469,089,795. The total number of children enrolled in school in 
these 36 States is 15,447,086. The school debt, therefore, averages 
$30.37 per pupil. This average is only $10.02 less than the average 
pupil’s bank account ($40.39). In other words, each pupil is in 
debt to the extent of three-fourths of his bank account or capital. 
Assuming that the 5,406,430 children enrolled in school in the 13 
States named above and not making a report on existing school 
indebtedness have an overhanging indebtedness of $30.37 each, the 
total school indebtedness in these 13 States would be $164,193,279. 
If this estimate is correct, and if the other 36 States reported their 
total school indebtedness, the total school indebtedness of the 
United States is $633,283,074. This amount is about 83 per cent 
of the amount of money necessary to run all the schools of the United 
States for one year. In other words, if we should stop our schools 
for a year we could pay off our school debt, and have a small balance. 
PAYMENT OF THE SCHOOL DEBT. 
Only 12 States did not report the amuunt paid in 1918 on the 
school debt, viz, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, 
and Pennsylvania. The total amount paid on the school debt by 
the other 87 States was $14,782,914. This sum includes the amount 
paid from current funds, i. e., from moneys raised by taxation or 
appropriation in 1918 and also any amounts paid out of sinking 
funds which had been accumulating in previous years. The total 
number of pupils enrolled in school in these 37 States was 14,093,753, 
und the total indebtedness liquidated was $14,782,914. In other 
words, the per capita indebtedness canceled during the year was $1.05. 
If a corresponding per capita amount was paid in the other 12 States 
for the 6,759,763 pupils enrolled in school in these States, it is esti- 
mated that an additional amount of $7,097,751 was paid on the 
school debt in 1918. The total amortization of indebtedness in 1918 
is, therefore, estimated to be $21,880,665. Proceeding at this rate 
it would take almost 29 years to pay off the estimated total school 
debt of $633,283,074. This is not surprising in view of the fact that 
most school bonds run for long periods, varying from 10 to 35 years, 
and that the greater portion of the school debt is not due to temporary 
loans, but to either serial or long-term bonds. Another factor must 
also be reckoned with in that a larger proportion of bonds may become 
due in one year than in another, consequently the deduction drawn 
above may be only approximate.
-P-A-G-E-103
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 103 
SINKING FUNDS. 
Only 11 States reported the amount in their school sinking funds. 
The total amount thus reported was $11,531,576. From these 
meager reports it is not safe to estimate the total ammount in the 
sinking fund in all the States. As many school laws now authorize 
only the issuance of serial bonds, which are paid off annually as they 
become due, it is not safe to assume that the States not reporting the 
amount in the sinking funds have the same per capita amount in 
such funds as the States do which issue long-term bonds and provide 
for accumulating sinking funds. 
Nine States reported an aggregate of $4,985,931 transferred to 
sinking funds during the school year 1917-18. 
INTERESt PAID ON INDEBTEDNESS, 
Altogether, 20 States did not report the amount of interest paid 
on indebtedness. In the other 29 States the interest amounted to 
$15,154,585, or an equivalent of $1.25 for each of the 12,113,570 
pupils enrolled in the schools of these States. In other words, the 
interest per pupil ($1.25) paid out annually is 20 cents more than the 
per capita amount paid out for the liquidation of debts ($1.05). 
The interest on the school debt is 19 per cent greater than the pay- 
ments made on the debt itself. Assuming that the 20 States not 
reporting this item pay the same amount of interest per pupil enrolled, 
the additional amount for interest would be $10,924,933. The total 
amount of interest paid on the school debt in 1918 would be $26,- 
079,518. This amount represents the interest paid on the total 
estimiated school debt of $633,283,074. If these estimates are essen- 
tially correct, the average rate of interest paid is 4.12 per cent. 
It is shown above that the average income. from schoo] funds and 
school lands for each pupil enrolled is $1.03. More than this amount, 
$1.05, is paid out each year to meet maturing bonds and other forms 
of debt. An additional $1.25 per pupil is spent for interest. It can 
be seen, therefore, that the pupil's financial obligations in effect are 
more than double his assets. 
REVENUE RECEIPTS. 
Tt is shown in figure 24 that the percentage of school revenue 
derived from the State taxes has decreased and that the proportion 
derived from local taxes has increased since 1890. The proportion 
coming from permanent school funds and school lands and also the 
proportion derived from all other sources have decreased within this 
period of 28 years. The schools are coming more and more to depend 
upon local taxation for support. Unfortunately, it is impossible to 
ascertain what proportion accrued from county taxation in the years
-P-A-G-E-104
104 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
preceding 1918, as the meager data reported did not warrant 
publication. 
In figure 25 the total revenue receipts have been classified into 
three groups, showing the proportion received from the State, the 
county, and the local unit of taxation. This figure and the two 
immediately following do not include moneys derived from the sale 
of bonds, from the negotiation of temporary loans, the proceeds 
from the sale of school property, nor any moneys derived from 
insurance adjustments. In this figure ‘‘State” includes all moneys 
derived from State taxation or appropriation, all income from State |

unit of taxation. In other words, over three-fourths of all school 
moneys come from local support. Considerable variation exists

106 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
among the States in regard to this matter. Alabama receives over 
60 per cent of its school revenue from State sources. Seven other 
States receive as much as 40 per cent from this source, and 15 other 
States derive over 20 per cent therefrom. In three States over 60 
per cent of the school revenue comes from the county. In three 
other States over 40 per cent of such revenue is so derived. Alto- 
gether, 17 States get over one-fifth of their school revenue from the 
county. In 11 States over 90 per cent of the school revenue comes 
from the local unit. In 4 other States over 80 per cent is so derived. 
Altogether, 26 States get over 60 per cent of their school moneys 
from the local unit of taxation. 
In figure 26 the total revenue receipts have been classified so as to 
show the proportion coming from school funds and school lands, from 
taxation and appropriation, and from all other sources. It is 
strikingly apparent that the greater portion of the school revenue is 
derived from annual taxation. and appropriation. In fact, only 2.9 
per cent comes from permanent school funds and school lands, and 
only 4.6 per cent from incidental sources. In short, 92.5 per cent of 
our school revenue is raised annually by taxation. In only 17 States 
is the proportion raised by taxation less than 90 per cent. In 9 
States oyer one-tenth of the school revenue comes from school funds 
and school lands. In 2 States this proportion is over one-fifth. In 6 
States the amount coming from incidental sources is equal to at least 
one-tenth of the total revenue, and in Texas over one-fifth of the 
school money comes from incidental sources. 
In figure 27! the amount of school money received only from taxa- 
tion and appropriation has been ‘‘broken up” to show the proportion 
coming from the State, the county, and the local unit (township, 
district, or municipality). In Alabama over 60 per cent of the 
amount raised by taxation comes from a State tax. In 7 other 
States this percentage exceeds 40. In 11 other States over one-fifth 
of the amount raised by. taxation comes from a State school tax or 
appropriation. In New Mexico the county is the sole unit of taxa- 
tion for school purposes. In two other States over 60 per cent comes 
from the county, in three other States the proportion exceeds 40 
per cent, and in 10 additional States the proportion is greater than 
20 oak cent. Three States, Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico, 
    
igure 27, like all other data in this ue is based upon statistical returns from the several State 
superintendents of public instruction. It is substantially correct, but in some particulars it is not ab- 
solutelyso. Forexample, in certain States, as in Oregon, in which there is no general State tax or appro- 
priation for schools, the expenses of the State department of education are paid from the general funds of 
the State. ‘This constitutes a State appropriation to education to this extent, but the diagram does not 
show it. In other cases, it was not practicable to obtain complete figures; in New Mexico, for example, 
the “county unit” extends only to rural districts, but the amounts raised by the cities and towns were 
notstated by the State superintendent; and he was unable to segregate the amount raised by State taxation 
from the income on the permanent fund. Such departures from strict accuracy are, however, relatively 
unimportant.

-P-A-G-E-109
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 109 
had no local school tax in 1918. In South Dakota all the school tax 
is local. In 16 other States over 80 per cent of the school tax comes 
from local sources. For the United States as a whole, 14.8 per cent 
of the school revenue derived from taxation and appropriation comes 
from the State, 8 per cent from the county, and 77.2 per cent from 
the local unit. It is seen, therefore, that over three-fourths of such 
revenue comes from local sources. 
NONREVENUE RECEIPTS. 
Nonrevenue receipts include all moneys derived from the sale of 
bonds, from the negotiation of temporary loans, from the sale of 
school property, or from the proceeds of insurance adjustments. In 
short, any moneys derived by decreasing the value of school property 
or by putting the school district under future obligations are considered 
as nonrevenue receipts. The total amount of nonrevenue receipts 
reported in 1918 was $65,736,726. This aggregate includes $59,- 
601,978 derived from loans and bond sales; $1,348,183 from the sale 
of property and the proceeds of insurance adjustments, and $4,- 
786,565 from other sources. The amount derived from borrowed 
money includes the proceeds of county loans aggregating $5,029,993. 
In other words, 8.4 per cent of the bond sales authorized were county 
obligations. As only 33 States reported the amount received from 
loans and bond sales, the per capita debt incurred for each of the 
13,513,401 pupils in these States is $4.41. Assuming that an equal 
per capita indebtedness was incurred for the 7,340,115 children in 
the other 16 States, the total additional indebtedness would be 
$32,369,907, making a grand total of $91,971,885. This amount 
indicates the extent to which the schools are going into debt annually. 
If these foregoing estimates are correct, viz, $1.05 paid on indebted- 
ness per pupil, and $4.41 the per pupil additional indebtedness in- 
volved annually, the schools are now incurring over four times as 
much debt annually as they are liquidating. It should be remarked, 
however, that temporary loans are often incurred which are met the 
following fiscal year, and, consequently, should not be properly charge- 
able fo permanent indebtedness authorized for the construction of 
buildings, purchasing sites, or for meeting any unusual cepital ex- 
penditure. On this score the per capita debt of $4.41 may be slightly 
exaggerated. Temporary loans negotiated and repaid during the 
same fiscal year have not been included in this report. 
BALANCE ON HAND. 
The total balance on hand from the preceding school year (1916-17) 
as reported by 44 States was $172,323,850. This is about one-fourth 
the amount necessary to maintain the schools for the year considered 
in this report, 1918.

EXPENDITURES. 
The total expenditure for the schools in 1918 was $763,678,089, 
excluding the payment of bonds. The amount spent for the same 
purpose in 1916 was $640,717,053. This increase of $112,961,036 
is equal to 17.6 per cent for the two-year period, or an annual increase 
of 8.8 per cent over the cost in 1916. Some conception of this 
enormous expenditure may be gained when it is noted that it costs 
$4,745,974, or almost $5,000,000 per day, to run the schools of the‘ 
United States.

  Fic. 28.—Proportion of total school expenditures going for teachers’ salaries, new buildings, sites, and | 
new equipment, 1870-1918. 
An attempt is made in the following pages to analyze school ex- 
penditures so as to show what proportion of the cost of education is 
incurred for the various functions and to show the per capita cost 
of the same on several bases for the different States. In figure 28 
it is found that there has been a general decrease in the proportion 
of expenditures going for teachers’ salaries since 1880. At that 
time over 70 per cent of the schools’ costs went for this purpose. In 
1918 only a little over 57 per cent went for the salaries of teachers 
and superintendents. Beginning in 1890, it is found that an increas-
-P-A-G-E-111
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 111 
ing proportion of expenditures is being made for miscellaneous pur- 
poses. In general there has been little change in the proportion 
spent for new buildings, sites, and new equipment. The decrease in 
the proportion spent for teachers’ salaries has been due, therefore, to 
the increased proportion going for capital outlays. 
The expenditures for 1918 have been minutely analyzed into the 
various functions of expense in figure 29. The left half of the figure 
shows the proportion going for general control, for instruction, for 
miscellaneous purposes, and for capital outlays. Of each school 
dollar spent, 3.3 cents goes for general control; 58.2 cents for instruc- 
tion; 23 cents for miscellaneous purposes; and 15.5 cents for new 
buildings, sites, and new equipment. The right half of the graph 
shows the subdivisions of these major functions of expense. Thus 1 
cent goes for school boards and business officers; 2 cents for salaries of 
superintendents; 55 cents for salaries of supervisors, principals, and 
teachers; 6.9 cents for janitors’ salaries; 7.8 cents for fuel, water, 
light, and power, etc. From this figure it is possible for any State to 
compare the distribution of its school expenditures with the average 
for all the States. | 
The distribution of school expenditures for each State is shown in 
figure 30. The arrows indicate the average per cent going for 
instruction, for miscellaneous expenses, for outlays, and for general 
control. The States are arranged around the circle in the decreasing 
order of the magnitude of the proportion of school moneys going for 
instruction. It is found that Mississippi ranks first, spending over 90 
per cent of its schoo] money for instruction. Georgia comes second; 
South Carolina, third; and North Carolina, fourth. New Mexico, 
Michigan, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania, on this score, spend the 
smallest proportions for instruction. It is possible in this graph that 
the central tendency indicates the more commendable practice of 
disbursing school moneys. The middle half of the States is indicated 
by the arrows in the center of the figure. It should be remembered 
that all school expenditures, excluding the payment of bonds, are 
included in this figure. From it any State can judge whether it is 
above or below the average for the total school cost. Usually for a 
State as a whole under normal conditions the proportion of money 
spent for new buildings and grounds will not vary considerably from 
year to year. In other words, the building program of a State for a 
period of years is fairly constant. 
As the “ building” factor in 1918 was subject to unusual and varied 
restriction on account of the war, it is desirable to show separately the 
distribution of the current expenditures in each State, including only 
the proportion going for instruction, for general control, and for mis- 
cellaneous purposes. In figure 31 the States are again arranged

THE PER CAPITA COST OF EDUCATION. 
Figure 32 shows how the per capita cost of education has increased in 
the United States for five-year periods beginning in 1870. The data 
on which the curves depend are found in Tablo1. In 1870 the annual 
cost of education for each person in the population was less than $2. 
The average has steadily increased since that time until in 1918 the

major functions of expense, 1917-18, 
average cost is a little over $7. The rate of increase has been com- 
paratively rapid since 1900. 
Probably a better conception of school costs may be secured by 
noting the other two curves in this figure. The upper one represents 
the annual cost for each pupil in average daily attendance; the lower 
one, the daily cost for each pupil attending. The annual cost has 
increased from $15 per pupil in attendance in 1885 to over $49 in

918. Since 1900 the increase has been very pronounced. In fact 
e annual cost has more than doubled in these 18 years. As 
hown by the “dotted” curve, there was little increase in the average 
aily cost from 1870 to 1900. Since the latter date the cost has 
increased from 14 cents to almost 31 cents per day or has more than 
oubled. 
In figure 33 the average annual cost in 1918 for each person in the 
opulation is shown by States. In 6 Southern States the per capita 
ost is less than $3. In these 6 States over 13 millions of people live.

cost is over $12 for each person in the population. The average cost 
for the United States is $7.26. 
It was not thought advisable to secure the average annual cost for 
each child 5 to 18 years of age, since in 4 States and the District of 
Columbia the number enrolled in school exceeds the number of 
children of this school age. Since no Federal census has been taken 
for 8 years, the census estimates are not dependable for States in 
which there has been considerable shifting in the population. Con- 
sequently,. the school enrollment serves as a better basis on which to 
compare the cost of education in one State with that in another. 
In figure 34 the States have been ranked on the cost for current 
expenses for each pupil enrolled. The additional per capita cost for

  new buildings, sites, and new equipment is added to the end of each 
bar but does not affect the ranking. The great variation in the 
lengths of these ‘‘concreted”’ additions shows the building program 
in each State reduced to a uniform basis. The magnitude of these 
projections is subject to variation from year to year, depending on 
the “‘building” program, while the main body of the bar will change 
but slightly from one report to another. It is not derogatory to any 
State to have incurred a small per capita expenditure for new build- 
ings, since the preceding year may have witnessed unusual expendi- 
tures for this purpose and since war conditions may have prevented 
many building projects contemplated. In figure 34 it is shown that 
Montana and Nevada each spend ever $50 per year for each pupil 
enrolled. Almost 7 millions of children are enrolled in school in the 
16 States, incurring a cost varying from $40 to $50 per pupil. In 3 
States, Alabama, North Carolina, and Mississippi, the corresponding 
average cost is less than $10. In 10 States the average cost varies 
from $10 to $20 per pupil. The average cost for all pupils in the 
United States is $30.91. In the highest State the average cost is 
more than seven times as much as it is in the lowest State. 
Since the per cent of school attendance varies considerably in the 
different States, the preceding figure may not properly represent ’ 
what is being spent for education. Figure 35 shows just how much 
is spent annually for each pupil in average daily attendance. The 
bars represent this annual cost for meeting current expenses, while 
the ‘‘concreted” ends again represent the annual cost of outlays. 
In 3 States, Montana, Arizona, and Nevada, the average cost is 
over $70 per pupil attending, while at the other extreme the average 
is less than $15 in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Mississippi. The 
average cost for each pupil in average daily attendance in the United 
States is $41.45. The corner graph shows that the average amount 
spent on 24 millions of pupils varies from $10 to $20 per year. For 
14 millions of pupils in average attendance the annual cost is over $60. 
For the largest single group of pupils the average varies from $40 to 
$50. 
As the average length of the school term varies from 113 days in 
South Carolina to 193 days in Rhode Island, it is evident that the 
annual cost for each pupil attending daily does not enable one to gain 
a true conception of school costs. In other words, the school costs 
have not been reduced to a common unit of measurement. For 
example, in South Carolina the annual cost per pupil in average daily 
attendance is $17.48, while in Rhode Island it is $47.83. From these 
two averages alone it would appear that Rhode Island spends 2.7 
times as much as South Carolina. This is true for the total amount 
spent annually for each child attending daily, but it does not mean 
that the quality of instruction, as measured in dollars and cents, is

2.7 times as good in one State as in the other. In Rhode Island 
$47.83 is spent for 193 days’ schooling, while in South Carolina $17.48 
is spent for 113 days’ schooling. The daily cost in Rhode Island is 
25 cents, while in South Carolina it is 15 cents. As measured in 
monetary values, the teaching in Rhode Island is only 1.7 times as 
valuable as it is in South Carolina for the 113 days. True, the schools 
in Rhode Island are continued for 80 days longer at the same daily 
cost. In figure 36 this average daily cost is shown for each State. 
In 5 States the daily cost exceeds 40 cents per pupil. In 11 States 
this cost is less than 20 cents per pupil. Almost 6 millions of pupils 
attending daily live in States which pay from 20 to 30 cents per day 
for their education. The average for the United States is 26 cents 
per day per pupil. An additional 5 cents per day per pupil is spent 
for new buildings, grounds, and new equipment. 
SCHOOL EXPENDITURES AND WEALTH. 
Any standard by which expenditures have been judged above does 
not give a correct notion as to the extent to which a State pays 
according to its taxable wealth or its ability to pay. In other words, 
we have not yet ascertained how much each State pays for the support 
of its schools for each $100 of the estimated true value of all property 
taxable for scliool purposes. Unfortunately, it becomes necessary 
to use statistics for 1912 in making this comparison, since the esti- 
mated true value of taxable property was last ascertained in 1912 
by the Bureau of the Census. Consequently, the expenditures for 
school purposes for 1912 must also be used. From figure 37 it is 
found that Idaho and Utah contribute the most heavily toward the 
maintenance of their schools, the former paying 50.1 cents and the 
latter 49.4 cents for each $100 of true taxable wealth. The corre- 
sponding average for the United States is 27.6 cents. In 5 States, 
Towa, South Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Nevada, less than 
20 cents is paid per $100. By noting the corner graph in this figure, 
it is found that the great majority of the pupils enrolled in school 
live in States which contribute from 20 to 35 cents for each $100 of 
true wealth. Two millions of pupils now attend school in States 
where the taxpayers contribute less than one-fifth of 1 per cent of 
their wealth annually for tho maintenance of the public schools. 
About a million and a half of pupils reside in States where the tax 
burden is unusually heavy, i. e., over 35 cents on the $100. 
THE WEALTH BEHIND EACH PUPIL. 
Resorting again to the statistics of 1912, it is found that the 
average true value of taxable wealth behind each pupil enrolled in 
school at that time was $9,610, as shown in figure 38. This is the true

  alue of property on which a school tax can be levied for keeping 
he average pupil in school for the average school term. Considerable 
ariation from this average is found among the different States. In 
ississippi the corresponding average is only $2,561, while in Nevada 
it amounts to $39,771, or more than 15 timesasmuch. In other words, 
evada is 15 times as able to keep its pupils in school as is Mississippi. 
‘he wealth per pupil in Nevada is more than twice as great as it is in 
alifornia, the State ranking second in this chart. In 8 States the 
ealth behind each pupil is less than $5,000. If the pupils are 
rouped as shown in the corner graph, it is found that about one- 
ourth of the pupils live in States where the average wealth behind 
hem is between $10,000 and $12,000. Since these amounts repre- 
ent the central tendency for the country as a whole, they might be 
aken as a standard from which to reckon ability to provide reason- 
ble school facilities. As good school conditions ought not to be 
xpected in States where the per pupil wealth is less than $10,000 
s in States having a greater per capita wealth. A shorter school 
erm, lower salaries, etc., will characterize the schools in these States 
nless an unusual tax levy is provided. On the other hand, a long 
chool term, high salaries, etc., will prevail in States having a per 
upil wealth exceeding $12,000, unless low tax rates predominate. 
n short, this figure shows the ability of each State to provide for the 
support of its schools. 
STATISTICS OF COLORED SCHOOLS. 
The school census and school enrollment.—From table 16 it is found 
hat there are in the South 8,150,448 white and 2,977,536 colored 
hildren from 5 to 18 years of age. It is seen, therefore, that almost 
7 per cent of the children of school age are colored. Of these, 
277,840 white children and 2,063,177 colored children are enrolled 
n the public schools. That is, 77 per cent of the white children and 
ver 69 per cent of the colored children of school age are enrolled in 
chool. It is apparent, therefore, that a greater proportion of white 
han of colored children take advantage of the public schools.

1 Estimated as to distribution. 2 Does not include Delaware, as in preceding reports, 
The ‘teaching load.” —F¥or these white pupils 174,980 teachers and 
for the colored pupils 36,920 teachers are employed. It is found 
that each white teacher instructs on an average about 36 pupils, 
while the colored teachers each instruct about 56 pupils. With such 
‘a heavy ‘teaching load,’ it is doubtful if as effective teaching can 
be done in the colored schools as in the white schools. This factor 
may partly account for the higher percentage of irregular attendance 
among colored pupils than among white pupils, as pointed out in a 
following paragraph. 
Colored pupils—The distribution of colored pupils by sex is 
shown in Table 61. Of the 1,765,177 colored pupils enrolled in school 
in these Southern States, 927,803 are girls and 837,374 are boys. In 
the secondary schools of these States there are 18,664 colored stu- 
dents, including 5,971 boys and 12,693 girls. It is seen that there 
are more than twice as many colored girls as boys in the high schools 
of the South. In the elementary schools there is a slightly larger 
proportion of colored girls than boys, viz, 831,403 boys and 915,110 
girls, or a total of 1,746,513 pupils. By comparing the elementary’ 
and the secondary pupils, it is seen that only a little over 1 per cent 
of the colored pupils in the South are to be found in the public high 
schools. ‘This is comparatively low when it is recalled that the high 
schools of the country enroll on an average of 9.3 per cent of all the 
children in the common schools. In other words, the proportion of 
colored children in high schools in the South is only about one-ninth 
the average proportion for the country. This average of only 1 col-  
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  ored pupil in 100 enrolled in high schools is also low when compared 
with the corresponding average for white pupils in the same States. 
The total number of white pupils enrolled in elementary and sec- 
ondary grades in all Southern States except Mississippi, which did 
not report enrollment in colored schools, is 6,025,084, while the cor- 
responding number enrolled in secondary schools alone is 449,199. 
From these totals it is found that in the white schools of the South 
7.5 per cent of the pupils are in high school. In short, over seven 
times as great a proportion of white pupils as colored pupils are to 
be found in secondary schools of the South. 
Length of school term.—F¥or 11 Southern States and the District of 
Columbia the length of the school term and the number of days 
attended have been computed as shown in Table 17 and figure 39. 
The data entering into these computations were not available for 
Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia. It is 
found that the average school term provided for the colored children 
is 111 days, while that provided for the white children is 148 days. 
In the elementary schools of six Southern States the average term 
provided for colored children is 106 days, while the corresponding 
term for white children is 145 days. In the secondary schools of 
four Southern States the average term for colored children is 153 
days, while the average term for white children is 165 days. It can 
be seen, therefore, that a greater difference exists between the jength

schools than in the secondary schools.

It is further found, as shown in the table and graph, that the aver- 
age time attended by each colored pupil enrolled is only 70 days, 
while the corresponding average for white children is 100 days. It 
is shown, therefore, that the colored child gets only seven-tenths as 
much schooling as the white children in the Southern States. Part 
of this, however, is the fault of the colored child, since he wastes on 
an average 37 per cent of the school term, while the white child 
loses only 32 per cent by irregular attendance. Stated in other 
terms, the colored pupils enrolled attend only 63 per cent of the school 
term, while the white children attend 68 -per cent of the time. 
The deductions made above are essentially correct for the whole 
South, since only 5 Southern States are not represented. Almost 
14 millions of colored children and 4} millions of white children 
attend school in these States. 
By comparing these averages with the averages for all the States, 
as shown at the bottom of figure 39, it is found that the average school 
term in the South for the colored children is only 69 per cent of the 
average term provided for the United States, viz, 160.7 days, while 
the average, term for white children in these States is 92 per cent of 
the average for the United States. It was shown above that the 
colored schools in the South waste 37 per cent of the school term and 
the white schools 32 per cent, while for the whole country the average 
waste due to irregular attendance is only 25.4 per cent. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAWS EFFECTIVE IN 1917-18. 
By means of a special supplementary inquiry to the State officers 
of education, the outstanding features of the compulsory attendance 
laws in operation in 1917-18 were ascertained. The results of this 
inquiry have been tabulated in Tables 18 and 19. In the following 
pages an attempt has been made to bring into light certain tenden- 
cies which might otherwise lie hidden in the tabulation. 
The school census.—It is generally admitted that a compulsory 
attendance law can not be effectively enforced if school officers do not 
know which children should be in school. If the law requires attend- 
ance from all children from 7 to 14 years of age, it is necessary to | 
ascertain the number of children of these ages residing within the 
State or local district. Unless the school census is taken, the enforce- 
ment of the attendance laws becomes wholly incidental and can not | 
operate uniformly upon all children of compulsory attendance age. 
In Table 18, it is found that only 3 States, California, Delaware, and 
South Carolina, do not provide legally for a school census. 
Local option laws.—Only 3 States, Florida, Mississippi, and South 
Carolina, in 1918, did not have State-wide compulsory attendance 
laws. In other words, these States had local option laws which
-P-A-G-E-129
STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 129 
became effective only when adopted by the various counties. As all 
counties under such provisions do not adopt such laws, all the children 
in these States are not obliged to attend school and do so only at 
their own volition 
The minimum school term.—The minimum school term provided in 
each State is shown graphically in figure 40. In 6 States no mini- 
mum school term is specified. Five of these are Southern States and 
the other a New England State. In the other States the minimum 
term varies from three months in 3 States to nine months in 6 States. 
These 6 States providing for nine months of school are Connecticut, 
the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and 
Rhode Island.

Fig. 40.—The minimum school term legally provided in each State, 1917-18. 
The minimum school term legally provided does not always 
| operate in bringing all schools up to this standard. If teachers can 
not be secured for all the schools, this condition would prevail. If 
the legal restrictions placed on the rate of taxation allowed are too 
stringent for the poorer school districts, the schools will not be main- 
tained for the minimum school term otherwise legally provided. 
The results of such conditions are in evidence in at least 11 States, 
as shown in figure 41. In the 5 States specifying a minimum term of 
4 months, one State has schools running for a shorter period than the 
minimum provided. Of the 9 States providing for a 6 months’ term, 
4 maintain some of their schools for a shorter period. Of the 10 
States legalizing a 7 months’ minimum term, 3 do not bring all schools 
up to this standard. Two States providing for 8 months of school

-P-A-G-E-130
  1380 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
and 1 State legalizing a 9 months’ minimum term maintain some of 
their schools for a shorter period. Briefly, 11 States do not live up 
to the minimum standard provided by law. It is clearly evident, 
therefore, that the minimum school term is not the best criterion by 
which to judge the minimum amount of schooling afforded for each 
child in each State. 
Minimum attendance required.—The efficiency of a compulsory 
attendance law in its last analysis is determined very largely by the 
minimum school attendance required of every child coming within 
the purview of the law. This feature of attendance laws is shown 
graphically in figure 42. It is found that Mississippi requires attend-

Fia. 41.—The legal and the actual minimum school term, 1917-18, 
ance for only 40 days during the school term. Alabama and Dela- 
ware compel attendance for only 60 days. Seven States provide for 
attendance of 80 days, and one State for 100 days. Altogether, 28 
States compel attendance for the full term of school provided. In 
5 States children are required to attend for some fractional part of the 
school term. In such cases the required attendance varies with the 
length of the school term provided by the local unit. 
The conditions cited above are subject to the following modifica- 
tion. While the minimum attendance required of every child does 
indicate the smallest amount of schooling with which the pupil can 
escape annually, it does not show what proportion of the school term 
he must attend. It does not show how much schooling the child is
-P-A-G-E-131
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 131 
allowed to miss. These modifications are exhibited in figure 43. 
For illustration, the full-term provision in 28 States has various mean- 
ings. In 6 of these States children must atjend for 9 months; in 4 
States, for 8 months; in 6 States, for 7 months; in 6 other States for 
6 months; in 2 States, for 5 months; in 2 other States, for 4 months; 
in 1 State, for only 8 months, and in the other State the minimum 
term is not specified. The longer bar in this figure has been ‘‘broken 
up” to show these various implications. Several apparent incon- 
sistencies are also in evidence. For example, two States require 
attendance for 80 days when no minimum term is Jegalized; another 
for 80 days when the minimum provided is only 60 days; another for 
60 days when no minimum is specified; and still enother for 140 days 
when no minimum has been provided.

  Fig, 42.—The minimum school attendance required of children of compulsory ettendance age, 1917-18 
Only 3 of the 25 States which enacted their first legislation on 
compulsory attendance over 30 years ago do not now require attend- 
ance for the full term of school provided. Requiring attendance for 
a specified number of days or for a fractional part of the school term 
is generally characteristic of States which have had compulsory 
attendance laws for only a short period. Experience, almost without 
exception, incorporates the full-term proviso. 
School attendance ages.—Figure 44 shows the age at which attend- 
ance at school is permitted and at which it is made obligatory. For 
instance, in Alabama children may attend school at any time from 7 
to 21 years of age. They must attend between the ages of 8 and 12 
years, and they must also attend from 12 to 16 years unless labor 
   
-P-A-G-E-132

permits are secured. The attendance required, however, is limited 
to 60 days each year, as indicated at the center of the back portion 
of the bar. In 9 Statesechildren may be excused from school attend- 
ance at any age for reasons not generally recognized. In other words, 
excuses are authorized which more or less vitiate or nullify the con- 
templated effects of the attendance laws. In Arizona a specially 
appointed board may excuse a child of any age from school attend- 
ance. In Arkansas the county superintendent may excuse from 
attendance any child who is obliged to support a widowed mother. 
In Colorado the county or city superintendent may grant excuses to 
children at any time. In Delaware any child may be excused for 
“urgent reasons.’”’ In Florida a child may not be required to attend

school if agricultural interests demand. In Louisiana an excuse is 
granted to children at any age to work in certain occupations. In 
South Carolina ‘‘extreme poverty”’ legalizes nonattendance. In 
West Virginia the State commissioner of labor or the county super- 
intendent may grant excuses to children of any age. In Wyoming 
attendance is not required of those on whom it would ‘‘work a hard- 
ship.” The ages at which most children in these States are required 
to attend school have been indicated in figure 44 by cross-lines or 
double-hatched bars. 
The central tendency for the United States is expressed by the last 
bar in the diagram, which represents the mode. The most usual age 
at which children are admitted to school is 6 years. In the majority 
of States children may attend school until they reach the age of 21.

In general, children are compelled to go to school from 8 to 14 years 
of age. From 14 to 16 they must secure labor permits or attend 
school. The work-or-attend-school age shown for the various States

Absence permitted.—Figure 45 indicates, the absence granted in 
each State to pupils of compulsory attendance age before such 
absence constitutes an infraction of the law. In 9 States the law 
contains no provision regulating this matter. In 25 States an unex- 
cusable absence of one day or less constitutes an offense. In 3 States 
children may be absent for two days before the attendance laws be- 
come operative upon them. In 8 States three days’ absence is per- 
mitted; in 1 State four days, and in the other 3 States as many as 
five days. The States listed in the groups given above are not all 
equally delinquent in this respect, owing to minor qualifications in 
the law. Thus, Massachusetts permits only; five days’ absence in six 
months and the District of Columbia allows only three days’ absence 
in a half year.

School work required for labor permits—There is a tendency for 
the States to require some educational standard of pupils who apply 
for labor permits and who have passed the usual period when they 
are required to attend school. States are coming more and more te 
adopt a standard which all its future citizens must attain, if they are 
to pass beyond the influencé of the school. In fact, only 16 States 
make no such requirements. Of the remaining States, as exhibited 
in figure 46, 14 require only that children be able to read and write; 
4 require the completion of the fourth grade; 7, the fifth grade; 3, 
the sixth grade; and 5, the completion of the elementary grades. 
Who issues labor permits—There is a decided tendency among the 
States to authorize some one actually engaged in the teaching profes-    
-P-A-G-E-135
  STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 185 
sion to issue labor permits. In 1918, 31 States gave this authority 
ito the school superintendent, to the principal, or to the teachers, in 
case no higher officer was employed. The practice in vogue in 5 
States is to place the issuance of labor permits in the hands of the 
school board, a judge, or an attendance officer. In such cases this 
duty becomes an ex officio performance of an officer chosen primarily 
for some other purpose. In 9 States the school board or a judge acts 
lin this capacity only where a superintendent is not employed. In 
such cases, the jurisdiction becomes alternative. In the other 4 
States labor permits are not necessary. Those generalizations are

Educational exemptions.—There is a decided tendency among the 
States not to exempt children from the operation of the compulsory- 
attendance law, because they have attained some educational 
standard. With the widespread influence of the modern high school, 
the States are finding less ground for exempting those who complete 
the elementary school course. In fact 25 States grant no excuses 
for educational attainments. In all, 21 other States do not grant 
such excuses to children unless they have completed the elementary: 
grades. Colorado requires that the child be 14 years of age and 
have completed the elementary grades before permanent exemption 
is legalized. In 2 States, Georgia and Virginia, any child who has 
completed the fourth grade may be thereafter exempt from school 
attendance. The requirement in each State is shown in figure 48.

Who enforces the attendance law.—There is a growing tendency 
among the States to place the enforcement of the compulsory- 
attendance law in the hands of an officer appointed specially for this 
purpose. Such officer is usually called the truant or attendance 
officer. In 1918, 22 States vested the enforcement of the law with 
such officer, who usually acts under the direction of the superin- 
tendent of schools. In 14 States the enforcement of the attendance 
laws is left to some ex officio officer who has been chosen primarily 
for some other work. In 13 other States such ex officio officers act 
only when no attendance officer is employed. The requirement for 
each State is exhibited in figure 49.

Regularity of attendance required.—Almost unanimous practice pre- 
vails among the States regarding the continuity of school attendance. 
Although a child may be required to attend for only 120 days, it is 
of utmost importance that such attendance be consecutive. Already 
42 States have incorporated this requirement in their attendance 
laws. In Alabama the school board determines when children must. 
attend school. In 6 States, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah, 
Virginia, and West Virginia, regular attendance at school is not 
required. No State which enacted its initial legislation on compul- 
sory attendance over 30 years ago does not now require consecutive 
attendance. In other words, after 30 years’ trial a State invariably 
requires that children attend school regularly.

POPULATION OF GROUPS. 
This report presents the statistics of city public schools for the 
school year 1917-18. An attempt has been made for the first time 
to secure statistics from all cities which had a population of 2,500 or 
overin 1910. The cities have been divided into five groups: Group I, 
including all cities with a population of of 100,000 and over; Group 
II, all cities having a population of 30,000 or over but less than 100,- 
000; Group III, all cities with a population of 10,000 or over but less 
than 30,000; Group IV, all cities with a population of 5,000 or over 
but less than 10,000; and Group V, all cities having a population of 
2,500 or over, but less than 5,000. The first two groups correspond 
to the five groups of cities from which the Bureau of the Census an- 
nually collects statistics on all expenditures for city government. 
To bring about this uniformity in these reports the lower limit of the 
second group has been changed in this report from 25,000 population 
to 30,000. Consequently, this group does not include as many cities 
as it did in similar preceding reports, while Group III includes a cor- 
respondingly larger number of cities. This report contains detailed 
statistics only for cities having a population of 10,000 and over. 
Preceding reports contained corresponding detailed statistics for the 
cities of Group IV as well. Previous to this report no attempt was 
made to secure statistics from the cities of Group V. Many of these 
smaller urban communities do not have a separate municipal school 
system, and it is often difficult for some of them to report facts 
relating to school finances. 
For all cities not reporting, estimates have been made either indi- 
vidually or in the aggregate, so that the summary tables represent 
as accurately as could be ascertained the urban school statistics for 
the whole country. The various reports of the State superintendents 
of public instruction were of great value in furnishing a basis for 
making estimates in many instances. In several cases the estimates 
207

  208) BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
have been based upon the total population of the places not reporting 
in proportion to the corresponding per capitas for similar places 
reporting. Knowing the State school statistics and the city school 
statistics, the rural school statistics can be easily ascertained. It 
must be understood that the term ‘‘rural’’ as here employed includes 
all schools not under the control of a city, or not in a municipality of 
2,500 population or over. Rural school statistics will be Presented 
in the review chapter of the Biennial Survey.

  Revised schedules were used in gathering the statistical data used 
in this report. They are somewhat similar to those previously em- 
ployed in collecting data for similar reports, but slight changes were 
made. This report contains more detailed information than did 
former reports about school bonds and the means of liquidating them; 
tax rates, and the assessed valuation of property, night schools, 
junior high schools, the number of schools maintained, the length of 
the school term, and the enrollment of pupils by age and grade. 
This report is inferior to preceding reports in that so many cities could 
not completely separate expenditures for. the different types of 
schools, such as elementary and secondary schools, that no attempt 
has been made to do so except in the cost of instruction, as this ex- 
pression is technically used. In the analysis of school costs, however,
-P-A-G-E-213
  
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 213 
dependable figures have been deduced relative to the total cost of 
elementary and secondary schools in the different groups of cities. 
HISTORICAL STATISTICS. 
In other chapters of the Biennial Survey for 1918 an attempt has 
been made to show increases or decreases in statistical data from 
year to year and to establish trends. Such analyses are not so valu- 
able, however, for a city school report as for reports from individual 
schools of the various types. In the first place, the list of cities in 
each group changes with each decennial census, thereby essentially 
vitiating comparisons which might be made for longer periods. 
Second, this report includes statistics of cities having a population 
less than 5,000 as well as those of the larger municipalities appearing 
in corresponding preceding reports. Third, the groups of cities in 
preceding reports are often not the same as those employed herein. 
Fourth, the influx of the rural population to urban centers tends to 
exaggerate city school progress when totals are compared for different 
years. To eliminate all these factors from consideration for a long 
period of years would be an endless task, one not yielding sufficient 
fruit to justify the cost of pruning. Further, it is doubtful if aggre- 
gate city school statistics covering a period of years are so valuable as 
the corresponding statistics for individual cities. In other words, 
the history of individual city school systems is more valuable than a 
history of all municipal school systems combined. To give indi- 
vidual histories is likewise beyond the scope of this limited study. 
This report, as well as preceding similar reports, forms an excellent 
basis, however, for making such comparative studies for such 
cities as have submitted consistent reports from year to year. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Altogether, 2,401 separate school systems are maintained by cities 
having a population of 2,500 and over. Of these, 51 are in Group I, 
141 in Group II, 420 in Group III, 627 in Group IV, and 1,162 in 
Group V. From these figures it is seen that 48.4 per cent of the 
cities are in Group V._ The inclusion of this group of cities in this 
report has just about doubled the amount of work necessary to 
collect, tabulate, and interpret the data. 
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
The total number of buildings used for school purposes in 1918 
was 20,843. Almost one-fourth of these, or 4,970, are in cities of 
Group I, 3,334 in Group II, 4,260 in Group III, 3,884 in Group IV, 
and 4,395 in Group V. So far as school buildings are concerned, 
they are about equally divided among the five groups of cities. The 
number of city school buildings (18, 974) shown in the report on 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
State school systems was prepared before all city schools had sub- 
mitted reports, and is too small by 1,869 buildings. Altogether, 
there were 276,827 school buildings in the United States in 1918. 
The number of city school buildings constitutes only 7.5 per cent of 
the total number of public school buildings in the United States, 
The total value of these school buildings is 63.5 per cent of the value 
of all such buildings. 
The total value of school property in all city school systems is 
$1,258,933,000, or an average value of $60,401 per school building. 
The average value of a school building for the whole country is 
$7,165. The average value of a ‘“‘rural” school building is only 
$2,831. This average includes, of course, the buildings in villages 
having a population under 2,500 and also all rural high-school build- 
ings. 
The cities in 1918 were asked to report the total number of schools 
in operation; a high school and an elementary school, although 
housed in the same building, being counted as separate schools. 
Omitting kindergartens, altogether 21,260 city schools were reported. 
This number is only about 2 per cent greater than the number of 
school buildings reported. This condition implies that separate city 
school buildings usually house separate schools. In the cities of the 
first four groups there are 14,134 elementary schools, 1,650 secondary 
schools, and 453 special schools. The total number of schools of all 
kinds in the cities of Group V was 5,013, but they were not suffi- 
ciently separated into elementary, secondary, and special schools to 
warrant tabulation in these divisions. The number of secondary 
schools in the first four groups (1,650) is not essentially different 
from the number of high schools (1,385) classed as ‘‘city” in the 
high-school chapter of the Biennial Survey. 
THE TEACHING STAFF. 
Altogether, 2,512 superintendents and assistant superintendents, 
5,071 supervisors, and 8,846 principals are employed in city school 
systems. These are distributed among the five groups of cities in 
Table 1. 
Tn all the cities 241,382 teachers are employed who give half or 
more than half of their time to teaching. Of these, 216,319 are 
women and 25,063 are men. It is seen, therefore, that 10.4 per cent 
of the teachers in city schools are men. The corresponding per- 
centage in 1910 was only 8.7, and in 1890 only 8.2 per cent. These 
percentages are considerably lower than the corresponding ones for 
both urban and rural schools combined—34.5 per cent in 1890, 21.1 
per cent in 1910, and 16.1 per cent in 1918. For the whole Nation 
the proportion of men teachers has decreased, while in city schools 
the proportion has increased slightly. It is found that 37.1 per cent
-P-A-G-E-215
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 215 
of the teachers in the country are employed in city public schools. 
These teachers teach 41.2 per cent of the children.

          THE TEACHING LOAD.     The total number of pupils divided by the total number of teachers 
gives what is technically known as the ‘‘teaching load.’’ The num- 
ber of superintendents, supervisors, and principals employed does not 
enter into this average. The average teaching load in all city schools 
| is35.6. This average, however, does not possess the significance that 
a bird’s-eye view of a graphic distribution conveys. When all groups 
of cities are combined and distributed according to the average 
teaching load in each, as pictured in figure 1, it is found that 261 
cities have 31 or 32, 242 have 33 or 34, and 251 have 35 or 36 pupils 
to a teacher. These three groups, representing 39 per cent of all 
school systems reporting, have a teaching load varying from 31 to 
36 pupils. The distribution is very symmetrical—the bars decreas- 
ing quite regularly in length on the opposite sides of the three central 
bars. 
The variation in the teaching load for the five separate groups of 
cities is exhibited in the second part of the diagram. The middle 
half of the cities has been indicated by the cross-lined area extending

significant that the middle halves and the medians are practically

     the same for each group of cities. The general practice, therefore, 
is for half the cities in each group to havo a teaching load varying 
from 29 to 39, or coming within a range of 11.          
   PUPILS. 
     In all city public schools there are 8,586,601 pupils enrolled, of 
whom 4,239,467 are boys and 4,347,134 are girls. The city schools 
-enroll, therefore, 41.2 per cent of all the public school children in 
the country. In addition to the figures given above, it is estimated 
that 1,021,127 children were enrolled in city private and parochial 
schools, The cities of Group I enroll 43 per cent of these public 
school pupils; of Group II, 16.8 per cent; of Group ITI, 16.5 per cent; 
of Group IV, 11.8 per cent; and of Group V, 11.9 per cent. Only 
in the cities of the first group does the proportion of boys exceed that 
of girls. In the cities of the first four groups about 81.1 per cent of 
all pupils are enrolled in the elementary schools, 12.2 per cent in high 
schools, 5.3 per cent in kindergartens, and 1.4 per cent in special 
schools. The proportion registered in high schools is significant, 
since for the whole country only 9.3 per cent of the total enrollment 
is found in high schools, the rural statistics bringing down the average. 
As the cities of Group V did not report high-school enrollment the 
exact rural-school statistics on this point can not be ascertained.

LENGTH OF THE CITY SCHOOL TERM. 
In Table 87 the length of the school term in individual cities for 
each type of school maintained is given. From the detailed data a 
general conception as to the length of the school term can scarcely 
be obtained. Accordingly, the results have been summarized in 
Table 3 in the form of a distribution table for each group of cities. 
The average length of the school term for all types of schools in a 
city school system has been used in compiling this table and in con- 
structing figure 2. As little difference exists in the length of school 
term for the cities of the different groups, no attempt has been made
-P-A-G-E-219
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 219 
to present the distribution separately for each group of cities in 
graphic form. The diagram shows the distribution of 1,762 cities 
according to the average length of the school term in each. It is 
found that 39 per cent of these cities had a term varying from 176 
to 180 days. As this percentage greatly exceeds that for any other 
similar group, it is evident that a nine-months’ school term is main- 
tained by most cities. Over 25 per cent of the cities have a term 
varying from 181 to 190 days, indicating a nine-and-a-half months’ 
term. Almost’8 per cent of the cities have a longer term, ranging 
from 191 to 200 days, indicating a 10 months’ school term in these 
cities. A very small percentage of cities have a shorter term than 
8 months or 160 days. 
The length of the school term is determined by dividing the aggre- 
gate attendance, i. e., the total number of days attended by all pupils, 
by the average daily attendance. According to this method of com- 
putation, all cities have been put on the same basis, and the diagram 
probably represents conditions as they actually are. If the total 
aggregate attendance for all cities reporting the data is divided by 
the total average daily attendance in the same cities, an average of 
182 days is secured. This number represents the average length of 
the city school term in the United States. This average is consider- 
ably higher than the corresponding average for all public elementary 
and secondary schools in the United States, which is almost 161 days. 
In other words the average city school term is about one month 
longer than the average term for all schools combined. 
The average pupil enrolled in the city public schools attends only 
143 days out of the 182 days of schooling provided. He wastes, 
therefore, 39 days or almost 2 months of schooling annually. This 
percentage of waste in city schools, 21.4 per cent, is not quite so 
large as the corresponding percentage of waste for the whole country, 
25.4 per cent. 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In 1918, 292 city school systems maintained junior high schools. 
Altogether, 431 junior high schools are in existence—76 in Group I, 
90 in Group IT, 93 in Group IIT, 102 in Group IV, and 70 in Group V. 
In these schools, 1,077 men and 4,468 women teachers are em- 
ployed. Altogether, 158,108 children are enrolled in these 431 junior 
high schools, including 75,013 boys and 83,095 girls. The chapter 
on public high schools includes a report from 557 junior high schools, 
some of them being maintained as a part of rural or village school 
systems. These 557 schools enrolled only 116,197 pupils, 54,513 
boys and 61,684 girls. Considerable editing was done on the high- 
school reports to eliminate the schools organized only for depart- 
mental teaching. As the city report does not contain much de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  220 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
  tailed information about junior high schools, no attempt has been 
made to reject those schools offering only departmental teaching in 
the elementary grades. The interpretation of the term ‘junior high 
school,’ as used in this report, has rested, therefore, with the various 
city school superintendents. A uniform rigid construction of the 
term might have reduced considerably the statistics of city junior 
high schools appearing herein. It is possible that the special high- 
school report does not include the statistics of all city junior high 
schools, as only those junior high schools were reported which were 
more or less closely connected with senior high schools in the same 
school system. Probably many separately organized junior high 
schools were not included in that chapter of the Biennial Survey. 
It is believed, therefore, that the statistics of city junior high schools 
are fairly reliable and complete, although strict uniformity was not 
possible in editing the reports.

THE “TEACHING LOAD’’ IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
It is of special interest to school administrators to know the teach- 
ing load in junior high schools. The average teaching load is de- 
termined by dividing the total junior high-school enrollment by 
the total number of teachers in such schools. It has little signifi- 
cance as to the average size of junior high-school classes. This teach- 
ing load has been determined for each group of cities and for all 
groups combined, as shown in Table 4. Only the totals for all cities
-P-A-G-E-221
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 221 
have been used in the construction of figure 3. It is seen in the figure 
that the usual number of students to a teacher varies from 25 to 35. 
A few cities have unusually high teaching loads, even exceeding 50 
pupils to a teacher. On the other hand, some cities have fewer than 
20 pupils to a teacher in such schools.

third group 26 to 37; in the fourth group 26 to 38; in the fifth group © 
from 24 to 36; and in all groups combined from 25 to 36 pupils to a 
teacher. These middle halves probably best characterize the dis- 
tribution of the teaching load.

222 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
AN AGE-AND-GRADE STUDY OF A MILLION PUPILS IN 80 CITY SCHOOL | 
SYSTEMS. 
SCOPE OF THE STUDY. 
In 1918 a number of cities reported a classification of their pupils 
by age and grade. Each city reporting such facts might have been 
included in this analysis, but such a study becomes more valuable if 
present achievement can be compared with past accomplishment 
under similar conditions. In order to measure change, similar data 
must be used for the different years compared. Without comparison, 
facts lack significance. In 1908 the enrollment of pupils by age and 
grade in a number of cities was collected by Strayer, and a study of the 
data secured at that time was published in 1911.1. A comparison of 
the reports received in 1908 and in 1918 revealed the fact that only 
80 cities supplied corresponding data for these two periods. No city, 
however, which had only seven grades in the elementary school at 
either date has been included in this report, since such inclusions 
would. vitiate desired comparisons. On the other hand, no city 
reporting nine grades in the elementary school in 1918 has been in- 
cluded. <A few cities (9) having nine grades in the elementary school 
in 1908 have been included, but the number of pupils in the ninth 
grade in these cities was so small in 1908 that general results are not 
materially affected by their inclusion. It is believed that, from a 
study of these 80 cities, a series of reliable norms for all cities has 
been established. In other words, any other city can secure the en- 
rollment of its pupils by age and grade and check its percentages 
with those for these 80 cities. 
THE CITY GROUPS. 
  Of the 80 cities chosen for study, 42 had a population of 25,000 or 
over in 1900, and 38 had a population of less than 25,000 on the same 
date. This classification was used by Strayer in 1908, and conse- 
quently the division is based on the 1900 census, instead of the 1910 
census. Five of the larger cities had a population exceeding 100,000 
in 1910—Chicago, Fall River, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Phila- 
delphia. The 42 larger cities are frequently referred to in the fol- 
lowing pages as cities of ‘group A” and the 38 smaller cities as 
those of ‘group B.” The total enrollment in-the elementary. and 
secondary schools in cities of group A is almost nine times as great as 
the corresponding enrollment in cities of group B. When medians 
are used in the studies, each city contributes to the result an equal 
weight, regardless of its size. When arithmetical averages are used, 
the largest cities greatly outweigh the smaller ones and largely control 
the averages when both groups are combined. The medians, there-

  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 228 
fore, characterize city school practices, while the averages denote 
the status of individual pupils in urban school systems. The first 
looks toward the school system, the second toward the individual 
pupil. Both central tendencies must be used to convey definite 
concepts of the situation. 
THE AGE-GRADE GROUPS. 
As defined by Strayer for 1908, the children in the first grade who 
are 6 or 7 years of age are considered of normal age, those under 6 as 
under age, and those over 7 as over age. Similarly, in the second 
grade those who are 7 or 8 years of age are considered of normal age, 
those under 7 as under age, and those over 8 as over age. In like 
manner the succeeding grade groups have been determined. The 
same method of grouping has been used for both years, 1908 and 1918. 
In the following study the under-age pupils are frequently referred to 
as “accelerated” children and the over-age pupils as “retarded” 
children or ‘‘repeaters.’”’ It should be remembered in this connection 
that under-age children may have entered school earlier than usual 
and may have advanced regularly from grade to grade. The under- 
age group might even include repeating children under extraordinary 
circumstances. Presumably, most of the under-age children have 
advanced more rapidly than is ordinarily done. On the other hand, 
over-age children are probably “repeaters,” though some of them 
may have entered school later than usual and may have advanced at 
anormalrate. At any rate, these children are too old for their grade; 
they are doing work of a lower character than children of their ages 
usually do. They are retarded for their age, though they may not be 
repeaters. Even children in the normal age groups may have re- 
peated one year of work. It should be carefully noted that this 
study presents facts of under-agedness and over-agedness and not 
precise data regarding rates of progress from grade to grade. It is 
clearly shown in figure 26 that, in the first grade at least, the number 
of repeaters exceeds both the under-age and over-age pupils combined. 
In certain cities where children are allowed to enter the first grade 
at the age of 5, the age-grade groups chosen are too high. Such cities 
will show rather high percentages of under-age children. The age- 
grade groups employed, however, are the best ones that could have 
been used, since in the first and eighth grades the percentages of 
children over age and under age are almost equal, respectively, as 
shown in figure 16. To have selected other age groups to indicate 
normality would have materially disturbed the relative positions of 
the two curves in this figure and would have resulted in more harm 
“than good.

A CLASSIFICATION 
                OF CITIES ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE OF 
OVER-AGE PUPILS. 
For each of the 80 cities chosen for study the percentages of pupils 
under age, of normal age, and over age, have been ascertained. The 
cities have been ranked by groups (A and B) on the decreasing per- 
centages of over-age pupils or on the combined increasing percentages 
of under-age and normal-age pupils. Thus in figure 4 it is shown 
that Quincy, Mass., has the smallest percentage (7.7) of over-age 
pupils of any city in group A. At the other end of the array is Kan- 
sas City, Kans., with 37.8 per cent of its pupils over age. About 
half of these cities have one-fifth of their pupils in the over-age class. 
Fall River, Mass., has the highest percentage (30.4) of under-age 
pupils, and Dayton, Ohio, has the highest percentage (83) of pupils 
of normal age in this group of cities.

    230 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
THE COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION AND THE COEFFICIENT OF RE- 
GRESSION FOR THREE TYPICAL AGE-GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS, 
An inspection of figure 5 might lead one to believe that little 
relationship exists between the age and grade of pupils in certain 
cities. For instance, what is the relationship between the age and 
grade of pupils in Dedham, Mass., where the proportion of under- 
age pupils is very large, and in Goshen, Ind., where only a negligible 
percentage of pupils is under age, but where a comparatively large 
percentage of pupils is of normal age? In the former city pupils 
enter school at the age of 5, while in the latter city they do not enter 
until the age of 6. It is hardly fair, therefore, to measure these 
cities by the standard proposed above. A better conception as to 
the relationship between the age and grade of pupils in these cities 
is gained from the coefficients of correlation and regression. An 
inspection of the age-grade tables (A and B) for these cities discloses 
a certain similarity, there being comparatively few ages represented 
in any grade or relatively few grades enrolling pupils of any given 
age. The ‘‘compactness” of these distributions is in striking con- 
trast to the ‘‘scattered” distribution of pupils in the age-grade 
table for Donora, Pa. Let us proceed to measure these distributions 
by the coefficients of correlation and regression. 
The coefficient of correlation is usually expressed as follows: 
__2G@-y)__%(-y) 
yae? \dy? no, op 
A shorter method of computing this coefficient is proposed by Ayres? 
as follows:   
Sum of products of subject and relative items 
minus 
Av. of subject items x total of relative items 
  
  ini aca 
Sum of squares of subject ‘Sum of squares of relative 
items items 
minus minus © 
Av. X total of these items. Av. xX total of these items. 
This formula has been employed in computing r in Tables A, B, and 
C. The coefficient of correlation for Dedham is found to be 0.949 
and that for Goshen 0.947, while that for Donora is only 0.906. 
The first two coefficients indicate practically the same relationship 
between the age and grade of pupils in Dedham and in Goshen. 
It is seen, therefore, that a very close and essentially equal corre-

lation between age and grade exists.in Dedham and Goshen. 
The differences so apparent in figure 5 are undoubtedly due to the 
fact that children enter school earlier in Dedham than in Goshen, 
one school system being graded about as well as the other. In 
Donora the coefficient is comparatively low, indicating that pupils 
having a wide range of ages will be found in each grade, 
If all the pupils in Goshen who are 6 years of age were in the first 
grade; those 7 years of age, in the second grade; those 8 years of age, 
in the third grade, etc., the correlation between age and grade would 
be perfect and positive and the coeflicient (r) would equal 1. On 
the other hand, if all pupils entered school in the twelfth grade and 
were regularly demoted the correlation between age and grade would 
be perfect but negative, and the coefficient (r) would equal —1. 
If all pupils remain in the first grade the coefficient is indeterminate, 
0/0. As age-grade distributions usually have high positive coeffi- 
cients, it may be said that the coefficient for Donora (0.906) is rela- 
tively low. 
The coefficient of regression tells a more significant story con- 
cerning the average rate of progress of pupils through the grades. 
This coefficient is found by dividing the numerator of the Ayres 
formula for r by the quantity under the second radical. 
The coefficient of regression for Dedham is 0.922; for Goshen, 
0.883; and for Donora, 0.795. These coefficients show what frac- 
tional part of a grade the average pupil advances for each addi- 
tional year of age. Again the coefficients for Dedham and Goshen 
are essentially equal, indicating that the average pupil makes about 
nine-tenths of a grade a year. In Donora the corresponding rate of 
progress is less than eight-tenths of a grade a year.

  284 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
PUPILS UNDER AGE, OF NORMAL AGE, AND OVER AGE IN 1908 AND IN 
1918. 
From the preceding figures it is not possible to gain a general con- 
cept as to the per cent of pupils under age, of normal age, and over 
age. These relationships are best exhibited in Table 6 and in figure 
6, where the corresponding percentages for 1908 and 1918 are placed

in juxtaposition. The changes within this interval are shown for the 
two groups of cities separately and combined, for boys and girls, and 
for all pupils. The per cent of the under-age pupils in cities of 
group A has increased about threefold, while in cities of group B the 
corresponding increases have not been so marked. In every instance, 
however, the per cent of under-age pupils has increased. Likewise,  
-P-A-G-E-235
  ' STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 235 
he proportion of children of normal age has increased for each group 
f cities and for both boys and girls. There has been a greater 
mcrease in the proportion of boys than of girls of normal age. These 
creases imply that the percentage of over-age pupils has decreased 
orrespondingly. These facts are illustrated by the last column of 
ars in the diagram. The changes pointed out in this figure are 
ighly significant. The school work offered to-day must come more 
early meeting the developing mental capacities of children than did 
he curricula 10 years ago. These commendable changes denote 
mistakable progress in dealing with the problem of over-age pupils. 
t should be remarked that the percentages shown in figure 6 are 
verages—not medians. Thus for each 100 pupils enrolled in city 
chools in 1918, 12 were under age, 67 were of normal age, and 21 
ere over age. In 1908 out of each 100 pupils so enrolled, 4 were 
der age, 58 were of normal age, and 38 were over age. Within 
the last 10 years the proportion of under-age pupils has trebled, 
while the proportion over age has been almost cut in two (reduced 
rom. 38 to 21). 
If it is desired to characterize city school practices an inspection 
of the corresponding median percentages must be made. In 
Table 6 and figure 7 these median percentages are exhibited. Con- 
sider, for instance, the first two series of bars in cities of group A, 
representing “boys’”’ in 1908 and in 1918. At the former date as 
many cities had a proportion of under-age boys exceeding 3.6 as 
had a proportion less than this percentage, while in 1918 the corre- 
sponding median percentage was 11.5. In these instances an extra 
large city counts no more than a small city in the determination of the 
median. In a similar manner it is shown that as many cities had in 
1908 more than 55.3 per cent of their pupils of normal age as had a 
smaller percentage, while in 1918 the corresponding divisional 
percentage had increased to 64.2. Within the same interval the 
median percentages of over age pupils were reduced from 39.4 per 
cent to 22.9 per cent. In a similar manner the other medians 
shown in the diagram may be interpreted. A marked difference 
between medians and averages is apparent in the cities of group B. 
Little change has been made in this group within the 10-year period 
in the average percentages of under-age pupils, but considerable 
change has taken place in the corresponding median percentages. 
An analysis of the percentage of over-age pupils is exhibited in 
Table 6 and figure 8. It is found that the percentage of pupils 
retarded one year exceeds the percentage retarded two years, ‘three 
years, or for a longer period. Approximately half of the over-age 
pupils are only one year over age. In this diagram both averages 
and medians are shown. Ordinarily they are not essentially differ-

The black bars represent arithmetical averages only. For all 
cities combined in 1908 ent. 
    20.7 per cent of the pupils were retarded ?

It is seen, therefore, from these percentages that the greatest reduc-

are decidedly over age. Marked reductions have taken place, 
however, in each over-age group within this 10-year interval. By

240 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
comparing the bars representing the two groups of cities, it is found 
that larger percentages of over-age pupils are found in the cities of 
group A than in the cities of group B. It will be observed also that 
the percentages of over-age boys are invariably greater than the 
corresponding percentages of over-age girls. In every instance the 
percentages are less in 1918 than they were in 1908. As in the 
two preceding figures, the medians represent city practices, while 
the averages stand for the retardation of individual pupils enrolled 
in city schools. The relationship of the “bars” and “pins’’ in this 
diagram is significant. Thus in group A cities for boys in 1908 the 
median is less than the average percentage, indicating that the larger 
cities of this group had greater percentages of boys retarded one 
year than did the smaller cities of this class. In 1918 the reverse 
condition is shown, the larger cities having the smaller percentages 
of children one year over age. The larger cities of group A have 
made greater progress during this 10-year period in reducing the 
proportion of pupils one year over age than have the smaller cities 
of the same group. 
PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF PUPILS BY AGES. 
In Table 7 and figure 9 the percentage distribution of the total 
number of pupils of each age in 1908 and in 1918 is shown. At first 
glance the two curves appear somewhat similar in structure. A closer 
inspection reveals the fact that the curve for 1918 has shifted slightly 
to the left. The cause of this displacement is due to the fact that a 
larger percentage of children 5, 6, and 7 years of age is enrolled in 
school in 1918 than was enrolled in 1908. This situation partly 
explains the large increases in the percentage of under-age pupils since 
1908, as pointed out in figures 6 and 7. The large increases in the 
percentage of under-age pupils, therefore, is not wholly due to a 
greater flexibility in school curricula, thereby permitting pupils to 
advance from grade to grade as soon as they have mastered the 
required subject matter, but partly due to the earlier enrollment of 
children in school. This tendency for children to enter school earlier 
reduces correspondingly the percentage of over-age children. Too 
. much credit, therefore, should not be assigned, to enriched curricula 
or to better teaching in explaining the reduction in the percentage of 
over-age pupils. 
Another very significant tendency is portrayed in this figure. 
There has been a decided decrease in the percentage of pupils 11, 12, 
and 13 years of age within this 10-year period. This condition may 
imply that over-age pupils are dropping out of school at these ages. 
This theory is supported by the fact that the percentage of over-age 
pupils deereased rapidly at these ages, as shown in figure 26, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918. 241 
further by the fact that most compulsory attendance laws become - 
less effective at these ages. During the high-school ages, 14 to 18, 
the two curves in figure 9 are not essentially different. 
In 1908 the largest percentages of children in school are found to 
be 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years of age, while in 1918 the largest percent- 
ages are enrolled at the ages of 7,8,9,and 10. The average of these 
age groups probably best represents the number of beginning pupils,?

the detailed survival percentages is to employ a number characteriz- 
ing only one age group, which is higher than all the other age groups 
represented. From this figure it is clearly evident that the age 
groups to be employed can only be determined by ascertaining which 
ones are essentially equal in magnitude. In neither case can a single 
number derived from the fullest age groups represent the number of 
pupils beginning at earlier dates, since each succeeding statistical 
generation is larger than the one which preceded it.

CHANGE IN THE PROPORTION OF PUPILS UNDER AGE, OF NORMAL AGE, 
AND OVER AGE SINCE 1908, 
In figure 10 the 80 cities studied have been distributed according 
to the percentage of under-age pupils. In 1908 it was customary 
for cities to have only 2 or 3 per cent of under-age pupils. At any 
rate more cities had these percentages than any others. There seems 
to be little difference between the percentages of boys and girls who 
are under age. In 1918 no single percentage seems to characterize

In figure 11 the 80 cities have been distributed according to the 
percentage of boys and girls of normal age. In 1908 the largest num- 
ber of cities (mode) had from 50 to 51 per cent of their boys of normal 
age. In 1918 the mode for boys had shifted to the percentage group, 
62 to 63. For girls in 1908 the mode was in the percentage group 60 to 
61, while in 1918 the most usual percentage was 70 to 71. In general 
in this figure the black curves for 1918 fall to the right of the dotted 
curves for 1908. These changes unmistakably indicate that school 
curricula are coming more and more to conform to the chronological 
if not to mental age of the pupils. Even if children do enter school 
earlier than they did 10 years ago, such a condition does not vitiate 
this fact. If earlier entrance at school results in an increase in the 
percentage of children, both under age and of normal age and reduces 
the percentage of children over age, the practice is surely commend- 
able. The chronological age of children and the curriculum are be- 
coming more closely harmonized as the percentage of children of nor- 
mal age increases.

The reduction in the percentage of over-age pupils since 1908 is 
pictured in Tables 10, 11, 12, and 13, and in figures 12, 13, 14, and 15. 
In every instance in the diagrams the mode has shifted to the left for 
both boys and girls. The general reduction in the percentage of over- 
age pupils is conducive to better teaching. In some of the cities 
these over-age pupils have been segregated from the younger pupils 
of their grades and placed in special schools and classes. The subtle 
suggestion incident to a study of this kind is that cities which have 
not provided special work for retarded or subnormal pupils should 
do so if the proportion of over-age. pupils justifies such a venture. 
In view of the norms established in this study, each city superintend- 
ent should carefully analyze the status of the pupils in his school 
system to determine whether special classes should be provided for 
the over-age children. A study of special schools and classes for the 
subnormal children is found in another chapter of this Biennial 
Survey of Education.

OVER-AGE AND UNDER-AGE PUPILS, BY GRADES. 
The degree of retardation or acceleration is not more important 
than the location of the irregularity in grade distribution. Accord- 
ingly, the under-age and over-age pupils in each city have been 
retabulated to show in what grades retardation and acceleration 
accumulate. The results of this study for 1918 are summarized by 
means of arithmetical averages in figure 16. R oy .

Fig, 16.—Average percentage of pupils over age and under age in 80 cities in 1917-18. 
Corresponding data for 1908 had not been ascertained. The 
smallest percentage of over-age pupils is found in the first grade, 
and the highest percentage in the fifth grade, where over 30 per 
cent of the pupils are retarded. In the seventh and eighth grades 
the percentages decrease rapidly. This decided drop is undoubtedly 
due to the decreasing effectiveness of compulsory attendance laws at 
the ages of 13 and 14. Where extraneous factors do not operate 
decreases or increases are quite regular. In high school, for instance, 
the decreasing percentage of over-age pupils is strikingly constant. 
The curves representing the under-age pupils takes almost a straight 
course, varying only slightly and always in an opposite direction to 
the course taken by the curve representing over-age pupils. In
-P-A-G-E-255

other words, as one curve rises the other falls and vice versa. Under- 
lagedness seems to accumulate with each grade above the fourth, 
each successive grade contributing its quota to the accelerated groups. 
The fact that the curves cross at the first and eighth grades indicates 
that the age-grade groups previously chosen are the most typical of 
the age-grade distribution.. To have chosen the ages 5 and 6 as nor- 
mal for the first grade would have increased materially the per- 
centage of over-age pupils and decreased almost to zero the percent- 
age of under-age pupils. To have chosen the ages 7 and 8 as normal 
for this grade would have had the opposite effect of increasing the 
percentage of under-age pupils and decreasing the percentage of 
over-age pupils. Similar conditions would have prevailed in the 
other grades if corresponding disturbances in the grade groups had 
been made.

                    The median percentages of over-age and under-age pupils for each 
group of cities and for both groups combined are exhibited in figure 
17. There is a greater percentage of over-age pupils in the cities of 
group A than in the smaller cities of group B in all grades except the 
eighth and the first-year high school. In the larger cities some 
force seems to operate to draw the over-age pupils in these two 
grades out of school. Economie conditions are perhaps responsible 
for this exodus. The larger cities seem to have, or at any rate to 
succeed in keeping in school until they have reached the sixth or 
seventh grade, alarger percentage of children who are over age than 
do the smaller cities. It is impossible to determine from these 
considerations whether the curricula of the larger cities are more 
unsuited to the boys and girls than those offered by smaller cities, 
whether their compulsory attendance laws are more rigidly enforced, 
or whether the factor of immigration is responsible for the excessive 
number of over-age children in the lower elementary grades. 
On the other hand, the smaller cities have comparatively large 
percentages of under-age children in the elementary grades and 
relatively small percentages of under-age children in the high-school 
grades. A reliable diagnosis of this condition is difficult to make.

    260 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
May encourage rapid advancement from grade to grade and unduly 
increase the proportion of under-age children. The rapid rise in 
the curve representing the larger cities from the fifth grade to the 
first year of high school suggests the plausibility of this explanation. 
At any rate a more flexible program of studies permitting precocious 
children to go forward more rapidly than usual seems to characterize 
the larger city school systems in grades above the fourth or fifth. In 
the lower grades the smaller cities have relatively larger percentages 
of under-age pupils. This fact must indicate that pupils start to 
school earlier in the smaller than in the larger cities. 
The third part of figure 17 is somewhat similar to diagram 16. 
It represents medians, however, and therefore city school practices 
regardless of school enrollment, while the curves in figure 16 represent 
average pupil conditions. The curves representing medians are 
more irregularin outline than those representing arithmetical 
averages. 
In figure 18 the 80 cities studied have been distributed according 
to the percentage of under-age pupils in each grade. In the first 
and second grades the largest group of cities has less than 4 per cent 
of under-age pupils. In the third and fourth grades the most 
characteristic percentage falls in the group 8 to 11. In the fifth and 
eighth grades the most frequent percentages are found in the group 
16to19. In the sixth and seventh grades the most usual percentages 
vary from 8 to 11. In high schools no well defined central tendencies 
or modes are evident. There seems to be, therefore, little uniformity 
among cities as to the percentage of under-age pupils in each year 
of high school. One general tendency for all grades is vaguely 
distinguishable, in that the higher the grade the higher the percent- 
age of under-age pupils. This tendency results from the fact that 
more pupils join the accelerated group each year than go from this 
under-age group to the normal-age or over-age groups. In other 
words, acceleration accumulates. This condition exists because | 
the flexibility of the course of study permits unusually bright chil- 
dren to advance at a supernormal rate from grade to grade. The 
fact that acceleration percentages increase from grade to grade 
suggests that earlier entrance at school may not be wholly respon- 
sible for the increase in the percentage of under-age pupils from 1908 
to 1918. 
In figure 19 the 80 cities have been distributed according to the 
percentage of over-age pupils in each. The greatest number of cities 
have from 8 to 11 per cent of over-age pupils in the first grade. In the 
second grade the mode falls at 16 to 19. In the third grade the mode 
has receded to the 12-15 group; in the fourth grade it has advanced 
to the 24-27 percentage group; while in the fifth grade the mode is

at 28-31; and in the sixth grade at 32-35. Beyond this grade the 
mode recedes, falling at 16-19 in the seventh grade and at 12-15 in 
the eighth grade. In the high school the mode is located in the 16-19 
group for both the first and second years, and in the 8-11 group for 
the third and fourth years. The ‘‘procession” of modes in this dia- 
gram is more or less analogous to the ‘‘over-age” curve shown in 
figure 16. The apex of the curve in figure 16 falls in the fifth grade, 
while in figure 19 the sixth grade had the mode of greatest magnitude. 
This modal practice characteristic of the sixth grade implies that the 
largest group of cities hold their pupils through the sixth grade re- 
gardless of the proportion of over-age children. In figure 30 it is 
shown that more children are found in the sixth grade than began 
five years before.

It is important to know how many children survive to the different 
grades. To ascertain exact data for each of the 80 cities for the two 
dates 1908 and 1918 would have been an onerous task. No single 
number can accurately represent the number of beginning children 
in 12 successive classes. Approximate results, however, can be ob- 
tained by dividing the total enrollment in each grade by the largest 
age group. This is a convenient means of ascertaining fairly com- 
parable percentages for the different cities, although it is generally 
understood that the divisor chosen is too large for most of the

grade groups, especially for the high-school grades. To have used an 
average of the largest age groups would have distributed the inaccu- 
racies over a wider range, reducing the major errors in the upper 
grades, but increasing minor errors in the lower grades.

In figure 20 the percentage relationship between the largest age 
group and the enrollment in the first grade usually exceds 100. If 
this ratio is found to be 150, it means that there are 50 per cent more 
children in the first grade than actually begin. In other words one-

third of the children in this grade would be ‘‘repeaters.”” In a few 
cities this ratio exceeds 200 indicating that half the pupils in this grade 
are ‘‘repeaters.”” For boys in 1908 the modal ratio on this score was 
130-139, but in 1918 it had increased to 140-149. For girls the 
modal ratio in 1918 fell in the group 120-129. For 1908 the corre- 
sponding ratio was not well defined but probably was best typified 
by the percentage group 140-149. On the whole the black curves in 
figure 20 fall to the left of the respective dotted curves, indicating a 
slight reduction in the percentages of pupils repeating the first-grade 
work. The change, however, is not marked, showing that school 
systems have not completely solved the first-grade accumulation 
problem.

In figure 22 it is found that in the fifth grade the modal proportion 
of retarded boys has been reduced, while that for girls has remained 
practically unchanged within this 10-year period. In the sixth grado 
the proportions of boys surviving in 1908 and 1918 are practically the 
same, while the modal survival percentage for girls in 1918 is less than 
that for 1908. In the seventh grade the survival percentages for 
boys and girls have increased slightly, although the mode for girls is 
the same for both periods compared.

  In the eighth grade and in the first and second years of high school 
for both boys and girls, the survival percentages have increased since 
1908. The increase for boys has been most marked, while that for 
girls in the eighth grade and second-year high school has not been so 
pronounced, especially from the standpoint of a shift in the modes.

                    1 Danbury, Conn., and Donora, Pa., did not report a fourth year in their high schools in 1908. 
  In the third year of high school, as exhibited in figure 24, the 
curves for 1918 have shown a decided shift to the right indicating 
that relatively larger percentages of children are now being kept in | 
school than survived to this grade in 1908. For the last year of high 
school the modes are not. distinct. The unbroken black curves, how- 
ever, fall to the right of the dotted curves, clearly showing that 
larger percentages of both boys and girls are surviving to this grade 
than did 10 years ago.

In Table 32 and figure 25 the medians for each group of cities for 
1908 and 1918 for both boys and girls in each grade have been as- 
sembled. This figure, therefore, summarizes the medial central ten- 
dencies exhibited as modes in the four preceding figures. The con- 
notation of the median should be clearly understood at this point. 
In the cities of group A in 1918 it is found that as many cities had more 
than 141 pupils in the first grade for each 100 beginners as had a 
smaller corresponding percentage, a large and a small city being con- 
sidered of equal importance. This diagram, therefore, measures city 
school practices and does not represent the average percentage of 
pupils surviving to each grade in all cities combined. It should also 
be reiterated that these medians are derived from the ratio between 
the enrollment in each grade and the largest age group. The fact 
that very large cities have relatively low survival percentages in the 
upper grades has little effect in drawing the medians down. The 
high-school medial survival percentages, therefore, happen to be 
about correct for the ‘‘average” pupil, as will be shown later.

-P-A-G-E-280
    280 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
In each part of figure 25 a striking improvement is apparent in 
the number of survivors. In the lower grades in 1908 the proportion 
of retarded pupils exceeded the proportion of such pupils in the same 
grades in 1918. In the upper grades the reverse condition prevails, in 
that more pupils are now reaching these advanced grades than did in 
1908. The ‘‘humps”’ in the black curves for 1918 in cities of group B 
show that there are now more pupils in the first year of high school 
than in the eighth grade. This unexpected situation may mean that 
pupils after completing the eighth grade in private schools are entering 
the public schools for secondary school work; that pupils completing 
the elementary school course in rural schools are coming to the city to 
* take up high-school work; or that the number of failures in the first 
year of high school causes an unusual number of retarded pupils to 
be registered in this grade. The data submitted scarcely warrant 
any further deductions in localizing the cause of this irregularity. 
It will be noticed that there is a smaller percentage of retardation 
among girls than among boys in the lower grades, and that a greater 
proportion of girls than boys survive to the upper grades. This 
condition is apparent when one compares the right and left sections 
of corresponding diagrams. 
In Table 32 and figure 26 average survival percentages are shown. 
These percentages relate to individual pupils and not to city school 
practices. With these percentages the corresponding survival per- 
centages of each city should be compared. In this manner any city 
can determine just how it stands as compared with these averages. 
If, for instance, the survival percentage for boys in a given city in 
the fourth year of high school is found to be 10, it is known at once 
that this percentage is low, since, granting the reliability of this 
method of computing survival percentages, the average for all 80 
cities for boys is 13. In a similar manner it is seen that on an aver- 
age 17 girls survive out of each 100 that began 12 years earlier. It 
should be pointed out that these survival percentages for the upper 
grades are too low, since the number in each grade has been divided 
by the largest age group, which is too large to represent the number of 
beginners who have now reached the upper grades. This, however, 
does not vitiate comparisons in any considerable way, since the sur- 
vival percentages of the individual city are probably equally as er- 
roneous as are the final average survival percentages. As in the case 
of corresponding median survival percentages, better conditions are 
shown for 1918 than for 1908. In other words, there are compara- 
tively fewer “‘repeaters” in the lower grades and more “‘survivals”’ 
to the upper grades. This wholesome tendency is unmistakably 
shown in figure 26.

  Fia. 26.—Uncorrected average survival percentages for 89 cities in 1908 and 1918.  
-P-A-G-E-282
282 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  The difference between average and median survival percentages 
is well illustrated in figure 27. The medians and the uncorrected 
averages correspond to those shown in preceding figures, except that 
boys and girls have been combined. By comparing the “dash” 
and the ‘‘dot-dash’”’ curves, it is found that they cross at the sixth 
grade in 1908 and at the seventh grade in 1918. Corresponding 
median survival percentages are less than uncorrected averages in 
the lower grades, about the same in the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades, and greater in the high-school grades. This interchange of 
positions is due to the fact that large cities have unusually high per- 
centages of repeating children in the lower grades and relatively low 
percentages of pupils surviving to the upper grades. 
In Table 32 a series of reliable survival percentages have been com- 
puted on a different basis from that used in securing the correspond- 
ing percentages for individual city school systems. In this table the 
number of beginners has been secured by averaging the largest age 
groups. By this method it is found that in 1908 the first grade had 
65 repeating pupils for each 100 beginning. In 1918 there were only 
53 “repeaters’”’ for the same number beginning. Presumably this 
change took place gradually, and corresponding intermediate per- 
centages have been estimated for the years 1909 to 1917, inclusive. 
Knowing the total enrollment in each grade, the number of beginners 
can easily be ascertained by dividing the first grade enrollment for 
each year represented by the corresponding first grade percentages, 
165 to 153. The estimated number of beginners is now divided into 
the enrollments of the same class on different dates with the result- 
ing survival percentages shown in Table 33, These percentages for 
"1918 (153, 120, 121, 122, 115, 109, 91, 75, 60, 38, 25, and 20) should 
correspond to the ‘‘average’’ percentages (153, 116, 116, 114, 106, 
94, 77, 62, 48, 30, 19, and 15) secured for the respective grades, 1 to 
12, by dividing the total enrollment in each grade by the average of 
the largest age groups. The first series of survival percentages just 
listed are undoubtedly correct, derived as they are by ascertaining 
the number surviving from the different classes as they advance from 
grade to grade. By dividing the percentages in the first series by the 
corresponding percentages in the second series, an array of correction 
factors are secured (1.00, 1.03, 1.04, 1.07, 1.08, 1.16, 1.18, 1.21, 1.25, 
1.27, 1.82, and 1.33). 
From this series it is evident that even if survival percentages are 
obtained by dividing the enrollment in each grade by the average of 
the largest age groups, the results in general are too low. Thus in the 
fourth year of high school a survival percentage obtained in this way 
should be increased by 33 per cent to secure an approximately correct 
percentage. In the third year of high school the corresponding per- 
centage is 32, etc. Using these correction factors a new group of

Fic. 27,—A comparison of median, uncorrected average, and corrected average percentages showing the

-P-A-G-E-284
    "984 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
survival percentages have been secured, as shown in the last part o 
Table 32 and pictured graphically in figure 27. From the curves 
for corrected averages in this figure it is at once apparent that the 
uncorrected averages as ordinarily secured are too low for every grade. 
They are decidedly higher than the medians in the lower grades. In 
the high-school grades the medians and the corrected average sur- 
vival percentages are not essentially different. The proximity of 
these medians to the corrected averages is wholly incidental and is| 
not due to any scientific consideration of the subject. They just 
“happen” to be about right, because they ignore the weights which 
are contributed by the large cities and which should be taken into 
consideration. 
The series of correction factors just described can not be applied to 
the survival percentages ascertained in this report for individual 
cities. It is possible for any city to recompute its survival percent- 
ages by dividing the enrollment in each grade by the average of the 
largest and most nearly equal age groups and to apply the correction 
factors to the quotients thus obtained. This procedure would tell 
approximately how many pupils in a given city actually survive to 
each grade. If only a comparison is desired, the survival percentages 
as ascertained herein for any city may be compared with the uncor- 
rected averages (or with the medians if city practices are to be com- 
pared). The corrected averages reveal the inadequacy of the use 
of the largest age groups or of the average of the largest age groups 
in expressing correct survival relationships. It should be remarked 
in this connection that the curves exhibited in figure 27 relate to 12 
different classes reaching their respective grades in 1918. They do 
not, therefore, purport to give a class history but to portray present 
attainments in school reten tiveness. 
In figure 28 corrected average survival percentages have been com- 
puted for boys and girls separately for each group of cities and for 
all cities combined for both 1908 and 1918. These corrected per- 
centages show that more boys and girls are found in each of the first 
six grades than actually began both for 1908 and 1918. The two 
curves usually cross near the fifth and sixth grades, indicating that 
the percentage of retardation has decreased in the first four grades 
and that the proportion surviving to the last six grades has increased 
within the last 10 years. The high-school survival percentages show 
marked increases within this period. 
A comparison of corrected and uncorrected survival percentages is 
exhibited in figure 29 for each group of cities. For corresponding 
parts the corrected percentages are larger than the uncorrected ones. 
The uncorrected averages shown in this figure are derived by using the 
largest age group as the assumed number of beginners. Correction 
factors have not been computed to show the exact relationships

  990 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916—1918, 
CITY SCHOOL MORTALITY. 
There is probably no better single criterion by which to judge th 
efficiency of a school system than a high percentage of pupils kept i 
school throughout the entire course. Other things being equal, 
school system which keeps one-third of its pupils in school until the 
have reached the fourth year of high school is more efficient than on 
which retains only one-fifth of the children to this advanced grade 
An attempt has been made in Table 33 and figure 30 to arrive at 
series of survival percentages sufficient in scope and reliability t 
characterize city school practice in general. The results are base 
upon a study of over a million children enrolled in 80 city schoo 
systems of various sizes and located in nearly all sections of the coun- 
try. Having corresponding data for these cities for 1908 and 1918 
very reliable survival percentages have been computed. The exac 
method used in eliminating duplicates, in distributing the enrollmen 
by grades, in ascertaining the survival percentages, etc., is explaine 
in Table 33. 
The first part of figure 30 relates to the history of a single class 
which entered school in 1907 and reached the fourth year of hig’ 
school in 1918. The second part of the diagram shows present con- 
ditions for 12 different classes reaching the different grades in 1918. 
Thus, the number surviving to the third grade in 1918 entered) 
school in 1916, and the number in the fourth grade in 1918 entered 
school in 1915. In each diagram the number enrolled in each of the 
first six grades exceeds the number of beginners. In the fourth 
year of high school the number of suvivors is the same in each figure 
since the bars represent the same class. A marked tendency is 
evident when one compares carefully the two diagrams. In the first 
figure the excesses above 100 in the lower grades are greater than the 
. corresponding excesses in the second figure. On the other hand, 
the numbers surviving in the different grades shown in the second 
  figure are greater than the corresponding numbers in the first part’ 
of the diagram. Since the right-hand figure portrays present progress 
and the left-hand figure past practices, it is evident that city schools 
have been reducing retardation in the lower grades and retaining 
relatively more children for work in the higher grades. This com- 
parison shows unmistakable progress in city school success. It 
is very evident that age-grade studies previously made have borne 
fruit. Cities are reducing the proportion of repeaters and increasing 
the proportion of survivals. 
NORMAL-AGE, UNDER-AGE, AND OVER-AGE PUPILS. 
Each bar in the figure has been broken up into three parts, show- 
ing the number of children of normal age, under age, and over age. 
The details of the method used in securing these sections are ex- J

plained in figure 33. Thus, in the first part of the diagram, of the 
166 children enrolled in this grade (compared with the 100 begin- 
ning children) 129 were of normal age, 5 were under age, and 32

    were over age. When this class advanced to the second grade in 
1908, 88 children were of normal age, 4 were under age, and 43 were 
over age.
-P-A-G-E-292
  292 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
In the second diagram, the black bars are comparatively shorter 
than those in the first diagram, indicating that the percentage of 
over-age children has decreased. On the other hand, the single 
hatched sections of the bars in the second part of the diagram are 
comparatively longer than the corresponding sections in the first 
diagram, indicating that children are either entering school earlier 
or are advancing more rapidly through the grades than they did 
several years ago. 
In construing these diagrams, it should be borne in mind that the 
white portion of each bar does not necessarily represent the number 
of pupils advancing regularly from grade to grade. In the first 
grade, the white bar extends above the 100 per cent line in both 
diagrams, indicating that there must be repeaters in this section of 
the bar. Jn other words, in 1907, for each 100 beginners, there 
were 166 pupils enrolled in the first grade. Of these, 66 must be 
repeating the work of this grade. In 1918, for each 100 beginners 
there were 153 pupils in the first grade, 53 of these being repeaters. 
It should also be remembered that the black portion of the bar 
represents over-age pupils, and may include those. who entered 
school at an advanced age, and who may have been promoted regu- 
larly. In like manner, the under-age pupils may have entered 
school earlier than usual, and have advanced at a normal rate of 
progress. The total length of the bar in each case shows the number 
of pupils in each grade for each 100 that began. The accelerated 
pupils reach their grade ahead of time, each class receiving its quota 
from the class entering in previous years, and contributing this 
quota to the class entering in later years. The number of over-age 
pupils can not be ignored since they too have a tendency to advance 
from grade to grade. It is true that they begin to drop off when 
the compulsory attendance law ceases to operate, as will be witnessed 
from the decreasing length of the black sections of the bar beyond 
the sixth grade. In other words, many over-age pupils remain in 
school only because they are obliged to do so. The total length of 
the bar, however, represents the number surviving to each grade.

  294 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916—1918, 
CHILDREN IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL. 
It is important to know how many children are in school and out 
of school at each age. This information is compiled decennially for 
the whole country by the Bureau of the Census. It is equally im- 
portant to show the situation for city school systems of all sizes. 
From the data supplied by city school superintendents and from 
Private school responsibility 20% .

  Fia. 31.—Estimated percentage of children of each age enrolled in the public schools of 80 citiesin 1918. 
census reports, the per cent of children in school at each age in 
these 80 city school systems has been ascertained. The details of 
the method of procedure are shown in Table 35 and the resulting 
percentages are exhibited in graphic form in figure 31. It is found 
that 20 per cent of all city children are enrolled at some age (9 in 
this instance) in private and parochial schools. It may be said, 
therefore, that the private school responsibility is 20 per cent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 295: 
There are no data available to show what proportion of these children 
are enrolled in these private schools at other ages than 9. Assum- 
ing that the percentage of urban children 10 to 14 years of age who 
can not read and write represents the percentage that never attends 
school, it is found that the remaining 77.25 per cent are enrolled 
in city public schools—all of them at the age of 9 and about as many 
at the ages of 7,8, and 10. After the age of 13, children drop out of 
school very rapidly. Few children are enrolled in the first grade at 
the age of 5. Many of them, however, are enrolled in kindergartens 
at this age, but children enrolled in kindergartens have not been 
included in this diagram. The large proportion of children out of 
school above the age of 13 should be sufficient to cause city school 
administrators to pause and diagnose the situation. It is quite 
evident that this drop in attendance is largely due to the ineffective- 
ness of compulsory attendance laws. A preceding diagram showed 
that the percentage of over-age children dropped off rapidly at about 
the same ages. If high schools are maintained at public expense, 
why not compel boys and girls to attend them? Why tax one man 
to educate another man’s children and then permit these children 
to waste the opportunity afforded them? Labor permits encourage 
school mortality, although they may occasionally be a necessity. 
The “concreted” area at the right in the figure constitutes a fertile 
field for night school and continuation school activities, even if 
pupils are obliged to earn a livelihood at these ages. Only 1 per 
cent of a city school’s expenditures goes for the redemption of this 
“dark continent.”

       Value of school property per pupil enrolled , 1917-18. 
Fic. 32.—Distribution of 1,515 cities according to the value of school property per pupil enrolled, 1917-18, 
PER CAPITA VALUE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
Altogether, 1,515 cities reported the total value of school property 
and the total number of students enrolled. From these reports the 
average value of school property for each pupil enrolled has been 
computed. These averages have been classified in Table 55 according 
to the size of cities. The combined summary of the distribution has 
been shown in figure 32, the percentage frequencies of cities being 
used as ordinates and the value of property per pupil as abscissas. 
The highest ordinate represents an average value of property varying 
from $100 to $119. The next longest bar stands for the group $120 
to $139. It is seen, therefore, that over 27 per cent of these cities 
have from $100 to $139 invested in school property for each pupil 
enrolled. A few cities have an average investment exceeding $300. 
On the other hand, a few cities have very low investments, even less 
than $60 per pupil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    B24 ' BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The middle half of cities of Group I have investments ranging from 
$124 to $191, those of Group II from $127 to $188, those of Group 
IIT from $109 to $180, those of Group IV from $94 to $177, and those 
of Group V from $81 to $164, and the middle haif of all cities com- 
bined from $96 to $178. The corresponding medians for these 
respective groups of cities are 162, 155, 144, 131, 114, and 133. It 
is seen, therefore, that the larger cities generally have higher average 
investments per pupil than do the smaller ones. In the report on 
State school systems the average value of school property for both 
urban and rural schools was found to be only $95 per pupil enrolled. 
The medial value of city school property per pupil exceeds, therefore, 
the average for the United States by $38. The corresponding average 
value for city school systems is $147, or $52 more than the carrespond- 
ing average for State school systems. 
THE CITY SCHOOL DEBT. 
The amount of school bonds outstanding in 1,263 city school sys- 
tems in 1918 was $620,133,300. In addition other forms of debt 
amounted to $126,908,200, making a total minimum school indebted- 
ness of $747,041,500. This enormous debt is almost sufficient in 
amount to pay for maintaining the entire public school system of the 
United States for one year ($763,678,089 so spent in 1918) and more 
than twice the amount necessary for meeting for one year the total 
current expenses of city schools ($334,018,175 spent in 1918). If 
city schools should close for two years, and if the revenue could be 
-used in the amortization of school bonds and other debts, including 
accruing interest, they could reopen in the fall of 1920 free from all 
incumbrances. This vast city school debt is more than the corre- 
sponding indebtedness reported by the various State officers of educa- 
tion in 1918 (viz, $469,089,795) for both urban and rural schools 
combined. This great discrepancy means that all the various State 
officers have not succeeded in getting complete returns on the existing 
school debt. This city school debt amounts almost to $87 per pupil 
enrolled in school during the year. 
To meet the interest on this debt the city school systems must raise 
annually $14,635,004 (see Table 82), which seems altogether too small, 
since this amount is less than 2 per cent intérest on the indebtedness. 
To redeem the school bonds as they become due there is now in the 
city school sinking funds only $85,443,100, or 11.4 per cent of the 
amount necessary to liquidate the debt. In 1918, $6,469,384 was 
raised by taxation to redeem accruing bonds, most of which were 
presumably serial bonds. An additional amount of $4,938,662 was 
raised by taxation and transferred to the sinking funds to provide for 
the amortization of other bonds as they mature. Almost an equal 
amount, $4,469,236, was drawn from existing sinking funds to pay
-P-A-G-E-325
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 825 
off bonds maturing in 1918. An additional amount of $5,694,067 
was raised by city school systems to redeem short term loans usually 
negotiated during the preceding school year. 
The total amount raised by city school systems for reducing the 
principal of the school debt during the year was $17,102,113. At 
this rate of reduction it would take cities over 43 years to liquidate 
existing school indebtedness, let alone the new school bonds issued 
annually. In Table 75 it is found that the total amount of new city 
school bonds and loans negotiated during the year 1917-18 was 
$38,076,320. This sum is more than double the amount of the old 
school debts paid off during the same time. In other words, city 
school systems are going into debt more than twice as rapidly as they 
are getting out.

WHERE THE CITY SCHOOL DOLLAR COMES FROM. 
In figure 33 it is shown that 68 per cent of all school revenue, ex- 
cluding nonrevenue receipts, comes from city school taxes, 11.8 
per cent from the State, 11.3 per cent from the general city treasury, 
4.2 per cent from the county, and 4.7 per cent from miscellaneous 
sources. In some cases nearly all city school revenue is appropriated 
out of the general city treasury. Whether such money comes from 
the treasury or from special school taxes, the burden of support rests 
on the the city taxpayer. Combining these two percentages, it is 
found that 79.8 per cent of the city school revenue comes from the 
city itself. An additional 4.2 per cent comes from the county, but 
ordinarily the city pays into the county treasury more than it gets 
back. Likewise, the city generally contributes in State taxes more 
than is returned to it in the nature of an appropriation or allotment, 
Tt is seen, therefore, that the city taxpayer practically supports his 
own school system, although the revenue may come through several 
channels. 
The total city school revenue receipts aggregate $382,542,269, or 
almost 52 per cent of the total revenue receipts ($736,876,442) for  
-P-A-G-E-326
  
  3826 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
State school systems. Over half the money raised for public educa- 
tion goes into the city school treasury. This is significant in view 
of the fact that all city schools register only 8,587,593 children out of 
the 20,853,516 children enrolled in public schools throughout the 
entire country, or a little over 41 per cent of the total number. 
Thus 52 per cent of the school revenue of the Nation is used for 41 
per cent of the children. 
In addition to the revenue receipts, $38,076,320 was received from 
the sale of school bonds and the negotiation of temporary loans and 
$1,149,390 from the sale of school property. The revenue and the 
nonrevenue receipts combined amount to $421,767,979.

CITY SCHOOL TAX RATES. 
An attempt has been made in this chapter to ascertain on a com- 
parable basis a grouping of tax rates which will characterize city 
school practices in raising school revenue. The business agent for 
each city was asked to give the tax rate authorized by the board of 
education for raising the necessary money to meet the current ex- 
penses of maintaining the schools. They were also asked to give the 
additional rate necessary to provide sinking funds, to meet maturing 
school bonds, and to construct new buildings. Comparatively a 
small proportion of cities could separate the total school tax rate 
into these two parts. Consequently, the studies of tax rates made 
in this report are based upon the total tax rates reported.
-P-A-G-E-328
  
  328 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Business agents were also asked to report the assessed valuation 
of property taxable for school purposes and the per cent that the 
assessed valuation was of the estimated true property value. The 
estimates, therefore, appearing in the detailed table were usually 
supplied by the business agent‘or the secretary of the board. From 
these facts the tax rate on the estimated true property value has 
been computed for 1,330 cities reporting the necessary data. In 
Table 56 these cities have been distributed by groups according to 
the computed tax rate. The percentage distribution for all cities 
combined has been pictured graphically in figure 34. The highest 
frequency is found to be among cities having a tax rate varying 
from 5 to 6 mills on the dollar. Almost as many cities have from 4 
to 5 mills and from 6 to 7 mills. Unusually high rates prevail in 
some cities, 134 cities, or about one-tenth of them, having a rate 
exceeding 10 mills. Only 25 cities have a rate above 15 mills. 
In Table 82 an attempt has been made to localize by States the 
high and low tax rates in cities. These State rates have been com- 
puted in the following manner: First secure for each city and for all 
the cities in the State the amount of money raised by taxation on the 
assessed value of property. Next ascertain for each city and for all 
the cities in a State the aggregate estimated true property value. 
The State tax rate is then secured by dividing the total amount 
* raised by taxation by the estimated true property value. From these 
tables it is possible to tell which States have relatively low or high 
tax rates for the support of city schools. The average tax rate thus 
computed on the estimated true value of taxable property is found 
to be 5.09 mills on the dollar. In general it is found that the ratio of 
the assessed property valuation to the true property value is 75 
percent. These figures are based on the reports submitted by 1,330 
city schoolsystems. The total assessed valuation of property in these 
cities is $44,195,356,000, while the estimated true property value is 
$59,081,348,000. The school revenue derived from taxation on 
this property is $300,997,090. 
WHERE THE CITY SCHOOL DOLLAR GOES. 
The expenditures for city schools shown in Table 1 have been used 
in computing the proportion of a dollar going for each function of 
expense. These percentages are exhibited in figure 35 and are 
not essentially different from those shown for State school systems 
(figure 29) in another chapter of this report. In city school systems 
63.3 per cent of all expenditures goes for instruction purposes. 
Omitting ‘‘outlays,”’ or the amount spent for new buildings, grounds, 
and new equipment, it is found that 75 per cent of the current ex- 
penses of the average city school system goes for instruction purposes. 
These larger divisions, general control, instruction, and miscellaneous

expenses shown on the left-hand side of figure 35 are “‘broken up”’ to 
show the corresponding subdivisions on the right-hand side of the dia- 
gram. It is seen that 52.1 per cent of the toal cost goes for teachers’ 
salaries. Omitting ‘‘outlays,”’ it is found that almost 62 per cent of 
the total current expenses goes for the salaries of teachers. In asimilar 
manner the other percentages can be translated into current-expense 
proportions by dividing each of them by 84.4 ($1—$0.156). This dia- 
gram is different from the corresponding one appearing in the State 
report, since it does not include the amount paid out as interest on 
indebtedness. The inclusion of this item would reduce proportionally 
all other items represented. 
A detailed distribution of expenditures for each group of cities 
is shown in Table 1. In the first four groups of cities the costs of 
instruction have been distributed according to the type of school in 
which the expenditures were incurred and also in accordance with 
the purpose for which the expense was incurred. 
The total cost of maintaining the publie schools of the United 
States is $763,678,089, while that of city schools is $410,142,715. 
From the national school dollar the cities get 53.7 cents and the rural 
districts 46.3 cents. It is found, therefore, that 53.7 per cent of our 
school expenditures are incurred for the benefit of 41.2 per cent 
of the children. 
PER CAPITA COSTS (ALL CITIES). 
The average cost per pupil enrolled in city schools for current 
expenses and outlays is $46.06. This average does not include 
interest on indebtedness, which is properly chargeable to current 
school costs. Including the amount paid out for this purpose the 
corresponding per capita is increased to $47.76. Excluding outlays, 
but including current expenses and interest, the per capita cost 
based. on enrollment, becomes only $40.60. The three corresponding 
average costs when computed for each pupil in average daily attend- 
ance increases to $58.51, $60.67, and $51.58, respectively. 
A series of per capita costs based on current expenses, excluding 
interest on indebtedness, has been computed for each group of cities 
and for all groups combined both for 1916 and 1918 and for each 
State in Table 102. In the cities of the first group these average 
costs from 1916 to 1918 increased $5.25; in the second group, $6.42; 
in the third group, $7.13; and in the fourth group, $6.61. The cost 
in the cities of Group I increased 5 per cent; Group II, 7.5 per cent; 
Group III, 9.5 per cent; and Group IV, 9.8 per cent per year for the 
biennium. From these biennial increments it is evident that the 
increased cost of education in city schools has been most pronounced 
within the smaller cities. It should be noted, however, that the per 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSrumMs, 1917-1918, 331 
capita cost in 1916 in the cities of Group I was $51.28; in Group II, 
$41.46; in Group III, $37.68; and in Group IV, $33.90. These figures 
show that higher per capita costs prevailed in the larger cities than in 
the smaller cities two years ago. For these four groups in 1918 the aver- 
ages show similar conditions, $56.53, $47.88, $44.81, and $40.51 for 
Groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. In Group V, however, in 
1918 the corresponding per capita is slightly higher ($41.57) than in 
the next preceding group of larger cities. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
In 1918, only 518 cities having a population of 2,500 and over, 
maintained night schools. In these schools 16,579 teachers (7,721 
men and 8,858 women) were employed. It is seen from these figures 
that the number of men teaching in night schools is about equal to 
the number of women. Altogether, 7,133 teachers were employed 
in elementary night schools; 6,220 teachers, in secondary night 
schools; 2,348 teachers, in vocational night schools; and 878 teachers, 
in other schools or undistributed among the preceding types. 
In these night schools, 585,413 pupils were enrolled, including 
318,234 men and 267,179 women. It is seen herefrom that more 
men than women attend evening schools. These aggregates for night- 
school enrollment include 217,908 pupils in elementary schools, 
263,383 pupils in secondary schools, 74,094 pupils in vocational 
schools, and 30,028 pupils in other schools or unclassified as to type 
of school

group of cities. In the diagram the shaded area denotes the middle 
half of the cities. Thus for elementary night schools in the cities of 
Group I the cost on this count varies from $4.80 to $8.44 with the 
median at $6.18. In other words, half of these cities have a per capita 
cost ranging from $4.80 to $8.44. The lowest cost is $3.08 and the 
highest cost is $37.55. In each section of the diagram the median 
generally decreases with the size of the cities, i. e., the cost is generally 
less in smaller than in larger cities. In construing this figure it should 
be noted that no account has been taken of the number of night 
school sessions per week, the length of the session, or the length of 
the night school year. The wide range in night school costs suggests 
that various practices prevail in the payment of teachers, in the 
length of the school year, and in the frequency and length of the 
session. Greater variations from the medians within the ‘‘safety” 
zones are found in small rather than in large cities. This difference 
shows that night schools have become more or less standardized 
in the larger cities. 
KINDERGARTENS IN CITIES. 
  It is of special interest to ascertain the statistics of kindergartens 
in cities in so far as data are available. In the cities of the first four 
groups the statistics for the different types of schools (kindergarten, 
elementary, etc.) have been completely separated throughout the 
entire report. All the cities of Group V did not make the classifi- 
cations desired. In other words, some of these smaller cities reported 
only aggregate enrollment, teaching staff, etc., without designating 
either the existence or the magnitude of statistics for kindergartens. 
In the cities of 5,000 population and over it is found that 539 cities 
maintained kindergartens. Among the cities of Group V, only 121 
reported the maintenance of kindergartens. The statistics by States 
for all groups combined are shown in Table 69-B. Altogether, 76 
supervisors of kindergartens were reported. In these kindergartens, 
8,257 teachers are employed. The total enrollment in these schools 
is 412,239. This number includes 205,674 boys and 206,565 girls. 
It is seen from these figures that the boys and girls are about equal in 
number. These children attended kindergartens an aggregate of 
40,716,918 days during the year. The average number attending 
daily was 220,891. For each 100 enrolled in kindergarten, only 54 
attended daily. The irregularity in attendance in these schools con- 
stitutes a problem of vital concern. The average length of the school 
term in kindergartens is 184 days, but the children attended on an 
average only 99 days. They waste 85 days. The length of the term 
for each city reporting kindergartens is shown in Table 87. 
HEALTH AND RECREATION. 
Table 71 shows that 505 cities employed school physicians and 465 
cities employed school nurses. Altogether, 1,405 physicians and 
1,382 nurses were reported. From these figures it is seen that only a 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 335 
very small proportion of the cities employ physicians and nurses. 
For the promotion of health 811 cities incurred expenditures amount- 
ing to $1,639,553. Only 254 cities reported anything spent for recre- 
ation. The small disbursements for this purpose amount to only 
$337,112. It is quite evident that cities in general have not yet 
given much attention to the physical welfare of the boys and girls. 
This statement of course is not true for some cities, but for the ma- 
jority of them it is only too mild. The total amount spent on health 
and recreation in city schools is only $1,976,665, or 57 hundredths of 
1 per cent of the total current expenses for maintaining the schools. 
In other words, for each $10,000 spent on the education of city school 
children, only $57 goes for the conservation of health and physical 
vigor. If all the disbursements for the promotion of health went for 
the salaries of the school physicians, they would receive on an average 
only $1,167 per year. This low average implies that these physi- 
cians can only be employed as a general rule for a fractional part of the 
school term. The implication is still minimized when it is remem- 
bered that school nurses are paid out of this smail allotment for the 
promotion of health. 
TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS. 
For the transportation of pupils, 420 cities reported expenditures 
amounting to $880,435. These cities spend on an average $2,096 for 
transportation. The other cities reported no expenditures for this 
purpose. 
AN ANALYSIS OF CITY SCHOOL EXPENDITURES. 
Considerable demand has arisen for a method of analyzing city 
school expenditures which will show at the same time in graphic form 
just how much money is being spent for the various purposes, how 
this expense compares with the corresponding cost in other cities of 
similar size, and whether such expenditures have been properly dis- 
tributed. In this study the expenditures of 225 city school systems 
(45 cities in each of the five groups) have been analyzed. These 
cities were chosen because they made the distribution of expendi- 
tures required for this study and because they are located in all sec- 
tions of the country. For graphic presentation the number of cities 
in each group could not well be larger. Further, the cities studied 
in each group should form a norm for the group asa whole. Only the 
names of the citios have been printed in the graphs, but the State in 
which each city is located appears in corresponding tables. The 
order given in the graphs is the same as that shown in Table 59. 
THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT, 
In order to reduce the expenditures in each city to a common 
basis, it has been necessary to adopt some fair standard as a unit of 
measurement. The average daily attendance in all day schools has 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
    336 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
been chosen for this unit. The enrollment in night schools and the 
cost of instruction in night schools have therefore been excluded from 
consideration. Unusual expenditures, such as the cost of new build- 
ings, of grounds, and of new equipment, have also been excluded 
from the study. Thus, only the current expenses of maintaining the 
schools and the average daily attendance in the same schools have 
been used in establishing the practice for each group of cities. The 
length of the school term has not been considered, since little differ- 
ence on this account exists.

ACCOUNTING TERMINOLOGY. 
In Table 58 the cities have been arranged, for the sake of conven- 
ience, in alphabetical order by groups. The average daily attend- 
ance in each school system is given in column 2, and the total current 
expenses in column 3. The total current expenses include the costs 
of general control, instruction, operation of plant, maintenance, auail- 
tary agencies, and fixed charges and interest shown respectively in 
columns 4 to 9. These divisions of school expenditures are fre- 
quently referred to in this study as “functions of expense.’ The 
cost of general control includes all administration costs, such as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
  
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 341 
salaries and expenses of members of the board of education, business 
agents, and superintendents. The cost of instruction includes the 
salaries and expenses of principals, supervisors, and teachers, the 
cost of textbooks, and the cost of supplies used in instruction. Under 
operation of plant are placed the wages of janitors, firemen, and en- 
gineers; the cost of fuel, water, power, and light; and the cost of sup- 
plies used in keeping the school plant fit for occupancy. Maintenance 
costs represent expenditures for repair work and for replacing outworn 
furniture, apparatus, etc. Auziliary agencies embrace expenditures 
for libraries, health, recreation, school lunches, lecture courses, etc. 
Fixed charges and interest include contributions, rents, insurance 
costs, and the amount paid out as interest on the school debt. The 
expenditures shown in Table 58 have been assembled from the more 
detailed tables following later in the report. 
In discussing the graphs the curve representing the total cost per 
pupil is frequently referred to as the basal curve, and those repre- 
senting the various functions of expense as supplementary curves. 
AVERAGE COSTS PER PUPIL FOR EACH GROUP OF CITIES. 
The average annual expenditures per pupil in average daily at- 
tendance for each group of 45 cities is shown at the end of each 
section of Table 58. Thus, in Group I the average total cost is 
$57.83; in Group II, $52.09; in Group ITI, $49.93; in Group IV, 
$47.51; and in Group V, $44.52. From these averages it is seen 
that the unit expenditure is greatest in the larger cities and least in 
smaller cities. The unit expenditures, therefore, for maintaining a 
school system as it works out in practice is in general greater in a 
large city than in a small one. In the 45 cities of Group I the total 
cost per pupil, $57.83, is divided as follows: For general control, 
$2.30; for instruction, $43.36; for operation, $6.16; for maintenance, 
$2.38; for auxiliary agencies, $1.13; and for fixed charges, $2.50. 
In other words, 4 per cent of the expenditures go for general control, 
75 per cent for instruction, 10.6 per cent for operation, 4.1 per cent 
for maintenance, 2 per cent for auxiliary agencies, and 4.3 per cent 
for fixed charges. Similar average expenditures for each function 
of expense and similar percentages of distribution have been ascer- 
tained for each group of cities in the same table. In general, ad- 
ministrative costs increase with the decreasing size of cities, rising 
from $1.74 in Group II to $3.04 per pupil in Group V. On the other 
hand, instruction costs increase with the size of cities, rising steadily 
from $29.15 in Group V to $43.36 per pupil in Group I. The size 
of a city does not seem to exert any decided influence upon the cost of 
operating the school plant. The upkeep or maintenance expenditures 
in general are slightly higher in the larger cities. The expenditures for 
auxiliary agencies and fixed charges do not seem to be dependent 
upon the size of city. Because of the difference in administrative 
and instruction expenditures in large and small cities, it becomes 
necessary to treat the finances of each group of cities separately.

THE AVERAGE TOTAL COSTS PER PUPIL IN EACH CITY. 
The average costs just considered for each group of cities might 
lead one to infer that all cities in any given group might have about 
the same unit costs and distribute their expenditures in about the 
same proportion. To show the degree to which each city repre- 
sented varies from these averages and these percentages is the pur- 
pose of Table 59 and figures 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41. In Table 58, 
similar annual expenditures per pupil in average daily attendance 
have been computed for each of the 225 cities. Thus, in Group I 
it is seen that Seattle, Wash., spends annually $79.32 per pupil. 
Of this amount $2.49 goes for general control, $52.45 for instruc- 
tion, $8.25 for operation, $3.42 for maintenance, $4.22 for auxil- 
lary agencies, and $8.49 for fixed charges. The cities have been 
arranged in Table 59 in the decreasing order of their total cost per 
pupil per year. In Group I Seattle stands highest with a per capita 
expenditure of $79.32, and Atlanta, Ga., lowest with a per capita ” 
of $31.45, the average per capita for the group being $57.83. By 
dividing the cost in Seattle ($79.32) by the average cost, it is found 
that this city spends 1.37 times as much per pupil per year as is 
spent in the average city school system of Group I. This quotient 
may be called the “ratio to the average” (column 3). It is also a 
percentage showing that Seattle spends 37 per cent more than the 
average. It may also be considered an index number. On the other 
hand, Atlanta spends per pupil only 0.54, or 54 per cent, of the 
average expenditure. Atlanta has an index of 54. These ratios, 
or index numbers, have been plotted in each part of figure 37, result- 
ing in the continuous heavy black line drawn diagonally down across 
the grapb. 
THE MIDDLE HALF. 
For the sake of convenience in analyzing city school expenditures, 
it has become almost an established practice to divide the cities into 
four equal or nearly equal groups, according to the magnitude of the 
unit cost. Quartile points are employed to separate the upper and 
lower fourths from the middle 50 per cent of the cities. Thus, when 
the 45 cities have been arranged in the ascending order of unit costs, 
the point halfway petween the average cost in the eleventh and twelfth 
cities is called the first quartile and that halfway between. the thirty- 
fourth and the thirty-fifth cities is termed the third quartile. The 
limits of the middle half or the quartile points have been indicated 
by the arrows at the extreme right of each diagram. Thus, in Group 
I the expenditures in the first 11 cities are above the middle half 
and the expenditures in the last 11 cities are below the middle half, 
the remaining 23 cities having expenditures coming within the middle 
zone. The reasons for wide variations from the average can not
-P-A-G-E-368
368 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
be set forth in this limited study, even if they were definitely known. 
This presentation only attempts to show deviations from the general 
practice. It may be highly commendable for a city to incur high 
per capita costs or to maintain schools at low cost if proper results 
ean be secured thereby. Further, the more progressive school 
systems may incur unusual expenditures in one direction or another 
jn attempting to promote some particular educational experiment. 
General control expenditures, or the cost of auxiliary agencies, @ 
even in the best school systems, may exhibit wide deviations from 
the general practice. Such unusual expenditures in city schools, 
therefore, may not only not be derogatory but highly commendable. 
For each function of expense the middle half of the cities has been 
indicated either at the top or the bottom of each graph. Thus, in 
Group I the middle half of the cities spend for general control from 
0.57 to 1.10 times the average amount so spent by all 45 cities. 
These ‘zonal lines” have been indicated by the arrowheads at the 
top of figure (Part A). Similarly, the zonal limits for the cost of 
instruction (0.80 to 1.06) have been located at the bottom of the same 
chart. Half the cities fall within this narrow zone. In Part B 
the middle half for the operation of the school plant has been in- 
dicated at the top of the figure and the corresponding bounds for 
maintenance costs are shown at the bottom of the same diagram. 
In Part C similar quartile points have been located for auxiliary 
agencies and fixed charges at the top and bottom of the diagram, 
respectively. If the expenditures for any function extend beyond 
these zones, the unit cost for this purpose is considered high; if they 
are less than the smallest quartile, the cost is considered low, as 
judged by the practice of the middle half. 
UNIT FUNCTIONAL COSTS FOR EACH CITY. 
With the average line, the total cost curve, and the middle halves 
located, it becomes a comparatively easy matter to determine the 
function of expense in which the greatest irregularity exists. Con- 
tinuing with Group I, it is found that the average cost per pupil for 
general control is $2.30, while in Seattle this cost is $2.49 per pupil, 
or 1.08 times the average. This point is plotted on the graph to 
mark the origin of the “dash-dot” curve, representing general- 
control costs in Part A of figure 37. The expenditures of Seattle for 
general control come just within the middle zone. This curve 
“zigzags” back and forth across the “total cost” curve, but takes 
in general the same direction as the continuous black curve. Some 
wide deviations, however, are striking. Cleveland, Ohio, spends 
2.58 times as much for general control as is spent on an average by 
cities of its class. Washington, D. C., spends only 41 per cent of 
the average for general control. Portland, Oreg., and New Orleans,  
-P-A-G-E-369
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 369 
La., spend large unit amounts for general control. It should be 
remembered that the discussion, thus far, does not show whether 
the proportion spent for general control is high or low, as compared 
with the general practice—this will be shown later; it only indicates 
the magnitude of the expense per pupil for administration as com- 
pared with what the “average” city spends. From the curve for 
general control it is seen that Cleveland spends more for this purpose 
than either Portland or New Orleans. Birmingham, Ala., incurs the 
smallest expense for general control of any city in Group I. 
For instruction Seattle spends $52.45 per pupil, or 1.21 times the 
average cost of $43.36. This point forms the origin of the “dash” 
curve in Part A of figure 37 and falls just above the upper quartile 
of 1.06 shown by the right-hand arrow at the bottom of the chart. 
It will be noticed that this curve for instruction costs hugs close 
to the total cost curve for the reason that it constitutes on an average 
75 per cent of it. A greater range of deviations prevails for minor 
functions of expense such as general control, maintenance, auxiliary 
agencies, and fixed charges than for major functions, such as instruc- 
tion and operation of plant. The relative magnitude of these ranges 
is indicated at the top and bottom of each figure. The ranges for 
auxiliary agencies and fixed charges are exceedingly great. Los 
Angeles, Calif., spends the highest amount per pupil for instruction 
(1.41 times the average) of any city represented in the group. Bir- 
mingham, Ala., spends the least for this purpose. 
In a similar way it is found that Seattle spends for operation 1.34, 
for maintenance 1.44, for auxiliary agencies 3.73, and for fixed 
charges 3.40 times as much for these respective functions as is spent 
per pupil on an average in cities of its class. For every purpose it 
spends more than the average. It deviates farthest from the average 
in its expenditures for auxiliary agencies (3.73). It deviates almost 
as far (3.40) on fixed charges. Its expenditures for general control 
and instruction are only slightly above the average (1.08 and 1.21, 
respectively). Let us proceed to analyze these index numbers for 
Seattle to ascertain whether they exceed the corresponding pro- 
portions spent for these purposes by other cities of its class coming 
within the middle half. Judging from the procedure of the middle 
half, it appears that the expenditures for auxiliary agencies and 
fixed charges are relatively high and that the costs of general control 
and instruction are relatively low; but these assumptions have not 
been definitely established, since the middle half of the cities deviate 
more widely on minor functions than on major functions. The 
ratio for fixed charges, for example, might not, therefore, be higher 
than upper limit of the corresponding ratio for the middle half. 
The following paragraphs establish a scientific basis for determining 
59873°—21——24
-P-A-G-E-370
  370 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
whether the proportion spent by any city for any function of expense 
is higher or lower than the average and whether it falls within or 
without the middle half. 
PROPORTIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF EXPENDITURES. 
Of the $79.32 spent per pupil in Seattle, $2.49, or 3.14 per cent, 
went for general control. Of the $57.83 spent per pupil by the 
average city in Group I, 4 per cent went for this purpose. It is 
seen, therefore, that Seattle spends a smaller proportion of its total 
cost for general control than is ordinarily spent by cities of its class. 
For instruction Seattle spends $52.45 per pupil, while the average 
city of Group I spends only $43.36. In Seattle, 66.1 per cent of its 
school expenditures goes for instruction, while in the “average” 
city 75 per cent goes for this purpose. Seattle spends, therefore, 
a relatively small proportion of its total costs for instruction, but 
a relatively large amount for this purpose as compared with other 
cities of its class. As the two curves representing costs for general 
control and for instruction in Seattle (figure 37, Part A) fall to the 
right of the average line and to the left of the total cost curve, they 
appear to indicate that the cost is high but the proportion low, 
although they have been located without any reference to the pro- 
portional distribution of expenditures. It remains, therefore, to 
be shown that when any supplementary curve falls to the left of 
the total cost curve the proportion is low, as judged by the average 
proportion so spent by all 45 cities, and that when any such curve 
falls to the right of the total cost curve the proportion is high. In 
Table 59 the total cost ratio for Seattle has been divided into each 
succeeding ratio to the average, giving these quotients: For general 
control, 0.79; for instruction, 0.88; for operation, 0.98; for main- 
tenance, 1.05; for auxiliary agencies, 2.72; and for fixed charges, 
2.48, which have been called the “geometrical deviations from the 
total cost ratio.” These ratios represent the magnitude of the 
proportion spent by Seattle for each purpose as compared with that 
spent by the ‘‘average”’ city of its class, as shown below. Thus, it 
will be shown that Seattle spends for general control 79 per cent of 
the proportion spent by the average city of its class. 
This percentage is secured as follows: 
  
1.08 _ $2.30 _ $2. 49x $57. 83 Q) 0.79 = F357 “879.32 $2. 30x 879. 32 
$57. 83   
  
The unquestionably correct ratio (r) showing the relationship of 
the proportion spent by Seattle for general control to the proportion 
spent by the average city of Group I is:
-P-A-G-E-371
    STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 371 
$2.49 
Q)  redlt_ $79.32 _ $2.49 x$57.83 
~ 4,00 $2.30 $2.30 X$79.32 
$57.83 
Combining equations (1) and (2), it is found that r=0.79. In 
other words, the geometrical deviation of any ratio from the total 
cost ratio for any given function of expense represents the percentage 
relationship between the proportion spent for this purpose by a given 
city and average proportion so spent by all cities in the same group. 
Thus the proportion spent by Seattle for general control is only 79 
per cent of the proportion so spent by the average city of its class. 
The proof of this theorem renders unnecessary the computation of a 
series of percentages showing just what proportion of the expend- 
itures of each city goes for each function of expense. For instruc- 
tion Seattle spends 88 per cent of the average proportion, and for 
operation, 98 per cent. For the other three functions, it exceeds the 
average proportion. Whenever this ratio of geometrical deviation 
is less than 1, the proportion spent by any city for this purpose is 
necessarily less than the average proportion so spent by all cities of 
its class. Whenever the ratio is greater than 1 the proportion of 
necessity is larger than the average proportion. It has been proved, 
therefore, that the relative position of a supplementary curve and 
the basal curve for any city indicates whether the proportion spent 
for the given function is high or low. Thus Cleveland is high on the 
proportion spent for general control, low on the proportion spent for 
instruction, and high on operation, maintenance, auxiliary agencies, 
and fixed charges. If the expenditures of every city were distrib- 
uted in the same proportion as they are in the ‘‘average” city there 
would be no deviation from the total cost curve and all curves would 
coincide. The ‘‘spread” in the supplementary curves, therefore, 
denotes deviations. It should be remembered, however, that scalar 
deviations are different from percentage deviations, a deviation of 2 
from the basal curve at the point 1.2 is only half as great a percentage 
of deviation as the same scalar deviation at point 0.6. 
It will probably never happen, nor is it very desirable, that the 
supplementary curves will coincide exactly with the basal curve. 
Deviations may always be expected. The question is, How much 
deviation is practiced by the middle 23 cities? As in other measures 
of expenditures, the quartile points are here used to indicate the 
cities falling within and without the middle half. In Table 59, 
columns 10 and 11, it is found that one-fourth of the cities spend for 
instruction less than 91 per cent of the proportion spent by all cities. 
Another fourth spends more than 1.04 times the average proportion. 
Half of the cities spend from 91 to 104 per cent of the average pro-
-P-A-G-E-372
  372 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
portion. It is assumed, therefore, that the cities in Group I may 
vary from 91 to 104 per cent from the average proportion spent for 
instruction by all such cities without such costs being considered 
either high or low. In Table 58 it is shown that the average propor- 
tion spent for instruction in the cities of Group I is 75 per cent. Ap- 
plying the percentages (91 and 104) to this proportion it is found that 
a city must spend for instruction from 68.25 to 78 per cent of its 
total cost if it comes within the zonal bounds of the middle half. 
The cities which spend more than 78 per cent for instruction, i. e., 
the cities which have a geometrical deviation greater than 1.04, have 
been indicated with the letter H in figure 37. Those cities spending 
less than 68.25 per cent for instruction, i. e., those cities with a geo- 
metrical deviation less than 91, have been indicated by the letter L 
in the figure. When these facts are considered, it is found in figure 
37, Part A, that Seattle comes within the middle zone on the propor- 
tion spent for administration but stands low (L) on instruction costs. 
Cleveland stands high (H) on general control costs but low (L) on 
instruction costs. In this curve it is clearly seen that greater devia- 
tions (from 70 to 100) are permitted for overhead costs than for 
instruction costs (from 91 to 104)—the range in the former being 30 
points and in the latter only 13 points. The range variations explain 
why Seattle is marked low (L) on instruction costs and not marked at 
all on administration costs which are even less than instruction costs 
(1.08 for general control and 1.21 for instruction) when compared 
with the average amounts spent for these respective functions. 
With these explanations in mind, it is seen that Seattle spends 
for auxiliary agencies and for fixed charges more than the corre- 
sponding proportion so spent by the middle 50 per cent of the cities 
and for instruction less than the average percentage so spent by these 
23 cities. It would have been incorrect to have inferred that the 
proportion spent for general control in Seattle was its most commend- 
able expenditure simply because the index (1.08) for this purpose was 
lower than that for any other function of cost. The proportions spent 
for the other functions, operation and maintenance, come within 
middle bounds. These considerations relative to a distribution of 
expenditures do not vitiate the deductions made above, that the 
total unit cost in Seattle exceeds that of any other city represented 
and that the absolute unit cost for each function exceeds the average 
for the group on every count. Only on the cost-for administration 
does this city entail a unit. cost falling within the middle half of the 
cities. 
In Cleveland the total cost per pupil is just above the middle half. 
For administration it spends considerably more than the average 
amount; for instruction a little less; for operation, maintenance,  
-P-A-G-E-373
  
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 373 
and auxiliary agencies more than the average; and for fixed charges 
considerably more than the average. The high proportion spent for 
administration and the low proportion spent for instruction are 
outstanding, when judged by the practice of the middle half of the 
cities. This study does not attempt to say, however, that these 
distributions are unwise. If better results are secured by such 
asymmetrical distributions, the practice is not to be condemned. 
In fact, progress in school administration often evolves out of the 
extraordinary. This study attempts to point out where high or low 
expenditures are likely to be found; not to say why they exist or 
whether the expenditures are to be commended or condemned. A 
closer analysis of local conditions is necessary for sane judgments 
regarding a wise distribution of city school expenditures. It is hoped 
that the graphic presentations will stimulate interest in an analysis of: 
city school expenditures, and form a-standard with which city school 
costs can be compared. Any wide variations from the general 
practice should receive the most careful scrutiny from those charged 
with administering city school finances. Unusually low costs also 
~ should challenge analysis. 2 
THE NORM AND THE INDIVIDUAL CITY. 
It is not practicable to study and to present graphically the ex- 
penditures of all city school systems. Those chosen probably rep- 
resent the average conditions for all cities in their group. With 
these norms established, it becomes an easy matter to ascertain the 
location of any city not included in the graphic presentations. 
First, secure for the city in question data corresponding to that found 
in Table 58. Second, compute the average annual cost per pupil in 
average daily attendance for all purposes and for each function 
separately. Third, divide these average costs in the given city by 
the respective average costs for all cities shown in Table 22. The 
quotients thus obtained are used in locating the city on the proper 
graphs for its class—the quotient for the total cost determining its 
rank among the 45 cities, and the functional quotients, the respective 
points on the supplementary curves. Fourth, divide each ratio to 
the average for each function of expense by the corresponding ratio 
for the total cost for tke city in question. The quotients correspond 
to those given in the paired columns 6 and 7, 10 and 11, 14 and 15, 
18 and 19, 22 and 23, and 26 and 27 of Table 59. Fifth, mark with 
“HA” all ‘those quotients exceeding the respective third quartile 
points and with ‘‘L”’ all those quotients less than the respective 
first quartile points shown in the last line of each section of Table 59, 
In this manner any city may be superimposed on the graphs by 
inserting a new horizontal line at the proper place. Thus, with a  
-P-A-G-E-374
  374 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
minimum of work the expenditures of any city not included in the 
diagrams can be analyzed and compared with 45 other cities of the 
same class. The only questionable phase of this procedure is that 
the additional city studied does not form a part of standard by 
which it is measured as do the other cities included in the graphs. 
The standard, however, would not be materially affected by the 
addition of a single city. In fact, it may be more desirable to com- 
pare a city with a standard of which it is not a part. 
THE AVERAGE VERSUS THE MEDIAN. 
By using the arithmetical average, it has been possible to incorpo- 
rate in the same series of charts a study of the proportional distribu- 
tion of expenditures as well as a comparative analysis of absolute 
costs. Had the median been used instead to indicate the central 
tendency a study of proportion distribution could not have been in- 
cluded, since it does not possess the necessary mathematical proper- 
ties.. The middle half and the quartile points have been indicated 
in each accompanying chart. A sort of hybrid has, therefore, been 
employed—the average and the middle half. One limitation of this 
method needs clarification. Each city contributes its “(per pupil” 
weight in determining the basal arithmetical averages—the larger 
cities drawing the averages unduly near to them. The result is 
most pronounced in bunching the ratios either above or below the 
average of 1.00 as shown in columns 5 and 13 and in the paired 
columns 6 and 7, and 14 and 15 of Table 59,GroupI. This asym- 
metrical apportionment of ratios does no particular harm since the 
range of the middle half is “‘skewed”’ accordingly. By classifying 
the cities according to size this undesirable tendency is practically 
nullified in the cities of the last four groups, since no city in any one 
group is more than three times the size of another city in the same 
group. In Group I the cities vary greatly in size and some exert 
undue influence in displacing an average.

COST OF INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In Table 60 the 225 cities whose expenditures have just been 
analyzed have been rearranged in the order of the total cost of in- 
struction per pupil in average daily attendance in all day schools. 
Thus, in Group I Los Angeles ranks first with a per capita of $61.31; 
Portland, Oreg., second with a per capita of $53.62; and Seattle, 
third with a unit cost of $52.45. The corresponding average for the 
whole group is $43.86. Los Angeles spends 1.41, Portlénd 1.24, and 
Seattle 1.21 times this average. These points are plotted in figure 
42 at the beginning of the continuous heavy black curve. This curve 
shows whether a city spends a large or small amount as compared 
with the amount spent by the average city of its class, and whether 
it spends more or less than its ‘‘neighbors.” The ‘‘middle-half”’ on 
this curve has been indicated by the arrow heads at the extreme 
right of the diagrams. The highest 11 and the lowest 11 cities are 
outside of the ‘‘middle-half’’ on the total per capita cost for 
instruction. 
Corresponding per capita costs and ratios have been computed for 
elementary, for secondary, and for vocational, normal, and special 
schools. Only the ratios for elementary and secondary schools have 
been plotted in the diagrams, since some cities report no expendi- ° 
tures for schools of the latter types. An inspection of the diagrams 
shows that Los Angeles spends for elementary school instruction 1.20 
times as much per pupil as the average city, and for high school 
instruction 1.65 times as much as the average city spends. It stands 
slightly above the ‘‘middle-half” in elementary school costs, but 
decidedly above the third quartile in high school costs. Portland 
stands high in elementary school costs but low in high school costs. 
Seattle stands just above the third quartile in both counts. Jersey 
City ranks very high in secondary school costs. As different numbers 
representing the average daily attendance in the different types of 
schools have been used in securing the three series of ratios used in 
the diagram, these groups do not show whether the proportion spent 
for elementary and. for secondary schoo! instruction in the same 
cities is high or low. Since the continuous heavy black curve in- 
cludes the cost of instruction in vocational, normal, and special 
schools, it often does not occupy an intermediate position between 
those curves representing elementary and secondary school costs. 
In a similar manner the costs of elementary and secondary school 
instruction in the other groups of cities have been pictured in figures 
43, 44, 45, and 46. 
It has already been shown that the total cost of instruction per 
pupil in daily attendance increases, in general, with the population 
of the cities. It is shown in these five serial diagrams that the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
    
388 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
principle holds for both elementary and secondary school costs. The 
average unit cost of high school instruction in Group I is $92.01; in 
Group II, $65.84; in Group III, $62.09; in Group IV, $56.59; and in 
Group V, $55.06. Considerable difference prevails between these 
costs in very small and in very large cities. Elementary school costs 
for instruction in Group I average $36.98; in Group II, $31.50; in 
Group III, $29.92; in Group IV, $26.48; and in Group V, $23.54. 
In the chapter on public high schools it is shown that the relationship 
between elementary and secondary school costs for operation, main- 
tenance, auxiliary agencies, and fixed charges is about the same as 
that existing between such costs for instruction only. In other 
words, if it costs twice as much per year to provide instruction for a 
secondary as for an elementary school pupil, the total annual cost 
of high school education will also be about double that provided in 
the elementary schools. If this deduction applies to city schools as 
well as to all schools combined, the relative unit of cost of elementary 
and secondary education in city schools can be readily determined. 
Thus, in Group I the annual cost of high school education per student 
is 2.48 ($92.01 divided by. $36.98) times the cost of elementary school 
education. In Group II the corresponding ratio is 2.09; in Group III, 
2.08; in Group IV, 2.14; and in Group V, 2.34. From these percent- 
ages it is seen that high school education costs, approximately, from 
two to two and one-half times as much as elementary school’educa- 
tion. The corresponding ratio for an equal number of days school- 
ing for the whole country—urban and rural schools combined—is 
2.40, as shown in chapter on public high schools. Above it has been 
pointed out that for the cities in Group I the amount spent for in- 
struction is 75 per cent of the total current expenses. 
Applying this percentage to the average costs shown in figure 42 
($92.01 and $36.98), it is found that the total annual cost per pupil 
in high schools in the largest cities is $122.68 and in elementary 
schools is $49.31. Applying in a like manner the percentage 69.2, 
69.7, 65.9, and 65.5 to the average costs for Groups II, III, IV, and 
V shown in Table 58, the corresponding costs for Group II are esti- 
mated to be $95.14 and $45.52; for Group III, $89.08 and $42.93; for 
Group IV, $85.87 and $40.18; and for Group V, $84.06 and $35.94, 
respectively. It should be remembered that these considerations 
do not take into account any expeditures for new buildings, grounds, 
or new equipment.

  396 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
THE AVERAGE ANNUAL SALARIES OF TEACHERS. 
Owing to the fact that there was a considerable turnover in the 
teaching force in the school year 1917-18, it has been found rather 
difficult to secure a representative list of cities in each group whose 
reports permitted the computation of reliable average annual salaries 
of teachers. Other factors also operated to make this selection of 
cities still more difficult. First, frequently the report on the teaching 
staff does not correspond to that on the amount paid for teaching, 
the city superintendent usually supplying the personnel data and 
the business agent the financial items. Second, considerable con- 
fusion has arisen between these administrative officials as to who 
should be considered as principals and who as teaching principals, 
and who should be classed as supervisors and who as part-time super- 
visors or teachers. Third, in several instances the distribution of 
instruction costs between the elementary and secondary schools had 
not been consistently made, since often there is little agreement as 
to who should be considered as high school teachers and who should 
’ be considered as elementary school teachers. The junior high school 
in particular often makes this division difficult. i 
For 160 cities all the facts appear to be reliably and consistently 
reported. Ten of these cities are found in Group I, 21 in Group I, 
39 in Group III, and 45 in each one of the other two groups. The 
average salaries of men teachers and women teachers have been 
recorded in Table 61, but have not been used in the diagrams. As 
shown elsewhere in this report, only 10.4 per cent of the city school 
teachers aremen. Few of these teachers are found in the elementary 
schools. In fact the men teachers are so few in number in many 
school systems that the average salary paid them exhibits individu- 
ality rather than generality, when an attempt is made to reduce it 
to graphic form. Consequently, only the average annual salaries 
paid to all teachers (vocational, normal, and special school teachers 
included), to elementary school teachers, and to high school teachers 
have been graphed. 
In each group the cities have been ranked on the salaries paid to 
all teachers. Of the 10 cities represented in Group I, San Francisco 
pays the highest average salaries. This city, also, pays a higher 
average salary to high school and to elementary school teachers than 
do any of the other nine cities. In Group II, Sacramento comes first 
on each average represented in the diagram. In Group III, Mont- 
clair, N. J., ranks first among the cities appearing in the group. 
Prescott, Ariz., comes first in Group IV, and Freehold, N. J., ranks 
first in the fifth group. The median average salaries for all teachers 
have greater significance than the highest average in each group. 
The median for Group I is $924; for Group II, $779; for Group ITI, 
$678; for Group IV, $664; and for Group V, $664. The median salary,
-P-A-G-E-397
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1917-1918, 897 
therefore, decreases with the size of cities. While all cities can not 
hope to pay median averages, they can approach the median. The 
degree to which they succeed is best measured by the practice of the 
“middle half” of the cities. At the bottom of each diagram the 
quartile points and the medians have been located by means of curves 
‘of the same character as those representing the three averages de- 
scribed above and pictured in the charts. Light denotation lines of 
the same type have been drawn upward from the quartile points. 
Whenever any point on any curve falls between lines having the 
same legend, it comes within the ‘‘safety” zone at that point. In 
Group IV it is found that the average high school salary in Prescott 
is above the third quartile line. The corresponding average for 
Annapolis is between the two vertical ‘‘dot-dash”’ lines, indicating 
that its average comes within middle bounds. On elementary school 
salaries Annapolis stands beyond the third quartile. Thus, by means 
of these vertical denotation lines the relative position of the average 
salary paid by any city with respect to the practice of the ‘middle 
half” of the cities can be readily and reliably determined. Another 
characteristic of these groups should, also, be noted. When consid- 
erable variation exists between the average salaries paid to elemen- 
tary and high school teachers the curves representing these two aver- 
ages spread apart. In cities where the averages are about equal, 
the curves are drawn toward each other. Thus, in Group IV the 
inequality of pay to high school and to elementary school teachers 
in Montpelier is very striking, the high school teachers receiving 
about twice as much as teachers in the elementary schools. In Group 
V Eufaula exhibits the same characteristics. In Group III Bloom- 
field is conspicuous because of this inequality. In Group I the aver- 
age high school salary gravitates about $1,254 (the: median); in 
Group II, about $1,017; in Group III, about $891; in Group IV, 
about $857, and in Group V, about $817. It is seen, therefore, that 
the usual high school salary in the large cities is about $100 per 
month for about 12 months, but in the very small cities the average 
is less than $70 per month for 12 months. With such meager salaries 
cities can not hope to attract and hold capable college graduates 
when more remunerative vocations are open to them. 
The usual (median) elementary school salary in Group I is $868; in 
Group II, $726, in Group II, $631; in Group IV, $587, and in Group 
V, $580. From these medians it is seen that the ‘‘average” salary 
bears a close relationship to the size of the city, the larger cities pay- 
ing the higher averages. On a nine months’ basis, the teacher in 
city elementary schools receive from $67 to $96 per month on an 
average. For the other three months they get no pay.

CHAPTER IV. 
STATISTICS OF UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES, AND PRO- 
FESSIONAL SCHOOLS, 1917-18. 
ConTENTS,—Institutions reporting—Size of institutions—Instructors—A ttendance at higher institutions— 
Enrollment by departments—Enrollment in public and private institutions—Proportion of men and 
women—Degrees conferred—College graduates living—School and college mortality—Libraries—En-

and dentistry—Income—Per cent of income from each source—Special courses. 
This report presents the statistics of universities, colleges, and 
professional schools for the school year 1917-18. An attempt has 
been made also to secure certain comparative statistics from pre- 
ceding reports in order to measure any changes which have taken 
place in the practices of such institutions. The report, therefore, 
portrays historical tendencies and present conditions. 
In corresponding preceding reports the chapter on colleges, uni- 
versities, and technological schools did not include the statistics of 
professional schools which were not associated with or affiliated with 
the colleges and universities. In fact, the statistics of all professional 
schools were treated separately. As a result the statistics of affili- 
ated professional schools were duplicated in two chapters of the 
report. The present plan of including the statistics of independent 
professional schools with those of universities and colleges avoids this 
duplication. 
INSTITUTIONS REPORTING. 
For the year ending June, 1918, the Bureau of Education received 
reports from 672 universities, colleges, and professional schools. 
Of this number 118 were independent professional schools, including 
78 schools of theology, 12 of law, 9 of medicine, 4 of veterinary medi- 
cine, 8 of dentistry, and 7 of pharmacy. States and municipalities 
control 112 of these 672 institutions and private corporations control 
560 institutions. Of the 554 universities, colleges, and technological 
schools, 111 are under public and 443 under private control. Only 
one independent professional school is under public control, the other 
117 being controlled by private organizations.

\ SIZE OF INSTITUTIONS. 
In figure 1 the 672 universities, colleges, and professional schools 
have been distributed according to the total number of students 
enrolled in each. The distribution has been made by groups of 100. 
In the second and largest group, 144 institutions are included, i. e., 
these institutions enroll from 101 to 200 students each. Over half of 
the institutions do not enroll more than 300 students. Altogether, 
37 institutions enroll over 2,000 students. Of these, 13 enroll from 
2,001 to 3,000 students; 9, from 3,001 to 4,000 students; 7, from 
4,001 to 5,000 students; and 8, over 5,000 students. From these 
figures, therefore, it can be seen that there are many very small and 
a few very large colleges and universities.

    The effect of this inequality in the distribution of students among 
the colleges and universities is perhaps best demonstrated in figure 2. 
Here it is seen that 10 per cent of the institutions enroll 50 per cent 
of the students, and one-half of the schools enroll about 87 per cent 
of the students. The “‘bowing’’ of the curve of actual distribution 
away from the line of-equal distribution indicates the degree of ine- 
quality in the distribution of students. If the students were equally 
distributed among the colleges, universities, and professional schools, 
the curve and the diagonal line would coincide. 
INSTRUCTORS. 
In the universities, colleges, and professional schools an aggregate 
of 36,522 instructors are employed. The teaching staff consists of 
29,509 men and 7,013 women. These instructors are distributed as 
follows: Preparatory departments, 3,027; collegiate departments, 
23,318; professional departments, 10,183; and all other departments, 
1,547. Almost 60 per cent of the instructors in preparatory depart- 
ments are men. In collegiate departments almost 79 per cent of the 
instructors are men. In professional schools and departments 
almost 98 per cent of the teaching staff consist of men. Altogether, 
almost 81 per cent of all teachers in universities, colleges, and pro- 
fessional schools are men. It is seen, therefore, that the teaching 
staff in these higher educational institutions consists largely of men, 
there being about four men to one woman. These percentages are
-P-A-G-E-689

significant in view of the fact that in public high schools only 35 per 
cent of the teachers are men, and in the elementary schools only 13.4 
per cent of the teachers are men. There is a tendency, therefore, for 
women to monopolize the elementary and secondary school work, 
and for men to control the work in the higher institutions. 
This tendency in these higher institutions is becoming more pro- 
nounced from year to year, as shown in figure 3. A comparison of

he two curves, for men and women instructors, reveals the fact that 
general the percentage of men instructors in colleges and univer- 
ities has been steadily increasing since 1892, while the proportion. of 
omen. teachers has decreased correspondingly. It is also evident 
hat war conditions did not materially affect the teaching staff in 
hese higher institutions, since the proportion of men decreased only 
ery slightly in 1918. It is apparent, therefore, that women are not 
ery generally employed in the higher institutions. About one-half 
many women as men receive graduate degrees from our colleges

and universities, but only about one-fourth as many teach in these 
higher institutions. On the other hand, about eight times as many 
men as women receive the Ph. D. degree conferred on examination, 
yet only four times as many become teachers in these higher institu- 
tions. It should be remembered, however, in this connection that 
more men than women attend universities and colleges. PER CEHT.

ATTENDANCE AT HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
While the total collegiate and graduate attendance at universities, 
colleges, and professional schools has increased from 65,800 in 1890 
to 375,359 in 1918, or over 470 per cent, the rate of increase is not 
significant unless comparisons be made with other concomitant rates| 
of increase. For example, has college enrollment kept pace with the 
increase in public-school enrollment or with the increase in the total 
population? To answer this question figure 3 has been prepared,

been reduced to index numbers. The public high-school enrollment

Fic. 4.—Index numbers showing the comparative rates of increase in the total population, the totalhigh

universities, colleges, and technological schools from 1890 to 1918. The curve for college students has 
been shifted to the left to compensate for lag. 
ponding enrollment in 1890. Thus in 1918 the high-school enroll- 
ent was 810 per cent of what it was in 1890, or it increased 710 
er cent. The index for 1918 is, therefore, 810. The index numbers
-P-A-G-E-692
  
692 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
for the total population have been secured in a similar manner, the 
index for 1890 being 100 and that for 1918 being 168, representing 
an increase of 68 per cent within this period. As high-school students 
do not enter college, presumably, for four years after they enter high 
school, the curve for college enrollment has been displaced by this 
interval to compensate for dag. To interpret the curves, consider for 
instance the interval 1898 to 1900. The slopes of the three curves 
in this section of the graph are different, the high-school curve 
showing the steepest slope and, therefore, the greatest rate of in- 
crease; the “population” curve having the least inclined slope and 
therefore, the smallest rate of increase, while the ‘‘college’’ curve 
occupies an intermediate slope. The relative positions of the curves 
one above the other do not indicate rates of advancement; only the 
corresponding slopes of similar sections of the curves show this 
tendency to increase. 
Thus, it is seen that the high-school enrollment has increased more 
rapidly than enrollment in colleges and universities, while the enroll- 
ment in college has more than kept pace with the increase in popula- 
tion. It is evident, therefore, that colleges and universities have 
not succeeded in more recent years in drawing as large a proportion 
of high-school] students (or graduates) as they formerly did. The 
multiplication of high schools in the attempt to give every boy and 
girl the advantages of a high-school education has not resulted in as 
large a proportion of subsequent enrollment in collegiate and graduate 
courses. The vocational or trade courses now offered by some of 
the larger high schools may partly account for the decreasing pro- 
portion of high-school students entering college. One who has com- 
pleted a commercial course in high school is not so likely to enter 
college after graduation as a student who has taken the purely aca- 
demic or college preparatory. course. As the high schools become 
more and more vocationalized the proportion of graduates going to 
college may be expected to decrease. While the index curves do 
not measure precisely the decreasing proportion of high-school grad- 
uates going to college, they do indicate that this tendency unmis- 
takably exists. . 
A clearer conception as to attendance at colleges and universities 
may be gained by comparing the enrollment with the corresponding 
population which might be in college if all attended. Figure 5 shows 
such comparisons for biennial periods from 1890 to 1918. Itis assumed| 
that it takes four years to complete a college course, and that the mos 
usual ages when young men and women attend college are from 19} 
to 23. Some, of course, will attend earlier and others later in lif 
than at this time, but the age group chosen can not be far from th: 
average. At any rate the total population for any other similar ag 
group would be about the same as the total population 19 to 23 yea:

of age. The total enrollment in all departments of universities, 
colleges, and professional schools has been compared with this age 
group. The continuous curve in figure 5 varies from 3.3 per cent 
in 1898, when the smallest percentage of the population attended 
college, to 4.8 per cent in 1916, when the largest percentage attended. 
The drop in attendance in 1918 was caused by the war. The general 
direction of this curve shows in no unmistakable way that the Nation

is becoming better educated from year to year. Further proof of 
this fact is given in the second or dotted curve in this diagram which 
shows the percentage of the population 23 years of age receiving 
baccalaureate or first degrees for each biennial date. The number 
of first degrees includes first degrees granted by professional schools 
as well as baccalaureate degrees granted by universities, colleges, 
and technological schools. In 1890 less than 1.3 per cent of the 
population 23 years of age was graduating from college. In 1916
-P-A-G-E-694
    694 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
almost 2.2 per cent of the population of this age received first degrees. 
Within this period of 26 years the proportion of college graduates 
almost doubled. The drop in 1918 was undoubtedly due to war 
conditions. This curve is decidedly consistent with figure 11, which 
shows that 231 persons out of each 1,000 entering the first grade will 
later graduate from college.

ENROLLMENT BY DEPARTMENTS. 
Within the last 28 years considerable change has taken place in 
the distribution of students among the various departments. This 
change has been wrought very largely by the multiplication of sec- 
ondary schools throughout the country, thereby causing a diminution 
in the amount of preparatory or secondary school work required of 
the colleges. As shown in figure 6, the proportion of preparatory 
students has decreased from about 33 per cent in 1890 to a little less
-P-A-G-E-695
  
UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES, PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 695 
than 12 per cent in 1918. In other words, the proportion of prepara- 
tory students is now only about one-third of what it was 28 years 
ago. This decrease is compensated for by an increase in the per- 
centage of collegiate students. In 1890 about 42 per cent of the total 
enrollment consisted of collegiate students, while in 1918 the corre- 
sponding proportion was about 64 per cent, or an increase of over 50 
per cent. No marked change has taken place in the proportion of 
students in professional departments, in 1900 the proportion being 
highest and in 1916 lowest. The upward tendency in 1918 is due to 
the inclusion of students in independent professional schools not 
represented in the diagram for the preceding years. The increasing 
rigidity of entrance requirement to professional departments has 
probably caused the slight decrease in the proportion of students 
registered in such departments since 1900. 
The lower curve in the diagram representing graduate students is 
significant. The proportion of graduate students in colleges and 
universities increased from 1.5 per cent in 1890 to 4.3 per cent in 1916, 
or almost threefold. It is clearly evident that colleges and universi- 
ties are devoting an increasing amount of time to graduate work from 
year to year. This figure does not represent special students or 
students registered in other departments. 
ENROLLMENT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, 
The relative advancement of public and private universities, col- 
leges, and technological schools is clearly exhibited in figure 7. This 
diagram represents the number of students enrolled in collegiate and 
graduate departments only. To secure the index numbers for each 
curve the enrollment for each biennium has been divided by the cor- 
responding enrollment for 1896. The curve representing public 
institutions has risen more rapidly at every interval than that repre- 
senting private institutions. In other words the enrollment in 
private institutions has increased 113 per cent in 20 years, while 
_that in public institutions has increased 309 per cent. The rate of 
increase for the public institutions has been almost three times that 
for private institutions. It should be carefully noted that this 
diagram represents only the rates of increasing enrollments and not 
the actual enrollment in public and private institutions. By refer- 
ence to Table 1 it is seen that in 1916 the private institutions enrolled 
152,274 students, while those under public control registered only 
107,237 students in collegiate and graduate departments. From 
these figures it is seen, therefore, that the private institutions register 
about 42 per cent more students than the public institutions. From 
the diagram it is found that the public institutions are ‘“ growing” 
almost three times as rapidly as the private colleges and universities.

Table 1 shows the number of men and women students in universi-

been an increase since 1890. In collegiate and graduate departments 
the number of men increased from 44,926 in 1890 to 164,075 in 1916, 
while the number of women students increased from 20,874 to 95,436

265 per cent and the women 357 per cent. Considering all students 
in all departments, the men have increased only 143 per cent and the 
women only 156 per cent within this period of 26 years. In both 
computations the women have increased more rapidly than the men. 
This change in the personnel of the student body is best exhibited in 
figure 8. The two curves representing collegiate and resident grad- 
uate students possess remarkable regularity, approaching each other 
with almost mathematical precision. In 1890, of these college 
students 68.3 per cent were men and only 31.7 per cent women, but 
in 1916 only 63.2 per cent were men and 36. 8 per cent were women.

The abrupt changes evident in 1918 are due to war conditions and 
can not be taken to indicate general tendencies. When all students 
in all departments are considered, there has been little change in the 
proportion of men and women from 1890 to 1916. The general tend- 
ency taken by the curve representing purely collegiate and graduate 
students seems to predict a time when as many women as men will 
attend college. This prediction is also supported by the fact that

DEGREES CONFERRED. 
Tables 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 show the number and kinds of 
degrees conferred in 1918 by the 672 institutions. There were 
28,052 baccalaureate, 3,480 graduate, and 736 honorary degrees con- 
ferred. The degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred on exami- 
nation by 46 institutions on 499 men and 63 women, as shown in

In Table 1 the number of degrees conferred by universities, colleges, 
and technological schools is shown for biennial periods since 1890. 
The total number of first degrees, professional and collegiate, conferred 
since 1870 is exhibited in Table 6. From 1890 to 1916 the number 
of baccalaureate degrees conferred by nonprofessional departments 
increased from 7,319 to 31,826, or 335 per cent. During this inter- 
val the population increased only 63 per cent. The rate of increase 
in the number of first-degree college graduates has been over 5 times 
as great as that for the total population during this interval of 26 
years.

*Includes 651,751 collegiate first degrees and 406,776 degrees conferred by professional schools on those 
who had not préviously received collegiate degrees. 
Some conception of this rate of increase in the number of graduates 
may be gained from figure 9. These curves are index curves showing 
the comparative rates of increase in the total number of graduates 
receiving first degrees, both collegiate and professional, and in the 
total population. The original data upon which these curves depend 
are given in Table 5. The average number of first degrees conferred 
annually from 1870 to 1874, inclusive, was 9,889; in the interval 
1875-1879, 9,862; in 1880-1884, 11,645; in 1885-1889, 12,623; in

eral trends. The population curve is almost a straight line. The col-

1885-1889 the slope of the graduate curve is not as steep as that for 
the population, indicating thatthe population during this period 
increased more rapidly than the number of students receiving first 
degrees from colleges and universities. Since the latter period the 
number of college graduates has increased much more rapidly than 
the total population. This fact unmistakably indicates that the 2 3° s y 3 & s a

Nation is becoming better educated from year to year as measured 
by the number of graduates receiving first degrees from college. 
It is of interest to compare the proportion of men and women 
receiving degrees from universities and colleges. (Practically all 
degrees granted by professional schools are conferred on men, and 
so have not been included in this diagram.) In figure 10 it will be 
noted that in general the proportion of men receiving both first 
degrees and advanced dégrees has decreased since 1894. Conversely, 
the proportion of women graduates has increased. These facts show
-P-A-G-E-702
  702 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
that the rate of increase in college graduation is more favorable to 
the women. It should be carefully-noted in this connection that the 
number of men receiving first degrees has been about double the 
number of women receiving baccalaureate degrees, while the number 
of men receiving advanced degrees has been about four times as 
great as the number of women receiving such degrees. The effect 
of the war in reducing the percentage of men receiving degrees in 
1918 is clearly in evidence, the curves for men falling abruptly in 
1918 and those representing women graduates rising with an equal 
angle of inflection. 
COLLEGE GRADUATES LIVING. 
In Table 5 an attempt has been made to secure an approximate 
statement concerning the number of college graduates in the United 
States in 1918. This information is not collected decennially by the 
Bureau of the Census, nor has any attempt been made to enumerate 
the “brains” of the Nation. From the statistical reports of the 
Commissioner of Education the number of graduates receiving their 
first degrees from universities, colleges, technological schools, and 
professional schools has been ascertained for each year since 1870. 
In several instances it has been necessary to resort to estimates, which 
are held to be substantially correct. Only those graduates from 
professional schools have been included who had not already 
received a previous degree. It is believed, therefore, that the figures 
contain no duplicates. No attempt has been made to antedate 1870 
in securing the number of college graduates, as all persons graduating 
before that date are probably over 70 years of age, and very many of 
them are not now on active duty. Further, as only 41 per cent of the 
graduating class in 1870 are estimated to be living in 1918, still 
smaller percentages of those graduating earlier than that date will 
now be living. Another consideration operating to cancel these 
omissions is that many college curricula offered in years preceding 
1870 do not compare favorably with the diversified and thorough 
curricula offered to-day. It is believed, therefore, that for all 
practical purposes the table presents reliable statistics on the number 
of college graduates living in 1918. The total number of students 
graduating from college from 1870 to 1918, inclusive, is 1,058,527. 
Of this number, 908,469 are estimated to be living in 1918. In other 
words, almost 86 per cent of those graduating within this period of 
49 years are still living. This percentage does not take into account 
the number of these graduates who have become incapacitated for 
active duty. ie 
The estimated total population in 1918 is 105,253,300. There is, 
therefore, one college graduate living to-day for every 116 persons 
in the total population. If only the population 23 years of age and

over is considered, the ratio becomes 1 college graduate to every 61 
adults. 
The death rates applied in securing the number of survivors have 
been taken from the United States life tables prepared by James W. 
Glover in 1910 for the Bureau of the Census. As college graduates 
should be better able than average citizens to guard and conserve 
their health and, therefore, to promote longevity, it is probable that 
the number of survivors is slightly too low. At present there is no 
known method of compensating for this minor error. 
In computing the number of survivors it has been assumed that 
each class graduated at the age of 23. In the earlier years the usual 
age of graduation was a little over 23 years and in the later years a 
little under this age. Some, of course, graduate earlier; others later. 
These factors are practically compensating, if the average or median 
age of graduation has been chosen correctly.

2These Bercenbeees are based on the returns from 313 colleges of liberal arts which reported their enroll- 
ment by classes for the autumns 0f 1916 and 1917 (see Higher Education Circular No. 9, April, 1918, Bureau 
of Education). Itis assumed that the percentages for 1916 held for 1915 and that those for 1917 hold for 
1918. Thereductionin the percentage ofstudents enrolled in the first and fourth year of college between 
1916 and 1917 was undoubtedly due to the war. 
3In the report On State schoolsystems a series of survival percentages for elementary and secondary 
schoolsis shown. Ifthe factor ofretardation is omitted from consideration these percentages become: 
First grade, 1,000; second grade, no data ; third grade, no data; fourth grade, no data; fifth grade, 1,000;sixth grade, 830; seventh grade, 710; eighth grade, 634; first year high school, 342; second year high school, 246; third year high school, 181; fourth year high school, 150; and high school graduates (four-year schools), 
139. In the accompanying ‘text it is shown that 51.7 per cent of those graduating from a four-year high school enter college, or 72 out of the original 1,000. 
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE MORTALITY. 
For public high schools it is estimated that 93.7 per cent of all 
graduates have completed a four-year course, while for private 
high schools it is estimated that the corresponding percentage is 
only 89.2. It is also found that 28.6 per cent of those graduating 
from a four-year public high school go to college, while 40.1 of the 
graduates from four-year private high schools go to college the 
year following graduation. In 1914 160,606 students graduated
-P-A-G-E-705
UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES, PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 705 
from public and 20,303 students from private high schools. Apply- 
ing the percentages given above (93.7 and 89.2) to these totals, re- 
spectively, it is found that 150,488 students completed a four-year 
public high-school course and 18,110 students a four-year private 
high-school course in 1914, making a total of 168,598 students who 
were undoubtedly eligible to enter college in the fall of 1914. From 
public high-school statistics it is found that 28.6 per cent of the 
graduates of four-year schools will attend college the year following 
graduation. For private high schools the corresponding percentage 
is 40:1. Applying these percentages to the number of graduates 
given above, it is found that the public high schools send to college 
immediately 43,040 students, while the private high schools send 
an additional 7,262 students, making a total of 50,302 students. 
Theoretically at any rate high-school principals think that this 
number went to college immediately after graduation from high 
school in 1914. 
The college returns show that the freshman class: in collegiate 
work contained 87,088 students in 1914-15, which is 36,786, or 73 
per cent, more than the high schools knew they had sent. This 
great discrepancy is probably due to two reasons: First, the high- 
school. principal may not always know how many graduates go to 
college, as students may move from the community after graduation 
or a new principal may not be able to supply the data desired; 
second, students may not enter college immediately upon gradua- 
tion from high school but at some later date. It is definitely known, 
however, that out of the 168,598 high-school graduates in 1914 an 
equivalent of 87,088 students were enrolled in the freshman classes 
at college the following fall. Some of these, of course, are repeating 
a part of the first-year collegiate work, but such students are rela- 
tively few in number and, therefore, are not deserving of considera- 
tion in this study. It is seen therefore that about 51.7 per cent of 
the graduates from four-year high schools go to college at some time. 
This percentage is highly significant in that it forms a connecting 
link between the elementary and high school survival percentages 
on the one hand and those for colleges and universities on the other. 
In a footnote to Table 6 it is shown that 139 pupils will graduate 
from a four-year high school for each 1,000 that entered the first 
grade 12 years earlier. This transitional percentage (15.7 per cent) 
shows that 72 out of these 139 high-school graduates will go to col- 
lege. Table 6 shows that 52 of these will become sophomores; 39, 
juniors; 30, seniors; and 23 will graduate. Thus it is seen that only 
13.9 per cent of those entering the first grade will graduate from a 
four-year high school, and only 2.3 per cent of the original number 
will complete a college course.

    Similar percentages have been ascertained for the number of sur- 
vivals out of each 1,000 entering high school. On this basis it is 
found that 406 will graduate from high school, 210 will enter college, 
and 68 will complete a college course. Similarly it is found that for 
each 1,000 entering college 416 will become seniors and 322 will 
graduate. Since a large percentage of seniors in college left in 1918 
to answer war demands, it is highly probable that under normal 
conditions a much larger percentage of seniors graduate than is here 
indicated, viz, only 77.4 per cent. This graph is especially significant 
since it shows the retentive power of our school system through the 
elementary, secondary, and higher grades.- It should also be remem- 
bered that these college and university survival percentages do not 
represent special students or students enrolled in professional depart- 
ments. Had it been possible to classify these students by years the 
survival percentages would have been considerably higher. All gradu- 
ate students, in either graduate or professional departments, should not 
be included in this diagram, as they have previously passed beyond the 
limit represented in the graph. A decided drop occurs for the country 
as a whole between the eighth grade and first-year high school. As 
shown in the chapter on city school systems, this drop is not so pro- 
nounced in cities, where each child completing the elementary school 
work has an opportunity to attend high school. The loss between 
high school and college is also very pronounced, as best shown by the 
tops of the double-hatched bars in the diagram. Almost 30 per cent of 
the students enrolled in the first year of college do not enter the second 
year. The losses depicted from grade to grade in this diagram are 
sufficient to give concern to school administrators in all types of 
schools. There seems to be no measurable loss between the first] 
grade and the fifth. Compulsory attendance laws are undoubtedly, 
largely responsible for this condition. 
LIBRARIES. 
It is of interest to note the increasing size of college and university, 
libraries, as outlined in figure 12. In 1890 the average size of th 
library was a little less than 7,000 volumes per institution. In 1918} 
the average number of volumes in the library had increased to almos 
42,000. Within this period the increase was fivefold. 
The average size of libraries is not so significant, however, as 
distribution of institutions according to library facilities. This dis 
tribution is exhibited in figure 13. It will be observed that 25 
institutions do not have so many as 10,000 volumes in their libraries. 
More than one-third of the libraries fall in this group. In the secon 
group it is found that 142 libraries have from 10,000 to 19,999 vol 
umes. By adding these two groups it is found that 400 libraries d 
not have so many as 20,000 volumes. Altogether, 517 college an
-P-A-G-E-707
UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES, PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 707 
university libraries, or almost 77 per cent of the total number of 
institutions, have smaller libraries than the average previously shown, 
viz, 41,563. This asymmetrical distribution is caused by the fact 
that a few institutions have exceptionally large libraries. Thus 15 
institutions have libraries with 210,000 volumes or over as follows: 
223,470; 250,000; 253,000; 289,110; 298,856; 376,353; 410,573; 
410,722; 451,000; 545,890; 557,931; 711,416; 1,100,000; and

can. be ascertained from the detailed tables. The largest library has 
about as many volumes as the 258 institutions having the smallest 
libraries. The total number of volumes in all libraries in 1918 was 
23,025,736. 
ENDOWMENT. 
A distribution of universities, colleges, and professional schools 
according to the total value of endowment funds is shown in figure 14. 
From this diagram it is seen that 214 institutions did not report the

other end of the figure it will be observed that 90 institutions have 
endowment funds exceeding $1,000,000. In Table 1 the total value

1890 this average was only $490 per student, while in 1918 it had 
increased to $1,282 per student. The increase per student has been 
only 162 per cent, or a little over 24 times as much per capita as it 
was in 1890. It is doubtful if this per capita increase in endowment

a college education. This statement is further supported by the fact 
presented in figure 18 where it is shown that t he percentage of income 
derived from this source has decreased almost steadily within the 
ast 28 years.

VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY. 
The total value of all property owned by universities, colleges, and 
professional schools is shown for biennial dates in Table 1. These 
totals lack significance unless per capitas or average values are 
secured. Figure 16 shows the average value of all property per 
student (total enrollment) and the corresponding average per insti- 
tution. In 1890 the average value of property per student was only 
$542, while in 1918 it had increased to $1,396. (The last average is 
unusually high, since the war reduced the student body slightly.) 
The increase per student has been, therefore, 158 per cent within 
this period. In other phraseology, the average value of property 
per student is now over two and one-half times what it was 28 years 
ago. The average value of property per institution increased from 
 
-P-A-G-E-712
  712 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
$129,183 in 1890 to $945,530 in 1918. The increase in the impor- 
tance of an institution as measured by property values has been 632 
per cent within the last 28 years. The average college or university 
of to-day has property valued at about $1,000,000, exclusive of pro- 
ductive endowment funds.

PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
As shown in Table 15, in schools of theology, 8,574 men and 780 
women were enrolled; 10,998 men and 822 women in schools of law; 
13,160 men and 643 women in schools of medicine; 1,250 men, in 
veterinary medicine, 8,185 men and 129 women in schools of den- 
tistry, and 3,597 men and 456 women in schools of pharmacy. These
-P-A-G-E-713
UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES, PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 718 
‘ totals include all students in professional departments of colleges — 
and universities and in independent professional schools. In 1916 
the schools of theology enrolled 11,291 men and 760 women; schools 
of law, 22,306 men and 687 women; schools of medicine, 14,105 men 
and 662 women; schools of veterinary medicine, 3,064 men; schools 
of dentistry, 10,521 men and 194 women; and schools of pharmacy, 
5,688 men and 346 women. Within this period of two years the num- 
ber of students in schools of theology decreased by 2,797; in law 
schools, by 15,173; in medical schools, by 965; in schools of veterinary 
medicine, by 1,814; in schools of dentistry, by 2,041; and in schools 
of pharmacy, by 1,981. These enormous decreases were undoubtedly 
due to war conditions. The medical schools were least affected of 
any of the professional schools during this period. An order of the 
War Department permitted medical and dental students to complete 
their course and exempted them temporarily from the operation of 
the draft laws. 
As shown in Table 21, schools of theology conferred 816 degrees 
on men and 12 on women; schools of law, 2,272 degrees on men and 
97 on women; schools of medicine, 2,339 degrees on men and 84 on 
women; schools of veterinary medicine, 475 degrees on men; schools 
of dentistry, 2,601 degrees on men and 33 on women; and schools of 
pharmacy, 1,037 degrees on men and 13 on women. The number of 
degrees conferred by these professional schools is considerably less 
than the number conferred in 1916, as shown below, except in den- 
tistry; in theology, 2,090; in law, 4,323; in medicine, 3,436; in 
veterinary medicine, 759; and in pharmacy, 1,796. In dentistry the 
number of degrees conferred in 1918 was greater than the number 
conferred in 1916, which was only 1,852. The total number of de- 
grees conferred by these professional schools in 1916 was 14,256, 
while the corresponding number conferred in 1918 was only 9,863, 
or a decrease of almost 31 per cent. 
TUITION FEES IN LAW, MEDICINE, AND DENTISTRY. 
The annual tuition rates charged in schools of law, medicine, and 
dentistry are exhibited in figure 17. The most usual fee charged in 
schools of law is in the $100 group; while the most frequent ones 
charged for medical courses and courses in dentistry fall in the $150 
group. One school charges $200 for a law course, a school of medi- 
cine charges $250, and a school of dentistry charges $210. The tui- 
tion fees charged in schools of law and schools of medicine are scat-— 
tered over a wide range, while greater uniformity prevails among 
schools offering courses in dentistry.

INCOME. 
The total receipts of universities, colleges, and professional schools 
in 1918 was $153,801,555, including additions to endowments. The 
total “working” income, excluding additions to endowment, was 
$137,055,415. In 1892 the total income amounted to $27,894,163, 
while the “working” income aggregated $21,209,578. From these 
corresponding amounts it is found that the total income of colleges, 
universities, and professional schools increased 453 per cent within

as the per capitas exhibited in figure 15. In that diagram it is 
found that the average working income per student in 1892 was only} 
$68, while in 1918 it had increased to $365. This increase amounts| 
to 437 per cent. In other words, it now costs over five times 
much per year to provide education for a college student as it did 2 
years ago. The rate of increase has been quite regular within thi 
period and does not show any sudden increases except in 1918, whic 
 
-P-A-G-E-717

is undoubtedly accounted for. by an unexpected decrease in the 
student body due to war conditions. The statistics for income in 
1890 seem to be unreliable, since all sources of income were not 
sought at that time in the statistical inquiry. 
The average income per student indicates only a general trend, as 
all institutions do not have these averages. A clearer conception as 
to this variation among the different institutions is gained from figure 
18. Here the universities, colleges, and professional schools have 
been distributed according to the average income per student. Only 
12 institutions receive less than $50 per student; 66 receive from $50 
to $99; 82 receive from $100 to $149, etc. More institutions fall in 
this $100-$149 group than in any other. The four longest bars, rep- 
resenting 297 institutions, show an average income per student rang- 
ing from $50 to $249. The average income of $365 is not typical of 
a very large number of schools. A few schools, 29 in number, have 
a “working” income of $1,000 or more for each student enrolled. 
PER CENT OF INCOME FROM EACH SOURCE. 
A careful analysis of figure 19 shows that considerable change has 
taken place since 1892 in the percentage of revenue of universities, 
colleges, and professional schools derived from the various sources. 
The percentage derived from student fees has remained practically 
constant, beginning and ending near the 25 per cent line. The pro- 
portion derived from productive funds has decreased from 18.5 per 
cent in 1892 to 14.6 per cent in 1918, The percentage derived from 
the State and city was lowest in 1896, when the percentage was only 
10.6, and highest in 1918, when 27.2 per cent was derived from these 
sources. The percentage derived from private benefactions has 
shown considerable fluctuation, but in general has decreased within 
the period represented. While the amount of Federal aid to uni- 
versities and colleges has increased in general, the proportion of 
revenue derived from this source has almost steadily decreased in 
comparison with the amount derived from other sources. The pro- 
portion received from incidental sources has remained practically 
constant. In general these higher institutions are coming more and 
more to depend upon the State or city for support and less on income 
from productive funds, private benefactions, and Federal support.

The public institutions as a general rule derive a very small pro- 
portion of their revenue from productive funds. Almost a negligible 
percentage is secured from private benefactions. The great bulk of 
the income of these institutions comes from public sources, and from 
student fees and other sources. Alabama, Idaho, and North Dakota 
are conspicuous because of the unusually high percentages of revenue 
derived from productive funds. Delaware and Florida derive com- 
paratively high proportions of their income from private sources, 
The District of Columbia, Mississippi, Vermont, and Virginia get 
relatively small percentages of income from public sources. The 
public institutions in Arkansas, Maryland, and New York derive 
practically all their income from public sources. 
The private institutions, except in Vermont, get very little revenue 
from public sources. The greatest proportion of revenue comes from 
student fees and other sources. A considerable proportion also 
comes from productive funds and private sources. Connecticut, 
Idaho, and Illinois are conspicuous for the large proportion of income 
derived from private sources. The private institutions in California, 
Connecticut, Florida, Hlinois, Louisiana, Maine, and Texas receive 
relatively large percentages of revenue from productive funds. In 
Alabama, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Maryland, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia 
over 70 per cent of the income of these private schools is derived 
from student fees and other incidental sources. ,     
            
       
       SPECIAL COURSES. 
Table 17 shows the number of students enrolled in the various 
special courses offered by universities, colleges, and professional 
schools. In short winter courses 12,096 students were enrolled, con- 
sisting of 8,429 men and 3,667 women. In extension courses 15,063 
men and 17,817 women were registered, making a total of 32,880 stu- 
Jents. In correspondence courses there were 2,879 men and 2,459 
‘omen, or a total of 5,338 students. 
In the summer schools of these higher institutions in 1917 25,538 
en and 52,521 women were enrolled. The number of women was 
ore than double the number of men in these schools,

PREFACE 
Way is the course of study in use in our elementary 
schools constituted as itis? Why are reading, spelling, 
arithmetic, grammar, and history taught the children, 
rather than knitting and shooting and guiding auto- 
mobiles ? - 
What particular gift has each of the conventional 
school studies to bestow upon the children, and hence 
upon society, as justification for its place in the curric- 
ulum and as compensation for the labor, the tears, 
the time of the students, and the care, the effort, and 
the financial expenditures of the community ? z 
These are questions that should be answered by 
teachers, parents, and public officials, if the best results 
are to be obtained from the schools. -But most teachers 
take the course of study handed to them from above 
and teach it perfunctorily, without much serious con- 
sideration of its reason for being or for its motive. 
Most parents accept the courses forced upon their chil- 
dren, more or less willingly, but with the vaguest 
notions of their meaning or motive. Most school 
officials accept the conventional curriculum inherited 
from the past and used by their neighbors and pass it 
on to their own schools, taking for granted that it is 
right. 
In this book no attempt is made to trace the history 
of the curriculum. That I willingly leave to more

learned writers. But I have endeavored to give in 
plain, untechnical terms a few of the practical psycho- 
logical and sociological reasons for teaching the subjects 
found in most of our elementary school curricula, and 
to state what should result, from their study, to the 
benefit of the children and of society. 
In some cases, also, I have intimated methods that 
seem likely to aid in securing the desired results, but I 
have not attempted to discuss methods of teaching in 
detail. That has been well done by several writers al- 
ready. However, I have it in mind, in the near future, 
to offer a book discussing methods more fully than the 
limits of the present work allow, basing such discussion 
upon the specific psychological and social functions of 
the various subjects studied, as outlined in this book.

WHAT CHILDREN STUDY 
AND WHY 
CHAPTER I 
Tue Course oF Stupy AS A WHOLE 
Tr is the purpose of this book to discuss the Course of 
Study of our elementary schools, treating its different 
subjects and departments seriatim and in some detail. 
But as a preliminary to such particular discussion, it 
seems necessary to consider briefly the curriculum as a 
whole, as to its aim and general character. 
The course of study in a system of schools, whether 
of a state, a county, or a municipality, serves a two- 
fold purpose: one economic, the other educational. Its 
economic function is the unifying of the schools. It is | 
the cohesive force that makes of an aggregation of schools 
a system. The educational function of the course is to 
serve as a guide to the teachers in their work ; for, unlike 
the ordinary college curriculum, it is not made by those 
who are to use it, and hence may not be departed from 
at will. These two main functions call for special charac- 
teristics. 
I. THE ECONOMIC FUNCTION 
First, the economic function: what sort of unity is 
desirable in a school system, and how may a course of 
study promote such unity? 
rt

2 What Children Study and Why 
Naturally, if the pupils in the schools are uniformly 
and exactly graded and daily tasks are prescribed for all 
the grades, the result will be uniformity, and uniformity 
is a kind of unity. 
Is it possible to give due recognition to a desirable 
freedom for the teachers and to the varying needs of 
children coming from many kinds of homes, and at the 
same time to preserve necessary unity? 
In any one of our larger cities, with its heterogeneous 
population, with the widely differing needs of black and 
white, foreign-born and native, children of millionaire 
and of ditch digger, those from homes of luxury and 
culture, where all the influences supplement the work 
of the school, and those from the abodes of poverty, vice, 
and ignorance, who are kept in school only through the 
force of law, —is it possible under such varying con- 
ditions to frame a single course of study that will prop- 
erly regard the needs of all and do violence to none? 
Is there any wide field of knowledge, any single line of 
intellectual activities, of such universal adaptation that 
all may profitably spend time in their cultivation and 
pursuit? Even if such subjects of study can be found, 
is it well to attempt to require the same attainments in 
them of all children of all sorts? In other words, is 
it possible to frame a prescriptive course of study for 
New York or Chicago or Philadelphia, or even for a small 
city, that will not do violence to the needs, not only of 
many individuals, but of some whole classes of children, 
some entire schools? If it were possible to frame a 
course having this negative adaptation, is it desirable, 
or is it necessary to the preservation of proper unity in 
a system?
-P-A-G-E-9
The Course of Study as a Whole 3 
What Uniformity is Desirable.— What degree of 
uniformity in a school system is desirable or necessary 
to the preservation of unity? 
xz. It should be possible for every child to pass through 
all the grades of a system, from the lowest to the highest, 
without serious hindrance because of differences of sub- 
ject matter taught, or of administration. 
2. It should ‘be possible for children changing their 
residences to go from one school to another without 
loss of grade or other embarrassment arising from dif- 
ferences in instruction. The good of the individual 
children requires this degree of uniformity. 
3. It should be possible for supervising officials to judge 
of the efficiency of teachers according to some standard of 
attainment on the part of the pupils. It is not necessary, 
however, for this standard to be strictly uniform. 
4. It is desirable, but not essential, that instructions 
given to teachers and aids furnished them for their 
work be of general service. This is more important in 
smaller communities than in very large cities, in which 
division of the supervising force and differentiation of 
function among its members are possible. These needs 
seem to indicate the natural limits of necessary uniformity 
in a course of study in a school system. 
Differences in Administration Desirable. —It seems 
to me beyond question that there should be great differ- 
ences in the course as administered in different schools, 
especially in large cities. The children of the poor 
foreigner, who hear no English in the home, who them- 
selves are accustomed to speak a foreign tongue, whose 
knowledge of the English language is limited to a few 
incorrect or slang phrases picked up on the street, and
-P-A-G-E-10
4 What Children Study and Why 
whose schooling is almost sure to be limited to the mini- 
mum required by law, certainly must have instruction 
different from that needed by children who have been 
accustomed from infancy to good English only, and who 
are reasonably sure to continue in school at least to the 
end of the public school course. With the same course 
of study, the knowledge acquired by these children is 
sure to differ greatly; and the desired end of intellectual 
growth by all, as nearly equal as possible, would be 
greatly facilitated by treatment adapted to their indi- 
vidual conditions. 
Unity of Aim and Purpose. — The unity to be sought 
is one of aim and purpose, the development of each 
child into the best possible for him. Individual growth, 
rather than the knowledge of the same facts by all, is 
the end to be desired. 
A Necessary Minimum. — A minimum must be fixed, 
necessarily, and this is not difficult. There are certain 
subjects so nearly universal in their adaptation that all 
children should pursue them. The differences should be 
mainly in the details of these subjects and in the methods 
of presentation. 
The subjects a knowledge of which the experience of 
mankind has singled out as essential to such an educa- 
tion as the good citizen needs, are: Reading with its 
corollary, good literature; writing; the use of the pre- 
vailing language, with us, English; arithmetic; and 
history, especially of the student’s own country; and of 
minor, though great, importance to all, the laws and 
phenomena of nature, and various manual and industrial 
arts, such as drawing and the use of tools. These should 
be in all elementary courses of study. But it by no
-P-A-G-E-11
The Course of Study as a Whole 5 
means follows that all students should be taught all 
these subjects to the same extent, or in the same manner. 
Their presence in a course of study insures unity. Free- 
dom in their treatment, in the emphasis placed upon 
them, and in their correlations with one another, as sug- 
gested by the mental and social status of the pupils, 
gives the variety in unity which is to be desired. 
Correlation Necessary.— A proper correlation of 
subjects, allowing the placing of stress upon this phase 
or that, is one key to the problem. For example, the 
children of very many immigrant families need, for a 
time at least, to recognize the fact that all other subjects 
must be subordinated to the study of the English lan- 
guage. That does not mean, however, that no other 
subject should be studied. The same subjects may be 
pursued by them as by other children, but with a change 
of emphasis. Language cannot be taught alone. It 
is the medium for the expression of thought. Hence 
“content ” subjects must accompany the study of lan- 
guage and furnish thought for expression, else the in- 
struction in language will be barren. Such “content” 
subjects are the great fundamental interests of humanity, 
the laws and phenomena of nature, the ideals, the occupa- 
tions, and the achievements of men — that is, “ nature 
study,” history, literature, and the industries. But 
while all children should study these subjects, the em- 
phasis and the portion of time given to each should vary 
as widely as do the children themselves. 
Stress should be Varied. —In some cases the chief 
stress should be upon the “‘ content” study itself, and 
this should be chosen with reference to the needs of 
the children. To those from poor and sordid homes,
-P-A-G-E-12
6 What Children Study and Why 
literature and history, imparting ideals, should be made 
much of. To the children of well-to-do parents with 
aristocratic tendencies, human industries as exempli- 
fied in manual training exercises should be prominent 
as content studies. With other children, as indi- 
cated above, the form of expression itself should re- 
ceive the chief attention. The need of each must be 
considered. It will not do to give brimstone and treacle 
to all because it may be good for some. A mechanical 
uniformity, regardless of local or individual conditions, 
not only wastes the time and energies of pupils, but 
prevents even reasonable equality of result in spiritual 
growth and in attainment throughout the system. 
\ Course Adaptable.— A course of study, then, to secure 
unity to the system, need not be rigidly prescriptive. It 
should require that fundamental subjects be taught 
thoroughly in. all schools, but should allow details of sub- 
ject matter, the choice of material for elaboration and 
illustration and, in the main, methods of instruction, 
to be determined by local and individual needs. 
Results Required. — The absolute requirement should 
be “ results,” as shown in the knowledge and power of the 
children, and these results should be determined, not 
by any narrow tests, but by standards of growth wisely 
and personally applied. These necessarily include steady 
progress by the children in fitness for life as it comes to 
them, and the acquisition of sufficient intellectual power 
and knowledge to enable them to meet the demands of 
what comes next, whether in school or out. 
All children shoul’ acquire at least a reasonable 
minimum of knowledge of the accepted fundamentals, 
but not necessarily all the knowledge, or the same knowl-
-P-A-G-E-13
The Course of Study as a Whole 7 
edge, of those subjects that other children in the same 
or in other schools may possess, but merely that which 
is essential to progression. A pupil who cannot perform 
reasonably difficult problems in addition and multipli- 
cation is not qualified to work in interest, and if this 
power has not been acquired at the proper time, some- 
thing has been wrong, because these subjects are fun- 
damental in mathematics. But a knowledge of duo- 
decimals is not essential to work in percentage, even 
if it comes before it in the book. 
Course should be Rich in Suggestion. — In addition 
to stating in broad general terms the prescribed funda- 
mental subjects, with their requirements for each grade, 
the unity of the system requires that the course of study 
be rich in suggestion as to detail, as to additional material, 
and as to the development of the different subjects. 
While mandatory instruction as to details of matter and 
of method are dangerous, not only to the freedom of the 
teacher, but also to the real spiritual unity of the system 
itself, suggestions as to these matters are promotive of 
both these desirable ends. 
If the unity of the system is to be one of spirit and of 
aim, all means that tend to make clear the aim and to 
cultivate the proper spirit are helpful. The highest 
and best unity can be secured through freedom stimu- 
lated by suggestion and inspiration, never through force 
or prescription. 
2. THE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION 
The educational function of a course of study is to 
serve as a guide to the teacher in his daily work. The 
characteristics that are required for the preservation
-P-A-G-E-14
8 What Children Study and Why 
of the unity of the system are equally essential to this 
second function. There must be prescription as to funda- 
mentals, freedom as to detailsand methods. The teacher 
needs to have requirements stated positively and clearly 
so that he may be sure of his ground and may qualify his 
children for progress without check or setback. The 
general phases of the subjects tpon which his efforts are 
to be expended, and the results expected of his class, 
must be stated in unmistakable language, but in broad 
terms, the terms of unity rather than of uniformity. 
Daily Programs Harmful. — The course of study should 
not give daily programs to the teachers of the different 
grades, even approximately. While these programs 
are of much importance, they are matters of detail to 
be worked out in every school by the teacher and the 
principal, according to local conditions. For example, 
among certain classes of children in our cities the power 
to compute seems to be almost hereditary, and the desired 
results can be secured with comparatively little effort, 
while the study of the English language and of history 
and civics needs a large share of the time. In other 
quarters the reverse of this condition is found. 
Initiative to be Encouraged. — Moreover, prescription 
as to details of subject matter and of method and as to 
the daily program is injurious to the teacher and de- 
structive of good teaching. Teachers who are fit for 
their places can attend to these matters better than the 
maker of the course of study, and they should not 
merely be allowed, they should be compelled, to do so 
for their own growth. 
A cast-iron course of study is as destructive of teach- 
ers as the shoes worn by Chinese ladies are of their feet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  
The Course of Study as a Whole 9 
The school machine at its best constantly endangers the 
teacher’s power of initiative, his most valuable mental 
possession. Hence every effort should be made to reduce 
this danger to the minimum. A premium, rather than the 
threat of disapproval, should be set upon originality that 
secures results in fresh ways. I have seen scores, hun- 
dreds, of potentially good teachers robbed of interest and 
of teaching power by the rigid requirements, in minor 
matters, of the course of study. These teachers, when de- 
prived of this corselet and compelled to stand erect alone, 
to breathe freely and to act unstayed, have been dismayed 
and helpless, and have begged to be told again just what 
to do for each period of the day; and I have seen many 
forced into activity and made in the end strong, original, 
and. enthusiastic teachers through being compelled to 
do their own thinking and planning. 
Thus, for the good of the teacher, as well as for the 
unity of the system, a course of study should be rigid 
in its requirements as to results in the fundamentals, 
but should leave to the teachers its application and ad- 
ministration in particular fields. 
~ It should, however, supply a great amount ‘of material 
for choice and should suggest method, illustration, and 
correlations, all in the. spirit of the system. It should 
abound in explanation, suggestion, and inspiration — 
in all sorts of genuine helps; but they should be stimuli 
to independent effort, not predigested food to take its 
place. 
Course not too Easy to Comprehend. —A course of 
study should not be too easy of comprehension. It 
should require the teachers to study the course itself, in 
order to comprehend it, and to study outside the course 
   
-P-A-G-E-16
  IO What Children Study and Why 
for help in administering it. A course that a teacher can 
keep in his desk and follow satisfactorily by occasional 
references to it is a feeble course indeed. 
A good course necessarily rests upon science and phi- 
losophy, both psychological and sociological, and should 
continually refer the teachers to these sources for an ex- 
planation of its principles, and should require of them 
professional research and study, — for such study is the 
teacher’s vital breath. 
A course of study should also demand for its administra- 
tion a fair amount of general culture, and should make 
necessary constant excursions by the teacher into the 
_ fields of science, history, and literature, for these ex- 
cursions mean personal growth. 
Body of Knowledge and Range of Activities. — As 
education consists in growth, through nutrition and 
exercise, that is, through the acquisition of knowledge 
and through expression— receiving and producing, 
import and export — the course should make provision 
for both these processes. It should provide or suggest 
a body of knowledge and a range of activities. The former 
calls for knowledge on the part of the teacher, the latter 
for the free exercise of judgment and initiative. 
The field of prescription is mainly limited to the body 
of knowledge and indeed to the main and fundamental 
facts within it. 
The field of suggestion and inspiration is largely in 
the expressive work of the school. As expression makes 
knowledge vital, the range of activities is the vitalizing 
part of the course of study. It is not enough that a course 
state that the work in history for the fifth grade shall 
cover so many pages of such and such books, or that it
-P-A-G-E-17
The Course of Study as a Whole nn 
shall include certain named topics ; it should both suggest 
more topics than can be pursued, and should throw as 
many side lights as possible upon the subjects; should 
indicate sources of information, and should point out 
possible correlations with other branches of study; it 
should suggest methods of approach and various means 
of illustration. Especially should it show how impres- 
sions may be deepened and clarified by the employment 
of the various arts of expression, as the writing of stories 
and representation with pencil or brush and by con- 
struction. In short, it should not only indicate the 
subject matter to be taught, properly classified, but 
should also open the eyes of the teacher to all possible 
means for making the teaching effective, that, his imagi- 
nation being stimulated, he may choose or originate the 
best available instruments and methods. If, however, 
these things are prescribed, that very fact makes them 
mechanical and impairs or destroys their efficiency. 
Here is the opportunity of the superintendent, in making 
the course, to do his highest work, and for the teacher, 
while following it, to do his highest work. 
Résumé. — A course of study has two main purposes : 
to preserve the unity of the school system, and to serve 
as a guide to the individual teacher. For both these 
ends it should be mandatory and prescriptive as to 
fundamentals, but broad, free, suggestive, and stimulat- 
ing as to details and methods. 
The course should require the teacher to study, both 
for a comprehension of its principles, and for culture. 
It should be based upon a body of knowledge, and 
should indicate a range of activities. Prescription be- 
longs chiefly to the former, freedom to the latter.   
     
-P-A-G-E-18
12 What Children Study and Why 
But throughout the course, the spirit and aim must be 
manifest. If the aim is to perfect the machine, to enable 
the children to obtain “‘ promotion ”’ by passing a formal 
examination, that should be made evident at every step, 
so that the teacher may direct his efforts successfully 
and waste none on iridescent dreams. But if the 
aim is really the growth of children individually into 
knowledge, power, and civic righteousness, the course 
of study should make that truth plain at every step, 
that the teacher may be inspired by the high aim, and 
may take account of the individual status and needs of 
the children.

CHAPTER II 
READING 
I. FUNCTION OF THE READING LESSON 
The Value of Reading. — Doubtless arithmetic in its 
simpler processes satisfies a more elemental human need 
than does reading. The illiterate often can. perform 
accurately the operations upon numbers required for the 
commoner business transactions. Indeed they must do 
so if they are to enter into even the simple economic 
relations necessary to making a living. Whereas read- 
ing, though vastly useful, is not essential to such relations. 
This is further shown by the fact that not so many years” 
ago the great majority of successful men, even the very 
rich and powerful, could not read at all. But mani- 
festly they could and did compute. 
Notwithstanding this fact, it is still true that reading 
makes possible the satisfaction, certainly of higher 
human needs, and probably of a larger number, than does 
arithmetic. Consider the limitations of him who can- 
not read. How small is his field, how narrow his horizon, 
how restricted his outlook. The limits of his vision and 
the length and strength of his legs bound his world. 
He knows what his senses tell him immediately, and the 
only supplement to his knowledge derived from the actual 
contact with things comes through the spoken word, 
the uncertainties of oral recital. Without the art 
13
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 What Children Study and Why 
of recording thoughts in symbols and the twin art of 
translating the symbols again into thoughts, man has 
no past but a vague and brief shadow, and no present 
beyond the encircling horizon observed from the near-by 
hilltop. 
But teach him to read, and lo! his horizon is lost in 
infinity. All the past is his, and all the present. He may 
enter at once the glorious democracy of letters. The 
great of all ages, poets, sages, seers, may be his friends 
and associates. He may pace the academe with Plato, 
may listen to the inescapable questions of Socrates. 
The verses of Hafiz, the gentle speech of Buddha, the 
laws of Moses, the songs of Homer, of Dante, of Goethe, 
and the dramas of Shakespeare,—all are his. He 
may live over again the wanderings and sacrifice of 
Abraham, the conquests and defeats of Cyrus and of 
Cesar, of Charlemagne and of Bonaparte, of Nelson and 
of Washington, may enter into the struggles and tri- 
umphs of Galileo, of Newton, and of Humboldt, of 
Columbus, of Magellan, and of Cortez, — and all because 
he can read. 
Truly, not even gold, that magical key, can open the 
doors to so many treasure houses, so many gardens of 
delight, such a paradise of choice spirits, as this common 
art of reading, the chief of all arts; and this wonder- 
ful key is offered to every boy and every girl at the price 
of a little toil. ; 
Unfortunately, many who are given the key never use 
it to possess themselves of the treasures within their 
reach. Why is this? What can the schools do to bring 
a larger number of children into full and conscious 
possession of their noble heritage? How shall reading
-P-A-G-E-21
  
Reading 5S 
be taught so as to secure its higher as well as its lower 
ends? 
Aims of the Reading Lesson. — What are the ends to 
be aimed at in the reading lesson? They are: (1) Ability 
to get the thought conveyed by the symbols found on 
the printed page, accurately and speedily. (2) Ability 
to judge the values of what is read, a discriminating 
taste, and a genuine love for good literature. This in- 
volves a considerable knowledge by the children of 
such literature as properly falls within the field of their 
interest and comprehension. (3) Ability to read aloud 
agreeably and effectively. (4) The power to think should 
be cultivated by the process of learning to read. 
2. LEARNING TO READ 
Let us consider learning to read, what it is, and some 
- of the commoner methods of teaching the art, and also 
how to make accurate and rapid readers. 
Nature of Reading. — Reading is interpreting sym- 
bols, imaging the ideas and thinking the thoughts 
symbolized. The complexity of the symbolism em- 
ployed sometimes causes confusion in the minds of 
teachers, and is responsible for over emphasis upon the 
less important features, producing faulty methods and 
poor results. A single letter stands not for a thought 
or an idea, but for a sound, sometimes for any one of 
several different sounds, according to the relations in 
which it occurs. 
Meaning of Letters. — The written word has two dis- 
tinct phases:. it stands for a synthesis of the various 
sounds represented by the different letters and it is the 
symbol of an idea. For example, the letters 7, u, 1
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 What Children Study and Why 
represent not ideas, but different sounds, effects pro- 
duced upon the auditory nerve by waves of air, set in 
motion by certain muscular movements of the vocal 
organs. But these sounds heard in quick succession 
produce in the mind an idea or image of an action — 
running, having naturally no relation whatever to the 
sounds. 
Moreover, the sight of the letters that represent the _ 
sounds produces in the mind the same image that hear- 
ing the sounds causes. The written word run becomes 
the representative of the spoken word run, but upon 
observing the written word the trained mind forms an 
immediate image of the idea run, without, at least con- 
sciously, thinking of the spoken word through which it 
has come to symbolize the idea. So we say justly that 
the written word is the symbol of an idea, although in 
its origin it is a step removed from the idea. 
Spoken and Written Words. — This relation of the 
written symbol of an idea to the spoken word that rep- 
resents the same idea is comparatively modern. The 
spoken word necessarily preceded the written word. 
But the first graphic symbols employed had no relation 
whatever to the sounds of the spoken words that stood 
for the same ideas. The origin of the oral names of ideas 
is enveloped in mystery and told only in myth. The 
first graphic symbols were pictures, rough representa- 
tions of objects or of actions, made with chisel or impro- 
vised brush; and the earliest typical characters having 
a general significance, such as the cuneiform, were 
merely conventionalized pictures and bore no relation 
to the sound of the word as spoken. 
The earliest alphabet, on the other hand, was an at-

tempt to represent graphically the uttered sounds and 
so to bring into harmony the oral representations of 
ideas and their written symbols. 
The Alphabet.— Naturally, in order to make an 
alphabet, a list of arbitrary characters which should 
represent the sound elements of words, it was necessary 
first to analyze the spoken word into its sounds. For 
not only did the spoken word precede the written word, 
it preceded any conscious consideration of its sound 
elements. To the makers of the first alphabet the word 
existed already made and the first step was the analysis 
of its sounds. Characters were invented to represent 
these and then names were given to these characters. 
Then characters were put together in the order in which 
they were sounded in the spoken word, to make the 
written word. 
I have treated this phase of the subject so fully, not 
for the sake of elaborating upon the obvious, but, if 
possible, to throw a little light upon the various methods 
of introducing children to the greatest of the arts, ad- 
vocated, often with so much warmth, as nosirums or 
panaceas. 
Learning to Read. — Learning to read, then, is learn- 
ing to translate the symbols found upon the printed 
page into images representing ideas. To the ready 
reader the sight of the printed word gives the idea; this 
step is immediate, the spoken word not entering into 
the process. The beginner may make the step either 
directly, or with the assistance of the spoken word 
(either heard or imaged), according to the quality of his 
mind and sometimes according to the method by which 
he is taught.
-P-A-G-E-24
  18 What Children Study and Why 
The notably ear-minded child, in most cases, will prob- 
ably image the sound, and the sound heard will usually 
aid his visualization of the word; while the markedly eye- 
minded child will go more readily from the symbol to the 
idea directly, and the introduction of the sound element 
at an early stage is to him confusing rather than help- 
ful. Necessarily, stress put upon “ phonics” or upon 
“thought ” by the teacher at the outset of a child’s 
reading career will affect his method of grasping the 
thought from the symbol. 
Analysis and Synthesis. — Whatever the method of 
first initiating a child into the mysteries of reading, sooner 
or later he must master the entire process and all the 
relations. He must be able to transmute sight into 
sound; upon seeing the symbol he must in imagination 
hear the word spoken and he must be able to dissolve it 
into its sonant elements. Again, he must be able at the 
sight of letters, standing for known sonant elements, to 
unite in imagination these known elements in new rela- 
tions forming other words. That is, from an analysis 
of run he must get the sounds r-u-n as represented by 
the letters 7, u, and , and from this knowledge he must 
be able to read at sight u-r-n, urn. And always finally 
he must be able to pass at sight from the symbol to the 
idea without the mediation of the imaged sound. 
This elaborate analysis, however, need not be intro- 
duced at the beginning of a child’s learning to read. 
Indeed, its very complexity is one of the arguments 
against such early introduction. This will be more fully 
discussed later under the head of method. 
One other phase of this subject needs elucidation at 
this point.
-P-A-G-E-25
  Reading 19 
The Eye-minded and the Ear-minded. — The late 
Dr. William T. Harris, that profound educational logi- 
cian, used to say that, in learning to read, a child from 
being ear-minded becomes eye-minded. I cannot but 
think that is an extreme statement. A child before he 
learns to read is by no means solely, nor even chiefly, 
an ear-minded being. Nor is the only effect of learning 
to read an increase of eye-mindedness. The eye feeds 
the mind of a normal child from early infancy beyond 
all possible calculation. Moreover, learning to read, 
while it opens a whole new field to the mind through the 
eye, at the same time greatly enlarges the ear’s contri- 
bution to the mental content. 
The constant overlapping of the senses, the borrowing 
by one sense from another, by which all are enriched 
through common contributions, is exceedingly in- 
fluential here. The sight, while itself gaining new power, 
also stimulates and enriches the hearing. The constant 
necessary interchange by the two senses in the process 
of reading brings to each a gift from the other. 
So while Homer’s contemporaries heard Homer’s 
poems, we, reading them, by this transfer of intelligence 
enjoy a similar pleasure, because the written word carries 
us back to its source, the spoken word, and in mind we 
hear the “sounding sea” and “ the twang of the silver 
bow.” Indeed, without this subconscious influence of 
hearing upon sight, rhythm and rhyme would have no 
meaning to the silent reader. Poe’s “‘ Bells ” would be 
silly and all poetry would be absurd, except when 
read aloud. 
Dr. Harris doubtless had in mind the field of language. 
Before learning to read a child is ear-minded as to words, 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  20 What Children Study and Why 
He knows them only as he hears them. After learning 
to read he knows them also as he sees them. But his 
ear-mindedness is not thereby diminished, or should not 
be. Eye-mindedness is added to it, not substituted for 
it. And as the world’s valuable treasures of knowledge 
are locked up in books and open to the eye alone, this is 
the addition of a whole world. 
3. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TASTE 
The Thought Element in Reading. — Obviously the 
primary purpose of the reading lesson is to teach the child 
to get the thought from the printed page, and all other 
elements, as the study of sounds or the names of letters, 
that enter into the instruction are at most but acces- 
sories and aids to the single purpose of the lesson. And 
they may be ignored for the present, while we consider 
a more important element. 
Since reading is thinking the thoughts expressed by 
the symbols, even in the very earliest beginnings of 
learning the art, it stands to reason that the thought 
to be read should be worth the child’s thinking. I do 
not need to say that to think unworthy or idle thoughts 
is degrading, and that when this is done under strong 
impulse, as in learning to read, with the mind intensely 
active and working at its best, the effect is thoroughly 
bad, and the habitual attitude of mind toward the act 
of reading thus produced is unfortunate. 
Of course, school readers do not contain evil thoughts, 
but many of them do contain silly, idle thoughts of no 
value to the children. This is particularly true of many 
of the “ primers ” and “ first readers” in common use, 
and especially, and almost of necessity, of those made to
-P-A-G-E-27
Reading 21 
exploit some favorite “method.” The much-derided 
“See the ox go up” primer has given place to the 
primer of “I see an ox.” 
If every reading lesson is to be a thought lesson, every- 
thing read should of course contain worthy thought. It 
is not necessary to fill primers with history or geography 
or philosophy, but they should contain statements that 
mean something to the children and something worth 
while, — facts or fancies that belong to their world, — 
and they should contain nothing else. There is abun- 
dance of available material in the natural activities of 
children and in the delightful field of children’s lore to 
equip any primer builder. Reading books, from the 
highest to the lowest, should satisfy the two main desires 
behind all voluntary reading, getting information and 
finding enjoyment and inspiration. The latter is really 
of more importance than the former. The habit of 
reading for information is much more likely to be stim- 
ulated out of school than that of reading for pleasure, 
especially elevated and elevating pleasure. Children 
should come to look upon a book as a treasure house, to 
be approached with glad anticipation. This mental 
attitude can be cultivated only by presenting books that 
both gratify and develop literary taste. 
The school reading book gives to the majority of 
children their only introduction to genuine literature. 
Literary taste, ability to enjoy the best in this treasure 
house, if not cultivated through the reading lesson, will 
never be cultivated. Hence it is little less than criminal 
to waste this precious opportunity on any material but 
the best that the children can appreciate. 
If the children of a school are found to be reading
-P-A-G-E-28
  22 What Children Study and Why 
“ Battered Bill, the Bloody Broncho-Buster,” or “ The 
Poisoned Gum Drop, or the Candy Woman’s Revenge,” 
it is an indication that the teaching of reading has not 
filled its full measure of possibility; a taste for better 
literature has not been developed. The reading matter 
may have been merely combinations of words to illustrate 
a “method.” It may have been serious literature 
beyond the present capacity of the children, or it may 
have been fragmentary and dissociated excerpts from 
good literature, insufficient to create a standard or to 
develop a desire to read more of like character. Even 
if the books contain good selections in the form of 
literary wholes, they may have been treated merely as 
reading lessons to the exclusion of their higher ends, 
— for all these are causes of lack of love for good litera- 
ture. 
The Reading Lesson a Study of Literature. — The 
reading lesson especially, of all the lessons in the day’s 
program, should be not a task but a pleasure. It should 
always be reading literature to get at the thought and the 
spirit of what is read, —in manner as nearly like reading 
out of school as possible, only more thorough and more 
appreciative. It should always be a careful and sym- 
pathetic study of the selection. Moreover, the children 
while being introduced to the delights of the author 
whose production is read should be tempted by suggestion 
to read more from the same author at home. The teacher 
of reading should be in close alliance with the public 
library, if such an institution exists. The establishment 
of libraries in schools is fortunately a rapidly growing 
custom. Such a library of well-selected books of general 
literature, adapted to the needs and capacities of chil-
-P-A-G-E-29
  
Reading 23 
dren, makes possible the development of the reading 
lesson into a literary feast. 
Reading Poetry.—It is especially important that 
poetry be carefully, persistently, «nd sympathetically 
read and studied in school. Teachers sometimes skip 
the poetic selections in the reading book because either 
they or the children “do not like poetry.” Poetry is 
the highest form of literature, and for that reason is 
“ caviare to the vulgar.” More than any other form 
it needs to be interpreted to the children. They need 
to be led to see that poetic expression is not only 
the most beautiful, but is also the most effective and 
forceful, of all forms of literary art. Much emphasis 
should be laid upon the study of figures of speech, 
of rhyme and rhythm. The teacher, if a good reader 
(and the teacher should always be a good reader), 
should read aloud to the school choice poetry, that the 
children may catch from the modulated voice that unde- 
finable, subtle musical quality which is the spirit of true 
poetry. | 
The Mechanics of Reading Necessary. — Of course the 
elemental object of teaching reading must not be lost sight 
of. The children are, first of all, to learn to read, to 
acquire power in the interpretation of the printed symbols 
of thought. Especially in the lower grades, the mechanics 
of the subject, the recognition of words and the art of 
naming new words by analyzing them into their sonant 
elements, must be rigorously taught, to make possible 
the study of the literature read. But the two processes 
should go on side by side. They are reciprocal. If the 
literature read appeals to the children, they are easily 
induced to perform the mechanical drudgery necessary
-P-A-G-E-30
  24 What Children Study and Why 
toits mastery. Ifit.does not appeal to them, their learn- 
ing to read becomes an arduous task and they look else- 
where for their pleasurable reading. 
Reading in Higher Grades. — In most schools reading 
is taught throughout the primary grades rigorously, even 
if not wisely, but too often in the higher grades it is 
neglected. It is not uncommon to find daily programs in 
grammar schools with no place for reading. Here is 
obviously the very best place for developing taste, be- 
cause the children are more mature and better capable of 
appreciating good literature. Here, especially, the read- 
ing should be of literary wholes, unmodified by the over 
anxious editor. The grammar school pupil does not 
need to have his mental food predigested. 
Grading Reading. — The principle of grading employed 
in making too many readers is wrong. Readers above 
the second or third should be graded according to thought 
rather than words. If the subject matter is comprehen- 
sible and interesting to the children, they will master the 
words even if they are “ hard.” But easy words do not 
make easy reading of selections whose thought is beyond 
the children: 
This points to two opposing errors found in some pres- 
ent-day reading books. In those of one kind, good litera- 
ture is “ written down” to the capacities of the unhappy 
children. I have even known such delightful and childlike 
selections as Irving’s ‘‘ Rip Van Winkle ” and “ Legend 
of Sleepy Hollow” to be made over for the children. 
This is little less than literary murder ; nor is it necessary, 
for the reason given above. The other error is in giving 
profound writings to children because the words are 
simple. Gray’s “ Elegy in a Country Churchyard” I
-P-A-G-E-31
  Reading 25 
have seen in a reader for intermediate grades, where it 
is manifestly out of place. The whole thought and spirit 
of the poem require mature minds for their appreciation. 
The elegy, from its very nature, is unfit for young 
children, and Gray’s is no exception. One might as well 
give them “ In Memoriam,” “ Lycidas,” or “ Adonais.” 
The study that is put upon such selections by the very 
young simply spoils them for later enjoyment, and drives 
the pupils to the Nickel Horror. On the other hand, 
many of Shakespeare’s plays make admirable~reading 
matter for the grammar school. The vital interest in the 
story and the dramatic action carry the pupils over the 
difficulties of the vocabulary. 
The principle is plain. Give children the very choicest 
literature that they can appreciate and enjoy, but don’t 
force them, and above all don’t spoil choice literature 
by making it over for reading lessons ahead of its turn. 
Wait till the children are ready for it as the author 
made it. 
The worst instance of this sort of desecration is re- 
writing in simple prose the story of a choice poem. 
The story is but one element of the poem and usually is 
the least important, except as a skeleton. But it is 
necessary to the poem asa whole. There are good stories 
enough for children of all grades, written in suitable 
language, without filching the hearts out of choice poems. 
Even great authors cannot write over great poems suc- 
cessfully. Though children in the grammar grades love 
to read Shakespeare, as a rule they do not care for Lamb’s 
“Tales from Shakespeare.” 
Give children an abundance of good literature as it 
came from the pens of genius, in wholes and unspoiled,
-P-A-G-E-32

4. READING ALOUD 
The third of the functions of the reading lesson is to 
give the ability to read aloud to the edification and en- 
joyment of listeners, to reproduce orally, with exact- 
ness in word and in spirit, the thought expressed on the 
page. 
In the school reading lesson, especially in the earlier 
years, reading aloud is a necessary part of the exercise, 
the proof that the pupil can read. In later years it is a 
fine art too often ignored. 
The Nature of Reading Aloud. — Reading, it will be 
recalled, is getting the thought from the symbol, either 
immediately upon observation, or mediately through 
imaging the sounds of the spoken word. Reading aloud 
is going a step farther and uttering the words after the 
thought has been grasped. The distinction needs to be 
made between merely calling the words phonically and 
reading them. To utter the sounds r-u-n in quick suc- 
cession as the word run while thinking merely of the 
sonant elements is not to read run. Reading involves 
conceiving the idea run, and oral reading means speaking 
the word run as expressive of the idea. This is important 
as having a distinct bearing upon the method of teaching 
the art, as will be evident later. 
Elements of Oral Reading. — Oral reading involves, on 
its mechanical side, breathing, vocalization, enunciation, 
and pronunciation. In the primary classes breathing 
and vocalization may be taken for granted. Correct 
breathing and the production of pure tones are of course 
important, but there is little time for their consideration 
in the ordinary primary school. As a rule, too, the
-P-A-G-E-33
  Reading a7 
breathing and the voices of children are more natural 
and hence better than those of adults. 
Enunciation and Pronunciation. — But enunciation 
and pronunciation must receive stress from the first. 
By good enunciation is meant the distinct utterance of 
the various vowel and consonant sounds involved in 
speaking a word. By good pronunciation is meant the 
utterance of the word as a whole correctly, with proper 
accent, as determined by standard authorities. To 
“slur” letters, to give incorrect or indistinct sounds 
to letters, to run them together, —to say bein’ for being; 
or p’r’aps for perhaps; gentlemun for gentleman; New 
Yawk for New York; woild for world; histry for history; 
jogerphy for geography, — these are common instances 
of bad enunciation. . 
“ Watchuthinknof? ” looks Slavic, but it is quite com- 
mon American. 
To say Euro’ pean for European, haow for how, noo for 
new, threw for through, colyum for column, hor'izon for 
horiz'on, interes'ted for in’terested, is to pronounce in- 
correctly. : 
These two classes of errors are sure to show their heads 
continually in school, and must be hit whenever they 
appear; but the reading lesson affords the best op- 
portunity for dealing with them systematically. They 
arise from various causes, chief among which is habit 
acquired in the home and on the street. 
Faulty enunciation is often due to some defect of the 
vocal organs, and faulty pronunciation to ignorance pure 
and simple. To correct these errors should be a princi- 
pal object of the reading lesson, because they are serious 
defects, not merely in reading, but in all utterance, and
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 What Children Study and Why 
are likely materially to affect future success among men. 
The world over, the method of utterance is one of the 
accepted standards of cultivation. 
Correcting Faulty Enunciation. — How may faults of 
enunciation be removed? In most cases, only by per- 
sistent efforts to secure correct utterance, and the sub- 
stitution of good habits for bad. In case of physical 
defects the assistance of a surgeon may be required, 
though often a simple course of exercises will furnish all 
the remedy needed. Stuttering, for example, is usually 
due to a diseased or overstimulated nervous system, and 
except in extreme cases can be helped or even cured by 
enforced deliberation of utterance, regularly persisted in. 
Difficulty in uttering distinctly particular letters, as s 
or 1, can usually be overcome by steady, deliberate practice 
in uttering them. Some instruction at first may be 
needed as to the proper disposition of tongue, teeth, or 
lips to produce the correct sound. 
Of the bad habits, the most common, and the most 
disastrous as well, is that of slurring letters, both vowels 
and consonants. Few adults, even of liberal education, 
utter their words clearly, through to the finish. We have 
no time toenounce. We telegraph our message, omitting 
every sound not absolutely required to give its meaning. 
Such exercises as reading or reciting words, verses, or 
sentences with great deliberation and with over emphasis 
upon all sounds are helpful. Drill upon the utterance 
of such words as in-di-vis-i-bi-li-ty, giving the short 
sound to 7 in each syllable, is valuable, as is the use of 
the old enunciation puzzles, as “ A big black bear bit a 
big black bug,” ‘“‘ Round the rugged rock the ragged 
rascal ran,” “ Peter Piper nicked a peck of pickled pep-
-P-A-G-E-35
Reading 29 
pers,” with the good old “ Theophilus Thistle, the cele- 
brated thistle sifter, while sifting a sieve full of unsifted 
thistles, thrust three thousand thistles through the thick 
of his thumb,” repeated in various forms. The reading 
or reciting of poems or prose selections markedly onomat- 
opoetic makes good drillin enunciation; for example, Poe’s 
“ Bells,” Montgomery’s “Arnold von Winkelried,” 
Byron’s “ Destruction of Sennacherib,” Southey’s ‘‘ How 
the Waters Come Down at Lodore,”’ Tennyson’s “The 
Splendor Falls,”’ Dryden’s ‘‘ Ode toSt. Cecilia,” Dickens’s 
description of the locksmith in ‘‘ Barnaby Rudge,” Chap. 
XLI. : 
The selections for practice should be made with ref- 
erence to the particular defects or habits to be remedied. 
It is well to begin with the younger children by reading 
to them short selections that bring out prominently 
certain sounds asking them to indicate those sounds 
and to reproduce them. For the ear is frequently the 
cause of bad enunciation. It does not always distin- 
guish sounds and must be trained to hear accurately. 
I recall an argument with a lady, whose whole life 
had been spent in New York City, over the sound of the 
letter 7. She had the local habit of slurring it or of 
dropping it altogether. But she insisted that she did 
pronounce it. Finally I discovered that apparently her 
ear could not perceive the ordinary sound of r at all. 
She could not, for instance, distinguish between are and 
ah, when spoken. Only over emphasis and a prolonged 
trilling of the sound enabled her to perceive it. 
A distinguished bishop tells of visiting an English 
laborer’s family at dinner time. 
The principal article of food was some delicious York- 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  30 What Children Study and Why 
shire ham. The laborer’s son, after consuming a gener- 
ous portion, asked for more, and this conversation 
ensued: 
Boy — “ Dad, H’Id like some more ’am.” 
Father — “ You mean ’am, my son.” 
Boy — “ That’s wot I said: I said ’am.” 
Father — “ No, you said, ’am.” 
Mother (aside to Bishop) — “ ’Ear ’em. They both 
think they said ’am.” ‘ 
Although a thoroughly bad enunciation is perhaps 
seldom wholly corrected, careful instruction, much 
practice, and never ceasing insistence, especially in the 
reading lesson, can accomplish much. 
Correcting Faulty Pronunciation. — Faulty pronuncia- 
tion, especially if taken early, can be remedied much 
more easily. As has been said, in many cases it is due 
to ignorance. This requires merely acquaintance with 
the correct standard. In other cases it is habit, which 
calls for attention and insistence. Usually, too, faulty 
pronunciation is limited to a comparatively few words. 
The greatest difficulty is likely to be provincial pro- 
nunciation, due to customs prevailing in localities and 
sometimes in whole regions. Such are the New England 
yew for you, hev for have, stupenjus for stupendous, goom 
for gum. The Pennsylvania cddéow for cow, ma for md, 
the Southern ah for J, the Irish charac'ter. 
The difficulty with this class of errors is not merely 
fixed habit, but inability to distinguish the sounds by 
the ear. Even teachers, working in the locality where 
they have been brought up, cannot detect the familiar 
errors of pronunciation committed by the children, but 
are guilty of them themselves. It is only by a careful   
     
-P-A-G-E-37
  Reading 31 
training of the ear and a constant study of standards 
that errors of pronunciation, either provincial or per- 
sonal, can be eradicated. One of the best means of 
correcting our own faults of sound-perception and of 
sound-production is to listen closely to cultivated public 
speakers, and especially to good actors, people whose 
business it is to be right in these respects. In case of 
doubt always consult a dictionary. 
The two faults of speech above mentioned as common 
in oral reading are all that can be attended to profitably 
in the earlier primary grades while the children are 
mastering the symbols. But false modes of breathing 
and bad qualities of voice must be remedied before 
reading aloud as an art and as a source of pleasure is 
possible. 3 
These two subjects belong so largely to the specialist 
that I shall not attempt to treat them at length, but 
shall only give a few suggestions as to exercises that may 
be employed in the schoolroom in connection with the 
reading lesson. These can be introduced into the inter- 
mediate grades with advantage. 
The breathing should be full and deep. Breathing 
exercises, filling the lungs to the bottom, just before read- 
ing, are helpful. To begin a sentence with the lungs 
nearly empty necessitates an early break in the reading. 
The breath should be taken in through the nostrils. 
Practice in deep breathing through the nose and giving 
out the breath very slowly through the mouth, clearly 
vocalized, allowing no breath to escape without produc- 
ing tone, if repeated regularly, will greatly improve the 
breathing of a class while reading. 
The production of good tone is really easier to secure
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 What Children Study and Why 
than good breathing. The common faults of tone in 
school reading are, among the boys, a hard and un- 
natural tone and excessive nasality, and among the 
girls, high pitch and an ear-splitting, shrill quality. Both 
boys and girls talk, if they do not read, too loudly and 
noisily. This fault continued to adult years and in- 
tensified has made the ‘‘ American voice” justly an 
object of unpleasant comment. 
How can we get soft, tuneful, clear voices? Only 
through much practice and continued insistence. In the 
first place the teacher’s voice should possess these quali- 
ties, a condition, alas! seldom fulfilled. Children un- 
consciously imitate. A noisy teacher makes a noisy 
school. 
It is essential to avoid shouting in all exercises. Make 
plain the difference between force and noise. Practice 
whispering to a distance. Especially have much read- 
ing and reciting of literature, calling for the quality the 
opposite of the one to be corrected, as, for a harsh voice, 
lullabies, such as “‘ Sweet and Low,” “ O, hush thee, my 
Baby”; for a high-pitched, shrill voice, “ By Nebo’s 
lonely mountain,” or “Not a drum was heard”; for a 
nasal voice, Byron’s “‘ Apostrophe to the Ocean,” “ Roll 
on thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll,’ or Carthon’s 
“ Apostrophe to the Sun,” “O thou that rollest above, 
round as the shield of my fathers.” In all cases try to 
have the voice reflect the sentiment. These are merely 
suggestive exercises for correcting glaring errors of vocal- 
ization. 
The Art of Reading Aloud. — The art of reading aloud, 
now so nearly obsolete, is one of the most generally 
attractive of all the arts. It is especially effective for
-P-A-G-E-39
Reading 33 
poetry, oratory, fiction, and dramatic writings. Pure 
literature, interpreted by a genuine and sympathetic 
artist, shares with song, ‘‘ Music married to immortal 
verse,” the honor of being the most human and the most 
divine of arts. 
“And lend to the rhyme of the poet 
The beauty of thy voice.”

  CHAPTER III

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
Ir isnot the aim of this book to discuss methods very 
much in detail. Indeed, the term “ method ” as used 
in teaching has fallen into a certain disrepute, because 
it has been badly misused, and mere devices, which usu- 
ally should be left to the ingenuity of the teachers, have 
been heralded as “ methods.” In this book the term 
“methods” always means simply a way of doing things, 
based upon principles. 
There is a Best Way. — Necessarily there is a best way 
of doing everything that is to be done, but not a univer- 
sally best way. The best way for me may not be the 
best way for you, and the best way for me to-day or 
with Johnny Jones may not be the best way to-morrow 
or with Maggie Brown. 
Yet there are principles underlying all methods which 
may not be violated with impunity. Variation is 
possible in the application, but not in the principle. 
The first thing to consider in determining the method 
of teaching any subject is the purpose of teaching it, — 
its place in the economy of education. That, settled, 
determines the standard by which all methods may be 
measured. 
The Proper Bases. — The next things to consider are 
the nature of the subject, — its meaning and its logic, — 
and the laws of growth of the minds of the individual 
34
-P-A-G-E-41
  Methods of Instruction 35 
learners, especially as related to the subject under con- 
sideration; for an example, how can the pupil best 
attain the end aimed at through the study of language, 
considering the nature of language and his mental state 
regarding it? 
Psychology or Logic. — Here we come upon the old 
question: Shall psychology or logic determine the method 
of teaching a subject? Shall the nature of the subject 
or the nature of the child be the dominant influence? 
Shall the method of nature study, for example, be for the 
development of the child’s powers of observation, dis- 
covery, and reasoning, or shall it be for verifying the 
classifications of science ? 
I once heard a schoolman say, while we were watching 
a class of children studying beetles, “‘ To begin the study 
of the beetle at the wrong end is a pedagogical crime.” 
I should say that to try to make the child see the beetle 
in any other than the natural way of seeing is a peda- 
gogical crime. The order of procedure is determined 
by his mental state and his opportunities for observation 
and not by the shape of the bug. This principle applies 
in all teaching, whatever the topic. The child must 
learn as he can. Any attempt to force or to change the 
processes of his mental action results in waste or disaster. 
Must vary with Age. — Naturally, methods must vary 
as children advance in age and in mental power. 
“Nature study” progresses toward science, ‘“ number 
work ” toward arithmetic, and “ language study ”’ to- 
ward grammar and rhetoric. The casual observation 
becomes orderly, the unconsidered expression becomes 
definite, but solely because the child’s mental state is 
different. In most cases, though not in all, the methods
-P-A-G-E-42
  36 What Children Study and Why 
here considered will be those applicable to the beginning 
of a particular study. 
With this understanding of ‘‘ method,” we will proceed 
to its application to the subject of reading. 
METHODS OF TEACHING READING 
There are many methods of teaching reading to begin- 
ners, all of which, however, fall into a few classes deter- 
mined by the unit of study, whether the letter, the sound, 
or the sentence. 
The Alphabetical. Method.— The alphabetical or 
spelling method was in universal use until comparatively 
recent times. This is hardly worthy of being classed as 
a method. It is merely the unconsidered way in which 
reading was taught before scientific method had received 
serious thought. Its unit was the letter as named, and 
as combined on the printed page with other letters into 
words. The oral significance of letters was scarcely 
even thought of. As the first step in learning to read, 
the children “ learned their letters” by name and ap- 
pearance. Next they learned simple combinations as 
a-b ab, b-a ba, always arbitrarily and without conscious 
recognition of the sonant value of the letters. It is 
probable that there was, at least in some cases, a sub- 
conscious recognition of sound values, especially of 
vowels; but if such recognition existed, it never advanced 
into consciousness. The child never became aware of 
a synthesis of sounds in bat differing at all from the names 
be-a-te. Yet though the process was necessarily slow 
and painful, children learned to read by it, relying on 
memory and sight. Its great defect was not its awk- 
wardness and slowness, but what is still the great defect
-P-A-G-E-43
  Methods of Instruction By, 
of all its direct and collateral descendants, namely, that 
_ reading in its earlier stages was not reading at all, but 
merely calling syllan es and words. 
Two Classes of Methods.— With the development 
of educational science in the latter half of the nineteenth 
century, reading naturally received early attention. 
. The faults of the old way were manifest to even shallow 
observers. Hence many teachers set about devising 
new methods. These efforts fall into one or other of the 
two classes into which all modern methods of teaching 
‘reading fall — the one logical, the other psychological. 
The former takes as its unit the sound of the letter; 
the other, the whole word or sentence as expressing an 
idea or a thought. There are several so-called methods 
for which their authors claim great merit, in both these 
classes. Some indeed claim the merits of both classes. 
It is necessary, therefore, to bear in mind the funda- 
mental determining difference, which is the door of ap- 
proach, whether the sounds of the letters or the ideas or 
thoughts represented by the symbols. 
Phonic Methods. — The various phonic methods, by 
whatever special name they are called, are the direct 
development of the original alphabetical method. The 
sound of the letter has taken the place of the name, 
_and the synthesis of the sounds that make the spoken 
word has become conscious and purposeful. The aim is 
simple, to secure the recognition, in the graphic symbol, 
of the word already familiar as spoken. The method 
is logical rather than psychological. That is, it follows 
the orderly development of the word considered as a 
mechanical structure, and not the laws of growth of the 
mind of the child or his natural way of learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
38 What Children Study and Why 
The earliest of these methods to gain general recogni- 
tion was called correctly “‘ the synthctic method.” It 
was more radical than any of its successors. The first 
step was the recognition of the sounds of the letters. 
To secure this, much drill was given upon single letters. 
Then these were combined by sounds into pronounceable 
groups, which were sometimes words, sometimes recogniz- 
able syllables, and sometimes mere meaningless aggre- 
gations, usually representing “ families,” as the at family, 
the op family, and the like. The children were drilled 
upon such lists as, 
at 
bat 
cat 
dat 
lat 
In order to make possible the study of all the sounds 
of the letters, an intricate system of diacritical marking 
was employed, creating practically a new alphabet, in 
which every sonant element of English words was sup- 
posed to be represented by a character. Later these 
phonic groups, or “ phonograms,”’ were used in the build- 
ing of words, after which children began to read. 
This was a carefully thought out and logical system. 
Within certain very manifest limits it produced notable 
results. Undeniably children acquired extraordinary 
facility in using the marked letters to build the family — 
the combination of sounds — unhampered by any con- 
sideration of purpose. They worked for synthesized 
sounds, and they got them. Moreover, the facility ac- 
quired was of real service in the detection of new words 
as they occurred in the reading lesson. For a time
-P-A-G-E-45
Methods of Instruction 39 
the apparent progress of the children was truly aston- 
ishing. 
The defects of the system, however, were no less notable. 
One of them has already been mentioned as the greatest 
defect of the alphabetical method, namely, that “ read- 
ing ” was, at first, not reading at all, but merely calling 
words, the meaningless repetition of synthesized sounds; 
and all the evil characteristics of the old methods were 
present, — the hard voice, the uniform modulation, the 
pause between words, the unvarying stress upon all 
words important and unimportant. 
Then, when introduced to words without diacritical 
marks, the children were somewhat like cripples whose 
crutches had been taken away. It took time and effort 
to reduce the alphabet to the conventional twenty-six 
letters. So, even in the matter of time, the apparent 
saving at the beginning was often lost in the later delays 
incident to really learning to read. Moreover, the desir- 
able influence upon all the later reading of the first im- 
pression that reading is getting thought was, of course, 
forever lost. 
Phonics and Spelling. — Perhaps the most peculiar 
effect of this phonic method was that upon spelling. It 
seemed practically impossible for children accustomed to 
the luxury of a complete phonetic alphabet ever to adjust 
themselves to the peculiarities of English orthography. 
The truly “ phonetized ” children continued to spell, 
years after, in a manner that would have rejoiced the 
heart of the laird of Skibo. 
The purely synthetic method, though heralded as the 
great emancipator from the bondage of the primer, did 
not long survive, but it left a healthy family of de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  40 What Children Study and Why 
scendants more or less resembling it, which we still have 
with us. 
Later Phonic Systems. — In general these have uni- 
form characteristics. They are mainly analytico-syn- 
thetic. The sounds, instead of being stated arbitrarily 
as belonging to certain letters, are “developed” from 
words and then recombined: rat becomes r-d-t, the 
sounds only being given. The “ family” relation is 
still maintained, but the combinations made are strictly 
of words, the meaningless aggregations of sounds such 
as dat and lat being no longer allowed. 
This change indicates a tendency on the part of the ad- 
vocates of phonetic teaching toward sounder educational 
principles. The presentation of a whole word is at least 
a partial recognition of the way a child naturally learns 
things. It is to be feared, however, that even yet in too 
many instances the word is presented as a combination 
of sounds rather than as the symbol of an idea. The 
word rat does not stand so much for the interesting, if 
unpopular, little rodent whose name it is, as for the 
synthesis of the three sounds represented by the letters 
r-G-t. 
There are so many further modifications of so-called 
phonic reading that it is impossible to follow them, 
Surely even Mrs. Pollard would be unable to recognize 
some of the descendants of her scheme. But these 
modifications are all in more or less full recognition of a 
psychological basis of teaching. Some go so far as to 
present entire sentences and even whole verses for in- 
spection by the children — a sort of by-guess reading — 
and to encourage the recognition of some words as words 
before taking up the phonic analysis. Every step to-
-P-A-G-E-47
Methods of Instruction 41 
ward making “ reading ” always reading, the getting of 
thought, and using all mechanical devices merely as aids, 
is encouraging. 
Danger in Secondary Ends. — Of course it is claimed 
that this is the purpose of all phonic systems. Doubtless 
in the mind of the teacher it is, but in the mind of the 
young child the manifest aim is the real aim, and untold 
harm is done in our schools by presenting continually 
secondary ends rather than primary. This error is 
common not merely in the reading lesson, but in other 
subjects as well, and especially in creating motives for 
study and even for conduct. The eye of the child 
should whenever possible be kept upon the real end in 
view. This has an immediate bearing upon the creation 
of ideals and the development of character. In many 
instances it may be impossible to do this; the real end 
may be too remote and abstruse for the child to grasp, 
but usually it is possible — certainly in many more in- 
stances than our school practice would indicate. In 
teaching reading it is not only possible but easy. “ Read- 
ing ” can as easily be reading as the mere calling of words. 
English not Phonetic. — Even with this higher con- 
sideration aside, there are fundamental linguistic reasons 
why “ phonics ” can never be the real basis of instruction 
in reading. Our language is not a phonetic language. 
Because of its history, of the many elements that have 
entered into its composition, and especially of the dis- 
tortions that it has suffered at the hands of ignorant early 
printers and of many pseudo-philologists, a very large 
part of its syllables are purely arbitrary combinations 
of letters which must be committed to memory, without 
aid from logic, or science. So large a part of the words 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    
42 What Children Study and Why 
in common use are thus irregular that attempts to form 
scientific classifications, instead of aiding the memory, 
merely cause confusion. 
Take, for instance, one of the most reliable of the rules, 
that a final e, silent after a single consonant, lengthens 
the short vowel preceding the consonant. This is usually 
given to children very early, as one of the laws suitable 
for infant minds, and it is one of the guideposts to the 
foreigner trying to thread his way among the crossroads 
of our language. The start is nimble: tap, tape; rip, 
ripe; cap, cape; and so forth. But soon come fare, 
hare, bare, and perhaps thirty more. Well, we will 
classify these as an exception and go on. We have not 
gone far when we run upon dove, love, above, and a long 
list — another exception. And so with halve, salve, and 
the like, and then live, give, are, were, and the rest, until 
the exceptional instances seem to outnumber the regulars. 
And yet, as I have said, this is one of the most reliable 
of the rules ; indeed, it is almost the only one of sufficient 
embrace to be of much consequence. From this com- 
parative regularity all the way to ough with its eight 
different pronunciations is a road strewn with “ troubles.” 
The diacritical markings are merely danger signs, useful 
so long as they remain, but leaving panic when removed. 
Is it not vastly better to teach reading as reading and 
get such assistance from phonics as we can, than to 
overwork this valuable aid, misrepresent values, and 
fail at least of the higher results? 
Psychological Methods.—Of the psychological meth- 
ods of teaching reading to beginners there are two 
general classes, one taking for its unit the word, repre- 
senting an idea, the other taking the sentence, repre-
-P-A-G-E-49
Methods of Instruction 43 
senting a complete thought. In both, the meaning of 
the word rather than its phonetic composition receives 
the first consideration. 
The Word Method. — The word method in operation is 
simplicity itself. A familiar object is presented before 
the children and named by them. The name is then 
written on the blackboard. Thus the written and 
visible symbol of the name of a familiar object becomes 
associated with the same name as known to the ear. 
The child becomes, as to the word, eye-minded. After 
the names of several objects have been learned in this 
way, a few necessary connecting and descriptive words, 
as verbs and adjectives, are taught. Thus the child 
becomes possessed of a small working vocabulary. Next, 
sentences are constructed of these words and read by the 
children. So far the process is one of simple word 
memory. The words are treated first as wholes by them- 
selves and then as parts of a sentence. Here lie both the 
strength and the weakness of the method. 
Tests of the Word Method. — The real tests are two: 
x. Are the pupils to go on indefinitely memorizing new 
words as wholes, Chinese fashion? 2. Can the words 
treated thus independently be united smoothly into sen- 
tences, so that reading shall be repeating thoughts and 
not merely calling words? 
Necessity of Spelling. —As to the first test, naturally 
the words must ultimately be broken up into their sonant 
elements and these elements must be used in building 
other words; that is, children must learn to spell and to 
recognize new words by spelling before rapid progress 
can be made in learning to read. Here comes the claim 
of the phonic teacher. By phonics the children learn 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  44 What Children Study and Why 
these sonant elements of words and are made independent 
in reading new words. This would be true enough if our 
language were a phonetically regular language, but it is 
not, as has been stated above, and attempts to teach by 
a phonetic system, when such a system includes so little, 
results in artificiality and teaching much that “ isn’t so.” 
Children who learn to read by the word method must 
early learn to spell. But this spelling must be in the 
old-fashioned way of memory, aided here and there by 
those few phonic facts that are of general significance. 
Some of these may be taught by rule, though the many 
exceptions are likely to make most of the rules confusing 
rather than illumining. Most of the phonic facts will be 
grasped by the children by a sort of unconscious generali- 
zation. Colonel Parker, who was an advocate of the 
word method, used to insist that this unconscious generali- 
zation was sufficient and that the children needed no 
special drill in phonics. 
How Children Learn. — Of the two, a purely phonic 
system and a word method with its spelling unaided by 
formal phonics, the latter unquestionably rests on a 
sounder psychological basis; it is more nearly like the 
way in which children acquire their first knowledge of 
the world in many phases. The most familiar objects 
are learned first singly by memory alone. Then the 
mind unaided forms a simple generalization. Acquaint- 
ance is first made with Towser, the family dog. Then 
every dog is Towser. Later Towser and all the rest 
become dogs. But the generalization was first made un- 
aided and unconsciously, when the neighbor’s dog was 
called Towser. 
Whatever may be its other faults or merits, the word
-P-A-G-E-51
  Methods of Instruction 45 
method at least employs the same unit and order that 
the child uses in learning to talk. The baby first recog- 
nizes objects through their action upon some one or 
more of the senses. Then he learns to associate with 
these sensations certain regular impressions made upon 
his auditory nerve, until at length he knows the word 
heard as belonging to the object. Later, after much 
effort, he learns to utter the word himself, and this with- 
out any conscious analysis of it into its sonant elements, 
without any instruction as to the character and mode 
of action of his vocal organs. 
Word Method Natural.— This method, using the 
\ whole word as the unit of instruction, is the purely 
natural method; most other methods, called natural, 
) are really. artificial attempts to substitute the laws of 
logic for those of infant development. 
Place of Analysis. — The word method, however, may 
be greatly aided by an analysis of the words, after a suffi- 
cient vocabulary has been acquired, and reading has so 
far advanced, as reading, that the children may with 
profit turn aside to consider analytically the material 
with which they are dealing. There should be much 
spelling of words, both oral and written, both by letters 
and by sounds. Words, too, should be grouped for spell- 
ing according to their phonic elements, as bar, car, far, 
mar, to be followed by bare, care, fare, mare — but this 
without the formal rule which requires an explanation 
of the troublesome exceptions. All that is valuable in the 
analogies will be grasped unconsciously through the as- 
sociation. 
Other useful exercises are writing and observing words 
first with and then without suffixes and plural forms, as   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 What Children Study and Why 
bird, birds, think, thinking, and especially words divided 
into syllables. Uncertainty as to syllabication is 
perhaps the greatest danger from the word method, and 
needs to be carefully guarded against both in enunciation 
and in writing. Rules, however, for all of these facts 
may well be left for the language lesson. Indeed, they 
are of much greater consequence in the complementary 
art of writing than in reading itself. 
Marking Silent Letters. — There is one so-called aid to 
reading that is especially vicious. Irefer to the writing or 
printing of words with the “ silent letters ” crossed out. 
Such a device may be resorted to by the teacher, occa- 
sionally, when writing on the blackboard, merely to save 
time. But the presentation to children, in the first 
stages of learning to read, of a printed page containing 
words having some of the letters crossed off gives false 
impressions of the looks of the words at the outset and 
prepares the way for future trouble. Because, whatever 
may be the value of “ phonics” as an aid to reading, 
reading itself, as practiced, consists in instant and rapid 
recognition of words as wholes, and it is of the utmost 
importance that children get correct impressions of words 
as they look on the page. The sole value of phonic analysis 
at its best is in aiding children to call correctly new words; 
but when this aid perverts the appearance of the word, 
it becomes a hindrance to ready reading. 
The Sentence Method. — A third class of methods for 
teaching beginners to read is based upon using as the 
unit the sentence, representing a complete thought. 
This is like the word method in that it is pyschological 
rather than logical. It differs from it in treating the 
child as having advanced beyond the stage where knowl-
-P-A-G-E-53
Methods of Instruction 47 
edge comes in single unconnected words to that where 
he both comprehends and uses the complete sentence — 
the statement, the question, the command. The step 
from doll, milk to “ This is my doll,” “‘ Give me some 
milk,” is psychologically a very long one, but it is taken 
long before the child comes to school. 
The sentence method recognizes this fact and presents 
to the children as the first reading lesson a complete 
expression of a thought. The thought is naturally a very 
simple one and the sentences at first are very short. But 
they are sentences, and the first reading of them is genuine 
reading and not merely calling words. Whether the first 
lesson is “ This is Helen” or the command “ Run,” 
speaking it as a whole is reading. The very first im- 
pression of the act of reading is the true one. There is 
nothing to be undone afterward. The painful effort to 
make real words of the synthesized meaningless sounds, 
or to group the words into sentences, is spared. This is 
certainly a great gain. 
Different Plans.—Some teachers of the sentence 
method would use first sentences made by the children 
and written upon the blackboard, so that the children 
may recognize the symbols of their own spoken thoughts. 
This plan is sure to produce vivid impressions and to give 
a vital interest to the reading lesson. 
Others would have the first lesson descriptive of an act 
performed by or before the children, as I walk, we jump, 
or of a command to do something, as Run, Jump, Open 
the door. ‘This also makes reading vital and insures 
interest. It makes it possible, morecver, to make the 
first sentence very short; even one word will suffice for 
a command.
-P-A-G-E-54
  48 What Children Study and Why 
Of course these first sentences must be followed by 
many more in which the same words are used in many 
different relations. Some teachers would develop the 
words first. This is almost a reversion to the word 
method. Others would merely see to it that the words 
are recognized wherever they occur. These are matters 
of detail. 
The reading of sentences must be followed, however, 
later by the study of words and the various spelling and 
phonic exercises suggested to go with the word method. 
‘Sentence the Best Unit. — On the whole I incline to 
the opinion that the sentence is the best unit in teaching 
reading; that it makes reading more natural and more 
interesting; that children taught in this way are more 
likely later to grasp whole phrases and sentences at a 
glance, which is the secret of economical and appre- 
ciative reading. 
Use of Larger Units. — Indeed, some radical teachers 
favor presenting first entire paragraphs or rhymes for 
indefinite recognition, that the impression of wholeness 
may be made very strong. While a very able teacher 
may succeed with such a method, it is to be feared that 
in the ordinary school it would result in vague, unprofit- 
able guessing at words. 
Special Methods. —- There are certain patent methods 
of teaching reading which cannot easily be classed as 
either psychological or philological. They belong by 
themselves and had best perhaps be called unpsychologi- 
cal. One consists in taking some selections of children’s 
literature, chopping them up into words, presenting 
these words in new relations, often without sense, with 
the hope that thus the children will learn them and ulti-
-P-A-G-E-55
  Methods of Instruction 49 
mately will come back to the literature. Sometimes 
a single word taken from a children’s jingle is used in 
forty or fifty consecutive sentences, most of them having 
the slightest meaning. 
This system has for its advocates many unthinking 
people to whom the word “ literary ” bears a charmed 
meaning, and they think that they are teaching by a 
literary method if they use this. As a matter of fact, 
the method might be properly called an anti-literary 
method. The child who has had these fifty sentences, 
all with one key word, when he comes back to the original 
story is sure to be affected with nausea. It is hard to 
conceive a method of teaching reading more sure to 
produce distaste for the whole subject than this. To 
make matters worse, this and some other special methods 
are so unnatural that they require special manuals, thus 
adding greatly to the burden of overworked teachers. 
Teaching reading is not such a difficult matter that 
it requires all this fuss. In most cases the special method 
is teaching reading by indirection, by something that is 
not reading. Its advocates point to marvelous results, 
but it should be remembered that children, like animals, 
can be taught any trick, if care enough is given to it. 
But to teach a number of things only loosely associated 
with reading does not necessarily lead to reading at all; 
quite frequently it leads away from it. The test comes 
in the higher grades, and after many years of observation. 
I have never seen pupils in the higher grades of schools 
who have been taught by any patent method whose 
reading was superior to that of those who had been 
taught by simple and natural methods, and in most 
cases I have found it to be inferior, in spite of all the 
ae
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 What Children Study and Why 
extra time and effort and the agony of teacher and child 
in mastering an awkward scheme. 
Whatever the method, the first reading should always 
be of words familiar to the children. The earliest lesson 
should not attempt to add to the pupil’s vocabulary; 
that comes later. 
So much for method in the first lessons in reading. 
Is nothing to be said as to the conduct of the reading 
lesson beyond the primer and first reader stage? 
Reading in Intermediate Grades. — The intermediate 
grades really offer very interesting problems. As a rule 
they are the weakest spots in our schools. The lower and 
the higher grades have received much more thought, much 
more scientific study. Yet in these intermediate grades 
the future tastes and inclinations of the great majority of 
the children are determined, in so far as the school deter- 
mines them. If the ability to read rapidly, with compre- 
hension and with appreciation, and also with taste for good 
reading, are not secured in these grades, by far the larger 
part of the children in our schools will never secure them. 
Rapid Reading. — First, children should learn to read 
rapidly, “ to themselves.” By this I mean that they 
should be trained to grasp quickly the sense of sentences 
and even paragraphs without dwelling upon each word. 
This ability is of especial value in reading newspapers 
and other current reading matter of an ephemeral 
character, as well as much literature of a better sort, 
especially fiction. Of course I do not mean to say that 
there are not books that must be read word for word, 
with the utmost care and deliberation, but such books 
are few and constitute a very small percentage of the 
reading of most people. Most of what we read perforce
-P-A-G-E-57
  
Methods of Instruction 51 
does not justify care.ul and slow perusal, and there is 
great waste in reading it one word at a time. One some- 
times sees people of apparent intelligence reading news- 
papers, the moving lips showing that each word is being 
mentally pronounced. Such people have not really 
learned to read. 
The first essential to comprehensive reading is the 
ability to pick quickly the salient words, those that 
hold the key to the thought. This ability can be secured 
only through much practice. A good exercise to this 
end is to give the members of a class each a different 
paragraph or brief passage and allow a short fixed period 
for reading, and then to require them to give the sub- 
stance of the passages read in the fewest words possible. 
If any child has failed to grasp the thought, ask sugges- 
tive questions and let him try again. Such an exercise 
frequently repeated tends to develop comprehensive and 
rapid reading. 
Naturally such a method cannot be applied to poetry 
or to the best oratory, nor indeed with equal profit to the 
finest literature of any sort. A true literary artist makes 
every word tell, and if the art is applied to a worthy 
subject, every word should be carefully read. The reader 
who attempts to “ skip ” in reading Emerson or Brown- 
ing or Tennyson is likely to lose the best things. 
Reading with Appreciation. — This leads to the second 
point to be emphasized in reading in the higher grades, 
namely, reading with appreciation. This is a very dif- 
ferent process from the hasty reading of the daily news 
or the best selling novel. It involves a sympathetic 
spirit, catching the author’s feeling as well as compre- 
hending his thought.
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 What Children Study and Why 
To take an instance from well-known literature, see 
Lincoln’s Gettysburg Speech. The beauty, the literary 
finish, the power of this great work of art must be felt ; 
it is quite beyond mere intellectual comprehension. 
Hence, in the reading class, before attempting to read it, 
the setting should be made plain, the momentous struggle, 
the sad significance of the occasion, the heavy weight 
upon the great heart of Lincoln. Then the class is ready 
to read with subdued solemnity the noble words. Then 
each sentence and each word may be studied to see how 
in so few words such great thoughts were uttered. 
Moore’s lines furnish another illustration : 
“When day with farewell beams delays 
Among the golden clouds of even, 
And we can almost think we gaze 
Through opening vistas into Heaven, 
Those hues that mark the sun’s decline 
So grand, so beauteous, Lord, are thine.” 
The solemnity and the beauty of this passage should be 
felt by the reader while reading. 
“ Paul Revere’s Ride,” on the other hand, requires a 
quite different spirit on the part of the reader ; and “ The 
Wonderful One Hoss Shay,” a very different feeling 
indeed. 
Not to illustrate further, in the reading of choice 
literature, such as fortunately constitutes the greater 
part of the material found in most higher school readers, 
the aim should be to secure appreciative as well as com- 
prehensive reading. 
Reading Aloud. — One of the best means to this end 
is reading aloud. This is especially true of poetry.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Methods of Instruction 53 
This should include reading aloud by the teacher to the 
children, as was said in the preceding chapter. 
The older pupils can easily be trained to use their 
voices to express lightness and mirth, serious earnestness, 
beauty, awe. 
Preliminary Practice.—It is well, before reading a 
long selection of a certain dramatic character, to prac- 
tice upon short passages illustrating a similar phase of 
sentiment. For example, for practice in light and 
cheerful sentiment, not humorous, the first lines of 
Whittier’s “To a Barefoot Boy” are excellent; with 
the element of humor added, Cowper’s ‘“‘ John Gilpin’s 
Ride.” For more serious thought, the earlier stanzas 
of Gray’s “Elegy” are fine reading for older pupils; 
for more tender feelings, comprehensible to children, 
lullabies are good, such as Tennyson’s “ Sweet and 
Low.”’ For developing appreciation of the awe-inspir- 
ing there is nothing better than Moore’s lines quoted 
above. The point is, the children before reading good 
emotional literature should be put into the proper 
frame of mind and by practice should have their voices 
and their manner of reading adjusted to the spirit of 
the selection. 
Grasp of Thought. Emphasis. — For reading aloud 
effectively it is necessary not only to be in the proper 
psychic state and to have voice and manner properly 
adjusted, but there must also be an especially good grasp 
of the thought of the matter read. The salient words 
must be picked out for emphasis. Given the proper 
feeling, emphasis is the key to good oral reading. 
A good exercise is to select passages and have the class 
decide by discussion and experiment what words should  
-P-A-G-E-60
54 What Children Study and Why 
receive first emphasis and what ones secondary. For ex- 
ample, in Macbeth’s lines: 
“‘Tf it were done when ’tis done, 
Then ’twere well it were done quickly.” 
should the first emphasis be on were or on done? 
Should secondary emphasis be on then or on quickly or 
both? A little such practice will make the pupils keen 
to ‘ see the point ” of what they are to read. 
But not merely words are salient; sometimes whole 
phrases or sentences even, in which no particular word 
needs to be emphasized, convey so much of the author’s 
thought that they should receive especial emphasis. 
For example, the sentence : 
“She looked down to blush and she looked up to sigh, 
With a smile on her lip and a tear in her eye.” — 
is divisible into four parts, each one of which is important, 
but no single word stands out enough from the others 
to require particular stress. It should be read evenly. 
Résumé. — For reading aloud the needs are first to 
get into the spirit of the piece, second to grasp its whole 
thought, third to select the proper words and phrases 
for emphasis. As a preparation for all of, these there 
should be drill in reading similar short sentences and care- 
ful study of the piece itself. 
Final Result. — The great final result of the reading 
lesson should be a love for good books. By every possible 
means appreciative taste should be developed. Then 
the children should be led from the reading book to the 
world of books. The single selection should create the 
desire to read the book from which it was taken. The
-P-A-G-E-61
Methods of Instruction 55 
public library should be the chief ally of the teacher of 
reading. ‘“‘ Reading” should always be reading. It 
should always be getting thought. Even with begin- 
ners such methods should be employed as will focus 
attention on the thought. 
The reading lesson should be the key to unlock to the 
children a t-easure. It should always be a joy, never 
a task.

  CHAPTER IV 
EnciisH LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION 
LANGUAGE is the fundamental, the universal art. It 
is not only necessary for the efficient communication of 
ideas among men, it is essential to thought itself in all 
its higher or human phases. Without it, apparently, 
we could do no thinking except such crude and rudi- 
mentary thinking as is possible to beasts. This is the 
state of deaf mutes before they have been taught to 
recognize and use words through some other medium 
than speech. 
Language used effectively by Illiterate. — Yet practi- 
cal instruction in the use of language, until late, had no 
definite place in the curricula of elementary schools. 
One reason for this condition is doubtless to be found 
in the very universality of the art. In spite of Dogberry, 
reading and writing are necessarily school subjects. 
They are to be taught by special organized effort and 
with the use of books. Whereas language everybody 
uses. It is acquired in infancy, and without any special 
instruction, from association and by imitation. When a 
child first comes to school he has a vocabulary adequate to 
his needs and can use it effectively; and all through life, 
whether literate or illiterate, his use of language, de- 
veloped from practical experience, is quite sure to be 
adequate to his practical, fundamental needs. 
So that, apparently, language instruction, instead of 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
    English Language Instruction 7) 
complaining at its long exclusion from the elementary 
school, must justify its plea for admission. The history 
of language instruction in elementary schools is sug- 
gestive and explains many things. 
Growth of the Curriculum. — Like the medieval school, 
the early American school had its trivium and its quad- 
rivium.. The former comprised the ‘three R’s, ” 
regarded as the fundamental arts, and constituted the 
entire curriculum for the younger pupil. The quadrivium 
for the older pupils at first merely added, to the trivium, 
grammar. 
The Dominance of Grammar.— Grammar was the 
characteristic and conspicuous study of the higher 
schools. It gave its name to them, and this name is still 
retained for the higher grades of the common school. It 
dominated the schools, not only in subject matter, but 
in method. For in the “good old days” grammar was 
Grammar, the scientific study of desiccated language. 
At first it was chiefly Latin grammar; and the English 
grammars which followed, and indeed many of those 
that still persist, were modeled after the Latin grammar, 
in spite of the differences of the two languages in spirit, 
in genius, and in the order of presenting thought. 
Grammar a Barren Subject. — But never, in either 
Latin or English, did it descend to so frivolous a con- 
sideration as either the practical art of effective expression 
or the true comprehension of literature. The medieval 
trivium was richer, barren as it was to serve as the sole 
subject of study, for it included with grammar both logic 
and rhetoric, the science of thought and the art of expres- 
sion. But our grammar stood sole and lonely. Not until - 
late in the last century did even the colleges treat rhetoric 
    
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 What Children Study and Why 
as worthy of serious consideration, while in many ele- 
mentary schools even now language instruction consists 
of a course of predigested grammar. For grammar 
rapidly forced itself into the elementary curriculum. It 
was the only answer suggested to the demand for in- 
struction in the mother tongue. The mistake was 
natural enough. It is the same mistake that was made 
at first in regard to the study of the phenomena and 
laws of nature. It was basing the instruction of young 
children upon logic rather than upon psychology, upon 
the nature of the subject studied more than upon the 
nature of the children. 
Language and Grammar Differentiated.— Therefore, 
in our discussion of instruction in the English language, 
it is necessary to differentiate carefully its two chief 
phases, what we commonly call “language lessons ” 
and “ grammar.”’ Both are important subjects, essential 
to anything approaching a “ good education.” But 
they are not the same subject, and their confusion has 
vitiated much of the instruction in language given in the 
elementary schools. 
The two subjects differ both in nature and in aim. 
In its nature, language is an art, the art of expressing 
thoughts in words. Grammar is a science, a statement 
of the laws according to which speech is organized. In 
aim, the language lesson seeks to give the student posses- 
sion of the art, to enable him to express his thoughts in 
words, effectively and elegantly. The aim of the gram- 
mar lesson, on the contrary, is not to cultivate effective 
expression, but to acquaint the student with the laws 
of speech; to make him critical of his own speech and 
that of others. 
¥ 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  English Language Instruction 59 
However, though the two subjects differ so widely, 
they have very intimate relations. Grammar includes 
the body of classified knowledge pertaining to the laws 
of speech. Obviously, the possession of this knowledge 
will furnish a criterion of exact and correct expression. 
A genuine art of speech must rest back upon known laws. 
In other words, grammar, the science, is the basis of 
rhetoric, the art. But a knowledge of the science does 
not convey skill in the art. There is a vast difference 
between the establishment of an art on the sure founda- 
tions of laws, or even the use of such laws by a mature 
and competent artist, and its practice in elementary 
forms. A child does not need to understand the physi- 
cal laws of sound and harmony before he can be taught 
to sing in time and in harmony. Neither does he need 
to know the laws of grammar before he can be taught to 
speak correctly. 
Justification of Language Lesson. — This leads us 
to the consideration of the “language lesson,” its 
justification, its purpose, and its method. Why are lan- 
guage lessons justifiable in elementary schools? If every- 
body without being taught uses language with reasonable 
effectiveness, why take time in school to teach it? 
Social Values. — First. There are certain conventions 
of literary art which cannot be acquired without instruc- 
tion. While conformity to these conventions is not 
absolutely necessary to the effective communication of 
thought upon the simple and more practical relations 
of life, failure to conform stamps one as uncultivated 
and injuriously affects one’s standing among his fel- 
lows. This may not seem the highest reason, but it is 
certainly sufficient to justify instruction in the art.
-P-A-G-E-66
  60 What Children Study and Why 
Conventionally correct speech and conventionally cor- 
rect manners, while not so important as unmistakable 
clearness of expression and genuine kindliness of spirit, 
are still the proper media for these higher qualities. 
More than any other superficial arts they smooth the 
way through the world. The excellent Maine sea captain 
who wrote of himself and his companion, “ Me and 
William’s gittin’ along fine,” expressed himself with 
perfect clearness and adequacy, yet his form of expres- 
sion left something to be desired as a qualification for 
admission to a salon. 
Letter Writing. — Second. This phase of the subject 
has a very “ practical” aspect. Letter writing, one of 
the most important branches of literary art, is very 
dependent upon conventional forms and the use of words 
with exact nicety. Modern business communications 
are, more often than not, in the form of letters. The 
ability to write letters in correct form, in “ good English,” 
saying exactly what one wants to say, is an absolutely in- 
dispensable part of the modern business man’s equipment. 
Necessary to High Thinking. — Third. The higher 
thoughts and the finer phases of thought cannot be ex- 
pressed at all through the crude homespun language of 
the unlettered. Paucity of language prevents the think- 
ing of high thoughts or of making those delicate analyses 
of thought that add incalculably to the joy and the 
fullness of life. 
Aids the Comprehension of Literature.— Fourth. Lan- 
guage training not only makes possible the expression, 
and hence the thinking, of high thoughts, it also makes 
possible the comprehension and appreciation of the best 
in literature, which is unseen by the untrained eye. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
    English Language Instruction 61 
Acquisition of Good Habits. — Fifth. The great 
argument for instruction in the art of language is the 
early acquisition of habit and its fixity when once ac- 
quired. The correct use of language is the result, not of 
knowledge, but of habit. A teacher who was overheard 
saying to her class, “ Ain’t that all the further we took? ” 
when called to account, said, amid her tears, ‘ Why, 
I knew better.” I replied, ‘‘ Yes, doubtless you could 
have parsed your own blunder.”’ And she could. It 
was the result, not of ignorance, but of habit, sheer habit, 
acquired in the uncultivated home. The greater number 
of homes are uncultivated. If the schools are to remedy 
the defects of the home, and equip the children with 
correct habits of speech, they cannot catch them too early. 
Instruction must be definite and thorough and of the 
right sort, from the earliest primary grades. 
Objects of Instruction. — Let us consider now the 
aims of the language lesson. The first great aim of 
language instruction in the earlier years of school is to 
train the children to facility, accuracy, forcefulness, and 
elegance in their habitual use of English, both when 
speaking and when writing. 
Doubtless most teachers will accept this statement, at 
least in theory. But, unfortunately, when they come 
to actual teaching, too often the chief effort is bent upon 
another aim altogether, namely, the teaching of the 
facts and principles of grammar. The homeopathic dose 
of calomel is a dose of calomel still, though disguised 
and diluted. The grammar notion is so firmly fixed 
in the minds of teachers, that it is well-nigh impossible 
to eradicate it, even from teaching that is ostensibly 
for a wholly different purpose. And the authorities 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 What Children Study and Why 
giving tests, no matter how earnestly they may have 
urged upon the teachers practical work in language, are 
almost sure to put the brunt of the examination upon 
grammar. 
Moreover, the authors of “ language books,” while in 
their prefaces insisting upon the paramountcy of practical 
language lessons, in the books themselves too frequently 
place the emphasis upon grammar, and to such an extent 
that the teachers are sure to feel the necessity of doing 
likewise. For example, several of these books define the 
sentence respectively on pages 7, 3, 2, 3,5. This is done 
manifestly under the notion that before using an instru- 
ment of communication, or calling its name, it is necessary 
to be able to define it in words; which is as sensible as 
not to allow a child to name or play with a doll until 
he can define it in “‘ good set terms,” or to ride on or 
mention a horse until, like Bitzer, he can give a definition 
of it. Some authors, in a vain endeavor to ‘“ temper 
the wind to the shorn lamb,” resort to simplified defi- 
nitions which are inaccurate and misleading — Bowd- 
lerized grammar. Witness, from one modern book: 
“ A group of words which (sic) tells one’s thoughts is 
called a sentence.” 
Essential Evils of Grammar Dominance. — These are 
but illustrations of the foes that lie in wait to deceive 
and mislead the teachers who would teach language really 
and vitally. They are to be criticized, not chiefly be- 
cause of the futility or even the misleading nature of the 
instruction resulting, but because of the influence of this 
early technical teaching on the spirit and method of all 
the work. ‘“ The trail of the serpent is over it all.” 
The efforts of teacher and class alike are inevitably
-P-A-G-E-69
  
English Language Instruction 63 
diverted from the real object of the instruction to a 
secondary function. Like the rudimentary tail, the 
notion persists that to be able to recite the rules and 
definitions of grammar is a prerequisite to the utterance 
of correct speech. The battle of psychology against 
logic in the teaching of children is a long and hard one, 
and the favorite battle ground is the field of language. 
Place of Grammar.— The time comes, of course, 
when the teaching of grammar is a legitimate aim. 
Even in the elementary grades, when the function of a 
word as such is spoken of, the correct name of the word 
is better than a nickname. A nameisa handle, and when 
it can be used with reasonable accuracy, it is preferable 
to a substitute. It is well enough for a child to call 
a dog bowwow until the function has become associated 
in the infant mind with its source. Then the bowwow 
should become the dog. So “ name-word”’ very early 
gives place to “noun.” But this is at most incidental. 
Grammar is properly a high school study, though, as 
many never reach the high school, it may without injury, 
in a simple form, enter into the higher grades of the ele- 
mentary school. Yet even then it must not be allowed 
to interfere with the constructive work of the language 
lesson. 
Necessity of Vital Interest. — The fundamental general 
aim of all class exercises is to arouse and maintain a vital 
interest in the subject pursued. Such interest on the 
part of young children demands the free, glad exercise 
of natural powers, aching for exercise. Free and joyful 
expression of himself is the manifest first necessary aim 
in a child’s education, an aim that precedes and makes 
possible higher disciplinary aims. For young children 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  64 What Children Study and Why 
in a language class, formal grammar, even in the shape 
of mere definitions before they can possibly be developed 
intelligently out of experience, dams the stream of interest 
and perverts the aim of instruction. 
Training to Think. — A second aim of the language 
lesson is to train children to think. Thinking is organiz- 
ing ideas into definite comprehensible wholes, technically 
known as sentences. The relations of thinking and ex- 
pressing thoughts are reciprocal. No clear expression is 
possible unless the thought to be expressed is‘clear. On 
the other hand, the effort to organize ideas for expression 
clarifies them in the mind. Hence a good language 
lesson is training in thinking. 
Appreciation of Literature. — A third specific aim of the 
language lesson is the appreciation of literary art. This 
aim is not chiefly critical, in the offensive sense. In- 
deed, with young children such critical study should be 
wholly obscured. But, through the language lesson, as 
well as through the reading lesson, children should learn 
to see the beauties of good literature. In the lowest 
grades, this can be little more than “ I like ” or “ I don’t 
like,” but gradually the reasons may be brought out. 
And in the grammar grades a considerable degree of well- 
founded taste may be developed. 
It must be remembered that the vast majority of pupils 
never go beyond the grammar school; and whatever of 
taste they acquire must be developed early. Especially 
by correlating language study with the reading lesson, 
enough may be accomplished to direct in great measure 
the reading of children after leaving school. 
Enriching Vocabulary. — A fourth aim of the language 
lesson, which is really a corollary of the other two, is to
-P-A-G-E-71
  English Language Instruction 65 
enrich the pupils’ vocabulary and to enable them to 
use words in their exact meanings. The average vocabu- 
lary is pitifully small. By large numbers of fairly 
intelligent people two or three adjectives are used to 
indicate nearly all qualities. ‘‘ Lovely” and “ horrid ” 
cover a multitude of characteristics. Punch has a picture 
of a French boy asking an English boy what the three r’s 
are. After some hesitation the answer is given, “‘ rum, 
rippin’, and rotten,” adjectives that are supposed to 
describe all things worthy of description by an English 
schoolboy. 
I was visiting the Grand Canyon of the Colorado in 
Arizona. A lady, after gazing long at the stupendous, 
awe-inspiring panorama, turned to a companion and said, 
“Tsn’t it just the cutest thing you ever saw in your life? ” 
To remove this poverty of words to express varying 
ideas should be one aim of.the language lesson. Both 
through the appreciative study of literature and through 
much attention to the choice of suitable words by the 
children in expressing their own ideas, it should be im- 
pressed upon them that the right word tells the truth, the 
wrong word does not. 
If all teachers of the subject would differentiate be- 
tween the “ language lesson ” and the “‘ grammar lesson,” 
and would expend their efforts in the former toward se- 
curing correct habits of speech, rather than verbal 
statements of laws uncomprehended by the children, it 
would mark a great advance over prevailing conditions. 
But before this may be hoped for those in authority must 
fix, as the criterion of the teacher’s work in language, 
correct speech, oral and written, by the children, rather 
than statements about it.
-P-A-G-E-72
  CHAPTER V 
LancuacE Instruction MEtTHops 
How Children learn Language. — How does a child 
naturally learn to use language? At first altogether, and 
always chiefly, by sheer imitation. There is no other way 
for him. One’s vocabulary depends upon memory. 
The art of language consists in using the remembered 
vocabulary in effective combinations, and such combina- 
tions are for the most part imitations. Only at rare 
intervals is an original form of expression produced. 
In teaching language the two inseparable and essential 
elements are the language of others — conversation-and 
literature — to supply vocabulary and model forms in 
great variety, and much practice in the use of language, 
to reduce conscious imitation to unconscious imitation 
or habit, to make the vocabulary learned a permanent 
possession through use, and to give facility and personal 
character, — style, — to the form of expression employed. 
Coincidently with observation and expression, and as 
a further aid in the acquirement of language power and 
of the art of expression, comes a knowledge of certain 
fixed conventions of general acceptance. These are the 
“rules ” of grammar and of rhetoric. 
In the earlier stages of a child’s learning language, rules 
are of little consequence. With advancing maturity and 
logical power they become increasingly important, 
clinching and putting into convenient and condensed 
66 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Language Instruction Methods 67 
form the principles and language customs that have 
already been demonstrated to the learner and imitated 
by him. Only when they record experience are these 
rules of value—a fact that bears directly on the 
method of teaching. 
Good Models Essential. — The first essentials, then, 
in teaching language to children are good models to 
imitate and good thought to express, with the desire to 
express it. 
Before a child comes to school, his models are chiefly 
the oral speech of family and of playmates. In some 
cases to these have been added stories told to the children 
and learned by them, which have greatly enlarged their 
vocabulary. It follows that among the members of any 
class entering school there are wide differences of vocabu- 
lary, both in extent and in character, and also in habits 
of speech. 
During the first two or three years of the school life 
the teaching of language is mainly incidental, and, per- 
haps for this very reason, especially effective. Thesources 
of new vocabulary are vast, all the new subjects of the 
school course and the conversation of teachers and fellow 
pupils about these subjects, — nature study, number, 
writing, and especially reading, through which the chil- 
dren receive their conscious introduction to the vocabu- 
lary and style of literature. Besides, the modern primary 
school offers and encourages an abundance of oral ex- 
pression on many subjects, and this expression is free, 
with the mind fixed on the thought and on the expression 
merely as to its adequacy, unvexed by the disturbing 
suggestion that “language” is being studied and un- 
hampered by fear of interrupting correction. Such 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
eer ee Fearn eee Treen ame ETE: Ct RENTER SEE 
68 What Children Study and Why 
experiences develop language power amazingly, so as 
often to give rise to questions as to the reason. We 
are apt to forget that power in language, as in all else, 
is a by-product. 
Decline in Language Power. — In the third or fourth 
grade, usually, the formal language lesson is introduced, 
commonly witha book. Then too often begins the de- 
cline. Language power seems to be palsied. . In spite 
of liberal doses of grammar, both raw and predigested, 
free and effective speech gradually disappears from the 
schoolroom, being relegated to the home, the playground, 
and the street, where freedom is not always tempered with 
continence, or adorned with art. Why is it? Let me 
risk wearying the reader with a brief criticism of the usual 
formal language lesson, drawn from the average language 
book. 
Bad Lessons. — First comes a definition, frequently 
badly expressed, and sometimes incorrect, in a vain 
attempt to make plain to children what is beyond them, 
by expressing it in inferior English —a very common 
error, whether “ baby talk ” or grammar. For example, 
— “A tongue sound used to indicate an object or an idea 
is called a word,” or this,—“‘ Mental pictures are for 
short called ideas.” 
The words of the definition having been committed to 
memory, then comes a copying exercise “ to fix them.” 
Then follows an exercise in filling blanks, as (from one 
book) ‘ The song is sweeter than the ——”’; or (from 
another book) “A pin a head but —— no hair.” 
Even worse than these are the formal grammar lessons in 
primary grades. 
Thought, freedom, fluency, appropriateness, those un-   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  Language Instruction Methods 69 
failing characteristics of untrammeled expression, are 
all absent. Language has become a mere task, — to 
“ illustrate ”’ something, to explain a rule or a definition. 
Hence it is no wonder that power is lost, for power comes 
only through exercise, and power in language is the result 
of the effective expression of thought. 
Training to Think. — Since teaching language is teach- 
ing thinking, — organizing ideas and indicating their rela- 
tions,— the necessary order of instruction is somewhat as 
follows: First, the presentation of good models. Second, 
stimulating thought that demands expression. Third, 
clarifying and organizing the thought. Fourth, securing 
free and abundant expression which, largely uncon- 
sciously, follows the models in vocabulary and style. 
Fifth, giving such definite instruction in regard to the 
conventions of speech — the rules of grammar and of 
rhetoric — as will enable the learner to judge of the 
correctness of his expression, putting his practical knowl- 
edge, his observed facts, into technical form convenient 
for memorizing. Sixth, developing and enlarging the 
child’s vocabulary. Let us briefly consider these six 
essentials of method. 
Sources of Models. — First. The models that the 
teacher can use are his own speech and that of the other 
pupils in school in so far as he can control it, and good 
literature. 
As to the first, the teacher cannot be too careful. 
Children are so sure to imitate both consciously and un- 
consciously that a single incorrect expression used before 
a class is likely to form a part of the vocabulary of all 
the children and to spread even into the homes. 
The chief reliance for models of form and of vocabu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 What Children Study and Why 
lary is literature, found either in books read by the chil- 
dren or in stories told to them; and it must be inter- 
esting literature. It is not enough to give children 
disconnected sentences illustrating a “point,” or to require 
’ them to repeat correct forms many times. Mere forced 
reiteration does not produce habit. There must be 
interest in the thing repeated, to give effect to the repeti- 
tion. An interesting story in which a form that it is 
desired to teach occurs repeatedly is vastly more effective 
in impressing the form than the mere recital of the form 
itself an indefinite number of times. The child who 
first listens wide-eyed to the story of the “‘ Three Goats 
Bruit,” and then tells it, using repeatedly, as he will, 
the form “ It is I,” builds a barrier against “ It is me” 
many times more effective than if he were to recite or to 
write, “It is I,” without interesting association any 
number of times. Hence, model passages, drawn from 
literature and illustrating the correct use of the forms 
that must be employed, should be studied in connection 
with the free expression, preferably beforehand, to lay 
a metaphysical foundation, and to suggest vocabulary 
and style. 
Caution. — A caution is needed here. The written 
reproduction of choice literature, excepting very rarely 
for the sake of impressing some specified form, is vicious, 
and its most vicious phase is the paraphrasing of poems. 
Material for Thought. — Second. The language lesson 
should present to the children a large amount of appro- 
priate thought-compelling material of such a nature that 
they will be moved to think and will desire to express 
their thoughts. The subject matter must appeal to the 
children as of consequence. The larger interest in the
-P-A-G-E-77
Language Instruction Methods 71 
thought will carry the smaller interest in the form. The 
material that should be drawn upon for the language 
lesson includes the best in the child’s world, and the most 
natural; his home life, his games and occupations, his 
school life, especially the content subjects of his daily 
work—literature, history, nature. These are natural and 
valuable subjects of thought upon which children can 
easily be induced to express themselves freely, if not too 
much hampered by fear of interrupting corrections. 
Continued Discourse. — Excepting occasionally and 
for very specific purposes, the language expression should 
be in full and continuous discourse and not in mere 
illustrative sentences; that is, it should be natural, like 
expression when not in the language class. 
Oral Expression. — The first expression usually should 
be oral. It is easier to correct and it is of more conse- 
quence to the average person. 
Clear Thinking. — Third. Before thought can be 
expressed effectively, it must be conceived clearly. 
Teachers sometimes wonder at their failure to secure 
good English expression, and pound away on the forms 
and the rules and definitions, or even encourage much 
talking without securing the desired results, because they 
have ignored the essential thing, the thought itself. In 
many instances much time must be given to clarifying 
and organizing thought before good expression is pos- 
sible. 
Sentence and Paragraph.— The sentence and the 
paragraph are the elementary bases of the expression of 
organized thought, — the sentence of the single thought 
and the paragraph of the group of closely related thoughts. 
Hence in the earlier stages, and indeed in all stages of
-P-A-G-E-78
    
Ge What Children Study and Why 
language instruction, much attention should be given 
to the construction of clear-cut sentences and para- 
graphs. 
The Sentence. — What is a sentence? An idea is the 
primary unit of thought. A thought is the union of at 
least two ideas in an assertion, a question or a command. 
Its essential feature is predication. A sentence is cor- 
rectly defined as “‘ the expression of a thought in words.” 
But this definition is not for young children. Besides its 
logical definition, the sentence has also its functional 
r “ working ” definition. The first knowledge of any- 
thing that comes to a child is always a working knowl- 
edge and comes through observation and experience. 
The logical definition arrives very late, if at all. Most 
of us have a competent working knowledge of many things 
that we cannot define. What we first observe are ap- 
pearance and function. 
Children learn sentences in just this way. They ob- 
serve the appearance. Each sentence stands by itself 
on a printed page, clearly separated from every other 
sentence. Its beginning and its end are clearly shown, 
the beginning by a capital letter and the end by an easily 
recognized mark. With a very little drill the children 
can quickly learn to divide a page-into sentences from 
appearance alone. 
Then each sentence does something, it has a function. 
It asserts, it asks, or it commands. This is a more 
reliable criterion than appearance. Together they are 
nearly infallible. At least they are sufficiently exact for 
the uses of any child in a primary school. 
To tell a child of the third or fourth grade that a sen- 
tence is the complete expression of a thought does not
-P-A-G-E-79
  Language Instruction Methods 73 
add to his knowledge of a sentence. It rather tends to 
confuse him, because he is too immature to grasp the 
metaphysical nature of a thought. And even if he were 
to grasp it, the knowledge would scarcely aid him in 
comprehending what he reads or in expressing his own 
thoughts. Wha. he needs is a working knowledge, 
knowledge of appearance and function. So there should 
be much drill in recognizing sentences from these evi- 
dences. Many sentences of each of the three functional 
classes should be presented for selection on both grounds. 
Then the child should make many sentences of all three 
kinds. His first formal written work should be in ex- 
pression of his own thought on some topic of interest to 
him, the technical requirement being that he make his 
sentences complete. 
The Paragraph. — The study of the paragraph natu- 
rally follows that of the sentence. The paragraph is the 
secondary unit of organized language. The sentence is 
a union of ideas; the paragraph, of thoughts. 
The first step is the observation of some selection 
divided into paragraphs, accompanied by a discussion 
of the reasons for such division. 
This should be followed by a grouping of sentences into 
paragraphs. For example: The class talk about some 
interesting topic quite freely, while the teacher writes on 
the blackboard the sentences given by different pupils. 
Then the class discuss the sentences and decide how they 
should be grouped. 
Much practice both in observation and in production 
will make a class quite expert in the use of both para- 
graphs and sentences without any metaphysical defini- 
tions whatever, and in the primary grades no attempt
-P-A-G-E-80
      74 What 
at definition should be made, except by appearance 
and function. 
Need of Progression. — Necessarily with growing 
power the treatment of these units becomes more and 
more systematic and logical. One of the serious defects 
of many language books is the lack of progression. 
The last part is on the same plane of difficulty as the first. 
The only progress clearly sought for is in the knowledge 
of the merely mechanical or technical requirements of 
written composition. Progressive power to think clearly 
and to organize thought is not developed. And yet this 
is one of the most important functions of the language 
lesson. 
Complete Discourse. — From the paragraph easy steps 
should lead to the larger unit, the whole discourse. First 
should come the study of the literary model, the analysis 
and representation in outline of some selection readily 
grasped by the pupils. After considerable practice 
in this exercise the construction of a story or a descrip- 
tion from an outline given on a topic similar to the one 
studied follows naturally. This should be followed by 
the making of original outlines and the writing of stories 
or other literary forms from them. With the younger 
children it is well to make the first studies in codperation 
with the teacher, upon the blackboard. Later, individ- 
ual productions should be made. 
Clarifying Thought. — Many devices might be men- 
tioned as helpful in clarifying thought for writing. The 
observation of nature and the making of notes from time 
to time, followed by a careful coérdination and arrange- 
ment of parts, and finally a full written account of what 
was observed, is an excellent exercise. Another is the hildren Study and Why      
-P-A-G-E-81
  Language Instruction Methods 75 
collection, by the class in coéperation, of facts about some 
topic in geography or history or literature, combining 
these into a series of carefully edited chapters, making 
a coéperative book. 
Motor Activities. — One of the very best means avail- 
able to all for clarifying thought is through some form 
of manual expression, utilizing the motor activities. This, 
truth is universally recognized in schools for the feeble- 
minded, where the main reliance for awakening dormant 
minds is the employment of the muscular sense. It is 
also especially valuable with foreigners, to whom fre- 
quently the thing made by hand gives the first dawning 
of comprehension. Modeling in clay, picturing with 
pencil or brush, representing by cutting from paper with 
scissors, constructing with carpenters’ tools, so clarify im- 
pression that clear expression follows readily. When a 
child has made a thing, he knows it. When he knows it 
thoroughly, he can usually tell about it. The so-called 
“ sand table,’’.a long table on which may be represented 
in various media continued stories, or entire histori- 
cal and geographical scenes, has cleared the minds and 
loosened the tongues of hundreds of children. 
There are many other devices, but it is not my purpose 
to treat of devices. Those I have given are merely 
typical and suggestive of the necessity of developing 
good thinking through the language lesson. 
Free Expression. — Fourth. Some ways of stimulat- 
ing free expression have already been indicated. When 
interest has been aroused and a desire for expression 
created, let the expression come. Guideit. See that it 
is profitable, but do not check it. The art is never 
learned but by use. The flow should be directed into
-P-A-G-E-82
  76 What Children Study and Why 
the proper channel, but if there is no flow, of what use 
is the channel? In all grades much oral speech should 
be encouraged, both because of its own supreme impor- 
tance and as a preparation for the written work. 
Place of Rules. — Fifth. Instruction in technic and in 
conventional forms should be given as needed, after free 
expression has been secured and after some literary in- 
terest and appreciation have been developed, not before. 
Throughout the elementary. grades such instruction 
should be given only as it is of manifest service in express- 
ing thought or in appreciating thought as expressed by 
others. It should be incidental, not, however, accidental. 
It should be systematic and thorough. It should include 
all the mechanical rules of correct form, — punctuation, 
the use of capitals, the correct use of many word forms, 
regular and irregular, often misused, the meanings of 
words, and especially the conventional forms of letter 
writing. To the average citizen letter writing is the 
only literary exercise that is at all practical. Most 
people use no other. Hence it should be very carefully 
and well taught, not in a few lessons ‘‘ bunched ” in a 
single chapter of a language book, but continually, 
through practice under instruction. The instruction 
should include, not only the correct forms of opening, 
closing, and the like, but should suggest what to say in 
various kinds of letters. 
Developing Vocabulary. — Sixth. Making a child’s 
vocabulary fuller and more exact is a somewhat difficult 
task. 
First, the children should be interested in words. They 
should be led to see the varying shades of truthfulness 
in words used to convey ideas. That is not difficult, for
-P-A-G-E-83
  Language Instruction Methods ae, 
a word is a very vital thing, and if presented rightly, is 
as interesting as a bird or a pebble. The chief source 
of a vocabulary that marks the user as cultivated is 
literature. Much reading of good literature necessarily 
gives the knowledge of a choice and varied vocabulary. 
Professor Percival Chubb, in his excellent book, ‘‘ The 
Teaching of English,” observes that through the use of 
standard folk lore and of rhymes such as those of ‘““Mother 
Goose” even little children are made familiar with 
literary language. Hence children’s minds should be 
steeped in these old tales and verses, that they may start 
with more than the common colloquial vocabulary. 
Telling good standard stories to children, to be retold 
by them, is one of the best exercises for developing a good 
vocabulary. This is especially valuable for young chil- 
dren whose reading is necessarily very limited. In tell- 
ing such stories great care should be taken to use the 
literary language in which they are dressed. Children 
in retelling are sure to repeat these literary words. 
With young children, and with foreigners especially, 
a very good plan is to write the unusual words on the 
blackboard, that they may appeal to the eye and thus 
aid the memory. Children will unconsciously employ 
them in the right places. The teacher telling the story, 
without interrupting the narrative or saying anything 
about the words, writes on the board a few such words, 
as she uses them. As the story is told repeatedly more 
words may be added. It will be ‘found that the chil- 
dren will use this visible vocabulary with surprising 
accuracy. 
For example, suppose the story to be the following 
old Arabian fable: 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
        What Children Study and Why 
  78 
A thoughtful fisherman who had caught a very little 
fish was putting it into his basket. 
“Oh, fisherman,” said the little fish, “I entreat you 
to restore me to my house in the water; I am so little 
that I shall scarcely be a bite for you. When I grow 
larger, I shall make you a feast.” 
“ True,” said the wise fisherman, “but where shall I 
find you when you have grown larger? ” 
The teacher in telling this story for the first time might 
write on the blackboard such words as thoughtful, fisher- 
man, entreat, home, scarcely. At a second telling she 
might add feast, wise, grown, restore, larger. These words 
would be sure to be used by the children, not only in 
retelling the story, but also asa part of their permanent 
vocabulary. 
In the higher grades especially, it is well to call atten- 
tion to the careful and exact use of words by some skill- 
ful author. How does he produce the effect that they 
admire? What would be the effect of substituting 
other words? Let them try it. For example, take this 
selection from Henry W. Grady: 
“Let me picture to you the footsore Confederate 
soldier, as buttoning in his faded gray jacket, the parole 
which was to bear testimony of his fidelity and faith, 
he turned his face southward from Appomattox in April, 
1865. Think of him as, ragged, half-starved, heavy- 
hearted, enfeebled by want and wounds, having fought to 
exhaustion, he surrenders his gun, wrings the hands of 
his comrades in silence, and, lifting his tear-stained and 
pallid face for the last time to the graves that dot old 
Virginia’s hills, pulls his gray cap over his brow, and 
begins the slow and painful journey.”   
-P-A-G-E-85
  Language Instruction Methods 79 
Have the children study the following words to see 
just what each adds to the picture: 
footsore faded fidelity southward 
ragged half-starved enfeebled exhaustion 
surrenders wrings tear-stained graves 
old pulls slow painful 
Then let them try to substitute some other word for 
each of these and judge the effect. 
The older pupils also may profitably spend considerable 
time in the study of synonyms. The spelling book fre- 
quently gives lists. Especially should the children in 
all grades be stimulated to give particular care to the 
choice of the best word in each case to express exactly 
what is meant. It should become a matter of rivalry 
and pride. It may even be developed into a game. 
“ Who can find the largest number of words that express 
the idea of strength? What are their differences of 
meaning? Show these by use in sentences.” 
Neglect in Higher Grades. — When formal grammar 
is taken up in the higher grades, it is quite too common to 
allow constructive language work to take a minor place. 
This is a sad mistake. Even in the higher grades it is 
of vastly greater consequence that the children acquire 
increasing power to use language well than that they 
learn the rules of grammar. Especial care should be 
exercised here to see that the grammar does not crowd 
out the language lesson. New and interesting exercises 
should be introduced, suited to sustain the attention of 
older children, who should be encouraged to write in 
various styles, in imitation of admired authors, and upon 
various topics.
-P-A-G-E-86
    80 What Children Study and Why 
Correlations Needed. — The language exercise should 
be closely correlated with history, geography, nature 
‘study, and especially literature. Much of this correla- 
tion necessarily will be incidental, particularly in oral 
recitations. 
All Written Work the Best Possible. — All written 
lessons should be in the best English that the students 
can command. This should be a rigid requirement. 
The pupils should understand that a paper sloven in 
style, careless or incorrect in vocabulary, will not be 
accepted. This requirement strictly enforced will do 
more to develop the habit of using good English than 
any number of formal compositions. These may not be 
neglected, however. They are very necessary, but in 
life out of school one’s English is judged by his use of 
language in expressing his thoughts upon all subjects in 
conversation and in letters. Very few indeed ever have 
occasion to attempt strictly literary composition. This 
fact should be a guide to the teacher. 
Every Lesson a Language Lesson. — All teachers are 
of necessity teachers of language and all lessons should 
be language lessons. Indeed, every lesson is a lesson in 
language, good or bad, for it is by expressing, not certain 
selected thoughts, but all thoughts, that habits of speech 
are formed. 
Caution. — A caution, however, is needed here. Lan- 
guage is used in expressing thought. In our eagerness 
to secure correct expression, we must not ignore the 
thought; clear thinking must precede clear, fluent ex- 
pression. In their anxiety to correct error, teachers 
sometimes so annoy and interrupt children as to stop 
the thinking and thus cut off the means of instruction.
-P-A-G-E-87
  Language Instruction Methods 81 
The correction, if needed, should not break into the 
current of thought, but should come after the statement 
has been completed. 
' Résumé. — By the employment of good models of oral 
speech and literary composition, by stimulating thought 
that demands expression, by training to lucid and logi- 
cal thinking as the basis of lucid and logical expression, 
by securing abundant and free expression, both oral and 
written, and by teaching inductively the necessary prin- 
ciples and laws of correct expression, it is possible to 
secure for most children a fair degree of the inestimable 
power, fluently, clearly, effectively, and even elegantly 
to express their thoughts.

CHAPTER VI 
ENGLISH GRAMMAR 
GRAMMAR treats of the science of language. It con- 
sists in a properly classified statement of the rules that 
govern correct speech and of the facts and principles 
underlying these rules. 
The Laws of Speech. — The “laws of speech”? in their 
origin differ wholly from the “ laws of nature,” which are 
a statement of the mode of action of natural forces and are 
inherent in nature, and hence inviolable and unchange- 
able. They differ also from statute laws, which are 
enactments made by legally constituted authorities for 
the control of the conduct of those lawfully subject to 
them, and hence are arbitrary rather than natural, are not 
inviolable, but may be changed by the proper authorities. 
The laws of grammar are arbitrary rather than natural, 
but they are not enacted by any legally constituted au- 
thority. They are the result of convention and are 
drawn from the usage of “‘ standard writers,” which has 
been generally accepted as correct. Hence they are not 
only violable, but are in many instances attended with 
a degree of uncertainty, giving rise to differences of 
opinion as to what is correct usage. Moreover, they are 
subject to material change from time to time. For 
example, Shakespeare and the Bible present many in- 
stances of the double negative, in modern grammars 
universally pronounced incorrect.

-P-A-G-E-89
  
English Grammar 83 
It is sometimes said that we have no English grammar. 
This, though an extreme statement, has a certain basis 
of fact. Along the old lines our grammar has been re- 
duced pretty nearly to the minimum. The bulk of 
our modern grammar is to a considerable degree tradi- 
tional and artificial. It is made up of more or less vain 
attempts to make it appear that the simpler present-day 
forms are to be treated like the complex forms they have 
displaced. The great modern changes in our language 
are in the line of simplicity and economy. Inflections 
have well nigh disappeared and easier means of express- 
ing variations of relation have succeeded them. 
For the six cases of the Latin and the five of the Greek, 
to show the relations of nouns, we have two forms only. 
Instead of the three inflectional voices of the Greek verb, 
ours has none, the relations formerly so indicated being 
expressed wholly by the use of additional words. Of the 
six modes with inflectional forms of the Greek we have 
two, and when the fast-disappearing subjunctive sleeps 
with its fathers, we shall have none. 
Whether the verbal expressions made up of the stem 
word with prepositions or auxiliaries will permanently be 
classified under the old inflectional names, remains to be 
seen. Probably, as the present tendency is decidedly 
toward simplicity, they will gradually be dropped. In- 
deed this is to be hoped. I believe that such elimination 
would mean no loss whatever to the English language, 
or to the student, but on the contrary would set free an 
immense amount of energy now wasted in trying to fit ob- 
solete or obsolescent names to new and more virile forms. 
As a matter of curiosity let us see what inflectional 
forms remain to us. Of the regular verb there are these: 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
    
84 What Children Study and Why 
love, loves, loved, loving, — four. Of the irregular 
verb be: be, am, is, are, was, were, being, been, — 
eight, the largest number. 
Of the noun: boy, boy’s, boys, boys’, — four. 
Of the adjectives and adverbs, comparison only. 
What slight material is this for the building ofa gram- 
mar of the proportions of a Greek grammar, with its five 
cases of nouns in each of the three numbers, these multi- 
plied by three genders for adjectives; its three voices of 
verbs, each with its six moods consisting of six tenses of 
three numbers each and three persons to each number. 
Of course there were many repetitions among these forms, 
otherwise even the Greek mind would have staggered 
underneath the load. Theoretically it was necessary to 
have nine hundred and seventy-two inflectional forms of 
a regular Greek verb. 
Truly the power of tradition is mighty among us that 
we still keep above ground the ghosts of so many of these 
forms. Still for the present we must teach, and children 
must learn, the conventional forms and be thankful that 
they are no more numerous. 
Functions of Grammar. — To the trained adult mind 
the study of grammar has certain higher uses which may 
only be referred to here. Grammar bears a close rela- 
tion to both history and philosophy. The grammar of a 
people is an index to the mode of mental activity peculiar 
to that people, which is, naturally, largely responsible 
for its ideals, its philosophy, and its achievements. For 
example, the German retains many inflections that have 
been discarded by his livelier neighbors, the French and 
the English speaking races. This is in harmony with his 
natural conservatism, He indulges in long involved sen-
-P-A-G-E-91
  English Grammar 85 
tences with the key word left for the end, so that when, 
after a comfortable ambling through the intermediate 
words and phrases he at last utters it, he has the thought 
complete, well rounded, guarded before and after. His 
sentence is like himself, comfortable, leisurely, but logical 
and. complete. 
The Frenchman, on the contrary, rushes headlong to 
his verbal fate. Not seeing the end from the beginning, 
he utters the words that come to him, as fast as possible. 
When he reaches the end, he has said it all, it is true, 
but without the substantial, sure, and rounded com- 
fortableness of the German. For that very reason he is 
more brilliant, more surprising. He has no time in his 
verbal “ joy-riding” for inflections, so he has cast them 
nearly all away, and as he rushes on to an undetermined 
end he drops epigrams like fireworks to dazzle and delight 
us. His work and his sentence are expressions of himself. 
These are merely patent illustrations of the association 
of a people’s grammar with its psychology. 
Training in Logic. — But grammar has its own direct 
uses to the student advanced enough properly to pursue 
the subject. Chief among these is his training in logic. 
When properly studied, it leads to the analysis of thought 
itself. In this it goes far beyond the language lesson as 
described in the preceding chapter. In grammar, the 
sentence, which in the language lesson was recognized 
as a whole, by appearance and manifest function, is 
recognized by structure as well. The fallible judgment 
of the language lesson becomes infallible. The thought 
also, of which the sentence is the complete expression, 
is evidenced by structure. The beautiful and complete 
wedding of two ideas into a new unit, a thought, is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  86 What Children Study and Why 
revelation of perfect logic, of the greatest value to a matur- 
ing mind. This once grasped, his own speech rests upon 
a new and firm foundation of law. The vague gives place 
to the exact, and his growth in language power keeps pace 
with his natural growth of body and soul. 
“ Consider for a moment what grammar is. It is the 
most elementary part of logic. It is the beginning of the 
analysis of the thinking process. The principles and 
rules of grammar are the means by which the forms of 
language are made to correspond with the universal 
forms of thought. The distinctions between the various 
parts of speech, between the cases of nouns, the moods 
and tenses of verbs, the functions of participles, are dis- 
tinctions in thought, not merely in words. Single nouns 
and verbs express objects and events, many of which 
can be cognized by the senses; but the modes of putting 
nouns and verbs together express the relations of objects 
and events, which can be cognized only by the intellect ; 
and each different mode corresponds to a different re- 
lation. The structure of every sentence is a lesson in 
logic.”—Joun Stuart Mitt. . 
Training in Appreciation. — The study of grammar 
also opens the eyes of the student to many of the excel- 
lencies of admired authors. Through his knowledge 
of the structure of language and of its laws he is able to 
see to what extent and how the art of literary expression 
is based upon science. For example, style is often de- 
pendent upon an author’s habitual use of certain gram- 
matical forms. To Irving’s use of the long, loose, com- 
pound sentence is due, in part at least, the charming 
ease of his narrative; while Victor Hugo produced his 
peculiar, forceful staccato effect by employing succes-
-P-A-G-E-93
  
English Grammar 87 
sively short, almost sharp, simple sentences. Studying 
grammar from this point of view quickens the student’s 
literary appreciation and makes him a more intelligent 
reader. 
The teaching of grammar should make manifest these 
various functions of the subject, higher as well as lower, 
and should thus make it a broadening and enriching 
study, and not merely a series of exercises upon arbitrary 
or traditional conventionalities.
-P-A-G-E-94
    CHAPTER VII 
ENGLIsH GRAMMAR 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
Grammar for Children. —JIn discussing method in 
teaching grammar it is important to distinguish between 
methods profitable for adult minds and those suitable 
for the young and immature. Abstruse discussions of 
grammatical theory and the making of fine distinctions, 
especially of definition and nomenclature, are utterly 
futile in teaching children. Whether the word ‘“ when ” 
used to join a dependent clause to its principal clause is 
a conjunctive adverb or an adverbial conjunction is of 
no moment to a child. The important thing for him to 
know is function. “ When” thus used performs the 
office of a conjunction in that it joins clauses. It also 
imparts an adverbial sense to the dependent clause. 
The duality of function is all a child needs to know. 
Treats of Function.— A grammar for children, that 
is, for the grammar school, at first should treat chiefly 
of function. As children advance in maturity the study 
of structure should follow as explaining both the func- 
tions of words and of their various combinations and 
also the laws of grammar. 
Grammar is of necessity an abstract study. The 
thing studied, the word as a part of a sentence, is at 
least twice removed from the object or the idea that it 
88
-P-A-G-E-95
  English Grammar 89 
represents and which alone appeals naturally to a child. 
In the sentence, ‘‘ Reading maketh a full man,” reading 
is to be studied grammatically as a verbal noun derived 
from the verb read, and as the subject of the sentence. 
To the child reading is an act. The word reading 
as the name of the act is once removed, from the act. 
Reading as a noun is twice removed while reading as 
the subject of the sentence is still further removed. 
It is not easy for an adult always to grasp the diffi- 
culty that this abstraction presents to a mind still 
wholly busied with enlarging its knowledge of the mate- 
rial world. Hence grammars for children should advance 
very slowly into this unknown world of metaphysics. 
The function of a word in expressing an idea is the 
phase of its metaphysics first comprehensible to a child. 
In elementary grammars this should always be kept to 
the fore. 
Definitions. — From this point of view many grammars 
begin at the wrong end. The definition, which com- 
monly is the starting-point in each topic, should be 
the end. In pure science the definition is the conclusion 
of observation and generalization. It is the sum of the 
essential knowledge of a subject stated in the most 
succinct form. A full, complete definition is the end of 
knowledge. It can be comprehended only by those who 
know exactly the meanings of all the terms used in it. 
The scientific definition of the Chambered Nautilus, 
Tetrabranchiate Cephalopod, to the scientist is full of 
meaning. It places the animal exactly among all the 
animals of the world. But to the child who knows the 
meaning of neither tefrabranchiate nor cephalopod, it 
is sheer nonsense. Yet a child can know many inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 What Children Study and Why 
esting facts about the creature and can even enjov 
» Dr. Holmes’ beautiful poem. 
Definitions Difficult.— Moreover, in grammar the 
definitions present unusual difficulties to the immature 
mind. The fact that grammar is not an exact science, 
but is based upon opinion and usage, increases the diffi- 
culty. It makes it necessary to define largely by func- 
tion, and yet as some words have many functions, a 
brief but comprehensive statement even of functions 
becomes in such cases practically impossible. 
This difficulty is made evident by attempts to define 
even the most common terms, such as verb, adjective, 
transitive verb, sentence. The only possible complete 
definition of a verb is beyond the comprehension of most 
children in grammar schools. Following the Century 
Dictionary, “ A verb is a word whose function is pred- 
ication.” It is difficult to put this into any form com- 
prehensible to children. Hence the authors of most 
grammars content themselves with stating a single func- 
tion and leave the others to the imagination, or to the 
teacher. Of course, such a statement is not a definition 
at all. For example, the most common definition of 
a verb is “ a word that states,”’ which, of course, excludes 
the question and the command, and hence is inexact. 
“Transitive verb” is practically indefinable to a 
child. : 
Indeed, the noun is almost the only part of speech that 
can be exactly defined in terms that children can readily 
understand. 
I have dwelt upon this matter of definition because 
it is the bugbear of children, and when taught at the 
beginning of a topic, as is the usual way, presents to the
-P-A-G-E-97
  English Grammar 91 
young student no adequate compensation for his toil. 
Even the child who has laboriously memorized it is placed 
in possession of no knowledge that is either exact or 
useful. But the functions of words and of groups of 
words may be so taught in the grammar school as to give 
knowledge that is not only exact but also useful. 
Teaching should be Inductive. — It is evident from 
the above that the method of teaching definitions and 
principles, when the time has arrived for teaching them, 
should be scientific, that is, inductive. Every fact that 
may enter into a subsequent definition or statement of 
principle should first be observed in good literature, so 
that the final statement may be induced from the results 
of observation. 
Definitions stated baldly to children, if learned at 
all, are memorized as words merely, without thought. 
They become meaningless rigmarole. This truth has 
long been accepted for all the physical sciences, but in 
teaching grammar we have been very slow in coming 
to it. . 
Logic of Old Grammars. — In the older grammars the 
treatment was indeed logical, in a poor sense, but without 
regard either to the interest or to the capabilities of the 
learner. Hence the blackness of darkness that comes 
over the imagination when memory transports us to the 
grammar class of our school days. 
The plan pursued was in the main synthetic, until 
“parsing”? and “sentential analysis’? were reached. 
The books were divided into four parts, orthography, 
etymology, syntax, and prosody. A fifth, sometimes 
introduced after orthography, was orthoepy, more often 
treated as a branch of the former subject. We began 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
92 What Children Study and Why 
with letters, then we built them into words, then we 
learned to pronounce the words, then we studied the 
inflections and derivations of words. Finally, we made 
sentences of them. Then we turned about and tore down 
the sentences that we or other authors had built up, and 
studied the parts — analyzed the sentences, and parsed 
the words. 
Through it all, thought was kept in the background. 
The words and combinations of words were studied with 
reference, not to the thought they expressed, but to their 
mechanical arrangement. It was the study of a pur- 
poseless puzzle with the play element left out. 
The Use of the Diagram. — Then some bright genius 
discovered that the solution of this mechanical puzzle 
could be assisted by the use of a mechanical device, — 
this is the age of machinery, —and the “ diagram ” came 
into being. From the point of view held, it was a useful 
device. The ‘hanging of the words on hooks,” as 
Colonel Parker used to call it, furnished something of the 
play element before lacking in the mechanical manipu- 
lation of sentences. But it took the child little nearer 
to the thought expressed by the words. Indeed, too 
often it served as a further diversion and rendered it 
well nigh impossible ever to get back to the thought. 
Many and many a literary gem has been forever spoiled 
to the student by these mechanical processes of parsing, 
analyzing, and diagraming. It would be an interesting 
investigation to inquire by how many “ Paradise Lost ” 
has been all their lives regarded with dread, because of 
its use as a subject for parsing. Analysis, as has been 
said, too often was analysis not of the thought, but of 
the mechanical arrangement of words. Parsing was not 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
English Grammar 93 
ascertaining just what part the individual words served 
in expressing the thought of the sentence, but was the 
arranging of a purely mechanical schedule of relations 
for the words themselves. 
Analysis of an author’s sentences, to get at his meaning 
and to see how he has utilized his verbal materials in 
expressing his meaning, is dealing with a living subject, 
not a dead one. 
Method in teaching Grammar. — How, then, should 
grammar be taught to secure to children its real values, 
— ability better to understand literature, ability to judge 
of the correctness of their own language, and ability to 
think clearly? 
Begin with the Sentence. — The approach should be 
by way of the sentence rather than of the letter or the 
word. Fortunately this approach has been adopted by 
most modern grammars. It is a step toward the sane 
teaching of the subject. The sentence expresses the 
thought, and hence makes an immediate appeal to the 
children, whereas the minor elements, — the words or let- 
ters, — expressing single ideas or fragments of thought 
when used out of association, make no such appeal. The 
letter 6 alone means little. As an element in the word 
blue it has acquired some meaning, but still very little 
for a child. Blue, as the name of an abstract color, 
means a little more than b. Blue sky begins to convey 
a positive impression. But in ‘‘The sky is blue,” we 
first come to a holding thought, and here, too, the words 
first get their real force. 
An adult possessing all the elementary knowledge can 
turn again upon the elements of expression and find an 
interest in the abstract study of them. Not so the child.
-P-A-G-E-100
94 What Children Study and Why 
He must have the larger interest to carry the smaller. 
Interest him in the thought, and he will with profit study 
the tools of expression. But without that interest, his 
study of the tools is futile. Even if he is able to acquire 
some knowledge of the way they work, his time spent 
in the acquisition is wasted. There are more important 
things for him to do than to study a telescope that he 
cannot look through. In these days of complaint of 
overcrowded curricula, economy of time is a serious de- 
mand. We have no right to spend the time of children 
upon purely disciplinary studies, without valuable con- 
tent, while there are so many subjects offering equal dis- 
cipline that include real knowledge. Grammar may be 
given a valuable content even to children by approach- 
ing it through sentences that express thoughts interest- 
ing to them. 
Subject and Predicate. — A sentence is a union of 
subject and predicate to express a thought. Hence 
these two main elements of a sentence must be studied. 
The union and separation of many subjects and predi- 
cates, simple and complex, long and short, should make 
clear to the children, not merely the formal and mechani- 
cal construction of the sentence, but the essential ele- 
ments of thought itself. They should see that not 
merely is a sentence made up of subject and predicate, 
but that a thought is made up of these two elements; 
that they do not think clearly unless they can state 
their thoughts in terms of subject and predicate. 
This exercise may well be followed by a reversal of the 
process, a synthesis of sentences from the elements. 
This can easily be made into an interesting game. The 
sentences should be chosen from well-known proverbs 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
English Grammar 95 
or verses, so that the difficulty may not be too great. 
Then the subjects and predicates should be written sep- 
arately, but not in the same order. The exercise con- 
sists in putting the parts together properly. Thus such 
proverbs as: 
Birds of a feather flock together. 
A rolling stone gathers no moss. 
The race is not always to the swift. 
Wisdom is better than rubies. 
and many more may be written in two columns. 
Birds of a feather is not always to the swift. 
Wisdom gathers no moss. 
The race flocks together. 
A rolling stone is better than rubies. 
The children should then make the correct connections 
and write out the sentences. The exercises should 
include complex sentences as well as simple ones. 
After the component parts of a full thought, as mani- 
fested in the sentence, have been impressed upon the 
children beyond the possibility of loss, then is the time 
to separate the simple subject and predicate from their 
modifiers. This should be done at first without dwelling 
upon any other fact than that the various modifiers add 
to or change the meanings of subject or predicate. 
Thus, “The slothful man saith, ‘there is a lion without,’ ” 
can be readily reduced to man saith. A class will see the 
incompleteness of this as an expression of thought, and 
will readily grasp the meaning that the and slothful add 
a meaning to man, and that “ there is a lion without ” 
is necessary to complete the thought — to tell what the
-P-A-G-E-102
96 What Children Study and Why 
slothful man saith. Similar synthetic exercises to those 
proposed in connection with the first analysis may be 
used here also with profit. 
When these fundamental ideas of subject, predicate, 
and modifiers have been taught fully, then is the proper 
time to study the parts of speech. To postpone this 
study until the sentence has received final treatment is 
in violation of both logic and psychology. 
Parts of Speech. — What do we mean by a “ part 
of speech ’?? Why are words classified as “ parts of 
speech”? Simply because in grammar they have no 
meaning save as parts of speech. Speech stands for 
expression of thought in words. The unit of expression 
is the sentence. So when you speak of a “ part of 
speech” you mean necessarily a part of a sentence. 
That is, a word considered grammatically is merely the 
expression of a part of a thought. With the exceptions 
of the noun used in address, and the interjection, which 
is not properly a part of speech at all, but is merely an 
explosive and thoughtless expression of feeling, a word 
cannot be used sensibly except as a part of a sentence 
expressed or implied. Hence, naturally, with the excep- 
tion of the noun, the part of speech cannot be intelli- 
gently studied until after the nature of a sentence has 
been made plain. 
Study of Relation. — The parts of speech should be 
studied as to their functions in the sentence, and as these 
functions are modified by the relations indicated, these 
relations must be studied at the same time, in order 
to make plain the functions, and hence the meanings, 
of the parts of speech themselves. As the relations of 
words are in many instances shown by inflections, it “
-P-A-G-E-103
English Grammar 97 
follows that inflections must be taught as incidental 
to the study of relations. 
For example, in the sentence, ‘‘Longfellow’s home was 
in Cambridge,” it is not enough to know that Longfellow 
isaname. That indicates only a part of the function of 
the word. Its relation to another noun, home, must be 
made clear. As this relation is indicated by the pos- 
sessive ending ’s, naturally inflection must be taught 
as related to function. That is, we cannot understand 
all the functions of words until we know how they are 
modified in form to express relation. 
It is manifest then that both logic and psychology re- 
quire that grammar be studied by beginners in this order 
— first, the sentence analyzed into subject and predicate, 
and, second, a brief consideration of modifiers; then, 
third, the parts of speech, as parts of the sentence, 
their relations and inflections. 
Beyond this the order is of less consequence, as the 
students will have such a fundamental knowledge as will 
enable them to take up more difficult phases of the sub- 
ject in the order of natural interest. Usually there will 
be a return to the sentence and a more minute analysis 
of it. In particular there should be a thorough study 
of complex and compound sentences and of clauses and 
phrases, which fill the functions of parts of speech. 
This includes all of technical grammar that is profitable 
for the pupils of the grammar school, and this is not 
profitable if studied with any other purpose than that 
of making function manifest. Thought must always 
be to the fore. The instruction in the forms and the 
relations of words must never degenerate into a study 
of mere verbal mechanics,
-P-A-G-E-104
98 What Children Study and Why 
Thought-compelling Material.— To that end it is of 
the utmost importance that the material used be thought- 
compelling material, so that the pupil cannot escape the 
feeling that he is studying the expression of thought. Of 
course, if the study is to be merely the study of mechan- 
ical relations, it is little less than sacrilege to use good 
literature for that end. 4, however, the study is always 
of thought, the better the thought, the more valuable 
the. study. 
It is disheartening to think of boys and girls spending 
their time in school learning that “the big bulldog in Mr. 
Smith’s yard barked,” or that ‘‘ donkeys bray,” especially 
when we must believe that while they are learning those 
startling truths they are learning other facts no less useless. 
Along with the technical study should go studies in 
literature showing how closely the structure of sentences 
is related to the character of the thought expressed, 
how a literary artist of necessity bases his art upon the 
science of grammar. This gives the study of grammar 
a motive that appeals to the children as no mere formal 
study of structure can do. 
Whenever it will serve the purpose of clear illustration, 
connected discourse, such as a complete story or de- 
scription, should be used instead of isolated sentences. 
The greater interest carries the less. This is a great 
psychological principle too often ignored. If a study of 
grammar is a study of the laws of thought in expres- 
sion, and if the aim is to train children, both to com- 
prehend the expressed thought of others and to think 
logically themselves, then it is worth while to study 
these laws as shown in the works of thinkers who were 
also artists in expression.
-P-A-G-E-105

It is of vastly greater value to a class to search a de- 
scription by Hawthorne that has interested and charmed 
them, and find the grammatical forms that have made the 
description possible and given it its clearness and beauty, 
than to find these same forms in disconnected sentences 
containing little thought and no interest. Moreover, 
the memory of the description or story will hold that of 
the grammatical forms, which otherwise would soon be 
forgotten. 
The method of teaching grammar to older students 
is omitted from this book as not germane to its purpose. 
Naturally it would differ in many respects from that out- 
lined above. 
Résumé. — Grammar is the science of language. The 
chief aims of teaching this science are to develop critical 
power, to furnish a corrective of speech, and to train to 
logical and clear thinking. 
All principles and definitions should be developed by 
induction and never baldly stated. The more abstruse 
topics and the finer distinctions should be omitted from 
an elementary grammar. 
The method of instruction should require the analysis 
of thought rather than the discovery of conventional rela- 
tions of words, and of structure as related to thought. 
To this end the material used should be drawn from good 
literature and should be thought-compelling, since the 
greater interest carries the less. This literature should be 
treated respectfully with a view to a better understand- 
ing of it through a knowledge of grammar.

CHAPTER VIII 
SPELLING 
ENGuIsH spelling is “ peculiar.” It obeys no laws, fol- 
lows few principles. Itis a strange medley of the labors 
of philologists, pseudo-philologists, ignorant printers, and 
equally ignorant writers who have attempted to follow 
some real or imaginary auditory analogy. It is a mass 
of conventions resting upon no rhyme or reason. 
Learning to spell is one of the immutable requirements 
of the school. By success in teaching spelling the school 
is judged, to a very large degree. Yet the educational 
value of learning to spell is so slight as to be negligible. 
Spelling according to convention satisfies no psycho- 
logical need, no spiritual craving, no aspiration. The 
economic value of spelling is arbitrary and artificial. 
It adds not a cent’s worth to the world’s wealth. Yet, 
teach it we must. Spelling well is much like wearing 
modish garments; it has much to do with fixing one’s 
place in the world of educated people. At least a lack 
of it at once places one among the ignorant. : 
These facts are so patent and so widely recognized that 
we have the Reformed Spelling Board maintained by the 
benefaction of a great “ gift giver.’ The aim of this 
Board is to simplify spelling by removing some of its 
worst absurdities, but unfortunately their efforts thus 
far do not offer much hope of a scientific solution of 
the problem, The changes suggested by them are so 
TOQ 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
Spelling IOI 
scattered that in the eyes of a disinterested observer they 
seem to add to the complications by giving new forms 
to learn, without such an exact classification as to enable 
us to use them, except by a sheer act of unaided memory 
in the case of each change suggested. The best that can 
be said of their efforts thus far is that they show good 
intentions. 
So, for the present at least, and doubtless for a long 
time to come, the children in school must go on learning 
to spell the old forms, and the question for the teacher 
still is how to teach this conventional art most effectively 
in the shortest time. 
There is little to aid in this. There are almost no 
rules of spelling that are even moderately reliable. 
Attempts to teach spelling by rule simply add to the 
child’s troubles. A few analc.ies may be followed, but 
with timid steps for fear of the many pitfalls. The sole 
reliance is memory, and the sole aid is found in obeying 
the general laws of memory, such as association of ideas, 
interest, vividness of impression, repetition, recency. 
Words that have no meaning to the children, and taught 
without relation, are sure to be forgotten, except by those 
rare persons who have a “ gift ” for spelling. And it is 
often the case that this peculiar gift is possessed by those 
having little intellectual power of any other sort. 
The late Superintendent B. C. Gregory, as the result of 
a series of very interesting observations,’ showed clearly 
that children most frequently misspell the common 
words which they have first learned by ear. This is nat- 
ural enough, in view of the irregularities of our spelling, 
and the lack of agreement between the written form and 
1“ Better Schools,” page 169 ff.
-P-A-G-E-108
    102 What Children Study and Why 
its phonic equivalent. When the word is learned first 
from the printed page, it is much more likely to be spelled 
correctly. The reason is obvious. Hence especial em- 
phasis should be placed upon the spelling of colloquial 
words. 
Spelling is altogether a writing exercise. From this a 
natural inference would be that spelling should be learned 
by writing only. But this is not the fact. Although the 
English language is by no means phonic in its written 
structure, still there is a close association between oral 
and written spelling, so that the oral exercise supple- 
ments the written, often with very great advantage. 
There are, however, wide differences among people 
in this regard. The familiar terms ‘ ear-minded ” 
and “ eye-minded ” indicate this. Some are particularly 
sensitive to auditory impressions, others to visual. 
This has, however, nothing to do with phonics. It 
simply means that some children will remember the com- 
ponent letters of a word more surely, and hence will be 
able to write the word more accurately, if they have first 
spelled it aloud. Some, before writing a doubtful word, 
will fortify themselves by repeating the letters “ to them- 
selves.” With others the visual impression is sufficient 
and the oral spelling seems only to confuse them. 
This effect of speaking the letters, either aloud or 
silently, is probably due more to muscular memory than 
to sounds. This same muscular memory extends to the 
hands and arms and other muscles used in writing and 
results in a form of muscular habit which enables the 
educated adult to write words correctly, without thinking 
of the spelling and even without consciously seeing it. 
These facts must be borne in mind in teaching spelling.
-P-A-G-E-109
CHAPTER IX 
SPELLING 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
How then may children be so taught as to make the 
correct spelling of ordinary well-known words automatic, 
without wasting time that is needed for more important 
matters? — 
There is noroyal road. The ordinary person learns to 
spell through a sheer act of memory. Hence the effective 
teaching of spelling must be secured through obedience 
to the laws of memory. The first and most important 
of these is the law of “‘ The Association of Ideas.” The 
spelling of words is more easily remembered if the words 
themselves are so used in relation to ideas that they leave 
a distinct impression. It is easier to remember the spell- 
ing of words used in interesting sentences and paragraphs 
than of words learned in “ lists ” without relation. 
Next to the association of ideas, the most important 
of the laws of memory for the teaching of spelling is 
vividness of impression. The sequence of letters in a 
word to be spelled should be burned into the mind. 
Various means and devices may be used to effect this. 
Hard words, words likely to be misspelled, should be 
spelled both orally and in writing: orally, to secure the 
right habit of feeling of the muscles used in speaking, 
— this is especially important for those children who speak 
the letters to themselves while spelling; in writing, 
103
-P-A-G-E-110
  
  104 What Children Study and Why 
because it is in writing that the final test comes. If we 
used speech orally only, we should have no spelling at all. 
But before spelling in any way, care should be exercised 
to secure close attention to the word as correctly spelled. 
Most people misspell words because they have not looked 
at them sharply enough to make sure of the letters used 
or of their order. : 
If the word in itself is interesting and conveys some 
idea that holds the attention, it is easier to secure correct 
spelling, especially if it is a word not known colloquially. 
But even in such a case, it is frequently necessary to make 
an especial effort to focus undivided attention upon the 
spelling itself. 
Among the many possible devices that may be used 
to this end, I will mention but one, which has been used 
in different places with much success. It is a black- 
board exercise, the entire class being at the board. 
It may, however, be modified, if the blackboards have 
not room enough for all, by having some pupils work at 
their desks. 
The teacher writes a word on the board. The class all 
look at it for a brief space of time. Then the teacher 
erases the word. The class turn and write it. The 
teacher inspects the work. If any cre in error, the error 
is not pointed out, but all are told to erase. The teacher 
again writes the word and erases. All spell it. This is 
continued until all have spelled correctly. This secures 
close attention and confidence, as the children are not 
told whether they have erred or not ; and it also results in 
permanence of impression. It is an excellent device for 
correcting carelessness of observation, which is at the 
bottom of most bad spelling.
-P-A-G-E-111
Spelling 105 
Should spelling books be used, and if so, how? 
If all teachers had plenty of time and the necessary 
judgment properly to select and arrange words taken from 
the other school subjects, these words would furnish 
nearly all the spelling lessons needed. The written les- 
sons themselves supply the best spelling exercises, espe- 
cially if followed by rigid drill upon words misspelled. 
But unfortunately the average teacher has neither the 
time nor the training necessary to the preparation of 
adequate lists of words to be spelled. 
Some years ago the spelling book became unpopular 
and bade fair to fall into desuetude. In many places 
it disappeared altogether and the sole reliance was placed 
upon the spelling required for the written work of the 
school. Here and there an exceptional teacher succeeded 
remarkably well. But, generally, the effort was not 
successful. Lists were neglected or carelessly prepared. 
In written work upon other subjects, the attention was 
so taken with other matters that spelling was often over- 
looked. Even in the best schools it was found that many 
important words did not occur in the regular written 
work. Hence there has been a general return to the 
spelling book, and of necessity ; not, however, to take the 
place of the careful attention to spelling in all written 
exercises, but to supplement it, and emphasize it. It is 
found that intensive study is necessary; therefore the 
spelling book is bound still to be the symbol of the 
elementary school. 
But there are spelling books and spelling books, books 
with all conceivable plans of association, and books with 
no plan at all. In general, those books are the most 
helpful in which words are grouped according to some 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
   
      106 What Children Study and Why 
manifest relation of ideas. Phonic relations, of all, are 
of the least consequence because of the irregularity of the 
phonic elements of our language. 
Words may be grouped more profitably according to 
similarity of meaning or function; as, for example, words 
expressing time, days of the week, months, seasons; 
words descriptive of color, or sound, or landscapes, or 
farm life, or city life. Good groups may be made of 
synonyms, of the various inflectional forms of verbs, of 
certain classes of derivatives. Except for review exer- 
cises and for occasional drill, sentences, paragraphs, or 
short literary selections having an interesting content 
make the best spelling lessons. 
But teachers have to use spelling books, not make them, 
and they must make the best of those furnished, supple- 
menting them by exercises drawn from the other school 
work, or better, supplementing careful attention to the 
spelling in ordinary written exercises by a discriminating 
use of the spelling book. 
Dr. J. M. Rice, in a series of articles in The Forum, 
gave the results of tests in spelling made in many schools 
upon thousands of children. While these experiments did 
not solve many of the mooted questions, they did throw 
interesting light upon the problem asa whole. Perhaps 
the most important contribution of Dr. Rice to the sub- 
ject was the evidence that in teaching spelling method 
made very little difference, and that beyond a small 
minimum the amount of time spent had very little to do 
with the results. Children who spelled ten minutes a 
day showed as great efficiency as those who spelled forty. 
The most important factor appeared to be the qual- 
ity of the teaching. The reasons why time is so   
-P-A-G-E-113
  Spelling 107 
negligible a factor were psychological, and cannot be 
entered into here. As a whole this experiment forced 
the conclusion that intensity of attention and systematic 
organization were the most important elements in the 
teaching of spelling. 
Whatever the devices or methods used, we cannot get 
away from the fact that spelling rests upon memory, 
unaided except by the laws of memory.

  CHAPTER X 
ARITHMETIC 
Meaning of Arithmetic. — Arithmetic is the key to an 
exact knowledge of the physical universe and to many of 
the relations of man to man. It is commonly defined as 
“The Science of Numbers.”’ Considering the subject 
abstractly as an exact science, this definition is of course 
correct. 
Arithmetic as taught in schools is a somewhat promis- 
cuous aggregation of topics all treating more or less 
fully of number in the abstract, or of some one or more 
of its applications, either to the physical world or to the 
affairs of life. In general its function is to acquaint the 
young student with the more prominent characteristics 
of abstract number and of number relations, with the 
prevailing system of numeration, and with a few of the 
most important practical applications of number to hu-— 
man needs. It also seeks to make clear, to a very limited 
degree, the numerical basis of the physical world. 
The treatment of abstract number and number rela- 
tions in our school system is found in such elementary 
work as counting and the study of the four fundamental 
principles, in the consideration of the nature of factors 
and multipliers and of fractions and of powers and roots. 
The prevailing system of numeration is learned abstractly, 
first as applied to whole numbers and decimals, and 
afterward through its use in expressing all numerical 
108
-P-A-G-E-115
  ‘Arithmetic 109 
characteristics and relations. The application of num- 
ber to the affairs of men is taught by means of various 
problems, following the treatment of each phase of ab- 
stract number, and especially in those parts of the text- 
book devoted to imaginary business transactions. The 
consideration of number as the key to the physical uni- 
verse is found in the study of form and dimension, espe- 
cially under such headings as, “ Denominate Numbers,” 
and “ Mensuration.” 
Numeration the Basis of Thinking. Fundamental 
Principles. — (1) Numeration lies at the foundation of 
thinking. The absolute basis of thought is compari- 
son of ideas. Such comparison is impossible without 
at least a rudimentary conception of number. I can- 
not think an absolutely solitary unit. To the idea in 
contemplation my own personality is added, and almost 
invariably at least one other object enters into the 
comparison. If all objects, ourselves included, were 
spherical, we could have no conception of a sphere. It_ 
is only by contrasting that particular form with other 
forms that we can know it. So we must know more 
than one, as more than one, in order to think at all. 
Probably the maximum number that can be compre- 
hended from the direct contemplation of objects does not 
exceed five. Three seems to be the limit among most 
savage peoples. 
As the comparison of objects necessary for thinking 
gives the first notion of number, this notion grows uncon- 
sciously with the extension of the field of thought. But 
because of the limited power of the mind to grasp at 
once several objects presented through the senses, unless 
this vague number conception be aided and enlarged by
-P-A-G-E-116
  IIo What Children Study and Why 
means of a system of numeration, the power of thought 
itself is limited and we have the reasoning power of the 
infant continued through life, as in the savage. 
But with a system there is no limit to computation, not 
even the hypothetical limit to the number of existing 
countable objects. Both the infinitely large and the in- 
finitely small become the commonplaces of mathematics. 
Counting the First Step. — (2) It follows that the first 
step in the development of a systematic knowledge of 
number must necessarily be counting: that is, the as- 
sembling under a definite numerical system and nomen- 
clature of several objects on no other ground than that 
of some qualitative likeness. Exact measurement, the 
recognition of the quantitative likeness of the objects 
compared, comes later. In other words, we first teach 
pupils to count things; as, for example, the children 
present, —it matters not how widely they differ in 
height or weight. 
The notion of numerical progression through a con- 
siderable field having been established by counting, the 
next step is to exact calculation or measuring; quanti- 
tative relations take the place of qualitative; how many 
yields to how much, and ratio takes the place of counting. 
Frequently, perhaps in most cases, this stage will have 
been passed before the children come to school. This 
is especially true of those who have enjoyed the advan- 
tage of good kindergarten training. 
In the chapters dealing with Method, I shall take it 
for granted that the counting stage has been passed by 
the children before the formal work of teaching arith- 
metic is undertaken in school, and that they are ready 
for the second step. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
Arithmetic III 
Number a Mental Product. —(3) Number is a mental 
product, not a physical condition. Things, but not num- 
bers, exist outside the mind. Numerical facts are not 
the facts of physics. To quote Professor William James 
(“ Psychology,” Vol. II, p. 655): “‘ The same real things 
are countable in numberless ways, and pass from one 
numerical form, not only to its equivalent (as Mill 
implies), but to its other, as the sport of physical acci- 
dents, or of our mode of attending, may decide. How 
could our notion that one and one are eternally and 
necessarily two ever maintain itself in a world where 
every time we add one drop of water to another we get, 
not two, but one again? In a world where every time 
we add a drop to a crumb of quicklime we get a dozen 
or more? Had it no better warrant than such expe- 
riences, at most we could then say that one and one are 
usually two. Our arithmetical propositions would never 
have the confident tone which they now possess. That 
confident tone is due to the fact that they deal with ab- 
stract and ideal numbers exclusively.” 
Counting and reckoning consist in the grouping of 
objects by the mind to any quantitative extent and in 
any numerical arrangement in such ways as to satisfy 
some need — to make possible the definite consideration 
of objects for higher uses. 
Need of System. — (4) It is of comparatively little use 
to me to be able to think numerical relations even with 
perfect clearness, unless I can communicate my thoughts 
to others and establish with them relations on a numeri- 
cal basis. 
Hence a system of numeration establishes a common 
ground, a clearing house, of number concepts, so that the 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
      112 What Children Study and Why 
number element may enter definitely and effectively 
into human relations. 
Upon number systems (arithmetic in the larger sense), 
then, depend not only all higher forms and systems of 
knowledge, all extended thought, but also very many so- 
cial relations, including all forms of exchange, whether 
of labor or commodities, whereby our wants are sup- 
plied. : 
The importance of these fundamental principles, simple 
as they are, will appear when we come to discuss methods 
of instruction. 
Why teach arithmetic in school ? 
The Utilitarian End.— The ends of teaching arithme- 
tic are two: one utilitarian, the other educational. The 
former is the end that appeals to most people and is 
the one usually put forward as the basis for a demand 
for more time and attention to this one of the three R’s. 
Doubtless more criticism is passed upon the modern 
school because of the alleged failures of young people to 
meet the arithmetical requirements of business than for 
any other reason, not excepting bad spelling. 
That there is some ground for this faultfinding is 
doubtless true. However, the value of full courses in 
arithmetic to the business man is greatly overestimated, 
and in many cases perverted; that is, portions of the 
arithmetic that are supposed to have great utilitarian 
value have little or none. 
If arithmetic were to be limited solely to its “ bread 
and butter ’’ values, a very small book indeed would be 
required ; and while much drill and much practice would 
be devoted to this irreducible minimum, still the time 
given to the subject would be greatly lessened. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  Arithmetic 113 
But arithmetic has a further use — the educational 
—and the question as to quantity and method for this 
use is not easily disposed of. This will be treated later. 
Minimum Practical Need. — What knowledge of arith- 
metic does the average business man need, and how can 
the school best supply it? He should be able to add, 
subtract, multiply, and divide integers, simple common 
fractions, and decimals extended to include the prin- 
ciples of percentage and simple interest, with a very 
few tables of denominate numbers. Ordinary business 
requires no more than this. Special lines of business 
have special requirements, as that of the broker or ‘the 
banker or the surveyor. But to meet such special de- 
mands is not the function of the elementary school. 
Indeed, such particular equipment can be obtained best 
and most economically in the business itself; and most. 
business men prefer it so. 
Should we then omit all else from our arithmetic, 
considered on a purely utilitarian basis? Let us see what 
would be dropped. 
I have before me two of the very latest and most 
radical grammar school arithmetics. One of them con- 
tains 378 pages of material for pupils’ use. Of these, 
205 are given to subjects not included in our list of util- 
itarian necessities, leaving a book of essentials containing 
but 173 pages. The additional pages are taken up with 
matter largely modern, but educational rather than util- 
itarian in purpose.

This book also gives tables for Troy Weight, Apothe- 
caries’ Weight, and Surveyors’ Measure. 
Both books, in addition to the many pages devoted to 
enriching the subject beyond the utilitarian essentials, 
furnish much valuable information on many subjects, 
by means of problems illustrating the different funda- 
mental principles. 
It is evident that the authors added this large amount 
of matter because of its supposed educational value. 
The two books analyzed are exceptional in that they 
omit much traditional matter found in older arithmetics, 
originally placed there for the same reasons that other 
more modern foreign matter has been put into the 
newer books. 
Following are the most common of these traditional 
subjects, found in nearly all arithmetics, excepting the 
most recent : 
Equation of Payments, Alligation, Compound Propor- 
tion, Partnership, Series, Annual Interest, Duodecimals, 
Exchange. Besides these are the following, which are also 
still retained by the most modern books: “ Applica- 
tions ” of Percentage and Interest, including Insurance, 
Profit and Loss (fictitious largely); True Discount; 
Commission; and Brokerage (obsolete in method); 
Stocks; Partial Payments; Addition, Subtraction, Mul- 
tiplication, and Division of Compound Numbers, and 
also certain obsolete and special tables of Denominate 
Numbers. 
Truly this is an array that in these days of curricula 
crowded with cultural studies needs justification. 
It is not necessary to discuss the utilitarian value of 
the fundamental processes, or of those simpler branches
-P-A-G-E-122
116 What Children Study and Why 
of arithmetical knowledge that I have mentioned as 
necessary for the business man. Some may, however, 
question the possibility of omitting the subjects men- 
tioned as unnecessary for the business man. 
Let us see. Obsolete methods of conducting business 
surely are not practically useful. This will leave out 
the greater part of the “ applications of percentage ” 
as given in the books, including Partial Payments, 
Commission, Brokerage, Profit and Loss, True Discount, 
and operations in compound numbers with obsolete or 
unusual tables and terms, such as Troy Weight, gill, 
stone, square, and the various barrels; also Equation of 
Payments, Alligation, Duodecimals, Compound Propor- 
tion and Partnership. 
Equation of payments has not even a modern equiva- 
lent. The same is true of duodecimals, except for purely 
theoretical discussion, or in fields uncommon. No one 
outside of schools adds 6 Ib. 5 oz. of butter to 2 cwt. 
17 lb. and 3 oz. Noone multiplies 2 mi. 3 roods, 2 rd. 
11 yd. 2 ft. 9 in., by 73. In the cases requiring reckon- 
ing upon compound numbers, decimals or common 
fractions are used. 
Not even the surveyor extracts square root or the 
lumberman cube root. I question whether any one who 
may read this article has ever had occasion to use either 
except in school. They are blessings for the learning mind 
alone, too precious for the coarser uses of the business 
man. Hence on utilitarian grounds these subjects all 
should go. 
The teaching of the terms and processes used in only 
single specific lines of business cannot but be regarded 
as wasteful for the average child on “ practical ” grounds.
-P-A-G-E-123
  Arithmetic 117 
This eliminates such subjects as mensuration, surveying, 
and astronomical reckoning, including longitude and time. 
What shall we say of algebra and geometry? And 
should such subjects as stocks, profit and loss, and 
brokerage be retained with modern methods substituted 
for the obsolete? 
As to, algebra and geometry, it is enough to say that 
the average business man is wholly ignorant of them, and 
that they could not be applied to the solution of the 
simple and manifest problems which constitute almost 
the whole mathematical demand of ordinary business. 
Their educational value is another story. 
As to the practical importance of teaching modern 
methods of certain lines of business in substitution for 
the obsolete methods of the older textbooks, this may 
be said: Much may profitably be taught incidentally 
as to business principles-and methods, through problems 
given to illustrate the fundamental principles. This 
is not only unobjectionable, but is very desirable. It 
is one of the ways of imparting a sense of reality to 
school work for the child. Indeed, the choice of prob- 
lems, vital in character, is one of the admirable char- 
acteristics of the newer books. But to introduce into 
arithmetic on utilitarian grounds a subject that is 
chiefly cultural is objectionable, unless it be a subject 
of very general usefulness. Are any of the above-named 
subjects of sufficient value even in their most modern 
form to justify their retention in a “ practical ” arith- 
metic? 
Of the “applications of percentage,” insurance is 
possibly of sufficient general interest to justify a 
reasonably full treatment.
-P-A-G-E-124
  118 What Children Study and Why 
The number of people engaged in business requiring 
the payment of commissions is so small comparatively 
that any considerable amount of space for this subject 
is not justified on a bread-and-butter basis. 
Exchange is too vague and too limited in use to deserve 
a large place. Brokerage is merely simple percentage. 
Of stocks it may be well to teach just enough to enable 
a pupil to understand quotations. Taxes and duties 
affect all and should be taught thoroughly. 
As compound interest is reckoned in savings banks, 
the banks of the many and the ignorant, it is doubtless 
well to teach enough of it to enable depositors to figure 
their interest. All methods of computing simple interest 
but one, the one employed in banks, may be omitted. 
The use of the metric system among us is still, and is 
likely to be for long years to come, limited to technical 
treatises on scientific subjects. The prospect offers no 
justification for teaching it in elementary schools, on 
economic grounds. 
Hence we are forced to the doctrine that on utilitarian 
grounds alone the only portions of arithmetic that 
should be retained are the fundamental “ principles,” 
simple fractions with denominators that can be reduced 
to a common denominator by factoring at sight; deci- 
mals; percentage, and interest, including just enough 
of the “ applications ” to furnish the necessary drill and 
practice; one method of computing interest; taxes and 
duties; enough of compound interest to enable the sav- 
ings bank depositor to understand his bank book. To 
these should be added the more important tables of 
denominate numbers. 
This would make a small book and save time, while 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  Arithmetic 11g 
it would undoubtedly encourage more persistent drill 
upon the subjects taught and, probably, would secure 
greater accuracy. 
Cultural Value. — Let us consider now the cultural 
value of arithmetic and determine, if possible, how 
many and what subjects should be retained in it on 
this ground. 
How may arithmetic serve the general education, 
the culture, of the child? In two ways: one by 
“training his mind,” securing accurate and _ reliable 
processes of mental activity,—in brief, by teaching 
him to think; the other by enriching his mental 
content, that is by giving him knowledge not merely 
for immediate utility but for broadening his out- 
look, extending his sympathies and supplying apper- 
ceiving centers. : 
We must bear in mind that in order to justify the 
attempts to secure these ends through the study of 
arithmetic it is necessary to show that this subject 
furnishes the best and most economical means for 
securing them. Otherwise they should be cut down or 
omitted and more efficient cultural agencies substituted. 
Arithmetic is the logic of the child. It is almost the 
only means available for teaching him the certainties of 
logical processes, the reliability of the syllogism. It is 
the only field of absolute truth where determinable 
effect always follows determined cause. Dr. David 
Eugene Smith in “ The Teaching of Elementary Mathe- 
matics,” p. 25, says: 
“The fact that the child finds a positive truth an 
immutable law at the time in his development when he is 
naturally filled with doubt, with the desire to investi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 What Children Study and Why 
gate, and with the feeling that he must put away childish 
things, has a value difficult properly to appreciate. He 
is not sure that every flower has petals, that every animal 
needs oxygen, that ‘most unkindest’ is bad grammar, 
or that Columbus was the real discoverer of America ; 
but he is sure, and no argument can shake his faith, that 
whatever may happen to the universe in which he lives 
(a+b)? will always equal a? + 2 ab + 0.” 
But this particular mental poweris best obtained through 
dealing with numbers as abstract rather than through 
the solution of difficult business problems. It is the 
exact result of the action of known causes that gives the 
training in deductive or mathematical reasoning. There 
may be, however, some mental gain from the solution 
of even individual problems. Upon this point I again 
quote Dr. Smith: 
“So Arithmetic may, even by obsolete problems, train 
the mind of the child logically to attack the everyday 
problems of life. If he has been taught to think in solv- 
ing his school problems, he will think in solving the 
broader ones which he must hereafter meet. The same 
forms of logic, the same attention to detail, the same 
patience, and the same care in checking results exercised 
in solving a problem in greatest common divisor, may 
show itself years later in commerce, in banking, or in 
one of the learned professions. Hence, Arithmetic, 
when taught with this in mind, gives to the pupil not 
knowledge of facts alone, but that which transcends such 
knowledge, namely, power. 
“Tt must not, however, be thought from its name that 
this culture phase of the subject is of value only as a 
luxury, like the ability to dabble in music or painting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
Arithmetic 121 
Just because it is the child of the man in poor or modest 
circumstances who must make his own way in the world, 
it is for the common people that this culture phase is 
most valuable.” 
Still, it seems to me evident that the solution of com- 
plicated problems tends to divert the attention from the 
deductive processes to the practical aspects of the ques- 
tions, the assembling and assorting of the causal facts. 
. Algebra. — Unquestionably the most valuable part of 
arithmetic for the cultivation of reasoning power is (if I 
may be allowed), not arithmetic at all, but algebra. 
The tendency of modern books to introduce, early, 
algebraic terms and methods, the unknown quantity and 
the equation, cannot be too highly commended from the 
cultural viewpoint, because the former deals with 
specific instances, the latter with generalizations. De- 
spite all the general statements appearing in the form of 
rules, an arithmetical statement of fact stands for itself 
alone; 2+3=5 remains that and nothing more, while 
a+b=c stands for an infinite number of possible terms, 
for all of which it is equally true. 
Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the “ Autocrat,” tells 
us: 
“T was just going to say, when I was interrupted, 
that one of the many ways of classifying minds is under 
the heads of arithmetical and algebraical intellects. All 
economical and practical wisdom is an extension or vari- 
ation of the following arithmetical formula: 2+2=4. 
Every philosophical proposition has the more general 
character of the expression a+b=c. We are mere 
operatives, empirics, and egotists, until we learn to think 
in letters instead of figures.”
-P-A-G-E-128
122 What Children Study and Why 
Some of the subjects rejected as not of “ practical ” 
value belong properly in algebra. Such subjects as pro- 
portion and series, awkward in arithmetic because of 
lack of suitable terms, are simple in algebra. Indeed, 
if these and other such subjects are to be retained in 
arithmetic for their cultural value, it is quite important 
that the algebraic method of teaching them be used in 
order that they may furnish the desired training in logic. 
Truly the argument in favor of the retention of sub- 
jects that cultivate the power to think is strong. This 
is the highest power of the intellect and it is none too 
common, while no subject can be introduced into the 
elementary curriculum so well calculated to train it as 
the “ back part ” of the arithmetic. 
In the higher grammar grades a definite course in 
elementary algebra is of great value, especially to the 
many students whose schooling ends with the grammar 
school. 
Geometry. — The study of the elements of geometry, 
usually introduced as “ form study ” and mensuration, 
may be classed with that of algebra. Its chief value 
rests upon the importance of a knowledge of form and 
dimension to a comprehension of the physical universe. 
Constructive geometry and mensuration, as usually 
found in the arithmetics, appeal not so much to the 
reason as to the imagination. They tend also to sub- 
stitute an exact knowledge of the environing world for a 
vague and comparatively useless knowledge, while de- 
ductive geometry, even as introduced in arithmetic in 
the application of formule and other generalizations to 
the solution of problems in mensuration, shows a plain 
path to abstract reasoning. Problems in geometry, 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Arithmetic 123 
moreover, can be offered that will be “ practical ” with- 
out detracting from their value in training to think. 
So much for the “‘ unpractical ” subjects that cultivate 
the reasoning power. The test question, ‘“ Could the 
same result be secured more effectively and economically 
by any other means?” must be answered in the nega- 
tive. These are the subjects, par excellence, for teach- 
ing children to think, and on that ground their presence 
in our arithmetics is justified. 
Enrichment of Content. — The second of the cultural 
values to be obtained through the study of arithmetic 
is the enrichment of the mental content, the enlarge- 
ment of the field of knowledge. What subjects not 
required on economic ground should find a place in 
arithmetic because they represent valuable knowledge 
of the world and of human affairs that can be given 
best in connection with the study of number -relations? 
This offers a wide field of investigation, upon which we 
can only touch here, limiting ourselves to the tradi- 
tional subjects referred to above. 
Of these, the applications of arithmetic to certain 
special lines of business are the most numerous. There 
is indeed strong reason for acquainting children with 
the general outlines of some of those business operations 
which are of universal interest, even though compara- 
tively few people are directly engaged in them. An ex- 
ample is the corporation with its issues of stocks and 
bonds. Although few of the children are likely to have 
any active connection with such corporations, all citizens 
should know about them. They are now common sub- 
jects of discussion in the press, and of legislation, upon 
which universal intelligence is demanded. Besides, they 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  124 What Children Study and Why 
are the most common form of property for the invest- 
ment of savings, and they are explained more naturally 
in connection with arithmetic than elsewhere. 
In connection with these, brokerage and commission 
may be taught with almost no additional effort. The 
essential features of banking, including the function of 
the clearing house, are of such universal interest that 
they should be included in the grammar school arith- 
metic. 
Taxes and duties have also an economic value and 
belong in arithmetic on all grounds. On the other hand, 
such topics as partial payments, duodecimals, equation 
of payments, and compound proportion have no such 
universal application and should be omitted from the 
common school arithmetic altogether. 
Among the topics relating to the physical world the 
same distinction may be made. 
“Longitude and time ” is of universal interest, and 
although one may be able to tell time by the clock with- 
out understanding the reason, still knowledge of the laws 
that determine time for us is rich and pregnant knowl- 
edge. The only question is whether arithmetic or 
geography is the proper place for it in the school. In 
the present unsatisfactory state of geography teaching 
I believe that it is safer to trust it to arithmetic. Geog- 
raphy is even more crowded with poor relations than is 
arithmetic. Besides, the mathematical element is so 
evident in longitude and time, that it is a good subject 
through which to show the mathematical basis of the 
physical universe, one of the very large truths that 
children should acquire from the study of arithmetic. 
The various topics included under ‘“ Mensuration ”
-P-A-G-E-131
  Arithmetic 125 
have been discussed in relation to training the reason. 
They have no place in arithmetic on the ground of en- 
larging the field of general knowledge, except incidentally. 
Cube root has no place on any ground and square 
root is doubtful. They are very hard in arithmetic 
and very easy in algebra and geometry. 
The metric system raises a difficult question. As it 
is the system in general use among the Latin nations, 
and is frequently used in scientific treatises written in 
English, knowledge of it is very desirable, and, of course, 
if it is to be studied in school, arithmetic is the place for 
it. It is not difficult to learn and the pupil of the higher 
grades, with a very little effort, can master it sufficiently 
to be able to read books using it and to image dimen- 
sions expressed in it, by a rough comparison with our 
own system. 
It is not necessary to discuss other topics specifically. 
The general principle applies to them all. If they are 
subjects of sufficient cultural value to demand a place 
in the course of study and if arithmetic is the most 
natural place in the course for them, there they should 
remain; otherwise, not. 
Résumé. — A conception of number is fundamental 
to even the most elementary thinking. A system of 
numbers is essential to all the higher realms of thought, 
and also to effective communication among thinking 
beings. 
Arithmetic has both a utilitarian and a cultural value. 
For the former, more than half of the ordinary arith- 
metic is nearly or wholly worthless. The essential sub- 
jects to this end are the fundamental processes. 
For the latter, the subject as a whole is very valuable, 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 What Children Study and Why 
especially in cultivating the power to reason. The most 
important subjects for this end are the fundamental 
processes and the methods of algebra and geometry. 
Of the subjects falling under the head of “ general 
information,” the principles of special lines of business 
of nearly universal interest may properly be included 
in arithmetic, as may longitude and time and possibly 
the metric system. 
Subjects should not be introduced to children through 
arithmetic for their cultural effects, unless arithmetic is 
the best avenue for securing those effects. Many of the 
subjects whose avowed aim is to acquaint the child 
with the sciences or with business usage should be omitted 
as foreign to the subject. But problems throwing light 
upon those subjects may be used profitably for illustra- 
tion and for practice under the essential subjects, and thus 
incidentally may supply cultural elements.

  CHAPTER XI 
ARITHMETIC 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
Ends to be Secured. — In considering ‘methods of in- 
struction in arithmetic, we must bear in mind the gen- 
eral results to be secured. (1) Facility and accuracy in 
the use of numbers, as applied to the simple operations 
which constitute the great part of ordinary business 
calculations; (2) such culture as can best be obtained 
in connection with the study of numbers, this culture 
falling into two classes: (a) the power to reason 
justly, a result of the logic of mathematical reasoning, 
inexorable, although limited in application; and (@) such 
knowledge of the physical world and of human relations 
as is expressed chiefly in numerical terms. 
The classroom teacher usually has little to say as to 
what topics in arithmetic he shall teach. They are 
fixed in the course of study. He may, however, at least 
to a degree, so present even unnecessary topics as to 
determine the character of the results. 
It will be manifestly impossible in a single article to 
treat other than typical subjects for the different grades. 
The Time Element. — Time is a very important ‘ele- 
ment in acquiring accuracy and facility in the manipu- 
lation of numbers, especially in the primary grades. 
The chief end of arithmetic teaching in the primary 
school is the mastery of the fundamental combinations 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  128 What Children Study and Why 
of addition and of the multiplication table. The accu- 
rate use of these should become automatic, so that it will 
be practically impossible for a child to make a mistake. 
Most arithmetics and most courses of study hurry 
this process. They crowd the tables together, without 
allowing time enough for each one to “ soak in.” 
The development should be very gradual. Each 
combination and each table should be taught by itself 
and should be emphasized by such a variety of exer- 
cises that it can never be forgotten. The study of the 
multiplication table should be slowly and consistently 
cumulative. Fractions should be taught correctly at 
the same time, thus laying a foundation for their more 
intensive study later. It takes little additional effort, 
while learning that four times four equals sixteen, to 
learn that four is one fourth of sixteen. 
The Utilitarian Ends. — First, then, how shall a child 
secure facility and accuracy in calculation? 
Drill. — The teacher’s one invariable means to this 
end has always been drill, by which is meant iteration, 
repeating number combinations over and over again 
until the brain paths become fixed and the action 
automatic. Unquestionably drill of this sort will be 
always an important means to this end. If the only 
elements of this so-called practical aim of arithmetic 
were rapid and exact addition, subtraction, multi- 
plication, and division of integers, such drill might 
possibly suffice, although even then the psychological 
difficulty of loss of interest and consequent limitation of 
progress would of necessity manifest itself. Automatic 
processes are naturally self-limiting. 
But even the most fact-loving of Gradgrinds is not 
   
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Arithmetic 129 
satisfied with the mere ability to combine and separate 
integers under the four “ fundamental principles.” It 
must be possible to use them in business problems, also 
with facility and accuracy. It must, too, be possible 
to deal accurately and swiftly with fractions, common 
and decimal. These requirements demand more than 
mere calculating machines. They demand the power 
to think, which drill alone cannot furnish. Here the 
first aim touches the second, and it becomes apparent 
that no mere mechanical drill is sufficient for even its 
own ends. So we must include some of the suggestions 
for the second end in our treatment of the first. 
Method must vary with Age. — There is no uniform 
methed of teaching arithmetic. The method must vary 
with the age of the children studying and with their 
differing powers to think in abstract terms. 
In arithmetic, as in morals and in all the common 
affairs of life, there is a place for authority, as well as 
for reasoning. The power of self-direction is itself a 
growth. The young child must be told many things 
outright long before he can comprehend them. He 
must also do many things in obedience to authority until 
he is able to “reason out” a course of action. The 
fault of the old teaching lay, not in its use of authority, 
but in its abuse of it. Children were compelled to rely 
wholly upon it and hence lost the opportunity to acquire 
power to reason and to direct their own courses. 
In teaching arithmetic, the transition from authority 
to reason must be gradual. At first only very simple 
things can be comprehended, even with the aid of con- 
crete illustration and of motor activity. Counting is of 
necessity learned from authoritative statement, so
-P-A-G-E-136
    
130 What Children Study and Why 
must be many of the facts of notation. Names are 
largely arbitrary. But the names of numbers once 
learned, the simple combinations may be made plain by 
concrete illustration. A child must learn to count two, 
three, and five through being told the names of the 
combinations. But he can and should learn that two 
and three are five in quite a different way. This com- 
bination he must see for himself if his knowledge is to 
be real. 
With progress in power to reason, the value of au- 
thority gradually disappears and reason becomes more 
and more important. The child in the fifth grade may 
properly be told to divide one third by one half by in- 
verting the divisor and multiplying. In the grammar 
grades he should know why this method will avail. 
In general the inductive method is the ideal method 
for teaching arithmetic, but it must be used with dis- 
cretion. With young children, induction in mathe- 
matics requires, not. merely observations, but muscular 
effort and reaction. 
Concrete Presentation. — Take, for example, the al- 
ways difficult problem of “ carrying” in addition and 
“borrowing” in subtraction. It can be taught by rule, 
by illustration, or by use of the objects, but with 
23 very different results. Add 23 and 19. By rule 
1g We say 9+3=12, 1 ten and 2 units. Set down 
42 the 2 under units column, add the 1 to the tens 
in tens column =4. Some few children may 
comprehend this if’ tens and units have previously 
been taught concretely, not otherwise. But to most 
it is simply an order to be obeyed unquestioningly. 
This is the method of the older books and of many of
-P-A-G-E-137
  Arithmetic 131 
those in use to-day, and I venture to say that there are 
many teachers in the schools who, until in their maturity 
they began to teach, did not really comprehend the 
simple reason for “ carrying.” 
Another method is by illustration, rows of pictured 
objects in tens and units: 
ok ok KKK KKK KK 
ok 6 ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok KR 
ok oR ok ok ok ok ok kK 
3k KR OR RRR RK RE ee reek = CKKKKKK KKK AK 
KE FOR RR RK 
2tens, ~ 3 units = 
+1 ten, 9 units = 4 tens, 2 units 
3 tens, 12 units 
This unquestionably aids the comprehension, and more 
children will grasp the principle from this method than 
from the mere rule. But it is not the simplest or the 
most effective way. A very simple and easily procured 
material for concrete illustration is a box of sticks, such 
as are used in the kindergarten and in many primary 
schools. Wood toothpicks will do as well. Let the 
children tie up a hundred or more of the sticks in bundles 
of ten each (don’t do it for them), leaving a considerable 
number single. ; 
Then let them actually lay out the sticks, 2 bundles 
of 10 and 3 single sticks, and lay beside them one bundle 
of ro and 9 singles, making in all 3 bundles of 10 and 
12 single sticks. Have children tie up 10 of the singles 
into a new bundle and place it with the others, giving 
4 tens and leaving 2 ones. The operations with figures 
should be carried on simultaneously on the blackboard 
and by the children on paper. Simple as this may seem, 
it is psychologically and physiologically sound. The em-
-P-A-G-E-138
  
132 What Children Study and Why 
ployment of the motor activities and of the muscular sense 
strengthens and deepens the impression and aids in pro- 
ducing knowledge of the fact as distinguished from words. 
For subtraction reverse the process. This, too, must 
be accompanied by a demonstration of the operation 
with symbols. 
Possibly even a better material for the study of the 
periodic values of figures is real or imitation coins, cents 
and dimes and dollars, used in the making of change, to 
illustrate reduction of lower to higher, and the reverse. 
This foundation, once laid by the development of 
“ carrying” and “ borrowing” in addition and subtrac- 
tion, followed by sufficient practice to confirm the knowl- 
edge beyond the possibility of loss, serves for the entire 
structure of notation, including decimals, and for all the 
manipulations necessary under the four “ fundamental 
principles.” 
This preparatory work, whose purpose is to secure 
actual comprehension of the relations indicated by the 
positions of figures in numbers, must be followed, not 
preceded, by drill. 
Order of Presentation. — The order of presentation is 
this: First, a problem whose solution is carefully de- 
veloped by every means necessary to its full comprehen- 
sion. Then more problems of a similar sort, to be worked 
by the pupils, enough to clinch the instruction given 
and make it a factor in all future similar operations; 
then drill upon the abstract numbers used, to secure the 
desired automatic action. 
Drill Abstract. — Drill should be bare drill, unem- 
barrassed by terms or conditions or names not abso- 
lutely necessary to the statement of the problem in its
-P-A-G-E-139
  Arithmetic 133 
simplest form; that is, for drill, do not give problems 
upon so-called concrete numbers, but rather upon ab- 
stract, for instance, not such questions as: 
2 apples + 4 apples = ? apples. 
3 marbles — 2 marbles = ? marbles. 
6 X 3 boys = ? boys. 
Io girls + 2 = ? girls. 
but rather: 
2+4=? 
3-2=? 
6X3=? 
Io+2=? 
The addition of a name to a number does not really 
make it concrete, but it does embarrass the solution by 
introducing an element foreign and unnecessary. 
The application of these principles to fractions; to 
the study of lines, surfaces, and solids; to denominate 
numbers, and to monetary transactions, is evident. 
First develop the relations involved, and then drill 
until the memory will act mechanically. 
Care must be exercised not to go beyond the point of 
interest even in the later drill. The moment interest 
ceases, the drill becomes dead and is likely to do more 
harm than good. Minds interested and alert are the 
requisite of valuable drill. 
Limitations of the Concrete. — A caution is needed as 
to the limitations of the use of the concrete. Teachers 
sometimes develop subjects by means of sticks and 
squares and cubes and other schoolroom paraphernalia 
so continuously as not only to retard progress, but 
even to cause arrested mental development. The chil- 
dren have become so used to handling things to get
-P-A-G-E-140
  134 What Children Study and Why 
knowledge that their power to reason abstractly has 
been actually impaired. 
The object should be used to give a clear image, and as 
soon as this has been accomplished, should be discarded. 
Its only use is to lead to clear thinking. When the chil- 
dren are able to image the combinations and to think 
the processes without the material aid, its use should 
be discontinued at once. Some children can dispense 
with these aids sooner than others. The teacher must 
judge. For instance, in teaching the relations of terms in 
numeration, units to tens, tens to hundreds, etc., by the 
use of objects as outlined above for “ carrying” and 
“borrowing,” it will seldom be necessary to carry the 
method beyond tens. If the tenfold increase from units 
to tens is made perfectly clear, the corresponding in- 
creases to higher places will be comprehended by most 
children without the concrete illustration. A few may 
need to have hundreds developed. The ability to reason 
should be the reliance whenever possible. The material 
aid should be used only when needed. 
The above are merely typical instances, but the prin- 
ciples are of general application. If drill in all the 
simpler operations upon numbers were preceded by a 
thorough comprehension of the principles involved, and 
then were so abundant and of such character as to make 
those operations automatic and yet intelligent, we should 
have fewer complaints from business men that children 
nowadays cannot add. 
The important numbers in most operations are the 
small numbers, and the important combinations are the 
simpler ones. These are easily learned when once they 
are comprehended.

  CHAPTER XII 
ARITHMETIC 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION (Continued) 
In mathematics the child finds for the first time cer- 
tainty. Indeed, for the adult, mathematical fact is almost 
the only certainty, and mathematical reasoning is quite 
the only reasoning without an “if.” Its scope is com- 
paratively narrow, it is true, but its lines never vary. 
The school has no higher office toward the intellects 
of pupils than to teach them to “ reason justly.” How 
may arithmetic aid in this work? Mainly through two 
agencies: (1) the inductive method of approaching all 
new subjects, leading pupils to make their own generali- 
zations in the forms of definitions and rules of pro- 
cedure; and (2) the application of principles taught to 
the solution of vital problems, and, especially in the 
higher grades, through the use of the equation and of 
the literal symbol to represent the unknown quantity. 
In the older books the rule and the definition almost 
always were given at the beginning of all new topics. 
They rested on authority wholly. The reasoning power 
of the children was ignored and memory was the sole 
reliance, excepting in the application of the principle to 
the solution of problems, and even here the reasoning 
was only partial, the application to stated conditions of 
an uncomprehended rule or formula of procedure. To 
relieve this condition, Warren Colburn put forth his 
famous “ Mental Arithmetic,” which, with its imitators 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  136 What Children Study and Why 
and successors, accomplished great good, notwithstand- 
ing its excessive formalism. 
The Inductive Approach. — Illustrations of the induc- 
tive approach have already been given on pages 130, 
131 to show its use in developing facility and accuracy in 
the manipulation of numbers. Further illustrations are 
the following : 
Denominate numbers should be taught at first with 
the measure in hand. 
Fractions always present serious difficulties to chil- 
dren, which may easily be avoided by employing 
inductive instead of authoritative methods, while at 
the same time the pupils are being trained to think. 
If the three basal ideas of fractions are comprehended 
early by the pupils, all the later operations are com- 
paratively easy, and the work becomes training in 
thinking instead of the mere following of rules. I re- 
fer to the facts (1) that every fraction is an aliquot part 
of an indicated unit, either integral or fractional; 
(2) that every fraction is a statement of a ratio, 
the quotient of one number divided by another, and 
(3) that for purposes of calculation each fraction is 
itself a unit, or a stated number of units, according to 
its use. 
Some will doubtless say, ‘‘ Of course, we always teach 
these things.” Possibly, but the arithmetic books do 
not, at least, in such a way that the children grasp 
them, for to state them as they are stated here is not to 
teach them. On the contrary, to the ordinary child in 
school, fractions are a mystery not to be comprehended, 
and the only path through them is that of blind 
obedience to rule.
-P-A-G-E-143
  
Arithmetic 137 
The first of the principles is more commonly well 
taught than the others. Through handling objects, 
counting by 2’s, 3’s, etc., “wholing and parting,” dividing 
groups into smaller groups called halves, thirds, fourths, 
and the like, children in a modern primary school un- 
consciously acquire the notion that an aliquot part of 
any unit is a fraction. 
Still the fixed-unit absurdity is impressed upon the 
pupil when the book is reached, and $ becomes the myste- 
rious symbol of the unknowable. This is partly en- 
couraged by such falsities as “ compound fractions,” in 
which 4 of 3, the simplest statement of relation, as simple 
as 4 of 4, or 4 of 6 inches, is misstated in its very name 
“compound.” The remedy is of course to drop such mis- 
leading terms and return to the fact of relation, if neces- 
sary, using concrete objects, for example, slicing an apple 
into fractions of fractions. But whatever the means, the 
pupils should always be forced to keep in view the fact 
that a fraction is an aliquot part of the indicated unit, 
which may be any number, fractional or integral, and not 
merely one. The fact that a short method of finding 
4 of 3 is to multiply numerator by numerator and 
denominator by denominator should not be allowed 
to blind the children to the fact that the “ compound 
fraction” is a mere statement, one half of two thirds, 
which is one third. They should comprehend the rela- 
tion. 
The second principle is that a fraction is a statement 
of ratio. That is, 3 means not only two of the three 
parts into which 1 is divided (2 of a fixed unit), but 
one of the three parts into which 2 is divided ($ of 
the unit 2,—2 divided by 3).  
-P-A-G-E-144
  138 What Children Study and Why 
This can be made clear by much “ wholing and part- 
ing” ; first, of groups of objects, or of exactly measured 
dimensions, as inches, then of abstract numbers. It may 
be best to begin with easily divisible wholes, as 4’s or 6’s. 
Further practice will develop the truth that the ratios 
of numbers are not affected by the introduction of equal 
factors into both or by their removal from both, as: 
12, 127-3 
6 6+3.   
44 2. 2 x a1%3a5; 
Much drill, both concrete and abstract, upon such 
combinations will lead the pupil first to see the relations 
and then to comprehend the process. 
This imaging of the fundamental processes prepares 
the way for those more puzzling operations required for 
the addition, subtraction, and division of fractions. It 
makes possible the comprehension of the function of the 
common denominator, which usually is not compre- 
hended at all by the pupil who performs the operation 
by rule. 
As a further preparation for such operations, however, 
the third principle should be comprehended, namely, 
that each fraction is itself a unit, which can as readily 
be manipulated, increased, or diminished as an integer. 
In arithmetical calculation, } is as definite an entity 
as 1. This principle grows out of the second one, namely, 
that every fraction is a statement of ratio. It is most 
easily seen in improper fractions. Thus $ equal 2. 
The fraction is simply another way of expressing 2, 
and hence all the operations that may be performed 
upon 2 may likewise be performed upon $. Children 
can easily be led to see that in its nature 3 is similar to
-P-A-G-E-145
    Arithmetic 139 
4, although it has no integral equivalent. With these 
principles firmly in mind the difficulties of treating 
fractions disappear. 
For example, division of fractions is puzzling to most 
children. Even teachers sometimes are unable to see the 
reason for inverting the divisor and multiplying the frac- 
tions. Yet itis really as simple as addition to classes 
that have had the preliminary training outlined above. 
At least grammar school classes that have reached the 
formal study of fractions can easily image the process. 
For example: 
edatxdate= 
This by rule. The process is really as follows: 
GAS. aS 
4X3- ae   
3342 x4 Ae 3 3a: 4 
3 x4 both being the common denominator and showing 
by its structure how common denominators are made. 
Dividing the numerator of the dividend by that of the 
divisor, we have 
w Po ee 
SA ee   
s 
In other words, the rule merely indicates a short 
method of dividing, the common denominator being 
“ understood,” that is, eliminated from the actual work, 
though constructively present. 
Teaching to make Generalizations. — A process com- 
prehended is vastly more interesting to the pupil than 
one performed by rule merely, and what is more im- 
portant, it trains him to think for himself. There should, 
however, be both rules and definitions, but they should 
   
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 What Children Study and Why 
be formulated by the pupils themselves after observa- 
tion and manipulation. This cultivates that most im- 
portant of all reasoning powers, the power to generalize ; 
for definitions and rules are generalizations, having the 
especial advantage for beginners in the art of reasoning 
that they are certainties, not probabilities. 
After the children have done their best at construct- 
ing definitions and rules, it is well to compare the results 
of their efforts with the statements in the book, to make 
sure of accuracy, and to insure the best and most eco- 
nomical form of statement. 
If the work according to the inductive method at 
first seems slow, as compared with that under the rule, 
there need be no anxiety. Facility in later operations, 
due to a thorough understanding of the reasons for 
them, will much more than compensate for the earlier 
loss of time. 
The generalized truth is a great time-saver. When 
once comprehended, its use avoids the necessity of re- 
peating each time the process by which it has been 
reached. A child who has learned by observation the 
meaning of the word “ triangle ” is saved the necessity 
of describing it as a three-sided figure each time he 
would refer to it. 
Of course, it is important that the development of a 
principle should not be continued after the idea is once 
firmly grasped. The power to think should be utilized 
as rapidly as it is manifested. Otherwise there will be 
loss of time and interest, if not actual arrest of growth. 
Use of Unknown Quantity and Equation. — In order 
to save time and to insure the understanding of the 
processes, it is important that the unknown quantity 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  Arithmetic 141 
and the equation be introduced into the arithmetic 
quite early. The use of x for the unknown result is not 
difficult for grammar school pupils, and it opens the way 
to the time-saving processes which constitute one of the 
advantages of algebra over arithmetic. This, of course, 
both makes possible and requires the use of the equation. 
2 of 6 = 4 of what number? 
2 of 64 of x; ee, 60— 1205 015. 
oe o5 
This particular problem could more easily be solved 
by inspection and analysis; it merely illustrates the 
method which may be employed with more difficult 
problems. The « makes it possible to use the unknown 
result as if it were a known number in the equation. 
Thus the whole problem is clearly pictured and the 
process becomes visible to the mind’s eye. 
The preparation for the use of the equation should be 
made first by means of tangible objects, as a balance with 
weights, or a scale of inches and feet, showing that the 
two members may be increased or decreased by addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, or division to any extent, 
provided both be equally affected, for this is the entire 
secret of the manipulation of equations. But once 
really grasped, it makes easy the solution of many 
arithmetical problems, and best of all, it requires and 
develops the power to think, by establishing rational 
principles through rational processes. 
This phase of the cultural aim of arithmetic might be 
developed indefinitely, in application to the various 
topics. Especially might much be said of the orderly 
development of problems, stating them clearly and think- 
ing them through; but surely enough has been said to 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  142 What Children Study and Why 
make plain the contention that work in arithmetic 
should be work in thinking, and not merely the per- 
forming of operations according to rule. 
Enriching the Content.— The second phase of the 
cultural aim of the teaching of arithmetic is enriching 
the mental content, giving such knowledge of the 
physical and social world as may properly be given 
through this study. This was treated quite fully in 
Chapter X and need not be elaborated here. Suffice 
it to say: arithmetic must be taught as applied, 
to give both interest and practical value, and the 
choice of problems to illustrate principles supplies the 
opportunity for enriching the subject. Here is the weak- 
ness of most of the older textbooks. The problems are 
superannuated, disconnected, and unreal. 
Problems for Cultural Value.— A few simple prin- 
ciples may be stated as to the character of the problems 
to be used. 
(1) They should be vital. They should have a mean- 
ing to the children. They may be drawn from their im- 
mediate environment: from the home life, the school 
life, the games played, from the other subjects studied, 
as history, or geography, or manual training; from cur- 
rent events,—from any source of real and present interest. 
There are enough such problems available without re- 
sorting to the absurdities of the old books: ‘‘ When will 
the hound overtake the hare?” In addition to the 
problems in the book, children should be required to 
gather material and make many problems of their own 
from actual conditions: the cost of a dinner, the build- 
ing of a house or barn or rabbit hutch, the grading of a 
street, the profits of a newsboy. Their world is full of   
      
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  Arithmetic 143 
vital material for calculations of nearly all the sorts 
found in a good arithmetic. 
(2) There should be many connected problems, show- 
ing various relations. A series of real problems involv- 
ing many arithmetical processes is much more interest- 
ing and requires more consecutive thought than many 
separate problems employing the same operations, and 
it imparts a more realistic view of life. Its content is 
richer. 
For example, imagine a contractor figuring on the 
building of a house. Let the class draw the plans for 
the house to scale, doing their own measuring and cal- 
culating. Then let them take up the cost in detail: 
the excavation, walling, and flooring of the cellar, the 
building of the foundation, the lumber for the frame 
and covering, the flooring, plastering, and finishing of 
the interior, doors, and windows. Such a problem can 
be extended indefinitely, to include furnishing, for in- 
stance. The children should themselves make all the 
measurements and drawings, ascertain the current prices 
of all material, and estimate the total cost, including 
labor. The cost of the lot, and of such improvements 
as sewer, paving, and sidewalks may be added; also 
rental value. Or, the property may be sold for a partial 
cash payment and notes bearing interest. A fire may 
occur and damage be estimated and insurance con- 
sidered. 
The possibilities of such a series of problems are in- 
finite. Practically the whole field of arithmetic could 
be covered. The limits are to be fixed by the degree 
of advancement of the children and by interest. As 
soon as interest wanes, a new topic should be taken. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 What Children Study and Why 
For pupils unequal to such tasks simpler problems along 
similar lines may be used, as the laying out and planning 
of a school garden, the building of a trellis for vines, the 
making of kites and other toys. 
In the study of the really practical branches of the 
applications of percentage many interesting series of 
problems can be made that will give knowledge of civic 
conditions and of business methods. Under taxation, for 
example, local conditions should be found out by the 
children: the valuation, what percentage of actual 
value; the expenses of the various departments of the 
government as the basis for taxation; the fixing of the 
rate upon the assessed valuation; the taxes paid upon 
personal and real property; the amount paid by indi- 
viduals. (This last would better be imaginary.) 
While studying interest, it may be well to organize a 
bank in the school with toy money and go through with 
the operations, the children finding out by inquiry out- 
side how the business is carried on. 
Interesting and valuable problems may be taken from 
geography, using census reports and other available 
means of information; comparisons of cities and states 
in population, property valuation, business done in 
various lines, figured in ratios and percentages; length 
of journeys, miles of railroad and steamship lines; 
manufactures, agricultural products, especially local in- 
dustries, — all may be made to yield problems innumer- 
able, while acquainting pupils with the world they live 
on and in. The alert teacher will find-in the bustling, 
environing world an abundance of vital material for 
calculation. 
A few of the newer textbooks contain such problems
-P-A-G-E-151
  
Arithmetic 145 
and suggestions for more. These should be supple- 
mented by similar problems drawn from the immediate 
environment and experience of the school. 
The older books contain few such problems, if any. 
The teachers compelled to use these books should sub- 
stitute for their problems, in so far as possible, others 
drawn from present available sources. These sources 
include the school and home life of the children, current 
events in the larger world, and practically all the other 
subjects in the school curriculum. Care must be taken, 
however, always to keep within the limits of natural 
interest. Many dry statistical problems found in some 
of the newer arithmetics are as truly a weariness of the 
flesh as the worst of the senseless ones of the older books. 
Résumé. —I have endeavored to make plain how the 
teaching of arithmetic may be directed toward its three 
aims: (1) giving facility and accuracy in the use of 
numbers, (2) training the children to “ reason justly,” 
and (3) imparting such knowledge of the world and its 
life as is expressed largely in numerical terms. 
The first end is to be secured by developing in the 
natural order of thought the various processes and then 
drilling on the operations until the simpler ones become 
automatic. The second end is to be secured by seeing 
to it that all processes are thought through, substituting 
the inductive for the authoritative method of approach, 
and in the higher grades by the use of the symbol for 
the unknown quantity, and of the equation. The third 
end is to be secured incidentally, through choosing for 
illustration and practice such problems as are real, vital, 
and drawn largely from the field of the children’s 
knowledge and experience.
-P-A-G-E-152
  CHAPTER XIII 
History 
The First ‘“ Fad.” — History was the first of the 
“fads” to find a lodgment in our common school 
courses of study. Until the latter half of the nineteenth 
century the younger pupils in the elementary school 
studied reading, spelling, and arithmetic, and acquired 
the art of writing. In addition the older pupils studied 
grammar, and, later, geography was introduced. 
These subjects were justified from one or both of two 
motives, the “practical” and the “ disciplinary.” 
None of them were so taught as to be cultural in the 
broad sense. It is true, reading opened the door to the 
broadest culture and geography might have been used 
to bestow upon the children a wider horizon. But in 
fact, the practical and disciplinary uses of these subjects 
rather than their cultural possibilities constituted their 
justification and generally determined the method of 
instruction. It was not the province of the common 
school to busy itself with those finer phases of thought 
and feeling, that enlargement of view, that we call 
culture. 
Scant Culture. — Indeed, throughout the entire course 
of schooling, including the college, culture received scant 
courtesy. In the higher institutions discipline was the 
aim. Even the practical was not considered. The 
secondary schools were given over to Latin, Greek, and 
146
-P-A-G-E-153
History 147 
mathematics. And even these two ancient languages, 
which at the time of the Renaissance had brought to 
light an ancient culture and had established the new, 
had fallen from their high estate and had become mere 
disciplinary agents. The “Iliad” and the “‘AEneid ” were 
simply proofs of the rules of accent and prosody set 
forth in the grammars. The “ Anabasis”’ illustrated ad- 
mirably the adverbial accusative. ‘ Caesar’s Commen- 
taries” were perfect models of indirect discourse. 
The colleges continued these disciplinary studies and 
added metaphysics in the subjects of logic, psychology, 
philosophy, and ethics with a theological squint. But 
in the latter part of the century came a great awakening, 
and history, the natural sciences, English literature, 
modern languages, the arts, entered with a rush until 
the curriculum became an overcrowded jumble, an un- 
arranged syncope of human learning, out of which 
gradually, by correlation, by excision, by selection, an 
orderly educational course of study is coming, which 
will be practical, disciplinary, and rich. 
In the common elementary schools history was the 
first innovation, a study not practical in the Gradgrind 
sense, and, as taught, not possessing great disciplinary 
value. It was informing and had a decided ethical pur- 
pose. Indeed it is to this latter. function that its rapid 
extension in our schools was doubtless due. 
History and the Civil War. — The sudden popularity 
of history was coincidental with the close of our great 
Civil War. Naturally and properly the history taught 
was the history of the United States. The intensity of 
feeling roused over our great conflict created a strong 
desire to train the youth to patriotism. -Those who had  
-P-A-G-E-154
  148 What Children Study and Why 
borne a part in the struggle naturally desired that 
their descendants be familiar with it in all its details of 
cause and execution. Naturally, too, the importance 
of a knowledge of the other great events of our national 
life was realized, and so it very quickly became a law in 
most States that the schools should teach the history 
of the United States. 
A New Motive. — Thus the principle was established 
that public schools were directly concerned with citizen- 
ship as such. From this the step to the introduction of 
other subjects that are highly educational, and that 
tend to produce citizens richly furnished with all that 
makes for larger life, was logical and easily taken. 
War in Earlier Histories. — The earlier histories for 
schools were little more than chronicles of dates and rec- 
ords of wars. The Civil War was the most conspicuous 
event and was treated in minute detail. Infants were 
set to judging of military campaigns. Sectional par- 
tisanship was everywhere manifest. In the North the 
southern contestants were wicked “ Rebels.” In the 
South the northern contestants were unprincipled, in- 
vading “ Yanks.” 
Next to the Civil War the War of the Revolution filled 
the most space. Here, too, an exaggerated patriotism 
ruled; the wicked red-coated British were everywhere 
whipped by the brave, virtuous patriots. Right was all 
on one side, wrong all on the other. 
Marking an Epoch. — However defective the books 
and however biased the teaching, the introduction of 
history into our elementary schools marked an epoch. 
It was a definite admission by the taxpayer and voter, 
the financial supporter of public schools, that these
-P-A-G-E-155
  
History 149 
schools could properly provide instruction in subjects 
on other grounds than their economic value or their 
disciplinary effect. It was the first distinct admission 
by the public school authorities of the duty or even the 
right of these schools to take cognizance of the demands 
of the higher natures of children. Compared with this 
great step, inferior method and doubtful results are of 
little consequence. Indeed most of the broadening and 
enriching subjects have come into the curriculum limp- 
ing, to be cured afterward. 
Better Books and Methods. — Both textbooks on 
history and methods of teaching it have greatly improved. 
Some of the more recent textbooks have the genuine mer- 
its of accuracy and of a readable, interesting style. The 
methods used depend, of course, upon the skill and wis- 
dom of the teacher. Most of the textbooks offer little 
help in this regard. In addition to the textbooks there 
are several history books for children, some of which 
are used to supplement the textbooks, that are worthy 
of commendation. 
Limits of the Course. — At the present time, in most 
elementary schools, the history of the United States is 
taught from a two-book series, frequently supplemented 
by “stories”? of men and events. It is the exception 
to find any other history in these schools. In the high 
schools “ general history ” is taught in chunks from a 
compendium ; in the better schools it is expanded and 
supplemented by reading. History of the United States 
is here too often either hastily reviewed or entirely 
ignored. In the college, history is largely a matter of 
specialization. So that it is quite possible for a graduate 
from a first-class college to have received no instruction
-P-A-G-E-156
  150 What Children Study and Why 
in the history of his own country except the very small 
amount of predigested information given in the grammar 
school. Thisisno mere guess. Any community and any 
school system can produce college graduates who have the 
vaguest notions, if they have any at all, of the differences 
between Hamilton and Jefferson, or just why the war 
with Mexico was fought. This truly is an unhappy state. 
Reasonable Demands. —JIs it unreasonable to ask 
that children who have completed a grammar school 
course should be very familiar with the leading facts 
of our national development, territorial, industrial, 
political, and social, with, as a background, a little 
knowledge of the other great nations of the past and 
present, especially of the world-renowned names that are 
significant of the evolution of civilization; that high 
school graduates should have a fairly definite knowledge 
of the great men and great nations of history and a pretty 
thorough acquaintance with the manifest noteworthy 
events of American history, and also some knowledge 
of the metaphysical, commercial, social, or ethical motives 
that caused them; that college graduates should have 
a quite clear view of the philosophy of history with a 
thorough knowledge of at least one epoch or phase or 
nation besides our own, and also a definite and philo- 
sophical familiarity with the doctrines and the passions 
that have made American history ? 
Why Results are Poor. —If this is not an extreme 
demand, it is one of which the present state offers little 
even of promise. For the average student who passes 
through our school system from kindergarten to college, 
not one of these conditions is met. Why? In the ele- 
mentary schools, because of a method, imposed by au-
-P-A-G-E-157
  
History I51 
thorities and textbooks, compounded of ignorance and 
tradition. In the secondary schools, because of a shilly- 
shally vibration between devotion to a compendious 
textbook on the one hand and an aping of university 
specialization on the other. In the colleges, because 
of extreme specialization under an elective system and 
of sheer poor teaching, — the great defect of all our col- 
leges, — in this instance, a taking for granted knowledge 
that does not exist and a foolish rushing into “ original 
investigation,” before laying a foundation in knowledge 
of the broad facts of history and of the great world move- 
ments. 
What to Do. — What can be done about it? As this 
book is concerned chiefly with the elementary schools, 
I shall not attempt now to discuss the teaching of history 
in higher schools, except in the briefest suggestions. 
What should the elementary school attempt in history, 
and how? 
Need of General History. — Unquestionably the history 
of our own country should be paramount here. But 
this does not mean that the history of other nations 
should be ignored. A knowledge of some phases of 
world history is necessary to a comprehension of our 
own national life. Even children need a background 
for their pictures. There is no knowledge without com- 
parison. If a basis for comparison is not supplied in 
facts, the children will of necessity create one from the 
imagination. We need patriotism, yet a patriotism not 
narrow and ignorant, but broad and intelligent. This 
is stimulated by a knowledge of our country’s struggles, 
of its heroes and of its triumphs, not viewed alone, how- 
ever, but rather in comparison with the heroes, the strug-
-P-A-G-E-158
  
152 What Children Study and Why 
gles, the triumphs, and defeats of other peoples. The 
older pupils, as they begin to grasp the philosophical 
causes that lie back of all our history, need more and 
more this comparison with the history of other times and 
nations. Hence in all grades there should be presented 
judicious selections of universal history as well as the his- 
tory of our own nation, particularly of those phases and 
events of universal history that were both the prelude 
and the cause of our own national origin and develop- 
ment. 
Aims of Teaching History. — What are the aims of 
instruction in history ? 
First, the development of intelligent patriotism. 
Second, to furnish a basis for ethical judgment obtained 
from a study of the efforts of men to realize their ideals, 
the obstacles they have met, and the success or failure 
attending these efforts, with reasons for such success or 
failure. 
Third, the broadening of the mind and the widening 
of the horizon that necessarily follow a knowledge of 
human activities on a large field and under many vary- 
ing conditions. 
Fourth, a sense of the uniformity of human motives, 
of the solidarity of the race, of the dependence of the 
present upon the past, — the evolution of civilization 
through the action of universal, constant forces, — and 
a belief in the brotherhood of man. 
Naturally the possible appreciation of these motives 
will vary with the age and intellectual capacities of the 
children. But even the higher aims should be in the 
minds of teachers of all grades, and some impressions 
yegarding them can be made upon even the quite young
-P-A-G-E-159
  History : 153 
and immature. Of necessity the paramount aim for the 
younger children will be patriotism, as broadly intelli- 
gent as their mental states allow. This requires, as has 
been said, some knowledge of those great names and 
important events of world history that serve as a back- 
ground for our own history. 
To secure the ends outlined, what material should be 
used and how should it be treated, first with the quite 
young children, second with those older ? 
As preliminary to this discussion it is necessary to 
consider two debatable questions. 
Place of Chronology. — The first concerns the chrono- 
logical order of events. Is it best to follow this order 
in teaching history to young children? 
The importance of the chronological order is, of course, 
the relation of cause to effect. It is impossible to havea 
comprehensive or philosophical view of an epoch or even 
an event without a knowledge of what has gone before. 
For instance, the French Revolution as a tale of un- 
governed passions and mob violence may be sufficient to 
itself, but its real significance is lost unless it is prefaced 
by a view of the previous history, not only of France, but 
of Europe. The wider the knowledge of what went be- 
fore, the more significant is the story of this era of blood 
and fury, and knowledge of both the revolution and its 
causes is necessary to a comprehension of the Napoleonic 
era. : 
Our own Revolution is almost meaningless without 
acquaintance, not only with the earlier colonial history, 
but with European conditions as well. 
This consideration determines the importance of the 
chronological order in teaching history in high school and   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    
154 What Children Study and Why 
college, in the latter especially as a necessary condition 
to specialization. But we cannot hope to give young 
children a philosophical or comprehensive view of even 
those occurrences that they may study with interest and 
profit. At first we can give them only simple and in- 
dividual impressions. The only causes that they can 
comprehend are present and manifest causes. Chronol- 
ogy means little toa child. To him “Once upon a time” 
is as definite as “In the eighteenth century,” and “Long, 
long ago” as “ Fifty years ago.”’ He has no compre- 
hension of long periods of time. The child in the primary 
grades can understand that once his grandfather’s grand- 
father, and other people who lived in this country at that 
time, thought they were not fairly treated and were not 
willing to be ruled by people across the ocean, who made 
them pay taxes without giving them an opportunity to 
say anything about it, and so they made Washington 
their general, fought these rulers, drove them out and 
elected their own rulers. He can understand that La- 
fayette and other Frenchmen came over and helped them. 
But he cannot understand the deep significance of this 
rebellion or the political condition of Europe which made 
success possible. 
For the very young children, history should be re- 
duced to stories of heroes without much regard for the 
order of events. 
The Psychological Order.— Moreover, there is a 
psychological relation of conditions and events, often 
quite remote from their chronological order. There is 
doubtless a certain amount of truth in the “ development 
epoch” theory, which is, briefly, that each child during 
his mental growth passes through the various stages that
-P-A-G-E-161
  
History 155 
the race has passed through in the process of its evolu- 
tion; that, for example, he becomes in turn a savage, a 
nomad, and the rest. At least there is proof enough in — 
this theory to justify the presentation at the same time 
of phases of history that are similar to one another and 
correspond somewhat to the present state of the child, 
without regard to their chronological order. 
“The childhood of the race ” is not merely a distant 
state to be studied in monuments and ancient heroic 
poems; it is an ever present fact. As far back as history 
goes there were living, side by side, nations in a state of 
advanced civilization sloping toward decay, and savages, 
as well as people just emerging into a semi-civilization. 
The racial childhood portrayed in Homer existed at the 
same time with the old and mature civilization of Egypt 
and nations farther east. When Rome was declining 
toward her fall, the Germanic peoples were just begin- 
ning to look forward to their toga virilis. 
And it is so to-day. We have all stages, from ancient 
and decadent Persia, through the declining Latin races, 
the vigorous adult Saxon peoples, the young, unde- 
veloped, but advancing Russian nation, the childish 
Filipino, to the African savage, yet in swaddling clothes. 
Hence stories of peoples in a state of racial childhood 
may be obtained from any age, and for the purposes for 
which such stories are profitable, the era makes little 
difference. A group of stories of primitive heroes taken 
from many nations in as many ages is quite as good for 
ethical ends as one taken from a single age. And one 
order of arrangement is practically as good as another. 
The best way to inculcate patriotism is not always to 
tell of our own heroes alone, and of their successful ex-  
-P-A-G-E-162
  156 What Children Study and Why 
ploits against their foes, but to give stories of brave men 
who did brave deeds in war or peace, who made sacrifices, 
who lived good lives for their country, whatever that 
country was. Buddha, Aristides, Horatius, Gustavus, 
Tell, Winkelried, Garibaldi, Toussaint, Gladstone, plus 
Washington, Lincoln, and our other national heroes, 
make a better list for this purpose than our heroes alone, 
and in such a list for such a purpose chronology cuts no 
figure. 
Chronology subordinated in Primary Schools. — In 
the primary schools the orderly teaching of history may 
easily be overdone, and the very end we seek be lost by 
an attempt to force chronology upon the children before 
they are ready for it. In the primary schools, then, 
where history is taught almost wholly for its ethical 
value, chronology should receive the slightest attention, 
and that should be confined wholly to the history of the 
United States. In the general history stories used in the 
grades no regard should be paid to the time order. 
Relations that Primary Children can Grasp. — Chil- 
dren, such as are found in the average primary school, can 
have slight conception of the relations of effects to re- 
mote causes. The effects must be immediate and glar- 
ing for them. Moreover, psychological relations are 
much more easily grasped than geographical or political 
relations. 
Injustice calls for immediate resistance, or poetic 
justice. Sudden danger calls for bravery. Moral emer- 
gencies demand moral courage. Suffering is cause for 
pity and help. “ Freedom to worship God ” is reason 
enough for the coming of the Pilgrims. The long, com- 
plex struggle of creeds and the contests of clerical and
-P-A-G-E-163
  History 157 
civil powers which were the remote causes of the pil- 
grimage are meaningless to children. The noble triumph 
of Joseph teaches its own lesson and satisfies the instinct 
for poetic justice, whereas the ceaseless struggle of a 
commercial race against both the agricultural and the 
military, which the history of the Jews in Egypt really 
typifies, is for adults only. General Putnam riding down 
the perilous steps is picturesque and inspiring to children, 
and requires neither time relations nor philosophy to give 
it force. So the immortal story of Sir Philip is worth 
more to primary children than the list of England’s 
sovereigns ‘in order duly set.” 
All of these historical tales rest for their interest upon 
a psychological motive. The relation of effect to cause is 
direct, immediate, and manifest. Hence, they are good 
stories to serve as an introduction to history. Groups 
of such stories, selected and arranged with regard to the 
natural development of children’s interests, with an 
ethical rather than a political or an informing purpose, 
and giving especial attention to the history of our own 
national life, constitute the best material for history 
teaching in the primary grades. 
In the Grammar Grades. — In the grammar grades, 
naturally, increasing attention should be paid to the 
sequential order. The history of the United States may 
here be presented chronologically. But even in these 
grades, care must be taken not to overwork chronology. 
The earlier ethical motive has not been outlived. Nor 
have the children suddenly become able to appre- 
ciate the historical succession of events as explained by 
social philosophy. 
In general history the psychological order still is better
-P-A-G-E-164
  158 What Children Study and Why 
than the time order. An orderly knowledge of world 
history is as yet beyond the children. 
In the higher grammar grades, then, while the study of 
the history of our country may be pursued strictly in the 
order of events, general history should still be taught 
chiefly in selected incidents or series of incidents. Bi- 
ography may give way to a considerable degree to the 
stories of great epochs, treated in an orderly manner so as 
to emphasize increasingly the relations of these events to 
consequences less immediate than those formerly con- 
sidered. Geographical motives, such, for example, as the 
effect of mountain barriers between nations, and certain 
political motives, such as desire of conquest, may be in- 
troduced. The history of England and of certain other 
European nations as related to the settlement of America 
should be given with some fullness. Especially should 
the history of England as it bears upon the struggle for 
independence receive quite full and orderly treatment. 
Without such a background it is impossible to under- 
stand the birth and childhood of the American nation. 
In the High Schools. — In the high school the chrono- 
logical order should rule, to make plain the dependence 
of the development of each age upon the preceding, and 
to give that enlargement of vision which constitutes one 
of the chief values of the study of history. 
In the Colleges. — In the college the study should be, 
of course, chronological, but it should be more. It 
should be philosophical and should give the student an 
insight into the deeper human motives of action, out of 
which grow ideals, moral judgment, and an appreciation 
of the relations of both to individual conduct and to the 
progress of humanity,
-P-A-G-E-165
        CHAPTER XIV 
History (Continued) 
Tue second of the preliminary questions to be discussed 
is the place of biography in the teaching of history. 
Should history be taught to children as a series of great 
events, the evolution of an ever changing society, or 
as centering about the lives of significant men? Shall 
we follow Freeman or Carlyle in our teaching? 
Nature of History.— Naturally this inquiry raises 
the larger question of what history is. Is it a narrative 
of evolution due to countless unconscious forces, geo- 
graphical, psychological, social, or is it the record of 
master minds controlling their fellows and consciously 
leading to determined ends? This is too great a ques- 
tion for discussion here, except as it touches the teach- 
ing of history to the young. Indeed, it can be answered 
only by a compromise statement. History is doubtless 
the result of both conscious and unconscious forces. 
Geographical conditions, the forces of earth, air, and sky, 
affecting man’s physical wants and their gratification ; 
psychological conditions — the aspirations of men and 
the consequent struggles to satisfy them; social condi- 
tions— the relations of men with men, governed by love 
or hate, need or greed, the never ceasing battle between 
those who would enslave and those who would be free, 
— these are great forces, and without doubt they largely 
determine the activities of individuals, and hence of 
nations and of races. 
159
-P-A-G-E-166
  160 What Children Study and Why 
On the other hand, great and significant movements 
must have leaders. And not only so, these movements 
sometimes are personified in the leaders, without whom 
they never would have occurred, because the masses 
would not even have known their needs or have had the 
desire to change. 
It is impossible to conceive the Jewish exodus and long 
wandering without Moses. In an unusual sense Gari- 
baldi was Free Italy, and Mohammed was the fanatical, 
bloody, conquering Moslem host. 
In the college, the teaching of history should treat 
fully both these sources of historic movements, and also 
should train the student to discriminate causes. The 
philosophic view, which is the proper college view of the 
subject, includes of necessity both conscious or personal 
forces and those greater unconscious motives which may 
be called cosmic; and this view is necessary to the ma- 
ture student. 
History for the Child. — How is it with the child? 
What is the relation of these broad views of the 
subject to the ends of teaching history to him, as 
enumerated in the preceding chapter: ethical training, 
— especially in patriotism, — moral judgment, and cul- 
ture? 
Moral Judgment Personal. — To the immature mind 
all moral states and judgments are strictly personal. 
Indeed, this is true of most older people. Few of us can 
conceive abstract moral conditions as applied to national 
life or even corporate life. When we do try to picture 
the moral characteristics of the action of a mass, we unify 
the mass and make a single magnified individual. With 
children this is especially true. 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
      161    History 
The Culture Element. The element that we call 
culture is not confined to mature minds, of course, but in 
immature minds necessarily it is immature, — the “ ever 
flowing.” It is an intangible, almost volatile, product 
of experiences that to the individual are rich. If the 
individual be a child, the experiences must be childish, 
and the resulting culture childish. Any system of educa- 
tion that tends to secure mature views and the expression 
of mature judgments from children is distorting, shallow, 
and harmful. It makes prigs, and fattens that conceit 
that is necessarily a bar to growth. 
Danger of Generalizations. — The most common form 
of this particular evil in our schools is thrusting into the 
mouths of children those sweeping generalizations that 
of necessity they must take entire or not at all. This 
is most manifest in the ordinary way of teaching morals, 
giving children those half truths that are commonly stated 
in proverbs, and expecting them to base moral judgments 
upon them. Moral precepts given in the ordinary 
allopathic doses are responsible for much real immorality. 
The bearing of all this upon the subject in hand is this. 
Generalization is the last product of thought upon a series 
of phenomena. Along the route from the first observa- 
tion to the generalization are thousands of pitfalls. 
Even trained minds often fall into one or more of these. 
Witness all the strange, discarded theories of science, 
from that of the earth resting on a turtle’s back to that 
of the hot polar sea. 
In history it is especially difficult to form clear con- 
ceptions of the motives and causes of great movements 
as such. The crusades and the world-wide emancipation 
movement were due to so many mixed motives that   
-P-A-G-E-168
   
           162 What Children Study and Why 
generalization with the eyes shut is far easier than scien- 
tific analysis. 
When such master minds as Hegel and Lecky go astray 
in attempts to synthesize movements involving the heart- 
beats, the appetites, the prejudices, the passions, of 
millions of individuals, and to treat of their combined 
activities as a single force, what can be expected of the 
ordinary mind, and especially of a child’s mind? 
In physics, the resultant of many forces may be ac- 
curately measured; not so in metaphysics. But this is 
what history, considering great national or racial move- 
ments, assumes todo. This is the philosophy of history, 
and hard as it is, it is proper effort for the human mind 
to study man, not merely in the individual, but in the 
mass composed of individuals. I pursue a certain course 
each day from mixed motives. My ninety million 
neighbors do likewise. The resultant of these ninety 
million and one courses of action constitutes the history 
of the United States at the present time. It shapes all 
policies, fixes all compromises, is responsible for. all good 
and all evil that come into our national life, and from it 
into each individual life. But.to determine what this 
resultant is and to state it clearly is not so easy. Few 
succeed in doing it. Only the historian long removed 
from its passions, with the perspective of distance, can 
hope to approximate a true conception of it. But this 
is history, and the mind trying to grasp it receives a 
training, a culture, that few studies can supply. The 
young child, however, who thinks as a child, under- 
stands as a child, cannot touch it. If we force it upon 
him, he gets mere words. For him, motive is individual, 
actions and results are individual, history is individual,
-P-A-G-E-169
  History 163 
Carlyle rather than Freeman. — It follows that in order 
to secure the ends aimed at in teaching history to children, 
the doctrine of Carlyle, rather than that of Freeman, 
should rule in the main. The study of history by chil- 
dren should be largely the study of heroes, individuals 
who loom large, who appeal to the imagination, who may 
become ideals. In time Lincoln and Lee will come to 
personify all that was greatest and best in the contrasting 
ideals that fought to a finish in our Civil War; and to 
children it is much better that they should be so pre- 
sented and studied, than that time should be consumed in 
learning the details of military campaigns, now of im- 
portance only to the professional soldier. 
Other Centers of Study. — This general statement may 
be modified to a certain extent. Sometimes a single great 
and picturesque event, such as the battle of Bunker Hill 
or the signing of the Declaration of Independence, may 
make a better central study than the name of any indi- 
vidual. The important truth is that individual narrative, 
with all the definiteness, positiveness, and picturesque 
detail of a novel, is better history for children than either 
the chronicle or the philosophical generalization of the 
“ sweep of events.” 
Subjects must be Vital. — In the primary schools it 
makes little difference in what ages the scenes of the 
narrative are laid, so long as they are “‘ once upon a time.” 
But the subjects must be vital, and must have a direct 
bearing upon one or more of the ends for which history 
is taught, and the story must be vivid and convincing. 
In the grammar schools, along with a somewhat more 
orderly treatment of the subject, events as such may re- 
ceive fuller consideration. Not only may causal time
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  164. What Children Study and Why 
sequences begin to appear in the course, but to a degree 
the hero may give place to the group, the “‘ Black Knight, 
with his single lance,” to the army following its leader. 
But the general method may not be changed. The time 
has not come for much generalization, nor for the syn- 
thesizing of individual acts into the acts of masses. The 
fields studied must still be small and easily scanned. The 
individual must still be paramount. 
The Local Center.— There must always be a local 
center of interest of major significance, about which events 
and personalities of minor consequence naturally group 
themselves. Such centers may be the names of great 
leaders, as Richard of the Lion Heart, the names of places, 
as Runnymede, or single important events like the Dred 
Scott decision, or even wider movements, provided 
they are definite and picturesque, like the ‘“ Children’s 
Crusade.”’ But they must be real centers, significant and 
suggestive, and they must be so selected that they will 
surely find apperceiving centers in the children’s minds to 
welcome them, and then will create new centers. In the 
choice of such events the rules as to chronology laid down 
in the preceding chapter should be heeded. Remember 
that in the grammar school the chronological order of 
American history may be followed with some closeness, 
but in general history it is still of slight consequence. 
In these grades the advance in logical thinking and in 
the comprehension of causal relations should receive 
recognition rather in the selection of central subjects and 
in the grouping of related events and persons about these, 
than in the chronological order. 
Take, for example, the characters and the events that 
center about the name of Queen Elizabeth. Many events
-P-A-G-E-171
  History 165 
of sufficient significance in themselves to serve as topics 
for volumes of history find in the unique personality of 
the “ Virgin Queen ”’ a center at once unifying and pic- 
turesque. For the young student just opening his eyes 
to the relations of history, better than the chronological 
order, better than the logical sequence of events, is this 
single striking individual. Bacon and the birth of 
modern science, Raleigh and the early settlements of 
the New World, Shakespeare and the literary flood, 
Queen Mary and the Spanish Armada, with all the con- 
fused struggles of churches and states, —a morass in 
which the youth is so easily lost, — all these seem to solve 
themselves in the person of the queen. At least the 
young student who is taught to group them all about her 
gets a clear picture of events and their relations that 
is quite sufficient for his needs, and vastly more satis- 
factory than any other possible view. 
In all grades, at least below the college, the choice of 
centers of historical interest is of the utmost importance, 
greatly transcending that of chronological sequence. 
Grouping occurrences about a logical center avoids both 
the scrappiness of disconnected stories and the tedium 
of chronology. It secures perspective and balance, 
which both the other methods lack. 
Need of Discrimination. — A most important corollary 
to the above advocacy of the use of centers of interest 
in teaching history is the need of discrimination in re- 
gard to what to teach. Perhaps the chief objection 
to the chronological sequence is the deadly monot- 
ony due to the lack of discriminating emphasis. This is 
especially noticeable in those compendiums of histor- 
ical facts that commonly serve as “ school histories.”
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 What Children Study and Why 
Nothing stands out. All events are reduced to the dead 
level of the chronicle. The date is “ the thing,” and each 
date must receive its appropriate tag, all of equal size 
and of the same color. This is historical impartiality 
with a vengeance. If any one thinks this stricture ex- 
aggerated, let him select any six school histories and try 
to read them. If this does not result in a loss of historical 
perspective, it will be because the soporific qualities of 
the books save him. 
The Good Story. — Few historians, even the great 
ones, can tell a good story, and those who do succeed in 
this are likely to be accused by their rivals of being 
“literary rather than scientific,” — Macaulay, for ex- 
ample. Be this as it may, I have no doubt that the 
historian who can tell a good story, still keeping within 
the metaphysical bounds of truth, is the one who will 
find the readers and will exert the widest and most 
beneficial influence. Herodotus and Xenophon were 
good story tellers. So were Livy and Cesar and Tacitus. 
So in later times have been Froude, Macaulay, Pres- 
cott, Parkman, and John Fiske, not to mention other 
conspicuous examples. 
At any rate, and especially for children, history must 
be story, and the writers of history for schools should tell 
stories, instead of being, as they are in the main, the 
dullest of chroniclers. Scott’s ‘‘ Tales of a Grandfather,” 
not to mention his novels, the much-derided Dickens’ 
“Child’s History of England,’ Hawthorne’s ‘“ Grand- 
father’s Chair,” and— yes, don’t gasp—J. S. C. 
Abbott’s once widely read histories have done more to 
arouse interest in the study of history and to stimulate 
ideals among the young than all the “ school histories ”
-P-A-G-E-173
  
History 167 
ever written. Call them by your pet opprobrious epi- 
thet if you will; they have been undisguised blessings, 
and I doubt not that an honest confession would dis- 
close the fact that most of the readers of this article who 
are really interested in history got their earliest enthu- 
siasm from one or more of these books. 
Importance of Selection.— These books, and others 
that have the secret of story telling, discriminate between 
the important and the unimportant. With unerring 
judgment they choose the single significant and pictur- 
esque persons, events, times, places, or objects, and ar- 
range dramatic plots about them; and this is what the 
teacher must do who would make his work vital and 
lasting. 
Don’t try to teach everything. Have the courage of 
your convictions and spend your time in developing a 
few central ideas with considerable fullness, so as to give 
the historical sense and raise the subject out of the plane 
of mere memory. 
Choose the Inspiring. — Not only must discrimination 
be practiced regarding the political importance and pic- 
turesqueness of events, but choice, in so far as possible, 
should favor those occurrences that are likely to prove 
helpful toward the higher moral ends of teaching his- 
tory. Civilization, properly presented, is more inspiring 
than barbarism, peaceful achievements than war, free- 
dom than tyranny. 
Greatness of Peace. — Especially should strong efforts 
be made to arouse interest in the arts of peace rather 
than those of war. This will not always be easy. 
History, as written, is too mucha record of wars 
and. too little of the achievements of peace. From
-P-A-G-E-174
  
  168 What Children Study and Why 
one point of view this is not unnatural. War is 
picturesque, and appeals to the admiration for the 
heroic always present in the minds of the young. 
These elements are often lacking in the records of 
peace. Hence it is more difficult to write a history 
that shall record the progress of civilization in times of 
peace and at the same time supply the elements of in- 
terest, picturesqueness, and heroic conduct essential to 
a history for the young. Such a history requires greater 
skill in both the writer and the teacher. But this fact 
should not deprive the children in the schools of the ad- 
vantages to be gained from acquaintance with the higher 
ideals. 
War may not be Ignored. — It is not to be inferred from 
this, however, that war is to be either ignored or slightly 
treated in school histories. That would be an error 
perhaps even more serious than the prevailing one. War 
is unfortunately a great and conspicuous fact in history, 
whose influence on the world’s progress has been beyond 
calculation. It has produced the highest heroism as 
well as the grossest brutality. It shows men at their 
best and at their worst. No history would be even ap- 
proximately complete which failed to give due prominence 
to the great struggles for liberty or even to the wars of 
conquest, or which failed to make much of great military 
heroes. ‘In a general way the great wars of the world’s 
history show the great aims for which men were strug- 
gling; they show the climaxes of historic epochs. 
My contention is for a better balancing of values. The 
great movements, conquests, and heroes of peace should 
receive their due share of attention. Not merely the 
military leaders, but the leaders of thought, of ideals, of
-P-A-G-E-175
  History 169 
the arts, of commerce, of manufacture, of finance, should 
be accorded the distinction that their greatness deserves. 
In this country we have had four great wars and 
several minor ones. They have developed heroes, and 
two of them especially have been fundamental to our 
development as a nation. But they have occupied in all 
but a few years of time. All the other years of our cen- 
tury and a quarter have been filled with the struggles 
and the conquests of peace. They, too, have developed 
heroes, and through them our greatness has been attained. 
So they should receive by far the larger share of space 
in our histories. That this is not the case, even the 
most casual examination of current school histories will 
show. 
Need of Grouping. — What is needed is to bring out 
the greatness of these conquests of peace by a careful, 
logical, and picturesque grouping of their records about 
suitable centers of interest, either persons or events. 
The growth of a great city like New York or Chicago 
may well serve as such a center, for the great cities are 
ganglia of nerves that reach to every part of the land, 
and in their growth and its causes is bound up the 
growth of the country. Such inventions as the cotton 
gin, the telegraph, the steam engine, and other means 
of communication, may also well serve as centers for 
great groups of attendant and dependent facts. 
It should be always kept in mind that peaceful growth 
is the ultimate hope of history, that all men, even soldiers, 
look forward to the time when “ nation shall not lift up 
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any 
more.” 
The movement toward permanent peace among the 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  170 What Children Study and Why 
nations, though still in its beginning, is yet the most 
significant fact of the present era. The “ federation of 
the world ” should be kept before all minds as the highest 
ideal of history. To this noble end the schools can con- 
tribute by making the events and the heroes of peace 
' appear to the children in their true light, as even greater 
than those of war. 
Summary. —1. History in our schools should be 
mainly biography. 
2. It should include both American and “ general ” 
history. 
3. In the primary schools, chronology should be dis- 
regarded. In the grammar schools the American history 
taught should follow chronology moderately. General 
history should give little attention to it. In the higher 
schools chronological relations assume increasing im- 
portance. 
4. History, whether chronological or not, should be 
taught about carefully chosen, picturesque centers of 
interest — persons, places, significant events or objects. 
5. Discrimination should be exercised in choosing what 
to teach. The dead level of the chronicle should be 
avoided. 
6. The highest ideals should be kept to the fore. 
Peace should appear as greater than war.

CHAPTER XV 
GEOGRAPHY 
Geography a Conglomerate.— Geography, “as she is 
taught,” is a strange composite of subjects, including, 
besides the sciences, a little history, a little philosophy, 
politics, sociology, anthropology, religion, and literature, 
which with more or less reason from time to time have 
been grouped about the name. Asa “ Description of the 
Earth,” it is made to include all that is in it, on it, or 
about it. The earth may be studied as a member of the 
solar system; as a geological product; as a sphere hay- 
ing an irregular surface, partly land, partly water, in 
various forms and presenting various appearances; as 
the abode and support of life, both vegetable and animal, 
varying according to the above-mentioned conditions ; 
as the home of man, supplying him with his support and 
partly, at least, determining his character and his pur- 
suits; and as the scene of human history and the present 
ground of human effort, divided among the nations of the 
world, according to race, intelligence, power, and other 
conditions. Each one of these subjects is a vast one. 
Yet they all have been first amplified and then squeezed 
into the compass of a school textbook for the consumption 
of children. 
In its present state geography is an almost hopeless 
subject. The doctors disagree. No two authors of text- 
books take the same view as to what should be taught. 
17z 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
    172 What Children Study and Why 
Naturally enough the teachers are at sea, and the result 
in school is too often altogether barren. 
Selection Needed. — What is most needed is a wise 
and workable plan of selection and coérdination. But 
unfortunately most of the experts who have thus far 
written for us either textbooks or discussions on the 
teaching of the subject have been too eager to give their 
views as to the incomparable importance of their pet 
fields of knowledge to present us with a sane and 
judicial treatment. 
It is necessary to determine first the ability of chil- 
dren, at varying stages of growth, to learn geography in 
order to ascertain what and how much might be taught 
profitably, given unlimited time. It is necessary, in the 
second place, to take up the question of time and 
determine how much and what of this possible maximum 
may properly be attempted within the time limits of a 
school course of study. 
It is from this point of view almost of greater manifest 
importance to determine what should not be attempted 
than to tell what should be taught. The importance of 
the undertaking can hardly be overstated, because I am 
inclined to think that over geography and its allied sub- 
jects more time is wasted in school than over any other 
subject, not excepting arithmetic. 
I can merely speak as a layman, and I very modestly 
offer the following suggestions : 
Fundamental Defects. — The fundamental defects of 
most teaching of geography are first the attempt to give 
a knowledge of facts physically and psychologically re- 
mote from the children, before the necessary geographic 
concepts have been created, and, second, the continual
-P-A-G-E-179
      Geography 173 
presentation of verbal statements beyond the apper- 
ceptive range of the children learning them, which con- 
sequently are to them merely idle words. 
Geographic Concepts of a Child.—Let us consider the 
possible geographic concepts of a child of ten or eleven 
years, the age at which most children take a textbook 
in geography. If he has not been taught in school, he 
knows direction; something of distance; the location of 
the buildings and other notable objects of his neighbor- 
hood; such physical features as he has seen, probably 
hills and valleys, possibly lakes, rivers, brooks, and an 
ocean, — varying with the locality. He knows some- 
thing of the vegetation growing immediately about 
him, and will have a few surmises as to other kinds 
which he finds at the grocery. In like manner he 
knows a limited number of animals. He also knows 
weather. He is familiar ‘with industries in a general 
way, with one or two quite intimately. He knows a 
few types of people, generally so modified as to have 
more resemblances than differences. If he lives in 
one of the very large cities, his knowledge of types of 
people and of industries will be much greater, and of 
plants, animals, and physical phenomena correspondingly 
less. If he lives in the country, the reverse will be true. 
If he lives in a village or a small city, his apperceiving 
centers will vary toward one extreme or the other. But 
this knowledge is all purely local, and when extended by 
the imagination into remoter fields goes out unmodified. 
That is, the children imagine the farmers and the mer- 
chants and the manufacturers of foreign countries, of 
whom they learn in their geography books, as like the 
farmers and merchants and manufacturers that they see 
    
-P-A-G-E-180
  174 What Children Study and Why 
about them, and they cannot conceive them to be dif- 
ferent excepting as the result of new experiences or of 
good teaching. Such differences as they do imagine 
belong in the same class as fairy stories. The geography 
of Sindbad the Sailor’s voyages is much more real to 
many children than that of Europe, the difference be- 
ing solely in vividness of impression and not at all in 
accuracy. : 
Depends on Imagination. — This suggests the funda- 
mental difficulty in teaching geography. It depends 
so completely on the imagination. The children must 
project themselves into a purely imaginary world. In 
no other subject is this so completely true, not even in 
history. It is necessary to establish a point of contact 
between the real and the imaginary so that the former 
may be carried over into the latter, making the pictures 
of the unknown true. If the steps are too long, the 
children’s feet are lifted off the ground entirely. 
What is here described may be called the natural 
state of the avérage child as to geographical concepts. 
They are really all individual. He generalizes, of course, 
but his generalizations are merely the extensions of his 
limited experiences to unlimited and absurd lengths. 
The city child imagines all milk coming in bottles. A 
little boy said, “‘ Mamma, who puts the bottle of milk 
at our door every night while we are asleep?’ “ What 
a foolish question,” said the foolish mother; “ Why do 
you ask that?” ‘‘ Well,” answered the child, “ I s’pose 
God does, but I wanted to be sure.” A child in the 
mountains for the first time, where the milk came 
from the local dairy, said to her mother, “I don’t like 
cow’s milk; I like Borden’s better.” To one imagi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-181
  Geography 175 
native child Olympus is as remote as heaven and as 
unreal. To a second as described in “ Snowbound,” 
it is the local Huckleberry Hill magnified and peopled 
with strange beings. To a third, whose imagination 
has not been stirred, it is merely a word. Mani- 
festly, the second state is the only one that leads to 
geography. 
As to astronomical geography, the child’s concepts 
are even more vague. He has almost nothing to go on. 
He sees the heavenly bodies, it is true, but he cannot 
imagine the earth one of them. Such grotesque pic- 
tures as appear from time to time in the comic journals 
are more likely to convey to him some clear ideas of the 
earth as a heavenly body than do all the geography books. 
However, in childhood it is of little consequence whether 
the earth is a globe or a platter, so long as the sun and 
the moon and the stars rise in the east and set in the west, 
and season succeeds season, though of course it is well 
to tell children that the earth is round and let them grow 
into the knowledge. 
To recapitulate, the average child beginning to use 
a primary geography, if previously untaught, has a 
meager knowledge of the people he has seen, their char- 
acteristics and employments. He also knows the topog- 
raphy of his home town more or less completely and of 
such places as he may have visited. That is his equip- 
ment for the study of geography, except an unlimited 
imagination which tends to make a supernatural product 
of everything partially known, of everything described 
in words outside his experience. This statement covers 
fairly well the range of knowledge, hence of apperceiving 
centers, of the average child not specially taught.
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 What Children Study and Why 
Acquired Concepts. — But children in the average 
modern school when taking a textbook in geography 
are not in “ the natural state.” They have been given 
a great number of elementary geographic concepts in 
school, through oral instruction and through sup- 
plementary readers. It is important to consider this 
possible enlargement of the apperceiving possibilities. 
What does it commonly give? What should it give? 
How does it affect the first use of the textbook ? 
We must assume that instruction in any subject, at any 
time, is for the training of the minds and the enrichment 
of the lives of the children at the time, and not merely 
to prepare them for the use of a textbook later. 
The Imagination. — The first three years of school, 
before a textbook is used in geography, cover the period 
of the most vivid imagination of the whole school life. 
They are the days when fairy tales and nature myths ap- 
peal most strongly, when the mind can see in the unknown 
likeness to the known, but when differences readily run 
into grotesque images. Little boys and little girls and 
their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and 
pet animals are the same the world over, but unfamiliar 
creatures, unknown powers, readily become hideous 
monsters or kindly, absurd beasts. 
It is the childhood of the race over again. Gods and 
goddesses, fairies, nymphs, ogres, dragons, dwarfs, 
giants, valkyrs, angels, represent flights of the imagina- 
tion attempting to compass that which has no prototype 
or parallel in experience. 
So the early geographies made the giana parts of 
the world totally unlike the known parts. The imagi- 
nation, unchecked by knowledge, ran riot in two-headed
-P-A-G-E-183
  Geography 177 
giants, one-footed men, serpents coiled about the earth, 
turtles and fish as its supports, the heavens above, the 
earth beneath, and the waters under the earth. Scylla 
and Charybdis, Niflheim and Valhalla, Olympus and 
Hades, were mere attempts at geography, unguided by 
asane apperception. The voyages of Ulysses, the travels 
of Sir John Mandeville, the wanderings of Sindbad, all 
belong to the same class; and children, given geographic 
terms beyond their apperceptive powers, but appealing to 
their imaginations, are likely to make just such journey- 
ings. Truly, however, this is better than the deadly 
instruction whose words are drugs stupefying even the 
imagination. 
Important Concepts. — What concepts of the world 
should teachers seek to implant during the first three 
years of school? Naturally, such as grow out of the 
most vivid knowledge that the children have. That is, 
people, —the family, the playmates, the neighbors; 
the home environment, — food, bed, fireside, play, work ; 
animals and plants, — all the concerns of child life. 
Which of these can be extended most readily into the 
world beyond the immediate ken? That may vary with 
the circumstances. But I should say, first, child life 
in its most material aspects, — food, clothing, games, 
parental care, cold, heat, school, also the employments 
of others within the daily observation. How can this 
be done? I must repeat, all geographic knowledge 
except that obtained by direct observation comes through 
the imagination. Hence, facts taught to children, to 
be of value, must be extensive, that is, they must prepare 
the minds for the production of correct images of the 
remote and unseen when described in words. It is the
-P-A-G-E-184
  178 What Children Study and Why 
failure to consider this that has often reduced to ab- 
surdity so-called “ home geography,” making it merely 
a statement of the obvious. The bare fact, like a 
smooth round pebble, has little educational worth. 
A fact must be covered with hooks to give it value. 
Hence, the geographic ideas to be given during these 
primary school years are to be estimated by their pos- 
sible relations, the strength and tenacity of their tentacles, 
rather than by their manifest substance. They must 
produce the sort of intelligence that prepares the way 
for further intelligence. This is rather vague, I admit. 
It does not tell what to teach. And, indeed, it is im- 
possible to dogmatize about that. 
Influence of Environment.— So much depends upon 
what the children of any school are likely to have seen 
and heard before coming to school. The first lessons 
for a class in Louisiana should be different in many 
respects from those for a class in Maine, because the 
“known ”’ differs. To a child in southern California 
grass is an exotic raised on lawns with great difficulty. 
To a child in Minnesota bananas and oranges occur only 
on fruit stands and at the grocer’s. 
The first steps from the known cannot be very long, 
especially because of the psychological fact above noted, 
that children readily see likenesses but can make little edu- 
cational use of differences. Almost the only differences to 
be noted with profit at first are those of degree, the adding 
to the known, or substracting from it some other known. 
A child never having seen a cow cannot imagine one 
except as like a dog, or a mouse, or some other known 
animal. (See “ Contents of a Child’s Mind,” Stanley 
Hall.) But the same child has no difficulty whatever 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
Geography 179 
with a two-headed giant or an animal with the power of 
speech, or a bodiless head. Children in a temperate 
zone can understand Agoonack, because they can imagine 
a very long winter; but to children in southern Florida, 
or in Cuba, Agoonack’s home belongs with the land at 
the top of Jack’s beanstalk. To Anna Josefsky, of 
Baxter Street, New York, a rolling prairie is a wheel on 
a cart or perhaps a barrel rolling along the sidewalk, or 
possibly a roller skate. And there is no way of correct- 
ing these images at the time. All attempts to give 
knowledge of conditions widely different from those 
familiar should be abandoned with young children. 
Contrasts may be used, but only contrasts both of whose 
elements are known. Differences in climate as to heat 
and cold may be explained because children know both. 
Contrasts used must be of degree or quality of known 
elements. 
The first steps should be to likenesses with slightly 
differing aspects, and these should be made easy by 
graphic and constructive illustrations. For instance, 
the dress and food of children in other lands can easily 
be made clear by illustration. Games, if known, are 
good beginnings. Homes and the modes of sleeping and 
eating are not difficult to teach and are very suggestive. 
When the children can read quite readily, such books as 
“ Seven Little Sisters ” are very helpful. As Dr. Taylor 
clearly shows in his valuable articles in “‘ Educational 
Foundations,” stories with geographic settings are among 
the best means of imparting concepts. 
The Study of Physical Features. — The question of 
studying physical features is sure to arise. The answer 
must depend very largely upon the locality. Little can
-P-A-G-E-186
  180 What Children Study and Why 
be done profitably in very large cities during these first 
years, but in smaller places, and especially in rural dis- 
tricts, a beginning may be made. This, of course, must 
be a mere extension of “ nature study,” just a touch of 
“cause and effect ” applied to observations. “ Brooks 
and Brook-basins”’ is suggestive of a good model. If 
children are familiar with hills but not with mountains, 
they can be told that a mountain is a big hill with no 
harm — and little good effect. 
I was born among hills with no mountains near. Dur- 
ing all my childhood a mountain was a mysterious object, 
conical and with a sharp-pointed peak, like the pictures 
in the book. I had an idea that it was big, but that 
meant little. This is to be said, however. My curiosity 
to see a mountain was in inverse ratio to my conception 
of one, and that was doubtless valuable. But it does not 
take much formal teaching to rouse in children curiosity 
about mountains or oceans or foreign lands that can be 
satisfied only in later years and by travel. 
Make it Picturesque. — As to method, I suggest only 
that all possible means be used to make the instruction 
picturesque and vivid. Sand table construction, stories, 
and pictures are the chief reliance in the primary grades. 
Construction is the most effective means of straightening 
out twisted imaginations. Word pictures developed into 
sand pictures or construction pictures are excellent. 
Children at this age especially need the reaction of ex- 
pressive activities. 
Use of Pictures. — A caution is perhaps needed as to 
the use of pictures. It is by no means certain that 
looking at a picture will produce an accurate impression 
of the object portrayed. I have seen in geography books
-P-A-G-E-187
  
Geography 181 
and in other books, too, on the same page, pictures of 
unfamiliar objects of varying sizes, in different scales, 
so that a bird was as large as an elephant and a zebra 
as large as a Hindoo temple. The effect is inevitable. 
Children, ignorant of them all, will conceive them like 
the pictures. The bird, in their minds, is as large as the 
elephant, and the zebra as the temple. Pictures of 
whole scenes with several objects in proper relations are 
better for children than pictures of single objects, because 
relative values are then given. I am aware that some 
art teachers may differ with me, but I am not talking art. 
I am talking psychology and geography. 
A picture of Agoonack suitably dressed is satisfactory, 
because the children, knowing her to be a child, fix the 
environment and the size accordingly. But a picture 
of a strange animal appeals to no such apperceiving mass. 
So, generally, large pictures, sufficiently composite to give 
relative values, are the best for teaching geography to 
young children. The tiny pictures tucked in the corners 
of pages or grouped artistically in geographies or sup- 
plementary readers are frequently worse than useless. 
They lie to the children. 
Another chapter of knowledge that may be opened to 
the children is the industrial, — what people about them 
do to provide food and clothing and homes for their 
families. This is valuable in itself and furnishes very 
excellent hooks to hang other things on. As is evident 
from Miss Young’s studies, quoted by Dr. Taylor, in the 
articles above named, interest in industries is an ac- 
quired taste, but it is none the less desirable. Indeed, 
one of the aims of early oral instruction is to develop 
geographic concepts that would otherwise not be de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  
182 What Children Study and Why 
veloped at all. Soap is an acquired taste, as is civili- 
zation itself. 
Caution. — But here, too, caution is necessary. Avoid 
giving instruction in the obvious. Ina rural community, 
where nearly every one makes a living by farming, little 
attention should be paid to that industry at this stage, 
except to lead to others. If dairy farming is the chief 
industry, follow the milk until it goes beyond the knowl- 
edge of the children, adding a step, to the condensing 
factory, the sterilizing plant, the cheese or butter factory, 
or to the city in bottles, — some point of new knowledge. 
But especially study the industries of the few, those which 
most children will not know without instruction, but 
which may, however, be studied by observation; as 
the blacksmith, the merchant. If a cow has been sold 
to the butcher, what must happen before the skin is 
brought back as shoes? 
In the city, more industries may be observed and some 
objects in common use may be traced to sources. But it 
must all be very simple and very clear. The knowledge 
must be fresh and of immediate interest. Moreover, 
these very characteristics make it better as an apper- 
ceiving center. 
The work of the first three years in geography should 
be largely incidental, should seek to enlarge the apper- 
ceiving powers, and should give a few clear concepts 
that will enable the imaginations of children to grasp 
the new and larger facts concerning the world, which may 
properly be presented in the higher grades. 
All this knowledge should be vital and of interest and 
worth at the time, for only such vital knowledge can be 
the basis of apperception. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
CHAPTER XVI 
GEOGRAPHY FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
AssuMinc that the children have received the training 
outlined in the preceding chapter, that they possess a few 
elementary general geographic concepts, that they have 
acquired the ability to extend through the imagination 
their acquaintance of their immediate environment _ 
enough to comprehend like conditions at a distance, what 
should the primary geography do for them, and how? 
The World not the Earth. — Primary geography, to 
meet the apperceptive possibilities of even the brightest 
children, should deal with the world more than with 
the earth. The earth is a “ heavenly body,” a member 
of the solar system. The world is this globe we live on, 
with all its oceans, mountains, and plains, all its plants, 
all its creatures, all its people with their races, relations, 
commerce, likenesses, and differences, and their govern- 
ments and political divisions. 
Should give Few Facts. — It should not seek to teach 
a large number of facts, especially the facts of political 
geography, such as names of cities, boundaries, items of 
production and commerce in lists, such as “ Indiana 
produces corn, wheat, and hogs.” 
It should have no one or two or three-line sentences 
giving isolated facts, as: “ Lynn has many shoe facto- 
ries,” “ Birmingham has extensive iron foundries.” 
The great defect of most elementary geographies is 
183
-P-A-G-E-190
    184 What Children Study and Why 
excess of zeal in giving all the facts the author knows. 
These facts, not apperceived, not related to any interest 
in the child’s mind, merely clog his memory, or pass swiftly 
into the useful waste basket of forgetfulness. There are 
very few primary geography books that do not err in 
this regard, though some are greater sinners than others, 
of course. 
Should extend Knowledge. — The primary geography 
should extend the childish knowledge, acquired before 
taking the book, through the imagination. It should 
give more and more definite geographic concepts. It 
should make the remote parts of the world seem real and 
should explain to the children a limited number of phe- 
nomena and conditions as rapidly as they can grasp them. 
Detailed Study of Types. — This should be accom- 
plished mainly through the somewhat detailed study of 
a few typical instances, which may lead to a compre- 
hension of a few general truths of wide application. 
What children need is possession, not of many facts, but 
of pregnant facts. All school instruction should aim 
first to develop, and then to fix, general truths applicable 
to many instances. Against this fundamental law of 
education, no subject is a greater transgressor than 
geography. The subject is so comprehensive, there are 
so many facts of so many kinds in its field, that writers 
of textbooks on the subject have, with few exceptions, 
abandoned the effort and fallen back weakly upon the 
old plan of crowding all the facts possible within the 
pages of the books, trusting to Providence to save the 
children. 
Develop Generalizations from Instances. — Not only 
should a primary geography give a few broad but defi-
-P-A-G-E-191
  Geography for Primary Grades 185 
nite generalizations of wide application, but it should 
develop these from instances, not merely state them. 
The larger the truth, the more important does it become 
to arrive at it in the right way, the way of real as distin- 
guished from “ verbal”? knowledge. The truth stated 
may mean something or it may mean nothing to the 
hearer. The truth that grows upon the vision, slowly, 
from cause to effect, from what is already known to 
a new truth, becomes a part of the mind itself. This is 
real knowledge. 
It is worth more to a primary class to know that there 
are many waterfalls along the Genesee River, that water- 
falls may be used to drive machinery, and that hence one 
might expect to find manufactories in the Genesee Valley, 
and then to know that Rochester and other manufactur- 
ing places are found here, than to have a list of all the 
cities of central New York with a statement that each 
produces this or that article. 
Elimination and Selection. — Evidently, then, before 
the teaching of geography becomes even reasonably 
satisfactory, two things are necessary, elimination and 
selection of material and the introduction of the labora- 
tory method. 
For the former courage is needed. Elementary 
geography must cease to attempt to give universal 
knowledge, and must confine itself to a few types, em- 
bodying generalizations. The greater part of the small 
items relating to political geography, which fill most of 
our primary textbooks, must be cut out entirely. Those 
that are to remain must be carefully selected as typical, 
so that children may have the wherewithal to assimilate 
new facts as they present themselves.  
-P-A-G-E-192
  186. What Children Study and Why 
The full, detailed study of a single city or mountain 
range or river valley is worth more to a primary school 
child than the naming of all with an item or two about 
each. 
By detailed study, I mean study as nearly at first 
hand as possible; at any rate, the study of essential 
characteristics, one by one, in such a way that they are 
comprehended. This means the use of the laboratory 
method in so far as it can be used. 
The Laboratory Method. — By the laboratory method 
I mean the use of direct observation of typical forms and 
drawing conclusions from these observations. 
If in the neighborhood of a river or a mountain, or in 
a large city, the immediate environment should be studied 
to master the type. The book is merely incidental. 
When studying forms not to be found in the immediate 
environment, some typical instance easily comprehended 
through description and story should be selected and 
studied in much picturesque detail until a clear, pregnant 
image is secured. Suppose the subject is a river, and 
there is none near. Select the river in which the children 
are most likely to be interested, for instance, if in the 
Middle West, the Mississippi or the Ohio, if in New 
England,- the Connecticut, or if on the western coast, 
the Columbia. 
Spend time enough upon it to make it loom large in the 
imaginations of children. See that a vivid picture of 
the river, from source to mouth, is in the mind of every 
child, — its banks, thecountry it flows through, the towns 
along it, its traffic, if any, its influence upon the life in 
its vicinity — all the facts that an investigating traveler 
of the age of the children would acquire. A single such 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  Geography for Primary Grades 187 
study is worth more than the naming all the rivers on 
the continent. 
Follow Natural Interests. — One more thing should be 
said. A primary geography should follow the natural 
interest of children, which proceeds from themselves 
outward. ‘This is chiefly in marked resemblances and in 
marked contrasts, that they can understand. It is in 
people more than in things. It passes from people to the 
things that affect them. It weighs all values by effects 
upon people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  CHAPTER XVII 
GEOGRAPHY FOR GRAMMAR GRADES 
Establish Apperceiving Centers. — The principal aim 
of the teaching of geography in the grammar school is 
the same as in the primary school, namely, the establish- 
ment of apperceiving centers. In both, geography is 
mainly an informational subject of the most general 
character. The amount of actual knowledge that can 
be acquired by a child in school at the most is, however, 
so pitifully small that it is of the slightest value, unless 
it is strongly cohesive and carefully organized. It must 
be of such a sort that new knowledge resulting from read- 
ing and travel will readily find its place around the ap- 
perceiving centers established by the study of geography 
in school and will get its explanation from them. I have 
asked children in school, who were living near the foot- 
hills of the Appalachian range, while studying geogra- 
phy, if they had ever seen a mountain, and have 
received the answer, ‘“ No.” 
No one will question that the older geographies gave 
little heed to this need. They supplied for the most 
part condensed and desiccated statements of fact, both 
uninteresting to children and conveying little, if any, 
meaning to them. Of what use, for example, to a gram- 
mar school child is the statement, quoted from a ge- 
ography, quite modern too, that ‘“ On the slopes of the 
Himalayas are the independent states Nepal and Bhutan 
188
-P-A-G-E-195
  
Geography for Grammar Grades 189 
and the native principality of Kashmir.” This is unex- 
plained and unamplified except by a single sentence about 
Kashmir. It is taken from a page filled with just such 
isolated statements. If memorized is not such informa- 
tion given in such a way worse than useless? Is it not 
sure to result in merely verbal knowledge, attic refuse, 
which is not knowledge at all? Is it not likely to in- 
terrupt the natural process of learning, to impair the 
assimilative power of the child, and to make the subject 
itself disasteful? The example quoted is by no means an 
isolated or an extreme instance. It is a type of the state- 
ments that pervade all the older geographies and several 
of the newer ones. 
Wherein are its defects? It ignores apperception. 
It takes for granted that comprehensive general knowl- 
edge of the world which it should be the function of a 
geography to give. Geographies like the one quoted 
lack detail and yet have too much detail. That which 
they have is of the wrong sort and in the wrong places. 
It consists in a vast number of isolated and, to a child, 
meaningless facts. The detail needed, as in the pri- 
mary grades, is the amplification of single typical subjects, 
with abundant illustration and many associated and in- 
teresting facts, which may serve as a basis for inducing 
principles. Better ten pages devoted to the complete 
exposition of a single river valley than the same space 
filled with a hundred isolated statements about as many 
river valleys. 
The former may serve to establish certain general 
truths regarding valleys and their relations to the in- 
dustrial and social life in them, which will create justi- 
fiable expectations as to other valleys that may be studied,
-P-A-G-E-196
  190 What Children Study and Why 
that is, it will establish principles which may be applied 
in all future study of similar conditions. The latter 
produces nothing but verbal congestion. The trouble is 
that in our zeal to teach everything we teach nothing 
well. 
For a child in New York studying the geography of 
Minnesota it is important to know of St. Paul and 
Minneapolis at the head of navigation of the Mississippi 
River, and to know enough about them to estab- 
lish interest and some appreciation of their relations to 
his breakfast. The fact that ‘“‘ Mankato has flour mills, 
stone and cement industries, and iron foundries” (quoted 
from a recently published geography), had better be 
omitted. It obscures the main proposition and will 
speedily be forgotten, as it ought to be. For a child in 
Minnesota this should be given and amplified. The 
book above quoted gives seven lines to North Dakota, 
as a whole, and fifteen to six of its tiny cities. The whole 
twenty-two lines are worthless to a New England child. 
Two or three paragraphs giving the place of North 
_ Dakota in the industrial world, or describing its prairies, 
might be of value. 
Principles must grow from Instances.— Here, again, 
as in the elementary grades, we come upon an error 
which may be said to dominate some of the newer text- 
books. They give much space to the comprehensive 
statement of principles, for example, those of. physi- 
ography, in general terms, instead of developing them out 
of observed or localized conditions. And, to make the 
matter worse, these unsupported generalizations are 
usually given in the earlier parts of the book, to be con- 
sumed by children just out of the primary school.
-P-A-G-E-197
Geography for Grammar Grades 191 
It is impossible to say which violates the more fla- 
grantly universally accepted principles of education, the 
generalization stated, not induced from abundant con- 
crete detail, or the mass of unorganized facts presented 
to be “ learned by heart,”’ when no principles have been 
established to explain and clarify them. 
Grammar School Children still Children. — They both 
ignore the truths that grammar school children are still 
children, with children’s limitations, and that knowl- 
edge is the result of growth. The normal child begin- 
ning to use the “big” geography is twelve years old. 
He has a twelve-year-old child’s limited vocabulary 
and very limited knowledge of the world. Yet he has 
thrust into his childish hands a textbook stating in 
broad general terms the great truths or supposed truths 
of the earth’s formation and present conditions as to 
climate, surface, and relations to the solar system, not 
developed from observation or present knowledge, but 
generalized and stated in words that require a dictionary 
with each sentence, and this information his childish 
mind is supposed to take, assimilate, and use in future 
study. Truly the cry of the children against the igno- 
rant, well-meant assaults of their older well-wishers never 
ceases. 
The advanced geography, like its primary predecessor, 
should appeal to the interests of children as children, 
should present to them a great number of interesting 
and illuminating detail about a comparatively few topics, 
and should develop from these a few important funda- 
mental principles which will serve as an apperceiving 
basis for all future geographic knowledge. It should be 
first extensive, very, and should gradually become in-
-P-A-G-E-198
    192 What Children Study and Why 
tensive as the children gain power to see and apply 
principles. : 
The first duty, then, of the writer of a geography for 
grammar schools, as for primary schools, is selection 
and elimination. The second is the presentation of 
the selected matter in simple language and with 
abundant interesting detail, so as to arouse and hold 
interest and, by degrees, in the natural way of growth, 
to establish the few fundamental principles. 
What interests Children. — What geographic matters 
interest children in the grammar schools? The same as 
in the primary, first, people, always people, how they 
look, how they dress, how they act, how they work, and 
how they play, — how they live. Second, nature, that 
which is all about them, rocks, trees, flowers, animals, 
rivers, oceans, hills, mountains, weather, and the relations 
of all this to themselves and to other people. Third, how 
man has modified and utilized nature, as shown in cities, 
industries, and institutions. This is geography, of course. 
The important thing is to begin right and to proceed 
from existing interest to ever new and widening interest. 
City and Country. — Children, like ourselves, divide 
the world into cities and “the country.” This is a 
fundamental division, — places where men live close 
together with comparatively little of nature as an element 
in their lives, and places where they live apart, with 
nature as the principal environment. Some features, 
such as the weather and the sun, moon, and stars, day 
and night, and the seasons, and perhaps hills, a river 
and an ocean, also government and other social institu- 
tions, are common to both. But the differences are 
greater than the likenesses.
-P-A-G-E-199
  Geography for Grammar Grades 193 
For the city child it is easier to develop from his 
environment a knowledge of human institutions, such 
as government and commerce, than for the country child. 
But for the country child natural phenomena and earth 
forms — the facts of physiography — are more easily 
developed. But both may be utilized for all children 
as the starting points for the establishment of the funda- 
mental facts of the two great interlocking divisions of 
geography, natural conditions and human institutions. 
The study of the relations of these two follows naturally. 
What can the Teacher Do?—The teacher may 
naturally say here: “That is all very true, but what 
are we to do about it? We have to use the textbooks 
supplied.” 
That is true, of course. Hence it is all the more im- 
portant for the teacher to have a very clear conception 
of the aim of teaching geography in order that, even if 
compelled to use poor books, he may make the best use 
of the material furnished by the books, may organize it 
properly, and may supplement it by all the means in his 
power. 
Duty of the Superintendent. — The first duty rests 
upon the superintendent who makes the local course of 
study. He should lay out the work in proper groupings, 
selecting the significant central features, and should 
show how to use the material furnished by the textbook 
and how to supplement it from other sources, by means 
of pictures, lantern slides, and concurrent reading. He 
should supply carefully prepared lists of available 
material, which teachers may secure. 
If possible, every school should have a good lantern, 
with an abundance of well-chosen slides suited to the
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 What Children Study and Why 
work of different grades. Some one room can easily 
be supplied with dark curtains to be used on occasion by 
different classes. 
Besides this, each school should have a collection of 
photographs illustrating various phases of geography. 
These can be used by the different classes. And, of 
course, each school should have sets of the best geographi- 
cal readers for the work of each grade. This supple- 
mentary reading matter should be carefully classified to 
fit the course of study, so as to make the study of geog- 
raphy vital, and to keep the teachers from the deadly 
routine of the textbook. 
In small towns a single lantern and set of slides, a single 
collection of photographs, and a central library of sup- 
plementary reading may be made to serve all the 
schools by a little care in arranging the time schedules. 
What one Teacher Did.— If the authorities do-not 
organize the work in this way, then it is for each 
teacher to do the best possible in this direction. I 
have known an individual teacher to carry out a 
scheme of geography teaching so successfully as to 
furnish a model to an entire school system. Among the 
devices that she employed was one of having geography 
days set apart devoted to some particular geographic 
feature, usually a race or people, for example, a Japan 
day, when everything characteristic of the Japanese that 
the children could obtain appeared in the room. Japanese 
pictures and draperies and costumes and products were 
all represented. Children appeared in Japanese tableaux, 
showing some striking characteristic of the national life. 
Japanese stories were told. Naturally all available 
sources of knowledge and of material for representation
-P-A-G-E-201
  Geography for Grammar Grades 195 
were drawn upon. Great enthusiasm prevailed; the 
facts found out and told or written by the children, you 
may be sure, were the facts that interest children. It 
was a good study of what to teach in geography. . 
On other days, as called for by the course of study, 
other themes were treated with a like appropriateness. 
But, whatever the topic, whether Japan or South Africa, 
or Germany or England, or coal mining, or dairying, or 
making cotton cloth, a very real and very vivid impres- 
sion was left with the children. They really knew what 
they had studied. They could never again be wholly 
indifferent to, any one of these subjects. Moreover, the 
knowledge was organized. It was all properly grouped 
about a suitable nucleus. Through it the children were 
supplied with apperceptive centers for the placing of new 
facts and with geographic principles to explain new 
phenomena. 
This was accomplished by a single teacher with many 
successive classes, without much help from her superior 
officers. It should be encouraging to teachers who know 
how geography should be taught but are compelled still 
to use inferior textbooks or to follow antiquated or 
insufficient courses of study. Unless teachers grasp 
these principles, not even ideal books and courses of study 
will secure the best results.
-P-A-G-E-202
  CHAPTER XVIII 
NAtuRE STUDY 
“ Nature Stupy ” has meanings almost as numerous 
as the schools pursuing it. It came in late as one of the 
forms of protest against the game of logomachy into 
which school studies had degenerated in the third quarter 
of the nineteenth century. From its name it is evident 
that it was intended to indicate a “return to nature,” 
a reéstablishment of the connection between the educa- 
tion of children and the physical environment in which 
their lives must be spent. 
Aim of Nature Study. — At its best it is the study of 
the phenomena of the physical world with the more 
or less definite aim of discovering some of the laws 
that cause them, and their significance to human 
beings. It differs from the study of natural science 
much as the “ language lessons” of the elementary 
school differ from grammar. Its chief purposes are 
to open the eyes to the wonders and beauties of 
the environing world, to create sympathetic interest 
in all animate creatures, and to restore the sense of 
reality in a system of education quite given over to 
verbal statements about things. It was a product or 
corollary of the interest in scientific study which fol- 
lowed the promulgation of Darwin’s theories. The aim 
is most worthy, and there was, and still is, abundant 
need for such an equilibrant. 
196
-P-A-G-E-203
  Nature Study 197 
Still Chaotic. — However, nature study in elementary 
schools still is in a chaotic, unorganized, possibly a forma- 
tive, state. It began with the “ object lessons ” which 
some of us remember, a loose, unsystematic exercise con- 
sisting mainly of reciting stated facts about the common 
phenomena of physics, accompanied by a little individual 
observation. This gave way to a more orderly study of 
elementary science. In some schools, quite elaborate 
systems were developed, with full courses in the elements 
of botany and zodlogy, and even with special super- 
visors to direct the instruction. These attempts rather 
overshot the mark and contributed much to the over- 
crowding of the curriculum. At present the study seems 
to be settling into the place of adjutant, supplying 
topics and material for correlation with language and 
with geography, varying with the interest and knowl- 
edge of the teacher. Its best present-day manifesta- 
tions are school gardens, terraria and aquaria in the 
schoolroom, and “ field lessons.” Manifestly nature 
study must vary, more widely than any other study, with 
the environment. 
Early Blunders. — The greatest mistake of the earlier 
teaching of this subject in schools was the attempt to 
observe natural objects out of their natural relations. A 
bug, a frog, a crayfish, were brought in to the school, dis- 
sected, discussed, and scientifically classified. This had 
little value, very little, in cultivating closeobservation. It 
did nothing to acquaint children with environing nature, 
to open their eyes to the beauties of sky and meadow, 
brook and plowed field, to make them love the voice of 
the bird, wonder at the marvelous adaptations of plant 
and animal life. The objects chosen were difficult to 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  198 What Children Study and Why 
obtain and, when observed away from their habitats, 
not very interesting to the children. The anatomy of 
the animal or the plant was treated as of more conse- 
quence than its life. 
The Near rather than the Remote.— Nature study 
for children should be the study of the near rather 
than of the remote. The geological history of a grain 
of sand from the road is vastly more worth while 
than that of a fragment of gneiss from the museum. 
Nature study should be out of doors as far as possible, 
the study of what is immediate and common. 
Professor L. H. Bailey says in “ The Outlook to 
Nature”: “The first consideration of special study 
should be the inhabitants of your yard and garden; they 
are yours, or if they are not, you are not living a right 
life.” 
Even in the most crowded parts of a big city, the paving 
stones and the gutters and the ever present sparrows 
present interesting problems for nature study. Besides, 
there are the parks, with their birds and trees and flowers. 
In the small town and especially in the country, nature 
is everywhere asking to be understood. If children could 
only be put into sympathetic touch with her “in her 
various moods,” it would go far toward restoring a more 
béautiful and a saner life. 
In the language of Walt Whitman (quoted by Profes- 
sor Bailey), 
“There was a child went forth every day, 
And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became, 
And that object became part of him for the day or a certain 
part of the day, 
Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.
-P-A-G-E-205
  
Nature Study 199 
“The early lilacs became part of this child, 
And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red 
clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird, 
And the third-month lambs and the sow’s pink-faint litter, and 
the mare’s foal and the cow’s calf, 
And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the 
pond-side, 
And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below here, and 
the beautiful curious liquid, 
And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became 
part of him.” 
Lord Avebury, in a fine passage on the same subject, 
remarks: “ If Spring came but once in a lifetime; if the 
sun rose and set once in a year instead of once in a day; 
if a rainbow appeared once in a century; if flowers were 
as rare as rubies and dewdrops as diamonds, how wonder- 
ful would they seem, how they would astonish and 
delight us. We undervalue them because they are 
lavished on us. The very word ‘common’ most im- 
properly implies some disparagement. If we trained 
our minds properly in the appreciation of beauty, we 
should, on the contrary, wonder at and admire them all 
the more.” 
In a still finer passage, Emerson says: “If the stars 
should appear one night in a thousand years, how would 
men believe and adore, and preserve for many genera- 
tions the remembrance of the city of God which had been 
shown! But every night come out these envoys of 
beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing 
smile.”” 
But the sort of harmony with nature suggested by 
Whitman and of appreciation indicated by Avebury and 
Emerson are not to be brought about by observing and 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  200 What Children Study and Why 
drawing a dead bug, even though observed “ right end 
first.” 
Beauty of Life. — There is one aim of nature study in 
particular that should be emphasized, the beauty and 
worth of the living thing, and its right to live unless it 
works harm to man or its body is needed for his 
legitimate use. 
That relic of the barbaric days of the race, the silly 
desire to kill by trap or gun harmless animals for “ sport,” 
should disappear before interest in the lives of animals. 
The glory of the hunter who bravely hides in ambush 
and shoots a harmless unsuspecting bird or deer for mere 
pleasure should be turned to shame. If the children 
desire to hunt, the camera is a much better implement 
than the shotgun and secures vastly more interesting 
results. | 
This change is bound to come as we become more en- 
lightened. Since the introduction of nature study into 
schools, within my recollection, cruelty to animals by 
both children and adults has been greatly lessened. 
Our entire nation has become more humane. The next 
step is the elimination of the “ sportsman ” who sneaks 
behind a tree to shoot an inoffensive beast or bird, giving 
him no chance even for a fair fight for his life. 
Nature study should leave the children richer in ap- 
preciation of the wonders and beauties of the world about 
them, with eyes keener, spirits fresher, sympathies 
broader for all creatures, and themselves in the way of 
becoming larger and simpler men and women.
-P-A-G-E-207
CHAPTER XIX 
Nature Stupy 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION 
Tue method of nature study in the elementary school 
has been too often a feeble copying of the method of the 
scientific laboratory of the university or of the investigat- 
ing specialist, whereas it should be almost its antipode. 
Natural Setting. — Wherever possible, as was clearly 
indicated in the preceding chapter, it should consist 
mainly of the study of objects in their natural setting 
and of phenomena as and where they occur, the tcacher 
always having in mind that the aim is chiefly, not to 
give scientific knowledge, but rather to arouse interest, 
even enthusiasm, regarding that which is all about us. 
Study out of Doors. — Whenever possible also, and it 
is always possible in the country and in small towns, it 
should be at first out-of-door study and of common 
everyday objects and phenomena. A garden cultivated 
on the school grounds is the best laboratory for the 
study of plants and of some animals. The growth of 
flowers or common herbs from bud or bulb to maturity 
is a never-failing source of pleasure and interest, and 
makes possible the consideration of soils and of the 
various friends and enemies of the plants. It is not 
necessary to elaborate upon school gardens. There are 
several books that treat this subject fully and satis- 
factorily. 
205 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  202 What Children Study and Why 
Field Excursions.— The field excursion is another 
excellent means for developing interest and acuteness 
of observation, and provides opportunity to gather 
material for indoor study. 
The groups going on such an excursion should be small 
for each teacher. While the children should be en- 
couraged to observe all the phenomena, excursions should 
have some definite aim, as the action of a brook, the 
growth of some particular crop, the study of certain nest- 
ing birds, the observation of the habits of some animal 
in its native habitat. If possible a good field glass and 
a camera should be taken, the former to enable the ob- 
server to watch the actions of animals without disturb- 
ing them, and the latter to obtain accurate and per- 
manent reports of especially interesting and illuminating 
appearances. 
It is well for the children to take notes of what they 
observe, to be discussed later in the schoolroom,.and 
possibly written about for language exercises. 
Out of doors the large and plainly visible aspects of 
nature should be studied, such as cannot be observed 
in the schoolroom: in the physical realm, such things as 
the effects of winds and of rain, of clouds, and of running 
water ; in the realm of living things, the grouping of trees 
and plants in pastures and in woods, the habits of 
birds in pairs and in flocks, and of groups of animals at 
pasture. 
Nature Study in Cities.— The city presents its own 
problems. But in most of even the larger cities 
occasional excursions to the fields or to the parks are 
possible, and in some cases room for gardens is 
obtainable in the school yard or upon the roof,
-P-A-G-E-209
  Nature Study 203 
Window boxes, also, in which carefully chosen seeds ger- 
minate and grow to maturity, are always possible and 
offer opportunity for much interesting observation and 
discussion. 
In the Schoolroom. — Nature study in the school- 
room naturally requires a method quite different from 
that out of doors. Here, in the main, individual objects 
must be studied, removed from their natural setting. 
These objects should be such as naturally interest chil- 
dren, and are readily obtained. The domestic cat, dogs, 
rabbits, chickens, are better than the amoeba or even 
the crayfish. 
Study Function. — The study of these objects should 
be the study of function or of anatomy as related to 
function and never of mere anatomy. Dissection 
should be always taboo. An excellent study is that 
of the comparison of the different functions of similar 
organs of different animals, as the fore limbs of 
fishes, birds, quadrupeds, and man. The questions 
that always call for an answer are: What is this 
organ for? What does the animal do with it? How 
does it contribute to his needs as a living being? 
Suppose noses are the subject. What kind of nose has 
the rabbit, the cat, the dog, the pig, the child? For what 
does each one use his nose? How does its particular 
form administer to its usefulness? 
The degree of intelligence displayed by different ani- 
mals is an interesting topic. What does each one do 
through sheer instinct? What actions are dictated by 
intelligence and some degree of reason? 
Relation of Man to Nature.— Then always the 
relations to man of the objects or animals observed 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  204.- What Children Study and Why 
should receive careful consideration. What does each 
contribute to our well-being, and how? 
This study should lead to a consideration of the treat- 
ment of living nature, both plants and, especially, animals. 
What is due each one, from us? How far are the lives of 
lower creatures sacred? Under what circumstances 
may they rightly be taken? When and to what degree 
should they be unmolested? To what degree of freedom 
are these creatures entitled? What right have we to 
deprive them of freedom, to cage them, to utilize them? 
With older children, even the use and abuse of “ vivi- 
section ” may be discussed with profit. 
Correlation. — As has been intimated, nature study 
is readily correlated with other subjects, notably with 
language study. But, for this purpose, the study 
should be of nature as it is, the sky, the weather, the 
brooks, the hills, the birds and beasts, all in natural 
setting. Nature studied in this way is the best intro- 
duction to geography. Nature study should also be 
closely allied with physiology, as indicated in chapter 
XXI. Of all the possible correlations, that of the great- 
est importance is with literature. Mere informational 
books about nature are dangerous in the school. They 
are apt to be substituted for first-hand observation. At 
the most they should be used only to supplement and 
explain what has been observed. But the study of the 
poets of nature and of such prose writers as Thoreau 
and Burroughs is most useful in connection with direct 
observation. These are they who see the hidden spir- 
itual significance of the phenomena of nature. They 
point out the rich analogies between the wonders and 
beauties of the physical world and the spirit of man,
-P-A-G-E-211

It is well to observe the weather, the marvelous changes 
of cloud and sky wrought by wind and rain and sunshine, 
and while doing this to read and memorize Shelley’s 
“ Cloud,” or Moore’s lines beginning : 
“O God, thou art the life and light 
Of all this wondrous world we see.” 
or Shakespeare’s sonnet 
“Full many a glorious morning have I seen 
Flatter the mountain tops with sovran eye, 
Kissing with golden face the meadows green, 
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.” 
The highest function of literature is to illumine the 
common things of life and to point out the ever present 
analogy between the things we see with our eyes and our 
own spiritual aspirations and experiences, and this can 
be made plain to children in correlation with nature study 
more readily perhaps than in any other way. 
Résumé. — The aims of all method in nature study 
should be: (1) to acquaint the children with nature as it 
is, as God made it; (2) to show them its relations to men, 
how they have modified it, for what purpose and with 
what rights, to the end that children may become lovers 
of nature and wise in its use; and (3) to show the spirit- 
ual significance of the natural world, its laws, its phe- 
nomena, its modes of life. 
“To him who in the love of Nature holds 
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks 
A various language ; for his gayer hours 
She has a voice of gladness and a smile | 
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides 
Into his darker musings, with a mild 
And healing sympathy, that steals away 
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.” -~ BRYANT.

  CHAPTER XX 
PuysIoLocy 
Tue subject of physiology in a course of study for 
public schools should properly be considered among the 
natural sciences. But its position in our schools is so 
peculiar, because.of an anomalous and to a degree arti- 
ficial correlation with ethics and politics, that it seems 
necessary to treat it as constituting a class by itself. 
Analysis of the Subject. — Human physiology is the 
science of the human body considered as a living organism. 
It deals with the functions of the various organs and rests 
upon anatomy, which treats of the structure of the body 
as a whole and of its different parts. Anatomy may be 
learned directly and completely from the study of dead 
bodies. As physiology deals with life, it can be studied 
properly only in living organisms. 
Hygiene is a corollary of physiology. Its function is 
to show how the various organs of the body may be made 
to perform: their functions in a normal manner. Its 
province is the laws of health. The order of importance 
of these subjects, to children especially, is (rt) Hygiene, 
(2) Physiology, (3) Anatomy. The educational order 
is the same. 
Even quite young children can be taught profitably 
such simple laws of health as the importance of cleanli- 
ness and the danger of eating certain things, such as un- 
ripe fruit. Later, with the growth of curiosity, not only 
206
-P-A-G-E-213
  Physiology 207 
may the list of laws be extended, but reasons for some 
of them may be given, thus leading naturally to some of 
the facts of physiology. Later yet, even some anatomi- 
cal facts can be made to serve a definite hygienic purpose, 
and thus anatomy may come in at the right time and by 
the right door. 
Errors in Treatment. — This inductive treatment of 
the subject, in obedience to the laws of mental growth, 
seems so simple that one might expect to find it in 
our schools. But, strangely enough, the psychological 
laws obeyed in treating other sciences are ignored 
when the subject is the human body. In the primary 
grades the instruction, as indicated by the text- 
books, consists in giving information about the body, 
chiefly anatomical, almost always uninteresting, and 
often misleading, interspersed with perfunctory advice 
in regard to hygiene and alcohol. The scientific method 
of the nature study lesson upon bird, beast, bug, or plant 
appears nowhere. 
In the higher grades, especially the high school, again 
anatomy is to the fore with scalpel, microscope, and acid 
bottle. In very few schools is the wonderful and beauti- 
ful human body, a living organism manifesting in every 
part adaptability, symmetry, and usefulness, so studied 
as to inspire respect and to suggest powerfully to the 
children normal health and beauty, and to secure obedi- 
ence to the laws of health because of the innate dignity 
and worth of the body, the home of the soul. 
Legislative Meddling. — How far this perversion of 
the subject, this retention of a method of instruction long 
since discarded in nearly every other subject, is due to 
legislative meddling it is impossible to say. Unques-
-P-A-G-E-214
  208 What Children Study and Why 
tionably, however, to a considerable degree the well- 
intended efforts of good people to secure a certain amount 
and kind of catechetical instruction in a subject of great 
ethical importance, by force of law inserted into the 
physiology books, has led both authors and teachers 
away from a sane and well-balanced view of the subject. 
The necessary artificiality and cumbersomeness of a part 
of the book has naturally affected the remaining parts. 
Two Points of View. — There are two points of view 
from which the subject may be considered, and in plan- 
ning a course of instruction both must be used. One is 
scientific, the other practical. The former considers 
the human body as in itself a proper object of study 
from the biological point of view like any other body. 
The other, regarding chiefly hygiene, has to do with 
the care of the body so that it may continue in a healthy 
state and may perform its functions normally. 
The acceptance of two points of view, while broaden- 
ing, is at the same time confusing. The question really is 
where to place the stress. If hygiene is kept in prominent 
relief before the eyes of the children, with science as a 
mere incident, getting its value from its relations to 
hygiene, we have one sort of results. If science is the 
manifest chief aim, with hygiene as a somewhat incidental 
though important corollary, we secure a quite different 
result. Which shall it be? Surely no — 
teacher can be in doubt. 
Dangers from Wrong Emphasis. — I am not sure but 
complete neglect of the subject would be better than a 
constant authoritative iteration of so-called laws of 
health. In the first place the “laws” whose efficacy 
is unquestioned are very few and can be taught simply,
-P-A-G-E-215
Physiology 209 
without spending much time and without the cumbersome- 
ness and the wastefulness incident to the usual teaching 
of “ physiology ” in the common school. To do more 
than this, with the stress on hygiene, is to center the 
thoughts of: children altogether too much upon their 
own bodies, by the influence of suggestion, and to cause 
the very evils it is desired to prevent. Excessive bodily 
self-consciousness is dangerous at any age. The un- 
happy hypochondriacs and the innumerable victims of 
all sorts of quackeries are largely men and women who 
have acquired the habit of giving constant attention to 
the “laws of health.” The thoroughly healthy person 
thinks little of either health or of possible disease. With 
children, excessive bodily self-consciousness produces 
even worse results. It arouses a morbid curiosity as to 
vital and sexual facts before they come normally into 
consciousness, and tends very definitely and surely to 
indecent and immoral practices. 
Untimely Knowledge. — I have considerable sympathy 
with the good woman who wrote to a teacher: “ Please 
excuse Jennie from physiology. I don’t think it is nice 
for her to learn about her insides.” Even important 
truths learned at the wrong time and without proper 
setting may be very mischievous. To this class belongs 
much of the information given to young children under 
the guise of “ hygiene,” relating to adult life and adult 
conditions, and not comprehensible by young children 
without distortion. This is the real ground for objection 
to the extreme requirements of the laws in some States 
regarding the teaching of ‘‘ temperance hygiene.” They 
overdo their office, so that children are supplied with 
facts, not only unnecessary to temperance or even total
-P-A-G-E-216
  210 What Children Study and Why 
abstinence, but likely to create morbid curiosity and pro- 
duce the evil they aim to remove. 
I recall one textbook, at one time at least highly 
approved and widely used, which distinctly, in so many 
words, advised teachers to bring to school samples of 
various alcoholic liquors and’ have children taste them, 
so that they might be able to distinguish them. One 
mother, the wife of a prominent minister and an ardent 
temperance advocate, said to me one day: “ My little 
girl (aged eight) came home from school to-day and told 
me about more kinds of liquors than I had ever heard 
of.” Another little girl said to her mother, “I hate 
physiology, but I just love the rum part.” 
Is it not evident that children so taught have a quite 
unnecessary and untimely knowledge of matters out of 
their natural ken, and that such knowledge is likely to 
do more harm than good? These excesses and dis- 
tortions follow inevitably a treatment of physiology 
directed mainly and manifestly from the practical or 
hygienic point of view. Such instruction tends to 
produce morbid bodily consciousness and unnatural 
curiosity. It leads directly to various forms of per- 
sonal immorality, and, besides, makes infants arbitrary 
and cocksure judges of adult actions. If has nothing 
to defend it, either educationally or ethically, except such 
good intentions as form the proverbial pavement of a 
certain unhappy region. ; 
What is the natural effect of teaching physiology from 
the scientific point of view with hygiene and ethics as 
inevitable and most important corollaries ? 
Basis of Character. — Let it be remembered that moral 
character results from experience more than from mere
-P-A-G-E-217
Physiology : 211 
preachment, that verbal knowledge as to right and wrong, 
with most people and on vital questions, is oneof the least 
influential forces in securing good conduct. The springs 
of conduct lie deeper than mere words. One of the great 
evils of all times is the substitution of external acquies- 
cence in verbal righteousness for deep-seated and high- 
principled morality. The too familiar bank defaulter 
who “stood high in religious circles’ is doubtless the 
result of this unconscious substitution and his subse- 
quent lack of defense against real temptation. A sane 
view of life in its entirety is surely better than the exag- 
gerated prominence of some single “ important fact.” 
Hence hygiene and “ bodily ethics ” should result natu- 
rally from a sane and suitable knowledge of the body. 
Without doubt the human body, the most highly 
organized form of animal life, is quite as worthy of study 
as the clam or the beetle. Moreover, it is always present 
for first-hand observation, the basis of all scientific 
study. : 
What to Study. — The study, for the younger children 
especially, should always be of visible form as related 
to function. Hence the external parts should be the 
first parts studied, and for a long time they should be 
almost the only parts considered. The slightest in- 
formation about internal structure, as a basis for some 
necessary hygienic lesson, will suffice. For example, 
the importance of saliva in preparing food for use in 
body-building may wisely be explained as an argument 
against chewing gum and against the vile habit of pro- 
miscuous spitting, so likely to be affected by boys at a 
certain age. Even in the grammar grades any attempt 
at an elaborate study of internal organs is to be depre-     
    
   
-P-A-G-E-218
212 What Children Study and Why 
cated. The study by observation of the corresponding 
organs of lower animals dissected in class is often of- 
fensive to sensitive children and can result in little good. 
In the primary grades the study of internal parts should 
be merely the most general and of vital organs, — suffi- 
cient to give support to what must be taught about the 
action of the circulatory system and its relation to ex- 
ercise, breathing, clothing, and fresh air. The digestive 
system and the nervous system should receive in school 
but the briefest attention, enough merely to point to 
certain very simple hygienic principles. The study of 
most of the visible external organs, however, is both 
easy and profitable. The hand, the foot, the skin, the 
eyes, ears, and teeth may all be studied so as to lead to 
proper respect and proper care. 
Scientific Method. — The method, it is needless to say, 
should be at first altogether scientific; that is, gather- 
ing facts by observation and inducing conclusions. A 
further characteristic of method should be the com- 
parison of the human organ studied with the correspond- 
ing organs of other animals. This not only makes the 
knowledge more definite and accurate, it gives the chil- 
dren a clear notion of the superiority of the human body 
and tends to enhance their respect for it, a necessary 
basis for hygiene and bodily morality. 
Study of the Hand.— Suppose you begin with the 
organ most easily studied, the hand: let the children 
observe their own hands, note all their parts and what 
they can do. Function explains and justifies structure. 
1 Mrs. E. B. Hallock, in her book, “Some Living Things,” has 
developed this method for children perhaps more fully than any other 
writer, 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
Physiology 213 
A number of lessons may well be spent in this study 
of the parts, possible positions, and functions of hands. 
How many joints are there, and what are they for? 
What uses do the nails serve? What can the fingers do, 
especially the thumb? Countless similar questions will 
stimulate curiosity and observation and lead directly 
to rules for the proper care of these wonderfully useful 
and beautiful organs. 
The interest in the study and the value of it may be 
greatly increased by a comparison with the parts of other 
animals corresponding to the hand, as the fins of fish, 
the wings of birds, the hoofs of horses and cattle, the 
paws of cats and dogs. The children can see readily the 
comparative inflexibility of the “hands” of these ani- 
mals and their consequent limitation, each to a single 
function or a comparatively few functions. The fin of 
the fish is for swimming only, the wing of the bird for 
flying. The adaptation in each case is perfect, but al- 
most absolutely confined to the single function. The 
hoofs of animals also have each a single adaptation, 
and a further partial usefulness in fighting. The paws 
of cat and dog have several uses. The hand of the mon- 
key has many, but not till we get to the hand of man, 
with its prehensile and supposable thumb, do we find 
universal adaptability. The advance from adaptation 
to adaptability, which includes pretty nearly the entire 
history of evolution, is easily shown in the study of the 
hand. Especial attention should be given to the thumb. 
The proverbial prominence of the “ sore thumb ” speaks 
volumes for man’s place in the cosmos. A history of 
thumbs and chins would be a history of later animal 
evolution.
-P-A-G-E-220
  214 What Children Study and Why 
Study of the Skin. — Another excellent study is the 
skin, —its uses, its delicacy and beauty, its relation to 
health, and its proper care. Here, too, comparative 
study is most helpful. The unprotected sensitive skin 
of man shows a great advance over the coarse, hair- 
covered skins of lower animals. It enables man by add- 
ing or removing artificial covering to live in all climates, 
whereas the lower animal is limited to a comparatively 
narrow sphere. The polar bear, being unable to remove 
his overcoat, must live where overcoats are “ comfort- 
able” the year around. Instruction in the care of the 
skin and in the avoidance of “ cosmetics”’ follows easily. 
These are suggested as typical methods of studying 
the parts of the body, so as to give genuine and useful 
knowledge as distinguished from verbal and_ useless 
memorization. They may be extended to cover all that 
it is wise to teach children about their bodies, and may 
lead easily to instruction in such laws of health and bodily 
morals as it is important to teach. 
“ Scientific Temperance.’’ — Where the law interferes 
and requires not merely more instruction but that of 
a wholly different kind, the teacher should try, in so far 
as possible, to make the instruction sensible and to avoid 
the evils so easily flowing from perfunctory ethical in- 
struction, especially when applied to disputed facts. 
As far as the laws allow, keep within the bounds of 
certainty. This offers a field wide enough for such in- 
struction as will tend to persuade children to let narcot- 
ics and stimulants alone. Keep in the background de- 
tailed instruction as to the constituents and qualities 
of “rum.” Keep in the foreground the beauty and 
utility of a normally healthy body and the dangers of 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  Physiology 215 
stimulation, especially in youth. Avoid general state- 
ments likely to lead children to criticize their elders and 
bring disrespect into families, and dwell instead upon 
the evils to which children in childhood are subject. 
Correlations of Hygiene.— Much of the necessary 
instruction in hygiene can be given in connection with 
other exercises, such as domestic science and gymnastic 
drill. With the former much can be taught in regard to 
food values, wholesome and unwholesome food, the 
proper manner of eating, and kindred topics. But the 
great field for correlation is the athletic or the gymnastic. 
In sports, physical vigor becomes an appreciable de- 
sideratum, not a mere abstraction, or a detestable school 
topic. If boys and girls are training for the basket-ball 
team or a foot race, or for any other contest requiring 
strength and endurance, it is not difficult to persuade them 
to bathe, to eat carefully, to sleep with their windows 
open, and to let chewing gum and cigarettes alone. The 
instructor in gymnastics, if such there be, is the best 
teacher of hygiene. He deals with the present, not the 
remote, with the child’s own ambitions and desires, not 
those of teacher and parent merely. The important laws 
of health are simple and easily followed, and if they are 
taught in connection with some appealing end in view, 
obedience to them can be made a habit, without danger 
of that morbidity which so frequently follows prolonged 
contemplation of our “ inward states.” Older children 
may be taught a few simple facts about the hygiene 
of the home, such as the importance of abundant fresh 
air and of sunshine, the necessity of cleanliness and the 
reasons for segregating those ill with infectious diseases. 
In all these respects the school itself should be a model,
-P-A-G-E-222
  216 What Children Study and Why 
a condition, alas, too seldom fulfilled. Both school 
officials and teachers are quite too frequently ignorant 
of the simplest laws of ventilation. Some have no 
“noses for foul air,” a serious defect in a teacher. 
- “Second hand ” air, with a certain peculiar nauseating 
odor, is one of the recognizable characteristics of the 
average schoolroom in many of our cities. In some cases 
patent systems of ventilation that work beautifully in 
theory are responsible for the lack of fresh air in school- 
rooms. In others where there are really effective sys- 
tems with forced draughts, teachers, ignorant of the 
possible difference between fresh air and cold air, apply 
the wrong remedy. 
Whatever the cause of foul air in a schoolroom, it should 
be remedied effectively and permanently. What greater 
absurdity is there than for children in the physiology 
class to be studying about the respiratory system and the 
purification of the blood, while themselves contaminating 
their own blood by breathing a choice mixture of carbon 
dioxide thrown off once or twice or thrice from the lungs 
of their neighbors, exudations from the unwashed bodies 
of the children about them, and disease germs “ too nu- 
merous to mention ”’? 
The air in the schoolroom should illustrate the prin- 
ciples laid down in the textbook not only for the sake 
of the children while in school, but also for the sake of 
its influences on the home. Children in the school should 
be made so sensitive to foul air that they will rebel against 
it in the home. 
Résumé. -— In general, let hygiene be hygiene, and not 
therapeutics. Treat the body as worthy of study and 
worthy of respect and of the best care. Let the instruc-
-P-A-G-E-223
  
Physiology 217 
tion be positive and suggestive, rather than negative 
and prohibitory. 
This ‘“‘ house beautiful,” the home of the human soul, 
is the highest of visible creations. When God, having 
made man’s body of the dust of the earth, breathed into 
it the breath of life, this body received a new dignity, 
unknown before. It should hence be kept pure and sweet 
and beautiful. Surely this is basis enough for instruc- 
tion in bodily morality. 
SEX HYGIENE 
In connection with the study of physiology it is per- 
haps well to devote a little space to a group of subjects 
which have been discussed of late vigorously, though 
somewhat vaguely, under the general heading, “ Sex 
Hygiene.” A number of moralists, and especially ad- 
vocates of the new so-called science of eugenics, urge that 
children in schools should be made acquainted with the 
principles of life reproduction, especially as applied to 
human beings, and that such instruction should be ex- 
tended to include the physiology and hygiene of the sex 
organs, to the end that children and youth may be taught 
how to keep these organs in good health, how to protect 
themselves against sex vices, and how to become in the 
end the right sort of parents. It will be seen that while 
these ‘subjects are closely related, they are after all 
different subjects. The writers who are urging their 
introduction into common school curricula seem, however, 
to suppose that they are all one subject, and that in- 
struction in the fundamental facts of life reproduction 
will lead so naturally to the more intensive knowledge 
of sex as to constitute a sure safeguard against prevalent
-P-A-G-E-224
  218 What Children Study and Why 
vicious habits, and against the social dangers that are 
related to sex. 
Importance of the Subject. — Beyond doubt, it would 
be well if discussion of sex relationship could be 
more general and easy than it is, provided that such 
discussion could be always hedged about with the 
proper restrictions and safeguards. If children could 
be made aware of the mode of propagating individual 
life in animals, as well as in plants, and be led to 
apply this knowledge to human beings, it would no 
doubt be valuable, and would save the growing genera- 
tion from many of the evils that are due to ignorance, to 
partial knowledge acquired in the wrong way, and to 
pruriency generally. Further, when children become 
older, particularly at the dawn of adolescence, if they 
could be made aware of certain well-known social dangers 
dependent upon sex, such knowledge probably would 
prove a valuable protection, again provided, as always, 
that it be imparted in the right way and by the right 
people, so as to create scientific interest and moral fear, 
but not to rouse prurient curiosity, or excite imagination 
and desire in young people at an age when such feelings 
are very near the surface. 
The Crux of the Question.— Here is the crux of 
the question as to the relation of the common school 
to such knowledge. One may admit without reserva- 
tion the value of knowledge of the sort indicated to 
the developing youth, and yet see in the introduction 
of these subjects into a common school course practical 
dangers and difficulties quite sufficient to outweigh 
the possible advantages. Indeed, I personally am 
quite strongly of the opinion that for the present at
-P-A-G-E-225
  
Physiology 219 
least instruction in this whole group of subjects must, 
in the public school, be limited to the very simplest 
and broadest facts of life-reproduction as shown in plants 
and in oviparous animals. The application to mammals 
of the principles so found out certainly cannot be carried 
very far at the present time in schools. These are my 
reasons : — 
Mixed Classes. — Most public schools have both boys 
and girls in the same classes. While this would not in- 
terfere with instruction based upon the study of plants 
and oviparous animals, as indicated above, such in- 
struction being naturally and properly given in the pri- 
mary grades, it would stop any further application to 
higher mammals, because such instruction to be of value 
would have to be given to the older pupils; that is, to 
the adolescents. Unhappily, in every school of advanced 
grade, a very considerable number of pupils already have 
considerable knowledge of sex relationship, for the most 
part obtained surreptitiously, and of the wrong sort. 
And such knowledge in case of definite instruction in sex 
hygiene would lead to unfortunate self-consciousness, and 
in many cases mutual consciousness, which would tend 
to inflame the imagination, and in addition would render 
the instruction very embarrassing to both teacher and 
pupils. The condition is very different from the im- 
aginary ideal condition, in which children from infancy 
are carefully guarded and given the right instruction at 
just the right moment, step by step, so that there is no 
evil imagination at any time. It is impossible to plan a 
scheme without taking account of the actual mental 
states of children, which involves much of the sort of 
knowledge of which I have already spoken. In those high 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
220 What Children Study and Why 
schools in which the sexes are separate, and in boarding 
schools of the same sort, it is possible that more definite 
instruction can profitably be given. Whether this is 
true in any particular case will depend upon local con- 
ditions, which do not admit of generalization. In small 
schools for pupils of but one sex, where the relations be- 
tween teachers and children are sound and wholesome, 
unquestionably some instruction of a healthful nature, 
on even the most intimate subjects, may be given. In 
larger schools the difficulty is greatly increased. It is 
almost safe to say it increases in geometrical ratio to the 
number of students, because of the moral influence of the 
transference of thought due to the presence of numbers, 
containing always some abnormally self-conscious as to 
sex, some morbid, and some vicious. 
Unfitness of Teachers. — The great danger from any 
general introduction of this important topic into com- 
mon schools, however, is in the teachers themselves. 
That does not mean that teachers are not moral. 
I believe that they are so beyond the members 
of most other professions. Not only are they con- 
ventionally moral, but they have high ideals and ex- 
alted standards of right and wrong, and are extremely’ 
conscientious. They undertake all imposed tasks, and 
would undertake this one, with the keenest sense of 
responsibility and the utmost desire to do good and not 
harm. But how many of them are qualified? We must 
take conditions as they are and not as we might desire 
them to be. A very large majority of the teachers of 
this country are very young women of little experience, 
and very meager knowledge outside the narrow field of 
the common school course of study. Many of them have
-P-A-G-E-227
  Physiology 221 
slight pedagogical skill and no pedagogical training. 
Many of them, probably a majority, are themselves very 
ignorant of those things that a eugenist would have 
them teach. Many of them are still adolescent and 
sexually self-conscious. Attempts on their part to give 
instruction on these matters, even in the simplest and 
broadest way, if they have in mind the relation of their 
instruction to the sex question, would greatly embarrass 
them. 
Grave Dangers. — It is to be feared that any general 
course of study in sex hygiene, to be administered 
through the usual channels and taught by the ordinary 
teachers of our common schools, instead of doing 
good would greatly magnify the evils aimed at, instead 
of decreasing them. Without imparting much _pro- 
tective knowledge, it would do that very dangerous 
thing, make young people prematurely conscious of 
sex. The instruction to be given, needful as it is, 
should be given only by those thoroughly familiar 
with the subject, and also wise, strong, and mature 
enough to impress young people without exciting 
them, or arousing undue curiosity. Such instructors, 
unhappily, in any system of schools, public or private, 
are very few. 
Regretfully, I have been convinced that for the present 
at least the necessary instruction beyond the very broadest 
facts of life reproduction must be given through some 
other agency than the common school. One thing, how- 
ever, might be done and should be done, — in normal 
schools and in all schools and colleges for the training of 
teachers, there should be very full and careful instruction 
in the subject of sex hygiene, sex relationship, and all
-P-A-G-E-228
Da se on oe Fee ET et TR ER BR IIR HEPES «Pe eR EE 
222 What Children Study and Why 
that has to do with the reproduction of life, by thoroughly 
qualified specialists, to the members of the sexes sepa- 
rately, so that the students going out to teach may have 
knowledge enough to guide them in whatever efforts they 
may find it possible to make toward leading their pupils 
to a wise and wholesome sex life. This is entirely possible, 
and would be the opening wedge. If we could in this 
way get each year a large body of well-equipped teachers 
qualified for this special phase of the work, possibly some 
of the other difficulties might be disposed of, because the 
one great difficulty in the way of the early introduction 
of sex hygiene into common schools is the lack of fitness 
of the teachers to do the work. 
School Physicians. — At the present day many school 
systems, especially in the larger cities, employ physi- 
cians to visit the schools, chiefly to discover the 
presence of contagious and infectious diseases. It is 
possible that in the high schools at least, and perhaps 
in the grammar schools, these physicians might add 
to their usefulness by talking to the boys and girls 
separately now and then upon certain solitary vices, 
and that such talks, in addition to checking these vices, 
might have a tendency to create wholesome thinking 
and feeling on the part of the boys and girls. 
What I have here outlined seems to me the limit of 
possibility within the near future’in regard to teaching 
the facts and principles of sex hygiene. If the time 
ever comes when the fundamental crucial facts of the 
reproduction of life can be taught to the young in such 
a way as to do more good than harm, it will be indeed a 
happy time. But I fear it will not arrive before the 
millennial days.

  CHAPTER XXI 
WRITING 
Writtnc is the most purely mechanical of all the arts 
taught in school. It has no esthetic value worth con- 
sidering and no intellectual value. Its sole function is 
to enable one to record his thoughts so that others may 
read them with the least effort. Because of its limited 
value in education, the time in learning to make this 
record should be reduced to the minimum. 
Children learn to write by writing, and most of the 
writing necessary for learning to write can be obtained 
in connection with the other school subjects. A little 
time spent upon the form and quality of the penmanship 
in ordinary written exercises in arithmetic, language, and 
other topics will obviate the necessity of devoting very 
much time to barren writing lessons. 
Too much “Fuss.” — There is altogether too much 
“fuss”? made over learning to write. There are but 
two essentials of good writing, legibility and speed. 
Beauty of form is of so little consequence to the 
ordinary person as to be negligible in education. 
Unquestionably that method of writing is the best 
that enables a child to learn to write legibly and 
rapidly, with the least possible expenditure of time and 
effort. It is doubtful if there is any such single method. 
There was much to be said in favor of vertical writing, 
now fallen into general disfavor. Children certainly 
223
-P-A-G-E-230
224 What Children Study and Why 
learned to use it with little effort and to write legibly. 
Second grade children could write their short sentences 
in vertical script, so that any one could read them easily, 
something that was unknown before its introduction. 
Whether the same good results will follow the general 
return to a modificd slant remains to be seen. 
The question of speed was never settled to the satis- 
faction of all, particularly of those who had writing books 
to sell. Many rapid writers use the vertical form, many 
use some other. It would seem to be chiefly a matter 
of the personal equation. 
Without doubt the chief criticism came from bankers 
and other men of the bookkeeper class, and was sheer 
prejudice in favor of the accustomed appearance of their 
account books. But be that as it may, any system that 
requires a great amount of time and attention to learn 
must justify its expenditure by better arguments than 
the “ looks ” of a ledger. 
Writing is necessarily copying. In teaching it, there is 
no possibility of induction, and but little of development, 
the only approach to it being the analysis of the letters 
into their constituent lines, and this analysis can be 
greatly overdone. 
Analysis of Letters. — Writing should begin with the 
copying of whole words, the same words that the child 
is learning toread. For a considerable time there should 
be no attempt at analysis, except the unconscious anal- 
ysis made by the child himself. Later, as difficulties 
manifest themselves, they should be met by some simple 
analysis and by drill on the troublesome forms. These 
will vary with the children. Hence the futility of any 
early general analysis of letters for whole classes.
-P-A-G-E-231
  Writing 225 
First Writing Large. — The first writing should be 
large, in full arm movements. The smaller muscles 
which control finger movements are developed rather 
late and they should not be forced. Blackboard 
writing is best at the start, in letters as large as 
the children please to make, the larger the better. 
This should be followed by writing with pencils on 
soft paper without rules, also in large letters. The 
pencils should be not less than one half inch in diameter 
and of good length, that the children may grasp them 
with their hands readily, and be compelled to use their 
arms to write with them. This should be followed by 
writing between rules not less than an inch apart. 
Gradually the size of the letters should be reduced to 
the normal, still with pencils on soft paper. 
The first pens used should be blunt, not sharp-pointed, 
to retain the free, large movements. By the third year 
children should be ready for ordinary pens on ruled or 
unruled paper. 
The cry about lack of individuality in penmanship 
after using any particular style, as the vertical, for ex- 
ample, is sheer nonsense. Individuality comes later, 
if it is in the individual. Any style learned in school is 
sure to be modified later by the user. 
Children can learn to write by almost any method, but 
loss of time in acquiring a ‘“ bookkeeper’s hand” in 
school is serious and there are things more worth while.

    CHAPTER XXII 
Motor ActTIviTIES IN EXPRESSION 
General Literacy Modern. — Time was when illiteracy ~ 
was no bar against admission to good society. Not 
only so, but literacy was regarded as a possession of 
doubtful value except as the key to a trade, something on 
a par with that of the smith. The average knight and 
lord of medieval days could scarcely read, if at all. Often 
he could not even write his name. He could fight, he 
could ride, he could dance, but reading and writing he 
cheerfully and somewhat contemptuously turned over to 
his menials. It was no more necessary for him to read 
his songs or write his letters than to shoe his horses or 
polish his armor. Indeed, he was much more likely to 
do the latter than the former. 
Have we gone too far in the opposite direction? In 
these days when the descendants of these same knights 
seek glory not on the gory field, v7 e¢ armis, but literis et 
stylis, in the field of letters despised of their fathers, when 
the public library as well as the schoolmaster is abroad, 
when everybody reads to his good or ill, when the 
blacksmith writes verses and the chambermaid novels, 
when the limerick contests appeal to the infant in arms — 
do we place too high a rating upon the use of words, 
in comparison with the other languages of the soul? 
Whatever may be the answer to this question, it can 
hardly be doubted that in our training of the young we 
226
-P-A-G-E-233
  Motor Activities in Expression 227 
have let our enthusiasm for those wonderful twin arts, 
which form the necessary mechanical basis for literature, 
close our eyes to the value of the other arts through which 
man expresses himself. We are word mad, and are so 
anxious that our youth be able to take to themselves the 
treasures of knowledge and thought and inspiration stored 
up in the world’s literature that we forget to open their 
eyes to those other treasures, contained in the buildings, 
the sculpture, the paintings, the music, the machinery of 
the world. 
On what principle of common sense can we justify this 
exaltation of speech, “ the art of concealing thought,” 
so far above all other forms of expression ? 
Value of the Doer.—In the great busy world, we value 
the doer, the man who expresses himself in a machine, 
a house, a temple, a painting, a statue, a mill, a railroad, 
a bank, an asylum, a lighthouse. They are the honored 
of all ages. But in our definition of what we call edu- 
cation we set up and smugly defend the little two by four 
image of clay which we call literacy. Then we fall down 
and worship it and call upon all people to bow before our 
little god or be sent to social perdition. A man may 
build factories, cities, nations, but unless he is “up” on 
Ibsen he is uneducated. 
Iam not ignorant of the many attempts to remedy this 
defect that have struggled for recognition for thirty years 
past with varying success. The “object lessons” the 
“manual training,” the occasional attention to appre- 
ciative study of the fine arts, — all are indications of a 
real, if vague, sense of lack in our curricula. But these 
efforts as yet have been sporadic and undigested and too 
often ephemeral.
-P-A-G-E-234
  228 What Children Study and Why 
Courses out of Balance. — We still must ask ourselves 
whether our courses of study are not out of balance, 
whether having secured the irreducible minimum of liter- 
acy, —ability to read and write effectively, — the remain- 
ing time should not be distributed more nearly in accord- 
ance with the values of the other matters that may be 
taught. We have greatly extended the average of school 
attendance, but the extension of work has been nearly all 
along one line. Do we need a reform? 
Two Phases of Every Course. — As stated in Chapter 
I, every course of study necessarily represents two phases 
of education: a body of knowledge to be learned, and a 
range of activities, to secure through expression the re- 
actions necessary, not only to learning itself, but what 
is even more important, to the growth of the mind. 
These two phases are naturally complementary, and 
hence, although the specific topic of this chapter is the 
latter phase, that of expression, and a single aspect of 
that, this brief consideration of the other phase seems to 
me necessary as an introduction. 
All Arts Necessary. — In the economy of life all the 
arts have their place. He who can read the “ sermons 
in stones ” and the rest of it; he to whom Nature “ speaks 
a various language ”’; he who looks with eye of apprecia- 
tion upon the Taj Mahal; he who can feast his mind 
upon the beauties of a Venus de Melos or a Transfigura- 
tion; he’ who is intelligently and deeply moved by “‘con- 
cord of sweet sounds,” surely he has a valuable education, 
even though his knowledge of literature be meager. 
And more, he who can read comprehendingly and with 
pleasure a locomotive, a turbine steamer, an electric 
lamp, a telephone, a wireless outfit, or even a compli-
-P-A-G-E-235
  Motor Activities in Expression 229 
cated tool, a piece of furniture, a boot, a suit of clothes, 
has his compensations for lack of literary training. He 
can put himself as really into communication with the 
efforts of some fellow-man to express the best that is in 
him as by reading a poem. Truly then, when we have 
passed the irreducible minimum of literacy, we need to 
consider well whether the children should not be led to 
the contemplation of more varied and richer knowledges 
than are contained in any merely verbal record. 
Range of Activities. — This leads directly to the range 
of activities suggested for the course of study. Of what 
expressive arts should the child be put in possession, and 
why? 
Why teach Arts of Expression. — Why teach any 
arts of expression? The first reason is really sub- 
conscious. It is of the nature of instinct that children 
should be instructed into the modes of being and doing 
of the race. Hence training in expressive activities al- 
ways and naturally precedes the imparting of formal 
knowledge and the earliest knowledge imparted is that 
which bears upon and illumines the activities. The 
educative business of the infant is to kick, to creep, to 
walk and talk, to cry and make up faces. Knowledge is 
incidental and auxiliary. For a long time he cares to 
know only or chiefly that which will help him directly 
to do something. He learns to do many things, in imita- 
tion of his elders and to gratify his desires, while his 
knowledge, except as directly related to his activities, is 
practically nil. That is, he falls without effort into the 
life of the race, and begins to do his part as a member 
of it; for the great business of the race is to do things. 
Records, talk about it, are subsidiary or supplementary.
-P-A-G-E-236
  230 What Children Study and Why 
So the instinct of the savage in training his child to do 
the things that he does, in putting him in possession of 
the arts, the expressive activities of his people, and the 
instinct of the young mother, alike innocent of psy- 
chology and pedagogy, who dances her baby and, as soon 
as possible, encourages him to do his utmost to make 
himself known and felt and heard, are alike sound, alike 
in consonance with the evolution of man and the highest 
achievements of the race. 
Caution to Teachers. — And we teachers need to be 
very sure of our ground before we switch the child off 
abruptly from this normal, natural, time-honored train- 
ing into an empirical, unnatural searching for mere 
knowledge without the accompanying and vivifying ac- 
tivity. To take a child of six who has been educating 
himself in active games, using, abusing, breaking toys, 
making mud pies, constructing trains of cars, building 
block houses, living a real life, and plant him in a desk 
made for sitting still, and stuff him with words, repress- 
ing his natural activities, is admittedly a crime against 
nature. But it does not cease to be a crime when he is 
twelve years old in a grammar school or sixteen in a high 
school. To such unwise, unnatural, artificial attempts 
to violate the eternal laws of development are due much 
of the “ badness,”’ the uneasiness, and the stupidity of 
children in school, which move teachers to exasperation, 
parents to despair, and the children themselves to law- 
lessness, hatred of school, and truancy. So this first 
reason why we should teach expressive activities may be 
called racial. 
Reaction Necessary. — The second reason is to pro- 
vide the reaction necessary to learning. It may be
-P-A-G-E-237
  Motor Activities in Expression 231 
called the psychological reason. It is a truism that there 
is no learning without reaction. The impression that 
neither is accompanied by vivifying expression nor rests 
upon previous expression is either wholly barren or 
hopelessly and often ludicrously erroneous. 
The Rigmarole.— Disregard of this great fact in 
teaching is responsible for the rigmarole, that most 
wasteful and deadening of school methods, — though 
quite common, — the learning and reciting of words in 
an established order, without thought. We little ap- 
preciate the absurd interpretations often put upon 
wordy rigmaroles memorized and so glibly reeled off 
by the children as to delude us into the belief that 
they comprehend what they say. Doubtless we can all 
recall from our own childhood these absurd notions 
drawn from words that we used in our school recitations 
and perhaps especially in prayers and other religious 
exercises. The well-worn “consecrated cross-eyed bear” 
story is no exaggeration. 
Knowledge without expression is no knowledge. 
Reciting words about an idea is not necessarily ex- 
pressing the idea at all and may not indicate the 
slightest conception of the idea. In the use of no 
other form of possible expression is deception so easy 
or so common. This is one reason why it is so 
necessary to employ many kinds of expression in the 
training of children. 
Dr. John Dewey’s experience in getting desks for the 
children in his experimental school shows how sadly 
devoted we are to apply the analogy of the tub to the 
child mind. ‘“ Every child is a tub, whose function is 
to sit still while the teacher pours into it a stream of
-P-A-G-E-238
  232 What Children Study and Why 
useful knowledge, and a good tub does not leak. More- 
over, wisdom is like to good wine. Its perfection comes 
through resting long in quiet places. To cause it to 
move about prevents the settling of the lees.” Upon 
such philosophy is a large part of our educational struc- 
ture founded. 
Why do Children learn slowly in School? — The in- 
fant creeps, kicks, dances, screams, strikes, plays, 
imitates, goes through millions of antic activities 
that would tire an adult to death, and through 
it all grows and learns with a rapidity almost mi- 
raculous. When this baby comes to school why does 
he learn so slowly? If a teacher could keep the in- 
tellectual growth of the children in school at even ap- 
proximately its rate before coming to school, he would 
be exhibited as a freak. 
The best in our best schools is natural baby activity 
utilized and extended. This is found in the kindergarten 
and in the rare but occasional primary school. Its secret 
is expression, natural, free, varied, and abundant expres- 
sion—as the antecedent, the consequent, the accom- 
paniment, the vitalizing force of impression. It is with 
knowledge as it is with life; the more we put into it of 
effort, of vital force, the richer we are in possession, in 
power. 
The Practical Reason. — The third reason for treat- 
ing expressive activities as fundamental in the training 
of children is the practical one. The more numerous 
the means of expression open to a human being, the 
greater the possibility of ‘his rendering efficient service 
in life, the less the likelihood of his being “ a square peg 
in a round hole.” We teach children that the doer is
-P-A-G-E-239
  Motor Activities in Expression 233 
greater than the recorder, the warrior than the minstrel 
who sang his deeds, but we ¢rain children only in the 
lesser art. Each child is entitled to a training in the 
particular art of expression through which he can best 
express his best. For all the arts are but avenues of 
expression, through which men send the output of their 
souls to their fellow-men. Everything we do expresses 
ourselves in some degree. But the expression is often 
inadequate and unconvincing because we have not 
mastered the art that is best for us. We need a recasting 
of values and a study of adaptation. The great successes 
of the world are attained when men of rich natures have 
discovered the means, best for them, of distributing their 
riches. Indeed, individual success is almost wholly de- 
pendent upon finding means of expression, adequate and 
personally suitable. 
If Sir Christopher Wren had tried to express himself 
in poetry instead of in stone, probably the world would 
have had some more poor verses and certainly no St. 
Paul’s cathedral. 
Do we not owe it to the children to give them such 
familiarity with the various expressive arts that each 
may both find the one that is best for him and besides 
may have at his command as auxiliary other arts for the 
enrichment of life and the widening of opportunity? Is 
our modern education in danger of dwindling, like Echo, 
to a mere voice? 
Why Motor Activities. — Why should the expressive 
activities that are to receive emphasis in schools be motor 
activities? First, perhaps, because of a sort of necessary 
elimination. Practically all expressive activities ex- 
cepting those involved in verbal expression are motor
-P-A-G-E-240
  
234 What Children Study and Why 
activities. So if we are to increase the number, we must 
perforce include the motor activities. But this of itself 
speaks volumes. It seems as if Nature had sought to 
make it impossible to avoid any neglect of these agencies 
in education. If that was her intent, she did not take 
sufficient account of the ingenuity of the schoolmaster. 
Give us half a chance and we will beat Nature every time, 
both vitiating her method and defeating her purposes. 
But there are special reasons in the nature of the mind 
itself why the motor activities are all-important for the 
very act of learning and consequently for all mental 
growth. The exercise of the motor activities com- 
bines in a most remarkable manner the fulfillment of 
its manifest function, —that of expressing thought, 
—with the development of mental power in the in- 
dividual. The reasons for this are both scientific and 
practical. 
Brain Areas. — The physiological psychologist will 
tell you of extensive brain areas in which the termini of 
the afferent and efferent nerves affecting motor action, 
observation, reasoning, and verbal expression are so 
closely related as to produce the utmost harmony of ac- 
tion. Whether as the result of some transference of 
power similar to electrical induction, or because of an 
actual physiological union, there seems to be an inter- 
change of stimulation, so that one cannot act without 
rousing the others to activity. 
Herein is the explanation of many common phe- 
nomena. Natural gesture, which necessarily preceded 
speech as a means of expression, and almost always ac- 
companies it unless artificially restrained, is due merely 
to these transferred currents.
-P-A-G-E-241
  Motor Activities in Expression 235 
Thinking is always naturally, and almost always prac- 
tically, accompanied by an attempt at expression, both 
in words and in motor activity. This, too, is due to the 
constitution of the brain, which imperatively demands 
motor expression, especially in the young, as a condition 
to thinking itself, and hence to all brain development. 
Moreover, in this federation of nerve termini the motor 
nerves seem to dominate. If they are or become inert, 
the brain loses its other activities and dies. The child 
born without motor power is always an idiot. His 
earliest means of expressing himself being lacking, he 
never arrives at the later ones. He never has any con- 
scious self to express. 
Motor Activity and the Defective.—On the other 
hand, a child almost idiotic, but with enough motor power 
to utilize for educational purposes, by a carefully ordered 
system of motor expressive activities, may be raised 
from the plane of the hopelessly defective into that of the 
fairly intelligent and intellectually capable. Indeed, the 
training of the motor activities is the main reliance of all 
those institutions for the feeble-minded that have rescued 
from mental darkness and economic helplessness so 
many thousands of the “ Born Shorts.”’ And this is all 
made possible by that marvelous clearing house of nerve 
activities in the brain. Truly a force so mighty for good 
should not be ignored in the training of the normal child. 
Nature utilizes it first and chiefly in her development of 
the infant. All people everywhere in all ages have put 
their reliance upon it for the development of the young, 
—all but the schoolmaster. We, the professional 
teachers of youth, in all ages and peoples, have inclined 
to limit our training of the young to that which can 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 What Children Study and Why 
be obtained through some form of logomachy, the ut- 
terance and arrangement of words. But fortunately, 
Nature has kept right on working in spite of us. 
Of recent years there has been much evidence of a re- 
turn to the ways of Nature. It is manifested in manual 
training courses, manual training schools, trade and in- 
dustrial schools of various sorts, systematic physical 
culture, and occasionally a rational and scientific co- 
ordination of developmental motor activities with other 
means of rousing and expressing thought, as a funda- 
mental part of the educational scheme. But such co- 
ordination is as yet sporadic and unusual. 
Lack of Coérdination. —In most schools the motor 
exercises constitute an uncodrdinated and seldom un- 
derstood addendum to an already crowded curriculum. 
While few teachers nowadays have the courage to: say 
that they do not believe in manual training, few have a 
really clear notion of what it is for. The most vibrate 
between its industrial and occupational values and what 
they call its “‘ educational” usefulness, insisting, however, 
with the blind certainty of instinct, that the educational 
use is the real one. These values, however, are put for- 
ward as excuses rather than as imperative reasons. 
The industrial reason is valid and powerful and does 
not need to be advanced apologetically. That manual 
training exercises make it easier for the average child to 
find himself and his place and to make a better living, 
because he does something worth more to the world than 
would be possible without such training, is a perfectly 
proper argument which does not need to blush for its own 
existence, and is in itself a quite sufficient ground for 
all the manual training now in the schools and more.
-P-A-G-E-243
  
Motor Activities in Expression 237, 
Meaning of ‘‘ Educational.’’ — But the educational value 
is not so easily understood. The very term educational 
is conveniently indefinable. Hence it is a handy cover- 
ing for a multitude of sins and idiosyncrasies in teach- 
ing. It is the universal shield of the ignorant and hard- 
pressed. When the father says, “I don’t want John to 
study music. It ain’t practical,” all the teacher has to 
do is to look wise and say, “ Of course, Mr. Smith, it 
may not be very practical, but it’s very educational,” 
and she has Mr. Smith down and out. “ Educational ” 
is a great word. To the teacher it is both shibboleth 
and conjure word. It is as effective as Sydney Smith’s 
“yectangular parallelopipedon ” with which he silenced 
the old woman calling him names. 
Now, of course, all motor activities that deserve a place 
in school are educational and that is the chief reason for 
having them there. They are educational as all the 
natural activities of life, especially those with a definite 
motive, are educational. They enable the developing 
soul to express itself and by that act to grow. Thisis 
simple, psychological, and plain. We grow through 
expression. Impression, learning, gives us the ma- 
terial, but it’s expression, putting forth, exercise, — call 
it what you will,—that works the external fact into 
knowledge, an internal condition of growth, and also 
makes room and creates the demand for more and 
more material. We might as well try to make flour by 
pouring wheat into a motionless hopper as to make 
mind by pouring facts into an expressionless child. 
Hence if we are to get the real value of motor activities, 
they must not be tacked on the week’s work in school as 
an extra, placed there by sufferance, but they must be a
-P-A-G-E-244
  238 = What Children Study and Why 
codrdinated and fundamental part of the regular work, 
as really so as is language expression. 
To make for real comprehension of the content sub- 
jects of the curriculum, such as history, geography, arith- 
metic, and to secure the highest and most permanent 
results from them, expression through motor activities 
must be secured regularly and systematically. 
If you doubt this and have never tried it, do so as an 
experiment. Be honest with yourself and open minded 
about it. First think why it is so or may be so. The 
thing you have made you understand. The muddy 
notions too often left by words are all made clear when 
with brush or pencil, or other tools, you have realized 
your idea. With a child this is doubly true. The thing 
he has made even crudely is the thing he knows. This 
is the philosophy of all the constructive work of the kin- 
dergarten and primary school. It is not necessary even 
that the thing made resemble very closely, to another’s 
eye, the object supposed to be represented. To the child 
it is the thing. He sees it. His hands have made it. 
It may be a house, or a bridge, or a rainbow, made with 
kindergarten blocks; to the maker it stands for an idea, 
and the making of it has made that idea clear to him as 
words could not do. By that mysterious process of the 
conservation of energy through interchange, his ex- 
penditure of motor energy in construction has brought 
- about a more active and efficient exercise of his brain, 
and while the world may not have benefited directly by 
his action, his own mind has been strengthened and 
enriched by the reaction. The child has learned, not 
by listening to a description in words, but by expressing 
through motor activities his embryonic idea. Through
-P-A-G-E-245
Motor Activities in Expression 239 
this attempt at expression, his glimmering of an impres- 
sion has become clear comprehension. 
School Possibilities. — Is. it possible to have in the 
ordinary school such a coérdination of motor activities 
with the existing course of study as shall not add to the 
crowding, but rather shall furnish relief by supplying an 
essential connecting element that is clarifying, stimu- 
lating, developing, and harmonizing? Can we in our 
teaching of language, history, and geography and the 
other topics, make use of that marvelous unifying agency 
in the brain of which we have spoken? 
My answer is, not only can it be done, but it is easy; 
it would simplify many now troublesome problems, and 
it requires no new machinery. Indeed, it makes it 
possible to lessen the amount of machinery in use. It 
requires simply a certain freedom from convention, the 
_ courage of our convictions, and common sense, the 
bringing into the schoolroom of some of the practical 
wisdom of the home and the playground. 
The Language Lesson. — Language is perhaps more 
nearly than any other a central subject, and serves best 
asanillustration. The teaching of language has a lower 
and a higher function, indeed several of them. The 
lower function is to acquaint the children with the rules 
of conventionally correct speech. The higher include 
truthfulness, clearness, and fluency of speech, and, what 
is even greater, the same qualities of thought. The lower - 
function is the one most in the minds of teachers. The 
method is by rule and example. That the method 
usually fails to secure the result aimed at is not my 
present point; I am more concerned with the higher 
aims of the subject. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  240 What Children Study and Why 
If the higher ends of language instruction are looked 
after, —the stimulation of good thinking and its clear, 
forceful, accurate, and fluent expression, — the habit of 
conventionally correct speech may be formed easily 
through such expression. 
If the lower end only is looked after in the usual way, 
not only will the higher ends perforce suffer neglect, but 
the lower end itself, the habit of conventionally correct 
speech, will fail of attainment. 
It is evident that clear thinking is necessary to efficient 
expression. Aside from a merely verbal knowledge of 
the conventions of speech, it is absolutely impossible to se- 
cure good language results without at the same time se- 
curing good thinking. The two are inseparable. Here 
is the occasion for a rational use of the motor activities. 
Here the teachers may utilize their extraordinary power 
to clarify thought and may make manual training a real 
educational force in daily school work. Suppose you 
are a primary teacher and are to have an oral lesson in 
which you want the children to talk fluently and well, 
thus acquiring correct language habits. You choose 
the story of Joseph. You first try to give the pupils 
‘the proper stock of knowledge, the necessary mental 
picture. You talk to them, you tell them the story, you 
describe the life of the nomad in the wilderness, and later 
the life at the Egyptian court. You paint word pictures 
of Asiatic and Egyptian scenery. Perhaps if the children 
are old enough, you have them read in books about it 
all. You carry on the study through a series of lessons. 
But you never know what the words used mean to the 
children. Your description of Oriental life may produce 
such responses as that of the boy who, after learning a
-P-A-G-E-247
  Motor Activities in Expression 241 
definition of the equator, described it as a “ menagerie 
lion, running around the middle of the world.”’ How can 
you make sure? Use the motor activities. Let the 
children represent Joseph in his various environments 
in some tangible material. It makes little difference how 
crude and simple the material is. A long table in each 
primary schoolroom is almost essential to clear mental 
pictures and good language. It is better that the table 
be what is usually called a “sand table,” and it should 
contain slightly moistened sand for manipulation. 
The children will supply gladly all the articlesnecessary, 
such as dolls and other toys, or better, objects made di- 
rectly by hand from clay or wood or paper, —and working 
as you tell the story, from day to day, they will at the end 
have a panorama marvelous in its inclusiveness, but a 
source of very great pleasure to them and a stimulant to 
thought and its expression. They will then have no vague 
ideas about the story. The mental picture will be clean- 
cut and definite, and they will talk both fluently and well. 
Their brains will have received great stimulation. The 
language founts will be very near. The words used by 
the teacher in telling the story will be ineffaceably im- 
pressed upon the mind and will be used by the children. 
I have seen third-grade children of foreign extraction 
talk from a sand table on the story of Beowulf a half hour 
at a stretch each, in good English and with absorbing in- 
terest, and the use of the motor activities made it pos- 
sible. 
The same principle applies to history, to geography, 
to arithmetic, to all subjects capable of illustration by 
the pupils. 
It is perhaps easier to employ such illustrative ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  242 What Children Study and Why 
ercises in the primary grades, where there is compara- 
tively little differentiation of subject, but a little care 
will find means for the use of this great principle in all 
grades. 
| Arithmetic.—In arithmetic the opportunities are 
many. Practically all the work in denominate numbers, 
and especially in mensuration, can be greatly simplified 
and strengthened by suitable motor exercises. 
I recall a visit to the School of Education of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago when Colonel Parker was its head. 
That great teacher understood and utilized the place 
of motor expression in clarifying thought. The arith- 
metic classes were building a playhouse on the school 
ground. All the operations were carried on by the chil- 
dren. They bought the lumber and other material, 
at least theoretically, cut, sawed, fitted the parts, and 
literally built the house. The work called also for a very 
considerable practical knowledge of financial transac- 
tions, and it is safe to say that that knowledge was real 
rather than verbal. Those facts of mensuration and 
finance were sawed, hammered, and planed into the 
children’s minds by their own activities, and could not 
be forgotten. 
Geometry. — As I recall, my attention was first 
directed to this principle years ago in one of the earliest 
and best of the now numerous manual training high 
schools. Because of its newness the progress of its pupils 
was carefully watched in comparison with that of pupils 
in the old high school pursuing the same subjects. It 
was found that in mathematics they easily far out- 
stripped the academic pupils. This was especially true 
in geometry. The reason was manifest. They were
-P-A-G-E-249
  Motor Activities in Expression 243 
dealing with geometric problems in the concrete, em- 
ploying motor activities. So that it required no effort 
on their part to see the relations of geometrical magni- 
tudes, because they had not only felt them, they had 
worked them out and produced them with their hands. 
Physical Culture. — There is another form of motor 
expression possessing great possibilities which have been 
thus far quite generally overlooked. I refer to what is 
popularly called “ physical culture.” It has been com- 
mon for years for pupils in schools to be put through 
various calisthenic exercises, to relieve the tedium of 
long sitting, to discharge overcrowded nerve centers, and 
in general to accord with the dictum that exercise is 
“good for” the children. These are sound reasons, 
and the exercises have served, no doubt, a very useful 
purpose. But they have fallen very far short of their 
legitimate function of giving effective and graceful ex- 
pression to thought and feeling. Like manual training, 
physical culture has been tacked on the course of study 
as an extra instead of being coérdinated with it as both 
a stimulant and a means of expressing thought. In a 
few progressive schools and systems of schools attempts 
have been made at a proper codrdination of physical 
culture with the other studies, with remarkable results. 
The work done in the Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, that by Miss Belle R. Parsons in Los Angeles, 
and that by Miss M. B. Newton in Rochester, N.Y., 
show what may be accomplished with little extra effort. 
Gesture, the Earliest Language.— And why not? 
Gesture is the earliest of languages. There are few 
emotions or thoughts that may not be expressed in 
gesture. Few people can talk at all without gesture.
-P-A-G-E-250
  
244 What Children Study and Why 
The natural gestures of the baby are accurate as well as 
graceful. Anger, love, hunger, joy, content, are all 
plainly manifested without the utterance of a word. 
Pantomime and Drama. — Under proper instruction, 
this use of the body to express thought has received 
a very high development among specialists. The pan- 
tomime is merely organized gesture. We have the high- 
est development of gesture in the drama, where it is co- 
ordinated with expression in words, and in the opera, 
where it is allied with vocal and instrumental music to 
express the deepest and the loftiest emotions. 
All these phases of motor expression in simplified 
form may be used with propriety in the schools. Dances 
representing national customs in connection with history, 
games of all sorts dear to the young, movements repre- 
senting in rhythmic pantomime the various industries 
of men, tableaux vivants, showing modes of motion in 
nature, as the undulatory movements of the sea and the 
air, the flowing of water, the waving of trees and of fields 
of grain, the locomotion of beasts, the flight of birds, and 
many more, introduced into school, will illumine the 
various subjects of the curriculum and afford a useful 
outlet for the child’s natural love of self-expression, be- 
sides furnishing good exercise. 
The Drama in School. — One of the best exercises in 
connection with the study of history, of language, and 
of literature is the drama. Plays made and acted by 
the pupils, representing the stories they read, the events 
of history, the activities that they describe in words, so 
clarify impression as to render the facts learned unforget- 
able, while giving the children the advantage of express- 
ing themselves in the most complete manner possible.
-P-A-G-E-251
Motor Activities in Expression 245 
Instances could be multiplied without number, show- 
ing how the motor activities may be employed in school, 
not as extra exercises, burdening both teacher and pupils 
with a new subject, but rather, illumining and reénforc- 
ing the standard subjects now in the curriculum and at 
the same time bringing joy and freedom into the daily 
tasks and changing drudgery into alluring and fasci- 
nating employment. 
Reform Needed. — Our entire scheme of manual train- 
ing and physical culture must be recast along the lines 
of the expression of thought and feeling, Manual train- 
ing has made long strides in that direction already. 
The meaningless exercise of the early day is rapidly dis- 
appearing, and pupils make things for a purpose, to 
express some thought or feeling. But this thought or 
feeling is too often artificial, worked up for the occasion, 
to give excuse for the exercise, instead of being a vital 
idea forcibly demanding utterance. 
Physical culture has not yet moved clearly in the direc- 
tion of common sense, except in here and there a school. 
The exercises are still exercises merely, sawing the unresist- 
ing air or contorting the body into ungraceful shapes 
with no manifest motive beyond that of mere exercise. 
But the time is coming when manual training will be 
a regular part of the thought-developing and thought- 
expressing machinery of the common school, when every 
exercise will be an aid to the solution of a pressing school 
problem, when the children will express their ideas as 
naturally with saw or plane or hammer, or pencil, or 
brush, or chisel, operating on solid material, as with the 
glib tongue uttering articulated breath or with the pen 
making symbols on a white plane. 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  
| 
246 What Children Study and Why 
And physical culture will be the expression in graceful, 
symbolic movements of genuine thought and feeling, the 
gesture developed to include countless expressive move- 
ments, the dance representing in graceful symbolism 
the rhythmical movements of nature, — air, ocean, trees, 
and streams, — and of the animals, and also the activities 
and industries of man; and last and highest of all, the 
drama, and these not treated as separate exercises but 
as drawn from and related to the life and education of 
the child, clarifying and illumining the dark places of 
the school.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 
Motor activities as applied to the work of the school 
fall naturally into two classes, the educational and the 
industrial. These names are, however, inexact and to 
a degree misleading, inasniuch as all activity, especially 
all school activity, iseducational. Moreover, there is no 
fundamental reason why training for manual industry 
should not be educational in the broadest sense. 
Industrial Training also Cultural. — The old type of 
training, supposed to be to the fullest degree cultural, — 
that obtained through the study of the humanities, — had 
for its aim one of a very small number of definite gainful 
occupations, law, theology, or medicine. True, they 
were not manual activities, but that does not affect the 
principle. For training for a manual occupation prop- 
erly conducted is mind training and to be most effective 
must include a very wide culture. Manual dexterity 
is only a minor result of the best manual training, even 
when directed toward a specific occupation. The trained 
mind is as necessary to the highest success in wood work- 
ing or iron working as in surgery. So industrial train- 
ing to be highly effective must be chiefly cultural. 
Indeed, one of the strongest arguments for the right 
kind of industrial training, though one frequently 
overlooked, is that it lifts the hand worker from the 
247 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
248 What Children Study and Why 
plane of the mere mechanic to that of the thinker, using 
his trained mind, to get better mechanical results, it is 
true, but also able to use it to meet the broader de- 
mands of life. It produces not merely better mechanics, 
but better men. Ina free state the man before the ma- 
chine is as important as in war the man behind the gun. 
Distinction Inevitable. — Still in our planning for 
training the motor activities in school, we do necessarily 
make a distinction as to the aim. There is a marked 
difference between what in school parlance we call 
“ manual training ” and what we call “ industrial train- 
ing.” 
The former aims definitely at broad general culture, 
the hand work being merely one of the means employed 
to that end, and the relation of the training to specific 
gainful occupations being merely incidental. Whereas 
in industrial training the specific calling is definitely 
to the fore, any cultural effect being the incident. In the 
former, hand training is to give the pupil new modes of 
self-expression, to enlarge his acquaintance with life, 
and to develop those areas of the brain that lie fallow 
unless stimulated into productivity through motor 
activity, and thus to make it easier for him to know his 
own aptitudes. It opens to him a larger world of possible 
work. In the latter the aim is specifically to train car- 
penters or blacksmiths or cooks or what not. 
Industrial Training in America Late. — In America 
recognition of the importance of industrial training in 
schools arrived late, growing out of pressing industrial 
and social conditions, real or imaginary, such as the 
restrictions placed upon apprenticeship by the labor 
unions so that few native-born children can enter the
-P-A-G-E-255
  Industrial Training 249 
ranks of skilled manual labor, and the real or supposed 
filling of the ranks of the unemployed with boys and girls 
from the schools. 
At first such training by the state was regarded with 
almost universal suspicion. Those of us who were 
active in introducing manual training into school 
twenty years or more ago were compelled to explain 
very carefully that it was not intended to fit children 
for trades, but that the aim was purely educational. 
We had to point out over and over again that we 
were merely giving the children a broader culture 
and to show that they did better in their other studies 
because of the stimulus received from work at the bench. 
Much was said of the dormant brain areas, to be 
awakened only through muscular activity. This was 
especially necessary when we tried to introduce manual 
training into the grade schools. 
Sewing and Cooking first “ Industrial” Subjects. — 
It was the introduction of sewing and cooking for girls 
that really paved the way for industrial training as such. 
Here it was necessary to lay greater stress upon the 
“ practical”? value of the instruction given, — how it 
made better housekeepers and better homes. Thus the 
minds of intelligent people, including boards of education, 
were prepared to accept the practical arguments in 
favor of teaching trades to boys. 
The general value of teaching the various manual arts 
has perhaps already been sufficiently stated. It now 
remains to discuss industrial training specifically. And 
truly some things need to be said very plainly indeed. 
Danger of Extremes. — We are so prone to rush to 
extremes. Sometimes Iam tempted to think that we are
-P-A-G-E-256
    250 What Children Study and Why 
in danger of losing our sense of proportion, our sanity, 
over this question of industrial training. There are 
those among us who apparently would turn all our schools 
into shops, who would put the hand before the brain and 
would sacrifice all the results of the devoted labors of 
those who have built up our magnificent system of high 
schools offering to all boys and girls the blessing of a 
liberal culture. 
The Age of Choice.—One of the chief dangers of 
this extreme course is that of forcing young boys and 
girls into the choice of their life work long before they 
are competent to make such choice. Even many college 
graduates have not yet found themselves and are un- 
certain as to what work they should choose. We can 
all recall the various stages that we passed through be- 
fore arriving at our destination, and some of us doubt- 
less are not now sure that that destination is the proper 
one. 
Compelling children in the grammer school to make 
such choices is sure to increase the number of square 
pegs in round holes. It is not a variation of broad 
manual training, it is its antipode. Instead of helping 
the young to a knowledge of their aptitudes it closes 
the door of such opportunity to them. 
Of course these extreme views are not held by the 
better thinkers, the real leaders of the movement; but 
there is enough of such talk abroad, some of it uttered 
by those high in educational authority, to demand 
caution and clear statement of purpose. No one must 
be allowed to think that the leaders of educational 
thought desire to substitute farm schools, or cooking 
schools, or millinery schools, or shops of any sort, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  
Industrial Training 251 
high schools and colleges, even those of the most purely 
intellectual and scholarly type. 
Danger to Democracy. — Above all, no one must be- 
lieve that we aim to drive into private schools the children 
of the well-to-do or those who desire “ book learning,” 
leaving the public school for those who must learn trades. 
To do this would create those permanent class dis- 
tinctions that would spell the death of democracy. 
And this is undoubtedly the goal to which some of the 
extreme advocates of industrial education would drive 
us. 
Arguments not wholly Convincing. — Frankly, it must 
be said that the most urgent advocates of extensive in- 
dustrial training as a coérdinate branch of the common 
school curriculum have not made out as yet a completely 
convincing case. The assumptions are stronger than the 
proof. Indeed, thus far the plea rests almost wholly 
upon assumption. The latest official report upon the 
subject is a very able, careful, and on the whole con- 
servative, document. I refer to the report for the year 
1908 of the New York Department of Labor, prepared 
by Director Charles H. Richards, of Cooper Union. 
This shows that in a very large minority of the industries 
studied, there is difficulty in obtaining skilled labor, and 
that in the opinions of many, still a minority, courses of 
industrial training would help to remove this difficulty. 
This does not seem to be a very strong argument for 
making such courses a codrdinate part of the work of the 
common schools, especially in view of other considera- 
tions naturally not included in the reports, but essential 
to a solution of the problem. 
A recent national convention on industrial training
-P-A-G-E-258
  
252 What Children Study and Why 
was practically a manufacturers’ convention. With very 
slight exceptions the sole question discussed was the 
supply of skilled labor to the factories and shops. The 
question of the education of youth seemed scarcely to 
have occurred to the speakers. 
The truths that there are more important things 
in life than skill in handicraft, that a skilled workman 
is not necessarily a good citizen, that the broadening 
and enriching of the mind is in itself so to be desired 
that official interference with it in the interest of 
mere manual efficiency would be deplorable, seem 
to have been overlooked. The speakers seemed to 
have considered but one side of the question. It is in- 
teresting that the chief advocate of liberal training for 
the pupils of the schools as contrasted with teaching 
trades was the representative of organized labor. He 
and those he represents are justly afraid of the enslaving 
effect of pushing children into trade guilds early, thus 
fixing permanently their social status. 
All this means that there are two sides to the question. 
The efficiency to be obtained through careful training 
in one’s chosen occupation is of course desirable. But 
to press this so far as to sacrifice breadth of mind and 
general intelligence would be disastrous. The man must 
always be larger than the workman. Some of the ques- 
tions yet to be answered are the following : 
How great, really, is the need of skilled labor beyond 
the present supply? Are the ranks of unskilled labor 
filled to any considerable degree with American boys and 
girls who would be in the ranks of the skilled if the com- 
mon schools taught trades? Are clerical positions and 
those of salesmen and others, requiring sense and in-
-P-A-G-E-259
Industrial Training 253 
telligence but not manual skill, overcrowded with boys 
and girls who would be better off as skilled manual 
laborers ? 
Is it possible to introduce trades into our schools with- 
out sacrificing other subjects? If not, what must go? 
Can it be shown that, in the long run, considering the 
pupils as future men and women and citizens, the stu- 
dents will be compensated for the loss of these studies 
by the knowledge of a trade? Just what is the place of 
the trade school in our system, as to the age of pupils, the 
length of the course, and the character of the instruc- 
tion? What trades and how many should be offered ? 
What is to be done for the girls? 
I cannot of course assume to answer these questions. 
I am a mere layman, a somewhat old-fashioned teacher. 
But I shall venture a few suggestions. 
The Proper Place. — What, then, is the proper place 
of industrial training in our public school system? At 
most it is that of an adjunct. Not one iota of the study 
of literature or history, or the fine arts, or any other 
purely cultural subject, must be sacrificed for it. To a_ 
certain extent it may be correlated with these studies, 
furnishing new activities, illustrations, and means of self- 
expression. Thus used, it may give point and direction 
to studies which before were somewhat vague and point- 
less. This is manifestly true of manual training. It is 
also true of nature study, mathematics, and history, 
and to a considerable degree of language study. 
Suppose a boy is looking forward to the carpenter’s 
trade; it is evident at once that his manual training ex- 
ercises acquire a new meaning, his work with tools has 
a new and very potent motive. His nature study also, 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  254 What Children Study and Why 
while being no less cultural, acquires a new interest. 
The more he can learn about the woods and metals that 
enter into the work of a carpenter, the better his equip- 
ment for his future trade. Even his history, if properly 
studied as to its industrial phases, throws light both upon 
his work, and, especially, upon the social and economic 
life of the carpenter. Then, abundant material for 
language expression is to be found in descriptions of the 
tools and materials used by the carpenter, in exact ac- 
counts of processes, and in descriptions of articles made. 
This is incidental indeed, but it shows how the study of 
a trade may be given a cultural value. 
But it cannot be repeated too often that the trade 
school proper must be an adjunct to the public school 
for general education, not a substitute for it or for any 
part of it. If trades are to be taught to pupils still in 
the common schools, it must be in additional classes, in 
the evenings, on Saturdays, or during the long vacations. 
Continuation School. — But the ideal trade school is 
the “ continuation school ” for boys and girls who have 
fulfilled the legal requirements as to school attendance, 
and desire or are compelled to learn a trade. Such 
schools should be of two sorts; those employing the full 
time of the students who are able to postpone gainful 
work until they have first learned their chosen trades, 
and schools employing a part of the time of those already 
working for wages in shops. 
The Full Time Schools.— The former require only 
the action of boards of education. They should, 
however, be not merely schools for teaching the details 
of trade, but should be as broadly cultural as possible. 
The cultural studies should be chosen because of their
-P-A-G-E-261
Industrial Training 255 
manifest relations to the trade taught, and should be 
grouped around it as a center. They should shed all 
possible light upon its higher phases, and especially 
upon its social bearings; for example, nature study 
should be the study of those natural objects that enter 
directly or indirectly into the work of the craft, — their 
qualities, origin, production, and uses. The history 
should be largely centered about industrial and economic 
conditions. 
The study of these subjects differs from the study of 
the same subjects for their cultural value in that it is 
the incident, while the trade itself is the ever evident 
aim. But it is none the less important and valuable. 
The pupils themselves should be led to see that such 
study will insure them higher success in their chosen 
work, that it will give them a wider outlook upon the 
conditions essential to the highest attainments, that it 
will make them more intelligent, larger, and wiser men 
and women, and hence better and more efficient carpen- 
ters, or blacksmiths, or cooks, or milliners. 
The range of activities of a trade school should be as 
wide as possible. As many trades should be taught 
as can be taught effectively. Otherwise there will be 
danger of unhappy economic disturbances due to the 
overcrowding of certain fields of work. The tendency 
seems to be to limit the work offered to a few trades. 
This will have to be corrected, or we shall have a large 
army of the unemployed in certain lines, and a consequent 
shortage in others. 
Avoid the Guild Notion. — But above all, every effort 
must be put forth to avoid the guild notion, for there is 
very real danger that trade schools, if generally organized
-P-A-G-E-262
  256 What Children Study and Why 
and largely attended, will have a tendency to increase the 
social differences of our citizens, and to fix them, produc- 
ing permanent classes and castes. 
One remedy for this is to intensify the cultural work 
of the trade schools. The larger the man or woman, the 
broader the outlook, the wider the sweep of purely in- 
tellectual attainments among manual workers, the less 
the danger of caste and social fixity. The great safe- 
guard of a democracy is the social fluidity of its citizen- 
ship. The easy transition from one phase of life to 
another, the widest variation of occupation among mem- 
bers of the same families, particularly the choice of work 
by the children different from that pursued by the parent, 
save a nation from the prejudices which are the basis 
of all caste and class distinctions. This the demo- 
cratic trade school must accentuate and develop to the 
fullest degree possible. 
In this respect the problem before America is quite 
different from that in most European countries. Hence 
we must be careful in borrowing ideas from Germany, 
for example, where not only are permanent class dis- 
tinctions prevalent, but where they are considered desir- 
able by the ruling powers, and where their perpetuation 
is a distinct aim in public education. 
Another caution that we must keep in mind is to avoid 
such training as will permanently limit the pupils’ powers 
of expansion. They must be saved from the narrowing 
effect of doing one small thing day after day. 
In this respect the trade school should have a distinct 
advantage over the apprentice system of learning trades. 
For the good trade schools teach all phases of a trade, 
and not merely a single one, while the tendency of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  Industrial Training ~ 257 
employer is to keep the employee engaged upon a single 
operation easily learned. This makes men small, though 
perhaps very expert in the narrow range of activity open 
to them. 
The Part Time School. — But not all boys and girls 
who are ready to choose a trade can stay in school long 
enough to learn one. Economic conditions compel 
them to go to work to earn money. Are these un- 
fortunates to be compelled to forego all training for 
their chosen work except the narrow round of a single 
movement given in the shop by the employer eager to 
turn the young brain and hand into ready money ? 
For these youths special schools should be provided, 
giving them, for an hour or more a day, high-grade 
broad technical instruction in their chosen crafts, and 
these should be daylight schools, not evening schools, 
and employers of boys and girls of limited education 
should be compelled not only to grant the necessary 
time, but to see to it that their employees of suitable 
age go to these schools. 
Some of the more enlightened manufacturers of the 
country maintain such schools at their own expense, 
notably the General Electric Company, under the 
now famous leadership of Mr. Alexander at Lynn, Mass. 
They find that the gain in power, in better compre- 
hension of the principles underlying the craft, and hence 
the better work done, more than compensate for the 
cost of the school. 
But this is properly the work of the public, quite as 
much as maintaining schools for the more fortunate 
youth who can give their entire time to education. 
Moreover, the single hour a day would do wonders,
-P-A-G-E-264
    
258 What Children Study and Why 
because every problem would have a meaning, and its 
solution would be applied immediately to the work of 
the shop. Besides, it would affect the social life of the 
pupils only for the better. As they would have made 
their choice of work already, the schools would qualify 
them for the higher ranks in this work. 
Training Farmers. — There is one phase of industrial 
training that is receiving much attention at the present 
time, which needs special consideration; that is train- 
ing for farming. The importance of such training 
cannot be questioned. It has two motives, — to keep 
the boys and girls on the farms, and to secure better 
farming than is commonly found in this country. It is 
hoped, by showing the independence and the many other 
advantages of country life, to stem the tide of country 
youth toward the cities, and also to educate those who 
are to be farmers to a more scientific and profitable 
cultivation of the land. 
To this end, in many states, instruction in the rural 
schools in the principles of agriculture is required by 
law. Also in some states township and county farm 
schools have been established, and elaborate colleges for 
teaching scientific farming have been appended to the 
state universities or created into separate institutions. 
Rural Schools.— The farm schools and the agri- 
cultural colleges are undoubtedly admirable in purpose, 
and very useful. Teaching farming in the country dis- 
trict schools is of more doubtful value. The teachers 
in most of these schools are very young women. It is 
to be feared that the instruction given by them to

  Industrial Training 259 
Proper Limitations. —- Might it not be better to con- 
fine the work in the common rural schools to reading 
matter showing the charms of rural life, and the com- 
parative independence of the farmer, and to nature study 
bearing especially upon farming, perhaps utilizing the 
school gardens, and by these means to persuade the boys 
and girls to attend agricultural schools? Is it not as true 
of training for farming as for the other industries that 
the trade school should be a continuation school, and that 
the elementary school should be devoted to giving a 
general education, with only such incidental reference 
to industries as will tend to create taste and enable the 
pupils to discover their aptitudes ? 
Industrial training seems destined to become a part 
of our public educational system. On the whole, it is 
to be regarded as desirable, but like all innovations it is 
in danger from its friends, and needs caution and wisdom 
to keep it in its proper place.

Tue Fine Arts 
SINGING 
Are not the fine arts too fine for the common schools ? 
Do they not belong to that army of fads that have been 
so vigorously and wittily and frequently denounced as 
corrupting our youth, turning the course of education 
into useless channels where it can turn no mill wheels 
of arithmetic or grammar? 
Value of Fads.—- Yes, truly they are fads; to the 
“practical ” materialist, anathema, to all the Gradgrinds, 
maranatha. But how about the boy and girl who are 
to be the dominating forces in the free nation of the 
morrow? One is almost tempted to paraphrase and 
say, “Let me teach the fads to the rising generation 
and I care not who teaches them the ‘ essentials.’” 
Let us remember that boys and girls in school are just 
people, not unlike those out of school. “ If you prick 
us, do we not bleed?” They stand in the same need of 
ideals, of cultivated feelings, of illumination and in- 
spiration, as their elders; and more, for they are more 
sensitive to influences, more easily turned toward ma- 
terialism or idealism. 
The fine arts are among the chief means of combating 
the much-preached-against tendency to low material 
aims, They are the principal reliance of the wise teacher 
260
-P-A-G-E-267
  The Fine Arts 261 
in training the feelings, cultivating that neglected area 
of the mind. 
The feelings are the key to character, furnishing the 
solvent for the hard intellectuality of mere learning, and 
supplying the motive to the will. “ Keep thine heart 
(feeling) with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of 
Nites 
If good character, showing itself in self-control for 
good ends and in a wise altruism, is the chief end of 
education, the feelings must be trained. Knowledge of 
good and evil is not enough. Adam and Eve acquired 
that through sinning—a marvelous parable. It is 
necessary to add to knowledge taste, a love for the good, 
the true, and the beautiful. No effort is wasted that 
brings into the lives of boys and girls a desire to taste 
the joys that come from the appreciative contemplation 
of this trinity of emotional appeal. Therefore let us 
have in the schools all the fads that may lift the eyes 
of the children “to the hills from whence cometh our 
help,” even if arithmetic and formal grammar must move 
up a bit to make room for them. 
Functions of Fine Arts. —The function of the fine 
arts in school is to open the minds of children to the 
higher meanings of life, to spread before them a feast 
of beauty and of joy that will keep their senses from 
noting with pleasure the vulgar, the coarse, the selfish, 
the evil of any sort, and will stimulate them to strive 
for attainment in the world of worthy ideals. 
The fine arts that have found a place in our schools 
are literature, music, drawing, and painting; to a very 
limited degree, modeling and the finer aspects of the 
constructive crafts. Happily they have gained such 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
Rts ae ea ee 
  262 What Children Study and Why 
a foothold that we may safely assert that they have 
come to stay. Of these arts the one which, with the 
possible exception of literature, makes the widest ap- 
peal, is music. It would be supererogatory to descant 
on the influence of music in general. But its function 
in school and how that is to be fulfilled need discussion. 
Two Aspects. — The two aspects of music that belong 
to education are producing music and appreciating 
music produced by others. Thus far in schools we 
have limited our efforts almost wholly to the former. 
We have undertaken to teach children to sing, it must 
be confessed with somewhat meager success. What may 
be accomplished in the other phase of music remains to 
be seen. 
School not a Studio.— The very modest success of 
our efforts to teach children in school to sing must be 
attributed mainly to faulty method, itself due to a 
failure to grasp the difference between the schoolroom 
and the studio. Until quite recently the methods were 
wholly those of the music studio, and these methods 
still prevail to a very large extent. 
In the studio a specially trained teacher of music 
teaches specially gifted pupils an art in which they al- 
ready have particular interest. These pupils are willing 
to undergo the drudgery of thorough training in the ele- 
ments of musical science, for ability to sing well is already 
a desideratum to them. Presumably they are already 
musical. They know something of music and they love 
it. Moreover, here, teaching music is the one aim, un- 
embarrassed by other claims upon the time and attention. 
Even if there is any lack of interest on the part of the 
pupils, the zeal of the teacher and his cultivated skill
-P-A-G-E-269
  The Fine Arts 263 
in teaching this particular art, to a very considerable 
degree, atone for this lack. 
In the school the conditions are quite different. The 
teachers for the most part are untrained in this art, and 
few of them are in any true sense musical. They are 
compelled merely to follow the instruction of the super- 
visor, or the course of study, without much interest, and 
frequently without skill. Many of them are much more 
interested in arithmetic or grammar than in music. 
The children too are of all sorts, children with no in- 
terest in music, those with a little interest, and those 
with great interest, all in one class to be taught together. 
They do not come to school to study music chiefly, or 
even as a very important matter. They would find no 
fault if not taught it at all. Some have considerable 
musical ability, some little, some are monotones. Under 
these conditions, De Reszke with Farrar as a pupil will 
not serve as a model. The approach must be psycho- 
logical, rather than scientific. The limitations of the 
teacher, of the pupils, and of the curriculum, all re- 
quire this. 
Wherein have the prevailing methods been faulty? 
In two respects in particular, and these relate to the two 
especial aims in the teaching of music in school. 
Appeal to Aisthetic Nature.— In order to realize 
through the teaching of singing the higher ends of 
education to which they are supposed to contribute, it 
is necessary, through a wholesome cultivation of the 
feelings, that children should come to love singing, 
to love music, and to know and love good music. The 
appeal should be made from the very first to the 
esthetic nature. Hence the beginning should be song,
-P-A-G-E-270
¥ , 
264 What Children Study and Why 
real song, such as the children can appreciate, but not: 
vulgar or commonplace. The rhythm, the melody, the 
lilt, the echo of the heart beat, which are the physical 
basis of both poetry and music, should be strongly present 
in the first musical instruction, and they should never 
disappear. The mechanics of music, its scientific struc- 
ture, should be kept in the background and should be 
brought forward only when the children are ready for 
it as explanation of that which already has given them 
pleasure and as a means to fuller joy in singing. 
The familiar method of teaching singing to children 
by beginning with the scale is comparable to teaching 
reading by beginning with the alphabet or teaching draw- 
ing by beginning with a study of type forms, the sphere, 
the cube, and the cylinder, methods which all the older 
teachers will readily recall. To a degree they are all 
logical. They start with principles, and what method 
of teaching a principle is so simple as to state it “in 
good set terms”? But they are to even a greater degree 
unpsychological. They ignore the interest of the 
learner. They forget that children learn by contact 
with things, embodied principles, first, and later may 
come to understand and even to state the principles. 
Begin with Songs.— Hence teaching singing in 
schools must begin with singing, singing real songs, 
enjoyable to the children in both sense and rhythm, 
appealing even to the unmusical children. It must 
first be rote singing, singing “ by ear,’’ until the songs 
are learned. Gradually a study of principles and even 
of technic may be introduced, after the children have 
been made ready by much enjoyable singing. 
It is not the aim of this discussion to treat of method
-P-A-G-E-271
The Fine Arts 265 
in detail, but to indicate the principles on which all method 
must be based, if children are really to learn to sing. 
It must be remembered that teaching singing in school 
is not merely or chiefly to give children a knowledge of 
the principles of the art. It is rather to introduce into 
the school life, and thence into the after life, a new element 
of joy. This involves cultivating not only a love for 
music, but a love for good music, appreciation, musical 
taste. This is the principal reason why the music used 
in instruction should be good music. Mere exercises, 
musical phrases composed to illustrate some principle of 
technic, will not do. 
It is as great a sin to keep children, in the earlier period 
of learning to sing, drilling on meaningless mechanical 
phrases and scales, as it is to make the early reading les- 
sons of meaningless combinations of letters or of words. 
The “do re me do”? first lessons in singing are on the 
same plane with the “ See the ox go up ”’ first lessons in 
reading, or those even worse, in which sounds are put 
before sense. 
In the one, as in the other, the emphasis should be 
upon the content from the very start. The cultivation 
of taste should move with equal step with learning the 
principles of the art. The earliest music used should 
appeal to the feelings, both for the joy it yields in the 
present, and for the fuller joy it may be expected to 
yield with growing taste. Music enriches chiefly the 
esthetic side of life. Hence to the esthetic nature it 
should appeal during the process of learning. 
Moreover, the pupil should learn through his music 
lesson to appreciate the music of others. But this will 
be treated in a later chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  CHAPTER XXV 
Tue Prastic AND GRAPHIC ARTS 
THE same principles that apply to singing apply with 
equal force to drawing and painting and modeling. 
There are the same limitations of environment, of un- 
trained or meagerly trained teachers, of pupils without 
previous preparation, without taste, without desire. 
As with singing, the methods must be adapted to these 
conditions. The first efforts must be to represent truth- 
» fully real things which the children desire to represent. 
They must see from the first that they are getting posses- 
sion of a new language, through which they may express 
the results of their observations and their feelings. 
Create Appreciation.— Furthermore the lessons in 
drawing and painting and modeling must open their 
eyes to the meanings and the beauties of what others 
have done with these arts. The child who has not 
learned through his drawing lessons to enjoy the fine 
drawing of a great artist has missed one of the chief 
possible values of his lesson. 
To this end good models of drawings of subjects 
similar to those he is to draw should be presented to 
the children. Iam aware that this is heretical. We 
are told continually that the child must see for himself. 
Of course he must. But he must learn to see wi‘h the 
eyes of the artist, to distinguish the essential from the 
266
-P-A-G-E-273
The Plastic and Graphic Arts 267 
unessential, and in particular to see the beauty of what 
he is trying to represent. Studying the work of a real 
artist will open the eyes of the student so that he can 
see more for himself. 
Value of Copying. — There is much to be said for the 
old custom of requiring students of drawing and paint- 
ing to copy the works of masters. I am aware that a 
suggestion of copying in school would meet with ex- 
treme disfavor in the eyes of drawing teachers and 
supervisors. Still I am rash enough to suggest it as 
a very valuable exercise. The great masters of English 
have generally acquired facility and style through copy- 
ing the styles of admired masters. Stevenson, for exam- 
ple, confesses himself a copyist in his earlier attempts, 
changing his master repeatedly. The great painters 
have all either begun in that way or have supple- 
mented their earlier attempts at self-expression by sed- 
ulous copying. How else is a style to be acquired? 
A student who carefully copies the works of a master 
learns to see as the master saw, and thus has his eyes 
opened to beauties before concealed. I am convinced 
that it would be an excellent exercise to introduce into 
the elementary drawing lessons as well as into those 
more advanced. 
Copying Not All.— Of course, this is by no means 
the whole story. Constant copying would weaken origi- 
nality. The pupil must learn to see with his own eyes 
the beauties of what he is to draw, and to select the 
salient features and group his objects so as to bring out 
these features. Therefore, after the close study, line 
by line, of some master’s drawing or painting, such as 
is required for copying, he should attempt to draw simi-
-P-A-G-E-274
  268 What Children Study and Why 
lar objects and groups of objects, using what he has 
learned in his copying. 
Drawing a Language. — The drawing lesson has an- 
other function also. It should not only feed the esthetic 
nature of the child, but it also should give him a new 
language, a fresh medium through which he may express 
his thoughts. This he will acquire mainly through use, 
but also through studying the successful attempts of 
others to express their thoughts. 
The young child begins crudely to represent what he 
sees, and these crude drawings are often very interesting. 
But the interest is mainly psychological rather than ar- 
tistic. Through these untutored efforts we get insight 
into the workings of a child’s mind. But if this kind of 
drawing is continued too long, there results retardation 
and a clogging of the mental machinery, — arrested de- 
velopment,—and here is where the child’s drawing often 
breaks down. His work in the intermediate grades loses 
the freedom that it had in the primary school. He be- 
comes self-conscious, ashamed of the crudity of his efforts, 
and, lacking the help that an elementary knowledge of 
technic would give him, loses his interest in drawing. 
Correct graphic expression can no more be evolved from 
his inner consciousness than correct language or music. 
Before he can use the art effectively, he must know some- 
thing of its laws. These he should be led to discover in 
the work of one who has obeyed them. In other words, 
freedom may be carried so far as to destroy itself. There. 
is first the freedom of infancy, untrammeled by any 
limitations except those of the child’s own power. But 
very soon this must be succeeded by the freedom of law, 
the conscious power of one who knows how.
-P-A-G-E-275
  The Plastic and Graphic Arts 269 
It must not be forgotten that the great aim of teaching 
any of the fine arts is to develop power to see and to 
reproduce beauty, and to this end it is necessary to 
understand, to a limited extent at least, the laws of 
beauty. 
Too much of the drawing in schools is barren and me- 
chanical, resulting either in a vain self-satisfaction or 
in a lack of interest. 
Begin with Pictures.— The principles suggested for 
the teaching of music apply with equal force to drawing. 
As the former should begin with music, so this should 
begin with pictures, many pictures, good pictures. Nat- 
urally these pictures should be of a sort interesting to 
children. If possible they should be in color. It is 
much more important to have in a primary school a 
stock of good pictures than a set of drawing books or 
of type-form models. Photographs, copies in black and 
white and in sepia tints, and reproductions well done in 
color, are easily obtained and inexpensive. Among 
the best of the various classes of pictures available 
for schoolroom use are the large colored posters now 
offered by all school art dealers. 
Must fit Children.—It is most important that the 
pictures used be of subjects adapted to children. Much 
good art, especially classic art, fails to excite interest 
in children. Well-meaning committees often err in this 
regard. Even classical madonnas generally do not ap- 
peal to children. Pictures of animals, of other children, 
of domestic scenes, preferably modern, are the most 
suitable for use in primary schools. Large pictures 
with only a few details are the best. These should be 
changed from time to time and should be studied, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  270 What Children Study and Why 
is, carefully observed, and the interesting features and 
such of the points of beauty as children can appreciate 
should be talked about. All this is preparing for the 
more technical study later. It is creating taste. It is 
the natural way of approaching the subject. 
Much Drawing. — Along with this, of course, should 
be much drawing and painting by the children. At first 
this will be necessarily of the crude, psychological sort. 
But quite early a few principles may be taught by ob- 
servation. Color work is best, — at first, — with large, 
generous effects, concealing the unsteadiness of little 
hands, and requiring chiefly arm movements. The sky 
line and a little of perspective may be easily taught. 
The children’s observations, at first undirected, be- 
come gradually more definite. Their reproductions grow 
accurate, truthful, and artistic through a gradual ac- 
quaintance with some of the essential laws of the art, 
obtained by studying pictures with constantly increas- 
ing closeness, and by drawing and painting what they 
themselves see.
-P-A-G-E-277
CHAPTER XXVI 
THe DEVELOPMENT OF TASTE 
How is it possible in the ordinary public school to 
inculcate taste in the fine arts? As to literature, the 
question is a simple one, and has been sufficiently an- 
swered in the chapters on Reading and Nature Study. 
But how is it with music and the graphic and plastic arts? 
The natural way of cultivating a taste for good music 
is to enable the learner to hear good music sung or pro- 
duced by orchestras, or by performers upon single in- 
struments. It is evident that it is possible only in rare 
instances to present in schools for the benefit of pupils 
either skilled singers or trained performers upon musical 
instruments, either single or in bands. Now and then 
in the larger cities in a very few cases this may be done, 
but these cases are so exceptional as to be negligible in 
any general consideration of the musical needs of chil- 
dren. Public concerts in parks sometimes offer real 
training in musical taste, and fortunately the custom 
of giving such concerts is growing. But the schools have 
no control over these offerings, and can have none. 
Moreover, they reach a comparatively small number. 
Can the schools do anything for the many children 
attending them? 
Canned Music.— There seems to be but one way 
at present, and that is through the increased use of 
271 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
272 What Children Study and Why 
“canned music.” Phonographs and mechanical piano 
players have already attained a considerable popularity 
in schools, and it is to be hoped their use may be 
greatly extended. These instruments of various sorts 
have been so greatly improved that they really offer 
very excellent substitutes for the personal performer. 
In many cases they present good music in a very much 
better style than the best local talent, even if this could 
be secured. If every school owned a first-class phono- 
graph, or a good piano-player, or both, children could 
hear enough good music really to develop musical taste. 
In some instances, school boards are wise enough to 
provide such instruments, but in most cases, where they 
have been obtained for schools, it has been done through 
the efforts of teachers and pupils, aided occasionally by 
parents’ clubs and other auxiliary organizations. It is 
an excellent thing to work for. 
Good Music to Sing. — Aside from this device, al- 
most the only reliance of those who would elevate the 
people’s children through the aid of music is in the kind 
of music presented for their singing exercises. As was 
said in the preceding chapter, this should always be 
good music. Mere exercises, scales, runs, and all pseudo- 
music, should take a subordinate place, merely to train 
the ear and the voice and to give the ability to read 
music, after the children, through singing real music, 
have acquired some taste and a desire to know more of 
the art which already gives them pleasure. They should 
never precede such pleasurable singing, and should never 
supersede it. They should merely accompany it when 
necessary, in order to make it more pleasurable. 
The “music books”’ filled with “‘made up” strains of
-P-A-G-E-279
    
The Development of ‘Taste 273 
inferior grade, so common in our schools, should go to 
the scrap heap, and in their place should be books con- 
taining music, real music. For we must never forget 
that the real aim of teaching music in schools is the ele- 
vation of the feelings and the consequent enrichment of 
the moral nature, and the one essential to this end is 
music itself, fine music, in abundance, developing taste 
and an unquenchable appetite for more music. 
As to drawing and painting and modeling, the situa- 
tion is much more encouraging, or rather the facilities 
for cultivating taste are much more easily obtained. 
Reproductions of good paintings and drawings and 
statues are abundant and inexpensive. A very small 
sum of money will equip a school with a portfolio of 
thoroughly satisfactory reproductions of the best of 
the world’s paintings, and with a few plaster casts, for 
all instructional purposes as good as the originals. It 
should be the aim of every school to own such a treasury. 
It is not enough to have a few good pictures hanging 
on the walls, though of course these should be present. 
There should also be the portfolio. And all these pic- 
tures should be studied sympathetically, not merely to 
get a story from them for the language lesson, but to find 
out why they are beautiful. This study should be a 
regular and necessary part of the drawing lesson. In 
some cases it might profitably precede an attempt to 
draw some similar subject, but in most it should be 
simply a study to find the beauty — a training in taste. 
Feed the Soul through the Eyes. — When a child has 
completed a common school course, it is not enough for 
him to.be able to draw simple objects fairly well. He 
should be able to tell a good picture from a bad one,
-P-A-G-E-280
274 What Children Study and Why 
and why it is better, and he should love the good picture 
and despise the bad one. The Sunday comic supple- 
ment should excite his horror and detestation, as should 
some of the illustrations that do not illustrate, found 
in popular novels and magazines. 
We do not pay enough attention to the feeding of 
children’s souls through the eyes. We cannot wholly 
prevent the presentation to them of the base, the com- 
monplace, the vulgar, even the indecent, in books and 
papers, and on public walls. But we might to a degree 
at least render them immune to these degrading sights 
by cultivating a distaste for bad art, through its antipode, 
a love for good art. Here is where stress should be laid 
in the art departments of our schools. 
It is possible, if the schools should seriously undertake 
to cultivate taste in the children, that, in time, our civili- 
zation would be so far removed from barbarism that 
popular sentiment would demand the entire abolishment 
of bill boards. But that may be an iridescent dream.  
-P-A-G-E-281
  CHAPTER XXVII 
THE CoRRELATION OF STUDIES 
Tuus far we have discussed the values of the different 
subjects of the school curriculum considered separately, 
and have endeavored to intimate distinctly some ways 
by which these values might be secured to the students. 
But this is by no means the whole story of education 
through study. In a higher sense no subject can be 
considered independently. 
The Mind One. — The mind is one. It does not 
consist even of separate “faculties,” as taught in the 
older psychology. These so-called faculties are but vari- 
ous activities of the mind. Even memory is composite 
and contains elements of reason, of feeling, and even of 
willing. It cannot be cultivated at all without calling 
into service these elements. If this is true of the mind 
itself, it is especially true of the various means and ma- 
terials that are employed in education. 
Knowledge of Relation. — Nothing can be known 
alone. All knowledge is of relations. As the various 
foods are taken into the body and there cease to be meat, 
potatoes, bread, and become “ one body,’ essentially 
different from any one of them, so all knowledge is a 
fusion of many elements, which have lost to a consider- 
able degree their original characteristics. 
What we choose to call arithmetic, grammar, and read- 
275 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  276 What Children Study and Why 
ing, when used in education, are but foods of the mind, 
which lose their identity when absorbed, and become 
simply undistinguishable elements of mind stuff. The 
only knowledge, again, is correlated knowledge. How- 
ever diligently we may teach disparate subjects, when 
they become subjective knowledge, they have been by 
some mysterious process of mental alchemy fused into 
the mind itself, so that they are all present in the ac- 
tivities of any one. 
We talk of abstract number, which means merely 
number not applied to a particular object. But num- 
bering, a mental act, cannot be abstracted from reason, 
from memory, from symbolizing, from a hundred other 
mental actvities. The Hegelians have much to say of 
their categories, and do not recognize a truth until it is 
categoried. This is a rather technical and materialistic 
way of stating a fundamental truth. Knowledge does 
not exist, as such, until it has found its place among the 
previously possessed knowledges and has become a dis- 
tinct part of them, almost or quite unrecognizable under 
its own name. 
Knowledge Individual.— To put it, possibly, in a 
more plain and practical way, both the thing learned and 
the learning mind are modified by the act of learning. 
This is apperception. No two people can know exactly 
the same thing. The mind can know only what it is 
fitted to know by reason of its previous content and 
mode of action. Dr. Holmes wittily expresses this in 
_ the “ Autocrat of the Breakfast Table ” thus: “It is 
not easy, at the best, for two persons talking together 
to make the most of each other’s thoughts, there are 
so many of them. When John and Thomas, for in-
-P-A-G-E-283
  The Correlation of Studies RT. 
stance, are talking together, it is natural enough that 
among the six there should be more or less confusion 
and misapprehension. 
“As I said, I think I can make it plain to Benjamin 
Franklin here, that there are at least six personalities 
distinctly to be recognized as taking part in that dia- 
logue between John and Thomas. 
x. The real John; known only to his Maker. 
2. John’s ideal John; never the real one, and 
often very unlike him. 
Thomas’s ideal John; never the real John, 
nor John’s John, but often very unlike 
either. 
1. The real Thomas. 
THREE ‘i .{-.fASES.{2. Thomas’s ideal Thomas. 
3. John’s ideal Thomas. THREE JOHNS. 
“Only one of the three Johns is taxed ; only one can be 
weighed on a platform balance; but the other two are 
just as important in the conversation. Let us suppose 
the real John to be old, dull, and ill-looking. But as the 
Higher Powers have not conferred on men the gift of 
seeing themselves in the true light, John very possibly 
conceives himself to be youthful, witty, and fascinating, 
and talks from the point of view of this ideal. Thomas, 
again, believes him to be an artful rogue, we will say; 
therefore he is, so far as Thomas’s attitude in the con- 
versation is concerned, an artful rogue, though really 
simple and stupid. The same conditions apply to the 
three Thomases. It follows that, until a man can be 
found who knows himself as his Maker knows him, or 
who sees himself as others see him, there must be at 
least six persons engaged in every dialogue between two.
-P-A-G-E-284
  278 What Children Study and Why 
Of these, the least important, philosophically speaking, 
is the one that we have called the real person. No won- 
der two disputants often get angry, when there are six 
of them talking and listening all at the same time.” 
To a child riding on a locomotive with his father, a red 
light is only a red light, while to the father it is a signal 
of danger or even of death. 
To Wordsworth’s Matthew, 
‘(A primrose by the river’s brim, 
A simple primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more.” 
While to the poet himself, 
“The meanest flower that grows can give 
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.” 
In more practical fields, — A general term such as a 
trapezoid to the mathematician brings at once a perfect 
image of the geometric figure, while to a child in a pri- 
mary school, studying an old-fashioned arithmetic, it 
means — nothing. 
Topics Composite. —- The various topics named in a 
course of study are all composite. No one represents 
a single line of mental activity, or a single exactly segre- 
gated body of knowledge. Each is merely a convenient 
conventional grouping of more or less closely related 
bodies of facts. Some subjects, such as geography, are 
confessedly agglomerations of many sciences, very loosely 
coérdinated. Others, as arithmetic, are assemblages of 
knowledge associated by a single common factor, as 
number, — like buttons on a string. A few, like spelling, 
represent more nearly a single field, but a very narrow
-P-A-G-E-285
  The Correlation of Studies 279 
one. History and the fine arts stand for a more sub- 
stantial, because a more philosophical, unity. But to 
treat any topic of the curriculum as if it stood alone in 
the field of facts as a plainly distinct entity, is to per- 
vert the truth and to place obstacles in the way of the 
natural correlation which goes on in the mind whenever 
anything is learned. 
The Practical Aspect. — The practical aspect of these 
truths to the teacher is this: Since all facts learned must 
be fused in the mind with other facts known, that is, 
with the mind itself, it behooves the teacher to present 
them to pupils so that they may be fused readily. There 
is enormous waste in the ordinary way of teaching sub- 
jects without special regard to their relations. Text- 
books too frequently have an eye single to the topic 
named in the title, and endeavor to separate it from 
all other topics however naturally related, and to treat 
it as an abstract, unrelated entity, so that the child and 
even the teacher have little notion of the essential one- 
ness of the curriculum. 
It is true that in the intensive study appropriate for 
university specialists such abstraction is desirable and 
even necessary. The subject being already well known 
in its larger aspects and in its broad relations, becomes 
the proper subject for minute investigation as to its own 
essential qualities. But the children in elementary 
schools have no such general knowledge. Even the 
simplest relations have yet to be made plain to them. 
They are quite too willing to treat learning as a task for 
the memory. So they learn the rule and the definition 
and the isolated fact, in order that they may recite them 
glibly to the teacher, with never a dream that they con-
-P-A-G-E-286
280 What Children Study and Why 
ceal vital truths which would help to explain the in- 
finite complexity of environing life. 
Unless arithmetic makes clear to some degree the 
numerical and dimensional characteristics of the world, 
the time devoted to it is largely wasted. It would be 
wholly so, if it were not for the truth that the mind it- 
self, in spite of the textbook and the teacher, does a 
vast amount of codrdinating and finds meanings in state- 
ments in themselves meaningless, as set forth in the 
lesson. 
The language lesson is too often the study of rules 
and forms arbitrarily given, which have no more effect 
upon the speech of the child than the wind that blows. 
This is particularly true of those elementary language 
lessons that feed the children desiccated grammar, the 
husks and chaff of language. 
Geography perhaps more commonly than any other 
school topic to the children is a meaningless and lifeless 
study, “ the study of dots and lines on colored pieces of 
paper,” as Colonel Parker used to call it. 
Though of late years much more has been done to 
vitalize teaching and learning, still our schools are very 
far from making knowledge real to the children by placing 
it in its proper and natural relations, and thus rendering 
the process of fusion easy. 
It is no uncommon thing for children to be studying 
the history of England, the geography of Africa, the 
natural phenomena of Minnesota, all on the same day, 
while at the same time memorizing the rules of grammar 
applied to nothing, and talking ungrammatically of the 
subjects named, and learning to write “ Honesty is the 
best policy,” and to spell hautboy, pneumatics, and in-
-P-A-G-E-287
  
The Correlation of Studies 281 
compatibility, the last-named word having indeed a 
general application to the various ingredients of the 
educational hodgepodge. While in its absurdity this 
picture may be extreme, a glance at almost any course 
of study will discover fairly close approximations to it. 
Waste. — Perhaps the worst feature of the prevailing 
plan is its awful waste of time and energy. The cry 
that we try to teach too many things in school is certainly 
true if they are taught as so many irreconcilable lists of 
things to be “ stored away ” in the mind. 
The Remedy.— The remedy for the overcrowded 
curriculum is to be sought, at least partially, in a closer 
coérdination of the now heterogeneous topics. History 
and geography need to be joined in wedlock. Nature 
study should be adopted into the family. Language 
should be taught as one means of expressing ideas on 
the other subjects studied, drawing as another. Perhaps 
language study comes nearer to being a universal sol- 
vent than any other single topic, because of its manifest 
function as the universal means of expression. 
No Topic Dominant. — But no single topic can be 
made the center of a course of. study, for no one is 
dominant or naturally central. The various attempts 
of a few years back to “concentrate” the course of 
study about a single topic, or two or three topics, met 
with foredoomed failure, and brought the whole subject 
of the correlation of studies into disrepute. 
There is no mechanical device of arrangement that will 
meet all cases, because learning is a vital process; the 
necessary fusion goes on in and with the mind. The 
learning child is the necessary center of all correlation. 
About him and his individual needs and aptitudes the
-P-A-G-E-288
  oy What Children ‘Study and Why 
subjects must be grouped so that he may fuse them un- 
consciously, much as he digests his food. But still he 
may be greatly aided by a careful selection and arrange- 
ment of the topics in the course of study and especially 
in the daily program. 
It is for the officials who make the course of study and 
for the teachers who administer it to watch continually 
for points of contact, to illumine each topic presented by 
reference to allied topics, to see, in short, that truths, 
and not mere isolated facts, are presented as food to the 
growing minds of children. 
An Important Distinction.— One distinction is im- 
portant, and, if carefully observed, will do much toward 
making knowledge real, and consequently toward the pre- 
vention of scattering and the elimination of waste, — and 
that is the distinction between content and form, between 
fundamental vital knowledge and the various minor arts 
by which such knowledge is acquired and expressed. 
If language is always treated as the study of thought; 
if reading is always taught as a means of getting ideas; 
if arithmetic is always made to explain some important 
truth in the physical universe, or in the relations of man 
to man; if through these arts the children are given in- 
sight into physics, commerce, history, literature, human 
society, then the arts become worth while, and then also 
the distracting number of disparate topics in the school 
program will be found to dwindle naturally. 
The nearer we can approach in our teaching to a 
realization of the unity of knowledge, without running 
into artificial absurdities of correlation, the more time we 
shall find to “ teach the essentials,” and the essentials 
will then be truly essential, because they will be vital. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
CHAPTER XXVIII 
EFFICIENCY OF THE COURSE OF STUDY 
Nor only by correlation is it possible to make room 
for the many desirable subjects that, it is claimed, now 
overcrowd the course of study. Equally essential is 
higher efficiency of administration, through a better ad- 
justment of studies to the pupil’s mental status, and 
through the avoidance of useless repetition. This ques- 
tion has not been sufficiently discussed by students of 
education. 
Supposing the prevalent course of study in our ele- 
mentary schools to rest upon sound bases, psychological, 
social, and philosophical, the question remains: Is it 
efficient? Is it so adjusted to the psychological and 
social needs of the individual pupils as to render ade- 
quate returns for the efforts expended? 
This is too large a question to be discussed in a simple 
brief chapter. Indeed, it can be answered fully only by 
such a searching investigation as no one has yet under- 
taken. It is to be hoped that at some time such an 
examination will be undertaken either by one of the 
various endowed institutions of research, or better, by 
the United States Bureau of Education. 
A Source of Waste.—-I must, however, though briefly, 
call attention to one manifest and serious source of waste 
in the general administration of the course of study, to 
283 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
  284 What Children Study and Why 
which I have already referred, the prodigal waste of time 
through useless repetition. : 
Several subjects, whose function is chiefly informa- 
tional, are taken up in the primary schools in simple form 
and then repeated in the intermediate and grammar 
schools in somewhat fuller detail and in different 
language. In some cases even these modifications either 
are lacking or are very slight. Some subjects, such as 
reading and the correct use of language, are so naturally 
progressive that no such repetition is possible. But with 
the other subjects this is not the case. 
Geography. — Geography, for example, is usually 
taught from a “two-book series.” In the primary book 
information is given in more or less simple language 
about the earth as a whole, about geographic phenom- 
ena, such as day and night, the planetary system, the 
succession of months and of seasons; geographic forms, 
as hills, valleys, continents, oceans, plains, and the rest ; 
geographic causes, such as erosion, winds, glaciers; and 
about the political divisions of the earth as shown on 
maps. Beginning with about the fifth grade the higher 
book is taken, in which these facts are repeated in some- 
what different language and in greater detail, but with- 
out great difference or improvement. Much of the in- 
formation given in the primary book is of no great 
interest or value to the children pursuing it. The facts 
are memorized, — or not, as may be, — but not in any 
true sense comprehended. The subject is usually dis- 
liked, and hence a distaste for it is created which is sure 
to militate against the best results in the higher grades. 
There is no special reason why a child should attempt 
to learn or, still less, to comprehend the greater part of
-P-A-G-E-291
  Efficiency of the Course of Study 285 
the facts given in the ordinary primary geography at the 
time they are studied. The time and effort expended 
upon them are largely wasted or worse. They might 
much better be devoted to the direct study of environ- 
ment, such as nature and human industries, to manual 
training, and to other “ fads.” 
Geography is now commonly studied during five or six 
consecutive years, with no better results at the end than 
would follow two years’ study at the right time, when the 
minds of the children are mature enough to grasp its 
principles. 
A one-book geography, taken up say at the beginning 
of the sixth year, would find the students ready. They 
would have sufficient knowledge of manifest environing 
geographic conditions to stimulate curiosity, and maturity 
of mind enough to pursue the subject intelligently and 
swiftly. All the increment of power that comes with 
the development of the subject, with interest, and with 
ability to think consecutively, — the natural and proper 
results of a wise primary training, — would make it pos- 
sible to learn more in one or two years than is now 
learned in six. Any one who has listened to the parrot- 
like repetition by primary children of “ Montpelier on 
the Onion,” of ‘‘ The principal industries are manufac- 
turing, agriculture, grazing, and mining,’ must have 
been first amused and then saddened at the thought of 
the precious years frittered away. 
It is simply traditional that, geography being a useful 
study, its facts must be crammed into infant minds. 
If in its formal presentation it could be entirely cut out 
of our primary schools, think of the time and energy 
that would be set free for the really essential things, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
eas ee ih oes ne ad eg ar «(ts ar Ae a arse ga 
286 What Children Study and Why 
there would be, not loss, but actual gain, for geography 
itself. 
This does not mean that there should be no considera- 
tion in primary schools of any of the facts that enter 
into that assemblage of miscellanies called geography, 
but merely that there should be no formal textbook 
study of it, and that the study should be limited to such 
phenomena as come naturally within the observation 
of the children. It should be, in other words, nature 
study, and at first hand. Through “ nature study les- 
sons,” used, it may be, as subject matter for language 
lessons, enough knowledge could be obtained both to 
satisfy the present need and to provide the necessary 
apperception centers for the later serious study of the 
geography textbook. 
Beyond question much of the slow progress of children 
in primary schools, especially noticeable as contrasted 
with their rapid growth before coming to school, is due 
to the maladaptation to infant digestion of the pabulum 
offered. We are unwilling to wait for minds to grow, 
but must stuff them, as geese are stuffed to produce the 
diseased livers desired of epicures. 
Nor does geography stand alone in this indictment. 
Grammar is almost as great a sinner against childhood 
and its proper education. The grammar taught to in- 
fant minds, even if predigested in a pseudo “ language 
book,” is even more worthless to the children than the 
contents of a primary geography. It has nothing to do 
with their speech or with their writing of English at this 
stage. It is a mere intruder and time waster. If all 
the time devoted to it below the seventh grade, — I had 
almost said below the high school, — could be given to 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  Efficiency of the Course of Study 287 
securing habits of correct speech and to constructive 
English, including the gathering and assorting of material 
to write about, and if then the student could come to it, 
when mature enough, fresh and eager for the reasons for 
what he had learned to do, a single year would suffice 
to cover all the ground necessary for any intelligent 
man or woman, not professionally a scholar, or “lit- 
erary person.” 
The slow progress, the discouragement, the dislike, — 
almost universal as they are, — are due to the attempt 
to teach a metaphysical subject during the time when the 
child’s whole interest is in the material and social worlds. 
Knowledge of the metaphysical nature of a sentence is 
not an imperative demand of either the mind or society 
that needs to be thrust upon the infant in formule, 
whether understood or not. To teach it in the third 
grade and again in the eighth is not merely to waste 
the time of child and teacher, it tends to deaden the 
child’s mind, destroy his interest, and pervert his view 
of school. 
Arithmetic. — But possibly the greatest waste of time 
through useless repetition is in arithmetic, — Arith- 
metic! the ‘“ solid” American’s Bible, the foundation 
of our fortunes, our virtues, our civilization, without 
which we should have neither financier nor embezzler — 
can it be possible to have too much of it? Let us see. 
In most schools a textbook in Arithmetic is taken up 
in the third grade, — in some, even earlier. From that 
time it is pursued unremittingly, relentlessly, till the 
bitter end. Six continuous years at the least, and during 
all of that time it is the major subject. Does it pay? 
If children had no textbook in arithmetic before the
-P-A-G-E-294
  288 What Children Study and Why 
fifth year and then studied it, for no longer time each day 
than is now given to it, for two years, at the end of that 
time they would know as much of the subject as they do 
now at the end of the elementary school course. Neces- 
sarily a certain study of number would come into the 
school life in all its years as it does into the life outside 
of school, but the formal study of arithmetical princi- 
ples does not necessarily come into either life at this age. 
Every good kindergarten teaches number, every con- 
tact with the world teaches number. Counting, and 
making the simple additions and subtractions that life, 
in school and out, require, are acquired naturally and 
almost unconsciously. A young child has no use for 
elaborate notation or for large numbers. To try to 
teach him the reasons for “ carrying ”’ and “ borrowing ” 
in addition and subtraction is to dull his perception with 
words, and this is true in most cases even when simple 
and logical methods are employed. The only possible 
way of giving him even a glimmering of the truth is by 
some form of muscular effort such as is mentioned in 
Chapter XI of this book. But even that had better be 
deferred for several years, until the pupil is mentally 
ready for it and curious about it. 
If all the number work in the primary school were in- 
formal and incidental, — “not accidental”; that is, 
the grasping of the very few number facts that are needed 
to secure the child’s adjustment to his environment, 
not only would he actually know more arithmetic at the 
end of the primary school than he does now, but his 
further progress in the grammar school would be un- 
impeded by baleful memories of earlier discouragements 
and agonies.
-P-A-G-E-295
  Efficiency of the Course of Study 289 
It is not necessary to elaborate upon other subjects, 
One of the most popular physiology texts for elementary 
schools, a two-book series, repeats the greater part of the 
first book in the second, verbatim et literatim. Imagine 
the enthusiasm of a child coming upon the familiar 
matter in his grammar-school text. 
Books but Interpret Life. — Let us not forget that 
“ book-learning ” at best is but the interpretation of 
life, in words, and often isnot even that, but is a mere 
memorizing of words divorced from ideas; that a knowl- 
edge of life must therefore precede a study of books, 
and that the wider this knowledge the larger the value 
of the books; that children are first naturally inter- 
ested in the environing world; and we shall then begin 
to see the proper order of elementary studies. 
While Rousseau’s doctrine had many absurdities, it 
had also a foundation of truth. Nature, social and ma- 
terial, 7s the child’s first school. Let him attend it and 
get all he can from it. Let us reserve adult studies and 
adult processes for adult minds. Let us not force them 
upon infant minds even in predigested form, but let us 
give the little ones what they need, and thus prepare 
them for the more difficult problems which will be pre- 
sented in due time. 
If our course of study could be adjusted so that during 
the earlier years the children were occupied chiefly with 
activities, observations, and adjustments; acquiring a 
practical, though fragmentary, knowledge of the world 
and its arts; gaining power by exercise, physical, in- 
tellectual, moral ; learning to read and acquiring love for 
good reading, learning to use good English in oral and 
written speech, learning to think about things as they
-P-A-G-E-296
290 What Children Study and Why 
occur, learning to do things that should be done, learning 
to make useful articles, learning, in short, to live satis- 
factory children’s lives, and then, when a little older 
and more mature, could take up seriously the subjects 
that must be studied from books, —if this revolution 
could be wrought in our educational adjustment, it would 
work a revolution equally startling in the effectiveness 
of our schools, in training wise, well equipped, well in- 
formed, skillful, intelligent, and competent citizens, with 
a zealous desire for further education throughout life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
CHAPTER XXIX 
Mora TRAINING 
The Need Recognized. — There is a very general 
demand that the schools do more than they have done 
for the moral training of pupils. The demand is as 
vague as it is general. The one hopeful feature is the 
evidence that people appreciate the need. However un- 
willingly, they are compelled to admit that the agencies 
heretofore depended upon to train the young in the 
principles and practice of good conduct are not suffi- 
cient for present-day conditions. The chief of those 
agencies are the home and the church. 
One of the unhappy social tendencies of this age 
of quick changes appears to be away from the old- 
fashioned home, as the center and source of ideals and 
inspiration. Many of those who in former times would 
have been homemakers have other more absorbing aims. 
The conditions of life in large cities, especially among 
the poor, in many instances render the secluded, self- 
centered home impossible. Very large numbers of future 
citizens necessarily spend their childhood and youth 
without the sheltering care, the blood-group inspirations 
of that best of all institutions, the American home, as 
we of the older generation understand it. Even in the 
better homes there is little of the old-time definite moral 
training. Father is too busy; mother is too much 
291
-P-A-G-E-298
  292 What Children Study and Why 
“cumbered with many cares,” bridge, suffrage, mis- 
sionaries, to attend to it. 
Even the church does not and under present condi- 
tions cannot cover the field. It is sufficient to note the 
vast numbers of families that never go to church. Cer- 
tain large and populous organizations regard the church 
as in the main hostile to their interests. Unjust as this 
attitude is, it yet excludes the members of these organi- 
zations and their families from the moral training offered 
by the church, — which is our only point here. 
The school, on the other hand, is universal in its 
reach. Practically all children come under its influence. 
Hence those who see the great gaps left by the older 
agencies more and more look to the school to fill 
them. . 
Certainly, if we have not some agency, to train the 
youth to lives of virtue, we are in a parlous state. Mat- 
thew Arnold’s oft-quoted remark that “ conduct is three- 
fourths of life’? seems rather an understatement than an 
overstatement. Conduct really is practically all of life, 
the sum and the flower of all attainments, all growth, all 
experience, and if, after years of training in school, in 
the home, and in society at large, boys and girls in large 
numbers are immoral, or even unmoral, in their conduct, 
something is altogether wrong. If the old agencies 
fail in this respect, some new agency must be found, or 
civilization is doomed. All this, however, merely states 
the problem and helps very little in its solution. 
Fundamental Questions. — Certain fundamental ques- 
tions must be answered unless we are to blunder along 
in the familiar American way: 
First, what do we mean by morality?
-P-A-G-E-299
  Moral Training 293 
Second, how far and by what measures can youth be 
trained to morality? 
Third, what is the function of the school in giving such 
training? How far may it go, safely and legitimately ? 
Fourth, the above questions being determined, how 
are our schools, as at present manned and organized, to 
go about the task ? 
In a single chapter, naturally, it is impossible to give 
more than brief answers to these questions. 
Distinction between Morals and Morality. — The 
first question involves a fundamental distinction too 
commonly ignored by those people who call for courses 
in moral training, with the calm assurance that they are 
sufficient to make children upright. I refer to the dis- 
tinction between the principles of conduct resting upon 
a foundation of character and a superficial conformity to 
conventional moral standards. This distinction, which 
may be called that between morality and morals, is not 
imaginary. Itis real. Many a person is conventionally 
moral, even “ pious,” who yet lacks moral principle or 
true morality. The occasional lapses into open dis- 
honesty of people of this type simply show that although 
there was outward conformity to convention, there was 
no real morality, no real antagonism to wrongdoing, 
and when temptation arrived, moral disaster followed. 
This is quite different from hypocrisy, or the conscious 
doing of wrong while professing right. It goes far deeper 
than that. These people have believed themselves good, 
just as others have believed them good, because they con- 
formed to the prevailing code of morals. They did not 
themselves know that they were bad at heart. A part 
of the trouble at least was in their alleged moral training.
-P-A-G-E-300
  ; 
294 What Children Study and Why 
They had been trained to believe that goodness con- 
sisted in obeying rules. 
On the other hand, some of the greatest and best have 
openly and purposely defied the moral conventions of 
their times. Jesus shocked the conventionally good 
people of his time by breaking the Sabbath laws and 
in many other ways. Perhaps his greatest battle was 
against the confusion of morality with conventional 
morals. The Pharisees, who received his keenest 
shafts, were not worse than other people. They were 
_simply the conventionally good, who cared only for the 
“ outside of the cup and platter.” The bearing of this 
distinction upon the subject in hand is simply this, that 
most of the moral training suggested for schools has to 
do solely with externals. It looks toward conventional 
morals and not toward fundamental morality. Let me 
say here that I am not attacking conventional morals. 
For the average person there is no safe course open other 
than to follow them. It is only for the prophet or the 
wise independent thinker to modify them. But they are 
not to be confused with the real thing, which is sound 
character. 
Essentials of Morality. — The essentials of morality 
are properly cultivated feelings, leading to wise choices, 
a will trained to make such choices in obedience to right 
feeling, and sound moral judgment as a guide to action, 
the balance wheel of conduct; in other words, a well 
trained controlling conscience approved by moral judg- 
ment. If moral training is really to accomplish the desired 
results, it must aim at this higher goal. Otherwise the 
training, however elaborate and extensive, will do more 
harm than good, because, while it may develop a certain
-P-A-G-E-301
  Moral Training 295 
> superficial conscience, it will surely pervert the judg- 
ment and cultivate pharisaism. 
Possibility of Moral Training. — Second, to what 
extent can youth be trained to right conduct, and by 
what agencies available to the teacher? Certainly not 
by any mere catechetical method or by any system of 
instruction in the conventions of society. This does 
not mean that such instruction is not of value. It is 
more than that. It is absolutely necessary, but it is 
insufficient for the securing of good conduct. As con- 
duct is practically all of life, it is the outgrowth of life, 
and the only adequate training for it is a good life. 
That is, the subject is all-inclusive. 
In answer to our question, then: No doubt, if we could 
entirely control the environment of a child from infancy, 
could see that just the right forces worked upon him, 
that he put forth his activities in just the proper directions 
and degrees, we could train him to good conduct with 
almost certain assurance. Such a training, however, 
would require not merely omnipotence, but omniscience 
as well. Still, in spite of the inevitable limitations of 
school life and environment, much may be done toward 
the right kind of moral training. It can be done in any 
school and with any children, even the worst, provided 
the teachers rid themselves of the notion that knowl- 
edge is sufficient, especially knowledge couched in 
general terms, such as proverbs, wise sayings, command- 
ments. 
Ten Commandments Negative. — It is interesting to 
‘observe in this connection that the ten commandments 
of the ancient Jewish law, invaluable as they have been 
in the history of the moral evolution of the race, are, with
-P-A-G-E-302
  296 What Children Study and Why 
a single exception, negative; all but two begin with 
“ Thou Shalt Not,” and one of these two, the one relating 
to the Sabbath, is almost wholly prohibitive in character ; 
the sole exception is the commandment in relation to the 
treatment of parents. Hence, it will be seen that the 
ten commandments give little impulse to the higher 
moral nature. They are useful in the childhood of 
the race or of the individual, but their usefulness dis- 
appears before the rising of the true moral sense. This 
weakness was recognized by Jesus, who supplemented 
the ten commandments by the two positive commands 
so full of meaning, — “ Thou Shalt Love the Lord Thy 
God” and “ Thou Shalt Love Thy Neighbor,’ which 
express briefly the spirit of the higher modern civiliza- 
tion and the hope and ultimate end of moral development. 
They are commands to be obeyed, not in specific acts 
leaving a sense of virtue, but in the whole of life. 
They are of the essence of morality, and not its mere 
outward manifestations. As they take hold upon the 
moral nature the need for prohibitions disappears. 
Need and Dangers of Prohibitions.— In training youth, 
undoubtedly prohibitions are necessary. The earlier 
stages of moral development require restraint from with- 
out, but to stop with these is to arrest the development 
of the character, and arrested moral development, which 
is much more serious than arrested intellectual develop- 
ment, is also more common. It is shown in devotion 
to forms and to ceremonies of all kinds, from which the 
individual gets the feeling of self-complacency from virtue 
achieved, of superiority over his less virtuous neighbors, 
and of safety from the infliction of punishment, and all 
without doing any really virtuous act.
-P-A-G-E-303
  Moral Training 297 
Still, as has been said, inhibition must come into the 
moral training of children, especially in its earlier stages. 
They must be told not to do a great many things, but 
this only until they can be led to appreciate positive 
motives. The ultimate effort always must be to lead 
them into a virtuous habit of thought and feeling, so 
that good conduct will flow naturally and habitually 
from the fountains of the moral life itself. 
Order of Procedure in Conduct. — At this point it is 
necessary to consider briefly what may be called the order 
of procedure in all conduct, and it is to be feared that we 
must abandon at least the extreme views of the transcen- 
dental will as advocated by Hegel and his followers, notably 
the late William T. Harris, United States Commissioner of 
Education. While we no longer regard the faculties 
of the mind as existing in separate forms, — the intellect, 
the feelings, and the will, — still this old division rep- 
resents well enough the mental processes that lead to 
conduct, and these as outlined by Mark Hopkins still 
hold, even with the newer psychology. 
In the normal mind, and under ordinary circumstances, 
conduct begins with knowledge, which leads to feeling, 
which leads to choice. The feeling necessarily follows 
some action of the intellect. There must be some knowl- 
edge before there can be feeling. The action of the 
will, the choice, inevitably follows the feelings; the 
feelings supply the motive to all conduct. The will 
cannot act without motive; we cannot help choosing 
the action the motive for which is strongest with us. 
Willie is left at home alone. His mother said to him 
before departing, “ Willie, don’t you touch that jam 
on the pantry shelf.” Willie likes jam. He also likes
-P-A-G-E-304
t 
298 What Children Study and Why 
to do what he has been told not todo. Will he take the 
jam or will he not? It is purely a question of strength 
of motive. On the one side is his love for his mother, his 
fear of punishment if he disobeys, and whatever of con- 
science has been developed in him; on the other is 
his love for jam, and his bravado. If the former set 
of motives is the stronger with him, he will let the jam 
alone. If the latter is the stronger, then it follows that 
he must take it. He cannot do otherwise than obey the 
stronger motive. This is an epitome of the process in all 
moral acts, — Cesar at the Rubicon, Judas before the 
Elders, John at Runnymede, Father Damien looking to 
the isle of lepers, Aaron Burr at West Point. All these 
made choices, and in every case obeyed the motives that 
were strongest with them, and they could do nothing 
else. 
Harmonizes with the Bible. — While, as has been said, 
this does not harmonize with the extreme view of the 
transcendental will, it does harmonize with the teachings 
of the Bible. ‘“ As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” 
To think in the heart is to feel. ‘‘ Keep thine heart with 
all diligence for out of it are the issues of life.”” So, we 
see, the doctrine is in full accord with the best that we 
know as to moral training, and it furnishes a key for the 
teacher who would lead children to habitual right con- 
duct. It is the basis, in other words, of morality rather 
than of conventional morals. How then can its principles 
be inculcated. 
How to Inculcate Principles. — Take the order of 
procedure of conduct as above given. Knowledge must 
come first, and here is the first great danger of slipping 
into the easy rut of formality. The knowledge must be 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  Moral Training 299 
vital and not merely verbal or formal. It must be of 
such a sort as to rouse the right kind of feelings. 
Authority Insufficient. — It is not enough that the 
child know that some one has said, “ This is right, 
that is wrong.” That is the old deceptive way of au- 
thority, the basis of tyranny, ecclesiasticism, persecution, 
superstition. ‘I am authority. It is my function to 
tell you what to do. It is your duty to obey. Obey and 
you go to Heaven. Disobey and you go — elsewhere.” 
This is the religion of all tyrants, whether ecclesiastic, 
monarch, political boss, parent, or teacher. It mistakes 
obedience, the necessary but temporary support of the 
morally immature, the crutch of the morally lame, for 
the rock on which character rests. Still more feeble 
and deceptive is the apparent knowledge given in prov- 
erbs and moral sayings, which are at most but partial 
truths and sometimes not truths at all. Mark Twain 
once said, “Even a proverb may be true.” One at 
times is almost ready to think that Mark Twain exag- 
gerated. The smug satisfaction of the small mind con- 
tinually quoting “ Honesty is the best policy,” “ Early 
to bed, early to rise,” ‘‘ Spare the rod and spoil the child,” 
and the rest, not only is ludicrous, but it stands in the way 
of true moral growth, and yet many advocates of in- 
troducing moral training into schools in their suggested 
plans rise little above Sancho Panza, the greatest of all 
authorities on pregnant sayings. 
There is a special danger in proverb-fed opinions, the 
danger that exists in all half truths. The child who 
is told that honesty is the best policy, and then finds that 
it is not, — that is, that as a business policy it fails in at 
least a large number of cases, that many of those who 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  goo *- What Children Studyland Way 
make the largest fortunes make them in violation of 
honesty, or at least in suppression of it,— this child is 
quite likely to believe that his whole moral code is wrong. 
He is like the child who, discovering that he has been 
deceived in regard to Santa Claus, questions the exist- 
ence of a God. q 
Knowledge of conventions of whatever sort, whether 
based upon authority or upon accepted sayings, is a 
feeble reliance for character. It is true that a certain 
amount of conventional knowledge must be given. Chil- 
dren must know what they should not do in the ordinary 
relations of life and what they should do, as viewed by 
their associates and elders; that is, they need those of 
the ten commandments that apply to modern times. 
But this knowledge is merely for convenience, or to 
help over the stage of moral helplessness. 
Knowledge of Principles Needed. — The knowledge 
that is needed is, first, a knowledge of fundamental 
principles, because every law of right must go back to 
these. Morality is altogether social. The validity of 
its laws rests entirely upon the relations of man to 
man, and every moral maxim must be referred back to 
its social motive. It is contended that children cannot 
understand the reasons for conduct and hence must be 
guided wholly by authority. This is true doubtless with 
very young children and to a certain extent with older 
ones, but to a far less extent than most believe. The 
fundamental principles of ordinary human conduct ate 
so simple that children can understand them. It is 
not enough to say to a child, “ Thou Shalt Not Steal.” 
It is necessary and very easy in addition to this to show 
him why it is wrong to steal. The relation of parent to
-P-A-G-E-307
  Moral Training 301 
child is one that is often puzzling, and merely saying to 
the son of a drunken profligate or brute, — “‘ Honor Thy 
Father,” is not likely to prove very impressive. But 
it is possible to make the child, even of such a parent, 
understand the sort of obligations due. The plan of 
those who would teach in school abstinence from the use 
of liquors is the correct one. It aims to acquaint chil- 
dren with the effect of the use. of alcoholic stimulants 
upon life, and claims to be scientific. The validity of 
the principle is not affected by the fact that in too many 
cases the method is badly applied and exaggerations are 
indulged in which lead children later to reject all the 
teaching on the subject. 
Knowledge must Rouse Feelings. —The kind of 
knowledge given for moral purposes must be the kind 
that rouses good feelings, because feelings, as we have 
seen, are the key to conduct. Bare statements of moral 
obligations do not necessarily appeal to the feelings, and 
consequently slide off the well-oiled conscience of a child 
without resulting in conduct. This applies not merely 
to the character of the knowledge given, but to the 
method of imparting it. The aim of all instruction in 
morals must be to stimulate love for right doing and 
hatred of wrong doing, and to make such feelings habit- 
ual; that is, to develop the right kind of conscience, for 
conscience is merely a habit of feeling. 
What is meant by vital knowledge and knowledge 
that stimulates feelings will be discussed more fully a 
little later when considering the specific work of the 
school. 
Knowledge Insufficient. — Knowledge alone, whether 
of maxims or of principles, is an insufficient reliance for 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
ee ey ee, ee en ae 
302 What Children Study and Why 
those who would train the young to right conduct. There 
are really very few who do-not know what is right and 
what is wrong under ordinary circumstances, and some 
of the worst offenders against moral law are to be found 
among the most highly intelligent, even as to moral 
principles and the results of courses of conduct. 
Influence of Environment. — Vastly more important 
than all instruction is environment, the moral atmos- 
phere in which a child lives, the motives that are 
regularly presented for conduct in the ordinary com- 
monplace affairs of life, for it is not upon the unusual, 
the extraordinary, experiences that for the most part 
character is founded. Especially important is the pre- 
vailing sentiment toward people and toward conduct 
that rules in the life around the child. An atmos- 
phere of sordidness and selfishness in the home is pretty 
sure to make the child as he grows up sordid and selfish, 
while habitual altruism, consideration for others, pride 
in integrity, if found in the home and the other daily 
associations of children, furnish the strongest reliance 
possible for the development of good character along 
these lines. 
What is frequently assumed to be inheritance can 
readily enough be traced to the controlling influence of 
environment from infancy. If we could make sure that 
a child lived in the midst of the best influences steadily, 
we should have the best assurance also that he would 
grow up good, provided however he had sufficient op- 
portunity for self-development — and for battle; for 
good environment alone, involving complete protection 
from evil, is pretty sure to lead to moral breakdown 
later. Rasselas was so protected. But in real life such
-P-A-G-E-309
  Moral Training 303 
complete protection is impossible, and perhaps fortu- 
nately. A good home, however, is not impossible, to 
serve as a refuge after the battle, and, before it, to supply 
the child with the armor of self-confidence, right feeling, 
good motives, and strong determination. This is the 
ordinary reliable moral training. 
The Great Exceptions. — There is one class of excep- 
tions so important that they must be considered. Life 
does not always run along smoothly and regularly. Un- 
usual experiences come to most people, and in many lives 
such experiences seem to be controlling. There is a force 
mightier than habit due to regular environment, which 
often upsets the well-laid “ plans of mice and” parents. 
It is due to the psychological truth which we have ex- 
plained, that the motive of conduct is in the feeling. 
Strong, sudden feelings, roused by some wholly unex- 
pected influence, may throw to the winds apparently 
all the effect of good or bad environment. A violent 
appeal to the passions, a tremendous and dazzling and 
overwhelming temptation, exhibiting as the reward of 
wrongdoing “ all the kingdoms of the world and the glory 
of them,” may rush to sudden ruin the man or woman who 
has lived a normal and orderly life without any suspicion 
of such possibilities. On the other hand, inspiration, 
a sudden appeal to the better feelings, may completely 
reverse an evil course and redeem the wrongdoer. Such 
extraordinary changes are not uncommon. We see the 
drunkard reformed at a temperance meeting where his 
feelings have been greatly roused. We see the thoroughly 
bad man repentant and revolutionizing his life at a re- 
ligious revival. 
Religious feeling is doubtless the strongest of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  304. What Children Study and Why 
motives that can be used for reform or for setting young 
people on the right course. The McCauley Mission in 
New York is complete evidence of the power of such 
appeals. The work of the revivalist of the past genera- 
tion, while often futile and misleading, rested upon the 
sound foundation of the value of inspiration. 
Still these extreme cases of sudden turning to good or 
evil are rare for the ordinary boy and girl. The develop- 
ment of moral character is usually continuous and due 
to environment, the regular daily habit of life, and is in- 
fluenced mainly by society, the society of elders, the 
society of those of like age, and the society of books. 
Function of the School. — Third, having before us the 
above outlines of what constitutes moral character and 
what moral training is, and what are the main influences 
to be relied upon in the development of character in the 
young, we must consider briefly the school and its pos- 
sibilities in this direction. 
The school is just a part of life. It is an institution, 
with well defined rules of conduct and schemes of work. 
The influences that affect the moral development of the 
boys and girls in school are not different in kind from 
those that affect it outside the school. The variations 
are merely those of a particular institution. In school 
children live a normal institutional life for a limited 
number of hours daily, in personal contact with at least 
one mature mind and with a larger number of equal 
age. The character of this life is determined partly by 
the character of these associates, partly by the work to 
be done, and partly by the motives of conduct appealed 
to. The school is an institution whose chief manifest 
aim is instruction; consequently it would seem natural
-P-A-G-E-311
  Moral Training 305 
that here instruction in moral principles and maxims 
should be given. But, as has been said, the school is 
not merely an institution for instruction. It is a large 
part of the life of the child, and hence it is a place where, 
in addition to instruction, feelings should be cultivated, 
motives developed, and conduct regulated in obedience 
to the best motives, thus evolving conscience, or a cor- 
rect habit of feeling, and also moral judgment, — the 
two sources and regulators of conduct. 
What then can the school do? It can first, and chiefly, 
give the child a wholesome environment, a normally 
good and morally stimulating atmosphere, good society, 
— in short, a good life. There is a certain danger in ex- 
cessive moral instruction, the danger of causing the child 
to separate morality from life. Unhappily a very large 
portion of the religious instruction given children tends 
toward this danger. They get the notion that the ex- 
periences that count for goodness, especially in what 
is known as salvation, are quite apart from the daily 
life, and that by performing certain rites they secure to 
themselves immunity for unsocial, and hence immoral, 
conduct. The counteracting influence for this is a life 
and an environment wholly moral. 
The Teacher. — The first element having moral bear- 
ing in the life of the school is the teacher. It certainly is 
not extreme to say that with a teacher fundamentally im- 
moral, that is, with wrong social ideals and with wrong no- 
tions as to the relation between convention and morality, 
that with such a teacher a school cannot be other than 
an immoral place. But on the other hand, association 
by children with a pure-minded, high-minded man or 
woman, who directs the occupations, sets the standard, 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  306 What Children Study and Why 
and becomes the ideal of the children, cannot but be 
moral. The best teachers in the moral sense might be 
quite incompetent to give in detail much moral instruc- 
tion, and those competent to give such instruction might 
be, as moral influences for the children, among the worst. 
The teacher who bosses, who scolds, who stirs the evil 
passions of children, even though securing “ perfect 
order,” and teaching the facts of the curriculum un- 
erringly, is necessarily a bad moral influence. The 
teacher who radiates love,’ whose life in the school 
shows devotion to principle, to work, and above all to 
the children themselves, even though defective in many 
ways, cannot, from the moral standpoint, help being a 
good teacher. 
Moral Atmosphere. —It is to the teacher that the 
school owes what we know as its atmosphere. On one 
occasion some teachers were gathered on invitation in a 
house near a school to view a pyrotechnic display. Two 
little children, attendants upon the kindergarten, were 
quietly playing about the room and watching the gor- 
geous play of colors. Suddenly in the silence the teachers 
were startled to hear a childish voice say, ‘‘ Oh, thank 
you, thank you, for making the world so beautiful.” 
The principal endeavored to find the source of such 
general gratitude, and discovered that it was in the kin- 
dergarten, at whose head was a woman of the loveliest 
character, radiating gratitude and consideration for 
others continually. In other words, they had breathed 
the moral atmosphere of a school whose motive was love, 
and whose teacher was its ideal. 
Work and Motives for Work. — Next to the teacher 
the most potent influence in determining the moral in-
-P-A-G-E-313
  Moral Training 307 
fluence of school is the work done, with the motives pre- 
sented for it. Work with most people is the key to life 
and conduct. Our moral status is determined very 
largely by the work we are engaged in, and especially~ 
by the motives that we set before ourselves for doing 
work. The complaint is very common that our people 
have low aims, — to make money for money’s sake, or 
to get power for power’s sake, —that the effect of the life 
work of the average man or woman is to develop, in- 
creasingly, selfishness. Is it not true that the beginning 
of such degrading tendencies is made in too many cases 
in school? The child who is led to study for marks or 
prizes, or to avoid punishment, is on the road to a low 
standard of living. The child who works to please the 
teacher, or father or mother, is working from a much 
higher motive, and is getting a much better habit of life. 
The child who studies that he may use his acquired knowl- 
edge in some half-realized ideal life is working from the 
highest motives and is on the road to altruistic living. 
Children should work with an ever increasing sense of 
power and with determination to do their best, but not 
with any feeling of petty rivalry or hope to secure ad- 
vantage over other pupils. They should “ work for 
excellence rather than to excel.” 
Coéperation, not Solitude.— The method of con- 
ducting the school work should be such as to develop 
a spirit of codperation. The artificial and unnatural 
solitude of each child in the average schoolroom is im- 
moral. The children should all feel that the recitation 
is a codperative exercise in which they are not trying 
to show off what they individually have learned froma 
book, but are each contributing his best to the general 
   
-P-A-G-E-314
ee eee ce rt re tener, 
308 What Children Study and Why 
store from which all draw, so that at the end of a recita- 
tion every child will have done something for the common 
good, and will be richer himself for having performed 
a social duty. 
Discipline. — The third moral influence of the school 
is what is known commonly as “school discipline,” 
meaning the preservation of order, of silence, and the 
conserving of the institutional life of the school. To 
many it may seem that this should come first. But it 
seems to me that the order of the school should first 
grow out of the teacher’s personality, and second, out 
of the work done. The chief moral value of formally 
kept order in the school is in training the child to give 
proper heed to the conventions of any institution to which 
he may belong. 
Importance of Conventional Conduct. — From what I 
have said I do not wish at all to be understood as oppos- 
ing the value of conventional conduct. Good manners 
are good morals to a degree. The rules of social life 
are in the main for the preservation of individual rights 
and for making easier the common happiness. This gives 
them high moral value. Every institution has its con- 
ventions, which are at least supposed to be important to 
the institution and. to those connected with it. There 
is a certain kind of conduct suitable for the church, an- 
other for the theater, another for the home, and still 
another for the school. These conventions may have 
only a temporary validity and may not extend beyond the 
bounds of the institution itself. Still, to obey them while 
in the institution tends to cultivate the habit of con- 
sideration for others, on which they are based. 
The school has many conventions, some of them un-
-P-A-G-E-315
  Moral Training 309 
fortunately not even useful to the school itself, and most 
of them having no application to life outside the school. 
Manifestly the number of such conventions should be 
reduced to the actual necessities of the school, and obe- 
dience to them should be based upon the fact that they 
are good for that particular institution, and therefore 
for the pupils, who both belong to and own the school, 
and hence that such obedience is moral. The mistake of 
many advocates of moral instruction in school is that 
they have confused the conventional conduct of the school 
with morality itself, and fail to see that the sole moral 
value of such conduct is in establishing the mental con- 
dition required by institutional life in general. 
School Virtues. — Even certain great leaders, notably 
Dr. William T. Harris and Dr. E. E. White, used to 
claim that the schools were great moral agencies because 
they taught the school virtues, chief among which were 
silence, obedience, punctuality, and neatness. Now these 
are, to a degree, no doubt, school virtues, but their ap- 
plication to life outside of the school is extremely lim- 
ited, and their chief, if not their sole, value rests upon 
that fact that they are good for the school, and that 
children should do what is good for any institution to 
which they belong. 
Let us consider them briefly : 
Silence. — There are doubtless occasions when silence 
is a real virtue. Many a man afflicted with a talkative 
bore realizes that. But certainly there are many occa- 
sions when it would be a cowardly vice, and even in 
school it has been pushed to harmful extremes.  Still- 
ness usually indicates not industry, but the opposite. 
The corpse observes absolute silence. To make much
-P-A-G-E-316
  + 
310 What Children Study and Why 
of silence as a virtue inculcated by the school is to show 
a lack of sense of moral values. 
Obedience. — Consider obedience. It has a wider 
application than silence, and is in many cases a genuine 
virtue, but in modern life and in democracy obedience to 
the inner moral law is vastly more important than obedi- 
ence to the outer law of convention. Authority has lost 
its power in the world to a very large extent. The per- 
son who obeys unquestioningly may be doing right, he 
may be doing wrong. No adult capable of reasoning 
upon moral questions should obey unquestioningly 
except in minor matters of conventional routine. The 
boss, whether political or pedagogical, demands un- 
questioning obedience, not because of its moral value, 
but because it is personally convenient to him and his 
purposes. The training of the school should develop 
questioning obedience rather than unquestioning obedi- 
ence. Moral questions occurring for the first time should 
be submitted to a trained, broad, moral judgment. 
When that has rendered its decision, it should so appeal 
to the properly cultivated feelings that the will will 
obey without hesitation and as from habit. 
There is a moral law within to which obedience must 
always be rendered. There is a conventional law with- 
out to which obedience should be rendered when it does 
not conflict with the law within, but not otherwise. 
There is another condition that has an important bear- 
ing on the value of obedience as a virtue. Continual 
reliance upon the will of another is weakening. The boy 
or girl who has been simply obeying the behests of a 
superior unthinkingly, although his conduct may have 
been perfectly regular and proper, is likely to lack moral
-P-A-G-E-317
Moral Training 31 
judgment and strength of purpose. His life has done 
nothing to give him the power to discriminate. Hence 
the exaltation of obedience as the great school virtue 
may develop moral weakness. It certainly furnishes 
slight basis for confidence in the future welfare of demo- 
cratic society. Respect for law, as representing the 
composite will of the community looking toward general 
good, is something to be cultivated with the utmost care. 
It is a little different from respect for laws. It is very 
different from obedience to arbitrary commands, such as 
the pedagogical boss expects from his school. 
Order there must be in school, but an order that springs 
from an appreciation by the pupils of the fact that the 
school is a social institution belonging to them, that it is 
for the common good, that they are responsible to their 
own consciences as well as to the board of education for 
maintaining the institution upon a plane consistent with 
its high purpose. The degree of order required to ac- 
complish best the work of the school, to enable each in- 
dividual to do his business efficiently, can easily be main- 
tained if the students are led to realize its importance to 
themselves as well as to others. There is always dan- 
ger that enforced order will come to be worshiped as an 
idol, and this, like all substitution of lower ends for higher, 
is morally debasing. 
Briefly, the order of the school should grow out of 
obedience to the commonly recognized needs of the school 
as voiced by the teacher, in whom the pupils have con- 
fidence, and as understood by themselves. 
Punctuality. — The third of the vaunted school virtues 
is punctuality. Little need be said upon this. It is evi- 
dent that it is an economic rather than a moral virtue,   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  312 What Children Study and Why 
It has certain relations to what is called success in life and 
at times has a moral value because of its effect upon other 
people. It is desirable, of course, and to a large degree 
necessary to the well-being of the school as an institution. 
But it can easily be over-emphasized. Children not in- 
frequently will stay away from school altogether rather 
than come tardy and face the angry teacher. They will 
come to school without proper food and without proper 
care of the body rather than be late. One may say that 
all that is needed here is common sense. But common 
sense is not so very common, and the exaltation of an 
act of minor economic importance into a moral virtue pro- 
duces distortion of vision and lack of sense. 
Neatness. — The fourth standard virtue to be urged 
by the old-time moralist was neatness, — neatness of 
person and neatness of work. Neatness is of great value. 
It is a hygienic virtue, andit is also an economic virtue. 
Indirectly too it has a moral value. Still it belongs in 
the field of petty accomplishments with which the small 
mind satisfies itself of its own greatness. When urged 
in school, as it must be, it should be for reasons clearly 
expressed relating to the general good. 
Evidently these four school virtues, which our elders 
thought were the great moral contribution of the school 
to the development of the child and of society, are hardly 
big enough under democratic conditions to deserve all 
this praise. Admitting their very considerable value, 
the school must develop virtues of a much higher sort, or 
it will not be the safe reliance that it is supposed to be. 
School a Life. — This brings us then clearly to the heart 
of the matter. School to a child is a phase of life, a very 
important and often a controlling phase. It is an epitome
-P-A-G-E-319
  Moral Training 313 
of life itself. That which gives it moral quality is that 
which gives moral quality to the life of the child’s parents ; 
namely, motive following sound judgment and leading 
to conduct. The controlling influences are the same, 
which are chiefly society and literature as sources of 
ideals, and occupation, modifying, directing, and con- 
trolling, to a very large extent, the ideals, and hence the 
motives and the conduct. Besides its general char- 
acter, school life is also life in an institution, which 
makes it an even more complete epitome of the larger 
life. 
Occupation. — In order that this school life may have 
the highest moral value, the occupation must be rec- 
ognized as worth while; it must be pursued for worthy 
motives, and the conduct of the child must be regulated 
so as to further the pursuit of the occupation. 
Society. — The society must be such that the child 
receives from the teacher the best model possible for him- 
self; from his fellow pupils, help, encouragement, and 
stimulation toward right doing. 
Pupil a Contributor.— Most important of all, his 
life in this society must be not that of a mere recipient, 
but also that of a contributor. The one lesson of over- 
whelming importance for every child in school is that 
the school is a society, not only to which he belongs, but 
which belongs to him, and that it is an important factor 
in his life, that his business is not merely to learn his 
lessons and get the most possible from school, but to 
contribute both in personal conduct and in influence the 
best that he can toward making the school a good place 
for all. It is the world in little, and there is no better 
place to be found, unless it be the ideal family, for de-
-P-A-G-E-320
ee re eee pe ee 
314 | What Children Study and Why 
veloping the sense of responsibility for the common wel- 
fare than a good school. 
Altruistic Schools Possible. — Unhappily too many 
schools fail wholly to cultivate this highest virtue of 
altruism and devotion. The teacher controls. The mo- 
tives presented to the children are selfish; at the worst, to 
win prizes or marks, or to avoid punishment; at the best, 
to get knowledge. But schools upon the higher plane 
are not unknown. If the personality of the teacher is 
right and he understands his business, they are not hard 
to get. And besides, in such schools, along with the higher 
ideals and the better training, through the marvelous 
law of compensation, the children learn more and acquire 
more power. 
Illustrations. — There is not space here to give in 
detail a scheme for developing moral responsibility in 
school, but every teacher who grasps the spirit can work 
out his own scheme. [Illustrations worthy of notice are 
such institutions as the George Junior Republic, where 
even social delinquents are made socially responsible 
by being forced to carry responsibility. Another good 
illustration is found in the self-governing school, fre- 
quently in the form of a school city, by which large num- 
bers of children, many of them of foreign birth, are 
trained to that standard of good citizenship that makes 
more of duty than of privilege. For the basis of good 
citizenship is, not chiefly obedience to the external law, 
but rather obedience to the internal law, the law of love, 
whose motto is “It is more blessed to give than to 
receive,” and this can be inculcated in school. 
As has been said, the above constitutes the most im- 
portant possible contribution of the school to the moral
-P-A-G-E-321
  Moral Training 315 
education of its pupils, —living a good life for worthy ends 
earnestly pursued in good society, actuated by the spirit 
of the true citizen, feeling the responsibility for the general 
good, and contributing their best to it. This, more than 
instruction, develops moral judgment, rouses right feel- 
ing, stimulates worthy motives, and leads to right action, 
and hence it is the great function of the school from the 
moral point of view. 
Moral Instruction. — How to give wisely definite in- 
struction in morals is a very hard question. To give 
instruction that shall be directly applicable to life, that 
shall not seem to make a separation between morals and 
conduct, that shall not tend to make prigs and pharisees, 
is no easy matter. 
Attempts at Courses. — Various attempts have been 
made and courses outlined, but none that I have seen 
have been more than partially satisfactory. Perhaps the 
best is that used at the Ethical Culture School in New 
York City. This contains many excellent features, and 
teachers interested would do well to obtain a copy. In 
my judgment the course is as yet too mechanical, too 
catechetical, and falls short of the kind of knowledge 
that rouses feeling and develops motive. The best that 
it does, it seems to me, is to help in the training of moral 
judgment, and that is excellent. It is good as far as it 
goes. 
A course has recently been issued by Professor Sharp 
of the University of Wisconsin and Professor Neuman of 
the Ethical Culture School of New York, for use in high 
schools. This is an easier undertaking than to provide 
a course for elementary schools, because the pupils are 
older, more capable of reasoning, and are at the period 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
316 What Children Study and Why 
of second birth, when they are reaching out eagerly for 
ideals. This course has many excellent features, and is 
certainly worth study by any teacher planning to give in- 
struction in morals. The first-year work is perhaps the 
best, in that it aims to stimulate motives and create ideals. 
The courses for the later years, though having many 
excellencies, fall short in this respect and seem rather 
mechanical. Their chief aim apparently is to develop 
the moral judgment, and that, as said above, is good as 
far as it goes. 
General Course Impossible. —I am not sure that a 
general course for the use of teachers in elementary 
schools is possible. At least none has yet been offered 
that is satisfactory. 
Possibilities of the School. — What can the school as 
at present organized and manned do? The first difficulty 
is in the limitations of the teacher herself. Our teachers 
as a class are of the highest quality morally. I doubt if 
any other body of people in the world have as high moral 
ideals as the teachers. But in this country a very large 
majority of them are young girls of immature minds and 
limited experience, hardly capable of grasping the great 
moral questions of life so completely as to fit them to im- 
part them again. The most that can be expected of 
these young people is that they shall teach the children 
in a simple way the plain conventional moralities, and 
with the little children that is perhaps enough. They can 
teach them the school virtues of promptness, obedience, 
neatness, and silence. They can tell them to keep their 
hands and faces clean, not to use bad language, to be 
polite, and all the other common and necessary forms of 
virtuous conduct for children. But even this cannot well  
-P-A-G-E-323
  Moral Training : B17. 
be done systematically. It must be done upon occasion. 
The time to teach a child to be clean is when he is dis- 
posed to be dirty, to teach him to obey is when he is 
inclined to be disobedient, to emphasize punctuality is 
when there arises a tendency to tardiness, and to teach 
the importance of silence is when he is disposed to talk 
too much. The watchful teacher will take advantage of 
the opportunities that rise continually in school to im- 
press these simple virtues, and by so doing will impress 
them much more effectively than if she takes a book and 
on Monday teaches silence, on Tuesday punctuality,.on 
Wednesday obedience, on Thursday neatness, reviews 
on Friday and repeats next week. 
Value of Discussion. — The wise teacher will not only 
teach these things as occasion arises, but she will not rely 
wholly upon authority for inculcating them. She will 
talk over with the pupils instances, real or imaginary, 
which illustrate what she would teach, will encourage 
them to discuss among themselves why children should 
be on time and should be clean and should obey the 
rules, and should not talk when others are talking or 
when it will disturb those who want to study. In this 
way she will cultivate their moral judgment; and also by 
putting emphasis upon the rights of others, upon the 
harm that the tardy pupil and the disobedient pupil 
and the dirty pupil and the noisy pupil do to others, 
she will develop the social sense and the sense of obliga- 
tion for the general good. Any good, bright girl fit to 
be a teacher can do these things. But if you put into 
her hands a catechism and instruct her to teach funda- 
mental morals from a book she is likely to break down. 
The difficulty increases as the pupils advance in age, are
-P-A-G-E-324
  318° What Children Study and Why 
better able to reason, and need more and more to under- 
stand the underlying principles. Very few teachers are 
competent to do this work as it should be done. 
‘Lack of Material. — Here begins the need for books 
and other means of instruction, and here again we are up 
against a blank wall. There are no books and there are 
no means of instruction, excepting such as are furnished 
by occasion or may be adapted from other uses, and as 
I have said, there are no courses of study that more than 
approximately cover the field. The Bible, which would 
be altogether the best textbook under present conditions, 
cannot be used, strangely enough, not because of opposi- 
tion from atheists or agnostics, but from the very people 
who are clamoring for religious instruction, — apparently 
because they fear that some church not their own will 
catch the product, and it is better to let children grow up 
in ignorance of the Bible than to have them join any other 
church than “ ours.” 
Religious Instruction Impossible. — Religious instruc- 
tion is out of the question. It is not necessary to dis- 
cuss its value here, because under the constitutions of 
our nation and states, and especially in view of prevail- 
ing sentiment, it cannot be given in public schools. 
Doubtless, too, that is wise, because the teachers are very 
few who could teach religion divorced from sectarianism. 
(It is much easier, and hence much more common, to 
teach it divorced from conduct.) 
Conduct, Individual. — Further, it is by no means cer- 
tain that a general course in morals, even if ideal, would — 
accomplish the good:hoped for. Conduct is so largely 
an individual matter, environment creates such par- 
ticular needs, that it is not certain that the instruction
-P-A-G-E-325
Moral Training 319 
given should not be specially and locally adapted. The 
great foundation principles of love, of the duties that we 
owe to others, of devotion, of self sacrifice, of democracy 
of spirit, naturally should underlie all instruction, but 
these cannot be imparted by instruction. They must 
appear in life, and in so far as they appear in instruc- 
tion, they must be simply the spirit and the inspiration. 
Use of Stories and Poems. — Perhaps the easiest way 
to produce the desired moral impressions is through 
literature, — poems and stories, both fictional and real, 
adapted to the children’s needs, with the moral not stated, 
but implied. Stories of heroism, stories of sacrifice, 
stories of nobility of conduct, stories of the struggle of 
great men to achieve places of usefulness, tend to rouse 
and foster ideals. Such stories in the first place should 
not tell of virtue rewarded and vice punished. We have 
had altogether too much of ‘‘ Honesty is the best policy,” 
“ Be good and you will be happy,” and ‘“‘ Murder will 
out,” — time-worn lies that vitiate the moral sense. 
Moral training must rest upon other grounds than the 
hope of reward or the fear of punishment. It must grow 
out of ideals and feelings leading to conduct itself and not 
considering either the price paid or the reward sought. 
Models should be Great Servants. — The men whose 
names are used as models should be those who have con- 
tributed rather than those who have simply got rich, — 
Moses who gave up life at court to help his people and 
was great, not because he was their general, but because 
of his sacrifice for them; Jesus, whose whole life was 
sacrifice; the apostles and missionaries to the western 
world; among the explorers of this country, not Cortez 
and the others who sought riches, but the priests who 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  320 What Children Study and Why 
came to redeem the savages; among Englishmen, not 
Wellington and Nelson, but Howard, John Bright, and 
Gladstone; among our own people, not our successful 
multimillionaires, but Washington, Lincoln, Lee, John 
Eliot, Dr. Lazur, and Dr. Blue. 
In the field of fiction we should have optimistic stories 
showing the same spirit. For young children, the 
Fairy Stories of Grimm are mostly objectionable, be- 
cause they are immoral, while those of Andersen are 
excellent. 
Principal should Prepare Local Course. — But, as is 
evident, this is all indirect instruction. How can we 
make it direct? Chiefly by discussion with the class. 
My suggestion is that for the present at least each school 
principal interested in the subject prepare a course suited 
to the children of his locality, talk it over with the teachers, 
select suitable literature to illustrate the virtues that he 
thinks the children most lack; and if necessary prepare 
outlines for the grades, simply to be used as guides by 
the teachers in talking over the stories with the children. 
The stories in all cases should be such as to rouse a feel- 
ing of admiration for the one possessing the virtue, which 
should be transferred into a love for the virtue itself, 
the latter by discussion. All such discussion should be 
free, though carefully guided by the teacher, and under 
this guidance the thought of the children should be 
taken back constantly to the underlying principle of all 
morality, love for others, and a desire to lend a hand on all 
possible occasions. 
In this way in the towns and cities a great deal of 
valuable material would be gathered, and at least the 
beginnings made, of a course of instruction in morals.
-P-A-G-E-327
    Moral Training 321 
Naturally those who were working out such a course would 
want to confer with others doing the same thing, and the 
result would be a consensus of opinion and in time a cer- 
tain degree of harmony in material and method, which 
would take the moral training of the children in schools 
out of the haphazard class and make it definite and pur- 
poseful, though not fixed and mechanical. 
Rural Schools. —In the rural schools and the near 
rural schools, where generally there is little supervision, 
each teacher will have to do what she can, and here is 
where a good textbook, if a good textbook is possible, 
would do the most good. But even the rural schools 
have a certain amount of supervision in most cases from 
the county superintendent, who could outline a course 
affecting rural conditions which the teachers could use. 
Necessity for Empiricism.—TIt is true that this is all 
empirical, but it is only by such empirical work that we 
can hope to arrive at results at all satisfactory or even 
permanent. The committee that starts out now to make 
a course of study for formal instruction in morals can do 
nothing more than follow precedent, and is very sure to 
be at the end far away from the lives of the children, but 
a local course growing out of an appreciation of the needs 
of the pupils will be vital, and in the hands of a wise 
teacher very useful, and from many such courses some 
results may be obtained that will be of general value. 
Conclusion and Résumé. — In conclusion, it must be 
apparent to any who have had the patience to read this 
chapter that it is the author’s belief that the main busi- 
ness of the school in regard to the morals of children is to 
supply them with a good life, consisting of good occupa- 
tion, engaged in for good motives, and pursued under
-P-A-G-E-328
  322 What Children Study and Why 
the stimulation of proper incentives ; that the atmosphere 
must be pure and sweet and inspiring, the teacher “good 
society ” for the children, and the social life of the school 
coéperative, unselfish, and for the common good; that 
through this life children may be trained to democracy, 
which in its last analysis is not a form of government, 
but is a state of mind. 
The author further believes that formal instruction, 
while of secondary importance, is important, but under 
present conditions it is not possible to say just how it 
should be given. Religious dogma cannot be used. The 
catechetical form of instruction long ago ceased to exert 
much influence. There is little already prepared material 
for direct instruction available. There are no textbooks 
that are satisfactory, and it is doubtful if any can be 
made that will be of general use. The best course for 
the present seems to be for local centers to provide their 
own courses, relying much on literature and biography 
and upon class discussions of the stories and poems, 
with the hope that out of many such local courses, in 
time something of more general usefulness may be 
evolved.

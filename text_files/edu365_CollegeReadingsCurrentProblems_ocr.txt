INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
A .1BERAL education, as Milton in his Tractate says, aims 
to fit a man to “perform justly and magnanimously all the 
offices both private and publick of Peace and War.” 
Whatever else the American college accomplishes, its 
function is at least that of graduating prospective citizens. 
Efficient membership in the Republic must depend upon a 
knowledge of the outstanding issues of the times, intellec- 
tual and philosophical no less than political, and a sound 
judgment in their settlement. 
College courses in composition logically and conven- 
iently contribute to this broad training. The undergradu- 
ate, facing and analyzing these recurrent problems, seldom 
fails to respond with the clear and constructive thinking 
and the lively expression which justify such courses. 
The present collection supplies material for thought- 
provoking assignments in oral and written composition. 
The student examines in turn the insistent questions of 
education, intellectual and moral ideals, science, literature, 
government, national character, international politics, 
sociology, and economics. He grapples with such ques- 
tions as, What education is most worth while? How far 
shall freedom of thought and discussion be tolerated? Is 
the church decadent? Will science destroy or invigorate 
civilization? Has American literature national individual- 
ity? Does the American novel truthfully reflect contem- 
porary American life? In a progressive democracy is 
cabinet government preferable to the congressional type? 
What are the most practicable programs for preventing 
international wars? Is internationalism consistent with 
patriotism? What are the best means of promoting re- 
9143

spect for law? What shall be the ultimate basis of immi- 
gration? Is socialism practicable? How shall harmony 
between capital and labor be effected? 
The college student who discusses these themes, who 
thinks and writes about them, acquires something more 
than added information and added opinions. He gets 
some notion of the problem as a whole. He is encouraged 
to piece together his economic, social, and other ideas into 
a unified philosophy. Under the direction of a capable 
instructor that philosophy will promise breadth and sanity. 
These selections obviously offer no complete statement 
of the various fields of human thinking. Neither does each 
individual article pretend to give an exhaustive discussion 
of the specific topic. ‘These essays and addresses, never- 
theless, deal with persistent issues and set forth the ideas 
in language and modes of thinking that are significant. 
Rightly used, the material will lead to detailed investiga- 
tion and to matured convictions. 
Each selection may be analyzed in detail for methods of 
composition. The underlying purpose, the order of topics, 
the proportion, paragraphing, the sentence, details of dic- 
tion, the imaginative and intellectual qualities, the exposi- 
tory and argumentative elements may be studied. The 
instructor may assign analytical outlines, argumentative 
briefs, or abstracts of the articles. It is assumed that in 
the classroom the material will be freely criticized and 
weighed from every angle. It will furnish the basis for 
formal speeches and for original articles and arguments, 
oral and written. The student may develop either a gen- 
eral subject suggested by the selection, or he may apply the 
principles to some immediate problem of the campus. Out 
of it all he gets added knowledge of contemporary life, a 
technique for work and reflection, an individual method of 
expression — and some genuine education.

WHAT IS EDUCATION? # 
ARTHUR T. HADLEY 
Waar is Education? The answer to this question is not so 
simple as appears at first sight. In fact there are two 
different and somewhat conflicting answers. According to 
nearly all the dictionaries, both English and American, the 
primary meaning of the word, which underlies all others, 
is the imparting of knowledge. Education is treated as 
synonymous with instruction. The teacher is regarded as 
the active agent, busy in storing the pupil’s mind with the 
things he needs to know. In putting this meaning of the 
word first and giving it most prominence, the dictionaries 
are simply following current popular usage. It is probable 
that eighty per cent of the American school teachers, and 
ninety per cent of the American public, would approve of 
what the dictionaries have done. 
But there is another sense in which the word is employed, 
which is equally important and quite different. We may 
regard education as a training for the varied work of life — 
industrial, social, and political — in which knowledge is 
not an end but an incident; in which the student is learning 
to do things; in which the teacher is no longer the sole di- 
recting agency, but one among many cooperating agencies, 
. for the attainment of this end. To set forth this meaning

  4 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
of education no better words can be found than those used 
by John Milton in his Tractate nearly three centuries ago: 
“T call therefore a compleat and generous Education that 
which fits a man to perform justly and magnanimously all 
the offices both private and publick of Peace and War.” 
Now the mere fact that the term Education is em- 
ployed in two distinct senses is not surprising or unusual. 
Nearly every word in the English language which deals 
with a complex conception has more than one meaning. 
What is unusual and surprising in this particular case is 
that two distinct meanings are regarded by almost every- 
body, dictionary-makers included, as being mere varia- 
tions of the same meaning. ‘Training is regarded as an 
incidental result of knowledge, rather than as a distinct 
process of learning to do things. 
When two meanings of an important word like education 
have become thus confused in the public mind, so that in- 
struction and training are treated as pretty nearly synony- 
mous, it results in much loose thinking; and what is worse, 
in much misapplied power and profitless expense. We as- 
sume that we are necessarily training citizens when we are 
imparting knowledge, and vice versa. To check this sort 
of fallacious reasoning, and this waste of money and power, 
we must choose one sense of the word education as the 
basis of public discussion, and stick to it. We may either 
define education as the imparting of knowledge, and call 
the development of a man’s power by the name of training; 
or we may follow John Milton in regarding education as 
preparation for citizenship, and call the imparting of 
knowledge by the name of instruction. Either method is 
good enough, provided we adhere to it consistently. The 
choice between the two must be determined by practical 
considerations. 
If we were considering education from the standpoint of 
the psychologist only, it would not make much difference
-P-A-G-E-11
  ARTHUR T. HADLEY 5 
which we chose. But we are considering it from the stand- 
point of the political economist. We are concerned to find 
out what a democratic and progressive community like 
ours requires of its citizens and how the schools can help 
them to get it. These requirements are admirably set 
forth in the passage of Milton which I have just quoted. 
‘Let us therefore accept this as the basis for our definition of 
education and call it preparation for the varied activities 
of citizenship. The process of imparting knowledge we 
shall then call instruction. Instruction is and always will 
be an important element in education; knowledge is and 
always will be of exceptional value to the citizens of a free 
commonwealth. But the acquisition of knowledge is not 
the end of education as we are now using the terms; it is 
simply an incident in the larger and more important pro- 
cess of training for citizenship. 
In thus expanding our definition of education, so as to 
view it from the public standpoint, we are really going 
back to the primary meaning of the word, instead of getting 
away from it.“ To educate is to educe; to make something 
out of a maf rather than to put something into him. Let 
us examine briefly how a modern commonwealth must go 
to work to bring out the qualities needed in its members, 
how far our present school system contributes to that end, 
and what we can do to make this contribution more effec- 
tive. Let us view education provisionally as the process 
by which the human animal is fitted for membership in 
civilized society, and see where this way of looking at 
things leads us in the way of theoretical propositions and 
practical results. 
Every community, however rude, must develop certain 
habits of discipline to make it strong in time of war, and 
certain habits of decency which serve to keep it safe in 
time of peace. Among communities which are at all 
civilized, the requirements of discipline take the form of a
-P-A-G-E-12
6 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
social order which affords some protection to the members 
of the tribe who are physically weak, and the requirements 
of decency make some provision for cleanness of body and 
mind — at least at stated seasons. A civilized community 
must also develop certain habits of prudence, so that the 
labors of the present may serve to meet the needs of the 
future. Order, cleanness, and prudence seem to be the 
fundamental things which distinguish civilization from 
barbarism; and for a community which is governed by an 
absolute monarch or by a religious oligarchy they seem to 
represent about all that is essential as a basis for citizen- 
ship. 
But a free commonwealth needs something more than 
this. If a community is to enjoy civil liberty it must de- 
velop habits of self-control among the great body of its 
members and habits of leadership among a considerable 
number of them. And habits of self-control or leadership 
are far harder to secure than habits of order, cleanness, and 
prudence. For order, cleanness, and prudence can be im- 
posed and maintained by authority from above; while self- 
control and leadership have their source and their suste- 
nance in each man’s own soul. If we give a man liberty 
to do right we give him liberty to do wrong. The only 
security that the community has against the misuse of 
self-control or leadership lies in the vision and intelligence 
of its members. They must have the vision to see and feel 
what the community needs to have them see and feel; so 
that ideals of order and cleanness and upbuilding which 
tend to carry them forward will have a stronger and more 
constant appeal than the mere animal instincts which tend 
to carry them backward. And they must have intelligence 
to know how these ideals are to be compassed; so that the 
pursuit of their visions will lead them and their followers 
in the general direction in which they want to go — not 
backward into the wilderness but forward into the promised
-P-A-G-E-13
  
  ARTHUR T. HADLEY 7 
land. To the habit by which vision is acquired we give the 
name imagination; to the habit by which intelligence is 
acquired we give the name of thinking. 
These habits are what the nations of Europe and 
America have had to learn, gradually and painfully; these 
are what their individual members have had to learn, in 
order to fit themselves for citizenship in the free com- 
munities of the modern world. To help in the difficult 
process of learning these habits, nations have developed 
many kinds of educational agencies. For teaching habits 
of order or decency, we have the family and police. For 
teaching habits of prudence we have private property. 
For teaching habits of imagination, in the largest and tru- 
est sense of the word, we have the theater, the press, and 
the church. And for teaching habits of thinking we have 
the schools. 
Of course these several kinds of training are hard to de- 
fine accurately; and the separate agencies will often over- 
lap one another in their educational work. The schools 
have a good deal to do in teaching order and decency; 
partly because so many of their pupils have come from 
families which cannot do their work as well as it needs to 
be done, and partly because there are some principles of 
social order and decency which can be learned more easily 
by large groups of children than by small ones. For some- 
what similar reasons a good school will do a good deal of 
incidental work in training the imagination. But the 
primary duty of the school is to teach the habit and train 
the powers of thinking; and if it neglects this for the sake 
of its secondary functions, it throws the whole educational 
system of society as completely out of gear as does the 
church when it is more occupied in teaching people what 
they should think than in inspiring them with its ideals or 
as does the police when it is so overloaded with other duties 
that it fails to keep order effectively.  
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
But how shall we go to work to teach the habit and train 
the powers of thinking? In answering this question Ameri- 
can school boards and American public opinion have been 
constantly led astray by our habit of confusing the two 
different senses of the word education. Nine people out of 
ten believe that the way to train a boy to think is to impart 
as much knowledge to him as possible. They do not dis- 
tinguish between the possession of information and the 
power or habit of thought; or at any rate they assume that 
if you can secure the former, the latter follows as a matter 
of course. 
In no other field of life do we meet this confusion. No 
sensible man could think that the way to train a boy to ride 
was to give him as many horses as possible, or that if you 
could secure the necessary horses the riding would follow 
as a matter of course. And yet this way of looking at 
things would be as near the truth about riding as it is 
about thinking. The impulse to ride is certainly quite as 
universal as the impulse to think. The horse furnishes 
the necessary basis for the rider, just as the knowledge 
furnishes the necessary basis for the thinker. But this 
does not mean that you should begin your training by giv- 
ing a boy as many horses, or as much knowledge, as he can 
possibly want. It is better to let him really learn to ride 
on one or two horses — borrowed ones if necessary — and 
fill his stable afterward with such animals as best suit his 
purposes. It is better to let him really learn to think on 
one or two subjects — subjects which he is very likely to 
forget all about — and afterward fill his mind, or even his 
library shelves, with the precise information which he is 
going to use. 
Perhaps I seem to be wasting time over this point; but 
its importance has been brought home to me by personal 
experience. During each year of my life as a college presi- 
dent, scores of parents or guardians coming from the most
-P-A-G-E-15
ARTHUR T. HADLEY 9 
intelligent classes of the community have asked me with 
apparent surprise whether the acquisition of knowledge 
was not the all-important end of a college course, for the 
sake of which the institution existed. These men knew 
enough to despise the futility of mere acquisition in all 
other lines of business. They knew that even in matters of 
scholarship the most learned man was often far from being 
the most useful man. But when it came to the training of 
their own children, they persisted in regarding the boy’s 
mind as a sort of reservoir, into which knowledge was to be 
poured by different teachers in proper proportion. What 
actually was the proper proportion was a question on which 
they differed a good deal. Some thought that their boys 
should learn about things they were going to use in after 
life, because these were what they needed to know; others 
thought that they should learn about things which they 
were not going to use in after life, because these were what 
they would never learn except in college. But there was 
pretty nearly unanimous agreement in overvaluing the 
subject matter taught in the classroom, as compared with 
that which the boy would get for himself in college and in 
after life if he had formed right habits of reading or think- 
ing. There was a discouraging failure to see that if the 
boy was to acquire the habits of reading or thinking 
effectively on any line whatever he must work for it him- 
self, and his father must expect him to work for it. A good 
teacher can show him how to work to the best advantage 
and save waste effort; he can speed up the educational pro- 
cess by warning against false starts and unnecessary ex- 
periments; but in learning to do anything, whether to ride 
or to think, the boy is the active agent; the teacher is only 
the director or at best the inspirer. Doing can be learned 
only by doing. 
Through our failure to understand some of these cardinal 
principles, the history of American education represents the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
10 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
confused result of a series of cross-currents of opinion, in 
the teaching profession and outside of it, rather than a 
progressive approach toward a well-defined goal of public 
policy. 
In the early years of the republic, our American schools 
taught only a few things. Most of their pupils got no 
farther than the “three R’s” —reading, writing, and arith- 
metic. Those who could add a little grammar, geography, 
or history to this meager bill of fare might count themselves 
fortunate. Even in college this limited scheme of studies 
was not very much widened. The only real change was 
that the reading lessons were in Latin or Greek instead of in 
English, and that “problems” in Algebra or Trigonometry 
took the place of “sums” in Arithmetic. To the modern 
critic, this curriculum seems poor and barren. Yet with 
all its poverty and barrenness, the education of our grand- 
fathers had two great advantages which went far to balance 
its defects. In the first place it taught the boys habits of 
hard work. Whether they were writing English, or trans- 
lating Greek, or solving problems in mathematics, they 
were doing something themselves, and usually something 
pretty hard, without getting very much help from the 
teacher — unless you call it “help” to have a prospect of 
being punished if the work is not done. In this school of 
hardship, habits were formed which enabled men to do 
difficult things for the sake of a remote end. “When I 
take a college graduate into railroad service,” said one of 
the best operating men in the country, “I prefer one who 
has had the old-fashioned training in Greek; because he is 
accustomed to work hard to find exactly what a writer 
says. If he has handled a Greek dictionary to any purpose, 
he does not expect a book to be easy, or think that he can 
guess what it means with any chance of coming out right.” 
This was one thing which our grandfathers were taught; 
and they were also taught to regard the school or college
-P-A-G-E-17
  ARTHUR T. HADLEY 11 
course as the beginning of their education rather than the 
end of it. The actual knowledge which they learned was 
moderate in amount and slight in human interest. What 
the school or college did for them was to place instruments 
in their hands by whose use they could teach themselves 
the things they needed to know. The man who could read 
could inform himself on public affairs. The man who could 
read, write, and reckon could do his share of the world’s 
business, and learn for himself the intellectual and moral 
lessons which come from the handling of property. The 
fact that the pursuit of practical knowledge was an “extra- 
curriculum activity” did not prevent our grandfathers from 
getting such knowledge. 
For a boy with a taste for books, under a teacher who 
knew how to reward as well as to punish, the old system 
was a good one. Many of the academies of Central New 
York in the early years of the nineteenth century developed 
among the pupils a proportion trained for the successful 
pursuit of science or letters which a modern high school 
with wider curriculum and larger appliances might well 
envy. But there are unfortunately a great many boys with 
little taste for books as books; and with such boys it took 
a very good teacher indeed to prevent the old system from 
degenerating into a treadmill, where the scholars hated the 
work so much that it never helped them to form a habit of 
reading or study. 
To meet the needs of this wider group of students was 
the goal of most of our educational reformers of the nine- 
teenth century. The first step in this direction came with 
the establishment of professional schools of medicine, the- 
ology, law, and applied science, where a man could be 
taught some of the things which he needed for the practice 
of his calling. The second step was the introduction of 
similar subjects into the curriculum of the colleges them- 
selves — usually in the form of brief lecture courses or
-P-A-G-E-18
  12 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
recitations from a text-book — so that the student might 
get a taste of as many kinds of knowledge as possible. The 
third step was the extension of these ideas downward into 
the high schools, and in some degree into the common 
schools, so that every pupil had the chance to learn some- 
thing of the results of modern science, and to ground him- 
self in subjects of practical value like bookkeeping. The 
fourth step was the development of the laboratory method 
in its varied forms, in which the student gained his know- 
ledge and his habits of thought by seeing and handling 
things instead of reading about them. The fifth step was 
the acceptance of the elective system. The numbers of 
subjects introduced into the school and college curriculum 
had become so vast that it was impossible to allow adeé- 
quate time for the thorough mastery of any. The student 
was therefore given constantly increasing opportunity to 
make a choice of a few subjects out of the large numbers 
offered, and was encouraged to select those which he liked 
best. 
The order in which these steps were taken differed some- 
what in different places; but the general movement, and its 
results for good or for evil, were felt in pretty much the 
same way throughout the whole country. On the whole, 
the good vastly outweighed the evil. The schools in 1875 
aroused more interest, taught more knowledge, and gave 
more of the rather indefinable thing which we call culture 
than those of 1800 ever thought of doing. But there is a 
less bright side to the picture of which something has al- 
ready been said at the beginning of this article. Our nine- 
teenth-century courses of study did not always develop the 
habit and power of independent thinking among their 
students in the same way that they developed their interest 
and increased their knowledge. The lectures in the nine- 
teenth-century schools of law and medicine were designed 
to give the pupil information. The curricula of the col-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
ARTHUR T. HADLEY 18 
leges and high schools were arranged with the same 
dominant purpose. Anybody who asked about the dis- 
ciplinary value of a study was regarded as hopelessly old- 
fashioned. 
But the old fashion had a good deal of right on its side. 
Real thinking is hard work. It is a serious discipline to 
form the habit; it requires a disciplined mind to keep it up. 
If a pupil in a kindergarten has been led to confuse work 
with play, and told to stop when he begins to get tired, it 
will not be easy for him ever to acquire that discipline. If 
a college student is encouraged to elect only the things that 
interest him, there is great danger that he will find no 
interest in the hard parts of thinking — examination of 
evidence, testing of hypotheses, rigid insistence on logic — 
and will choose the easy road to knowledge rather than the 
hard road to power. 
During the last forty or fifty years we have begun to see 
this. Our best schools of law and medicine no longer make 
lectures or text-books their chief reliance, but try from the 
outset to train their pupils in the habits of thought which 
will equip them for their profession. The most progressive 
colleges have abandoned the principle of indiscriminate 
election, and insist on choice of groups of subjects whose 
study shall fit a man to do something.. The proper use of 
the laboratory as a place of research or of manual training 
is being separated from its improper use as an advanced 
kindergarten. The best examiners are no longer satisfied 
to make their papers tests of knowledge, and are trying to 
make them tests of power. 
The type of education which we had inherited from the 
eighteenth century taught boys and girls what intellectual 
work meant; but it gave them so few subjects of human 
interest to think about that they did not generally acquire 
the habit of thinking, except on practical matters of busi- 
ness or politics which came immediately before their eyes in
-P-A-G-E-20
  
  14 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
after life. The type of education which we developed in 
the first three quarters of the nineteenth century went to 
the opposite extreme. It furnished subjects of human in- 
terest in great abundance; but it gave the majority of the 
pupils no idea of the hard work in the way of intellectual 
effort and self-control, which was involved in really think- 
ing about them. It made the mistake of assuming that 
the imparting of knowledge was the main thing that so- 
ciety required of the schools; that the more knowledge you 
gave, and the easier you made it for the pupils to get it, the 
better it was. 
But if we can bring our minds back to the public purpose 
of education we shall see that much of this nineteenth- 
century effort went wide of the mark. Society is not con- 
cerned with what its members know, but with the use they 
can make of their knowledge. It wants men who can verify 
information, see what bearing it has on their own conduct, 
and act accordingly. This is thinking, in the practical 
sense of the word; and the habit of thinking in this sense 
is the thing that it is vitally essential to have the schools 
teach, whatever else they do or leave undone. The ac- 
quisition of knowledge is generally a good thing, just as 
the acquisition of property is generally a good thing. But 
if a man who has not learned business habits acquires a 
great deal of property with comparatively little effort on 
his own part, it seldom does much good, either to him or 
to society, and often does a good deal of harm; and the 
same thing appears to be true of knowledge. 
But, some one will say, “ Where will the people get their 
knowledge if not in the schools?” They will get it in the 
same way that they now get nine tenths of it; through ob- 
serving what they see, listening to what they hear, and 
reading what they require in books and periodicals. The 
thing for the schools to do is to teach them to observe and 
listen, and above all else to read. Before the art of print-

ing was invented the teacher had to give his pupils the in- 
formation they needed; now that we have books and news- 
papers, it is enough for him to teach them how to get it and 
get it right. He cannot train the boy to compete with the 
encyclopeedia; he can train him to use the encyclopedia. 
If parents and teachers can once recognize that it is the 
business of the student to get the information and of the 
teacher to show him how, we shall have laid the foundation 
for a twentieth-century school system which shall combine 
the merits of both of those which have preceded it. For 
the boy who has formed the habit of reading what interests 
him with care and attention finds it easy to keep up the habit 
of thinking about it. 
If the pupil is expected to read things for himself, we can 
cut from our high schools and colleges nearly all these 
courses whose primary object is to give information, and 
concentrate the teacher’s power in helping his pupils to do 
their own reading and thinking to the best advantage. We 
cannot well remove all information courses from our pri- 
mary schools or the grammar schools; partly because the 
children in the lower grades have not yet learned to read 
well enough or easily enough to be expected to get all their 
information from the printed page, and partly because in- 
formation courses, in the hands of a good teacher, may be 
made an effective means in helping to form habits of order 
and of imagination which are quite as important for the 
very young pupils as habits of thinking. But if we can 
reduce them to a minimum in the high schools and take 
them wholly out of the curriculum in the colleges, we shall 
cut down the cost of education at a point where it is now 
very large, both in the aggregate and per capita. We can- 
not put everybody through a single course of study as our 
grandfathers tried to do; for there are three or four differ- 
ent types of mind that have to be reached by different 
methods and developed in different ways. But we can do 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 WHAT IS EDUCATION? 
away with the idea that each student must have a chance 
to learn the particular subject he is going to use in after 
life, and substitute the better and more economical plan of 
training him in methods that he is going to use by subjects 
which he probably will not use. We can train him for the 
kind of profession for which he is fitted instead of attempt- 
ing to forestall the professional school or the office in teach- 
ing him the details of its practice. 
But what of the boy who, when he reaches high-school 
or college age, is too lazy or too uninterested to do his own 
part in his education, and get the necessary information 
by reading? To this question there is but one answer. 
Take him out of school and set him to work. 
I am afraid that this suggestion will provoke a good deal 
of adverse criticism. There is a general feeling that edu- 
cation is so good a thing, and indoor work in shops so un- 
desirable for growing boys and girls, that we ought to try 
to keep everybody in school, as far as we can, till the age of 
sixteen or seventeen. If going to school means education 
in the full and proper sense of the word, as distinct from 
merely sitting at a desk and picking up information, this is 
probably true. But if the student is going to evade doing 
his part in his own education, then I say that it is better 
for him to work nine hours in a shop than to shirk five 
hours, play two hours and loaf two hours — which is about 
what he generally does if compelled to go to a school where 
he does not pull his weight in the boat. And it is not only 
better for him; it is infinitely better for the other pupils and 
for the teachers. By taking away two or three members 
who are a drag upon the whole body we allow far more 
education to be given to all the others with far less waste 
effort. Even if the transfer of a considerable number of 
young people from the school to the shop should make it 
necessary to have a somewhat increased force of factory 
inspectors, it would be far cheaper for society to employ

that agency than to make use of the public school system 
as an asylum for the willfully uninterested. Higher educa- 
tion at public expense should be regarded as a privilege 
to be earned, not as a right to be abused. 
Some progressive nations have gone even farther than 
this. In all commercial and technical courses in German 
high schools a small fee has been charged, which was not 
remitted except as a prize for conspicuously good and faith- 
ful work. The Germans did not adopt this practice for the 
sake of the income which it brings in — in fact, the sum 
charged represents less than a quarter of the expense of 
the instruction — but because the fact of having to pay a 
fee prevented a boy from choosing a course for which he 
had no special fitness, and made sure that both he and his 
parents would codperate with the teachers to see that he 
got his money’s worth. The efficiency of the course was 
thus trebled or quadrupled. Whether we are prepared to 
go as far as this or not, it offers us a lesson which is worth 
considering. or the usefulness of a school or college 
education depends in the last resort upon the mental atti- 
tude of the student, more than upon anything which the 
teacher can do. 
A plan which thus defines education, emphasizes its 
public purpose, and relieves the teacher from responsibili- 
ties which properly belong to the student promises not 
only to increase the efficiency of our school system but 
also to solve the salary problem in a way satisfactory to 
both teacher and taxpayer. For a reduction in the number 
of subjects taught means fewer teachers and larger aver- 
age classes. The active codperation of the pupil and the 
elimination of the shirker mean that these large classes can 
be handled with better effect than at present. The benefit 
of this increased efficiency can be so shared between teach- 
ers and taxpayers that we can pay decidedly increased sala- 
ries from a somewhat lower aggregate budget. By securing

these reforms we could, for the first time in many years, 
claim to have put our school system on an economic basis; 
for we should be employing our teachers under conditions 
which make for maximum efficiency in their work and 
maximum value of their product.

THE UNDERGRADUATE COURSE!

Tur Hegelian cycle with its thesis, antithesis and synthesis 
is well illustrated on a small scale by the history of the 
evolution of the American undergraduate course. It is 
now in its synthesis stage. Originally the college boy pur- 
sued a prescribed course which included large amounts of 
the classics and mathematics. In the latter part of the 
last century the antithesis came in the widespread adop- 
tion of the free elective principle which endeavored logically 
to recognize the doctrine of interest and operated practically 
to let the undergraduate try his hand at the art of self- 
direction. 
More recently we have witnessed serious, if not frantic, 
efforts to regain the values of the traditional course in 
liberal arts without ignoring the merits of the elective 
system. Mr. Charles E. Hughes has accused our colleges 
of “intellectual vagrancy.” His phrase characterizes ac- 
curately that mental quality of undergraduate study which 
recent tendencies in the organization of curricula have 
aimed to correct. Various mechanical devices have been 
invented. First of all came the “group systems.” By 
logical classifications of the fictitious departmental fields 
of knowledge and by general requirements controlling 
selections of courses it was assumed that the centrifugal 
forces set in operation by the elective plan could be 
counteracted. Either within or without the group system 
the plan for majors and minors was widely adopted. It

was imagined that this arrangement would correct the 
tendencies to scattering and smattering in which the col- 
lege student had become an adept. More recently even 
the college departments began to weaken under the weight 
of undue specialization. The student was bewildered. 
Fragments of knowledge were presented to him by a de- 
partmentalized faculty with no conscious endeavor on its 
part to unify or correlate the fields of knowledge. In the 
upper years of the course instructors discovered, much to 
their dismay, that the students had no common background 
to which more advanced work could be related. To meet 
the situation, general survey courses have appeared in some 
of our higher institutions. By this method it is expected 
that every student will acquire a certain modicum of in- 
formation, that he will secure at least a comprehensive, 
though superficial, view of the history of civilization and 
develop a tenable scientific point of view. 
The progress in scientific fields in recent decades has 
been the glory of higher education. Science has demon- 
strated what can be done in a university. The morale of 
the scientific world has been unprecedented and its achieve- 
ments are at once the shame and inspiration of scholarly 
endeavor in all fields. Just as the last half of the nine- 
teenth century saw scientific departments come into their 
own, so now we must anticipate a corresponding develop- 
ment in the social sciences. This tendency is already upon 
us. In the fields of political science, economics, anthro- 
pology and history we find everywhere evidence of clear 
insight into the tremendous issues of modern society and 
an understanding of the social order in its relation to world 
civilization. No doubt our social scientists dealing with 
inexact disciplines have been confronted by almost in- 
surmountable difficulties. Recent tendencies in American 
colleges, however, show a highly commendable emphasis 
upon this group of subjects and an effort to translate their
-P-A-G-E-27

conclusions into terms of individual and community life 
of a distinctly new and higher order.

But we are dealing with the mechanics of curricular or- 
ganization and not with the realities of education. It is 
perfectly clear, whatever may be the specific content of the 
best organized courses of study, that there are certain 
guiding principles emerging from recent practices and dis- 
cussions, which must be reckoned with in considering un- 
dergraduate work. Provision must be made for continuity 
between the secondary and higher units of our educational 
system and within the courses provided by either unit. 
The maladjustment between our high schools and uni- 
versities is accentuated by the tide of unfit students which 
constantly ebbs and flows in American education. The 
whole process is unfair to the student, the educator, and 
the public. 
Likewise some actual correlation of the widely diversified 
fields of knowledge is a sine qua non for intelligent and self- 
respecting work by the student. This cannot be done to 
order in correlation courses or general surveys of whole 
subjects. It must permeate the work of the entire course 
in all fields. At present the dazed undergraduate is sud- 
denly ushered into the gross anatomy laboratory of know- 
ledge and vigorous groups of specialists hurl at him the 
heart, lungs, and other vital organs of the body of know- 
ledge. He is then directed to fashion these disjecta mem- 
bra into a harmonious living organism. It cannot be done 
by this method. A heart functions only when it is a part 
of the body. Truth generates life only when seen as a 
part of that larger Something which gives meaning to all 
that is. 
The principles of continuity and correlation will make 
possible that concentration which suffered so terribly under

22 THE UNDERGRADUATE COURSE 
the attack of the elective system and which the classical 
course so successfully assured. Concentration requires 
something more than majors and minors. It does not 
come merely from prolonged study in this or that field. It 
is related to what we used to call “mental discipline.” It 
is not necessary to fly in the face of the psychologists. We 
are not contending for any specific content of study but 
for that quality born of severe, painstaking intellectual 
toil. It develops accuracy, which connotes carefulness, 
exactness and precision. It suggests “rigor and vigor,” 
and mental fibre that can take a strain. It is not solely a 
question of putting limits here and compulsions there but 
somehow giving the student a touch of the thrill of mental 
struggle. 
Do we need to speak of breadth of culture and liberality 
of mind? The modern undergraduate course has not failed 
at this point, unless we chide it for the faults of its virtues. 
It lacks in depth when compared with the old classical 
course, but it can scarcely be accused of narrowness of 
interest or servitude to conventional authority. Its rich- 
ness of offering, however, has produced a curious dearth of 
mental fecundity or rather has failed to develop minds 
springing and germinant with new life.

Modern America is very prone utterly to disregard the 
spiritual necessities of real education. We may tinker as 
long as we choose with entrance requirements, we may 
devise all kinds of examinations, group systems, survey 
courses and majors and minors but we shall quite miss the 
mark if we stop there. We may direct these recent tend- 
encies by the adoption of sound principles concretely ex- 
pressed in marvellously intricate curricular machinery 
without ever arousing a human being. Education is a 
spiritual process and given certain inner realities our super-
-P-A-G-E-29

ficial problems may be easily met. If only we have a 
student with that irresistible inner compulsion for the 
things of the mind which beats down every obstacle we 
need have no further concern. And as strange and rare as 
such a specimen may seem, he does still exist. Not even 
the diffusing amusements of to-day can ruin such a spirit. 
Now and then there is born a person who instinctively 
knows the worth of ideas and who is fascinated by the 
values of literature, art and science. Even colleges and 
universities cannot smother such as these and in some 
places of learning their hunger and thirst are satisfied. 
But the real problem in undergraduate work to-day is the 
social status of the scholarly student. In numberless cases 
the spark of intellectuality is promptly stamped out by 
that tyrant of every campus — student tradition. A 
student who studies is queer! Few men or women have 
such devotion to inner promptings that they are willing 
to be accused of bad form. To be a high-brow is fatal 
to campus recognition. Every sane person is naturally 
highly sensitive to the judgment of his own colleagues. So 
long as students, either as a pose or actually, take the at- 
titude that intellectual merit is not among the highest 
values of college life, we are not liable to accomplish much 
by our complicated organization of curricula or by the 
promulgation of epistemological theories. The issue is: 
Can it be brought about in American colleges that social 
prestige attaches to the man who achieves intellectual dis- 
tinction? 
How stupid we are and how persistently we proceed to 
ignore our commonly accepted conclusions about educa- 
tion! We all know that it is an active affair. College 
students to-day are unusually susceptible to the impact of 
a vigorous personality. Fortunately American colleges 
and universities are placing a higher value upon the stimu- 
lating teacher. Mere lecturing is being replaced in under-

graduate work by vigorous pertinent discussions. A de 
mocracy must learn, both in formal and informal ways, to 
secure the benefits arising when mind meets mind in virile 
argument. Education begins when the student develops 
an active mind. 
Education is an inner affair. Multitudes imagine they 
want an education because they infer that thereby they 
will acquire sharper implements for the economic struggle. 
University students in larger numbers treat their educa- 
tion just as they do a suit of clothes. It is an external 
thing. They can put it on or off as convention dictates. 
They want to use it without being it. The typical student 
dreads terribly the thought of being considered a high-brow 
or different from the man of the street. That education is 
to alter his tastes, deepen his sense of values, revise his 
standards, sharpen his appreciation of the truth, and 
quicken his sense of oughtness does not enhance its at- 
tractiveness. Education, even in the undergraduate world, 
tests as if by fire the very mettle of aman. It deals with 
his inner being. It commands him to put on, not as a 
garment, a new mind divested of all the ignorance, pre- 
judice and superstition of earlier days and committed to 
the fearless quest of the truth regardless of the conse- 
quences to himself or his own personal interests. The 
spiritual necessities of education can only be supplied by 
our colleges and universities when in American homes, in 
business offices and in the political world some serious re- 
gard is paid to the things of the mind. Our undergraduate 
work to-day is the condemning reflection of the sense of 
values accepted by even the more prosperous, and possibly 
discriminating, class of American citizens who appear to 
believe in higher education.

CULTURE AND PROFESSIONALISM IN 
EDUCATION ! 
JOHN DEWEY 
In education as in sport the amateur has always had a 
higher ranking than the professional, even when the latter 
had greater skill and won more successes. There may be 
some snobbery mingled with this state of affairs, but in the 
main it is due to the idea that the amateur cares for the 
thing itself and pursues it, whether golf or learning, from 
love of the activity, while with the professional the activity, 
whether science or a game, is subservient to pecuniary re- 
wards and other external consequences. It is not sur- 
prising accordingly that large numbers of persons are 
deeply concerned about present tendencies in education, 
especially in the higher schools, for they seem to see every- 
where an irresisted movement to professionalize teaching 
and learning. The amateur of learning hardly seems to be 
holding his own as well as the amateur in sport. 
It is not hard to make out a case. Disinterested love of 
inquiry and idealistic devotion to the things of the mind in 
science and art are not flourishing in our high schools, col- 
leges and universities as are the studies that prepare for 
what is called practical life. The campus of almost every 
large educational institution in the country presents to the 
observer professional schools of business or commerce, of 
teaching and of journalism added to the traditional schools 
of law, theology and medicine, while the branches of tech- 
nical study in engineering and agriculture have been in- 
definitely multiplied. Many colleges have a large part of

  26 CULTURE AND PROFESSIONALISM 
their undergraduate work so arranged as to overlap work 
in the professional schools so that they are in effect pro- 
fessional preparatory schools. Hence there is a lively 
solicitude as to whether our higher schools are going to 
surrender to the practical and industrial spirit of the age, 
until that discriminating love of thought and its products 
that we call culture shall have been buried under modes of 
training that prepare students for their future vocations. 
I, for one, should not wish to deny that there are de- 
plorable features in the present situation and dangers for 
the future. I think, however, that a consideration of its 
causes is more helpful than lamentation and scolding. In 
the main, these causes seem to be twofold. In the past, 
liberal studies and culture were the almost exclusive pos- 
session of a leisure class. For the leisure class was in 
general control of political affairs and through the re- 
sponsibilities and contacts of social management secured a 
wide horizon and a serious and dignified outlook on life. 
Moreover, the social status of the members of this leisure 
class was hereditary, so that there was opportunity for the 
development of a continuous and cumulative tradition of 
taste and interest. The masses of the people were occupied 
as they always have been with getting their daily living. 
They had no part in the direction of society; they were not 
consulted in political affairs, domestic or foreign. Their 
interests were confined to their own parish and door-yard, 
and they naturally had no share in any education except 
the most elementary practical and vocational apprentice- 
ship. 
At the present time there is no social class predestined 
to play the major réle in politics and in social management. 
Actual control has passed largely into the hands of practi- 
cal businessmen, but this class is not a closed class but is 
ever changing its personnel with the ups and downs of 
economic fortune. The masses have been politically
-P-A-G-E-33
  JOHN DEWEY 27 
emancipated and in theory at least share in the control of 
society and the state. They have free time and material 
resources as their forefathers had not; they have access to 
cheap and varied reading matter. In consequence of this 
great social revolution, the leisure class, with which the 
whole tradition of culture and education in the past was 
bound up, tends to disappear or to become a merely idle 
class. Its representatives in our higher schools do not go 
in for professionalism but neither do they go in for culture; 
they are devoted to luxury and sport. And in comparison 
with the nominal concern of this class for the traditional 
liberal studies, and their actual lack of any intellectual 
interests, the assiduity and seriousness of students with 
professional aims stands out in a refreshing way. Large 
numbers who had neither opportunity, money nor motive 
for getting a higher education in the past now have the 
chance, the means and good hope of improving their 
careers by getting an education. The tradition behind 
them being by force of necessity that of industrial endeavor 
and achievement, it is natural that the same standards 
should persist for a generation or two at least. It is thus 
not practical or vocational education which is new; that 
has always been the only education received by the great 
mass of mankind. What is new is the opportunity to get 
this education somewhere else than in the home or shop 
and in some other manner than by indenture and by im- 
itation of associates. 
The rapid growth of professional tendencies and aims in 
higher education appears then to be the effect of the social 
and economic changes of the last century and a half. No 
such political and industrial dislocation could possibly 
occur without a great educational change. The decline of 
the traditional leisure class has given a shock to the studies 
and intellectual interests associated with it. The economic 
and political elevation of the masses has intensified the
-P-A-G-E-34
28 CULTURE AND PROFESSIONALISM 
studies and interests which have been in the past the pre- 
occupation of the masses while it has also afforded facilities 
for realizing their practical ambitions. 
Even if it could be proved that the present movement 
toward professionalism in education were historically in- 
evitable, it would not follow that it is wholly desirable or 
admirable. But the placing of the movement in its his- 
toric setting shows that if there has been loss on one side 
there has been gain on the other. Large numbers of stu- 
dents may not be getting the most ideal education, but at 
all events they are getting some scientific training and in- 
tellectual outlook, while their ancestors only a few genera- 
tions ago were not getting any higher schooling at all, and 
not much lower instruction. It is even possible that it is 
only in ratio that professional have gained so much upon 
liberal studies and that in absolute amount the latter have 
not appreciably lost. 
But the chief value of the historic interpretation is, it 
seems to me, the ground it gives for believing, with some 
reasonable confidence, that present tendencies are transi- 
tory since they are the expression of a very rapid and recent 
social transition. It is natural, as was said, that new- 
comers to an intellectual and liberal tradition should bring 
with them their own old tradition. Since by necessity and 
through no fault of their own their background is mainly 
that of getting a secure livelihood and obtaining success in 
a career, why should not this aim be projected by them into 
education when they get a chance at it? Meantime there 
is some contact with intellectual pursuits and aims, some 
degree of reshaping of thought and purpose; and it may 
well be that a new and much more widely and solidly 
established tradition of culture is in process of develop- 
ment. The great universities of the middle ages in Europe 
were groups of professional schools, and yet it can not be 
doubted that they were largely the authors of the free ar-
-P-A-G-E-35
  JOHN DEWEY “ago 
tistic and intellectual movement that we call the Renais- 
sance. 
After all, the friends of liberal and so-called cultural 
studies are somewhat to blame for the existing state of 
affairs which they deplore. They have often made a cult 
out of culture, and treated it as a sacred and highly pro- 
tected industry. Our ultimate faith must be in the in- 
trinsic appeal which things of the mind make to the human 
mind when the mind is brought in contact with them. An 
imagination sensitive to things of intellectual value and a 
power of discriminating choice among the values that sur- 
roundings offer are the chief marks of the cultivated mind. 
Even if, at first, these traits are only secondary accom- 
paniments of pursuit of knowledge and mental discipline 
for the sake of professional ends, yet if they are as worthy 
and delightful as we friends of culture think they are, even 
incidental acquaintance with them ought to breed a more 
whole-hearted interest and devotion, till from the training 
of the professional there emerges the person who has all the 
interests of the amateur combined with the seriousness and 
trained skill of the professional. 
I do not believe, however, that we should sit idly by and 
wait passively for this hope of a future transformation of 
professional tendencies to be realized. There are things 
that can be done to facilitate and hasten the process. I 
hesitate to call culture a by-product because the word 
might seem to insinuate that it is unimportant. But 
culture is not a specific and direct aim. As moralists have 
said that happiness is best attained by not aiming directly 
at it but by devotion to things that bring happiness in their 
train, so itis with culture. It is a fruit and reward of other 
activities. There is nothing in the subject-matter or 
method of professional studies that prevents them having 
this fruitage. It is a question after all of the spirit in 
which they are carried on. A school of law, medicine, 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
30 CULTURE AND PROFESSIONALISM 
engineering or theology that teaches only enough science 
to be a directly practical tool and teaches it only as a sub- 
ordinate tool or device and not for the sake of insight into 
its principles will not be favorable to culture. But that is 
the fault of the spirit of the teaching and learning, not of 
the subjects taught or of the fact that useful application 
is ultimately to be made of the things learned. In other 
words, the more the scientific spirit of inquiry and love of 
thinking is introduced into professional teaching, the surer 
is broad and liberal intellectual interest and taste to be the 
product. 
Again, while professional studies have to be conducted 
with ultimate application in practice in view, this applica- 
tion may be to personal success, pecuniary and competi- 
tive, or it may be more widely social. There is a great 
difference in the attitude, for example, of the engineer who 
looks upon his special training as a means to the material 
success of himself or his employer, and the one who also 
sees in it a means of solving some of the most acute social 
problems of the present.. In the degree in which the broad 
human factor enters in, culture is a consequence. 
I think our friends in the professional schools will not 
take offense if we say that many of us who are engaged in 
non-professional fields of inquiry and teaching often feel 
some misgivings at present tendencies, and wonder whether 
because of these tendencies consideration of philosophy 
and history, and the natural and social sciences is going to 
suffer. Fundamentally we are coworkers. The more 
theoretical studies do not attain their highest development 
until they find some application in human life, contributing 
indirectly at least to human freedom and wellbeing, while 
the more practical studies can not reach their highest 
practicality save as they are animated by a disinterested 
spirit of inquiry. At present the current sets your way 
rather than ours, and time it did, you may think, in view
-P-A-G-E-37

of so much of the past of educational history. But in our 
common interest, we may ask that we join together to 
foster in any and every department of the university, 
interest in inquiry and liberal discussion and love of 
scientific thinking, that is of free and disinterested think- 
ing. When all teaching whether labelled primarily liberal 
or professional has this love as its goal, we shall develop in 
our schools what may be called the amateur professional: 
the man and woman who unites the seriousness, unity of 
purpose and skill of the professional with the breadth and 
freedom of thought and desire characteristic of the ama- 
teur.

’ STUDENT ACTIVITIES IN THE COLLEGE! 
ALEXANDER MEIKLEJOHN 
’ To begin, then, I am convinced, as I write this paper, that 
in any ideal college, student activities are of fundamental 
importance and that anyone who would cook up a college 
without them need hope to find little appreciation of his 
wares. I can say this with freedom and irresponsibility 
to-day because mirie is not the task of selecting or com- 
pounding the elements. I have an article to sell and I will 
sing its praises long and loud. It is for the cook to decide 
whether or not he will have it in the dish and if he takes it 
in, you give it proper mingling with the other stuffs which 
other vendors have brought in. 
The name “student activities” is intended, I presume, 
to express a difference or contrast. The name marks them 
off from the studies, those elements of college life which, 
by implication, are either not student’s affairs or not ac- 
tivities. I fear that our teachers in the colleges do not like 
the implication. We do not like to have studies regarded 
as peculiarly belonging to the Faculty, nor on the other 
hand, do we wish them degraded to the realm of the mere 
passivities. And so the very name itself arouses antag- 
onism. It suggests that here is a feature of college life 
which doés not mix very smoothly with the others. It is 
not a good label if one would recommend his wares to col- 
lege teachers who are eagerly striving to tempt the in- 
tellectual appetites of the boys intrusted to their charge. 
If we are to include under the phrase “student activities 
apart from athletics” such enterprises as debating, dra-

faculty point of view concerning them in the words, “‘The 
less said about them the better.” 
And with that judgment, properly interpreted, I am in- 
clined to agree. But I should personally not intend to 
minimize them. It is not a safe generalization to declare 
that phases of human life are important in direct ratio to 
the degree to which they are publicly talked about. It is 
rather assumed amongst us that many elemental and sig- 
nificant features of our common life are not to be talked 
about at all — they are to be taken for granted, to be ac- 
cepted as given in the very nature of things. And it is just 
this “givenness,” this inevitableness of “student activi- 
ties” which should first of all be recognized as we approach 
them. We choose to bring boys together into social groups 
in order that we may teach them, may train their minds, 
may furnish them with information. But it is an inevit- 
able incident of such a process that the boys should find 
themselves together and should at once engage in common 
activities which seem to them attractive and at least 
entertaining. We keep them busy or try to do so five or six 
or seven hours a day; with due allowance for the separa- 
tion of sleep, they have many more hours than these to 
spend together in enterprises of their own choosing. We 
did not bring them together for the sake of these activities, 
but from our bringing them together, these ‘ activities 
follow. They are, as it were, a necessary accident of the 
teaching process. Whether we will or not, there they are 
and there they will remain in some form or other so long as 
boys are brought together in the common life of a college 
campus. And yet, in the presence of these inevitable ac- 
cidents of our central purpose many of our teachers grudg- 
ingly acknowledge their presence, Wut, resenting it, they

say, “Let them alone, the less said about them the better.” 
Naw if their attitude were not born in resentment, [ 
should find it very congenial. The conclusion which it 
states seems to be excellent, even though the reasoning 
which leads to it is atrocious. The truth is that we talk 
too much about student activities, meddle with them too 
much, and legisiate about them too much. And I say this 
not because they are bad, but because they are too good 
to be spoiled by our clumsy interferences; not because I 
am opposed to them, but because I should like to see them 
freely develop and grow as the spontaneous activities of 
the boys whose growth and development is our chief con- 
cern. To tamper with them seems to be like tampering 
with one’s comptékion. In one sphere at least we are sure 
that the improvement of the general health gives better 
permarient results for the complexion than temporary 
tampering, however satisfying for the moment. My im- 
pression is that the same principle holds good in the beauti- 
fication of colleges; make them strong and healthy and the 
activities will take care of themselves. 
But whether our ignoring of student activities be due to 
hatred or to love, there are times when even the most 
abstract teacher is startled into recognition of them. Last 
Sunday evening I heard the Dean of one of our great law 
schools tell about the work of his school. And almost his 
first remark was, “You will not find any activities at the 
law school; we give a man enough to do for all the time he 
can give to activities.” And with his words, there flashed 
across my mind the vision of a liberal college without out- 
side activities. What would it be like to teach liberal 
studies to a group of students who should give all their 
time to their studies, whose work should be their play, 
whose time should be wholly at our command? I think I 
have still enough of the spirit of the teacher to thrill at that 
vision. But as I saw it and reflected on it, there came to
-P-A-G-E-41
    
ALEXANDER MEIKLEJOHN 35 
mind those terrible words of Newman in which he. con- 
trasts the little we can do for the student with the much 
that he can do for himself. 
“JT protest to you, gentlemen, that if I had to choose 
between a so-called university, which dispensed with 
residence and tutorial superintendence, and gave its de- 
grees to any person who passed any examination in a wide 
range of subjects, and a university which had no professors 
or examinations at all but merely brought a number of 
young men together for three or four years, and then sent 
them away, as the University of Oxford is said to have 
done some sixty years since, if I were asked which of these 
two methods was the better discipline of the intellect: — 
mind, I do not say which is morally ti better, for it is 
plain that compulsory study must be a good and idleness an 
intolerable mischief, — but if I may determine Which of 
the two courses was the more successful in training, mould- 
ing, enlarging the mind, which sent out men the more 
fitted for their secular duties, which produced better public 
men, men of the world, men whose names would descend 
to posterity, I have no hesitation in giving the preference 
to that university which did nothing over that which ex- 
acted of its members an acquaintance with every science 
under the sun. s 
“How is this to’be explained? I suppose as follows: 
when a multitude, keen, open-hearted, sympathetic, and 
observant as young men are, come together and freely mix 
with one another, they are sure to learn from one another, 
even if there be no one to teach them; the conversation of 
all is a series of lectures to each, and they gain for them- 
selves new ideas and views, fresh matter of thought, and 
distinct principles for judging and acting, day by day.” 
Now with these words of Newman ringing in our ears, 
let us state and answer a fair question, “Would you, if you 
could, free an undergraduate college from its activities?”
-P-A-G-E-42
  36 STUDENT ACTIVITIES IN THE COLLEGE 
My own answer is flatly in the negative. I believe that 
whatever a liberal college may be with them, without them 
it would be a sorry place in which to live. And for this 
conclusion there are at least two reasons. First, I am con- 
vinced-that the complete absorption of the student in his 
studies would not in most cases give the best kind of col- 
lege training. Not only are we trying to give college boys 
acquaintance with a great body of knowledge; more im- 
portant than this, they: must also acquire understanding, 
interpretation of what they are learning, reconstruction of 
what they have known. And for this process there is need 
of leisure, of ‘deliberation and contemplation, of a certain 
quiet waiting for subconscious processes to do their part. 
These results cannot be achieved merely by digging and 
grinding. In addition to the work there must be the 
leisure;:the two must be combined if the fruits of culture 
and intelligence are to be reached. ‘Again, if we view 
college life fairly, we dare not fail to take account of the 
constantly repeated statement of graduates that they 
count certain “activities” as having been of far greater 
educational value than the studies given and taken in the 
classroom, I am sure that this statement contains more 
of falsity than of truth. But there is a truth in it and it be- 
hooves us to isolate it andslook it fairly in the face. As I 
look back on the old experience of teaching and disciplin- 
ing, I seem to’see what these graduates mean. I see it most 
clearly when I try to single out from the lopg line of stu- 
dents some one group which shall stand forth as intel- 
lectually the best — best in college work and best in pro- 
mise of future intellectual achievement. Much as I should 
like to do so, I cannot draw the line around my own favorite 
students in philosophy, nor the leaders in. mathematics, 
nor those successful in biology, nor could I fairly award the 
palm to the Phi Beta Kappa men who have excelled in all 
their subjects. _ It seems to me that stronger than any
-P-A-G-E-43
ALEXANDER MEIKLEJOHN 387 
other group, tougher in intellectual fibre, keener in in- 
tellectual interest, better equipped to battle with coming 
problems, are the college debaters — the boys who, apart 
from their regular studies, band themselves together for 
intellectual controversy with each other and with their 
friends in other colleges. JT.am not concerned to argue here 
the pros and cons of intercollegiate debate. It has its de- 
fects as well as its virtues, but if it be true that in this 
activity many of our-best minds find their most congenial 
occupation and are furthered in intellectual growth, rather 
than hindered in it, here is a challenge which we cannot 
fail to meet in the administration of college life and study. 
And in some measure, though in different forms, what is 
true of debating holds true of dramatics, of writing, of 
music, and the other activities. When boys form their 
clubs or “crowds” for the spontaneous, enthusiastic pur- 
suit of some chosen ideal, they gain from it a power, a live- 
liness of interest which can never be gained where that 
spontaneity is lacking. ‘ 
But now I shall be asked: Would you substitute these 
activities for the studies — give up the classroom for the 
lounging room and the Union? Of course not. The very 
excellence of ‘these activities is that fundamentally they 
are the fruits of the classroom.’ But the point is that by 
these fruits the work of the classroom shall be known. We 
need not forget that these activities are only accidental 
and that the rgal values lie in the studies and the teaching. 
But none the less, it is true that these activities reveal to us, 
far better than any examinations can do, the success or 
failure of the classroom itself. They are, as it were, mir- 
rors in which we can see ourselves and our work. If we 
want to know the effects of what we are doing in the class- 
room, let us.look to see what the students are.doing out- 
side of it, when they are free to follow their own desires. If 
they do not, on their own initiative carry on activities
-P-A-G-E-44
  38 STUDENT ACTIVITIES IN THE COLLEGE 
springing out of their studies, then you may count on it 
that however well the tests are met, the studies are of little 
value. Show mea college in which literature is taught, but 
in which the boys do not band together to read and write 
and criticise, in which they do not yearn to be themselves 
“literary.” However well literature may be taught in that 
college, it is not well learned. What would you say of the 
teaching of philosophy which did not send boys off into 
quarrelling, puzzling groups, determined each to give to 
his fellows the solutions of the problems that have baffled 
human thinking? What will you say of the teaching of 
history, economics, or social science which ends in the pas- 
sive appropriation of a book? Surely if it is vital, you will 
find the young men stimulated by it eagerly reforming and 
reshaping in idea the society about them, and perhaps 
going out to do some work to bring their ideals to fulfill- 
ment. And if in these and other cases it does appear that 
the studies in the classroom have no outside effect, lead to 
no outside activities, what expectation can you have that 
they will lead to activity after the college days are done? 
If studies do not stimulate to spontaneous, free outside 
activities, if they are the learning of lessons and giving 
them back, then the results of our training are typically 
small; we may send out good, well-meaning boys, who will 
do what they are told, and refrain from doing anything 
else, but we shall not send out men of intellectual power 
and grip who are able to learn for themselves the life which 
the intellect opens before them.

  THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE? 
JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 
Our of the American vision of what men are and what 
they may become, evolve all the fundamental expressions 
of American life; instinctively, for the most part; and so, 
subject to the deviousness of an experience forever cor- 
recting itself; but which, correcting itself in quite definite 
ways, reveals that the vision which is the soul of its mean- 
ing is ever present. 
What are some of these expressions of American life? 
And how shall the American college adjust itself to them? 
First, there is the American state. The state is one of 
many expressions of the American order and exists to 
guarantee its sure success. All the significant things that 
belong to political America as an ideal are already implied 
in America’s interpretation of the nature of men and their 
rights. Thus, the freedom and equality that we have 
found belonging to the American theory of the person 
translate themselves, politically, into self-government, with 
its freedom and equality of thought, speech, and ballot; 
and of civil and political rights. This self-government be- 
comes a government through elected representatives for 
only one reason, — it is impracticable for each one of the 
great democracy to govern directly. 
In such a government, the functions of the representa- 
tive are two: To express the people’s will; and to lead it in 
the light of his unusual opportunities for information and 
wisdom in matters of public concern. On the other hand, 
_ the functions of the citizen are to acquaint himself with

    40 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
the issues that constantly arise for his decision; to express 
and to discuss his convictions freely with his fellows; and 
freely and fearlessly to register his convictions through the 
franchise, — in other words, to realize his rational freedom 
through a thoroughly conscious political responsibility. 
If we scan American politics as it actually is, we find that 
the citizen has failed and that his representative has failed 
quite notoriously; and in ways in which the American col- 
lege ought to be conspicuously equipped to remedy. The 
failure of both the citizen and his representative is, first of 
all, in the lack of expert intelligence in matters political; 
both tending to substitute for political wisdom an opti- 
mistic fatalism which is convinced that no possible error 
could ever render American democracy anything but 
triumphant. Add to this our characteristically American 
belief, noted the world over, that anybody can do anything, 
particularly the deeds involved in all phases of governing. 
Such faith is fatal. The college can correct it. Pre- 
cisely here is where the limited but important ideal of 
“education for citizenship,” finds an indispensable place. 
A course in the American State, including intelligent dis- 
cussion of vital political problems — yes, and comparative 
government — should be required of every American col- 
lege man. And in all this, the institution of American 
government should not be left unrelated to the larger as- 
pects of the American social order, whose security and 
progress is its only justification. 
The American college can help America to redeem a sec- 
ond noteworthy failure of both its citizens and politicians; 
namely, the failure to realize government as a social re- 
sponsibility, before which every whit of selfishness must 
give way. The indifference of the citizen to the franchise; 
his submission to the intrenched power of the Bosses; his 
regarding his government as a far-away thing, somehow 
abstracted from his private and local concerns — these all 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 41 
are facts; and they are symptoms of an apathy which 
plays directly into the hands of the politician, who, selfish 
in his own way, makes of the citizen’s indifference his own 
opportunity; abuses his function as a representative and 
ignores his responsibilities as a leader; or deliberately takes 
advantage of his inside knowledge to mislead. The col- 
lege can remedy this, too, and in only one way. It can 
remedy it by making its entire curriculum and its adminis- 
tration a training for the feeling and the conviction of re- 
sponsibility to the social order, including its political insti- 
tution — a moral responsibility, conceived as the supreme 
business of the educated man; not as a mere incident 
among the things worth while. With the American social 
order as the aim of education, the American state at once 
becomes an integral part of that living purpose, in terms 
of which college education shall exist. One of the most en- 
couraging signs for the future of the American state is the 
increasing emergence of college men into expert leadership 
in political life> Education in America may yet be, in fact 
as well as in theory, what our forefathers wanted it to be, 
the bulwark of democratic government. 
Second, the American order is an economic and industrial 
order. If, in the American conception, all things must 
serve the person as the ultimate end and criterion. of 
values, so must all economic institutions. Verily, there is 
such a thing as economic and industrial democracy —as an 
ideal. What such economic democracy in detail would be 
is one of the grave questions for the educated man to solve, 
and to solve speedily. The question is, certainly, immi- 
nent and imperative enough. It is going to be answered 
in one way or another; quite possibly, in the wrong way. 
The risk is that the more pressing economic and industrial 
questions may be decided in one of two equally disastrous 
ways; either by the one-sided prejudices of the wage- 
earner, through a growing self-conscious solidarity, which   
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
means dictatorship, with or without violence; or, by the 
equally one-sided prejudices of the wage-payer, through 
the adroit manipulation of the established order, for which 
he has some genius. Or, a third way is possible — con- 
tinuous compromises, out of which shall emerge again and 
yet again the everlasting conflict, to be compromised once 
more. 
The solution of the economic problems of the American 
order cannot rightly come through the triumph of the 
interests of one class, or through the compromise of classes. 
Such solutions are contradictions to the very being of the 
American order. Virtually, they make large bodies of men 
things to be used, not ends in themselves. Such solutions 
mean the exploitation of the employer by the employee; or 
the reverse; or both. No, the economic problem must be 
solved, painfully and slowly as you please, not by pre- 
judice or by special interests on the one side or the other; 
but by an impartial and expert reason, whose supreme 
qualification is the possession of a standard of values higher 
than the merely economic; and expressive of the many- 
sided good of the social order as a whole. Never and no- 
where was rational and judicious leadership through cour- 
ageous convictions needed more than now and here. It is 
the business of the college to furnish much of the material 
for such leadership, if the college be granted to exist for 
the social order at all. \And the American college must 
afford not only leaders, but a large body of men who can 
intelligently support intelligent leadership, once it appears. 
Certainly, every American college man should have a 
training in economic and industrial fundamentals. But it 
must not be an economics academically taught. It must 
mean a learning to think in economic terms, based upon a 
conviction of the gravity of the economic situation, and 
stimulated by a sympathetic knowledge of comparative 
points of view and of contemporary movements of eco-
-P-A-G-E-49
  JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 43 
nomic import. America and the world-seethe with such 
movements now; the college graduate must meet them not 
indifferently or ignorantly, but responsibly and _intel- 
ligently — which means a fundamental recognition of the 
relation of economic values to the other human values for 
which his college exists. Once there was a danger that 
some colleges might find themselves indirectly subsidized, 
to the exclusion of open-mindedness in economic teaching. 
But this danger has been minimized as the academic free- 
dom and tenure of the college professor have become more 
and more secure. Nor may it be forgotten that, added to 
the direct influence of the college, is the indirect influence 
of the technical schools of our universities, which yearly 
send into the world of economic and industrial life trained 
experts, many of whom have taken part of the college 
course; including, it is to be hoped, some such training in 
economic thinking as I have urged. The indirect influence 
of such men, trained broadly, even if superficially, in 
economic questions would be invaluable. 
Third, the American order means a new conception of 
social groupings. Most obviously, the social theory of our 
democracy makes a system of castes or of semi-castes im- 
possible. That is, there can be no group whose existence 
means the possession of valuable and exclusive privileges 
for personal advantage over their fellows, and which is not 
founded upon principles of inclusion for which any person 
as a person may qualify, in time. Thus, there can be no 
aristocracy in the European sense, based upon such a for- 
bidding barrier as that of birth. And this has sometimes 
been urged against American democratic society as a de- 
fect. Indeed, the innate monotony, the social dead level, 
the spiritless and uninteresting uniformity of democratic 
society (as a theory) often has been enlarged upon. We 
are told that the doctrine of social equality inevitably 
carries with jt social sameness.  
-P-A-G-E-50
44 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
But the criticism of democracy’s society as monotonously 
uniform assumes that the equality of democracy prohibits 
the institution of social groups of different grades, mutually 
exclusive in any sense. Yet not all social groups are 
castes. And there may be, indeed, a highest social group, 
without its constituting itself an aristocracy. 
For, remember that the doctrine of equality means that 
persons’ are equals as ends — as possibilities — and that 
they have freedom — the freedom to seek their self- 
realization in the social goal, through the reason of each. 
This social goal, this ideal democracy, is theoretically and 
really the same for all. But while all have the same ideal; 
and while, thus, and only thus, is the solidarity of de- 
mocracy secured, not every person is in the same stage of 
progress toward it. Nor have those in the same stage the 
same individual problems to meet — the same interests. 
Men are, indeed, the same in so far as their ideal is the 
same, and in so far as they have equal opportunities for 
attaining it. But men are different in so far as they repre- 
sent different cultural stages toward the ideal, and express 
their individuality by realizing it in their own ways. 
Now, men will naturally and reasonably group them- 
selves according to their fundamental “‘interest,” as we say. 
And the fundamental interest of democracy’s man, apart 
from the universally shared interest in the common demo- 
cratic ideal, is his interest in those things which appertain 
to his own stage of self-realization toward the social goal. 
The true principle of fundamental groups in a democracy, 
then, is community in a stage of culture, or of progress 
toward the common social ideal. This has reference to 
democracy’s fundamental groups. They are formed on an 
ethical principle; for democracy is an essentially ethical 
conception. Other social groups may be formed upon 
more superficial bases; but they are not integral parts of 
the organization of democracy’s society, as such. And
-P-A-G-E-51
  JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 45 
they must disappear if, in principle, they are opposed 
to it. 
These social groups of ideal democracy are exclusive in 
the sense that no one is acceptable to a group unless he ful- 
fills in himself the qualifications that belong to the sort of 
culture which it represents. These social groups are open 
to all in the sense that any person has within himself the 
capacity for attaining any given stage of culture, and so 
any social group whatever. Thus, no group of democracy 
can become a fixed aristocracy. One may add that no 
sane man would want to belong to an association of persons 
whose cultural attainments and interests were widely 
different from his own. 
Further, the spirit of democracy permits no snobbishness 
on the part of any of its social groups. A social set might 
well be formed in strict accord with democracy’s principles, 
and yet not truly represent democracy, if its members 
looked upon persons of less cultural attainment with the 
Pharisee’s thanksgiving. For, in democracy, the social 
ideal of the member of a restricted group is the good not 
only of his kind, but of the whole of society. Should he 
restrict his aim to those of his own sort, he thereby would 
turn his back upon democracy and join his fortunes with 
an abortive aristocracy. If the masses are not as high as 
he in cultural progress, he will not look down upon them 
with contempt, or pity, or indifference; his aim, even in his 
restricted associations, is to put the masses in the way of 
progress, not as charity, but as social justice. Thus, the 
members of a truly democratic social set are not exclusive, 
in the sense that they limit all their social recognitions to 
their kind alone. They esteem themselves part of the 
larger suciety, whose obligations are forever prior; and for 
whose obligations, indeed, they are formed into a group 
the better to discharge. 
What can the college do to mold American social sets
-P-A-G-E-52
    46 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
into an approximation to America’s meaning of a social 
order? 
Well, first of all, it can attempt to correct the obvious 
shortcomings of American social sets as they exist. Best 
of all, it can do this by correcting these same short- 
comings within the society of the college itself. What are 
these defects that must be minimized within the student’s 
world, for the sake of that later world he is to enter? To 
put it boldly, how do American social sets, as they are, sin 
against democracy? 
They sin against democracy in so far as they do not try 
to discover their real relation to the social order as a whole, 
and are not fully loyal to what they do know. 
They sin against democracy in so far as they emphasize 
exclusiveness for its own sake; an emphasis that is aided 
and abetted by the inherent and imitative snobbishness 
of the masses. 
They sin against democracy in so far as they emphasize 
principles of inclusion which are impossible for a person as 
a person; such as great wealth beyond its cultural worth, 
and in terms of the unjust deprivation of others. 
They sin against democracy in so far as their ideal is the 
welfare of the restricted group, rather than that of the 
total society of which they are parts; and in so far as they 
do not make the obligations of this larger society strictly 
prior, and are not grouped for the sake of service to it, 
rather than for selfish glorification. 
They sin against democracy in so far as they regard 
themselves, isolated and apart, as the real Society, over 
against the masses, who are conceived as socially alien. 
In a democracy, there should be no Society, in the in- 
sidious meaning of Society versus the masses. Any per- 
son belongs to some social group; each group, however 
large or small, however little it may mingle with others, 
being rightly considered an integral part of that larger 
society which, alone, is democracy.
-P-A-G-E-53
  JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 47 
And, finally, our hedonistic social sets sin especially 
against democracy in so far as they tend to become egoistic 
and unscrupulously, narrowly, self-indulgent; and, there- 
fore, deeply unsocial, and so undemocratic. 
Thus, through these sins against democracy, the condi- 
tions of genuine social progress are yet far from being ful- 
filled in America. For, again, the democratic ideal of 
society came into being and is justified only because, as far 
as human reason and experience can judge, this conception 
is the only one that secures an indefinite and complete 
social progress — a progress which is ethically real. Amer- 
ica has adopted democracy; but society, at least in the re- 
stricted sense, is not quite loyal to America’s cherished 
hope. 
This hope may be realized partially within college walls. 
The defects of the American social sets must here be cor- 
rected as much as is practicable, whether expressed in snob- 
bishness of family, or wealth, or display, or intellect; 
whether through hedonism, or aimlessness; whether in- 
corporated in social cliques, or in such forms of fraternities 
and sororities and clubs as defy the American idea. Here 
in the college, if anywhere, should be found at least a re- 
mote suggestion of the true social ranking. But it can 
exist only if the consciousness of the American social order, 
and the meaning of its persons, are introduced to the 
students’ minds fot only as a theory, but as an atmosphere. 
It is Utopian to expect too much from the colleges in this 
respect. But it is not Utopian to hope and demand some- 
thing. Above all, no college should lend itself, as some 
few “aristocratic” colleges certainly have, to the perpetua- 
tion of those very social distinctions which the American 
college should exist emphatically to discourage. 
Fourth, the American social order has its unmistakable 
implications in the realm of literature and the other arts. 
A famous musician said, during the World War: “It is
-P-A-G-E-54
  48 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
my conviction that art has as much at stake in this war as 
democracy.” His reason was that true art depends upon 
true democracy for its future. Since literature is the art 
most familiar to us, and since it ranks high among the arts, 
we may allow it to be representative of the arts for the 
purposes of this discussion. 
Now, that there is possible an art distinctively American 
has been challenged for a number of reasons; reasons which, 
I think, are answerable. In the first place, it is alleged 
that we are guilty of the fallacy of False Cause if we sup- 
pose that a particular form of government has any direct 
influence upon art. But the question is not whether de- 
mocracy, in the restricted sense of democratic government, 
has any influence upon art; but whether democracy, as a 
theory of man and society, exemplified in a total national 
life, has such influence. 
Second, it is argued that America has not yet attained a 
national unity. To this one may reply that America is 
rapidly attaining a unified self-consciousness, so far as 
many of the fundamental meanings of its democracy are 
concerned; that the war has helped to render this unity 
still more real; and that even if a national unity were not 
yet attained, it is a possibility; and that art should do its 
unique share to realize it. 
Third, it is contended that the modern close intercourse 
of nations tends towards the obliteration of purely national 
arts. But the intimate interrelations of peoples cannot 
obliterate the distinctiveness of America, until all peoples 
adopt the principles of its social order. And, even then, 
the distinctiveness of America will richly remain in the 
uniqueness of the content of that order; a content to which 
I shall presently refer. 
Finally, it is urged that true art is universal in its nature; 
it transcends national boundaries, just as true logic is the 
same logic, regardless of places and times. The answer is
-P-A-G-E-55
  JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 49 
that the formal elements of art are, indeed, universal; but 
that the contentual elements, while distinguishable from 
form, cannot be sundered from form; that democracy is 
most favorable to a sound art, through its insistence upon 
truth to life and the moral values, in terms of persons, which 
any genuine esthetic creation involves. Attention should 
also be called to the fact that, besides furnishing the dis- 
tinctive content of democracy’s life as such, America 
affords the dramatic content peculiar to America’s own 
specific conditions for democracy’s realization. This in- 
cludes such elements as our concrete historical background 
and movement; the determinations of our national life by 
the vastness of the country, sectional differences, oppor- 
tunities for dramatic tendencies counter to democracy in 
the chances of fortune, and in our inherited and borrowed 
tendencies; and, above all, and permeating all, the in- 
evitable conflicts, spiritual and material,.tragic and comic, 
belonging to a democracy as yet only in the earlier stages 
of being realized. 
The American social order has hardly begun to express 
itself through the arts. Some American literature has 
come nearest to such an expression, especially such as pre- 
sents to us an apotheosis of the common man and the com- 
mon life, interpretive of their real meanings. Of course, 
the first thing is for the American people to value the arts 
as worth while; and distinctively American art as a desir- 
able possibility. And one of the best ways to achieve this 
is for educational institutions to lay some stress upon the 
appreciation and creation of the beautiful. I much fear 
that this is contrary to the main American tradition; cer- 
tainly, it is contrary to the established tradition of the 
college. And yet, is the assumption of a genuine rela- 
tion between truth and beauty mere sentiment? Is there 
not a real relation, too, between moral and esthetic ideals? 
We remember how thoroughly Plato thought that there 
was.
-P-A-G-E-56
50 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
This is not to argue that the college of arts shall be 
turned into a school of art; to have visions of canvases 
and easels and long hair and Byronic collars and a sub- 
limated Latin Quarter. But one may well have a vision 
of the time when, in America, the beautiful shall no longer 
be regarded as merely incidental to life, instead of as an 
important and integral part of life itself. We have the 
motive of truth in education; in a small measure, too, the 
motive of morals under various guises. There is place for 
the motive of beauty as well. It need not and should not 
be expressed chiefly in special courses in esthetics. It can 
best be expressed through the education of the imagina- 
tion; not only through courses in literature, where, how- 
ever, the possibilities are obvious; but through the sciences 
as well. There is richly possible such a thing as the use of 
the imagination in scientific matters; does the student ever 
find it? Does the average instructor himself? Whether or 
no the future of American art, including literature, de- 
pends greatly upon the American college, from it might 
well be expected great things. ‘The college will have 
missed one very great phase of its responsibility to the 
social order, if it continues to ignore what is a fundamental 
note in any completely rounded civilization. 
Fifth, the American order implies distinct ideals of the 
meaning of religion. Casually, this assertion seems radical, 
even dangerous. It is, if not characterized with some care. 
But, a fundamental doctrine of what men are, such as the 
American order indubitably affords, cannot but have its 
implications within the realm of religion. The priceless- 
ness of the person is not only a democratic doctrine, but a 
religious doctrine. So, the social nature of the self implies 
that democracy’s person cannot accept any religion but 
one with social responsibilities; that it cannot be “saved” 
in terms of any selfish hedonism. Again, if democracy’s 
person is fundamentally rational, religion may not be con-
-P-A-G-E-57
  JAY WILLIAM HUDSON 51 
sidered as remote from other intellectual interests, in- 
cluding science, which often seems unwarrantably op- 
posed to it. Further, if persons are free, then religion must 
spring from within, however validly it may be stimulated 
from without. And, again, if persons are measureless in 
capacities, then religion must not be thought of as merely a 
negative constraint, but as a positive and expanding self- 
realization. 
Such are a few of the religious implications of the Amer- 
ican social order. Already, the churches tend to recognize 
them. Only such religion, whether Christian or Jewish, 
Catholic or Protestant, can furnish an adequate sanction 
for democracy’s ethical ideals. And such a sanction is 
needed. Closely allied to a healthy moral consciousness, 
is the religious consciousness — consciousness of those 
verities that strongly support and are logically implied by a 
living moral faith. To fight for the right, effectively and 
hopefully, is to have some sort of belief in the triumph of 
the right, which, at any definite moment in human his- 
tory, is never fully victorious; indeed, often apparently de- 
feated. It means a living faith in some power that makes 
for righteousness. 
While it is not the business of the non-sectarian college, 
with manifest obligations to the democracy of thought, to 
insist upon any too particular interpretation of religious 
verities (beyond their general spirit, as just outlined) no 
college should prejudice its youths against them, directly 
or indirectly. Yet, indirectly, and wholly unintentionally, 
this has certainly been done. It has been done because 
the concepts of physical science, confident through their 
successes over all other methods and contents of truth, 
have been taught in such a context as to insure the corol- 
lary of scepticism concerning the unseen verities. The so- 
called “rationalism” of some of our larger colleges is mostly 
the pretension of the natural science method to decide all
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 THE COLLEGE AND AMERICAN LIFE 
questions; a pretension of concepts to which I have referred, 
and which a new education must controvert. Almost any 
expert in the logic of method knows better; but his is a still, 
small voice, unheeded among the more strident achieve- 
ments which present themselves for acclaim in the world 
of the obvious. 
Such “rationalism” is irrational. A new emphasis upon 
the intangible, yet supremely real values which all facts 
must subserve, if they are to have the least glimmer of 
educational meaning, will involve the resurrection of the 
age-old rights of the realities we are accustomed to call 
“religious” to a consideration at least impartial. True 
education may yet mean the reasonable transfiguration of 
life, morally and religiously. After the tyranny of an age 
of “facts,” some of earth’s older glories may return to show 
how indispensable these facts of science indeed are; yet, 
how insufficient they ever must be, when left to their own 
barren services to themselves. 
Education may yet give us not only life’s reason, but 
something of its inspiration, too!

  —FHE OPEN MIND*— 
NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER 
In what spirit and in what attitude of mind the problems 
of practical life shall be approached by men and women 
who have had the benefit of the discipline and the instruc- 
tion of a university are matters of grave concern to those 
charged with the university’s oversight and direction. It 
is quite possible that one may be so assiduous in negligence 
and so skillful as to carry away from his college or uni- 
versity study little or nothing that will aid him to take a 
just, a sympathetic, and a helpful attitude toward the 
questions which life insistently asks. On the other hand, 
it is easily possible, and it should be normal and most usual, 
for the student to take with him from his college and uni- 
versity residence very much that will give him important 
advantage over his less fortunate fellows in estimating and 
in passing judgment upon men, upon tendencies, upon 
ideas, and upon human institutions. ‘ he has gained 
from his study and discipline a mastery over method, a 
trained habit of withholding judgment until the evidence 
has been heard, a moral standard that knows instinctively 
the difference between right and wrong and that ler 1s him 
to turn to the one as surely as it causes him to recoil from 
the other, then the university has furnished him well. 
But granted the possession of these habits and traits, it 
is essential to beware of the closed mind. The closed mind 
is not of itself conservative or radical, destructive or con- 
structive;(it is merely a mental attitude which may be any 
one of these or all of them in turn.) By the closed mind I

mean a mind which has a fixed formula with which to reach 
a quick and certain answer to every new question, and a 
mind for which all the great issues of life are settled once 
forall and their settlements organized into'carefully ordered 
dogma. Sug the closed mind the world is a finished product 
and nothing remains but its interested contemplation) 
The closed mind may be jostled, but it cannot have ex- 
perience. The name of a notable historic family, the house 
of Bourbon, has passed into familiar speech with the defini- 
tion of one who forgets nothing and who learns nothing. “ 
(The Bourbon typifies the closed mind. 
There is another type of mind equally to be shunned. 
To be sure this type of mind is not closed, for, unfortu- 
nately, it is quite open at both ends. (This is the type which 
remembers nothing and which learns nothing.) To it the 
name of no historic family has yet been given. There is 
every prospect, however, that some contemporary name 
‘may, through constant association with this type of mind, 
yet become as distinguished and as familiar in the speech 
of our grandchildren as the name of the house of Bourbon 
is distinguished and familiar to us. 
(pen-mindedness is a trait greatly to be desired) It 
differs both from the closed mind and from the mind which 
consists wholly of openings. The open mind is ready to 
- receive freely and fairly, and to estimate new facts, new 
ideas, new movements, new teachings, new tendencies; but 
while it receives these it also estimates them. It does 
not yield itself wholly to the new until it has assured itself 
that the new is also true. It does not reject that which is 
old and customary and usual until it is certain that it is 
also false or futile. 
The power to estimate implies the existence of standards 
of worth and their application to the new experiences of 
the open mind. These standards are themselves the pro- 
duct of older and longer experiences than ours, and they

form the subject-matter of the lesson which the 
teackes the immediate present. 
History offers a third dimension to 
of knowledge that each individual ac 
own experience. When one proclaims that he is not boun 
by any trammels of the past, he reveals the fact that he is 
both very young and very foolish. Such an one would, if 
he could, reduce himself to the intellectual level of the 
lower animals. He can only mean by such a declaration, 
that he proposes to set out to discover and to explain th 
world of nature and of man on his own account and as 
nothing had been done before him. He also jauntily 
sumes his own certain competence for this mighty and sel 
imposed task. His egotism is as magnificent as his wisdo 
is wanting. Such an one possesses neither an open min! 
nor a closed mind, but a mind open at both ends throug! 
which a stream of sensation and feeling will pour without 
leaving any more permanent conscious impression than the 
lapping waves leave on the sandy shore. 
The man of open mind, on the contrary, while keenly 
alive to the experiences of the present, will eagerly search 
the records of the past for their lessons, in order that he 
may be spared from trying to do over again what has once 
been proved useless, wasteful, or wrong. The man of open 
mind will watch the rise and fall of nations; the struggle of 
human ambition, greed, and thirst for power; the loves and 
hates of men and women as these have affected the march 
of events; the migrations of peoples; the birth, develop- 
ment, and application of ideas; the records of human 
achievement in letters, in the arts, and in science; the 
speculations and the beliefs of man as to what lies beyond 
the horizon of sense, with a view to seeking a firm founda- 
tion for the fabric of his own kndwledge and his own faith. 
His open-mindedness will manifest itself in hearkening to 
the testimony of other men, other peoples, and other ages,
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 THE OPEN MIND 
as well as in reflecting upon and weighing the evide1.ce of 
his own short-lived and very limited senses. 
There is a great difference between being intellectual and 
being intelligent. Not a few intellectual persons are quite 
unintelligent, and very many intelligent persons would 
hardly be classed as intellectual. One of the chief mani- 
festations of intelligence is open-mindedness. The in- 
telligent man is open-minded enough to see the point of 
view of those who do not agree with him and to enter in 
some measure into their feelings and convictions. He is 
able, also, to view the conflicting arguments and phe- 
nomena in proportion to each other and to rank the less 
significant of these below the more significant. It is quite 
possible to be intellectual and to manifest the closed mind; 
but it is not possible to do so and to be intelligent. 
It is the constant aim of this college and university, by 
act and by precept, to hold up the value of open-minded- ; 
ness and to train students in ways of intelligence. This 
university is the product of liberty, and it is passionately 
devoted to liberty. It finds in liberty the justification and 
the ground for open-mindedness, and also the source of 
those dangers which it is the business of the educated man 
to avoid. Open-mindedness in the university teaches the 
habit of open-mindedness in later life. Genuine open- 
mindedness guides to progress based upon wisdom. , That 
each one of you may have caught something of this spirit 
and may constantly and effectively manifest it in the years 
to come is our earnest wish and hope.

  CASTLES IN SPAIN! 
JOHN GALSWORTHY 
Wes of the modern world, what do we dream of? What are 
our castles in Spain? 
The thought came to me in Seville Cathedral, the stone 
fabric of man’s greatest dream in those ages to which we 
have been accustomed to apply the word “dark.” They 
who, traveling in Spain, consult their guide-books, may 
read these words: “On the eighth day of July in the year 
1401 the Dean and Chapter of Seville assembled in the 
court of the elms and solemnly resolved: ‘Let us build a 
church so great that those who come after us may think 
us mad to have attempted it!’...The church took one 
hundred and fifty years to build.” 
Men dreamed in those “dark” days, and carried out 
their dreams. In that silent building, incredibly beautiful, 
in that grove of sixty great trees of stone, whose vast 
trunks are jeweled by sunlight filtering through the high 
stained glass, in that stupendous and perfected work of art, 
raised by five succeeding generations to the glory of them- 
selyes and their God, one stood wondering wherein lay the 
superiority of ourselves, Children of Light, over those Sons 
of Darkness. 
We, too, dream. I have seen some of the results — the 
Great Dam at Assuan, the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona, the 
Woolworth Building, the Forth Bridge, the Power Works 
at Niagara — not yet the greatest of them all, the Panama 
Canal (which actually took one tenth of the time it took

60 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
the Sons of Darkness to achieve Seville Cathedral). But 
all these were dreamed and fabricked out for immediate 
material benefit. 
The builders of the giant mosques, the Temples of the 
Sun, the marvelous old churches, builded for no physical 
advantage in this life. They carved and wrought and 
slowly lifted stone on stone, to remote, and, as they thought, 
spiritual ends. 
We moderns mine and forge, and mason up our monu- 
ments, to the immediate profit of our bodies. Have we 
raised anything really great in stone or brick for a mere 
idea, since Christopher Wren built Saint Paul’s Cathedral? 
Now, the Sons of Darkness and the Children of Light, 
both, I think, have worshipped a half-truth. In the streets 
of Spain, in the Indian or Egyptian village, to this day 
you may see the shadow of these ancient great buildings 
fall as if with dark weight on a miserably poor humanity. 
The ancients builded for to-morrow in another world; they 
forgot that all of us have a to-day in this. They spent 
tiches and labor to save the souls of their hierarchy, but 
they kept their laborers so poor that they had no souls to 
save. They left astounding testimony to human genius 
and tenacity, majestic creations which can uplift the spirit 
of anyone who has eyes to see; but with all their dreams in 
stone to the glory of their gods, they kept simple man a 
beast of burden. And it never seems to have ruffled their 
consciousness that they purchased much of that ideal 
beauty with slavery, misery, and blood. 
,, We moderns have gone another way to work, worship- 
ping our half-truth. In place of those ideals for which the 
ancients worked — art, and the future life of their princes, 
politicians, and prelates — we moderns pursue what we call 
“progress.” All our stupendous achievements have this 
progressive notion at their back. We worship industry 
and trade. We think that if we make the wheels go round
-P-A-G-E-67
  JOHN GALSWORTHY 61 
fast enough, mankind is bound to rise on the wings of 
wealth. Look after the body, we say, and the spirit will 
look after itself. Whether we save a greater proportion of 
our bodies than the ancients did of souls, is more than 
doubtful. But no such trifling doubts shake gur belief in 
“progress.” 
Our modern castle in Spain is, in a word, “production,” 
and we have no other. It terrifies us, it paralyzes us, it 
is like a snake in front of a rabbit. It is like that Chinese 
general at whose name a million trembled. And what was 
his name? “Wu.” Sf 
It is machinery, of course, which has divide: ‘us from the 
ancients, given us a new culture and ideal. 
Machinery has quietly and gradually shifted the central 
point of man’s philosophy. Before the industrial era set in, 
men used to make things by hand; they were in some sort 
artists, with the artist’s — or at least the craftsman’s — 
’ pride in their work. Now they press buttons, they turn 
wheels; they don’t make completed articles, they work 
with monotony at the section of an article, so many hours 
of machine-driving per day, the total result of which is 
never a man’s individual achievement. “Intelligent spe- 
cialism,” says an English writer, “is one thing. It consists 
in one man learning how to do one thing specially well. 
But the sort of specializing which consists in setting thou- 
sands of human beings during their whole working lives to 
such a soul-destroying job as fixing the bristles into a hair- 
brush, pasting labels on jam-pots, or nearly any one of the 
varieties of machine minding, is quite another thing. It 
is an utter negation of human nature.” 
A man’s real interest in life is now not in his working 
day, but outside of it. The old artificers drew in their 
culture, such as it was, from their work; in these days, 
culture, such as it is, is grafted on to the workman in his 
leisure, as a sort of antidote to wheel driving. I don’t want  
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
to exaggerate — hewers, delvers, drawers of water could 
never have taken much pride in their work, and, on the 
other hand, we still have many among us to whom their 
work is of absorbing interest. The modern architect and 
engineer, for example, have a great deal of the artist in 
them — they have a passion for the perfection of their job, 
which they communicate to many of those working under 
them. But though they may raise in Brooklyn Bridge, or 
the Woolworth Building, a marvel of efficiency, which in 
certain lights is also a thing of beauty, Society did not com- 
mission them to erect these wonders primarily for the sake 
of their beauty, or in order that Presidents Wilson and 
Harding might go to heaven. And, on the whole, I think 
there has been a great change; pride of quality has given 
way to pride of quantity. Men used to make things as well 
as they could for the pride they took in making them (and 
because they sometimes used the thing themselves). Now 
it is to their interest to turn out the cheapest, most quickly 
made, and lowest form of article that the public will take; 
and we have to rely for quality, not on the maker’s pride of 
work, but on a grafted culture which keeps the public up 
to demanding a better sort of article. In old days the good 
thing was naturally supplied, nowadays it is artificially 
demanded. 
Of course there is much truth in the vague modern notion 
that if you take care of the body the spirit will take care 
of itself. Only, you must really take care of the body, and 
not just pretend to. And the trouble about this progress 
of ours — which is supposed to take care of our bodies, 
and of which machinery is the mistress — is that it doesn’t 
progress. We used to have the manor-house, with half a 
dozen hovels in its support. Now we have, say, twenty 
miles of handsome residences, with a hundred and twenty 
miles of ugly back streets, reeking with smoke and redolent 
of dulness, dirt, and discontent. Proportions are un-  
-P-A-G-E-69
    JOHN GALSWORTHY 63 
changed. The purple patches of our great towns are too 
often as rouge on the cheeks and salve on the lips of a 
corpse. Real progress would level up and gradually ex- 
tinguish the disproportion between manor and _ hovel, 
residence and back street. 
Let us be fantastic for a moment and conceive the civic 
authorities of London on the eighth day of July in the year 
1922, solemnly resolving: “We will remake of London a 
city so beautiful and sweet to dwell in that those who come 
after us shall think us mad to have attempted it.” It 
might well take five generations, but it would be real pro- 
gress. Alas! Our civic authorities have not been brought 
up to care a button for anything so unpractical as a castle 
in Spain. And say what you will in favor of democracy, 
there is always the trouble of getting any far-sighted and 
unbroken policy pursued. If anyone can furnish an anti- 
dote to the wasting tendency of short immediate policies, 
inherent in the system of government by bodies elected for 
short terms, he will be the greatest benefactor of the age. 
The life of a civic body is, I believe, about four years; we 
should want a procession of civic bodies who steadily loved 
castles in Spain, to make of London a stainless city of 
Portland stone, full of baths and flowers and singing birds 
— not in cages. 
But, seriously, we are very unfortunate in letting our 
civic life be run in the main by those who were born seeing 
two inches before their noses, and whose education, instead 
of increasing, has reduced those inches to one. It seems 
ungrateful! to criticize the practical business man whose 
faculties and powers, stamina and energy, make the more 
imaginative person gasp. One owes him, in fact, so much, 
that one would like to owe him more. But does his vision 
as a rule extend beyond keeping pace with the present? 
And without vision the people perish! Why, the age is so 
practical that the word “visionary” has actually a slighting
-P-A-G-E-70
  64 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
significance. And yet the really great practical adminis- 
trators have all had vision — men like Cesar, Chatham, 
Lincoln. And great men apart, there are really many 
naturally both practical and visionary. But in an age of 
specialism our method of education ever tends to develop 
one side of our natures at the expense of the other. 
If we can’t incorporate beauty in our scheme of life to- 
day, and foster the love of beauty in our children, the life 
of to-morrow and the children thereof must necessarily be 
as far from beauty as we are now. Surely it is strange to 
set men to direct the education, housing, and amusements 
of their fellow citizens, if they haven’t a love of beauty, and 
some considerable knowledge of art! And is it really going 
too far to say that the present generation of business men 
— with, of course, many notable exceptions — have a sort 
of indulgent contempt for art and beauty? Would they 
admit that art has been the greatest of all factors in raising 
mankind from its old savage state? And yet it is the con- 
templation of beautiful visions, emotions, thoughts, and 
dreams, expressed beautifully in stone, metal, paint, words, 
and music, which has slowly, generation by generation, 
lifted man to his present stature, such as it is, and mollified 
his savage nature. If it hasn’t been that, ask yourselves 
what it has been! Religion? The uplifting part of religion 
is the beautiful expression of exalted feeling. The rest of 
religion is but superstition. Think of the thousand wars 
fought in the name of superstition; of the cannibal feasts, 
the human sacrifices; the tortures of the Inquisition; the 
persecutions, intolerances, and narrow cruelties perpetrated 
even to this day. The stories and teachings of Buddha, of 
Christ, of St. Francis d’Assisi, were the beautiful expres- 
sions of exalted feeling, simple, and touching the hearts of 
men, as all true beauty does; and so they have done their 
ennobling work. They belong to the cult of beauty. 
Has trade, perhaps, been the mollifying influence and
-P-A-G-E-71
    JOHN GALSWORTHY 65 
elevator of mankind? I think, only so far as it has widened 
the reach of beauty, brought beauty within the range of 
multitudes, by opening up the lines of communication. In 
that sense, no doubt, trade has helped. But trade as trade 
has no real elevating influence — rather the contrary. 
No! Only beauty, in the largest sense of the word, the 
yearning for it, the contemplation of it, has civilized man- 
kind. And yet we don’t really take beauty seriously. Im- 
mediate profit rules the roost of us all in this age of ours. 
I leave it to the conscience of the age to decide whether 
that is good. For every age has a conscience, but it never 
comes to life till the age is on its death-bed. 
The fault of all ages has been this: beauty — the know- 
ledge and the love of it — has been kept as a preserve of 
the few, as the possession of a caste or clique. No great 
proportion of us are capable of creating or expressing 
beauty; but an immensely greater proportion of us are 
capable of appreciating it than ever have been given a real 
chance of so doing. 
It should be our castle in Spain to clear our age of that 
defect, and put beauty within the reach of all¥ Machinery 
has come to stay, so that we must perforce rely on grafted 
culture — in other words, on education. We must teach 
the young now to feel and see the beauties of nature and 
art. The modern age is not easy to teach. But we have 
exceptional facilities in these days for teaching what helps 
to keep life dignified, besides those simple accomplish- 
ments, cooking and keeping clean; we could bring an ink- 
ling at least of the fine arts, the architecture, literature, and 
music of the past to children even in the humblest schools. 
And why should not the children of’labor have as much 
chance to be familiar with beauty as the children of the 
rich? All economic revolution or evolution is hollow unless 
it means more demand for beauty — greater dignity of 
human life. Without that it must be simply retrograde,
-P-A-G-E-72
  
  66 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
destroying what beauty and love of it we have, with all to 
begin over again. What use in B’s despoiling A, if B is 
going to use his spoils no better, probably worse, than A? 
A mere lap of luxury would only make B fat. 
This is all platitude; and a great fuss about beauty, 
which cannot feed or clothe or warm the body, whatever it 
may do to that sentimental appanage, the spirit. 
I read in a journal not long ago: “One always suspects 
Mr. Galsworthy of a certain deep-seated sentimentalism.” 
I think the writer must have sold his castles in Spain at 
aloss. The fact is, one must be sentimental in this life to 
do anything except make money, and it is really better to 
have a castle in Spain than a villa at Newport or Cannes. 
The precise definitions of beauty are without number or 
— value, to speak of. I just use the word to mean every-~ 
thing which promotes the real dignity of human life. To 
illustrate the width of the word beauty as I am using it, 
I mention what we all understand: good sportsmanship. 
To be a good “‘sportsman,” a man shuns that which lowers 
his dignity, that which dims his idea of his own quality; 
and — his conception of quality derives obscurely from his 
sense of beauty. The dignity of human life demands in 
fact not only such desirable embroideries as pleasant sound, 
fine form, and lovely color, but health, strength, cleanliness, 
balance, joy in living, just conduct and kind conduct, for 
there is no beauty in the sight of tortured things. A man 
who truly loves beauty hates to think that he enjoys it at 
the expense of starved and stunted human beings or suffer- 
ing animals. A cruel or pettifogging sestheticism has some- 
times smeared the word beauty and given it a bad odor. 
But that is not the beauty which gleams on the heights in 
the sunrise. That is not our castle in Spain. 
But to put aside for a moment the sentimental, and come 
to business. Beauty, and the love of it, is surely the best 
investment modern man can make; for nothing else —
-P-A-G-E-73
  JOHN GALSWORTHY 07 
most certainly not trade — will keep him from destroying 
the human species. 
Consider what science has become in the hands of engi- 
neers and chemists; its destructive powers increase a hun- 
dred-fold with each decade; and the reproductive powers 
and inclinations of the human being do not vary. Recol- 
lect that nothing in the world but the love of beauty in its 
broad sense stands between man and the full and reckless 
exercise of his competitive greed; and remember the great 
war — a little war compared tc that which, through the 
development of scientific destruction, we shall be able to 
wage next time! Remembering all this, we get an inkling 
of the sheer necessity there is for us to invest in beauty and 
the love thereof. No other investment will give us interest 
on our money and our money back. Unbalanced trade, 
science, industry, will give us a high momentary rate of 
interest, but only till the crash comes again, and the world 
goes even more bankrupt than it is at present. 
The professor who has invented a rocket which will go 
to the moon and find out all about it (though whether it is 
to be boomerang enough to come back with the story, we 
are not told), that professor would, I venture to think, 
have done more real good if he had taught a school full of 
children to see the beauty of — moonshine. 
The next war will be fought from the air with explosives 
and gas, and may very likely be over before war is de- 
clared. The war after that will be fought with the germs 
of disease, distributed by wireless or something choice of 
that character. The final war necessary for the complete 
extirpation of mankind will be fought with radium or 
atomic energy; and we shall have no need to examine the 
moon, for the earth will be as lifeless. 
So much for business! To go back to sentiment, which 
is really what makes the wheels go round. Not even “big 
business” rules our instincts, and our passions. Imperial-
-P-A-G-E-74

ists, chemists, engineers, merchants, militarists — we are 
all deep-seated sentimentalists. The only question for us 
is: What shall we be sentimental about? Which is the 
fairer castle in Spain — quantity or quality? 
Consider for a moment the ideals which have been 
offered us instead of the pursuit of beauty, or quality, if 
that be a preferable word. 
Take, for instance, the ideal of happiness in a future life. 
If there be a future life for the individual, we obviously 
cannot reach happiness therein without having longed for 
and served quality in this, without having had that kind 
and free and generous philosophy which belongs to the cult 
of beauty and alone gives peace of mind. The pursuit of 
beauty includes, then, whatever may be true in the ideal — 
happiness in a future life. 
Take the ideal of material comfort in this life. But the 
cult of beauty, of quality, includes all that 1s good in this 
ideal, for it surely demands physical health and well-being; 
sane minds in sane bodies, which depend of course on a 
sufficiency of material comfort. All the rest of the ideal 
of wealth is mere fat, sagging beyond the point of balance. 
As a fact, modern civilization is offering us a compound 
betweer happiness in a future life, and material comfort in 
this, lip-serving the first, and stomach-serving the second. 
We get the keys of heaven from our banks, and we don’t 
get them if we haven’t a good balance. Modern civiliza- 
tion is, on the whole, camouflaged commercialism, wherein 
to do things well, for the joy of doing them well, is rarer than 
we think. We have even commercialized salvation — for 
so much virtue, so much salvation. Always — always — 
quid pro quo. 
But let us give the devil its due. Let us admit at once 
that in spite of everything this is still the best age on the 
whole that man has lived in. It is in its own way very 
thorough — our modern civilization. It has made ad-
-P-A-G-E-75
JOHN GALSWORTHY 69 
vertisement into a fine art, equipped bedrooms with tele- 
phones; it diagnoses maladies with extreme punctilio. A 
doctor examined a young lady the other day, and among his 
notes were these: “Not afraid of small rooms, ghosts, or 
thunderstorms; not made drunk by hearing Wagner; 
brown hair, artistic hands; had a craving for chocolate in 
1918.” The age is thorough in its way. But there’s a kind 
of deadly practicality about its production: all for to-day, 
none for to-morrow! The future will never think us mad 
for attempting what we do attempt; we build no Seville 
cathedrals. We don’t get ahead of time. 
We have just let slip in England, the chance to get our 
country life going thoroughly once more. At demobiliza- 
tion we might have put hundreds of thousands on the land, 
which needs them so badly for a dozen reasons. How many 
have we put? Not so many as the war took away from the 
land. Admitted that life on the land means hard work, 
burnt faces, and maybe bowed backs; it also means hearty 
stock for the next generation. A nation concerned only 
with its present is like the man who was fishing, and, feeling 
sleepy, propped his rod up on the bank, with the line in 
the water. A wag spied him sleeping, took the rod, waded 
across the river, propped up the rod on the opposite bank, 
and lay down behind a hedge to watch for the awakening. 
Such is the awakening in store for nations which enjoy their 
present and forget there is a future. 
The pursuit of beauty as a national ideal, the building 
of that castle in Spain, is no picnic. Idlers need not apply. 
Consider the rank growth which must be cut down, the 
stumps and roots to be burned out and cleared, the swamps 
to be drained, before even the foundations can be laid. And 
— after — what long and patient labor and steadfastness 
of ideal before we begin to see rise a fair edifice of human 
life upon this earth. 
Members of a practical race will say: “Well, what do
-P-A-G-E-76
70 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
you want ustodo? Cut the flower and come to the fruit?” 
Alas! All literary men can tell people what they oughtn’t 
to be; that’s — literature. But to tell them what they 
ought to do is— politics, of which no literary man is 
guilty; for politics and literature afford the only instance 
known — in virtuous countries — of divorce by mutual 
consent. The contempt of politicians for literary men is 
only equalled by the contempt of literary men for politi- 
cians. It would be impertinent, then, for a literary man 
to suggest anything practical. Let me, however, make a 
few affirmations. I do believe that, on the whole, modern 
man is a little further from being a mere animal than the 
men of the Dark Ages, however great the castles in Spain 
those men built and left for us to look upon; but I am sure 
we are in far greater danger than ever they were, of a swift 
decline. From that decline I am convinced that only the 
love and cult of beauty will save us! 
By the love and cult of beauty I mean a great deal — 
higher and wider conception of the dignity of human life; 
the teaching of what beauty is, to all, not merely to the 
few; the cultivation of good will so that we wish and work 
and dream that not only ourselves but everybody may be 
healthy and happy; and, above all, the fostering of the 
habit of doing things and making things well for the joy 
of the work and the pleasure of achievement, rather than 
for the gain they will bring us. With these as the rules, the 
wheels of an insensate industrialism, whose one idea is to 
make money and get ahead of other people — careless of 
direction towards hell or heaven — might conceivably be 
spoked. 
As it seemed to me, the great lack of our age is an ideal, 
expressed with sufficient concreteness to be like a vision, 
beckoning. To me there is no other ideal worthy of us, or 
indeed possible to us in these unsuperstitious days, save 
beauty — or call it, if you will, the dignity of human life.
-P-A-G-E-77
    JOHN GALSWORTHY 7 
One or two writers of late have urged the need of more 
spiritual beauty in our lives. They mean what I mean, but 
it is unfortunate to talk of spiritual beauty. We must be 
able to smell, and see, hear, feel, and taste our ideal as 
well. We must know by plain evidence that it is lifting 
human life, that it is the heritage of all, not merely of the 
refined and leisured among us. The body and soul are 
one for the purpose of all real evolution, and I regret any 
term which suggests a divorce between them. But no- 
body, I think, can mistake what is meant by quality, or the 
dignity of human life. Anything which crosses and offends 
against that ideal is our Satan. And the only way in which 
each one can say “ Retro Satana” is to leave his or her tiny 
corner of the universe a little more dignified, a little 
more lovely and lovable than he or she found it. 
It may seem absurd to be writing like this in a world 
whose general mood at the moment is utter disillusion- 
ment and gloomy spite. The world is cross-eyed just now; 
when it weeps out of one eye, the tear runs down the other 
cheek. And it is difficult to be in love with a lady like that. 
I, for one, find it extremely hard not to be acynic. Latest 
opinion assigns eight or ten thousand years as the outside 
length of time during which what we know as civilization 
has been at work. Still — ten thousand years is a con- 
siderable period of mollification. One had rashly hoped 
that mankind was not to be so speedily stampeded; that 
traditions of gentleness, fair play, chivalry, had a little 
more strength among Western peoples than they have been 
proved to have had since 1914; that mob feeling might be 
less, instead of, as it seems, more potent than it used to be. 
Only very constant self-reminding that the fault was in 
one’s self, that one was a facile observer, a dreamer who 
did not look deeply enough beneath the surface; a rider 
before the hounds; only that, and a constant self-reminding 
of the individual patience, good humor, endurance, and  
-P-A-G-E-78
72 CASTLES IN SPAIN 
heroism which goes so queerly hand in hand with stupidity, 
savagery, greed, and mob violence, can save a man from 
turning his back on the world with the words: “Cats and 
monkeys, monkeys and cats, all life is there!” 
Fear is at the back of nearly all the savagery in the 
world; and if there be not present in the individual that 
potent antidote — the sense of human dignity, which is 
but a love of and a belief in beauty, he must infallibly suc- 
cumb to fear. There are tremendous difficulties in the way 
of coherent progress, of all fair and far ideals under the 
régime of short-lived elective bodies, a régime essentially 
exposed to stampede through popular opinion and the 
emotions of the moment. Seeing the violence of which 
military autocracy is capable, one is liable to become too 
blind a devotee of democracy. But democracy has no 
greater enemies than her unthinking friends. Short sight 
is her danger, short sight verging on blindness. What will 
happen if democracy really goes blind? She must have an 
ideal, a star on which to fix her eyes — something distant 
and magnetic to draw her on, something to strive towards, 
beyond the troubled and shifting needs, passions, and pre- 
judices of the moment. Lovers of beauty, those who wish 
to raise the dignity of human life, should try to give her 
that ideal, to equip her with the only vision which can save 
the world from spite and the crazy competition which leads 
thereto. 
We of this still young century may yet leave to those 
who come after us at least the foundations of a castle in 
Spain such as the world has not yet seen; leave our suc- 
cessors in mood and heart to continue our work; so that 
one hundred and fifty years perhaps from now, human life 
may really be dignified and beautiful, not just a breathless, 
grudging, visionless scramble from birth to death, of a 
night with no stars out. 
Dreamer — deep-seated sentimentalist — the immortal

JOHN GALSWORTHY 73 
Don riding his Rosinante on the bare brown uplands of 
Spain never saw so crazy a vision, so fickle-shining a mi- 
rage! Who knows? The world is changing. It must 
change, or perish; the forces of destruction, the inherent 
futilities of the present order, are too great. And there is 
in human nature, after all, the instinct of self-preservation, 
a great saving common-sense. 
The past six years have been the result of the past six 
hundred years. The war was no spasmodic visitation; it 
was the culmination of age-long competitions. The past 
six years have devoured many millions of grown men, more 
millions of little children — prevented their birth, killed 
them, or withered them for life. If we begin again these 
crazy competitions, without regard for beauty or the dig- 
nity of human life, we shall live to see ten millions perish 
for every million perished in this war. We shall live to 
curse the day — this day when, at the end of so great a 
lesson, we were too sane to take it to heart; too sensible 
and practical and business-like and unemotional to see 
visions and dream dreams, and build our castle in Spain.

WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF COLLEGE 
STUDENTS TOWARD ORGANIZED 
RELIGION? 
ALBERT PARKER FITCH 
I 
Ir is not easy to give any answer to this question which will 
be sufficiently accurate to be illuminating. It is never a 
simple matter to discern what youth is thinking or feeling, 
either on those matters which it believes to be important 
to itself or those which it is aware we propose or desire it 
should regard as such. There is always a gulf fixed be- 
tween middle age and youth though for the most part age 
only dimly comprehends it. We who have grown up re- 
member our childhood with sufficient and rather senti- 
mental clearness and we have a vivid realization alike of 
the trials, the responsibilities, and the privileges of age. 
But the years of our adolescence tend to fade from our 
memory. ‘Those days of swift transition, of continuous 
experimentation, of unrelated, irresponsible, and ephemeral 
expansions left no enduring marks upon the tablets of the 
mind. For the most part we have so far forgotten their 
significance that we do not even realize they have passed 
out of our recorded consciousness. 
This largely accounts, I think, for the characteristic im- 
patience of our self-protective prudence with the gay and 
careless destructiveness of newly awakened life. This is 
why age has more of jealousy than sympathy for youth and 
why it is more prone to expect adolescence to understand 
and pay tribute to what appear to it the self-evident stand-

  ALBERT PARKER FITCH 15 
ards of maturity, than to remember the need and difficulty 
of thinking itself back into the morning of life. Few older 
men can deal with youth imaginatively. Hence professor 
and student live side by side in outer decorum and super- 
ficial companionship, but the real springs of action and the 
scales of value by which youth builds its life are often care- 
fully concealed. 
This is particularly true when the discussion deals with 
matters of faith and conduct. The sense of the malad- 
justment is between an older and a younger generation 
strongest here. Youth does not understand its own atti- 
tude toward religion any too well. It is both self-conscious 
and self-exacting and these traits increase the inhibitions 
induced by the sense of the obtuseness and remoteness of 
older lives. Moreover, youth is not unaware that the 
reasons age brings forward in the support of established 
institutions are often more ostensible than real, that it is 
not so much the intrinsic worth of organized religion as it is 
its by-product of stability, comfort, and professional se- 
curity which endears it to its defenders. The Profits of Re- 
ligion is a grotesquely unfair and one-sided book but there 
is truth in it and just the kind of truth that youth can per- 
ceive. Youth thinks that age demands more of it in the 
way of intellectual and moral docility than it, itself, is pre- 
pared to give. 
In short, a community of young people strives on the 
whole toward higher standards of thought and conduct 
than does the armored and respectable middle age around 
it. However fantastic and perverse some of its contem- 
porary expressions may seem, nevertheless it is generally 
distinguished by ethical insight and moral sensitiveness. 
Youth sometimes fails dreadfully but it is more honest with 
itself regarding its failures, realizes their nature more 
keenly, and takes them more seriously than does the older 
life about it. Hence the spiritual atmosphere of a college
-P-A-G-E-82
16 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
or a parish, which offers the only medium for the exchange 
of real thought and emotion, is clouded by false values. 
The young idealists in it are tongue-tied and uncertain 
except when talking among themselves; the older formal- 
ists are too exacting, especially of other people, and too ex- 
pressive, at least in public. Hence the initial suspicion 
with which youth regards both professional advocates and 
conventional forms of religion; hence the voluntary ex- 
pression of religion among the better undergraduates is 
meager, reticent, not easily analyzed. Quite aside from 
any other reasons there is something inherent in the nature 
of the relationship and the different status of the lives com- 
posing it in a college community which makes a just and 
aecurate common understanding difficult. 
The first thing, then, to remember about such a discus- 
sion as this is the peril of quick answers. We are hearing a 
good deal at present about the godlessness of modern youth 
and the immorality of the present generation. But easy 
summations of undergraduate attitudes, either by way of 
censorious condemnation or sentimental praise, are all 
likely to go wide of the mark. We should understand 
youth better, if we were more confident of it, more critical 
of ourselves; if we approached it with a mixture of dis- 
interested and expectant observation and some personal 
humility. There is something truly ironical in the ap- 
parent simplicity of academic relationships, something al- 
most fatuous in the bland acceptance on the part of older 
men and women of the mere appearances in youth of 
virtue or vice, piety or irreligion. There is something, too, 
profoundly unjust in the easy generalizations, the all but 
absolute judgments by which an established order betrays 
its resentment at the critical scrutiny or frank hostility of 
young life.  
-P-A-G-E-83
  ALBERT PARKER FITCH 17 
I 
Let us attempt a dispassionate analysis, from the 
point of view of the churches, of the undergraduate com- 
munity. We shall discern at once three conventional at- 
titudes toward organized religion on the part of college 
students. They are all of them classic; they illustrate, in 
the realm of the religious interests, corresponding reactions 
having the same characteristic emphases and approaches 
which may be found in the economic and social and po- 
litical life of the time. First: there is the natural conform- 
ist. He is the boy who is temperamentally “good,” who 
identifies religious faith with external moral practices. He 
issues from average, middle-class American life, the son of 
a thrifty, practical, unimaginative household. He has had 
a sober and careful bringing up. He has been taught to 
read the Scriptures, to say his prayers, to attend church. 
There is often a frank and naive strain of commercialism 
in his piety; he has been schooled to remember that social 
disgrace or academic failure, or material ruin, are the 
punishments of irreligion and immorality. He largely 
conceives of religion in the terms of group respectability ; as- 
sumes that the content of the moral law is practically un- 
changing from generation to generation. Wrong and right 
are simple and self-evident; they are mutually exclusive 
territories, separated by clear boundary lines. Faith and 
character are achieved by remaining in the right territory. 
Boys of this group often have substantial sanity, a rather 
shrewd and sensible scale of values. But their imaginative 
deficiencies, their narrow range of desires and interests, 
with the accompanying intolerance and complacency make 
them unlovable and relatively neglible figures among their 
peers. This group has sent many recruits into the ministry 
in the past. Some of them have become saints and have 
deepened and enriched the life of the profession. But on 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  78 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
the whole they have not strengthened it. They have not 
had enough creative ability to be great preachers. They 
have approached the ministry with a too simple notion of 
its duties; it has been strangely mechanicalized in their 
minds. It has appeared to consist of preaching pleasantly 
an accepted message furnished ready to their hands, of 
making routine calls, of gently perpetuating existing or- 
ganizations — even if with a slowly diminishing momen- 
tum! Instinctively they have expected the institution to 
carry them; the office to make the man, not the man the 
office. It was such innocuous, if complacent conformity 
which the late William E. Godkin had in mind, when, re- 
ferring to a distinguished foreign university, he observed 
that it was an ideal place for those youth who were chiefly 
interested “in lawn tennis, gardening, and true religion.” 
The numbers of these men, however, are diminishing in 
the college just as middle-class religion, with its passion for 
respectability and its identification of faith with conven- 
tional conduct is, in proportion to the growth of the popu- 
lation, everywhere diminishing as well. 
Second: there is the group of the young institutionalists. 
They are a more characteristic product of our present 
society and therefore more significant to our discussion. 
They come from a richer and wider environment, are more 
developed personalities, than their conforming comrades. 
They do not share in the moral naiveté of the first class; 
sometimes they do not share its moral scruples either. The 
boys of this group identify religion with a half-romantic, 
half-mythical allegiance to impressive and picturesque in- 
stitutions. They link up this allegiance in their minds with 
subscription to creed, a sort of class allegiance to the for- 
mule promulgated by an imperial and established organiz- 
ation. ‘There are certain classic statements of the Chris- 
tian faith. They move the imagination, both subdue and 
elevate the minds of sensitive and reflective youth, partly 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  ALBERT PARKER FITCH 79 
by their esthetic and mystical appeal, partly by the very 
prestige of their antiquity. They are the confessions of 
faith of a splendid and imperial standing order. They 
appeal to the best in the aristocratic impulse, its sense of 
the continuity of life, its perception that you must not di- 
vorce the present from the past, its understanding of the 
slowly refining, carefully garnered deposit which makes up 
all that is best in human experience. 
These youth are not moved by any terrific moral strug- 
gle or by the evangelical passion for soul-saving. The 
prophetic note in them is absent. They are Churchmen; 
social and religious Conservatives. Sometimes when they 
grow older they, like John Neville Figgis, carry side by side 
with medieval forms of religion quite radical views in po- 
litical economy and social science. But essentially re- 
ligion is to them a perpetuation of an established and 
authoritative order. 
When these men enter the ministry, they become not so 
much the shepherds of sheep as spiritual governors of 
parishes. The world regards with something of reluctant 
admiration, something more of covert hostility and dis- 
trust, their amalgam of the urbane manners and self- 
assurance of this world, with the offices of priest and 
preacher. Boys whose religious instinct expresses itself 
in these ways are increasing among us and they are turning 
naturally to the Roman and Anglican communions. The 
main current of our age flows steadily and relentlessly 
against the institutionalist and his type of religion. But 
there are many cross-currents in any generation and a new 
exaltation of institutional religion is one of them which is 
discernible at this moment. As the American home be- 
comes more and more sophisticated and society becomes 
older, more highly developed and rigid in its customs, al- 
legiance to all established institutions grows among us. It 
represents the determined effort of a relatively completed 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    80 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
and well adjusted social order to defend itself, its achieve- 
ments no less than its privileges, from the crudeness and 
destructiveness of the new forces now struggling upward 
in society. Most men who have gained anything of per- 
manence hate and fear change. They identify the ac- 
companiments of a new order, its bohemian living, its flip- 
pant and reckless iconoclasm, its attacks upon special 
privilege with the order itself. This, they think, is all there 
is to it. So they withdraw into the citadel of institutional 
orthodoxies. 
A fair number of college men who are now entering the 
ministry are of this group. It does not matter much what 
learning they receive in college which seems to vitiate either 
the historic pretensions or the intellectual statements of 
their faith. They have already cast in their lot with the 
older order, they are not inquirers so much as they are 
partisans. They will by no means be a negligible force in 
the coming generation. By no perceivable possibility can 
they become the leaders of the age into which we are now 
advancing. But they will skilfully and resolutely oppose 
it; they are far more formidable opponents than their 
simpler brethren of the first group, and they will have con- 
siderable influence. 
Third: there is the young humanitarian. He is a com- 
mon and obvious type of undergraduate, more in evidence 
a decade ago than now, the boy who expresses his religion 
through its substitutes, who meets his spiritual problem by 
evading it. He puts effects in the place of causes; practical 
efficiency takes the place of spiritual insight. The ardent 
if superficial humanism of recent years has produced the 
youth who identifies religion with social reform, piety with 
organized benevolence, and spiritual leadership with ad- 
ministrative efficiency. To work is to pray, social service 
is character, a rarefied amiability is faith. 
Such a lad is a past master at planning a missionary
-P-A-G-E-87
  ALBERT PARKER FITCH 81 
campaign, engineering a student conference, and “pro- 
moting” a Bible class. He knows how to “swing it right.” 
He sees nothing incongruous in organizing a risqué under- 
graduate vaudeville show to raise money for the support of 
asettlement house. He will be found teaching at a down- 
town mission, or acting as scoutmaster for local gamins, or 
installed as a religious work director. He is a wholesome 
and aggressive youth, friendly, rather too approachable, 
amazingly able and resourceful in practical affairs. He has 
character, is not imaginative, is terribly at ease in Zion. It 
is largely from this group that the ever-to-be-replenished 
ranks of student Christian association secretaries, graduate 
secretaries, student-volunteer leaders, are recruited. 
These men, for the most part, accept the essentials of the 
present order. They do not scrutinize the intellectual and 
emotional sources of our present religious and economic 
structure. They would rather mitigate its abuses than 
reform its principles. They are natural if unconscious 
pragmatists. Their passion is for action; they want always 
to be “doing things.” The goal of social service, which is 
ever before their eyes, and their passion for “results” 
makes them superficial leaders. They take refuge from 
the difficulties of thought in the opportunities of action. 
A few of these men, not many, go into the ministry. 
Generally speaking, it repels them by its emphasis upon 
religious passion and spiritual insight. Also, they are con- 
temptuous of what seem to be the lax business methods and 
practical inefficiency of the average church. They are not 
so large a group in the college as they were before the war, 
for its brutal dislocations shook this type of youth out of 
his notion of salvation by expansion and reformation by 
machinery, 
I 
Probably all the men of these three groups which we 
have been discussing represent when combined decidedly
-P-A-G-E-88
  82 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
less than half the undergraduate body. The remainder of 
it, which is a substantial majority of the whole number, 
forms the group which is most significant to our purpose. 
It can be classified under two heads. First there are the 
modern pagans. A large number of contemporary under- 
graduates are not irreligious to-day, they are non-religious. 
They are neither hostile nor contemptuous as regards re- 
ligion; they are indifferent to it, they know nothing about 
it, they are relatively incapable of experiencing it. There 
is much truth in the neglected Calvinistic doctrines of elec- 
tion and predestination. Probably all men cannot be 
saved; some of them are antecedently incapable of salva- 
tion. Such boys as I am describing are the natural product 
of the materialism and commercialism which represents 
one-half of the American character of the moment; they 
are neither very much better nor worse than the homes 
from which they issue. But this group of obtuse and un- 
awakened lads is one of the most significant factors in 
undergraduate life, more characteristic of the immedi- 
ate problem which confronts the college and the nation 
than any one of the other groups we have as yet mentioned. 
The grosser forms of immorality are not common among 
them, they are more vulgar than vicious, hopelessly secular, 
but not bad. Their language is callously profane and has 
a sort of a moral coarseness about it. Their literature is 
principally Snappy Stories, the Saturday Evening Post and 
the sporting pages of the daily prints. Their most natural 
occupations appear to be striving for some club, indulging 
in college gossip, or indefinite discussion of athletic events 
in which they themselves took no part, and alternating be- 
tween the “movies” and innumerable dances. 
In short, they are men in whom the esthetic, intellectual, 
and spiritual interests are almost wholly undeveloped and 
to whom organized religion makes no contribution and for 
which they feel no slightest need. Religion in general
-P-A-G-E-89
ALBERT PARKER FITCH 83 
would seem to have no quid pro quo to offer them. The 
number of these men has very largely increased in the 
American college. They are changing its habits of thought 
and conduct, its scale of values as regards courses, the 
whole esthetic and emotional level of the group. They 
undertake their four years of college life mostly for social or 
practical reasons and they leave college nearly always for 
business or for law. 
If organized religion wants to test out how much of a 
power it still is in the college, let it see if it can evangelize 
this group. Success or failure with them would be an 
actual measure of its vitality, a real snatching of brands 
from the burning. The other groups we have discussed are 
temperamentally disposed toward some sort of acceptance 
of the churches. This group is one of the two for whose 
salvation the churches specifically exist. We should never 
draw many leaders from its numbers; can we recruit the 
laity from it? It is significant that at present this group 
remains almost wholly untouched either by college preach- 
ing or by the Y.M.C.A. activities of the undergraduate 
body. 
Finally, there are the intellectual and esthetic radicals. 
This group probably comprehends by far the largest 
number of valuable men in the college community. It is 
composed of the boys who have both intellectual and emo- 
tional equipment and along with their brains and their 
heart, they have the accompanying spirit of the adventurer. 
Such youth are natural come-outers. They are possessed 
of character as well as intellect. Their moral code is often 
not that of their elders and they are sometimes rather 
brutal in their disdain of inherited prohibitions. But they 
have a code of their own, they govern their lives, keep their 
appetites within reasonable bounds, respect themselves. 
They have a passion for intellectual integrity and for ac- 
curate appreciations and judgments. They are unsenti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
84 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
mental by nature, and dislike, as they dislike few other 
things, the boy who is only temperamentally or emotionally 
religious. They have a disconcerting habit of ignoring the 
considerations of expediency or the sensitiveness of their 
interlocutors when scrutinizing a conviction or analyzing 
an institution. 
Now the most significant fact we have yet touched upon 
is that these men also are almost wholly outside the in- 
fluence of organized religion. The first reason for this is 
either the lack of any religious training in their homes or 
church in their earlier youth, or, as is more often the case, 
their having received a training which has been both mis- 
taken and inadequate in content. Neither Sunday school 
nor minister ever pointed out to them the difference between 
scientific and religious truth. Scientific truth is the exact 
agreement of observation and judgment with fact. It is 
an affair of the intellect, it calls for mental accuracy, is 
capable of precise demonstration. Ethical truth is the 
harmonious adjustment of conduct to the moral and social 
constitution of man. Insight into the nature of this ad- 
justment is as much, if not more, an affair of the imagina- 
tion than of the mind; the allegiance to ethical truth might 
be called more of a practical than an intellectual experience. 
Moral truth is not capable of mathematical demonstration, 
but only of a gradual and relative verification in experience. 
Religious truth again is the perception of the right relations 
between man and the universe as a whole. Such truth is 
generally presented to mankind in the form of personalities, 
it comes in the guise of personages who by their imagina- 
tive insight, their spiritual intuitiveness, have worked out 
or grasped an attitude both toward men and God which 
satisfies and interprets the lives and consciences of those 
who behold it. There are speculative, mystical, and 
gesthetic values in religious truth which do not enter into 
scientific observation of fact. The imagination plays a
-P-A-G-E-91
ALBERT PARKER FITCH 85 
part here which it does not play with the natural investi- 
gator. 
Now such fundamental distinctions are primary ele- 
ments in religious growth and education. But for the 
most part they are not given by churches or parents. Able 
youth are sent to college believing that the truth of re- 
ligion stands or falls with historical accuracy of the gospel 
narrative or with the correctness of inherited systems of 
opinion. They have been encouraged to identify religious 
truth either with theological beliefs or with faith in some 
inerrant writings or with the concept of an omniscient 
Christ. When the church says that Jesus is the truth, it is 
talking of truth as a form of personality, as a system of 
relations, and of the Lord Jesus as being, by the common 
consent of human experience and observation, all that a 
man ought to be in these relations. He is truth in its final 
form, a true person. All this, these men have not been 
taught; they suppose that what the church asserts as 
“true,” is some particular brand of theological or ecclesi- 
astical orthodoxy. Thus, their teaching before ever they 
come to college has given them no preparation for what 
they will find there; it not only has been deficient but it 
has been positively false. 
The inevitable of course happens when these boys of po- 
tential intellectual and esthetic power are introduced to 
the free intellectual processes and stimulated by the sudden 
expansion of scientific knowledge which come to them 
as undergraduates. They quickly perceive how far the 
thought and feeling and knowledge of their day have out- 
stripped the creed and practice of ecclesiastical, as of other 
contemporary, organizations. They perceive that to some 
real degree the churches are outmoded in conduct and re- 
actionary in belief. They are aware how far contemporary 
psychological and social science has advanced beyond the 
consciousness of most preachers and how dreadfully it dis-
-P-A-G-E-92
86 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
credits their usual concepts regarding nature and human 
life. They have an acute and somewhat exaggerated per- 
ception of how discarded is the philosophic view of the 
world which lies behind classic systems of theology and 
they see how inconsistent with the ethics of Jesus is both 
the theory and the practice of our imperialistic and ruth- 
lessly competitive society. They are aware that con- 
sciously or unconsciously the laity support the churches 
quite as much for social and economic as for religious rea- 
sons. In short, they perceive that their inherited ethical, 
theological, and ecclesiastical orthodoxies will not stand 
the test of scientific investigations and they think these are 
to be identified with religion. Hence, not understanding 
the nature of religious truth they soon lose any sense of the 
value of it. In the beginning, they look with scorn upon 
the minister as the official of an order of ideas which he 
must know is no longer defensible and they regard the 
church as a drag upon society. 
Now these are able boys. And before they are through 
their Senior year they have become more or.less aware of 
the difference between religion and theology, an art and 
its science, the self-verifying moral and spiritual experience 
of the Lord Jesus and any particular philosophic or prac- 
tical implications with which men have clothed it. They 
have come to perceive the difference between religious and 
scientific truths. But it is then, for the most part, too late 
to reclaim them, because their active lives have already 
gotten substitutes for the faith which they discarded. They 
are absorbed in intellectual pursuits. Just as we are told 
of Darwin that his early and vivid delight in music be- 
came entirely atrophied through long absorption in purely 
scientific pursuits so the interest of these youths in the dis- 
tinctively religious expression of their ethical and imagina- 
tive life has perished. They give themselves to philosophy 
or economics or political science; they are still devoted men
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  ALBERT PARKER FITCH 87 
but their devotion is to wisdom, they worship truth, not the 
God of truth. They are young men of character, but it is 
respect for themselves and humanity, not awe and loyalty 
in the presence of a holy being, which is alike the motive 
and the sanction of their conduct. Some of them give a 
genuine discipleship to the old classic ideals of beauty and 
justice. They prefer this to the personalized and too often 
the timid and obscurantist religion of the churches. 
Other men in this group, not possessing as great intel- 
lectual power or as keen scientific interests, hold aloof from 
organized religion for esthetic reasons. They are sensitive 
to the various aspects of beauty. Indeed, boys who under- 
stand the significance and value of the esthetic world are 
rapidly on the increase in this group. To them the stenciled 
walls and carpeted floors, the anomalous furnishings and 
frock-coated officials, the popular romantic and quite ir- 
religious music of the average Protestant sanctuary are 
both ludicrous and repellent. With all the joyous cruelty 
of youth they pitilessly analyze and condemn it. 
More and more the college is training these abler youth 
to a critical appreciation of the intimate and significant re- 
lationship between sublime ideas and deep emotions and 
a restrained and beautiful, an austere and reverent, ex- 
pression of them. The very age itself, with its immensely 
increased interest in the dramatic and plastic and descrip- 
tive arts, tends more and more to feed their imaginative 
life and to make the standards of that life more consciously 
exacting. But our average non-liturgical service has not 
much to offer their critically trained perceptions. They 
find little of beauty or of awe in the Sunday morning serv- 
ice. Indeed our church habits are pretty largely the trans- 
fer into the sanctuary of the hearty conventions of middle- 
class family life. The expressions and attitudes of life 
which are precious to such youth, the subtle and precise 
and mystical ones get small recognition here. They feel
-P-A-G-E-94
    88 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
like uncomfortable outsiders or truculent misfits in the 
Sunday morning congregation. Therefore, partly for 
reasons of intellectual integrity and partly for reasons of a 
genuine esthetic distaste and partly because organized re- 
ligion has been crowded out by other interests which also 
feed mind and spirit, they avoid the Christian church. It 
does not seem to move in their world. They are quite 
aware that it tries to stand for, and once did stand for, real 
values. They, too, think those values are real but that 
they are no longer within its custody. 
It is conceded that very few of the abler men in college 
to-day, either the students of distinguished intellectual or 
creative capacity, are turning toward the Christian minis- 
try. It does not seem to me difficult in the light of what we 
have been saying to understand why. It is not because 
these men are devoid of religious capacity or of ethical loyal- 
ties. Quite the contrary; they are the men who are going 
to be the leaders of the higher life of their generation. But 
modern life offers many new professions and occupations 
into which imaginative spirits and keen minds may enter. 
The new engineering professions, the opportunities of big 
business, give scope for the work of the constructive imag- 
ination and the analysis of the keen mind, which an earlier 
and simpler age denied. Political and economic reform call 
for the highest moral and mental qualities. Hence it is not 
altogether consonant with the genius of our day that it 
should produce such conventionally religious spirits as 
medieval civilization gave birth to. Nevertheless, the 
general defection of this group upon the Christian ministry 
and the churches is gravely significant as to the probable 
immediate future of organized religion. For if we have 
lost our hold on men of this sort, then, whether or not we 
win the battle at any other point of the line, our real suc- 
cess in controlling the thought and feeling of society is 
problematic indeed. If we have lost these men as both
-P-A-G-E-95
ALBERT PARKER FITCH 89 
laymen and leaders in the churches, all other gains are 
gravely diminished thereby. 
It would not be true, I suppose, of this group, that they 
would say that the ministry is not a “man-sized” job. 
They began, in the first flush of intellectual activity in their 
Sophomore year, by saying that, but now they would be 
quite aware that religious and moral leadership of this 
generation offers a herculean task. But they have become 
indifferent to it and are rather of the conviction that the 
churches are neither able nor indeed anxious to really un- 
dertake it. There is plenty of dormant religious capacity 
in this group, much unexpressed spiritual ability. But it 
regards the only ministry possible for it in this generation, 
because the only one compatible with clear thinking and 
fine feeling, as one outside of the ecclesiastical institution. 
This is obviously a half-truth, by no means a perfectly just 
attitude. But then all human convictions are combina- 
tions of half-truths; vague hearsay, blank prejudice, fond 
fancy, are component parts of all our thinking and feeling. 
We shall never gain the men of this group by railing at them 
or by pitying ourselves for their unsympathetic attitude or _ 
by denying the large measure of justification that lies be- 
neath it. If we ever do win back their allegiance it will be 
by a generous and frank appreciation of those very gifts of 
intellect and character which have turned them away. And 
we shall make a grave mistake if we suppose that in any 
age of the world keen minds and tempered spirits have been 
shut up to our expression of the higher life. 
My general attitude must be clear from the foregoing 
observations. The attitude of college students toward 
organized religion is very far from what we should like it to 
be, but the trouble is not so much with these young men as 
with our own organizations. Able and sensitive youth are 
naturally religious. They are also naturally scrupulous 
that whatever of religion they bring themselves to openly
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 STUDENTS AND ORGANIZED RELIGION 
espouse, shall be candid in spirit, intelligent in content, 
beautiful and dignified in expression. If there is to be 
again a warm and confident alliance between academic and 
ecclesiastical life and if the ablest youths are again to enter 
the ministry, the churches will have to change more than 
the colleges. In so far as religious institutions adapt their 
interpretations of religious experience to the world-view of 
to-day, according as they promulgate a moral code not 
formed to meet the problems of a vanished and simpler 
order of society but adapted to the new and urgent pro- 
blems of an urban and industrial civilization, and in so far 
as they can recognize that the beautiful has as much place 
in life as the holy and the good, they will interest and at- 
tract undergraduate life. There is an infinite pathos in the 
wistfulness with which many idealistic boys regard the 
church to-day as an organization hostile to mental freedom, 
indifferent to beauty, and insistent on a procrustean 
morality; there is something deeper than pathos in the in- 
difference and almost contempt which exists between so 
many youth in the coming generation and the Christian 
church. In their heart of hearts these boys would like to 
worship, to believe, to openly espouse a holy and a sacrifi- 
cial life. If that be true, what is the reason the church can 
do so little with them?

THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES! 
H. G. WELLS 
One of the most attractive and at the same time most 
baffling of speculations is to guess about the progress of 
science, and about the possible inventions of the years 
ahead of us. BafHing and uncertain it is bound to be. 
As a friend of mine put it, “It is trying to think about 
what won’t be thought of for ever so long.” But that is 
just a little more witty than it is true. 
Coming inventions cast their shadows before — cften 
shadows that are centuries long — and one may have a 
reasonable conviction that a tree is going to bear fruit, even 
when the blossom is just budding. Frosts, blights, and 
suchlike disasters may disappoint the most justifiable hopes 
for a year or even for a succession of years; nevertheless, a 
survey of the possible scientific harvest is well worth mak- 
ing. It may even, to extend our horticultural image, set 
us spraying or protecting some threatened crop. 
The last hundred years has been a century productive 
on a stupendous scale of mechanical inventions arising out 
of physical and chemical discoveries. It has been an 
epoch, a corner in human history. There have been great 
advances in medicine and surgery also, but these — the use 
of anesthetics and antiseptics, for example, and the ap- 
plications of microscopy — have been largely by-products 
of chemical and physical progress. 
There has also been a great expansion and clarification 
of biological knowledge; but although this has produced 
profound effects upon religious thought and moral ideas,

mission of the editor and the author.

  94 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
it has not yet given any such revolutionary practical 
results in human affairs as have the inorganic sciences. It 
has made possible the new developments in psychology, 
upon which I shall have more to say presently, but it has 
yielded no direct dividends. 
When we talk of inventions and the triumphs of science, 
it is of steamships and great machines, rapid transport, 
electricity, wireless, and the airplane that we think; and 
when we turn to the future our first idea is of another shelf- 
ful of still vaster and more astonishing mechanical con- 
trivances. But that may be just the common error of 
prophesying by continuing the current movement of things 
in a straight line. It is quite possible that there may be no 
further physical or mechanical discoveries of first-class im- 
portance forthcoming for a very long time. That, at any 
rate, is my own conviction. 
Of course there will be improvements in detail, increases 
of efficiency, economies, and so forth. The railways may 
be scrapped, and probably will be scrapped within another 
half-century, as slow and wasteful; we may have a steady 
improvement in road material; the airplane and possibly 
the airship may go on developing and improving; we may 
presently transmit pictures as well as sounds by wireless, 
survey and map the polar regions, and so forth and so on. 
But there will be nothing beyond the airplane; only an 
improved airplane. Nothing beyond wire-borne or wire- 
less telegraphy; only speedier and more effective trans- 
mission. We shall thresh out and make the most of that 
great harvest of the last hundred years that has come in 
from the physical field; but from that field I do not believe 
there will be any fresh harvest, any new things now, any 
really revolutionary changes, for quite a long time. 
This will strike some readers as a flat contradiction to 
much current expectation. They will ask: “ What about 
all these new discoveries in physics about which we have  
-P-A-G-E-101
H. G. WELLS 95 
heard so much? What about Einstein? What about the 
energy of the atom?” 
Well, these things, I think, are just the first blossoms of 
another spring, whose harvest may still be hundreds of 
years away. Weare not likely to get much out of them but 
wonder, for a long time. 
Einstein has given us a new, a more free and more subtle 
way of thinking about the space-time system in which we 
live. But that is unlikely to have any immediate practical 
reaction upon human life at all. And there is much wild 
and baseless talk about the possible utilization of atomic 
energy; but though that is good enough for a fantastic 
story, it is not good enough for a serious discussion of prac- 
tical developments in the near future. 
We have come to know that several elements, and pos- 
sibly most or even all elements in the space-time system we 
call our universe, are undergoing a steady — and in most 
cases an extremely slow — process of decomposition which 
releases energy. And that is a very marvelous thing to 
realize. We already make a clumsy, half-superstitious use 
of that released energy in the radium treatment in medicine. 
But nobody has yet made the ghost of the shadow of a sug- 
gestion how that process of decomposition might be de- 
layed or accelerated. Current science has no more practical 
justification for hope that this can be done than that we 
may presently be able to turn on or turn off the gravita- 
tional pull, and make things heavier or lighter. 
Our universe, which carries us along with it through 
time, has these characteristics of gravitation and molecular 
decomposition, and we do not know why it has them. 
Some day it may begin to dawn upon men why these 
things are so, and then our race will get to business. But 
I do not believe that atomic energy is coming into human 
affairs until such names as Kinstein, Curie, and Soddy and 
so forth, seem as remote and past as do the names of Archi-

medes and Hero to-day. Hero, as the reader will remem- 
ber, described a turbine steam engine nineteen centuries 
before it became of any utility. The primary properties 
of frictional electricity were on record in the time of Aris- 
totle. The fruit of these curious flowers of knowledge took 
a score of centuries to ripen. 
That first great wasteful harvesting of material science, 
which has been going on during the past hundred years, is, 
I believe, drawing to its end. The next is still too far off 
from our present experience for us even to guess about it. 
It is in quite other directions now that I think we must 
look for the next main crop of practical results from scien- 
tific thought and research. 
The past century has been the supreme century of 
material achievement; the next and the twenty-first cen- 
tury will, I believe, be the great fruiting and harvesting 
time of psychological and physiological science. Man, 
having run all over his world from pole to pole, having 
learnt how to fly round it in seven or eight days, and how to 
look or speak round it in a flash, will presently, I think, be- 
come introspective and turn his practical attention to him- 
self. 
Unfortunately it is necessary nowadays, before one talks 
in this popular way of psychological science, to make it 
perfectly plain that one does not intend that term to cover 
any of that queer traffic in messages from the dead and the 
like which figures in certain circles as “psychic” science. 
The whole of this mass of legend and lore is no doubt of 
interest to the psychologist but rather because of what it 
teaches us of the infirmities of the human mind as a truth- 
seeking, truth-testing instrument than for any light it 
throws upon the nature of men or things. 
For a third of a century since his college days the writer 
has watched this flow of necromancy, telepathic experi- 
ment, and pseudo-scientific inquiry; for some years he was 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
H. G. WELLS o7 
a member of the English Society for Psychical Research; he 
has observed the exploits of clairvoyants, read occult books 
so far as such books are readable, heard the late W. T. 
Stead relate the adventures of his Double, watched the 
careers of Sir Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge, endured 
the marvelous histories of many inferior story-tellers. And 
his growing conviction is that in this vast cloud of wit- 
nesses, in this fog of unprogressive assertions, there is no 
grain of any substantial reality, that there is nothing in it 
at all beyond deliberate fraud, unconscious fraud, self- 
deception, the will to believe marvels, the craving to be 
marvelous, the suggestibility of unguarded minds, tricks 
of divided personalities, uncritical treatment of coinci- 
dences and resemblances, the obstinacy of men committed 
to a view, very ancient traditions about ghosts and magic, 
received as fables and then strengthening to belief, re- 
inforcing legends from the East, hallucinations fostered and 
welcomed, and last, but not least, the moral decay and im- 
aginative excesses due to the use of drugs. 
As the years have passed, the writer has become less and 
less interested in the raps and the scratchings, the enig- 
matical mutterings of the medium, the automatic scrawlings 
on the table, and more and more curious and fascinated by 
the motives and hidden thoughts of those who sat around 
the revelation. Later on, he may be able to deal with this 
queer world of the psychic investigator; at present he men- 
tions it only to express his complete skepticism of any 
progress or promise in that world. 
But what is of the greatest promise in the science of the 
present time is the new study of human motives which 
centers about what is called psycho-analysis. The science 
of psychology as it was presented to me when I took my 
educational diploma a third of a century ago was about as 
empty a science as one could well imagine. It was reso- 
nantly empty. Sully’s “Psychology,” the first textbook I
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
encountered, a book written by an Englishman of French 
origin, was as logical and lucid a development of false 
classifications and negligently observed realities as the 
Latin mind has ever produced. It was as handsome and 
impressive as the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triomphe and, 
like those glories, it got nowhere and did nothing. Mental 
phenomena were neatly classified into Thinking and Feel- 
ing and Willing; and the methodical assembling of sensa- 
tions into percepts, and of percepts into concepts, which it 
expounded so charmed my sense of order that for quite a 
long time I did not realize, and indeed it was only after I 
had read Hoffding and William James that I began to real- 
ize that, as a matter of fact, no such synthesis went on in 
my mind at all, but quite different and much more com- 
plicated processes. 
The advances that have been made in psychology since 
then have been enormous. In the last thirty or forty 
years psychology has laid out a whole new scheme of foun- 
dations. It has passed through a period of establishment, 
very much as the science of physics did in the later seven- 
teenth century, and the science of chemistry in the early 
nineteenth. Much light has come in from the side of ex- 
perimental neurology, but the greater beginnings of the 
new psychology lie in the works of Freud and Jung. These 
two men, so different from each other in character and 
quality, Freud the homely and absurd, and Jung the 
poetic, will take a place side by side in the history of their 
field of science comparable to that of Gilbert or Newton or 
Faraday or Pasteur in their respective fields. They have 
broken up a soil that was previously hard and obdurate, 
and now it is bearing crops in increasing abundance. 
They have given us a new and mentally most invigorat- 
ing view of the human being from within, as a system of 
impulses and counter impulses or restraints; they have 
enabled people to picture, as they were never able to pic-
-P-A-G-E-105
H. G. WELLS 99 
ture before, why and how they think and act, why they 
find some things easy and desirable to do and some things 
unattractive and hard to do, why they incline to believe 
this fact and resist the conviction of that fact, and how 
their conscious life is borne along upon a great stream of 
unconscious mental activities, the existence of which was 
scarcely suspected half a century ago. There has also 
been a great increase in our knowledge of the mind, not 
simply as an individual mind but as an associated unit in a 
mass or group mind. 
These new methods and new views and new discoveries 
are evidently recasting our fundamental ideas about the 
growth, the activity, and the interaction of human minds, 
and upon that recasting of these ideas I believe that there 
is bound to follow such a reconstruction of our methods of 
using our minds and of education, and of the direction of 
human associations, as will be comparable to the recon- 
struction of methods of transport or of metallurgy during 
the last hundred years, due to the application of steam, 
steel, and electricity to these methods. 
The coming hundred years or so will be, I believe, es- 
sentially a century of applied psychology, with which a 
considerable amount of physiological science respecting 
glands and nervous states, drugs and secretions, will be 
very closely involved. It will mark a revolution in human 
affairs altogether more profound and more intimate than 
that merely material revolution of which our great-grand- 
parents saw the early beginnings, and amidst whose 
achievements we live. 
The material revolution of the past century or so first 
affected the fields and towns and the distribution of the 
population of the world; it appeared as great railway 
cuttings, gashing the familiar landscape, bridges, smok- 
ing engines, railway stations, jerry-buildings. The new 
revolution of the coming days appears as a disturbance of
-P-A-G-E-106
  100 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
the intellectual surface, as a new directness in art that 
makes much old achievement seem platitudinous, as a more 
penetrating curiosity in readers and an abandonment of 
many gracious conventions in literature, as a breach with 
many of the disciplines and restraints of the past in thought 
and act, as an increasing tendency to psychologize legal, 
political, financial, and economic conceptions. It will 
presently be making more extensive contacts with the 
common life through the schools of the world. It is al- 
ready stirring in many schools and in the minds of all the 
best of our younger teachers. 
Before very long we shall begin to realize that there is a 
new sort of education active in the world, a more purposive 
education, an education bound up with new and clearer 
ideas of the psychology of economic and _ political life. 
There has been a curious discontinuity, hitherto, between 
our educational institutions and the realities of life: the 
former has not led to the latter, but has rather shrunk from 
it and away into elegant bypaths. 
The school has professed to make citizens, but rather it 
has stimulated a few competitors for success and failed to 
equip them for the struggle. This is because there has 
been and still is no clear theory of motives in the modern 
community; our economic and financial life and much of 
our social life has grown up without such a theory and in- 
dependently of our schools altogether. But the vague, 
scrambling, accidental sort of living that makes up the 
world of men at the present time is not a necessary or per- 
manent condition of things; the human intelligence resents 
it and will finally prevail against it. It is no more a per- 
manent condition than the disorders of Germany after the 
Thirty Years’ War and the present disorders of Russia are 
permanent conditions. All the world to-day is living ina 
phase of exceptional disintegration and reconstruction. 
Our schools cannot train our peoples for orderly life be- 
cause there remains no assured orderly life.
-P-A-G-E-107
  H. G. WELLS 101 
But that state of affairs will not last. The mind of the 
intelligent teacher rebels against the aimless work he does, 
the aimless discharge of young people into an uncharted 
world. Yet he realizes that he cannot educate with any 
effectiveness unless he has a clear idea of the sort of life for 
which he is educating. 
As we reshape our ideas of social justice and relation- 
ship, the character of our schools will change and education 
will realize its aims anew. Schools are a part of state- 
craft. The same growth of applicable psychology that 
will give the teacher a real power in developing dominating 
ideas and training motives in his school will give the world 
outside the school a conception of political and social or- 
ganization based on a balance and reconciliation of mo- 
tives quite beyond the scope of our present understandings. 
It is curious how difficult people find it at present to 
accept the idea of a mental as distinguished from a physical 
change in human conditions. Nowadays it startles nobody 
to suggest that it may presently be possible to go to the 
moon or the center of the earth for a holiday, or jump into 
another dimension, or prolong the individual life to a 
hundred and fifty. 
But the suggestion that presently there may be a sort of 
education, and a sort of social and economic order in the 
world, that will have the same relation to the schooling 
and politics and law and business of to-day that the Wool- 
worth Building or an ocean liner has to the hut or canoe of 
a savage is met by an incredulous resistance. They think 
that the school will always be the dull, tiresome place it is 
to-day; the teacher the same ineffective, underpaid weak- 
ling; business the same loud, disingenuous, and dangerous 
sprawling scramble; and employment the same distasteful 
drudgeries. They think there will always be the same 
amount of war, crime, and failure that there is to-day. 
Yet it is just such an application of the sciences of men-
-P-A-G-E-108
  102 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
tal relationship as will change and modify these things 
directly and profoundly which is the most immediately 
probable thing before our race. 
Faced with the forecast that there will presently come a 
phase in the life of our race when the general behavior will 
be as different from and as much better than the general 
behavior of to-day as that is different from and better than 
the general behavior in a cannibal village in Central 
Africa, most people have been trained to reply that “you 
cannot alter human nature.” 
That, in its way, is perfectly true, but it is also perfectly 
irrelevant. It is not only human nature you cannot 
change. You cannot change the nature of anything. You 
cannot change nature. But in the last hundred years we 
have learnt to do ten thousand things with nature we 
never knew how to do before, and in the coming centuries 
we shall learn to do ten thousand things with human nature 
that we cannot do now. 
It is because of my belief in the enormous creative and 
reconstructive power over human motive latent in the 
science of psychology, and even now being unlocked for 
our use, that I find myself inclined to be more than a little 
impatient and disrespectful with the laws, the poor, feeble, 
silly schools, the flags and political institutions, the eco- 
nomic methods and business tangles that confuse hu- 
man affairs and darken our days and worry our nights at 
the present time. 
I feel, in relation to such things, much as an American 
with some gift of vision might have felt in the middle of the 
last century as he drove his lumbering wagon day after day 
across the Western prairies, in danger of thirst and famine 
end scalping Indians and disease. Filthy and footsore, 
anxious and with night coming upon him, he might have 
had a sudden vision of the great smooth train, brightly lit 
and well equipped and swift, that would carry his grand-
-P-A-G-E-109

children to and fro across this lonely and frightful desola- 
tion. 
So too in this present twilight of human division and in- 
security, amidst oppressions and strikes, shortages of goods 
and slumps in welfare, irreconcilable hatreds and the rumors 
of fresh wars, it is still possible for those who have faith 
and vision to foretell a new release of human life to a secure 
and world-wide peace, to a sufficient and happy production 
to satisfy all normal human needs, to a common life of 
generous activities and kindliness and lively interests and 
enterprise and hope. 
And it is along the line of a sedulous pursuit and a vigor- 
ous application of psychological science that this release is 
attainable, and will be attained. 
Let me be a little more explicit about the possible appli 
cation of a new, invigorated and growing science of psy- 
chology to practical human matters. Consider first how 
it is that we keep a sort of peace between man and man in 
our communities, and maintain a general understanding 
of what a man may do and what he may not do. We do 
this through the law and the law courts, with a certain 
apparatus of police and so forth added thereto. 
But the laws that hold us together in a community are 
the most complicated tangle of traditions, compromises, 
pedantries and expediencies possible, an out-of-date and 
discredited tangle; the procedure of our courts is a mixture 
of tradition, negligence, and slovenliness; the manners of 
the ordinary barrister toward witnesses and even toward 
his own profession in court are barbaric; the methods of 
our law have had no effectual revision for ages. An 
English law court takes us back to the Middle Ages; the 
medieval gowns, the seventeenth-century wigs, emphasize 
its stale antiquity. Lawyers cling to the physical dis- 
com#nrts of the past; no other profession would work in 
the dim, dirty, dusty, untidy offices in which lawyers still
-P-A-G-E-110
  104 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
evidently delight. Only people upon the verge of lunacy 
will enter a lawyer’s office if they can avoid it. It is like 
stepping into a seventeenth-century kennel. 
Nearly every one who has studied these things agrees 
also that our prisons are an apparatus for destroying the 
souls of men, even more antiquated than the law courts 
which send them thither. The ideas of human misdemeanor 
that rule in our courts to-day are hardly in advance of 
those dominant in Nebuchadnezzar’s Babylon. 
The crimes that men commit and which bring them 
under the bludgeonings and torturing restrictions of the 
law spring only very rarely from any natural blackness in 
the human heart. The great bulk of offenses against 
property can be immediately traced to that morbid fear of 
poverty which our economic insecurities engender; most 
murders and crimes of violence arise from the jealousies and 
intolerable situations that our ruthless marriage laws pro- 
duce; a residuum springs from the boredom of living a 
restricted life in a dull world. Most crimes that lead to 
prison to-day are really outbreaks due to human distress. 
It we could eliminate, and we could eliminate, most of that 
distress, the crimes men would commit would be rare and 
trivial. And every day our psychological science makes 
these statements more incontrovertible and points our 
way more plainly to the relief of human distresses. 
It is ridiculous to suppose that these things will remain 
at their present level. It is ridiculous to suppose that, 
with a growing armory of assured knowledge available, 
the constructive and generous motives latent in man will 
not presently set about this business of bringing law and 
the adjustment of human relations up to the level of con- 
temporary science, with at least as much intelligence and 
resolution as they set about in bringing the methods of 
transport up to that level a century ago. 
We know now, at least as certainly as men knew in 1880.
-P-A-G-E-111
  H. G. WELLS 105 
that flying machines were possible, that it is possible so to 
plan production in the world that we could all be far richer 
and more free and all of us infinitely happier in producing 
our wealth and freedom, than we are to-day. We know 
with at least an equal certainty that we can so organize 
the general education in relation to our general economic 
and political organizations that the bulk of mankind will 
grow up happily, prepared for lives of creative service. 
We know that all the international troubles of our time, 
the mutual injuries of nation and nation, the threat of war, 
are all due to mental things, that can be changed and cured 
by mental methods, persuasion, suggestion, teaching, and 
training. 
But just as in 1880 the common fool was quite sure that 
we should never fly, because no one had done so, so now 
the common fool is incredulous of social, political, and edu- 
cational developments he may even live to see and share. 
And just as flying came slowly and as the achievement of 
asmall] faithful minority working in an atmosphere of ridi- 
cule, so now it must be the work of a comparatively small 
body of steadfast believers, in schools and colleges and 
studies, in law courts and legislatures, in administrative 
positions and works offices, in the rooms of consultants and 
the talk of parents, that the new gifts of psychology to 
mankind must be tried over, worked on and brought into 
effective relationship to human life. 
If I could revisit the world in 2424 a.p. five hundred 
years from now, I doubt if I should find travel more than 
twice as fast as is travel to-day, or any great further 
developments of material invention, but I am sure that I 
should find schools that would have the same relation to 
the schools of to-day that an airplane has to the travelling 
coach that took Sterne to Paris; I should find prisons and 
lunatic asylums almost completely swept away; I should 
find in England the relations to man no longer complicated  
-P-A-G-E-112
106 THE GIFTS OF THE NEW SCIENCES 
by the intervention of old gentlemen in wigs and scarlet; I 
should find the economic system unencumbered by a bitter 
scramble for mere possession and war a fading tradition in 
the memories of man. And this, I should realize, was due 
to no miracle in men’s hearts and souls and to no great 
social or political revolution, but simply to the same, sober, 
common-sense application, here a step forward and there a 
step forward, of that scientific study of men’s motives, 
which begins so propitiously about us now. I give myself 
a margin of five hundred years. But it may take much 
less time for mental science to overtake physical science 
and to bring these things about.

CHANGING VIEWS OF EVOLUTION ? 
ELLWOOD HENDRICK 
Wuenever the morale of mankind grows weak, whenever 
we forget our obligations and seek only our benefits — in 
short, whenever humanity sinks in ideals of life and con- 
duct and grows selfish and succumbs to that ignorance 
which is always followed by selfishness and moral decay, 
those who protest against the study of causes spring up on 
every hand. They construe the beginning and end of all 
human thought to accord with some favorite dogma or 
catechism. Everything else anathema. They appeared 
in great numbers on both Catholic and Protestant sides 
during the Reformation and after it — and see what a mess 
they made of it! They could not have been right since 
both sides were so addicted to murder. What kind of 
Christianity was that of the Thirty Years’ War? 
After the enthusiasm and the beauty of the Renaissance, 
when humanity began to go backward again, losing its 
nerve and its ambition and its glory in lovely things and in 
grand adventure, the Holy Inquisition became active, and 
who is there to sing its praises to-day? On this side of the 
water after the intrepid pioneers had settled the Massa- 
chusetts colony and things began to be a little easier, and 
responsibilities became fewer and purpose began to sag, 
there were uneasy souls who claimed to discover witches 
and then persecuted them. Different people and different 
dogmas, with different surroundings, but the same disposi- 
tion as that of the Holy inquisitors. To-day their kindred 
spirits are attempting to forbid the study of biology and

they would put us in irons and send us to prison if we ex- 
pound comparative anatomy. 
In 1809 Lamarck proposed the doctrine of evolution in 
his Philosophie Zodlogique. His work fell immediately 
into disfavor because his contemporary Cuvier supported 
the generally accepted doctrine of special creation, and 
Lamarck became the butt of ridicule. 
Just about fifty years later, in 1859, Charles Darwin 
propounded the theory again, in his Origin of Species. He 
laid greater stress on natural selection than Lamarck, but 
the work was an outline of evolution. Darwin was more 
fortunate than the earlier proponent because he had friends, 
or rather, supporters, among men of scientific scholarship. 
Spencer, Huxley, Haeckel, Tyndall, and others developed 
the philosophy. In the face of active protest the subject 
received a hearing. During my own boyhood in the seven- 
ties the theory was in the air and widely discussed. It did 
not conform to the established dogmas of special creation, 
and from many quarters it was condemned as an invention 
of Satan. Clergymen in their pulpits grew very profane 
over it. That is, some did, while others did not. Henry 
Ward Beecher preached evolution with gusto and with 
marvelous eloquence, and he had an immense following. 
Suddenly, as though it occurred overnight, a great 
change came over us. Evolution was almost universally 
accepted. It was swallowed, bait, hook, and sinker. 
Nearly everybody believed in it. Even those who had 
preached against it with anger and violence changed their 
minds, and declared themselves in favor of it. Professor 
Louis Agassiz, who was somewhat of a humorist, suggested 
that the earth had been developed in six periods of time, in 
six infinitely long days; and this gave him nation-wide re- 
pute for piety. 
How did this sudden change come about? History 
seldom tells us real causes. It does not tell us why the
-P-A-G-E-115
  ELLWOOD HENDRICK 109 
Fundamentalists won in the fifth century, and what caused 
the great awakening of mankind in the thirteenth, or the 
spirit of adventure and love of beauty in the Renaissance, 
or the dearth of art over nearly the whole world from the 
sixties to the eighties of the last century. Perhaps some 
day we shall have a History of Human Emotions and grow 
wise by perusing it. But the cause of this great change, 
this almost universal acceptance of evolution, is not hard 
todiscover. It was not the sudden illumination we thought 
it to be. No; the great change came about because evolu- 
tion, as construed by the laity, was an appeal to human 
vanity. 
Evolution was universal. It included all life and applied 
to society and to us. Men differed from beasts by virtue 
of a special gift of soul, although this was hardly universal, 
because I recall a sermon by a fashionable preacher in 
which he comforted his audience by asserting that they 
would surely meet the souls of their pet dogs in the heav- 
enly choir. Everything was accepted because evolution 
consisted in a great onward and upward surge, of which we 
were part and parcel. We were sailing along to higher 
spheres of loveliness and godliness. Our children would 
possibly be better than we, but that was because they were 
our children. We could sit still and twirl our thumbs, 
doing nothing, and yet remain part of the vast onward and 
upward sweep. Our complacent vanity was the basis of 
our faith. We were smug rather than enlightened. 
Then came Weismann, and he upset the apple cart. 
“Acquired characteristics,” said he, “are not transmitted. 
Evolution is merely a biological expression with many 
limitations.” The substance of his contention is that 
numberless experiments show that plants and animals 
which have been changed by extraordinary conditions 
such as war, or by laboratory experiment, or grown amid 
abnormal surroundings revert to the original type in their
-P-A-G-E-116
  110 CHANGING VIEWS OF EVOLUTION 
offspring; that is, that such physical stigmata are not re- 
produced in later generations. At first there was a general 
protest against this. It conflicted with the notion of the 
great surge of evolution as we understood it, and with 
which we were completely satisfied. We pointed to steam 
engines and railways and telegraph and telephone and to 
modern industry with its sweatshops to prove that every- 
thing was moving gloriously forward. Biologists listened 
to Weismann, and many followed him. There was surely 
something wrong in the popular concept, and Lamarck and 
Darwin passed into eclipse for a time. Weismann held to 
the persistence of the type, and in this respect he was right. 
We shall see later whether types are modified by acquired 
characteristics or not, but for the time being it was denied. 
Then came along also Mendel’s Law of Heredity which 
has demonstrated itself. Stated in its simplest form, in 
terms of unit characters, it is as follows: White Leghorn 
fowls, for instance, will breed only white fowls and black 
Leghorn only black. Crossings will yield in the first gen- 
eration a mixed pigmentation, called “blue.” These hy- 
brids yield in the next generation a brood in which one half 
are black and white in equal proportions (i.e., a quarter are 
white and a quarter are black), and the remaining half of 
the brood are blue. Note, please, that this has to do with 
fowls just alike except as to color. Different unit charac- 
teristics do not pass on together. Thus, if a blond Nordic 
man was mated to a black Hottentot wife she would bring 
to their progeny so many characteristics besides pigmen- 
tation that they would all be negroid for a number of 
generations, even though mated with blond Europeans. 
But some would have light hair, others would have straight 
hair, and still others would have blue eyes. 
Now, in place of color, it has been suggested that we sub- 
stitute the characteristics superior and inferior. This, I 
admit, is stretching a point, because it may take many  
-P-A-G-E-117
ELLWOOD HENDRICK lll 
unit characteristics to make up superior. But if we as- 
sume that the presence of some single unit character in 
abundance will establish superiority, while its lack will 
cause inferiority, then we may go on with our example. 
Superior will beget superior, and inferior will beget in- 
ferior. But by cross breeding, the first generation will all 
be mediocre, and the second will be half mediocre, one 
quarter superior, and the remaining quarter inferior. The 
tule of, first hybrids, and second 2:1:1 holds true in regard 
to each characteristic, but it becomes very complex as we 
proceed. We can readily see, however, that we can breed 
any characteristic into or out of a family if each succeeding 
generation be kept under control. 
Where is the onward and upward surge now? Every- 
thing in evolution that appealed to human vanity has been 
eliminated. The great sweep is often backward and down- 
ward. The fittest do not survive always. As soon as 
evolution ceased to be compressible into an intellectual 
nutshell, as soon as we could not claim to achieve merit by 
doing nothing, the whole philosophy was discarded by the 
Fundamentalists who returned to their catechisms. 
The fact is, evolution is too big a subject to be put into 
harness and driven. Weismann made a great contribution 
as to the persistence of type, but here again even the 
learned had got the idea out of its proper relation to other 
facts which have to be considered. We know that certain 
strains of inheritance are of immense value. It appears 
that the type will prevail, no matter what we do to it. 
Thus, if we cut off the tails of a thousand generations of 
mice, their progeny will continue to grow tails. There are 
many phenomena that seem to emphasize the theory of 
the persistence of type. The records of eminent families 
and of criminal families in contrast, all go to prove that 
the strain is important; that blood will tell. 
Having reached this conclusion, we must immediately
-P-A-G-E-118
112 CHANGING VIEWS OF EVOLUTION 
begin to revise and modify it, according to facts, because 
nobody can be at once profoundly scientific and at the 
same time complacent and cocksure. Evidence to the 
contrary has been coming along rather frequently of late. 
Last year we read a report of a family of white rats brought 
up on a whirling platform. The progeny of these rats 
walked in circles. A later family was trained to go through 
a long passage to get a piece of cheese when a bell rang. 
That is, the cheese became available at the farther end of 
a long and intricate passage whenever the bell rang. It 
required fifty-two separate ringings and feedings before 
they learned the trick and scampered through the passage 
to get the cheese. Then they were taken out and mated, 
and their progeny were put back in the cage with the long 
passage. They occuped it in place of their parents. But 
they learned that the same bell meant cheese available in 
five lessons against fifty-two required for the parent rats. 
Records of hunting dogs indicate that the progeny of 
good hunters become good hunting dogs, but that the pro- 
geny of those that have not been worked with a gun are 
far less likely to be of value in the field. 
It is the quality of his mind that is man’s principal dis- 
tinction. At birth the mind is of a low order, and its 
development is slow. If a good one, it does not cease to 
grow at maturity; it is better at thirty than at twenty, and 
better at forty to fifty than at thirty. It would appear, 
therefore, that men of eminence would be likely to be the 
children of mature rather than immature or very young 
parents, and statistics seem to bear this out. That is, the 
spread of years between the birth of grandparents and 
grandchildren seems to be greater among eminent men than 
it does with those who do not achieve distinction, provided 
always that among the parents and grandparents there has 
obtained a serious effort to use the mind. This is Red- 
field’s principal contention, and he gives an immense array
-P-A-G-E-119
ELLWOOD HENDRICK 118 
of statistics to support it. He holds that races deteriorate 
when the immature are prone to mate. The glory of 
Greece and Rome continued so long as their young men 
went off to the wars and did not return to beget their kind 
until they were mature. When the wars ceased the breed 
deteriorated, because they mated earlier in life. Here is a 
new theory for the Decline and Fall of Rome! 
To acquire definitely any characteristic such as the 
ability to think constructively, or to solve problems, or to 
run fast, we require first of all, a good organism. Next, 
except in case of prodigies we require exercise of the or- 
gans, and for this we require a third factor — time. When 
we have these characteristics we may transmit them to 
our progeny, according to Redfield’s statistics. Opposed 
to this is the theory that prodigies are the descendants of 
prodigies, but it is becoming more and more evident that 
wisdom will in time weave both conflicting theories into 
an harmonious whole. And, despite the many books to 
the contrary, it appears that the original prodigy is invari- 
ably the product of struggle and effort —in short, of 
exercise, by its forbears. The right conditions and exer- 
cise will produce the desired qualities in a short time, in 
good strains, but it takes many generations to effect this 
with inferior strains. The advantage of being born late in 
the lives of parents and grandparents who are diligent in 
the exercise of their faculties is indicated by an amazing 
array of examples. 
It is probable, however, that a considerable array of 
examples might be brought forward and prove the con- 
trary. 
We recognize the persistence of types, but we are coming 
to the conclusion that types are subject to both develop- 
ment and deterioration. It is becoming more and more 
evident that everyone is a trustee of his inheritance, and 
that this may be modified for good or for evil before it is  
-P-A-G-E-120
114 CHANGING VIEWS OF EVOLUTION 
passed on. It appears that the progeny of early matings 
in the human family are less to be wished for than the 
children of more mature parents. 
Evolution is a vast system of philosophy. There is far 
more that we don’t know about it than we do; therefore we 
meet contradictions and difficulties on every hand. But it 
is a wholesome and inspiring vision, because it reveals to 
us our obligations. It leads to profound reverence, but 
it does not adjust itself yet to symbols. It may not be 
summed up in the slogan that man is descended from apes, 
any more than religion may be summed up in the pro- 
hibition of alcoholic beverages. 
Evolution teaches that we can breed any quality into or 
out of afamily. It teaches that blood will tell, but it does 
not rule out the question: What are we doing to the blood 
within us? This will not remain constant throughout 
generations; it improves or it deteriorates and the respon- 
sibility for this is upon every one of us as individuals, for 
we pass on to the next generation what we have. 
The demand for plenty of cheap and feeble-minded labor 
to do hard but simple manual work does not accord with 
this philosophy. Such importations may cost future gener- 
ations far more than they benefit us. The professionally 
unemployed in England were found by General Booth to be 
capable of two days’ work a week, but no more. These 
are the descendants of early industrial workers who toiled 
from eleven to fourteen hours a day, and the strain was 
injured by overwork. It will require generations to restore 
the breed. We also injure the breed of the men who work 
for us when we press them to the verge of nervous collapse 
by factory systems that rob them of the chance of interest 
in their work. Evolution teaches also that idleness is a 
leading source of degeneracy; that every man and woman 
should have the opportunity to improve the strain of his 
or her own inheritance, and that there is no great onward
-P-A-G-E-121
  ELLWOOD HENDRICK 1 
and upward surge unless we strive intelligently to bring it 
about. 
The great need of humanity in these days of wrath and 
selfishness and malice is religion. We need above all 
things a sense of divinity to enliven our consciousness of 
our obligations. Among those who think, some are so con- 
structed, or have been so trained, that divinity is only 
made sensible through special acts of creation. Others are 
differently constructed, and they sense divinity within 
nature rather than external to it. There is no issue of 
integrity or of character between these two schools. But, 
however we do it, we must see the light for ourselves, other- 
wise we shall live in darkness with no alternative save of 
denial of hypocrisy, if freedom to seek the light is for- 
bidden. The widespread propaganda of to-day to forbid 
the teaching of the theory of evolution, is more than a 
denial of rights; it denies to free men and women the op- 
portunity to seek their obligations in order that they may 
fulfill them.

  SCIENCE AND MODERN THOUGHT! 
J. ARTHUR THOMSON 
No one will be inclined to set limits to man’s understanding 
but it is useful to recognize that science as we know it is 
subject to certain limitations. (1) There is a self-imposed 
limitation in the fact that science applies its methods to 
abstracted aspects of things. We cannot intellectually 
separate a living creature from its surroundings any more 
than we can separate a whirlpool from the river, yet for 
biological purposes we continually think the fish away 
from the sea and the bird from the air. In analytical 
anatomy it is actually profitable to do so. Even in more 
exact sciences this limitation operates. In dynamics we 
treat the mass of a body as if we studied the body under 
the influence of gravitation only. But in actual observa- 
tions and experiments we can never secure the entire ab- 
sence of electrical, magnetic, and other energies. In other 
words, science works with “ideal systems”; it aims at 
practically convenient representations of certain aspects of 
facts, deliberately abstracted from other aspects. 
(2) Science works with “‘counters” or concepts which are 
in various degrees far from being self-explanatory. What 
mysteries lie behind the terms “‘organism,” “‘ protoplasm,” 
“heredity,” “energy,” “chemical affinity,” “gravitation,” 
“inertia,” “matter”! It is admitted that the analysis of 
concepts proceeds apace and that the number of “irredu- 
cibles” grows less. But there are many “‘2’s” left. 
(3) Another limitation has to do with causal sequence. 
One billiard ball strikes another — a releasing cause; the 
relaxed spring turns the cylinder of the gramophone, and 29 66

tesy of G. P. Putnam’s Sons, publishers, New York and London.

  J. ARTHUR THOMSON 117 
there is music. But it is only in the first case that the cause 
explains the effect; in the other cases the effect is more or 
less given in advance. In the great majority of cases all 
that science does is to say: “If this, then that.” Its causal 
explanations are usually very partial. 
(4) Another limitation concerns origins, which remain 
mysteries. The biologist begins with the first organisms, 
but whence came they? The chemist begins with the 
elements, but what has been their history? There is al- 
ways something before the beginning with which the scien- 
tific investigator starts and must start. So there are limi- 
tations implied in the partial view we have to take in 
prosecuting a scientific inquiry, in the radical mysterious- 
ness of the counters we use, in the difficulty of giving com- 
plete causal explanations except in the field of mechanics, 
and likewise in the obscurity of origins. If these necessary 
limitations were more clearly kept in mind the aim and 
scope of science would be less frequently misunderstood. 
Moreover, besides all these limitations there are others 
of a different kind — imposed on us by the limits of our 
sense-organs, even when greatly helped by ingenious in- 
struments, and by the narrow limits of exact data in regard 
to the past. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that 
formule or laws which seemed for a time to fit well have 
often had to undergo readjustment with the increase of 
knowledge and the recognition of residual phenomena. 
So Kepler improves on Copernicus, and Newton on Kepler, 
and Einstein, some say, on Newton. Science may be 
compared to an asymptotic line, which is always approach- 
ing nearer and nearer to some curve but never reaching it 
except at infinite distance. Sometimes a single discovery 
may change the whole framework of a science. Thus 
Professor Soddy, speaking of radio-activity, says: 
It sounds incredible, but nevertheless it is true that science up 
to the close of the nineteenth century had no suspicion even of the
-P-A-G-E-124
  118 SCIENCE AND MODERN THOUGHT 
existence of the original sources of natural energy. The vista 
which has been opened up by these new discoveries (of the radio- 
active properties of some substances) admittedly is without par- 
allel in the whole history of science. 
And sometimes it is a new idea, like that of organic evolu- 
tion, which changes the whole outlook of a science and 
makes the world new. 
Finally, according to well-warranted scientific belief 
there was once a time when all that happened upon the 
earth might have been formulated with apparent ex- 
haustiveness in terms of matter and motion. But ages 
passed and living creatures emerged — a new synthesis, 
requiring new formule. Ages passed and intelligent crea- 
tures commanded their course; a new aspect of reality 
required anew science. Ages passed and Man emerged — 
with self-consciousness, language, reasoning capacity, and 
a social heritage. As the world grew older, the biosphere 
emerged from the cosmosphere, and out of the biosphere 
there emerged the sociosphere. As long as its subject- 
matter continues evolving in the direction of new integra- 
tions, science must also evolve. 
Science AND FEELING 
Our life is like a prism: its three sides are (1) Doing, 
(2) Feeling, and (3) Knowing, corresponding to the old- 
fashioned Hand, Heart, and Head. Each is a doorway 
out — (1) to the world of action; (2) to the world of art, 
music, religious ritual, literature, and (3) to the world of 
externally registered thinking, from a stone circle to a 
nautical almanac, from a map to a census, from a calendar 
to a chemical balance. Men are happily of diverse moods: 
(1) Some have “a practical turn of mind,” with a patho- 
logical extreme in “matter-of-factness” and “materialism,” 
but are essentially men of action, who make things hum 
and get things done. (2) Some are “men of feeling,”
-P-A-G-E-125
  
J. ARTHUR THOMSON 119 
going out by the emotional doorway with a pathological 
extreme in “‘sentimentalism,” but essentially men of artis- 
tic insight, and sometimes, as poets and seers, the makers 
and shakers of this world of ours. (3) Some are predomi- 
nantly men of intellect, who “elect to know, not do,” who 
discover causes, uniformities, laws, and who try to think 
things out. The pathological extreme “botanizes on his 
mother’s grave,” as Wordsworth put it, and gibes at 
“proud philosophy,” but there is no doubt that the makers 
of new knowledge have transformed human life, giving it 
a new freedom and fulness. 
Every intellectual combatant seeks more or less resolutely 
to gain an all-round or synoptic view of his experience, and 
this is his philosophy. Our present point is that this must 
be for most men in a large degree a matter of temperament, 
according as the practical, the emotional, or the scientific 
mood is dominant. To return to the old-fashioned Hand, 
Heart, and Head, these are not only doorways out, they 
are portals in. For life is like a dome, always with its 
concave and convex side, subjective as well as objective. 
Thus there is the inner world of appetencies and “urges,” 
desires and ideals, which lead externally to action; the 
world of feelings and emotions which lead to art; and the 
world of intellectual experimentation which has its external 
expression in, let us say, the archives of science. All these 
are natural and necessary expressions of the developing 
human spirit, and it is in the deepest sense unphilosophical 
to pit one against the other, or to make antitheses between 
the different glimpses of reality which are to be obtained 
from each of the three great doorways of our being. 
Truly, science as science is unemotional and impersonal, 
and its analytic, atomizing, or anatomizing methods are apt, 
in their matter-of-factness, to seem antagonistic to artistic 
unities and poetical interpretations. But here must be 
learned the lesson of patience and open-mindedness, and  
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 SCIENCE AND MODERN THOUGHT 
here the limitations of science must be borne in mind. The 
poetry of the man of feeling must not contradict the formu- 
lations of the man of science, but they are speaking differ- 
ent languages, and we may know by feeling some aspect of 
reality which eludes us in scientific analysis. Our delight 
in fine scenery is not less real than our knowledge of the 
geology. Both pathways to reality. 
When science makes minor mysteries disappear, greater 
mysteries stand confessed. For one object of delight whose 
emotional value science has inevitably lessened — as New- 
ton damaged the rainbow for Keats — science gives back 
double. To the grand primary impressions of the world 
power, the immensities, the pervading order, and the uni- 
versal flux, with which the man of feeling has been nurtured 
from of old, modern science has added thrilling impressions 
of manifoldness, intricacy, uniformity, inter-relatedness, 
and evolution. Science widens and clears the emotional 
window. ‘There are great vistas to which science alone 
can lead, and they make for elevation of mind. The op- 
position between science and feeling is largely a misunder- 
standing. As one of our philosophers has remarked, 
science is in a true sense “one of the humanities.” 
Screncr AnD RELIGION 
Science seeks to discover the laws of concrete being and 
becoming and to state these in the simplest possible terms. 
These terms are either the immediate data of experience or 
verifiably derived from these. Religion, on the other hand, 
implies a recognition — practical, emotional, and intel- 
lectual — of a higher order of reality than is reached in 
sense-experience. It sees an unseen universe, which throws 
light on the riddles of the observed world. Its language is 
not scientific language and the two cannot be spoken at 
once. The concepts of religion are transcendental, those 
of science are empirical. The aim of religion is interpre-
-P-A-G-E-127
  J. ARTHUR THOMSON 121 
tation, not description. Religious interpretation and 
scientific description must not be inconsistent, but they 
are incommensurable. This is not falling back on the 
impossible solution of having idea-tight compartments; 
what is meant is that while the form of a religious idea, of 
Creation, let us say, must be congruent with the established 
scientific system, scientific description and religious inter- 
pretation work in two quite different “universes of dis- 
course.” : 
Scrence AnD PHILosopHy 
The philosophical outlook is synoptic; an all-round 
view. In other words, a philosophical system is the out- 
come of interpretative reflection on the whole data of our 
experience. Science and philosophy are,complementary. 
To the scientific thinker philosophy is of service in helping 
him to recognize the limitations of his task and the assump- 
tions with which he starts. It may save him from being 
easygoing in the criticism of his categories. On the other 
side, a modern philosophy must take account of all the far- 
reaching results of scientific inquiry. Thus an adequate 
interpretative system must have been receptive to all the 
influences of such conclusions as the principle of the con- 
servation of energy, the doctrine of organic evolution, and 
the outstanding facts of heredity. Philosophy has of 
course no right to call the tune which it wishes science to 
play, but its task is to correlate the conclusions of science 
with those which may be reached in the course of practi- 
cal, ethical, esthetic, or religious experience. Philosophy 
begins where the experimental and observational sciences 
leave off, but it does not follow that philosophy in its 
edifice must use the building-stones just as science hands 
them over. It is here that philosophical criticism and all- 
roundness must come in. Thus the results of the modern 
study of heredity need not be accepted in a form so crude
-P-A-G-E-128
  122 SCIENCE AND MODERN THOUGHT 
that the inevitable outcome is fatalism; the results of 
modern bio-chemistry need not be accepted in a form so 
partial that they confine us to a mechanistic view of the 
living creature; the results of the modern study of animal 
behavior need not be accepted in a form so one sided 
that it practically rules “mind” out of court. These are 
merely examples of the opportunities which philosophy has 
for a criticism of scientific categories — a task for which 
the majority of scientific investigators is poorly equipped. 
To take another illustration, the principle of the conser- 
vation of energy, formulated in reference to the trans- 
formations that go on in physical experiments, must not 
be allowed to foreclose discussion of the question whether 
“mind” and “body” (if these be recognized as admissible 
scientific or philosophical terms) can interact in a way 
that really counts. And the answer given to that question, 
or to some similar question more satisfactorily phrased, 
affects the general philosophical or metaphysical theory 
that one holds in regard to the world as a whole and man 
in particular. 
Similarly, when philosophy takes over from the biologist 
the formula of organic evolution that the present is the 
child of the past and the parent of the future, it is bound to 
scrutinize the concept of evolution and to show that it is 
no easy one; and it is bound to make very clear the differ- 
ence between accepting the modal formula (indicative of 
the general mode by which the present biosphere has come 
about) and accepting any particular statement of the fac- 
tors in the age-long process. The general fact of evolution 
stands firmer than ever; but inquiry into the factors is still 
relatively young. 
Scrence AND Lirn 
The primary purpose of science is understanding, but 
knowledge is power. As Bacon said:  
-P-A-G-E-129
  
J. ARTHUR THOMSON 128 
‘The end of our foundation (Salomon’s House) is the knowledge 
of causes and the secret motions of things; and the enlarging of 
the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible. 
The two aspects are hardly separable. All the sciences, 
including mathematics, sprang from concrete experience of 
practical problems, and the most theoretical investigations 
have made the biggest differences in man’s everyday life 
to-day. Wireless telegraphy, the telephone, aeroplanes, 
radium, antiseptics, antitoxins, spectrum analysis and 
X-rays were all discovered in the course of abstractly 
scientific researches. If the utilitarian criterion is pressed 
in a short-sighted way, then, as to results, it defeats itself. 
And apart from this consideration, itself utilitarian, it is 
profitable to return to Bacon’s distinction between those 
results of science which are of direct practical utility 
(fructifere) and those which are light-giving (lucifera) — a 
distinction which led to the admirable deliverance: 
Just as the vision of light itself is something more excellent and 
beautiful than its manifold use, so without doubt the contempla- 
tion of things as they are, without superstition or imposture, 
without error or confusion, is in itself a nobler thing than a whole 
harvest of inventions. 
The old discouragement expressed in the saying that 
increase of knowledge is increase of sorrow has been re- 
placed by a more robust confidence in what science may 
achieve in the control of life. The modern outlook is ex- 
pressed in Herbert Spencer’s pithy sentence: “Science is 
for Life, not Life for Science”; or in Comte’s well-known 
saying: “‘ Knowledge is Foresight and Foresight is Power.” 
Bacon had the idea clearly in mind when he wrote in 
The Advancement of Learning: “This is that which will 
indeed dignify and exalt knowledge if comtemplation and 
action be more nearly and straitly conjoined and united 
together than they have been.” And the passage ends by 
declaring that what is sought in science should be “a rich
-P-A-G-E-130
124 SCIENCE AND MODERN THOUGHT 
storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of 
man’s estate.” But what is distinctively modern is the 
ideal of bringing the light of science to bear on man’s 
problems all along the line, on health of mind as well as of 
body, on education as well as on agriculture, on ethical 
development as well as on the more economical exploita- 
tion and usage of natural resources, on eugenics as well as 
on eutopias. Just as many ills that the flesh is heir to are 
met no longer with folded hands, but by confident thera- 
peutics, so over a wide range there is a promiseful applica- 
tion of all kinds of science to the amelioration of the con- 
ditions of human life. Great stores of wealth are awaiting 
the scientific “Open Sesame”; a great heightening of the 
standard of health will be attainable in a few generations 
if men of good-will take science as their torch. But 
wealth and health are the pre-conditions of true progress, 
which means a fuller embodiment of the true, the beautiful, 
and the good in lives which are increasingly a satisfaction 
in themselves.

WHAT IS AMERICAN LITERATURE?! 
BRANDER MATTHEWS : 
I 
Ir was in the ninth decade of the nineteenth century that 
a British historian of the expansion of the British race pro- 
claimed boldly the permanent unity of the several peoples 
who have English for their mother-tongue despite whatever 
political severance may have taken place. When John 
Richard Green came to record the revolt of the American 
colonies from British rule and the establishment of the in- 
dependence of the United States he asserted that since 
1776 “the life of the English people has flowed not in one 
current, but in two; and while the older has shown little 
sign of lessening, the younger has fast risen to a greatness 
which has changed the face of the world. In wealth and 
material energy, as in numbers, it far surpasses the mother- 
country from which it sprang. It is already the main 
branch of the English people; and in the days that are at 
hand the main current of that people’s history must run 
along the channel, not of the Thames or the Mersey, but of 
the Hudson and the Mississippi.” 
If an American had penned this eloquent paragraph, he 
would have laid himself open to the charge of boastfulness; 
and even when an American merely quotes it, he has the 
uneasy feeling that he may be indulging in a specimen of 
that vainglorious “‘tall talk” which was once unduly pre- 
valent in the juvenile United States. Yet it is well that the 
facts in the case should be stated thus clearly by a British

author of high authority, for these facts are often forgotten 
or at least overlooked by other men of letters both British 
and American. It is useful, and indeed it is needful, for us 
_all on both sides of the Atlantic to be reminded now and 
again that the people of the British Isles and the immense 
majority of the people of the United States come of the 
same stocks, speak the same language, and possess in com- 
mon the same literature. 
By the aid of an association of scholars, mainly British 
but occasionally American, the long story of the develop- 
ment of English literature in the British Isles has been nar- 
rated in detail in the fourteen volumes of the Cambridge 
History; and now there have been added four volumes 
setting forth the far briefer story of its development in the 
United States. These four additional volumes deal ex- 
clusively with that subdivision of English literature which 
is naturally and necessarily known as American literature, 
but which in spite of its separatist name is none the less an 
integral part of English literature not to be omitted from 
any attempt at a comprehensive survey of the whole. 
Unfortunately, more than one American historian of the 
later literature which has come into being in the United 
States and more than one British historian of the earlier 
literature which was born in the British Isles, have chosen 
to deal with these unequal portions of English literature as 
though they were each of them self-contained entities in no 
wise related to one another, thus apparently setting what 
must be termed American literature in opposition to English 
literature, of which it is only a subdivision. i Yet to detach , 
American literature from English literature is to deny the 
essential unity of the literature of our language. 
0 
pte ought to be obvious that the literature of any lan 
guage is one and indivisible. It ought therefore to be in-
-P-A-G-E-135
  BRANDER MATTHEWS 129 
disputable ithat no book of recognized literary merit, no 
book in which we discover the twin qualities of style and of 
substance, can fairly be omitted from any complete con- 
ideration of the literature of the language in which it was , 
composed, regardless of the nativity or the citizenship of 
its author or of any political separation which may have 
taken place between the several peoples. who possess that 
language in common. It is an unfortunate fact, however, 
that now and again we do find American books and Ameri- 
can authors omitted from histories of English literature, 
although we fail to find any corresponding exclusion in 
the histories of any other literature, even when the circum- 
stances seem to be similar, not to say identical. 
For example, no historian of Greek literature has ever 
ventured to pass over Theocritus, although that Syracusan 
idyllist owed no allegiance to any Greek state, and althouglt 
he may never have set foot on the soil of Greece; and no 
historian of French literature has ever hesitated to consider 
the work and the influence of Madame de Staél, who was 
Swiss by birth, who was Scandinavian by marriage, and 
who was long exiled from France. For these historians of 
Greek and of French literature it was sufficient that Theo- 
critus wrote in Greek and that Madame de Staél wrote in 
French. The alien Theocritus may be solitary in Greek 
literature, but the alien Madame de Staél has a host of 
parallels in French literature. 
Every historian of the development of literary art in 
France discusses in turn Saint Francis de Sales, who was 
a subject of Savoy and who refused to become a French- 
man, the Scot Anthony Hamilton, the Swiss Rousseau, the 
German Grimm, and the Italian Galiani. When the author 
of a manual of French literature comes to the nineteenth 
century, he pays attention, proportionate to their individ- 
ual importance, to the writings of the brothers de Maistre 
who were born in Savoy, of M. Maurice Maeterlinck who
-P-A-G-E-136
  130 WHAT IS AMERICAN LITERATURE? 
was born in Belgium, of Louis Fréchette who was born in 
Canada, and of M. Viele-Griffin who was born in the United 
States. Moreover, Petit de Julleville and Brunetiére were 
led logically by this inclusion of alien authors who wrote 
French to the exclusion of French authors who wrote only 
in Latin, Abélard and Saint Bernard, de Thou, Scaliger, 
and Casaubon. It is perhaps even more significant that 
“the new Library of Spanish Authors comprehends only 
writers of Castilian “including, of course, those born in the 
Spanish-American republics,” and yet excluding the na- 
tive Spaniards who wrote in Catalan. 
In spite of the admirable example thus set by these 
foreign scholars who recognize the essential unity of the 
literature of any language, it is not unusual to find British 
historians of English literature who bestow ample space 
upon the French poems of Chaucer and the Latin poems of 
Milton, and yet who deny any consideration to the essays 
of Emerson, the romances of Hawthorne, and the poetry of 
Poe and Whitman composed in the English language, the 
mother-tongue of Whitman and Poe, of Hawthorne and 
Emerson, as it was the mother-tongue of Milton and of 
Chaucer. 
Tm 
Probably the explanation of these occasional departures 
from the precedent accepted as imperative by the historian 
of every other literature must be sought in the unprece- 
dented relation of the United States to Great Britain. For + 
the first time in the world’s history a group of colonies 
having achieved its independence of the mother-country 
and having organized itself into a separate nation, has 
gone on its own way and followed its own destiny until at 
last its population has come to outnumber that of the 
parent islands two to one. And this immense increase of 
population in the United States has not been derived ex-
-P-A-G-E-137
  BRANDER MATTHEWS 181 
clusively from the British Isles or even from the kindred 
stocks out of which the British population was originally 
recruited. As a result of this development and of this 
divergence the Americans and the British are at once alike 
and unlike; and perhaps both parties are more acutely con- 
scious of the points of dissimilarity than of the points of 
similarity. The inhabitants of Great Britain and the in- 
habitants of the United States know themselves to be the 
same and yet not the same. They are the same in that the 
Americans have inherited the language, the laws and the 
political ideals which the British had earlier evolved. They 
are not the same in that the Americans, having governed 
themselves for now nearly a century and a half, have had 
to solve their own problems in their own fashion in their 
own continent, while the British in their group of islands 
have acquired a mighty empire and have had to confront 
difficulties very different from those which rose before their 
former colonists. 
As a result of these dissimilar necessities the British and 
the Americans have developed each in their own direction 
and they have grown apart in spite of their retention of a - 
common language-and of the common law. They are two 
great nations, rivals in discovery and invention, rivals in 
the arts, rivals in commerce and in finance. They are 
friendly rivals, no doubt, and they do not feel that latent 
hostility toward each other which they may feel toward 
those who speak foreign tongues; there has been a hundred 
years of peace between them; and another war is unthink- 
able. None the less is each of them acutely conscious of 
its own independent nationality and jealous of its own in- 
dividuality. It is small wonder, then, that writers on one 
side of the Atlantic or on the other lacking in insight into 
fundamental facts, should sometimes be tempted to segre- 
gate American literature and to set it apart by itself. We 
may even doubt whether the historians of French literature
-P-A-G-E-138
ee ee ON ae 
182 WHAT IS AMERICAN LITERATURE? 
would have been so unhesitatingly cordial to the Swiss and 
to the Belgian authors who had French for their sole means 
of communicating with the rest of the world, if Switzer- 
land now surpassed France in population and if Belgium 
now exceeded it in power. 
While the Americans of to-day are still English in many 
ways they are in no wise British; and even the original 
immigrants, Cavaliers in Virginia 4nd Pilgrims in Massa- 
chusetts, right Elizabethans as they were, suffered a sea 
change speedily and became subdued to what they lived 
in. Nevertheless, from the very beginning they held fast 
to their birthright in the English law, in the English lan- 
guage and in English literature. To these traditions they 
were ever loyal; and even when they rose against the agents 
of the British King, they held themselves children of 
Chaucer, subjects of Shakspere, heirs of Milton. Even 
though they dwell under alien skies, with the thousand 
leagues of the Western Ocean between the broad new land 
and the old island home of the race, they have always 
claimed Chaucer and Shakspere and Milton as theirs by 
heritage, denying any assertion of primogeniture which 
might disinherit them. They have had a stalwart satis- 
faction in their ownership of English literature as a whole; 
and their descendants of to-day refuse sturdily to be put 
off with a younger brother’s portion. 
\ Iv 
\ While we Americans have ever gloried in our inheritance 
of English literature we have also had a natural pride in 
our own authors and in that native literature which’ began 
tentatively in the eighteenth century, which revealed itself 
more amply in the nineteenth, and which possesses un- 
known possibilities of expansion in the twentieth.) When 
Matthew Arnold suggested to Sainte-Beuve that Lamar- 
tine was not an important poet, the wise French critic re-

plied, “He is important to us.” Certain American poets 
and certain American prose masters are important to us 
Americans, even if we are well aware that they may be less 
important to our kin across the sea. Though they may 
fail to prove their ultimate significance when measured by 
the universal and permanent standards, none the less they 
have special significance for us, whose struggles they, have 
recorded and whose hopes they have shared. ~ iivery* 
race,” said Brunetiére in his history of French lit “ure, 
“is the judge — and must be the only judge — of ..s own 
poets Thusit is that Racine and Lamartine, for example, 
are justifiably rated far higher by their own countrymen 
than would be warranted by a truly cosmopolitan examina- 
tion of their works. 
To hold the scales even and to weigh the American men of 
letters, one after another, with the weights which have 
international validity, is a task as delicate as it is difficult. 
Yet it is a little less difficult to-day — even if it is not less 
delicate — than it was a century ago, when Sydney Smith 
was asking “Who reads an American book?” Previous to 
the appearance of the “Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon” 
and of the “Spy,” the accepted belief that a great nation 
ought to have great poets, and that the United States 
ought to be endowed at once with a literature commensurate 
with the expanse of the country, had lured more than one 
native bard, possest of aspiration rather than inspiration, 
into the concoction of ponderous epics, to be read by title 
only. : 
This was a manifestation of provincialism, of the desire 
of a locality on the circumference to demand equality with 
the spot in the center of things. Provincialism may be ' 
defined as an uneasy self-assertion supported by faith but 
not justified by works. It was painfully prevalent in the 
United States in the first half of the nineteenth century; 
and it was sharply satirized by Lowell in an often quoted 
passage of the Fable for Critics:  
-P-A-G-E-140

Why, there’s scarcely a huddle of log-huts and shanties

In short, if a man has the luck to have any sons,

And in these same earlier decades of the last century there 
was to be observed by the side of the self-assertion of pro- 
vincialism the self-abasing attitude of colonialism, of the 
inability to see our own except through spectacles belonging 
to British critics. Colonialism may be defined as a timid 
deference to the opinion of the mother country and as a 
blank disbelief that anything good can come out of our 
own. Lowell, though he did not call it by name, could not 
fail to perceive this colonialism as clearly as he saw the 
provincialism; and he hit at it in his contemptuous dis- 
missal of the writing that 
suits each whisper and motion 
To what will be thought of it over the ocean. 
Vv 
Now, at last, in these opening decades of the twentieth 
century it is possible for native historians of the American 
branch of English literature to discuss it, if not with abso- 
lute detachment, at least dispassionately, avoiding alike 
the arrogance of provincialism and the humility of colonial- 
ism. The task is not easy even now, because the expan- 
sion of literature is relatively so recent in the United States, 
that we shall lack yet awhile the perspective of time, which 
is unerring in assigning the exalted positions to the authors 
of most importance and of most significance. By holding 
fast to cosmopolitan standards we may save ourselves any
-P-A-G-E-141
  BRANDER MATTHEWS 135 
temptation to take a native goose for a Swan of Avon and 
to liken our mocking-birds to the alien nightingale. There , 
is not likely to be any lamentable failure of justice, if the 
several contributors to a record of the development of 
English literature here in the United States strive honestly 
to ascertain the exact position of our leading authors, first 
of all in American literature itself, second in English litera- 
ture as a whole, and thirdly and finally in the larg . litera- 
ture of the world, present and past. 
Thirty years ago the distinguished Spanish scholar who 
had been representing his native land at Washington, 
paused in New York on his way home and wrote a prefa- 
tory note to the American translation of his delightful 
novel Pepita Ximenez. In this suggestive and stimulating 
letter of introduction to the American reading public, the 
Spanish author-diplomat took occasion to insist upon the 
essential. unity of the literature of any language and to 
dwell upon the necessary recognition of American litera- 
ture as an integral part of English literature. Yet he paid 
us the compliment of remarking that we Americans had 
brought to the common fund of the English-speaking 
peoples and to the culture of the race “‘rich elements, fine 
traits of character, and perhaps even higher qualities.” 
He hoped for a favorable reception of his translated tale, 
because he had observed in “‘this American literature, of 
English origin and language, a certain largeness of view, a 
certain cosmopolitanism and affectionate comprehension of 
what is foreign, which is as broad as the continent that the 
Americans inhabit and which forms a contrast to the 
narrow exclusiveness of the insular British.” 
It must be noted that Don Juan Valera had earlier 
warned us that it was a delusion of national vanity to be- 
lieve that there is or ever will be, ‘“‘anything that with legit-

186 WHAT IS AMERICAN LITERATURE? 
Greece diffused herself throughout the world in flourish- 
ing colonies, founded powerful states in Egypt, in Syria, 
and even in Bactriana, among peoples who, unlike the 
American Indians, possessed a high civilization of their 
own. But, notwithstanding this dispersion and_ this 
political severance from the mother-country, the literature 
of Syracuse, of Antioch and of Alexandria, was as much 
Greek literature as was the literature of Athens. For the 
same reason the literature of New York and Boston will 
continue to be as much English literature as the literature 
of London and Edinburgh; the literature of Mexico and 
Buenos Ayres will continue to be as much Spanish litera- 
ture as the literature of Madrid; the literature of Rio 
Janeiro will be as much Portuguese literature as the litera- 
ture of Lisbon. Political union may be severed, but, be- 
tween peoples of the same tongue and of the same race, the 
ties of spiritual fraternity are indissoluble, so long as their 
common civilization lasts. There are immortal kings or 
emperors who reign and rule in America by true divine 
right and against whom no Washington or Bolivar shall 
prevail and from whom no Franklin can snatch the sceptre. 
These tyrants are named’ Cervantes, Shakspere, and 
Camoéns.

A CERTAIN CONDESCENSION TOWARD 
FICTION ! 
HENRY S. CANBY 
Ir only the reader of novels would say what he thinks about 
fiction! If only the dead hand of hereditary opinion did 
not grasp and distort what he feels! But he exercises a 
judgment that is not independent. Books, like persons, he 
estimates as much by the traditional reputation of the 
families they, happen to be born in as by the merits they 
may themselves possess, and the traditional reputation of 
the novel in English has been bad. 
Poetry has a most respectable tradition. Even now, 
when the realistic capering of free verse has emboldened 
the ordinary man to speak his mind freely, a reviewer 
hesitates to apply even to bad poetry so undignified a word 
as trash. The essay family is equally respectable, to be 
noticed, when noticed at all, with some of the reverence 
due to an ancient and dignified art. The sermon family, 
still numerous to a degree incredible to those who do not 
study the lists of new books, is so eminently respectable 
that few dare to abuse even its most futile members. But 
the novel was given a bad name in its youth that has over- 
shadowed its successful maturity. 
Our ancestors are much to blame. For centuries they 
held the novel suspect as a kind of bastard literature, 
probably immoral, and certainly dangerous to intellectual 
health. But they are no more deeply responsible for our 
suppressed contempt of fiction than weak-kneed novelists 
who for many generations have striven to persuade the 
English reader that a good story was really a sermon, or a

  138 CONDESCENSION TOWARD FICTION 
lecture on ethics, or a tract on economics or moral psy- 
chology, in disguise. Bernard Shaw, in his prefaces to 
the fiction that he succeeds in making dramatic, is carrying 
on a tradition that Chaucer practiced before him: 
And ye that holden this tale a folye, — 
As of a fox, or of a cok and hen, — 
Taketh the moralite, good men. 
And that was the way they went at it for centuries, always 
pretending, always driven to pretend that a good story 
was not good enough to be worth telling for itself alone, 
but must convey a moral or a satire or an awful lesson, or 
anything that might separate it from the “‘just fiction” 
that only the immoral and the frivolous among their con- 
temporaries read or wrote. ‘To-day we pay the price. 
William Painter, her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s clerk of 
ordnance in the Tower, is an excellent instance. Stricken 
by a moral panic, he advertised that from his delectable 
“Palace of Pleasure” the young might “‘learne how to 
avoyde the ruine, overthrow, inconvenience and despleas- 
ure, that lascivious desire and wanton evil doth bring to 
their suters and pursuers” — a disingenuous sop to the 
Puritans. His contemporary, Geoffrey Fenton, who also 
turned to story-making, opines that in histories “the 
dignitye of vertue and fowelenes of vice appereth muche 
more lyvelye then in any morall teachynge,” although he 
knew that his “‘histories” were the sheerest, if not the 
purest, of fiction, with any moral purpose that might exist 
chiefly of his own creating. A century and more later 
Eliza Haywood, the ambiguous author of many ambiguous 
novels of the eighteenth century, prefaces her Life’s Prog- 
ress Through the Passions (an ambiguous title) with like 
hypocrisy: “I am enemy to all romances, novels, and what- 
ever carries the air of them.... It is a real, not a fictitious 
character I am about to present” — which is merely
-P-A-G-E-145
HENRY S. CANBY 139 
another instance of fiction disguising itself, this time, I re- 
gret to say, as immorality in real life. And so they all go, 
forever implying that fiction is frivolous or immoral or 
worthless, until it is not surprising that, as Mr. Bradsher 
has reminded us, the elder Timothy Dwight of Yale College 
was able to assert, “Between the Bible and novels there is 
a gulf fixed which few novel-readers are willing to pass.” 
Richardson was forced to defend himself, so was Sterne, so 
was Fielding, so was Goldsmith. Dr. Johnson was evidently 
making concessions when he advised romances as reading 
for youth. Jeffrey, the critic and tyrant of the next cen- 
tury, summed it all up when he wrote that novels are “‘gen- 
erally regarded as among the lower productions of our 
literature.” And this is the reputation that the novel 
family has brought with it even down to our day. 
The nineteenth century was worse, if anything, than 
earlier periods, for it furthered what might be called the 
evangelistic slant toward novel-reading, the attitude that 
neatly classified this form of self-indulgence with dancing, 
card-playing, hard drinking, and loose living of every 
description. It is true that the intellectuals and worldly 
folk in general did not share this prejudice. Walter Scott 
had made novel-reading common among the well-read; 
but the narrower sectarians in England, the people of the 
back country and the small towns in America, learned to 
regard the novel as unprofitable, if not positively leading 
toward ungodliness, and their unnumbered descendants 
make up the vast army of uncritical readers for which 
Grub Street strives and sweats to-day. They no longer 
abstain and condemn; instead they patronize and distrust. 
All this — and far more, for I have merely sketched in a 
long and painful history — is the background seldom re- 
membered when we wonder at the easy condescension of 
the American toward his innumerable novels. 
The fact of his condescension is not so well recognized as
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 CONDESCENSION TOWARD FICTION 
it deserves to be. Indeed, condescension may not seem to 
be an appropriate term for the passionate devouring of 
romance that one can see going on any day in the trolley- 
cars, or the tense seriousness with which some readers re- 
gard certain novelists whose pages have a message for the 
world. True, the term will not stretch thus far. But it is 
condescension that has made the trouble, as I shall try to 
prove; for all of us, even the tense ones, do patronize that 
creative instinct playing upon life as it is which in all times 
and everywhere is the very essence of fiction. 
How absurd that here in America we should condescend 
toward our fiction! How ridiculous in a country even yet 
so weak and poor and crude in the arts, which has contribu- 
ted so little to the world’s store of all that makes fine living 
for the mind! What a laughable parallel of the cock and the 
gem he found and left upon the dung-heap, if we could be 
proved not to be proud of American fiction! For if the 
novel and the short story should be left out of America’s 
slender contribution to world literature, the offering would 
be a small one. Some poetry of Whitman’s and of Poe’s, 
some essays of Emerson, a little of Thoreau, and what im- 
portant besides? Hawthorne would be left from the count, 
the best exemplar of the fine art of moral narrative in any 
language; Henry James would be left out, the master of 
them all in psychological character analysis; Poe the story- 
teller would be missing, and the art of the modern short 
story, which in English stems from him; Cooper would be 
lost from our accounting, for all his crudities the best his- 
torical novelist after Scott; Mark Twain, Howells, Bret 
Harte, Irving! The attempt to exalt American literature 
is grateful if one begins upon fiction. 
And how absurd to patronize, to treat with indifferent 
superiority just because they are members of the novel 
family, books such as both men and women are writing in 
America to-day! Is there finer workmanship in American
-P-A-G-E-147
  HENRY S. CANBY 141 
painting or American music or American architecture than 
ean be found in American novels by the reader willing to 
search and discriminate? A contemporary poet confessed 
that he would rather have written a certain sonnet (which 
accompanied the confession) than have built Brooklyn 
Bridge. One may doubt the special case, yet uphold the 
principle. Because a novel is meant to give pleasure, be- 
cause it deals with imagination rather than with facts and 
appeals to the generality rather than to the merely literary 
man or the specialist, because, in short, a novel is a novel, 
and a modern American novel, is no excuse for priggish 
reserves in our praise or blame. If there is anything worth 
criticizing in contemporary American literature it is our 
fiction. 
Absurd as it may seem in theory, we have patronized 
and do patronize our novels, even the best of them, follow- 
ing too surely, though with a bias of our own, the Anglo- 
Saxon prejudice traditional to the race. And if the 
curious frame of mind that many reserve for fiction be 
analyzed and blame distributed, there will be a multitude 
of readers, learned and unlearned, proud of their share. 
Nevertheless, the righteous wrath inspired by the situation 
shal] not draw us into that dangerous and humorless thing, 
a general indictment. There are readers aplenty who, to 
quote Painter once more, find their novels “pleasant to 
avoyde the griefe of a Winters night and length of Som- 
mers day,” and are duly appreciative of that service. With 
such honest, if unexacting, readers I have no quarrel; nor 
with many more critical who respect, while they criticize, 
the art of fiction. But with the scholars who slight fiction, 
the critics who play with it, the general reader who likes it 
contemptuously, and the social enthusiast who neglects its 
better for its worser part, the issue is direct. All are the 
victims of hereditary opinion; but some should know better 
than to be thus beguiled.
-P-A-G-E-148
  142 CONDESCENSION TOWARD FICTION 
The Brahman among American readers of fiction is of 
course the college professor of English. His attitude (I 
speak of the type; there are individual variations of note) 
toward the novel is curious and interesting. It is ex- 
hibited perhaps in the title by which such courses in the 
novel as the college permits are usually listed. “‘ Prose 
fiction” seems to be the favorite description, a label de- 
signed to recall the existence of an undeniably respectable 
fiction in verse that may justify a study of the baser prose. 
By such means is so dubious a term as novel or short story 
kept out of the college catalogue! 
Yet even more curious is the academic attitude toward 
the novel itself. Whether the normal professor reads many 
or few is not the question, nor even how much he enjoys or 
dislikes them. It is what he permits himself to say that is 
significant. Behind every assent to excellence one feels a 
reservation: yes, it is good enough for a novel! Behind 
every criticism of untruth, of bad workmanship, of medioc- 
rity (alas! so often deserved in America!) is a sneering im- 
plication: but, after all, it is only a novel. Not thus does 
he treat the stodgy play in stodgier verse, the merits of 
which, after all, may amount to this, that in appearance it 
is literary; not thus the critical essay or investigation that 
too often is like the parasite whose sustaining life comes 
from the greater life on which it feeds. In the eyes of such 
a critic the author of an indifferent essay upon Poe has 
more distinguished himself than if he had written a better 
than indifferent short story. Fiction, he feels, is the play- 
thing of the populace. The novel is ““among the lower 
productions of our literature.” It is plebeian, it is suc- 
cessful, it is multitudinous; the Greeks in their best period 
did not practice it (but here he may be wrong); any one can 
read it; let us keep it down, brethren, while we may. 
Many not professors so phrase their inmost thoughts of 
fiction and the novel.
-P-A-G-E-149
HENRY S. CANBY 143 
And in all this the college professor is profoundly justified 
by tradition, if not always by common sense. To him be- 
longs that custody of the classical in literature which his 
profession inherited from the monasteries, and more re- 
motely from the rhetoricians of Rome. And there is small 
place for fiction, and none at all for the novel and the short 
story as we know them, in what has been preserved of clas- 
sic literature. The early Renaissance, with its Sidney for 
spokesman, attacked the rising Elizabethan drama be- 
‘cause it was unclassical. The later Renaissance, by the 
pen of Addison (who would have made an admirable col- 
lege professor), sneered at pure fiction, directly and by im- 
plication, because it was unclassical. To-day we have lost 
our veneration for Latin and Greek as languages, we no 
longer deprecate an English work because it happens to be 
in English; nevertheless the tradition still grips us, espe- 
cially if we happen to be Brahmanic. Our college profes- 
sors, and many less excusable, still doubt the artistic 
validity of work in a form never dignified by the practice of 
the ancients, never hallowed, like much of English litera- 
ture besides, by a long line of native productions adapting 
classic forms to new ages and a new speech. The epic, 
the lyric, the pastoral, the comedy, the tragedy, the elegy, 
the satire, the myth, even the fable, have been classic, have 
usually been literature. But the novel has never been a 
preserve for the learned, although it came perilously near 
to that fate in the days of Shakespeare; has ever been 
written for cash or for popular success rather than for 
scholarly reputation; has never been studied for grammar, 
for style, for its “beauties”; has since its genesis spawned 
into millions that no man can classify, and produced a 
hundred thousand pages of mediocrity for one master- 
piece. All this (and in addition prejudices unexpressed 
and a residuum of hereditary bias) lies behind the failure of 
most professors of English to give the good modern novel
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 CONDESCENSION TOWARD FICTION 
its due. Their obstinacy is unfortunate; for, if they 
praised at all, they would not, like many hurried reviewers, 
praise the worst best. 
I will not say that more harm has been done to the cause 
of the novel in America by feeble reviewing than by any 
other circumstance, for that would not be true; bad reading 
has been more responsible for the light estimation in which 
our novel is held. Nevertheless it is certain that the ill 
effects of a doubtful literary reputation are more sadly dis- 
played in current criticism of the novel than elsewhere. 
An enormous effusion of writing about novels, especially 
in the daily papers, most of it casual and conventional, 
much of it with neither discrimination nor constraint, 
drowns the few manful voices raised to a pitch of honest 
concern. The criticism of fiction, taken by and large, is 
not so good as the criticism of our acted drama, not so good 
as our musical criticism, not so good as current reviewing 
of poetry and of published plays. 
Are reviewers bewildered by the coveys of novels that 
wing into editorial offices by every mail? Is the reviewing 
of novels left to the novice as a mere rhetorical exercise in 
which, a subject being afforded, he can practise the display 
of words? Or is it because a novel is only a novel, only so 
many, many novels, for which the same hurried criticism 
must do, whether they be bad or mediocre or best? The 
reviewing page of the standard newspaper fills me with un- 
utterable depression. There seem to be so many stories 
about which the same things can be said. There seems to 
be so much fiction that is “workmanlike,” that is “fas- 
cinating,” that “nobly grasps contemporary America,” 
that will “become a part of permanent literature,” that 
“ays bare the burning heart of the race.” Of course the 
need of the journalist to make everything “strong” is 
behind much of this mockery; but not all. Hereditary dis- 
respect for fiction has more to do with this flood of bad 
criticism than appears at first sight.
-P-A-G-E-151
    
HENRY S. CANBY 145 
Far more depressing, however, is the rarity of real criti- 
cism of the novel anywhere. As Henry James, one of the 
few great critics who have been willing to take the novel 
seriously, remarked in a now famous essay, the most nota- 
ble thing about the modern novel in English is its appear- 
ance of never having been criticized at all. A paragraph or 
so under “novels of the day” is all the novelist may expect 
until he is famous, and more in quantity, but not much 
more in quality, then. As for critical essays devoted to his 
work, discriminating studies that pick out the few good 
books from the many bad, how few they are (and how 
welcome, now that they are increasing in number), how 
deplorably few in comparison with the quantity of novels, 
in comparison with the quality of the best novels! 
And what of the general public, that last arbiter in a 
democracy, whose referendum, for a year at least, con- 
firms or renders null and void all critical legislation good 
or bad? The general public is apparently on the side of 
the novelist; to borrow a slang term expressive here, it 
is “crazy” about fiction. It reads so much fiction that 
hundreds of magazines and dozens of publishers live by 
nothing else. It reads so much fiction that public libraries 
have to bait their serious books with novels in order to get 
them read. It is so avid for fiction that the trades whose 
business it is to cultivate public favor, journalism and ad- 
vertising, use almost as much fiction as the novel itself. A 
news article or an interview or a Sunday write-up nowa- 
days has character, background, and a plot precisely like a 
short story. Its climax is carefully prepared for in the best 
manner of Edgar Allan Poe, and truth is rigorously sub- 
ordinated (I do not say eliminated) in the interest of a 
vivid impression. Advertising has become half narrative 
and half familiar dialogue. Household goods are sold by 
anecdotes, ready-made clothes figure in episodes illustrated 
by short-story artists, and novelettes, distributed free,
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 CONDESCENSION TOWARD FICTION 
conduct us through an interesting fiction to the grand 
climax, where all plot complexities are untangled by the in- 
stallation of an automatic water-heater. I am not criticiz- 
ing the tendency — it has made the pursuit of material 
comfort easier and more interesting — but what a light it 
throws upon our mania for reading stories! 
Alas! the novel needs protection from its friends. This 
vast appetite for fiction is highly uncritical. It will swallow 
anything that interests, regardless of the make-up of the 
dish. Only the inexperienced think that it is easy to write 
an interesting story; but it is evident that if a writer can be 
interesting he may lack every other virtue and yet suc- 
ceed. He can be a bad workman, he can be untrue, he can 
be sentimental, he can be salacious, and yet succeed. 
No one need excite himself over this circumstance. It 
is inevitable in a day when whole classes that never read 
before begin to read. The danger lies in the attitude of 
these new readers, and many old ones, toward their fiction. 
For they, too, condescend even when most hungry for sto- 
ries. They, too, share the inherited opinion that a novel 
is only a novel, after all, to be read, but not to be respected, 
to be squeezed for its juices, then dropped like a grape-skin 
and forgotten. Perhaps the Elizabethan mob felt much 
the same way about the plays they crowded to see; but their 
respect, the critics’ respect, Shakespeare’s respect, for the 
language of noble poesy, for noble words and deeds en- 
shrined in poetry, is not paralleled to-day by an apprecia- 
tion of the fine art of imaginative character representation 
as it appears in our novel and in all good fiction. 
Is it necessary to prove this public disrespect? The 
terms in which novels are described by their sponsors is 
proof enough in itself. Seemingly, everything that is 
reputable must be claimed for every novel — good work- 
manship, vitality, moral excellence, relative superiority, 
absolute greatness — in order to secure for it any deference
-P-A-G-E-153
HENRY S. CANBY 147 
whatsoever. Or, from another angle, how many readers 
buy novels, and buy them to keep? How many modern 
novels does one find well bound, and placed on the shelves 
devoted to “standard reading”? In these Olympian fields 
a mediocre biography, a volume of second-rate poems, a 
rehash of history, will find their way before the novels that 
in the last decade have equaled, if not outranked, the rest 
of our creative literature. 
If more proof were needed, the curious predilections of 
the serious-minded among our novel-readers would supply 
it. For not all Americans take the novel too lightly; some 
take it asheavily as death. To the school that tosses off and 
away the latest comer is opposed the school which, despis- 
ing all frivolous stories written for pleasure merely, speaks 
in tense, devoted breath of those narratives wherein fiction 
is weighted with facts, and pinned by a moral to the sober 
side of life. It is significant that the novels most highly 
respected in America are studies of social conditions, re- 
flexes of politics, or tales where the criticism of morals 
overshadows the narrative. Here the novel is an admirable 
agent. Its use as a purveyor of miscellaneous ideas upon 
things in general is no more objectionable than the cutting 
of young spruces to serve as Christmas-trees. For such a 
function they were not created, but they make a good end, 
nevertheless. The important inference is rather that 
American readers who do pretend to take the novel seri- 
ously are moved not so much by the fiction in their narra- 
tives as by the sociology, philosophy, or politics imagina- 
tively portrayed. They respect a story with such a con- 
tent because it comes as near as the novel can to not being 
fiction at all. And this, I imagine, is an unconscious throw- 
back to the old days when serious-minded readers chose 
Hannah More for the place of honor, because her stories 
taught the moralist how to live and die. 
‘Lhe historically minded will probably remark upon

~~. 
these general conclusions that a certain condescension to- 
ward some form of literature has ever been predictable of 
the general reader; the practically minded may add that no 
lasting harm to the mind of man and the pursuit of happi- 
ness seems to have come of it. The first I freely admit; 
the second I gravely doubt for the present and distrust for 
the future. Under conditions as we have them and will in- 
creasingly have them here in America, under democratic 
conditions, condescension toward fiction, the most demo- « 
_y cratic of literary arts, is certainly dangerous. It is danger- 
ous because it discourages good writings In this reading 
society that we have made for ourselves, here and in western 
Europe, where much inspiration, more knowledge, and a 
fair share of the joy of living come from the printed page, 
good writing is clearly more valuable than ever before in 
the history of the race. Ido not agree with the pessimists  ‘ 
who think that a derhocratic civilization is necessarily an 
enemy to fine writing for the public., Such critics under- 
rate the challenge which these millions of minds to be 
reached and souls to be touched must possess for the cour- 
ageous author; they forget that writers, like actors, are in- 
spired by a crowded house. But the thought and the labor 
and the pain that lie behind good writing are doubly 
difficult in an atmosphere of easy tolerance and good- 
natured condescension on the part of the readers of the 
completed work. 
The novel is the test case for democratic literature. We 
cannot afford to pay its practitioners with cash merely, for 
cash discriminates in quantity and little more. Saul and 
David were judged by the numbers of their thousands 
slain; but the test was a crude one for them and cruder still 
for fiction. We cannot afford to patronize these novelists 
as our ancestors did before us. Not prizes or endowments 
or coterie worship or, certainly, more advertising is what 
the American novelist requires, but a greater respect for

his craft. The Elizabethan playwright was frequently 
despised of the learned world, and, if a favorite with the 
vulgar, not always a respected one. Strange that learned: 
and vulgar alike should-repeat the fallacy in dispraising 
the preéminently popular art of our own times! To Sir 
Francis Bacon Hamlet was presumably only a play-actor’s 
play. If the great American story should arrive at last, 
would we not call it “only a novel” ? a

  THE NEW NOVEL! 
ROBERT HERRICK 
Wuar is the new novel to be? In retrospect from another 
generation this phenomenon may not seem, after all, 
so different from its forerunners as contemporary self- 
consciousness would like us to believe. Time has a level- 
ling way with all human accomplishments, even those done 
in the pure ether of art, and the surviving landmarks often 
seem to have little relation with the intervening valleys, 
however noisily these were once inhabited. The increasing 
preoccupation with the novel in our days and its volumin- 
ous and multifarious production may be due less to a re- 
newed or undiscovered vitality in the form itself than to a 
growing realization of its adaptability to the needs of a 
crowded and self-conscious civilization. For it is beyond 
dispute that the novel has taken its place with the cinema 
and the newspaper in the vast cultural and interpretative 
effort of our world. That it is discovering within its 
flexible form new possibilities for the exploitation of new 
fields promises little for its present or future performance. 
It is the easiest and simplest weapon of self-revelation for 
a democratic society (however difficult and toilsome the 
complete mastery of its art is) and in its deepest essence 
must remain always autobiographical, and hence uni- 
versally alluring. ...

teenth century was largely concerned with the defence and 
the attack of these two metaphysical unrealities, and it 
was not until the century mark was safely rounded that 
we began to realize that the prolonged battle about real- 
ism and romance, like all vehement conflicts, had been 
waged in a fog of misunderstanding for an impractical 
victory. Neither side of the controversy had an exclusive 
possession of the truth, for neither ideal existed except in 
the partisan imagination of the theorist, and the sturdier 
practitioners of the art dodged back and forth between the 
embattled camps — as they always have done and always 
will do. For realism and romance represent, verbally, 
nothing more than two persistent moods of humanity, un- 
der which it surveys itself and the universe intermittently, 
not mutally exclusive, and together not completely occu- 
pying the ample territory of the human spirit. Consistent 
realism can be found only in the work of inferior and un- 
imaginative artists, because they are more easily satisfied 
with surfaces, and a world of surfaces is the nearest ap- 
proach to the absolute in a subjective universe. Con- 
versely it may be said that consistent romance easily be- 
comes nonsense, and human beings striving on the whole 
for the use of their intelligence quickly surfeit with un- 
diluted romance. That is what happened exactly at the 
end of the last century when, in this country especially, a 
new and uneducated reading public avid for simple imag- 
inative excitement boosted the sales of flimsy romantic 
novels to unheard of figures, then overnight rejected its 
passion. 
With the snuffing out of this unsubstantial romance, the 
way was cleared for better things (not that the cream-puff 
“line” of romance has wholly disappeared or ever will lack 
favor in a world so largely composed of naive people, but 
the flavors have been changed, and the more earnest crafts- 
men no longer supply the market for this kind of goods).

  152 THE NEW NOVEL 
The younger and more serious minded writers having given 
over the concoction of saccharine toys for the popular taste, 
ignoring the tiresome debates of the critics, went out for 
fresh adventure, and here it was that for nearly a genera- 
tion England led the way. There began a period of inter- 
esting experimentation, which pushed the novel into un- 
tried fields and carried it for good and all beyond that 
futile controversy of realism and romance. Novelists 
forgot their old preoccupations, as to what could and could 
not be done in fiction, what the public would and would 
not “‘stand for.” They have found that the scope of the 
novel can be indefinitely stretched to include new matters 
and new methods, and that the reading public will take — 
that is some part of it will take — whatever gives promise 
of novelty or a fresh perception of the old. Even dullness! 
For the ancient truth that the dull and the commonplace 
belong properly to life and can even be endured in literature 
when intelligently presented has also been rediscovered. 
Under the exhilarating leadership of Mr. Wells the new 
English novel assumed much of the kaleidoscopic variety 
of the newspaper and tried to teach the reader to think, at 
least to consider many hitherto unfamiliar subjects. It 
also acquired, at many hands, a new frankness about 
human sexuality, or perhaps merely lost a puritan reticence 
expression on private matters which had been tempo- 
rarily imposed upon it by public manners. Finally it be- 
gan a search of the Freudean caves for fresh motives and 
new thrills. Incidentally it had acquired from the glib 
interpretation of those opulent years just before the war, 
many of the European tricks of craftsmanship that had 
heretofore been concealed from the Anglo-Saxon by the 
veii of a foreign language. In short the novelist’s art had 
become, like morals, thoroughly eclectic and individual, 
choosing its methods and its materials where it found any- 
thing to its purpose, often whimsically. With this sur-
-P-A-G-E-159

prising wealth of plunder both in matter and form, it re- 
mains to be said in all honesty that this period had no great 
master of the prose epic — no Tolstoy, no Zola, no Hardy, 
nor even a Meredith; and the master ironist of the period 
was a Frenchman and his effulgence was that of a splendid 
and lingering withdrawal. 
Thus, then, to the period set for all things by the war. 
Since the war the novel, at least the more vivid interest 
in its possibilities, has come to this side of the Atlantic. 
For although experimentation still goes on in England, 
more especially among the younger women novelists, the 
triumph of arresting accomplishment seems for the moment 
quite departed. And in this country, though there is any- 
thing but a pause, one feels the anticipatory bustle of the 
approaching accouchement rather than the happy certainty 
of an actual delivery. Only the hard pressed newspaper 
critic and that indefatigable enthusiast who composes the 
eulogies on “‘jackets” any longer believe in THE American 
novel. Nevertheless we await with more than usual 
eagerness those American novels which will fully justify 
the present wide interest in the art of fiction. America 
is undoubtedly waiting to be “done” — adequately, and a 
considerable number of excellent experiments attest the 
fact that the writers are either already here or will shortly 
appear, who will do the big field descriptively, analytically, 
and synthetically with all the up-to-date technique (in- 
cluding Freud) and with something better than “promise.” 
They will find, indeed, that much exploratory work has 
already been accomplished unobtrusively by their elders, 
though most may seem to demand redoing, as it should 
in every generation. And they will also find (which their 
elders did not) that the subject is in a serious mood, will- 
ing, nay anxious to be “done.” The American public 
is now ready and able to take an objectively cool and 
interested attitude towards the reactions which it creates

in the artist and his resultant picture. That will be im- 
mensely helpful to the worker, for in this delicate under- 
taking there must always be a close codperation between 
the artist and the sitter. America is ready — or nearly 
ready — for a reappraisement and a restatement of her- 
self. ... 
Although this seems to speak encouragingly for an inter- 
esting and valid accomplishment before the younger Amer- 
ican novelists, freed and equipped as I have tried to sug- 
gest in the foregoing paragraphs by the progress of the 
art through the last generation, yet it by no means prophe- 
sies confidently the coming at once of great novels or great 
novelists. For these depend, I take it, upon certain ele- 
ments which in our ordinary discussions we are only too 
apt to ignore. One is upon the spiritual depth of the soil 
to be worked. If Main Street is to date a fair report upon 
the intelligence and the emotional depth of these United 
States, by and large (which I believe it is), then even the 
greatest craftsman will have to wait for his full harvest. 
One does not make enduring brick from that straw! But 
in the tremulous gropings of our fast changing time he 
may not have to wait long. ... As for the great novelist 
himself, it is well to remember that craftsmanship, method 
and manner and material too, are but the superficies of a 
great art. The inner, and the incalculable factor is the 
quality of the individual spirit — the soul (if I may be 
permitted to lapse into the vocabulary of my ancestors). 
Even with the novel I think we should be more interested 
in that, more concerned with that, than we are with the 
matter of the tools employed. We shall never be content 
with simply having our work “done,” no matter how faith- 
fully, nor how dexterously the artists wield their tools. 
What we are waiting for is a new world to be revealed to 
us out of the disguise of the familiar and the worn through 
the spirit of some one who sees deeper and farther and more
-P-A-G-E-161
  ROBERT HERRICK 155 
understandingly than we do, into whose vision we can re- 
sign ourselves confidently, as the religious convert resigns 
himself upon the bosom of authority and there finds the 
desired relief and freedom. Frankly I do not see upon the 
horizon of my to-day any evidence of such a comprehend- 
ing creator, fit to reveal the new secrets of this tumultuous 
scene, and to impose his own authoritative, indubitable 
sense of its life. (Now that the great Anatole, alas, is 
gathering the last threads of his long and finely woven 
skein!) When that larger personality arrives it will make 
little difference what his method may be or his material or 
where he starts, whether in Gopher Prairie or New York, 
because he will steadily and surely respin the whole of our 
universe from whatever accidental fragments he may hap- 
pen upon, and will consistently people it out of the secret 
stores of his own life. 
For we must not forget that men and women, however 
much at times they may seem to ignore or even repudiate 
the fact, are more interested in the inner truth buried 
somewhere within their souls, than with all the outer ad- 
justments and mechanics of their lives — and the two are 
only incidentally related.

    THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN 
POETRY * 
LOUIS UNTERMEYER 
Wuatrver qualities contemporary American poetry may 
lack, even its most reactionary critics must concede that 
the work produced in “these states” in the last decade has 
been distinguished by three outstanding features. ‘These 
three dominating qualities are, if I may be allowed apt allit- 
eration’s artful aid, its vigor, its vividness, and its variety.” 
Like a special pleader, intent on proving his case, I men- 
tion its vigor first because it is the most obvious and least 
disputed point. The energy of the new poetry need 
scarcely be argued; an entire literature attests the strength 
of the recent growth. Apart from the hundreds of volumes 
of original poetry which appear with every publisher’s list, 
we have a library full of collections, commentaries, and con- 
troversies. If nothing were left except the anthologies, the 
next generation would have a rich and voluminous record 
of our time. All degrees of tendencies and taste are re- 
flected in these collections alone — Jessie B. Rittenhouse’s 
little introductory volumes, Mrs. Henderson’s and Miss 
Monroe’s more advanced The New Poetry, W. S. Braith- 
waite’s annual selections of magazine verse (ten imposing 
volumes), Marguerite Wilkinson’s New Voices, the per- 
haps too catholic Modern American Poetry (its editor’s 
name escapes me at the moment), besides a score of text- 
books on the same subject. American poetry has never

had so great a fecundity or so ready a response; nor has 
the enthusiastic reception been merely local. Volumes of 
translations have appeared in France, Sweden, and Ger- 
many; Kurt Wolff, the Munich publisher, is actually 
printing an anthology of the contemporary American poets 
in the original language. Even England, after several of 
these collections had achieved not only London publishers’ 
imprints but tributes in the formerly hostile press, has 
acknowledged that there is a distinct American as well as 
an English poetry, that we are producing a poetry that is 
no longer colonial, no longer following the latest fashions 
in European letters, but a poetry native to the color and 
complexities of American life. “Always the free range and 
diversity,” sang Whitman, the liberator and spiritual god- 
father of the period. And it is the spirit of Whitman which 
has freed our poets, not so much in the matter of form as in 
the depth and intensity of their utterance. It was Whit- 
man’s use of material which his contemporaries considered 
too unpoetic for poetry, his insistence on the wonder of all 
of life, not merely a romanticized segment of it, his glorifi- 
cation of “the divine average,” which acted as stimuli on 
those who followed him. In the midst of his most ele- 
mental poem, he wrote what might well be the credo of 
those who try to gfasp existence as a whole, those to whom 
the cosmic and the commonplace have a related grandeur. 
“T believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the 
stars, 
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the 
egg of the wren, 
And the tree-toad is a chef-d’ceuvre of the highest, 
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, 
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, 
And the cow, crunching with depressed head, surpasses any 
statute, : 
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of in- 
fidels!”
-P-A-G-E-164

158 THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN POETRY 
But it is not only through the awakened spirit of the 
“glory of the commonplace” that Whitman made possible 
the vigorous tone of to-day, but by the influence of his 
speech. It is neither his form nor his philosophy which 
has played the greatest réle in the development of native 
poetry, but the quality of his words. By taking his lan- 
guage as well as his themes direct from the world about 
him, Whitman delivered a great blow to the type of poetry 
which was written almost exclusively by scholars for schol- 
ars. He established a democratic poetry; democratic in 
the sense that to-day we have a large body of verse that \ . 
seems written of the people, for the people and even, judg; 
ing from the number of magazines devoted exclusively to 
its practice, by the people. And its popularity may be 
directly attributable to this very simplification of speech. 
The average reader, half curious, half suspicious of the new 
product, found, more or less to his surprise, that poetry, 
which he had regarded as a kind of difficult exercise in 
preciosity, was something he could understand and ac- 
tually enjoy. He was no longer frustrated by his ignorance 
of classical allusions to the minor amours of the major 
Greek divinities; poetry seemed no longer a tortuous, sight- 
seeing tour through mythological ruins. It was no longer 
necessary for him to follow its course with a special dic- 
tionary of rare and obsolete terms. Life became his glos- 
sary, not literature. 
But, granting that the American audience has increased, 
from what, it has been asked, has the poet himself been 
freed? He has been released, first of all, from a preoccupa- 
tion with the past, from an inability to express life except 
from certain prescribed and narrow angles. He has opened 
doors and windows, taken his readers out of musty libraries 
into keen sunlight and quickening winds, has “‘let down 
bars rather than put them up,” has planted his imagina- 
tion ‘“‘on a hill rather than in a corner.” It is probable 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
LOUIS UNTERMEYER 159 
that, in many instances, he has swung to extremes in ex- 
pressing this vigor. He may use the chambered nautilus 
chiefly for dissection; he may call the village blacksmith 
from under his spreading chestnut tree only in an effort to 
psychoanalyze him. Even so, we must allow the experi- 
menter his natural vagaries, and the poet is no less the child 
of his age because he exaggerates, as a poet, certain of its 
temporary phases. He burns, in the universal passion for 
revelation, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and un- 
fortunately too often, nothing but the truth. But even 
this is an inevitable reaction to the time when romantic 
falsification was the fashion. It is an age of ferment, and 
the poets, its most candid and sensitive mirrors, reflect the 
diversity of a period whose development may find still 
stranger forms... 
But vigor alone, critics may well object, is a sign of 
health, not a proof of art. And if once the health of the 
new American poetry is admitted, its changing colors, its 
esthetic power, in short, its vividness is even less difficult 
to establish] The poetry of Robert Frost is, possibly more 
than any poetry produced in our country, of the soil of 
America. In such rich volumes as North of Boston, Moun- 
tain Interval, and the just published New Hampshire, there 
is not one prettily imitated pastoral, not a line of clap- 
trap bucolics, not a hint of specious (and usually irrele- 
vant) moralizing which his predecessors like to tag on the 
ends of their idyllic poems. In Frost’s lines, the gaunt 
hills, the rocky pastures, the reticent inhabitants of isolated 
farms and half-forgotten cottages — the stretches of New 
England itself — live with a new intensity. No living 
poet is more true to his facts, and none invests his facts 
with more fancy. Who but Frost could put such a whim- 
sical tone of voice in his farewell to his orchard entitled, 
Good-Bye and Keep Cold; who but he could summon, with 
so few strokes, the frightened colt “with one forefoot on 
ee

160 THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN POETRY 
the wall, the other curled at his breast,” in The Runaway; 
the worn-out incompetent in The Death of the Hired Man 
(possibly the best genre portrait in American poetry); the 
country boy, “climbing black branches up a snow-white 
trunk toward heaven,” in Birches; the clash between the 
questioner of old orders (“Something there is that doesn’t 
love a wall”), and the literal-minded traditionalist (“Good 
fences make good neighbors”) in Mending Wall. For 
sheer brilliance of epigrammatic power I know few things 
sharper than the “grace-notes”’ in Frost’s latest volume, or 
the unforgettable condensation of two memorable defini- 
tions in three tight lines: 
“Home is the place where, when you have to go there, 
They have to take you in. 
I should have called it 
Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.” 
Or, for an even more brilliant fragment, observe this 
lyric which, without leaving the tone of casual conversa- 
tion, is packed with whimsy and ironic wisdom: 
“Some say the world will end in fire, 
Some say in ice. 
From what I’ve tasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate 
To know that for destruction ice 
Is also great, 
And would suffice.” 
Edwin Arlington Robinson, like Frost, expresses, in a 
somewhat more austere key, the same mingling of scenic 
loveliness and psychological liveliness. Reacting against 
the old fallacy that poetry must have a vocabulary of its 
own, Robinson brings before us, with a remarkable gift of 
epithet, a living gallery of portraits. It is interesting to 
note that as early as 1897 (in The Children of the Night)
-P-A-G-E-167
Er ee ee 
LOUIS UNTERMEYER 161 
Robinson anticipated the concise etchings which character- 
ize Masters’s Spoon River Anthology; in the earlier volume 
we have the same probing analysis that distinguishes Mas- 
ter’s famous work with (such, at least is my prejudiced con- 
clusion) far more artistry and restrained power. American 
literature is richer for a score of Robinson’s figures: for 
Richard Cory, who “glittered when he walked” and who 
gnawed his dark heart even while he fluttered pulses with 
his apparent good fortune; the nameless mother in The 
Gift of God, transmuting her mediocrity of a son into a 
demigod through her dream which foretells “the proper 
shining of a soul where nothing ordinary dwells”; the half- 
humorous, half-pathetic Miniver Cheevy, always sighing 
for what was not, a vagabond lost in a mechanistic world; 
the defeated lovers in John Gorham (one of the finest of 
Merlin, and a dozen others. But it is not only Robinson’s 
characters which are so vivid; his characterizations and 
particularly his cadences are splendid in their tawny colors. 
American and, for that matter, English verse can boast of 
few climaxes more intellectually revealing or verbally 
ticher than such a slowly diminished ending:   “She crowns him with her gratefulness, 
And says again that life is good; 
And should the gift of God be less 
In him than in her motherhood; 
His fame, though vague, will not be small, 
As upward through her dream he fares, 
Half clouded with a crimson fall 
Of roses thrown on marble stairs.” 
Carl Sandburg has enriched the literature of his day with 
quite a different method. Sandburg’s vividness is due, in 
a great measure, to the intensity of his emotion finding ex- 
pression through an intensifying of the language of every- 
day. Never has the American vulgate been used to such a 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
ee marae ial ute ieee 
162 THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN POETRY 
literary effect. It is charged against him that he has bru- 
talized poetry, and no defense of Sandburg’s power can be 
undertaken without an admission of his frequent (and care- 
fully planned) crudities; for Sandburg is brutal only when 
dealing with ugliness. He uses harsh colors and raw dis- 
sonances when his theme is a vulgar dance-hall, or a Billy 
Sunday, or a battlefield; it would never occur to him to 
try to paint the howling energy of a steel mill in delicate 
pastels. One thinks of Synge and his prophetic preface: 
“Tt may almost be said that before verse can be human 
again, it must learn to be brutal... it is the timber that 
wears most surely, and there is no timber that has not 
strong roots among the clay and worms.” In Sandburg’s 
volumes — from the earliest Chicago Poems to Smoke and 
Steel — the concentrated angers, the social criticisms are all 
the firmer because they are born of a strength which derives 
its inspiration from the earth. They are all made of tough 
timber; they have “strong roots in the clay and worms.” 
But Sandburg is not merely a sledge-hammer bard of 
violence, not merely the vociferous laureate of American 
industrialism, in whose lines is heard the clatter of thresh- 
ing machines, the roar of smoke-belching chimneys, and 
the loud pulse of mid-western manufacture. As Sandburg 
has sounded some of-the most fortissimo notes-in-modern 
poetry, he has also breathed some of its quietest phrases. 
He has evoked the sun-soaked hush of the prairie, the still- 
ness of the Colorado canyon, the silence of sand, a half 
moon in a night wind, the fluctuating nuances of twilight. 
His well-known Fog is a brilliant example of Sandburg’s 
sensitive perceptions of half-heard overtones. 
“The fog comes 
on little cat feet. 
It sits looking 
over harbor and city 
on silent haunches 
and, then, moves on.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    
LOUIS UNTERMEYER 163 
Vachel Lindsay exults in the wealth of sounds and ar- 
rests us, first of all, by the sheer opulence of his orchestral 
verse. In such extraordinarily active poems as The Congo, 
A Negro Sermon, and The Santa Fé Trail, Lindsay again 
ent on-the ear rather aiaae the eye. In his release of new 
rhythms, he establishes, in the very heart of naive humor, 
an ecstasy that is basically as reverent as the simplicity of 
the negro spirituals. For Lindsay is not only a minstrel 
but .a missionary. Never before has any American 
attempted so infectious a combination as Lindsay has 
achieved in his wild blend-of rhyme, religion, and ragtime. 
The howling speed, the eruptive clatter, the released vital- 
ity of a hundred electric-light signs intensify his lines; his 
words rush with the sudden fervor of a full-page adver- 
tisement, dance with a grotesque athleticism, or snap, 
crackle, and leap with the loud rhythms of a motor-driven 
civilization. 
Essentially a people’s poet, Lindsay, preaching a gospel 
of communal art, often loses himself in a rhetorical evan- 
gelism; moreover, he frequently cheapens his gift by laps- 
ing into the vaudeville of verse. But, in the best of his 
poems, he is creating something closely related to the spon- 
taneous ballad, the unliterary folk-song with its appeal- 
ing directness. And it is this bright directness, this 
happy exuberance, which illuminates Lindsay’s leaping 
stanzas. 
Something of the same religious spirit animates the 
poetry of James Oppenheim. In Oppenheim one hears the 
voice of those ancient Hebrew singers who were preachers 
as well as poets. Songs for the New Age might well be the 
work of a minor prophet, a psalmist resurrected from the 
Bible; one who has worshiped Isaiah and Whitman with 
equal devotion. Individual poems like Tasting the Earth 
and the challenging call to free spirits in The Slave carry
-P-A-G-E-170
  164 THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN POETRY 
the note that lifts through all of Oppenheim’s work: “We 
are flesh on the way to Godhood.” 
Amy Lowell’s-vividness is.ofan almost opposed sort. As 
théleading exponent of those who interpret life from the 
esthetic angle rather than from the realistic or rhapsodic 
point of departure, Miss Lowell has given our poetry new 
colors and her fellow-craftsmen countless stimuli. Her 
many volumes (and Pictures of the Floating World is a bril- 
liant example) reveal not only a shining versatility but an 
extraordinary capture of visual perceptions. Closely re- 
lated to modern plainting, Miss Lowell’s verbal experi- 
ments have established her preéminently as the poet of 
the external world. Her lines, whether in regular or free 
forms, are studded with astonishing effects of light and 
motion; in her world, every blade of grass is boldly enam- 
eled and the very air, even when it is most dynamic, seems 
poised and polished. ! 
A separate study of the keen quality of the recent wo- 
men poets would be rich in reward. The lyricists alone, 
distinguished by a sharp mixture of candor and loveliness, 
would illustrate the great divergence between the sentimen- 
tal lace-valentine love-poem of the preceding generations 
of American amorists and the present school. _Sara Teas- 
dale and Edna St.-Vincent-Millay are the two outstanding 
leaders of a small regiment of writers whose lyrics, even in 
their most emotional moments, are never without intellec- 
tual support.. With the utmost simplicity of style and 
speech, both achieve passages (and not merely a few of 
them) which are little short of magic. Sara Teasdale’s 
Flame and Shadow and Edna Millay’s Renascence are two 
volumes that are destined for a much longer life than 
ninety-nine per cent of the books published in their time. 
“H. D.” (Hilda Doolittle), the finest of the “‘Imagists,” 
is another who has caught the very gesture of the moment: 
in her fixation of mass and movement, she achieves an  
-P-A-G-E-171
LOUIS UNTERMEYER : 165 
arresting exactness. She gives the very pressure an 
warm solidity of a midsummer day when she speaks of — 
“heat 
that presses up and blunts 
the points of pears, 
and rounds the grapes.” * 
Another closely related, if somewhat more introspective, 
woman-poet is Jean Starr Untermeyer. But, differing 
from her other contemporaries, Mrs. Untermeyer draws 
her strength from the material of domesticity. It is es- 
sentially the problems of a woman’s world that impel the 
weltschmerz of Lake Song, the mingled rebellion and resig- 
nation of Sinfonia Domestica (significant title), and the 
much-quoted Autumn, which is almost too realistically 
founded on the bright details of the domestic scene and is, 
in effect, a celebration of housekeeping. The very first 
line of this poem illustrates the latter-day sharpening of 
poetic speech and the intensification of figure. A tradi- 
tional poet, wishing to awake his early memories would ° 
have written, did, in fact, write — 
“How dear,to my heart are the scenes of my childhdd 
When fond recollection presents them to view.” 
Mrs. Untermeyer, making the active verb still more ac- 
tive, puts it thus: : 
“How memory cuts away the years.” 
Hilda Conkling, just thirteen, has the same freshness of 
vision as her older sisters. She sees and hears with the 
concentration of a precocious child, and she communicates 
the results of her observations with the sensory finesse of 
an unerring artist. This amazing child has the faculty of 
painting the familiar in unsuspected colors. She notes, 
with precise delicacy, that lilies of the valley are “clusters 
of bell-shaped moments, doves of time, little white 
doves,” that a shell-pink peony is “Queen Elizabeth in a  
-P-A-G-E-172
- 166 THE SPIRIT OF MODERN AMERICAN POETRY 
ruff,” that a bough of locust blossoms “smells like honey- 
suckle and poppies twined together,” that pigeons wading 
have “feet the color of new June strawberries,” that 
“morning is a picture again with snow-puffed branches” 
where the sky is “caught like a blue feather in the butter- 
nut tree,” that a blue jay’s feet in winter are “‘snow-dusty,” 
that “boulders have their minds on the center of the earth,” 
and that a Chinese city has a name “like music of gongs 
struck softly after dark.” 
The foregoing citations have, I believe, already estab- 
lished the third of my three contentions — the variety of 
American poetry. I have purposely refrained from dis- 
cussing the matter of new versus old forms as this is a 
topic which has worn itself out in futile controversies. 
There are, however, just two facts that may still be as- 
serted. One, that it is the matter not the manner which is 
most important in poetry; two, that while it is true that 
most free verse is vapid and tiresome, so are most sonnets. 
In passing, it may be significant to note that there is a 
decided reaction at present, a return to the formal 
measures; even the most ardent disciples of vers libre — 
révoltés like Alfred Kreymborg, Maxwell Bodenheim, and 
H. D. — are finding the craftsman’s delight in working in 
and triumphing over the restrictions of a definite mold. 
But the wide difference of pattern, subject-matter, and 
emphasis is in itself the greatest evidence of the spontane- 
ous diversity of this period. Never before has there been 
so widespread and many-voiced achorus. Instead of being 
confined to one locality (and one recalls the not-too-distant 
past when ninety per cent of the poetry of the United 
States was produced within a radius of fifty miles from Bos- 
ton) the sweep and spaciousness of the entire country is be- 
ing expressed by poets as far apart (in purpose and geogra- 
phy) as George Sterling in the Far West (California), and 
John Crowe Rafisom in the hitherto silent South (Ten- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  LOUIS UNTERMEYER 167 
nessee), Masters in the Mid-West (Chicago), William Ellery 
Leonard in the Northwest (Wisconsin), and Frost in the 
extreme East (Vermont). The range in tendencies is even 
greater. Every strong impulse — old and new, traditional 
and experimental — has its worthy exponents. What 
might be called a romantic naturalism is most prominently 
mirrored in the work of Frost, Robinson, Masters, and 
Sandburg, although recently, the last named (especially in 
his Slabs of the Sunburnt West) has been turning to a gno- 
mic mysticism. The art-for-art’s-sake persuasion finds, 
especially among the younger camp-followers, a strange 
medley of voices, the clearest of which are the dynamic 
Amy Lowell, the theory-logged Ezra Pound and Conrad 
Aiken, whose fluctuant lines waver with the nebulous 
music of the unconscious. The ballad is not forgotten; in 
the ringing chants of Lindsay and the vibrant narratives 
by the Benet brothers, the old rhythms take on new life. 
The wide gamut includes the delicate impressionism of 
Adelaide Crapsey and Wallace Stevens, the rolling rhap- 
sodies of Oppenheim and Giovannitti, the lyric affirma- 
tions of John Gould Fletcher’and John Hall Wheelock, as 
well as the ironic disillusion of T. S. Eliot, Maxwell Boden- 
heim, and a score of detached cerebralists. Nor is the 
latter-day product without its orthodox contributors; the 
traditional note (with the inflections of definite personal- 
ity) is firmly struck by Anna Hempstead Branch, Lizette 
Woodworth Reese, and John G. Neihardt. It is such con- 
trasts that cause so full-throated a singing as arises in 
America to-day and which explain its vitality. For the 
“new” poetry, sounding all strains, has achieved its place; 
in its democratic accents it becomes again the organ of the 
people, an instrument which registers not only the music 
of the moment but anticipates the harmonies of to-morrow.

lies at the back of endeavor. 
What, then, is lying at the back of any growth or devel- 
opment there may have been of late in drama? 
In my belief, simply an outcrop of sincerity — of fidelity 
to mood, to impression, to self. A man here and there has 
turned up who has imagined something true to what he has 
really seen and felt, and has projected it across the foot- 
lights in such a way as to make other people feel it. This 
is all that has happened lately on our stage. And if it be 
growth, it will not be growth in quantity, since there is 
nothing like sincerity for closing the doors of theaters. For, 
just consider what sincerity excludes: All care for balance 
at the author’s bank — even when there is no balance; all 
habit of consulting the expression on the public’s face; all 
confectioning of French plays; all the convenient practice 
of adding up your plots on the principle that two and two 
make five. These it excludes. It includes: Nothing be- 
cause it pays; nothing because it will make a sensation; 
no situations faked; no characters falsified; no fireworks; 
only something imagined and put down in a passion of 
sincerity. What plays, you may say, are left? Well, that 
was the development in our drama before this war began. 
The war arrested it, as it arrested every movement of the

day in civil life. But whether in war or peace, the prin- 
ciples which underlie art remain the same and are always 
worth consideration. 
Sincerity in the theater and commercial success are not 
necessarily, but they are generally, opposed. It is more or 
less a happy accident when they coincide. This grim truth 
cannot be blinked. Not till the heavens fall will the major- 
ity of the public demand sincerity. And all that they who 
care for sincerity can hope for is that the supply of sincere 
drama will gradually increase the demand for it — grad- 
ually lessen the majority which has no use for that dis- 
turbing quality. The burden of this struggle is on the 
shoulders of the dramatists. It is useless and unworthy 
for them to complain that the public will not stand sin- 
cerity, that they cannot get sincere plays acted, and so 
forth. If they have not the backbone to produce what they 
feel they ought to produce, without regard to what the 
public wants, then good-bye to progress of any kind. If 
they are of the crew who cannot see any good in a fight 
unless they know it is going to end in victory; if they ex- 
pect the millennium with every spring — they will advance 
nothing. Their job is to set their teeth, do their work in 
their own way, without thinking much about result, and 
not at all about reward, except from their own consciences. 
Those who want sincerity will always be the few, but they 
may well be more numerous than now; and to increase their 
number is worth a struggle. That struggle was the much- 
sneered-at, much-talked-of so-called ‘“‘new” movement in 
our British drama. 
Now it was the fashion to dub this new drama the “seri- 
ous” drama; the label was unfortunate, and not particu- 
larly true. If Rabelais or Robert Burns appeared again in 
mortal form and took to writing plays, they would be “‘new” 
dramatists with a vengeance — as new as ever Ibsen was, 
and assuredly they would be sincere. But could they well
-P-A-G-E-176
170 ANGLO-AMERICAN DRAMA AND ITS FUTURE 
be called “serious”? Can we call Synge, or Saint John 
Hankin, or Shaw, or Barrie serious? Hardly! Yet they 
are all of this new movement in their very different ways, 
because they are sincere. The word “serious,” in fact, 
has too narrow a significance and admits a deal of pompous 
stuff which is not sincere. While the word “sincere” cer- 
tainly does not characterize all that is popularly included 
under the term “‘new drama,” it as certainly does charac- 
terize (if taken in its true sense of fidelity to self) all that is 
really no form of expression which can pass the test of ring- 
ing true. Look, for example, at the work of those two 
whom we could so ill spare — Synge and Saint John Han- 
kin. They were as far apart as dramatists well could be, 
except that each had found a special medium — the one 
a kind of lyric satire, the other a neat, individual sort 
of comedy — which seemed exactly to express his spirit. 
Both forms were in a sense artificial, but both were quite 
sincere; for through them each of these two dramatists, 
so utterly dissimilar, shaped forth the essence of his brood- 
ings and visions of life, with all their flavor and individual 
limitations. And that is all one means by — all one asks 
of — sincerity. 
So much for the principles underlying the advance of 
the drama. But what about the chances of drama itself 
under the new conditions which will obtain when the war 
ends? 
For the moment our world is still convulsed, and art of 
every kind trails a lame foot before a public whose eyes are 
fixed on the vast and bloody stage of the war. When the 
last curtain falls, and rises again on the scenery of Peace, 
shall we have to revalueeverything? Surely not the funda- 
mental truths; these reflections on the spirit which underlie 
all true effort in dramatic art may stand much as they were 
framed, now five years ago. Fidelity to mood, to impres- 
sion, to self will remain what it was — the very kernel of
-P-A-G-E-177
  
ee 
JOHN GALSWORTHY 171 
good dramatic art; whether that fidelity will find a more or 
less favorable environment remains the interesting specu- 
lation. When we come to after-war conditions a sharp dis- 
tinction will have to be drawn between the chances of sin- 
cere drama in America and Britain. It is my strong im- 
pression that sincere dramatists in America are going to 
have an easier time than they had before the war, but that 
with us they are going to have a harder. My reasons are 
threefold. The first and chief reason is economic. How- 
ever much America may now have to spend, with her late 
arrival, vaster resources, and incomparably greater re- 
cuperative power, she will feel the economic strain but 
little in comparison with Britain. Britain, not at once, 
but certainly within five years of the war’s close, will find 
that she has very much less money to spend on pleasure. 
Now, under present conditions of education, when the 
average man has little to spend on pleasure, he spends it 
first in gratifying his coarser tastes. And the average 
Briton is going to spend his little in having his broad laughs 
and his crude thrills. By the time he has gratified that 
side of himself he will have no money left. Those artists 
in Britain who respect esthetic truths and practice sincer- 
ity will lose even the little support they ever had from the 
great public there; they will have to rely entirely on that 
small public which always wanted truth and beauty, and 
will want it even more passionately after the war. But 
that little public will be poorer also, and, I think, not more 
numerous than it was. The British public is going to be 
split more definitely into two camps — a very big and a 
very little camp. What this will mean to the drama of 
sincerity only those who have watched its struggle in the 
past will be able to understand. The trouble in Britain — 
and I daresay in every country — is that the percentage of 
people who take art of any kind seriously is ludicrously 
small. And our impoverishment willsurely make that per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  172 ANGLO-AMERICAN DRAMA AND ITS FUTURE 
centage smaller by cutting off the recruiting which was 
always going on from theranks of the great public. How 
long it will take Britain to recover even pre-war conditions 
I do not venture to suggest. But I am pretty certain that 
there is no chance for a drama of truth and beauty there 
for many years to come, unless we can get it endowed in 
such a substantial way as shall tide it over — say — the 
next two decades. What we require is a London theater 
undeviatingly devoted to the production of nothing but 
the real thing, which will go its own way, year in, year out, 
quite without regard to the great public; and we shall 
never get it unless we can find some benevolent, public- 
spirited person or persons who will place it in a position of 
absolute security. Ifwecould secure this endowment, that 
theater would become in a very few years the most fashion- 
able, if not the most popular, in London, and even the 
great public would gotoit. Nor need such a theater be ex- 
pensive — as theaters go — for it is to the mind and not to 
the eye that it must appeal. A sufficient audience is there 
ready; what is lacking is the point of focus, a single-hearted 
and coherent devotion to the best, and the means to pursue 
that ideal without extravagance but without halting. Alas! 
in England, though people will endow or back almost any- 
thing else, they will not endow or back an art theater. 
So much for the economic difficulty in Britain; what 
about America? The same cleavage obtains in public taste, 
of course, but numbers are so much larger, wealth will be 
so much greater, the spirit isso much more inquiring, the 
divisions so much less fast set, that I do not anticipate for 
America any block on the line. There will still be plenty 
of money to indulge every taste. 
Art, and especially, perhaps, dramatic art, which of all 
is most dependent on a favorable economic condition, will 
gravitate towards America, which may well become in the 
next ten years not only the mother, but the foster-mother, 
of the best Anglo-Saxon drama.
-P-A-G-E-179
JOHN GALSWORTHY 178 
My next reason for thinking that sincerity in art will 
have a better chance with Americans than in Britain in the 
coming years is psychological. They are so young a nation, 
we are so old; worldquakes to them are such an adventure, 
to us a nerve-racking, if not a health-shattering event. 
They will take this war in their stride, we have had to 
climb laboriously over it. They will be left buoyant; we, 
with the rest of Europe, are bound to lie for long years after 
in the trough of disillusionment. The national mood with 
them will be more than ever that of inquiry and exploit. 
With us, unless I make a mistake, after a spurt of he- 
donism — a going on the spree — there will be lassitude. 
Every European country has been overtired in this hideous 
struggle, and Nature, with her principle of balance, is 
bound to take redress. For Americans the war, nationally 
speaking, will have been but a bracing of the muscles and 
nerves, ¢, clearing of the skin and eyes. Such a mental and 
moral condition will promote in them a deeper philosophy 
and a more resolute facing of truth. 
And that brings me to my third reason. The American 
outlook will be permanently enlarged by this tremendous 
experience. Materially and spiritually she will have been 
forced to witness and partake of the life, thought, culture, 
and troubles of the old world. She will have, uncon- 
sciously, assimilated much, been diverted from the beer and 
skittles of her isolated development in a great new country. 
Americans will find themselves suddenly grown up. Not 
till a man is grown up does he see and feel things deeply 
enough to venture into the dark well of sincerity. 
America is an eager nation. She has always been in 
a hurry. If I had to point out the capital defect in the 
attractive temperament of the American people, I should 
say it was a passion for short cuts. That has been, in 
my indifferent judgment, the very natural, the inevitable 
weakness in America’s spiritual development. The mate- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    174 ANGLO-AMERICAN DRAMA AND ITS FUTURE 
rial possibilities, the opportunities for growth and change, 
the vast spaces, the climate, the continual influxions of 
new blood and new habits, the endless shifts of life and en- 
vironment, all these factors have been against that deep 
brooding over things, that close and long scrutiny into the 
deeper springs of life, out of which the sincerest and most 
lasting forms of art emerge; nearly all the conditions of 
American existence during the last fifty years have been 
against the settled life and atmosphere which influence 
men to the re-creation in art form of that which has sunk 
deep into their souls. Those who have seen the paintings 
of the Italian artist Segantini will understand what I mean. 
There have been many painters of mountains, but none 
whom I know of save he who has reproduced the very 
spirit of those great snowy spaces. He spent his life 
among them till they soaked into his nerves, into the very 
blood of him. All else he gave up, to see and feel them so 
that he might reproduce them in his art. Or let me take 
an instance from America. That enchanting work of art 
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, by the great Mark 
Twain. What reproduction of atmosphere and life; what 
scent of the river, and old-time country life, it gives off! 
How the author must have been soaked in it to have pro- 
duced those books! 
The whole tendency of our age has been away from hand- 
made goods, away from the sort of life which produced the 
great art of the past. That is too big a subject to treat 
of here. But certainly a sort of feverish impatience has 
possessed us all. America not least. It may be said that 
this will be increased by the war. I think the opposite. 
Hard spiritual experience and contact with the old world 
will deepen the American character and cool its fevers, and 
Americans will be more thorough, less impatient, will give 
themselves to art and to the sort of life which fosters art, 
more than they have ever yet given themselves. Great
-P-A-G-E-181

artists, like Whistler and Henry James, will no longer seek 
their quiet environments in Europe. I believe that this 
war will be for America the beginning of a great art age; I 
hope so with all my heart. For art will need a kind home 
and a new lease of life. 
A certain humble and yet patient and enduring belief in 
himself and his own vision is necessary to the artist. I 
think that Americans have only just begun to believe in 
themselves as artists, but that this belief is now destined to 
grow quickly. America has a tremendous atmosphere of 
her own, a wonderful life, a wonderful country, but so far 
she has been skating over its surface. The time has come 
when she will strike down, think less in terms of material 
success and machine-made perfections. The time has come 
when she will brood, and interpret more and more the 
underlying truths, and body forth an art which shall be a 
spiritual guide, shed light, and show the meaning of her 
multiple existence. It will reveal dark things, but also 
those quiet heights to which man’s spirit turns for rest and 
faith in this bewildering maze of a world. And to this art 
about to come — art inevitably moves slowly — into its 
own, to American drama, poetry, fiction, music, painting, 
sculpture — sincerity, and unswerving fidelity to self, 
alone will bring the dignity worthy of a great and free 
people.

AN ASSAY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY # 
CHARLES W. ELIOT 
Wuat are the essential principles and purposes of democ- 
racy? Is equality among men one of them? If so, de- 
mocracy is attempting the impossible; because every- 
where and always men are infinitely unlike and unequal. 
Is equality of opportunity for all men, women and children, 
a democratic object? Again an impossible goal; for the 
infinite variety of human faculties and gifts makes equality 
of opportunity unattainable. A chance or opportunity 
which one child or one adult can seize and profit by is no 
chance at all for another; because the second has no power 
to grasp or utilize it. No form of government — auto- 
cratic or democratic, by divine right or by popular evolu- 
tion — has ever provided equality of opportunity, or ever 
can. 
The prime object of democracy is and ought to be in 
creasing freedom, independence, comfort, and exemption 
from fear for all sorts and conditions of men, but this ob- 
ject cannot be attained until the poverty due to political 
institutions or social customs has been abolished/ Even 
then there will remain the formidable destitution or penury 
due to misfortune, vice, or the natural evils which afflict 
the human race, such as diseases, floods, droughts, storms 
and earthquakes. The abolition of poverty, therefore, 
requires two forms of codperative action by masses of 
people under wise leaders: First, the development of equal- 
ity before the law for all men, and the abolition of all privi- 
leges except those based on individual intelligence and

character, and, secondly, incessant warfare against the 
natural evils which mankind has always had to endure, 
and until lately has supposed to be insurmountable. 
The applied sciences, which have developed within the 
last hundred years effective means of resisting these natural 
evils, have been great contributors to the progress of 
democracy. This contest against the natural evils is in- 
vigorating for all the individuals or groups that take active 
part in it. No harm comes from it — only good. 
Our Morat Freepom 
Can the same be said for the freedom, independence and 
exemption from fear which democracy seeks to provide 
for men, women and children, which, indeed, American 
democracy has provided in large measure for the greater 
part of the population? Assuredly not. , Real freedom 
implies freedom to err, to sin, to act foolishiy or recklessly 
in regard to one’s self, and to injure others either thought- 
lessly or by design,) All these harms and wrongdoings 
which freedom for tue individual makes possible are every 
day occurring in American society, and they are going to 
occur in the future, because the freedom already obtained 
in American society will last. {So far as we know, the way 
of freedom has always been God’s way of building up char- 
acter in the individual man, the tribe, or the a Only 
in freedom to do wrong can the will to do right be strength- 
ened. ‘The only limitation which the family or the State 
can wisely put on this freedom is that children ancother in- 
experienced persons must sometimes be prevented by be- 
nevolent force from doing themselves serious harm. Little 
harms children had better learn to avoid through their 
own experimenting. 
Universal suffrage and the right of association for polit- 
ical, industrial, commercial or social objects have been 
sound, though subsidiary, objects of democracy for two

CHARLES W. ELIOT 181 
generations past in the United States; but it is obvious 
that large democratic progress was made for centuries be: 
fore universal suffrage was even dreamed of. How muck 
risk society is going to run because of the advance from 
limited suffrage to universal, including woman suffrage, 
does not yet appear. Is the instability of public opinion 
to be increased or diminished by universal suffrage? Is 
our democracy to become more radical or more conserva- 
tive, more liable or less liable to engage in rash adventures? 
This question is much involved with another. Will uni- 
versal suffrage select better leaders and representatives 
than limited suffrage has done, or worse ones? Prophecy 
on this subject would be rash; but any one is free to hope 
that universal suffrage in the United States will prove to 
be wiser than any limited suffrage of which this. country has 
had experience, and hoping is always wiser and happier 
than worrying. 
Menace or Lawiess Minorities 
In the freedom of a democratic State strong differences 
of opinion develop among individuals or groups as to what 
is just and right, or expedient and feasible, in private, class 
or public action; and these inevitable differences are apt to 
become hot and threatening. How has the American 
democracy dealt with them? By laying down the rule 
that the majority of votes shall determine action, and en- 
forcing that rule as soon as the majority is ascertained. 
Because democracy in this country has usually observed 
that rule, democracy has made more and safer progress 
here than anywhere else. 
Two flagrant violations of this invaluable principle have 
lately attracted some attention, but not enough: first, the 
filibustering performance in the United States Senate 
whereby two or three Senators, or even one, can prevent 
the adoption of legislation known to be acceptable to both 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
18g AN ASSAY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 
Senate and House, merely by talking against time; and 
secondly, the successful resistance to the execution of the 
Volstead Act by a minority of the total population. Both 
these violations of the majority rule are deplorable; but 
they are not hard to remedy, and are probably teaching a 
useful lesson on unsound democratic practices. Lynching 
and the operations of the Ku Klux Klan supply other ex- 
amples of minority lawlessness. 
Current arguments in favor of resistance to the Volstead 
Act include allusions to the austere manners and customs 
of the Pilgrims and the Puritans. These ancestors of the 
nine generations that have done the pioneering from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific, founding churches and schools as 
they advanced, had for a time strong objections to showy 
garments for women and children, to music in churches, 
and to dancing; but they were by no means “‘joy-killers” 
in the sense that they refrained from the use or abuse of 
beer, wine and distilled liquors. On the contrary, both the 
Pilgrims and the Puritans made free use of intoxicating 
liquors when they could get them; and their descendants 
have maintained the same practice all the way from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific. The Puritan men saw no harm in 
getting drunk at either weddings or funerals. When, under 
Massachusetts law, the Commencement of Harvard Col- 
lege was a legal holiday, the public gatherings on Cam- 
bridge Common and the gathering of Harvard graduates 
in the college yard were so drunken and riotous that the 
Sheriffs of Suffolk and Middlesex, each with a large posse, 
attended Commencement, and were always very actively 
employed. Whoever is familiar with the genealogies of 
the New England families that have come down from the 
seventeenth century knows that the commonest cause for 
the decline or extinction of those families has been the abuse 
of intoxicating liquors by their young men. To cite the 
Puritans as “joy-killers,” as do the advocates of the en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
    
CHARLES W. ELIOT 188 
forcement of the Volstead Act, is to fly in the face of the 
facts, 
America’s Epucationat SystEM 
Finally an essential principle of democracy is the right 
of every child to receive as much education as he can take 
in and hold during childhood and youth, and then the right 
of every adult to continuous education from his own obser- 
vation and experience in life until his faculties become im- 
paired or until he dies. , Many people think of education as 
if it were an affair of ch\dhood only, ceasing with maturity. 
Far from it. {The true education is that which implants 
and develops the love of accurate knowledge, truth and 
liberty, coupled with the sense of duty and responsibility, 
and also supplies and trains skill, personal power and en- 
joyment of work.) An education which fails to increase 
enjoyment, as well as to give power, is somehow wrong, 
whether in childhood or during maturity. A training 
which is not interesting and stimulating to child or adult 
is somehow wrong. 
The essential democratic right of every child and adult 
to a healthy and joyful education has very seldom been 
attainable heretofore in any school, college, university) 
trade or calling, whether in American society or any other. 
Only very exceptional human beings, now in one age or 
country and' now in another, have attained to it; and then 
or there only because of their own genius, and not through 
the action of governmental or social forces. Neither 
Athens at the climax of Greek letters and art, nor Rome 
during the short-lived republic, imagined any system of 
popular education; although Greece then produced in- 
dividual philosophers, historians, poets and artists that 
have never been surpassed, and Rome produced soldiers, 
statesmen and engineers of high constructive ability, and 
legal inventors and codifiers who were not equaled until 
the builders of the English common law appeared.
-P-A-G-E-190
  184 AN ASSAY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 
Both the Greek Church and the Roman Catholic Church 
developed and fostered the fine arts — architecture, sculp- 
ture, painting and music — but only for ecclesiastical and 
religious influences and enjoyments, and not with any edu- 
cational purpose, unless for the exceptional individuals who 
were capable of becoming masters in those arts. Not till 
the Protestant Reformation came did priests and rulers, 
like Luther, Calvin and Henry VIII, urge that the common 
people should learn to read, that they might be able to read 
the Scriptures translated into the native tongue. 
The Pilgrims and Puritans who planted families and | 
colonies on the New England coast felt strongly this mo- 
tive for the maintenance of schools, and through them 
faith in popular education has spread across the continent. 
But what a defective education, and how disappointing its 
results! The larger the country, the more heterogeneous 
the population as respects race, religion and historical ex- 
perience; and the greater the power exercised directly by 
ignorant and inexperienced voters, the greater the dangers 
to which the American democracy will find itself exposed.   
Tue Neep or EpucationaL Rerorm 
The World War and the state of the country during the 
last five years have exposed the condition of large sections 
of the American people as regards illiteracy, ill-health; 
bodily and mental defects and delinquency. Gu thinking 
people see that the free schools of the country-havé not 
“been-so conducted as to make American democracy safe. 
_~ The children and youth have not been adequately trained; 
; either physically or morally; they have been left ignorant 
 & subjects essential to the proper discharge of their duties

adult, who were ill-served by the schools of their childhood 
have learned little or nothing since. 
Sensible people, however, seeing defects, set themselves 
to remedying them. All thinking people who believe that 
democracy is the best form’ of government the world has \ 
ever seen because it leaves every citizen free to do his best 7 
for the public welfare should use all their influence so to 
change the free schools’ programs that every pupil should 
receive a thorough physical training, a sound ethical 
training, both explicit and implicit, and instruction in 
drawing, modeling and music, in cooking, diet and hygiene, 
in the elements of family and community economics and in 
the value of codperative management and discipline in in- 
dustries and society. 
Erurcat Trarnine Imperative 
Doubtless the most important of all these improvements 
in the public schools is the introduction of sound instruc- 
tion in the principles and aims of universal ethics. The 
present exclusion of training in ethics from all public 
schools is one of the most unfortunate results of the tolera- 
tion in religion which was embodied in the Constitution of 
the United States, and of the multiplicity of religions and 
Christian sects strongly represented in the American 
Commonwealth. A feasible mode of giving instruction 
in universal ethics in the free schools has yet to be invented. 
Several experiments on this subject are already being tried; 
but none of them seems promising, and particularly none 
of them is likely to take any effect on that large proportion 
of the American population which is.unchurched. The 
problem is to select a body of material for ethical instruc- 
tion which Roman Catholics, the various Protestant de- 
nominations and the Jews can agree upon for use in the 
schooJs, this material to include selections from the Scrip- 
tures, stories, fables, hymns and other poetry, drama and

music. Self-appointed committees in various parts of the 
«untry are already at work on this problem; and there is 
: better field for philanthropic and patriotic endeavor. 
t will take years to put all American children in pos- 
session of this kind of education; because a new breed of © 
teachers must first be raised by the hundred thousand, and 
also because the people have to learn that they should spend 
much more money than they have been accustomed to 
spend on the public schools. Teachers have to be trained 
who lead rather than drive, who know that the only 
healthy and promising child is the eager, restless, inquiring 
and busy child, and who encourage their pupils to incessant 
activity of body and mind, and to learning by “doing.” 
Schools conducted on these principles will cost much more 
than the schools which the American communities have 
heretofore been content with; because they will require 
more building space per pupil, more open ground about the 
schoolhouse, more tools, apparatus and supplies, and fewer 
pupils toateacher. One of the most grievous results of the 
inadequacy of American free schools is that the democracy V 
yearly spends billions on luxuries, some of them noxious, 
and yet refuses to spend thousands on prime necessities 
like education and public health. All patriots should urge 
more money for the public schools. 
Among the objects of modern democracy a wiser and 
more effective education should hold the second place, the 
first object being the increase of freedom and comfort for 
the entire population, and its deliverance from chronic 
fears.) A strong reason for urging a better education for the 
whole people is that applied science has lately facilitated 
combinations of ignorant or foolish citizens who quickly 
get together to promote their selfish interests, or to put 
into practice unsound theories. Universal suffrage and the 
initiative and referendum make this condition all the more 
dangerous.

account for some new practices of the rising generation at 
home and outside the home. The youth take over these 
new practices faster and more completely than their elders. 
and so appear to be abandoning some of the safeguards 
which seemed important to their parents or grandparents. 
Whether these new conditions are to lead to a moral decline 
or a moral revival, no social or religious philosopher can 
possibly predict. Meantime the American public, young 
and old, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, are just 
as ready to squander their money on magicians, astrolo- 
gers, quacks, suggesters, healers and false prophets as ever 
pagan or medieval public was — a complete demonstra- 
tion that American popular education has thus far been 
seriously defective. 
Evrore AnD AMERICA 
Such are the objects of democracy in America, and such 
are some of its anxieties. Has it any visions or hopes for 
democracy abroad? It still holds in its heart the belief 
that a prime object of the World War was to put down 
autocracy and make democracy safe the world over. It 
rejoices that the Russian Czardom, the German Empire, 
and the Austrian Empire look dead; and that the small 
States in Europe, old and new, feel themselves more secure 
than ever before against invasion by Governments dis- 
posed to conquest; and it is beginning to resent the low 
opinion which the present Administration at Washington 
has formed of the capacity of the American people for un- 
selfishness, self-sacrifice and the courage of its convictions. 
In Continental Europe, on the other hand, the rising 
democratic spirit lacks experience and competent leader- 
ship. The new Governments, whether in form republics 
or constitutional monarchies, lack stability, and can give

no real assurances to other Governments.) The manufac: 
turing and industrial classes have neither credit nor ade- 
quate raw material. Floods of paper money have washed 
away both private and public savings. Insufficient taxa- 
tion during the war and in the four years since the armis- 
tice has made heavier the burden of crushing national debts. 
Financial chaos prevails in Europe, and commercial deal- 
ings are reduced to some form of barter. Political con- 
fusion and alarm and the diseases which follow'on scanty 
food and clothing aggravate the general misery. After 
1848, on account of the long-standing racial, religious and 
social divisions within every European or Balkan nation, 
an elected Assembly was almost sure (except in Great 
Britain) to fall into several groups, no one of which con- 
tained a majority of the members. Hence a vigorous ex- 
ecutive, which had objects and wishes of its own, was well- 
nigh forced into intrigue and corruption very damaging to 
democratic progress in the American sense. To this day 
the American democracy does not understand these persis- 
tent European embarrassments. 
To these feeble constitutional Governments and suffering 
peoples the Government of the United States, the elected 
servant of the American democracy, has given no aid, 
either material or spiritual, since 1919. The American 
democracy itself looks on at this greatest tragedy of all 
time and does nothing to help, except in the drop-in-the- 
bucket way of private charity. 
Surely the times cry aloud to the American people to 
recover their morale of April, 1917, and again pledge “our 
lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor” to the cause of 
liberty, justice and peace among men.

THE MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM OF 
AMERICANS! 
GEORGE SANTAYANA 
Tur discovery of the new world exercised a sort of selection 
among the inhabitants of Europe. All the colonists, ex- 
cept the negroes, were voluntary exiles. The fortunate, 
the deeply rooted and the lazy remained at home; the 
wilder instincts or dissatisfaction of others tempted them 
beyond the horizon. The American is accordingly the 
most adventurous, or the descendant of the most adven- 
turous of Europeans. It is in his blood to be socially a 
radical, though perhaps not intellectually. What has 
existed in the past, especially in the remote past, seems to 
him not only not authoritative, but irrelevant, inferior, 
and outworn. He finds it rather a sorry waste of time to 
think about the past at all. But his enthusiasm for the 
future is profound; he can conceive of no more decisive way 
of recommending an opinion or a practice than to say that 
it is what everybody is coming to adopt. This expectation 
of what he approves or approval of what he expects makes 
up his optimism. It is the necessary faith of the pioneer. 
‘Such a temperament is of course not maintained in the 
nation merely by inheritance. Inheritance notoriously 
tends to restore the average of a race and plays incidentally 
many a trick of atavism. What maintains the tempera- 
ment and makes it national is social contagion or pressure 
— something immensely strong in democracies. The luck- 
less American who happens to be born a conservative, or

-P-A-G-E-196
    190 MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM 
who is drawn to poetic subtlety, pious retreats, or gay 
passions, nevertheless, has the categorical excellence of 
work, growth, enterprise, reform, and prosperity dinned 
into his ears; every door is open in this direction and shut 
in the other; so that he either folds up his heart and withers 
in a corner — in remote places you sometimes find such a 
solitary gaunt idealist — or else he flies to Oxford or Flor- 
ence or Montmartre to save his soul — or perhaps not to 
save it. 
The optimism of the pioneer is not limited to his view of 
himself and his own future; it starts from that; but feeling 
assured, safe, and cheery within, he looks with smiling and 
most kindly eyes on everything and everybody about him. 
Individualism, roughness, and self-trust are supposed to go 
with selfishness and a cold heart, but I suspect that is a 
prejudice. It is rather dependence, insecurity, and mutual 
jostling, that poison our placid gregarious brotherhood; 
and fanciful passionate demands upon people’s affections, 
when they are disappointed, as they soon must be, breed 
ill will and a final meanness. The milk of human kindness 
is less apt to turn sour if the vessel that holds it stands 
steady, cool, and separate, and is not too often uncorked. 
Tn his affections the American is seldom passionate, often 
deep, and always kindly. If it were given me to look into 
the depths of a man’s heart, and I did not find goodwill at 
the bottom, I should say without any hesitation: you are 
not an American. But as the American is an individualist 
his goodwill is not officious. His instinct is to think well 
of everybody, and to wish everybody well, but in a spirit 
of rough comradeship, expecting a man, every man to stand 
on his own legs and to be thankful in his turn. When he 
has given his neighbor a chance he thinks he has done 
enough for him; but he feels it is an absolute duty to do 
that. It will take some hammering to drive a coddling 
Socialism into America,
-P-A-G-E-197
  GEORGE SANTAYANA 191 
As self-trust may pass into self-sufficiency, so optimism, 
kindness, and goodwill may grow into a general habit of 
doting on everything. To the good American many sub- 
jects are sacred: sex is sacred; women are sacred, children 
are sacred, business is sacred, America is sacred, Masonic 
lodges and college clubs are sacred. This feeling grows out 
of the good opinion he wishes to have of these things, and he 
serves to maintain it. If he did not regard all these things 
as sacred he might come to doubt sometimes if they were 
wholly good. Of this kind too is the idealism of single 
ladies in reduced circumstances who can see the soul of 
beauty in ugly things and are perfectly happy because their 
old dog has such pathetic eyes, their minister is so eloquent, 
their garden with its three sunflowers is so pleasant, their 
dead friends were so devoted, and their distant relations 
are so rich. 
Consider now the great emptiness of America, not merely 
the primitive physical emptiness, surviving in some regions, 
and the continental spacing of the chief natural features, 
but also the moral emptiness of a settlement where men 
and even houses are easily moved about and no one, almost, 
lives where he was born or believes what he has been taught. 
Not that the American has jettisoned these impedimenta 
in anger; they have simply slipped from him as he moves. 
Great empty spaces bring a sort of freedom to both soul 
and body. You may pitch your tent where you will; or if 
ever you decide to build anything, it can be in a style of 
your own devising. You have room, fresh materials, few 
models, and no critics. You trust your own experience, 
not only because you must, but because you find you may 
do so safely and prosperously; the forces that determine 
fortune are not yet too complicated for one man to explore. 
Your detachable condition makes you lavish with money 
and cheerfully experimental; you lose little if you lose all, 
since you remain completely yourself. At the same time
-P-A-G-E-198
  192 MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM 
your absolute initiative gives you practice in coping with 
novel situations, and in being original; it teaches you shrewd 
management. Your life and mind will become dry and 
direct, with few decorative flourishes. In your works 
everything will be stark and pragmatic; you will not under- 
stand why anybody should make those little sacrifices to 
instinct or custom which we call grace. The fine arts will 
seem to you academic luxuries, fit to amuse the ladies, like 
Greek and Sanskrit; for while you will perfectly appre- 
ciate generosity in men’s purposes, you wil] not admit that 
the execution of these purposes can be anything but busi- 
ness. Unfortunately, the essence of the fine arts is that 
execution should be generous, too, and delightful in itself; 
therefore, the fine arts will suffer, not so much in their ex- 
press professional pursuit — for then they become prac- 
tical tasks and a kind of business —as in that diffused 
(form) charm which qualifies all human action when men 
are artists by nature. Elaboration, which is something to 
accomplish, will be preferred to simplicity, which is some- 
thing to rest in; manners will suffer somewhat; speech will 
suffer horribly. For the American the urgency of his 
novel attack upon matter, his zeal in gathering its fruits, 
precludes meanderings in primrose paths; means must be 
economical, and symbols must be mere symbols. If his 
wife wants luxuries, of course, she may have them, and if 
he has vices, that can be provided for him too; but they 
must all be set down under those headings in his books. 
At the same time the American is imaginative; for where 
life is intense, imagination is intense also. Were he not 
imaginative he would not live so much in the future. But 
his imagination is practical and the future it forecasts is 
immediate; it works with the clearest and least ambiguous 
terms known to his experience, in terms of number, meas- 
ure, contrivance, economy, and speed. He is an idealist 
working on matter. Understanding as he does the material
-P-A-G-E-199
GEORGE SANTAYANA 198 
potentialities of things, he is successful in invention, con- 
servative in reform, and quick in emergencies. All his 
life he jumps into the train after it has started and jumps 
out before it has stopped and he never once gets left behind 
or breaks aleg. There is an enthusiasm in his sympathetic 
handling of material forces which goes far to cancel the illib- 
eral character which it might otherwise assume. The good 
workman hardly distinguishes his artistic intention from 
the potency in himself and in things which are about to 
realize that intention. Accordingly his ideals fall into the 
form of premonition and prophecies; and his studious 
prophecies often come true. So do the happy workman- 
like ideals of the American. When a poor boy, perhaps he 
dreams of an education, or at least a degree; he dreams of 
growing rich, and he grows rich — only more slowly and 
modestly, perhaps, than he expected; he dreams of marry- 
ing his Rebecca, and even if he marries a Leah instead, he 
ultimately finds in Leah his Rebecca after all. He dreams 
of helping to carry on and to accelerate the movement of a | 
vast, seething, progressive society, and he actually does so. 
Ideals clinging so close to nature are almost sure of fulfill- 
ment. The American beams with a certain self-confidence 
and a sense of mastery; he feels that God and nature are 
working with him. 
In America there is a tacit optimistic assumption about 
existence, to the effect that the more existence the better. 
The soulless critic might urge that quantity is but a physi- 
cal category, implying no excellence, but at best an abun- 
dance of opportunities both for good and for evil. But the 
young soul, being curious and hungry, views existence “a 
priori” under the form of the good; its instinct to live im- 
plies a faith that most things it can become or see or do 
will be worth while. Respect for quantity is, accordingly, 
something more than the childish joy and wonder at big- 
ness; it is the fisherman’s joy in a big haul, the good uses 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM 
of which he can take for granted. Such optimism is amia- 
ble. Nature cannot afford that we should begin by being 
too calculating or wise, and she encourages us by the pleas- 
ure she attaches to our functions in advance of their 
fruits and often in excess of them; as the angler enjoys 
catching his fish more than eating it, and often waiting 
patiently for the fish to bite misses his own supper. The 
pioneer must devote himself to preparations; he must work 
for the future, and it is healthy and dutiful of him to love 
his work for its own sake. At the same time unless refer- 
ence to an ultimate purpose is at least virtual in all his ac- 
tivities, he runs the danger of becoming a living automaton, 
vain and ignominious in its mechanical constancy. Ideal- 
ism about work can hide an intense materialism about life. 
Man, if he is a rational being, cannot live by bread alone 
nor be a laborer merely; he must eat and work in view of an 
ideal harmony which overarches all his days, and which is 
realized in the way they hang together or in some ideal 
issue which they have incommon. Otherwise, though his 
technical philosophy may call itself idealism, he is a materi- 
alist in morals; he esteems things, and esteems himself, for 
mechanical uses and energies. Even sensualists, artists, 
and pleasure lovers are wiser than that, for though their 
idealism may be desultory or corrupt, they attain some- 
thing ideal, and prize things only for their living effects, 
moral though perhaps fugitive. Sensation, as I have al- 
ready suggested, when we do not take it as a signal for 
action, but arrest and pursue what it positively brings 
before us, reveals something ideal—a color, shape, or 
sound; and to dwell on these presences, with no thought of 
their material significance, is an esthetic or dreamful 
idealism. To pass from this idealism to the knowledge of 
matter is a great intellectual advance, and goes with do- 
minion over the world; for in the practical arts the mind is 
adjusted to a larger object, with more depth and potenti-
-P-A-G-E-201
  GEORGE SANTAYANA 195 
ality in it; which is what makes people feel that the mate- 
rial world is real, as they call it, and that the ideal world is 
not. Certainly the material world is real; for the philoso- 
phers who deny the existence of matter are like the critics 
who deny the existence of Homer; if there was never any 
Homer there must have been a lot of other poets no less 
Homeric than he; and if matter does not exist, a combina- 
tion of other things exists which is just as material. But 
the intense reality of the material world would not prevent 
it from being a dreary waste in our eyes, or even an abyss 
of horror, if it brought forth no spiritual fruits. In fact 
it does bring forth spiritual fruits, for otherwise we should 
not be here to find fault with it, and to set up our ideal 
over against it. Nature is material, but not materialistic; 
it issues in life, and breeds all sorts of warm passions and 
idle beauties. And just as sympathy with the mechanical 
travail and turmoil of nature, apart from its spiritual fruits, 
is moral materialism, so the continual perception and love 
of these fruits is moral idealism — happiness in the pre- 
sence of immaterial objects and harmonies, such as we en- 
visage in affection, speculation, religion, and all forms of 
the beautiful. 
The circumstances of his life hitherto have necessarily 
driven the American into moral materialism; for in his 
dealings with material things he can hardly stop to enjoy 
their sensible aspects, which are ideal, nor proceed at once 
to their ultimate uses, which are ideal too. He is practical 
as against the poet, and worldly as against the clear phi- 
losopher or saint. The most striking expression of this 
materialism is usually supposed to be his love of the al- 
mighty dollar; but that is a foreign and unintelligent view. 
The American talks about money, because it is the symbol 
and measure he has at hand for success, intelligence, and 
power; but as to money itself he makes, loses, spends, and 
gives it away with a very light heart. To my mind the
-P-A-G-E-202
  196 MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM 
most striking expression of his materialism is his singular 
preoccupation with quantity. If, for instance, you visit 
Niagara Falls, you may expect to hear how many cubic 
feet or metric tons of water are precipitated per second 
over the cataract; how many cities and towns (with the 
number of their inhabitants) derive light and motive power 
from it; and the annual value of the further industries that 
might very well be carried on by the same means, without 
visibly depleting the world’s greatest wonder or injuring 
the tourist trade. That is what I confidently expected to 
hear on arriving at the adjoining town of Buffalo but I was 
deceived. The first thing I heard instead was that there 
are more miles of asphalt pavement in Buffalo than in any 
other city in the world. : 
Nor is this insistence on quantity confined to men of 
business. The President of Harvard College, seeing me 
once by chance soon after the beginning of a term, in- 
quired how my classes were getting on; and when I replied 
that I thought they were getting on well, that my men 
seemed to be keen and intelligent, he stopped me as if I was 
about to waste his time: “I meant,” said he, “I meant 
what is the number of students in your classes.” 
Here I think we may perceive that this love of quantity 
often has a silent partner, which is diffidence as to quality. 
The democratic conscience recoils before anything that 
savors of privilege; and lest it should concede an unmerited 
privilege to any pursuit or person, it reduces all things as 
far as possible to the common denominator of quantity. 
Numbers cannot lie; but if it came to comparing the ideal 
beauties of philosophy with those of Anglo-Saxon, who 
shouid decide? All studies are good — why else have 
universities? — but those must be most encouraged which 
attract the greatest number of students. Hence the Presi- 
dent’s question. Democratic faith, in its diffidence about 
quality, throws the reins of education upon the pupil’s
-P-A-G-E-203
GEORGE SANTAYANA 197 
neck, as Don Quixote threw the reins on the neck of Ro- 
cinante, and bids his divine instinct choose its own way. 
The American has never yet had to face the trials of 
Job. Great crises, like the Civil War, he has known how to 
surmount victoriously; and when he has surmounted the 
present crisis victoriously also, it is possible that he may 
relapse, as he did in the other case, into an apparently 
complete absorption in material enterprise and prosperity. 
But if serious and irremediable tribulation ever overtook 
him, what would his attitude be? It is then that we should 
be able to discover whether materialism or idealism, lies at 
the base of his character. Meantime his working mind is 
not without its holiday. He spreads humor pretty thick 
and even over the surface of conversation, and humor is 
one form of moral emancipation. He loves landscape, he 
loves mankind, and he loves knowledge; and in music at 
least he finds an art which he unfeignedly enjoys. In 
music and landscape, in humor and kindness, he touches the 
ideal more truly, perhaps, than in his ponderous academic 
idealisms, and busy religions — for it is astonishing how 
much even religion in America (can it possibly be so in 
England?) is a matter of meetings, building funds, schools, 
charities, clubs, and picnics. To be poor in order to be 
simple, to produce less, in order that the product may be 
more choice and beautiful, and may leave us with un- 
necessary duties and useless possessions — that is an ideal 
not articulate in the American mind; yet here and there 
I seem to have heard a sigh after it, a groan at the perpet- 
ual incubus of business and shrill society. What does it 
profit a man to free the whole world if his soul is not free? 
Moral freedom is not an artificial condition, because the 
ideal is the mother-tongue of both the heart and the 
senses. All that is requisite is that we should pause in 
living to enjoy life, and should lift up our hearts to things 
that are pure good in themselves, so that once to have  
-P-A-G-E-204
  198 MATERIALISM AND IDEALISM 
found and loved them, whatever else may betide, may be a 
happiness which nothing can sully. This natural idealism 
does not imply that we are immaterial, but only that we are 
animate and truly alive. When the senses are sharp and 
joyous, as in the American, they are already half liber- 
ated; and when the heart is warm, like his, and eager to be 
just, its ideal destiny is hardly doubtful. Time and its own 
pulses will give it wings.

OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER, ITS 
STRENGTH AND ITS WEAKNESS? 
ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 
Tue three faults most commonly charged against our 
national character to-day are materialism, lawlessness and 
unwarranted self-assertion. These three sets of charges are 
made with about equal frequency. When we come to ex- 
amine the evidence by which they are supported we shall 
find that they stand upon very different bases. Those who 
accuse us of materialism charge us with a fault that is com- 
mon to the human race. They fail to prove that it is dis- 
tinctively American, or that we are worse than our neigh- 
bors in this respect. Those who accuse us of lawlessness 
can show that many of the things of which they complain 
are distinctively American, and that our record is not so 
good as we and our neighbors have a right todemand. I 
think we shall find that these facts point to defects in our 
machinery of government rather than in our national char- 
acter. But those who make the charge of unwarranted self- 
assertion seem to me to be able to prove their allegation, 
and to be rendering our nation a real service in calling 
timely attention to a distinctive fault in American char- 
acter which, if allowed to develop unchecked may prove as 
disastrous to us as a somewhat different manifestation of 
the same fault has already proved to Germany. 
Let us first take up the charge of materialism. This 
accusation means, if it means anything, that a nation is so 
occupied with the pursuit of physical possibilities of en-

joyment that its members are not attracted by intellectual 
pleasures or swayed by moral ideals. The writers of Conti- 
nental Europe have quite generally said that this was true 
of the United States; and the conduct of Americans who 
went to Europe, whether as tourists or as exiles, often lent 
a genuine surprise to Europe, and particularly to Germany, 
when the great body of the American people in 1917 dropped 
all thoughts of comfort when national honor was at stake 
and voluntarily accepted principles of universal service in 
matters of fighting and universal self-denial in matters of 
food. The history of the years 1917 and 1918 is in fact a 
refutation of the charge of materialism as it has been com- 
monly made. Nor was the experience of these two years 
an isolated one. Half a century earlier the American 
Nation had abandoned the pursuit of material wealth to 
engage in a war which was as purely idealistic in its under- 
lying motives as any in the history of the world — a war 
between the adherents of the liberty of the several States 
on the one hand, and the devotees of an ideal of national 
sovereignty on the other. Physically speaking, neither 
side had anything to gain by fighting which was at all 
proportionate to the risk of loss. The Civil War showed 
that the American Nation, South and North alike, cared 
more for its social ideals than it did for its physical com- 
forts.

Thad heard so much adverse comment on “the almighty 
dollar” during my childhood in New England, that I was 
much surprised and a little shocked, during my first visit 
to Europe, by finding that the mark and the franc, and 
even the shilling, seemed so much more powerful, in their 
respective domains, than the dollar ever thought of being 
in the United States. A mark given to a German railway 
guard, usually a uniformed public servant, would secure a

seat by the car window and as much privacy in your com- 
partment as was possible; while those who did not pay the 
money were crowded into less desirable places. Of course 
this sort of thing occasionally happened on our own side of 
the Atlantic. A customs officer at one of our Atlantic 
ports might be quite ready to relax the formalities of in- 
spection for a man who gave him a ten-dollar bill, or the 
reasonable certainty of getting one. But there was this 
difference: we saw the character of such transactions in its 
true light. Most of us did not bribe customs officers, and 
the majority of those who did were rather ashamed of 
themselves. We regarded the prevalence of the practice 
as a disgrace to the Treasury Department and ultimately 
got clear of it; whereas, Europe often seemed to have ac- 
cepted the principle of fees for preferential treatment as a 
matter of course. 
It is true that the pursuit of the dollar in American busi- 
ness is conducted with more spectacular intensity than it is 
in most parts of Europe. But the pursuit of the dollar does 
not necessarily mean devotion to material comfort. The 
dollar is a symbol. It gives its possessor the power to buy 
luxuries, or to increase his own invested capital, or to pro- 
mote his political and social ambitions, or to equip his chil- 
dren better for life, or to advance the cause of civilization. 
To pursue wealth for the sake of the luxuries which it will 
buy means materialism. But as we go up in the scale of 
uses the materialistic motive is gradually crowded out and 
intellectual and moral purposes become dominant. Now 
only a very small part of the wealth amassed by Ameri- 
cans is intended to be spent for luxuries. The fraction has 
undoubtedly grown larger since the war; but even to-day 
the increase of luxury is more noticeable among our unas- 
similated foreign elements of every class in society than 
among those who have come under the influence of our 
national ideals.
-P-A-G-E-208
  202 OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER 
As for the typical American who pursues the dollar, 1 
suspect that he is seeking it chiefly as a symbol of success 
in a great national game rather than for the sake of what he 
is going to get when he spends it. One thing that foreign- 
ers have always noticed in Americans is the enormous 
eagerness and seriousness with which they devote them- 
selves to the winning of any game. Probably it is the result 
of our origin as a nation of adventurers; whatever the cause, 
this sporting spirit is a dominant trait. Of our four great 
national games — business, politics, baseball and poker — 
the first is the most widely played and can become the 
most spectacular; and with our national temperament we 
get more excited over it than the French or the English do, 
and are in danger of forgetting that there are things in life 
more important than the winning of any game, however 
exciting. But this sort of thing is not materialism or any- 
thing like it; it is a crude and narrow but very intense kind 
of idealism. 
Iprats Wirnout CoiturE 
I think that the claim of Europe to superiority in these 
matters and the undue readiness with which America has 
been disposed to allow that claim have been due to the 
fact that on both sides of the Atlantic we have confused 
idealism with culture and treated the presence or absence 
of culture as evidence of the existence or non-existence of 
idealism. Europe is, undoubtedly, much more cultivated 
than the United States, and has learned to avoid many of 
our crudenesses of thought and action. She can show a 
hundred great monuments of art or letters where we can 
scarcely produce one. But culture does not necessarily 
mean idealism. It may or it may not. A very cultivated 
age may be chiefly occupied with getting enjoyment out of 
the physical side of life. The best age of Greek culture — 
that of Pericles — was idealistic; the best age of Roman 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 208 
culture — that of Augustus — was materialistic to the 
last degree. The culture represented by the Gothic 
cathedrals was accompanied by spiritual idealism; the 
culture represented by the golden age of Italian art was at- 
tended by materialism of the grossest kind. Much as I de- 
plore the scarcity in America of some things which make 
life in Europe best worth living, I believe that in the under- 
lying spirit of idealism our people are better off than those 
of Europe, and that our best chance of getting the culture 
which we lack lies in turning the idealism which we have 
into new and wider channels, rather than misconstruing 
or underrating it. 
The charge of lawlessness cannot be so easily set aside. 
For the supremacy of law is not maintained throughout the 
United States to the extent to which several other coun- 
tries have succeeded in maintaining it. We suffer from 
two somewhat different kinds of lawbreaking. The first is 
the resort to lynch law. Terrified by crimes against per- 
sons or property, or excited by appeals to prejudice, men 
refuse to wait for the slow processes of justice and decide 
to take the law into their own hands; in other words, to set 
aside the provisions of our Constitution which guarantee 
every man a fair trial and prohibit cruel or inhuman punish- 
ments. Whether the victim be guilty or not, and whether 
the penalty be such as the law would inflict or such as no 
enlightened jurist would tolerate, there can be no question 
of the lawlessness of the whole procedure. 
The second class of cases is of a very different character, 
but tends to the same disregard of law. In times of public 
excitement it is not hard for an organized minority to shape 
the course of legislation. It may be strong enough to 
control the councils of the dominant party as did the pro- 
slavery Democrats before the war, or the “radical” Re- 
publicans after it; or it may be so organized as to hold the 
balance of power between two parties and secure compli-
-P-A-G-E-210
    204 OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER 
* ance with its behests from the party leaders as the price of 
its support, as has been done by the extreme prohibition- 
ists in recent years. The fact that these minorities are so 
sincere in their belief in the rightness of their respective 
causes, makes them advocate radical measures; and as a 
result, we have had laws like the Fugitive Slave act, or the 
Reconstruction acts, or the Volstead act. 
In the course of a few years, a measure passed in this 
way must either get the public opinion of the country 
pretty solidly behind it, or become a dead letter. But the 
years that elapse before we know which of these things is 
going to happen are necessarily a period of lawlessness; 
partly because the strength of the police is being diverted 
from the support of public safety and public order in 
general, for the sake of punishing one class of statutory 
offenses, and partly because the countenance given by 
large sections of the public to the men who commit these 
offenses diminishes the respect for Government authority. 
Causes or LAWLESSNESS 
With these two sets of facts before us, it is impossible to 
deny that the American Commonwealth is in considerable 
measure open to the charge of lawlessness. But there are 
other facts in the case which indicate that this lawlessness 
is not so much chargeable to our national character as to 
our system of government; that it is not so much a fault of 
the people themselves as a defect in their constitutional 
and administrative machinery. 
When we sent our troops to Europe in 1918, their dis- 
cipline was a surprise both to our allies and to our enemies. 
And this discipline was not primarily due to the skill of 
those in command, but to the character of the men in the 
ranks and to their habits of self-government. Creditable 
as was the record of most of our company officers, the chief 
praise must go to the “buck private.” Now, habits of this
-P-A-G-E-211
ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 205 
kind are not acquired in a few months. The foundation « 
had been laid at home. The same spirit of order and readi- 
ness to conform to rules adopted in the public interest, 
which was manifested by the rank and file of our divisions 
in Europe, is seen in our public school children in almost 
every community where the educational system is at all 
well managed. The capacity of the American school for 
discipline and for self-government is as conspicuous as was 
the capacity of the American Army. 
But if the people as a whole are disposed to be orderly, 
where does the lawlessness come from? I think its two 
sources have been already indicated: too little provision 
for public security on the one hand, and too much ill- 
considered legislation on the other. Each of these things 
is a defect to which democratic governments are peculiarly 
liable. The fact that democracies love freedom makes 
them jealous of the police and unwilling to give them 
power enough; the fact that they elect the members of their 
legislative bodies, leads them to trust their Congresses or 
Parliament, and encourage them to legislate too much. 
But any self-governing people loves order and fairness 
quite as much as it loves freedom. If the police fail to keep 
order, the people themselves are tempted to punish the 
offenders; if the legislature makes laws which seem unfair, 
the people are tempted to evade or ignore them. 
So long as our Government remains what it is to-day, 
this sort of spirit is probably necessary, in order to prevent 
our social system from lapsing into anarchy at some points, 
or degenerating into tyranny at others. When the people, 
as a body, are of an orderly and law-abiding disposition, 
and the methods of government are defective, it is often 
more important to focus public opinion on these defects 
and correct them than to try to persuade the nation to 
accept laws which do not have public opinion behind them. 
We are told that the best way to get rid of a bad law is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  206 OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER 
enforce it; but this is not generally true. It is always an 
expensive way; it is usually an ineffective way. This 
maxim is often used as a means to perpetuate mistakes and 
wrongs, under the pretense that those who oppose them are 
in alliance with the lawless element in the community. It 
is difficult to discuss these principles dispassionately at the 
present day, because everybody thinks of their bearing on 
prohibition in its various aspects, but if we look back fifty 
years to the condition of the South after the Civil War and 
study the history of the Fifteenth Amendment instead of 
the Eighteenth, we shall recognize that there are times 
when nullification, rather than enforced obedience, may be 
the safer and more practical remedy for laws unwisely con- 
ceived or prematurely adopted. Great as are the evils of 
disobedience to law, there have been occasions in the his- 
tory of every great Commonwealth when what appeared on 
its face to be lawlessness was the manifestation, in more or 
less irregular fashion, of that spirit of self-government 
which is necessary to prevent legislation from degenerating 
into tyranny. 
Our Worst Natrionau Favuits 
The really distinctive faults which can be charged 
against the American people are not due to materialism or 
_ to lawlessness, but to the habit of unwarranted self-asser- 
tion. If we had to condense this charge into a single word 
we might use the term “bumptiousness.” But it is better 
to employ two words, because the evil is essentially two- 
sided. It results from a combination of two sets of faults; 
faults of superficial thinking or judgment on the one hand 
and faults of self-advertising and boastfulness on the other. 
In this respect we have fallen from the standard set by 
our fathers. The pioneer of the West was oftentimes nar- 
row in his thinking and unduly insistent on quick returns 
for his work, but he was hardly ever superficial. He was
-P-A-G-E-213
ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 207 
habitually self-reliant, but he was not generally self-asser- 
tive. The typical frontiersman was not the loud voiced 
braggart which he was sometimes pictured as being; on 
the contrary, he was as a rule self-contained and courteous. 
He had dealt too much with the forces of nature to over- 
estimate the value of mere talk. His eee was that of 
deeds and not of words. 
From what causes and by what steps did this self- 
reliance of our fathers degenerate into self-assertion among 
their children? The mere filling up of the country by a 
larger population had something to do with it. When 
households were scattered along the frontier each had to 
fight for itself and work for itself. When the country be- 
came more fully settled, each had to act with others, both 
in the fight for social order and in the work to provide the 
country with appliances of civilization. Politics and busi- 
ness both took a form where the leader was the man who 
could get control of other people’s votes or money rather 
than the man who could fight or work best for himself. 
And this gave the talker his opportunity. The fact that 
most of our American communities had grown up without 
libraries or theatres seems to have made them overvalue 
oratory. Listening to speeches was their chief intellectual 
diversion. The second generation of our Western boys 
lived in an atmosphere which led them to idolize leaders _ 
like Clay or Benton or Douglas or Lincoln; to measure a 
man’s power less by his acts than their fathers did, and 
more by his words. Ability to appeal to the emotions of 
those about him became the politician’s greatest asset. 
What happened in politics happened also in business, in 
a fashion which was less obvious to the public eye, but was 
even more far reaching in its effects on our national ideals 
and character. In the old days when men worked for their 
own communities, at prices generally fixed by custom, 
success depended upon industry and craftsmanship. As
-P-A-G-E-214
208 OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER 
they sought wider and wider markets the power to sell 
goods at a profit became the measure of success; salesman- 
ship took the place of craftsmanship, and the man who 
could advertise his wares best was more admired than the 
man who worked hardest to produce good ones. As our 
business men learned to borrow more capital, to control 
more laborers, or to depend more on public authorities for 
help, persuasiveness became an almost fatally important 
element in business success. 
The thing that made it almost fatal, was that it is so 
much easier to persuade masses of people by an appeal to 
their feelings than by getting them to think things out. 
It is much pleasanter to indulge our fancy under the influ- 
ence of a speaker who knows how to flatter us than it is to 
think things out for ourselves. Organized emotion tends 
to take the place of brains. 
Our schools ought to have put us on our guard against 
this danger. But, unfortunately, the school boards and 
school teachers themselves have in recent years been some- 
times more occupied with imparting the show of knowledge 
than with training the habit of thought. A few years ago I 
received a letter from a school Superintendent urging that 
our colleges should accept physics instead of algebra as a 
qualification for admission, because, as he said, it was so 
easy to get competent teachers of physics but so hard to 
find any one who understood algebra! When science is 
taught in this spirit the pupil is taught to overvalue the 
show which he gets so easily, and undervalue both the un- 
derlying substance and the expert who will go through 
the hard work necessary for mastering it. 
Under a combination of all these influences, we tend to 
overvalue the show of things. Instances of this are so 
numerous that I shall not try to give them; each reader can 
furnish them for himself. They can be found in every 
field, political, industrial or educational. Nor have I space
-P-A-G-E-215
  ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 209 
to set forth the dangers to which it exposes us, in our deal- 
ings with other nations or in the handling of our own 
industrial problems. I shall simply mention one or two 
suggestions as to the way in which we can best try to 
correct faults of character which have become so deep 
rooted. 
Mucu-Neepep CHANGES 
First, in the schools: Let us recognize that the know- 
ledge of the facts of history or science which the pupil 
gets is of very little importance as compared with the 
power of getting at additional facts for himself as he wants 
them and the habit of getting them right. And let us train 
him in these habits and powers by teaching him subjects 
where he will have to do most of the work himself instead 
of expecting his teacher to do it for him. He may not know 
so many things when he leaves school, but he will be a 
much more useful citizen. Instead of the “knowledge that 
puffeth up” he will have some of the “wisdom that edi- 
fieth.” And if, after the age of thirteen or fourteen, he re- 
fuses to do his share in educating himself, let us take him 
out of school and set him to work under proper regula- 
tions. Bad as it may be to set children at work too soon, 
it is still worse to leave them in a school where they are 
learning only to shirk and teaching others to do so. 
Let our schools at the same time extend as far as possible 
the good work they already do in teaching habits of cour- 
tesy. This will not of itself check superficiality or self- 
complacency; but it will go far to prevent it from becoming 
dangerous, particularly in international affairs. Bad man- 
ners have been quite as fruitful a source of international 
misunderstanding as bad conduct. 
Second, in business matters, public or private: Let us 
begin by stopping our artificial encouragement of adver- 
tising. I can show what I mean by one or two instances.
-P-A-G-E-216
210 OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER 
Congressmen have often been allowed to print and dis- 
tribute at public expense speeches which they never de- 
livered and perhaps did not write themselves, in order to 
show their constituents how actively they are promoting 
the interests of those who elected them. This is not only 
self-advertising, but fraudulent self-advertising. Or to 
take a case of another kind, not so bad in principle but 
worse in the amount of money involved: The income tax 
law has allowed a man to deduct, from the taxable income 
of his business, a percentage for advertising which was far 
in excess of what most men found necessary or desirable be- 
fore the law was passed. This exemption swelled the ad- 
vertising columns of our periodicals, created an artificial 
demand for paper which hastened the destruction of our 
forests, and lessened to a considerable degree the amount 
of income on which taxes could be levied — and all for 
what? ‘To increase the tendency to display beyond the 
point where business conditions would have pushed it un- 
aided. Men will not “show off” quite so much when we 
cease to give them artificial encouragement at public ex- 
pense. 
But this is only a beginning. In order to deal effectively 
with the evil of self-assertion, we must refuse to take the 
self-assertive man at his own valuation. When P. T. 
Barnum said that the American people liked to be hum- 
bugged, he laid bare one of our most dangerous weaknesses. 
It is so easy for us to accept a man’s own estimate of the 
value of his goods or policies and so hard to determine this 
value for ourselves that we are apt to abandon the habit of 
exercising our own independent judgment through sheer 
intellectual laziness. But this is just what the members of 
a free Commonwealth cannot afford to do. By listening 
to the man who can talk best, we fail to give a fair chance to 
the man who can think best or act best. The one way in 
which America as a nation can escape the dangers, at home
-P-A-G-E-217
ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 211 
and abroad, to which habits of superficial thinking and 
self-assertive talk have exposed us is for Americans, in- 
dividually, to refuse to let themselves be imposed upon by 
thinking and talk of that kind.

LIBERTY ! 
JAMES BRYCE 
We find four kinds of Liberty whose relations have to be 
determined: 
Civil Liberty, the exemption from control of the citizen 
in respect of his person and property. 
Religious Liberty, exemption from control in the ex- 
pression of religious opinions and the practices of worship. 
Political Liberty, the participation of the citizen in the 
government of the community. 
Individual Liberty, exemption from control in matters 
which do not so plainly affect the welfare of the whole 
community as to render control necessary. 
What are the relations to one another of these several 
kinds of Liberty? 
Civil Liberty may exist without Political Liberty, for a 
monarch or an oligarchy may find it well to recognize and 
respect it. But it was won by political struggles, and has 
in fact been seldom found where Political Liberty did not 
exist to guard it. 
Conversely, the presence of Political Liberty practically 
involves that of Civil Liberty, at least in the old historical 
sense of that term, because in a self-governing people the 
majority are pretty certain to desire for each one among 
them the old and familiar securities for person and property, 
which are, however, in some free governments less ample 
than in English-speaking countries. This applies also to 
Religious Liberty. Yet it is easy to imagine a State in 
which an overwhelming majority of one persuasion, relig-

-P-A-G-E-222
  216 LIBERTY 
ious or anti-religious, would accord scant justice, or in- 
dulgence, to those who dissented from the dominant view. 
As Individual Liberty consists in Exemption from Legal 
Control, so Political Liberty consists in participation in 
Legal Control. It is an Active Right. Between Individ- 
« ual Liberty and Political Liberty there is no necessary con- 
nection; each may exist without the other. An enlightened 
autocrat might think that discontent would be reduced if 
his subjects were given free scope for the indulgence of 
their tastes and fancies. But such rulers have been few. 
Monarchs have been surrounded by privileged aristocra- 
cies. An Absolute Government usually relies on its police, 
fears the free expression of opinion, is worked by a strong 
bureaucracy, naturally disposed to extend its action into 
the regulation of private life and the supersession of indi- 
vidual initiative. The individual has far better chances 
under constitutional government, for the spirit of democ- 
racy has generally fostered the sense of personal inde- 
pendence, and been a tolerant spirit, willing to let every- 
body seek his pleasure in his own way. Yet even popular 
government may care little for the “‘self-determination” or 
“self-realization” of the individual citizen. 
It is hard to draw any line of demarcation between Civil 
Liberty and Individual Liberty. The distinction is rather 
historical than theoretical. Both consist in Exemption 
from Control; i.e., in the non-interference of State author- 
ity with the unfettered exercise of the citizens’ will. But 
the conception of Civil Liberty was older than that of In- 
dividual LiLerty. When men were fighting against op- 
pression by kings or oligarchs, they assumed that there 
were certain restrictions to which every one must be sub- 
ject by law, while there were certain cther restrictions 
which must be abolished. It was against the latter, which 
nearly everybody felt to be oppressive, that they strove. 
Such were arbitrary arrests and general warrants and the
-P-A-G-E-223
  JAMES BRYCE 217 
power of the Executive over the Judiciary. What might 
be classed as being legitimate restrictions they did not stop 
to define, nor has any dcdy since succeeded in defining them, 
for the doctrines of thinkers as well as the nvtions of 
ordinary citizens have been different in different countries 
and have varied from time to time in the same country. 
Enough to say that although the conception of Individual 
Liberty may be made to include the exemptions our an- 
cestors contended for in the seventeenth century, and 
though every kind of individual liberty may be called a 
Civil Liberty, there is this significant difference that the 
Civil liberties of those older days were extorted from ar- 
bitrary monarchs, whereas what we call Individual Lib- 
erty to-day has to be defended, when and so far as it needs 
defence, against the constitutional action of a self-govern- 
ing community. 
I pass by the cases in which a democratic nation has 
shown by its treatment of a subject country that it does 
not value the principles of liberty for their own sake — 
such cases as that of the Athenian democracy ruling over 
the outlying cities whom it called its allies, or that of some 
of the Swiss Cantons, in their rule over their subjects in the 
valleys south of the Alps. Nor need we stop to consider 
cases in which a compact majority of one colour denies 
equal rights to those of another colour who dwell in their 
midst, for these have special features that would need ex- 
planations out of place here. But it is worth while to note 
the tendencies which in many free countries have, in ex- 
tending the scope of legislation and of the administrative 
interference of the State, encroached on the sphere in 
which individual] will and action used to move unrestrained. 
Our tines have seen a growing desire to improve the 
conditions of the poorer classes, providing better houses 
and other health-giving conditions, fixing the hours of 
labour, raising wages, enacting compulsory methods for
-P-A-G-E-224
  218 LIBERTY 
settling labour disputes. There is a wish to strike at the 
power of corporate wealth and monopolistic combinations 
by handing over large industries, or the means of transpor- 
tation, or such sources of national wealth as coal and iron, 
to the State to be managed by it for the common benefit. 
There is also a passion for moral reform conspicuous in the 
effort to forbid the use of intoxicants. In these and other 
similar directions the power of the State seems to open the 
most direct way to the attainment of the aims desired. 
But every enlargement of the sphere of State action nar- 
rows the sphere left to the will of the individual, restricting 
in one way or another his natural freedom. So long as the 
people were ruled by a small class, they distrusted their 
rulers, and would have regarded administrative interfer- 
ence in many of the matters enumerated as a reduction of 
their liberty. But this jealousy of the State vanished when 
the masses obtained full control of the government. The 
administration is now their own: their impatience desires 
quick returns. “Why,” they say, “should we fear govern- 
ment? Why not use jt for our benefit? Why await the 
slow action of aeticcatve forces when we can set the 
great machine to work at full speed?” 
These tendencies have during the last half-century 
gained the uppef | hand, and have discredited, without re- 
futing, the laissez-faire doctrine which had held the field 
of economic thought since the days of Adam Smith. They 
seem likely to keep the ground they have won. Regula- 
tive legislation may reduce the freedom of workmen and of 
employers, may take great departments of industry out of 
private hands, may impose new obligations and proscribe 
old forms of pleasure. A nation may, like the Prussian, 
submit to be forced into certain moulds in order to secure 
the military strength or industrial organization or commer- 
cial prosperity which a skilled administration and the use 
of public money can create. Minorities may fare hardly
-P-A-G-E-225
  JAMES BRYCE 219 
at the hands of majorities apt to believe that numbers 
mean wisdom, and persuaded that if they choose to impose 
a restriction on themselves they are entitled to impose it 
upon others. Nevertheless, where the evident good of 
society is involved, individual preferences will be forced to 
give way on the ground that to arrest the will of a majority 
is to sacrifice their liberty, and so neglect the happiness of 
the greater number for that of the smaller. But, whatever 
the future may bring, the freedom of thought, speech, and 
writing do not seem at present threatened. The liberty of 
the press is a traditional principle in the popular mind; 
democratic habits foster the sense of personal independence 
and express themselves in the phrase “Live and Let Live.” 
Two tendencies run through the history of the Church 
as well as of the State, both having roots deep in human 
nature. In daily life we note the presence of what may be 
called the centripetal and centrifugal forces in human so- 
ciety, the working of one set of tendencies which make 
some men desire a close and constant association with 
others, and of other tendencies which make other men de- 
sire to stand apart and follow their own bent. Some men 
are happy with Nature and books and their own medita- 
tions, others need the stimulus of constant intercourse with 
their fellows. In the Church the social impulse consolidated 
the early Christian communities under the bishop, and 
created monastic orders abjuring the free life of the world to 
dwell together, while introspection and the feeling of the 
direct relation of the soul to God produced the anchorites 
of the fifth and sixth centuries, and that strenuous asser- 
tion of the rights of individual conscience which came from 
the English Puritans of the seventeenth. Without the 
one tendency, action would be disconnected and ineffec- 
tive; without the other, thought would lose in variety and 
vigor; there would be less poetry and less philosophy. 
Ubi spiritus Domini, ibi Libertas. The world seems to  
-P-A-G-E-226
  220 LIBERTY 
have now entered an era in which the principles of asso- 
ciated action and of the dominance of the community are 
gaining strength. Though the Prussian doctrine of the 
State is unwelcome to English-speaking peoples, the poli- 
cies it has suggested have been slowly, almost insensibly, 
supplanting the individualism of last century. The ideal 
of happiness may change from that of birds wantoning in 
the air to that of bees busy in carrying honey to the com- 
mon hive. We perceive that the enthusiasm for liberty 
which fired men’s hearts for a century or more from the 
beginning of the American Revolution down to our own 
time has now grown cool. The dithyrambic expression it 
found in the poets and orators of those days sounds strange 
and hollow in the ears of the present generation, bent on 
securing, with the least possible exertion, the material 
conditions of comfort and well-being. 
Liberty may not have achieved all that was expected, 
yet it remains true that nothing is more vital to national 
progress than the spontaneous development of individual 
character, and that free play of intellect which is independ- 
ent of current prejudice, examines everything by the light 
of reason and history, and fearlessly defends unpopular 
opinions. Independence of thought was formerly threat- 
ened by monarchs who feared the disaffection of their 
subjects. May it not again be threatened by other forms 
of intolerance, possible even in a popular government? 
Room should be found in every country for men who, 
like the prophets in ancient Israel, have along with their 
wrath at the evils of their own time inspiring visions of a 
better future and the right to speak their minds. That 
love of freedom which will bear with opposition because it 
has faith in the victory of truth is none too common. Many 
of those who have the word on their lips are despots at 
heart. Those men in whom that love seemed to glow with 
the hottest flame may have had an almost excessive faith
-P-A-G-E-227
JAMES BRYCE , 221 
in its power for good, but if this be an infirmity, it is an in- 
firmity of noble minds, which democracies ought to honor. 
Not less than any other form of government does de- 
mocracy need to cherish Individual liberty. It is, like 
oxygen in the air, a life-giving spirit. Political liberty will 
have seen one of its fairest fruits wither on the bough if 
that spirit should decline.  
-P-A-G-E-228
  THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE 
CONSTITUTION #4 
JAMES M. BECK 
“Moribus antiquis stat res Romana virisque.” 
Wattx the Constitution apparently only deals with the 
practical and essential details of government, yet under- 
lying these simply but wonderfully phrased delegations of 
power is a broad and accurate political philosophy, which 
goes far to state the “law and the prophets” of free govern- 
ment. 
These essential principles of the Constitution may be 
briefly summarized as follows: 
I 
The first is representative government. 
Nothing is more striking in the debates of the Conven- 
tion than the distrust of its members, with few exceptions, 
of what they called “democracy.” By this term they 
meant the power of the people to legislate directly and 
without the intervention of chosen representatives. They 
believed that the utmost concession that could be safely 
made to democracy was the power to select suitable men to 
legislate for the common good, and nothing is more 
striking in the Constitution than the care with which they 
sought to remove the powers of legislation from the direct 
action of the people. Nowhere in the instrument is there 
a suggestion of the initiative or referendum. Even an 
amendment to the Constitution could not be directly pro- 
posed by the people in the exercise of their residual power 
1 From The Constitution of the United States, Yesterday, To-day, and. To- 
morrow. By permission of George H. Doran Company, publishers.
-P-A-G-E-229
JAMES M. BECK 223 
or adopted by them. As previously said, it could only be 
proposed by two-thirds of the House and the Senate, or by 
a convention called by Congress on application of the legis- 
latures of two-thirds of the States, and in either alterna- 
tive could become effective only if ratified by three-fourths 
of the States, acting, not by a popular vote, but through 
their chosen representatives either in their legislatures or 
special conventions. Thus they denied the power of a 
majority to alter even the form of government. More- 
over, they gave to the President the power to nullify laws 
passed by a majority of the House and Senate by his simple 
veto, and yet, fearful of an unqualified power of the Presi- 
dent in this respect, they provided that the veto itself 
should be vetoed, if two-thirds of the Senate and House con- 
curred in such action. Moreover, the great limitations of 
the Constitution, which forbid the majority, or even the 
whole body of the House and Senate, to pass laws either 
for want of authority or because they impair fundamental 
rights of individuals, are as emphatic a negation of an 
absolute democracy as can be found in any form of govern- 
ment. Measured by present-day conventions of demo- 
cracy, the Constitution is an undemocratic document. 
I 
The second and most novel principle of the Constitution is 
its dual form of government. 
This constituted a unique contribution to the science of 
politics. This was early recognized by de Tocqueville, one 
of the most acute students of the Constitution, who said 
that it was based “upon a wholly novel theory, which may 
be considered a great discovery in modern political science.” 
Previous to the Constitution it had not been thought 
possible to divide sovereignty, or at least to have two 
different sovereignties moving as planets in the same orbit. 
Therefore, all previous federated governments had been 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  224 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION 
based upon the plan that a league could only effect its will 
through the constituent States and that the citizens in 
these States owed no direct allegiance to the league, but 
only to the States of which they were members. The Con- 
stitution, however, developed the idea of a dual citizen- 
ship. While the people remained citizens of their respec- 
tive States in the sphere of government which was reserved 
to the States, yet they directly became citizens of the cen- 
tral government, and, as such, ceased to be citizens of the 
several States in the sphere of government delegated to the 
central power; and this allegiance was enforced by the 
direct action of the central government on the citizens as 
individuals. Thus has been developed one of the most 
intricately complex governmental systems in the world. 
Under the Constitution, governmental power is — like 
ancient Gaul (according to Cesar) — “divided into three 
parts.” The first is the power granted to the central 
Government. The second, that reserved to the States, 
and the third and most important of all — although the 
fact is not generally recognized — the power reserved to the 
people under the many inhibitions both of State and Fed- 
eral legislation. 
Sixty-five powers are given to the Federal Government 
and seventy-nine are withheld, of which thirteen are denied 
both to that Government and to the constituent States. 
Forty-three of the sixty-five powers given to the Federal 
Government are expressly denied to the States; while, as to 
eighteen powers, the grant is concurrent. 
However, the division of powers cannot be indicated 
merely by counting; for some of the powers granted to the 
Federal Government have, in an age of economic central- 
ization, become so vast that the shadow of Federal author- 
ity is always extending — not by the deliberate action of 
men, but by the imperative force of economic influences — 
and is fast eclipsing the power of the States.
-P-A-G-E-231
JAMES M. BECK 225 
At the time of the adoption of the Constitution this 
division of jurisdiction was quite feasible, for, geographi- 
cally, the various States were widely separated, and the 
lack of economic contact made it easy for each government 
to function without serious conflict. The framers, how- 
ever, did not sufficiently reckon with the mechanical 
changes in society that were then beginning. They did 
not anticipate, and could not have anticipated, the centrip- 
etal influences of steam and electricity which have woven 
the American people into an indissoluble unit for commer- 
cial and many other purposes. As a result many laws of 
the Federal Government, in their incidences in this com- 
plex age, directly impinge upon rights of the State govern- 
ments, and vice versa, and the practical application of the 
Constitution has required a very subtle adaptation of a 
form of government, enacted in a primitive age, to one of a 
complex age. 
Thus the Federal Government was given plenary power 
over foreign commerce and commerce among the States, 
but the power over commerce within a State, was reserved 
to State governments. This presupposed the power of 
government to divide commerce into two water-tight com- 
partments, or, at least, to regard the two spheres of power 
as parallel lines that would never meet; whereas, with the 
coming of the railroad, steamship and the telegraph, com- 
merce has become so unified that the parallel lines have 
become lines of interlacing zigzags. To adapt the com- 
merce clause of the Constitution to these changed condi- 
tions has required the constructive genius of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, and, in a series of very remark- 
able decisions, which are contained in 263 volumes of the 
official reports, that great tribunal has tried to draw a line 
between inter-State and domestic commerce as nearly to 
the original plans of the framers as it was possible; but 
obviously there has been so much adaptation to make this  
-P-A-G-E-232
  226 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION 
possible that if Washington, Franklin, Madison and Hamil- 
ton could revisit the nation they created they would not 
recognize their own handiwork. 
For the same reason, the dual system of government has 
been profoundly modified by the great elemental forces of 
our mechanical age, so that the scales, which try to hold in 
nice equipoise the Federal Government on the one hand 
and the States on the other, have been greatly disturbed. 
Originally, the States were the powerful political entities, 
and the central government a mere agent for certain 
specific purposes; but, in the development of the Consti- 
tution, the nation has naturally become of overshadowing 
importance, while the States have relatively steadily di- 
minished in power and prestige. 
These inevitable tendencies in American politics are 
called “centralization,” and while for nearly a century a 
great political party bitterly contested its steady progress, 
due to the centripetal influences above indicated, yet the 
contest was long since abandoned as a hopeless one, and 
the struggle to-day is rather to keep, so far as possible, the 
inevitable tendency measurably in check. 
Nevertheless, it would be erroneous to suggest that the 
dual system of government is a failure. It still endures in 
providing a large measure of authority to the States in their 
purely domestic concerns, and, in a country that extends 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the 
Gulf, whose northern border is not very far from the Arctic 
Circle, and whose southern border is not many degrees 
from the Equator, there are such differences in the habits, 
conventions, and ideals of the people that without this 
dual form of government the Constitution would long 
since have broken down. It is not too much to say that 
the success with which the framers of the Constitution 
reconciled national supremacy and efficiency with local 
self-government is one of the great achievements in the 
history of mankind.
-P-A-G-E-233
  JAMES M. BECK 227 
mm 
The third principle was the guaranty of individual liberty 
through constitutional limitations. 
This marked another great contribution of America to 
the science of government. In all previous government 
building, the State was regarded as a sovereign, which 
could grant to individuals or classes out of its plenary 
power certain privileges or exemptions, which were called 
“liberties.” Thus the liberties which the barons wrung 
from King John at Runnymede were virtually exemptions 
from the power of Government. The Fathers did not be- 
lieve in the sovereignty of the State in the sense of abso- 
lute power, nor did they believe in the sovereignty of the 
people in that sense. The word “sovereignty” will not be 
found in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independ- 
ence. They believed that each individual, as a respon- 
sible moral being, had certain “inalienable rights” which 
neither the State nor the people could rightfully take from 
him. 
This conception of individualism, enforced in courts of 
law against executives and legislatures, was wholly new and 
is the distinguishing characteristic of American constitu- 
tionalism. As to such reserved rights, guaranteed by Con- 
stitutional limitations, and largely by the first ten Amend- 
ments to the Constitution, a man, by virtue of his inherent 
and God-given dignity as a human soul, has rights, such as 
freedom of the Press, liberty of speech, property rights, and 
religious freedom, which even one hundred millions of 
people cannot rightfully take from him, without amending 
the Constitution. The Framers did not believe that the 
oil of anointing that was supposed to sanctify the monarch 
and give him infallibility had fallen upon the “multitu- 
dinous tongue” of the people to give it either infallibility 
or omnipotence. They believed in individualism. They
-P-A-G-E-234
  228 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION 
were animated by a sleepless jealousy of governmental 
power. They believed that the greater such power the 
greater the danger of its abuse. They felt that the individ- 
ual could generally best work out his own salvation and 
that his constant prayer to government was that of 
Diogenes to Alexander: ‘‘ Keep out of my sunlight.” The 
worth and dignity of the human soul, the free competition 
of man and man, the nobility of labor, the right to work, 
free from the tyranny of state or class, this was their gospel. 
Socialism was to them abhorrent. 
This theory of government gave a new dignity to man- 
hood. It said to the State: “‘ There is a limit to your power. 
Thus far and no farther, and here shall the proud waves 
be stayed.” 
IV 
Closely allied to this doctrine of limited governmental 
powers, even by a majority, is the fourth principle of an inde- 
pendent judiciary. 
It is the balance wheel of the Constitution, and to func- 
tion it must be beyond the possibility of attack and destruc- 
tion. This country was founded upon the rock of property 
rights and the sanctity of contracts, nor can Congress take 
away life, liberty, or property “without due process of 
law.” The guarantee is as old as Magna Charta; for “due 
process of law” is but a paraphrase of “the law of the 
land,” without which no freeman could be deprived of his 
liberties or possessions. 
“Due process of law” means that there are certain funda- 
mental principles of liberty, not defined or even enumerated 
in the Constitution, but having their sanction in the free 
and enlightened conscience of just men, and that no man 
can be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except in con- 
formity with these fundamental decencies of liberty. To 
protect these even against the will of majority, however 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
JAMES M. BECK 229 
large, the judiciary was given unprecedented powers. It 
threw about the individual the solemn circle of the law. 
It made the judiciary the final conscience of the nation. 
England cherishes the same primal verities of liberty, but 
with the very substantial difference that in England the 
people in Parliament are the final judge. The Constitution 
was not content that a majority of the Legislature or even 
of the people should override inviolable individual rights 
about which the judiciary is empowered to throw the sol- 
emn circle of the law. 
A very profound student of governmental institutions, 
Sir Henry Maine, attributes the amazing prosperity of 
America to a considerable extent to this inviolability of 
property rights, which, in their last analysis, are personal 
rights. He says: 
All this beneficent prosperity reposes on the sacredness of con- 
tract and the stability of private property; the first the imple- 
ment, and the last the reward of success in the universal competi- 
tion. 
He adds that the contract clause has been “the bulwark 
of American individualism against democratic impatience 
and socialistic fantasy.” 
This august power has won the admiration of the world, 
and by many is regarded as a novel contribution to the 
science of government. The idea, however, was not 
wholly novel. As previously shown, four Chief Justices 
of England had intimated that an Act of Parliament, if 
against common right and reason, might be treated as 
null and void; while in France the power of the judiciary to 
refuse efficacy to a law, unless sanctioned by the judiciary, 
had been the cause of a long struggle for at least three cen- 
turies between the French monarch and the courts of 
France. However, in England the doctrine of the common 
law yielded to the later doctrine of the omnipotence of 
Parliament, while in France the revisory power of the 
judiciary was terminated by the French Revolution. 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
    280 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION 
The United States, however, embodied it in its form of 
government and thus made the judiciary, and especially 
the Supreme Court, the balance wheel of the Constitution. 
Without such power the Constitution could never have 
lasted, for neither executive officers nor legislatures are 
good judges of the extent of their own powers. 
Nothing more strikingly shows the spirit of unity which 
the Constitution brought into being than the unbroken 
success with which the Supreme Court has discharged this 
difficult and most delicate duty. The President is the 
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Navy and can 
call them to his aid. The legislature has almost unlimited 
power through its control of the public purse. The States 
have their power reinforced by armed forces, and some of 
them are as great in population and resources as many of 
the nations of Europe. The Supreme Court, however, has 
only one officer to execute its decrees, called the United 
States Marshal; and yet, when the Supreme Court, without 
sword or purse, and with only a high sheriff to enforce its 
mandates, says to a President or to a Congress or to the 
authorities of a great — and, in some respects, sovereign — 
State that they must do this or must refrain from doing 
that, the mandate is at once obeyed. Here, indeed, is the 
American ideal of “‘a government of laws and not of men” 
most strikingly realized; and if the American Constitution, 
as formulated and developed, had done nothing else than to 
establish in this manner the supremacy of law, even as 
against the overwhelming sentiment of the people, it 
would have justified the well-known encomium of Mr. 
Gladstone.

THE CITY-REPUBLIC! 
FREDERICK C. HOWE 
Tus program of municipal home rule contemplates that 
the city shall be as free from the state as the state is free 
from the nation at large. It would relieve the municipality 
from state interference in all matters of purely local con- 
cern. It would divorce the locality from the interests 
which now animate the state in its legislation, and secure 
to the city the right to adopt its own charter, just as the 
people of the state now adopt their own constitution. It 
would authorize the people of a city to call a constitutional 
convention, made up of delegates from the several wards, 
with power to adopt, alter, or amend the fundamental laws 
of the community; to determine what powers may be exer- 
cised, as well as the means of raising and expending revenue. 
Under existing conditions the city cannot act as to its 
tenement or building laws, its parkage, its public baths, its 
civil service regulations; it cannot raise revenues as it will, 
or expend them, save as the state has ordered. The city 
cannot regulate the charges of the local companies for gas, 
electricity, or telephone service, save under authority 
delegated from the legislature; it cannot receive gifts, 
punish offenders, inspect conditions of labor in factories, 
cannot even pay the rate of wages that it wishes, or deter- 
mine the classification or discharge of employees. Under 
the present system of state control, the city enjoys only 
such powers as the state may have granted to it. Nor has 
it any rights which the state need respect. It cannot move 
beyond the limitations of the state law, cannot even pro-

232 THE CITY-REPUBLIC 
tect itself, much less work out the solution of its own pro- 
blems. All these things, large as well as small, are the sub- 
ject of legislative control. The result is a series of legal 
limitations, designed for every event, a lowering down of 
responsibility, and a system of government which is wholly 
inelastic to the needs of those seeking reform. 
If our analysis of conditions has been correct, the 
trouble with our citizens is not too much democracy, but 
too little democracy; not too little state supervision, but 
too much state supervision. We have placed our cities in 
strait-jackets, and then expected them to develop strength 
and character. We have deprived them of self-government 
and then wondered why self-government was a failure. 
Under home rule, as suggested, the city of Chicago could 
purchase and operate its street-railway system, construct 
a sewage canal, or carry out its parking system without 
reference to the state. The city of New York could erect 
an electric-lighting plant, change its police, and treat the 
excise and Sunday-closing questions according to the will 
of the community, and not according to the prejudice of 
the rural assemblymen. Local option, even the state- 
dispensary system, would be open to trial if desired by the 
community. Under home rule uniformity would give 
place to individuality, and the special legislation would be 
at an end. 
Home rule would create a city-republic, a new sort of 
sovereignty, a republic like unto those of Athens, Rome, 
and the medieval Italian cities, a republic related to the 
state as the states are now related to the nation at large. 
And it is a significant thing that the great cities of the 
world, the cities in which the talent, pride, and energy of 
the people have been able to respond to its ideals, have 
been cities enjoying a large measure of liberty. It was 
freedom that inspired in these cities local love and patriot- 
ism as in no other communities the world has seen. Fora 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
FREDERICK C. HOWE 233 
city isa conscious thing. Were it not so the results already 
achieved would have been impossible. It is a common- 
place in the business world that American industry has 
reached its splendid development through just this sort of 
freedom, the freedom to incorporate, to organize, to do 
what it will without bureaucratic interference and super- 
vision. In every realm of life the achievements of the hu- 
man mind are in direct proportion to its sense of freedom, 
of responsibility. Just as childhood grows to strength 
through independence and the desire of self-achievement, 
so life develops in response to the burdens which freedom 
imposes. The same psychological motives move govern- 
ment. And were the responsibilities of local administration 
thrown down upon the shoulders of the people, unrestrained 
by state interference, the people would respond, and in time 
there would be created a sense of local patriotism which 
would raise the American city from its present decadence to 
a position of splendid achievement. 
In such a city-republic the official would be close to the 
public which he serves. And this is to be desired, for 
government is efficient in direct proportion to the scrutiny 
of the public, whose disapproval it fears, and whose appro- 
bation and honor it delights to receive. In such a city 
public opinion would be free to act without that tardy 
resort to the legislature that now paralyzes initiative. 
The effect of such a change would be to create a sense of 
intimacy with the city on the part of the pcople. The 
citizens would find their problems simplified. To-day the 
burden of reform in many cities is found in the antiquated 
sumptuary and excise laws passed by the state and ap- 
plied to the cities. It was this that brought defeat in New 
York. Pledged to an honest enforcement of the laws, the 
Low administration was opposed and ultimately deserted 
by a large class of otherwise law-abiding citizens, whose 
foreign-bred or instinctive feelings of liberty and personal  
-P-A-G-E-240
234 THE CITY-REPUBLIC 
  freedom were violated by a rigorous enforcement of the 
Sunday-closing laws. And this feeling is fundamental to 
many people. We cannot hope to compel the population 
of our cities, the majority of whom are foreign-born, to 
accept the earlier conception of the Sabbath upon which 
our state laws are based. Local reform, under present 
conditions, will always have this burden to carry. And 
the result will be a sacrifice of the substance of reform to a 
legislative tyranny in the realm of personal morals. Under 
home rule the excise question can be determined by the 
city, and thus eliminated from state politics. And with 
its elimination the elements of reform, now at odds over 
this issue, can join hands over larger ones of municipal and 
administrative betterment. The same is true of the great 
economic issues centering about taxation, the tenement, 
public ownership, and the regulation of corporate abuses. 
These issues are unknown to the rural districts. Condi- 
tions of life in the country are simple. In the city they are 
complex. And the city can only evolve a solution of these 
problems fitted to the evil. In this the state can offer 
little aid. 
Moreover, with the city freed from the nation and the 
state, party leaders and public officials would be forced to 
consider their constituents, rather than the party organi- 
zations upon which they now rely for protection. No 
longer could the party in control in the city relieve itself 
from responsibility by laying the burden upon the party 
in control of the state. There would then come a real 
responsibility, a government dependent for support upon 
the constituency which it served. 
This agitation for home rule is but part of a larger move- 
ment. It is more than a cry for charter reform; more even 
than a revolt against the misuse of the municipality by the 
legislature. It partakes of a struggle for liberty, and its 
aim is the enlargement of democracy and a substitution of 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
PS SM a Nag ERR fe ne ee Ee ER eT Grae Sen ce NPT Te Pe ene 
FREDERICK C. HOWE 235 
simpler conditions of government. It is a demand on the 
part of the people to be trusted, and to be endowed with 
the privileges of which they have been dispossessed. Our 
cities are coming to believe that local matters can be best 
administered by local agencies. As well try to regulate the 
tariff or administer colonial dependencies through one of 
our cities, as to attempt to regulate the city’s functions, its 
schools, streets, fire and police departments through the 
state. 
As to the proper delineation of state and city functions, 
there may be debatable ground upon which men will differ. 
And these activities may change from time to time. But 
there are certain functions whose place is naturally and 
readily determined. The administration of justice, the 
care of criminal, insane, and dangerous classes; the pro- 
- motion of higher education, and highways, the surveillance 
of corporations, are naturally state functions, and should 
be administered by the state at large. But the form of the 
city charter, the powers of the mayor and the council, the 
- question of whether a community should lease its streets 
to a private corporation or make use of them itself are 
matters of purely local concern. So is the method of ad- 
ministering the police and fire departments, the city’s 
schools, the libraries, and health of the city. This is true 
of all the functions which are local in their nature. The 
state at large can have no more interest in such matters 
than it has in the methods employed by the corporations 
which it creates. Its credit could not be involved by home 
tule, nor could its officials be embarrassed. On the con- 
trary, the work of the legislature would be greatly reduced, 
while the real functions and powers of the state would be- 
come clear. 
The same is true of taxation. It is a matter of no con- 
cern to Congress whether the state raises its revenues from 
income or from license taxes, from real estate or from cor-   
 
-P-A-G-E-242
    236 THE CITY-REPUBLIC 
porations. And the state has no more interest in the city 
than the nation has in the state. Moreover, local condi- 
tions differ. If one city sees fit to levy a tax upon land 
values alone, upon franchises, or upon incomes, it should 
be permitted to exercise its discretion. 
Home rule would produce variety in municipal adminis- 
tration, rather than uniformity. We should thus have in 
every state a number of experiment stations of administra- 
tion, taxation, and social betterment, each seeking a solu- 
tion of its local problem and each contributing to the politi- 
cal experience of the country. In education the same thing 
is true. New York and Cincinnati have entered into the 
field of higher education, and maintain metropolitan col- 
leges. The city of Cincinnati has built the Cincinnati 
Southern Railway to save its business interests from the 
tyranny of railway monopoly. New York and Boston 
have constructed subways and entered on an extensive 
development of parks, docks, recreation, and education. 
Variety, not uniformity, is what we need. For we might 
as well try to clothe all mankind in the same size and style 
of clothes as to compress all cities within the same charter 
rubrics. 
In addition to all these gains, the divorce of the munici- 
pality from the state would strike at the power of the boss. 
The city would then be able to divest itself of the dominion 
of selfish interests. No longer would the dual system which 
now governs the city from the state capital or Washington 
be able to traffic in franchise privileges, either owned by 
the boss or traded in by him in exchange for campaign 
contributions, legal retainers, or legislative bribes. 
In fine, home rule is but an attempt to regain those pow- 
ers which the state has assumed, but which were originally 
enjoyed by the local community. We still have a survival 
of this idea in the town meetings of New England, which 
are jealously guarded by the people. Home rule aims to
-P-A-G-E-243
FREDERICK C. HOWE 237 
reclaim to the city those functions of government which 
passed into the hands of the state at a time when the city 
was coming into existence, or which have been assumed by 
the state at the demand of the boss or the party. It would 
place the responsibility on those who suffer by bad or 
would be benefited by good government. To-day our tax 
rate is fixed by those who do not bear the burden, our 
streets are bartered away by persons who do not use them, 
our police, fire, and park departments are managed by 
legislators who know nothing of local conditions.

  THE FUTURE OF MILITARISM? 
G. LOWES DICKINSON 
Tue political relations of the European States have con- 
sisted for centuries past of war and preparation for war. 
In the present war, this practice has culminated in a catas- 
trophe which, it might seem, must lead to a reaction. 
Perhaps it may. But it certainly will not do so, unless it 
be by a deliberate and conscious change in the ideas and 
the wills of men. Meantime people already talk of the 
‘'next war.” It is therefore important to make some fore- 
cast of what kind of a war that is likely to be, and, more 
generally, what kind of a future the continuation and ex- 
tension of militarism would prepare for mankind. 
A Russian general, Skugarewski, has recently attempted 
a forecast of the next war, which he anticipates in ten or 
twenty years, if Germany is not “conclusively conquered.” 
He starts by remarking that every war he can remember, 
beginning from the Crimean War, was an “unprecedented” 
war; and his moral is that “humanity must at last learn 
how to prepare for war.” “In the future struggle of na- 
tions all men capable of bearing arms will be taken into the 
ranks of the nations’ armies, and for them everything will 
be ready in peace-time.” This will mean that Russia will 
have an army of forty millions and Germany of twenty 
millions. For an army of forty million men three hundred 
thousand officers will be required. To secure them “‘it 
will be necessary to introduce conscription for officers: all 
young men who have received not even complete middle- 
school education will be obliged to serve as officers.”

  242 THE FUTURE OF MILITARISM 
Further, it will be necessary to replace, so far as possible, 
by women the men who under existing arrangements are 
kept in the rear by non-combatant duties. Perhaps there- 
fore “it will be necessary to introduce conscription for 
girls and childless widows, so that more men can be sent to 
the front.” As to armaments, “there will be required for 
such an army one hundred thousand guns, a million max- 
ims, tens of thousands of motor cars, armoured, freight, and 
light cars. By the beginning of the war at least fifty mil- 
lion gun-projectiles must be prepared, and five thousand 
million rifle cartridges. Besides machine-gun detachments, 
each company of a regiment will have its portable machine 
guns on light stands.” Aviation, of course, “will receive 
special development.” “It is clear that in ten to twenty 
years every State will reckon the numbers of its dirigibles 
in thousands and the number of its aeroplanes in tens, 
if not hundreds of thousands. The dropping of shells 
from above on to large stretches of country will be ex- 
tensively practised. And if the laws of war permit the 
application of inflammable materials and substances for 
the development of poisonous gases, then the raids of 
aerial flotillas will instantly convert large districts of 
several square versts into complete deserts where every 
vestige of animal and vegetable life wil be slain and 
where large units of armies will be annihilated to a single 
man.” The range of guns will be enormously increased 
and “perhaps Dover will be shelled from Calais.” The 
general proceeds to estimate the cost of such a war at 
twenty millions a day. The peace establishment of Russia 
will cost a hundred millions a year. 
“Besides the existing material conscriptions, it may per- 
haps be necessary to introduce conscription for grain, meat, 
and fodder. All industrial establishments — mills, facto- 
ries, workshops, even handicraftsmen — on declaration of 
war will have to work for the army in accordance with a
-P-A-G-E-249
  G. LOWES DICKINSON 248 
special plan of mobilization.” In short, “expedients for 
the extermination of humanity will be of such a nature that 
everything of which we hear nowadays will pale in com- 
parison. The number of killed will be reckoned by mil- 
lions, of wounded by tens of millions.” 
This is not a romance by Mr. Wells. It is a very sober 
description, certainly not overdrawn, of what is likely to 
occur in that “next war” to which so many people are al- 
ready looking forward. Let us carry the description a little 
further. 
And, first, as to methods of war. It is as probable as 
anything can be that these will be of a kind which will 
make the worst that has been done in this war seem by com- 
parison like humanity and kindness. Not only will every 
weapon that has been used in this war be employed in the 
next, except those that have been rendered obsolete by the 
invention of worse ones, but science will have discovered 
new and far more destructive means of murder. We have 
long applied chemistry to war; but we have not begun to 
apply bacteriology. In the future, the deliberate spread of 
lethal diseases among the enemy is likely to be a principal 
and recognized method of destruction. Further the war 
will be waged, without any restriction, on non-combatants. 
Already a German professor has written a book to show 
that this is permitted by the ‘new ” law of nations, created 
by the experiences of this war. And, of course, the logic of 
war is in favour of it. For a munition-worker, or a pro- 
ducer of any kind, is just as much helping the enemy to 
win the war as a soldier at the front. 
We must therefore expect that in any future war any 
and every weapon of extermination will be used freely 
against non-combatants as well as combatants. Rules of 
war may be drawn up to prevent this. But the issues of a 
modern war are so tremendous, that such rules are likely 
to break at the first tension put upon them. One comba-

tant succumbs to one temptation, another to another. 
Each breach of the law by one is followed by breaches by 
the others, under guise of reprisals. Neither religion, 
morals, nor humanity have availed to arrest this process in 
the present war. Why should we suppose they will be 
more potent in the future? 
But destruction by war does not end with the lives of the 
immediate sufferers. Every man of sound stock who is 
killed childless extinguishes with himself whole generations. 
But it is the sound that are killed in war, and the unsound 
preserved, for it is the sound that are selected to go to the 
front. Further, among those that survive, men and women, 
the conditions of war tend to disseminate over wider and 
wider areas venereal and other diseases, and this again 
reacts upon the stock. So that, whoever wins or loses the 
war, winners and losers alike have impaired irremediably 
the strength of their nation. War may preserve liberty for 
posterity, but it is a posterity weakened and enfeebled that 
will enjoy it. 
War, then, means not merely the destruction of the best 
among the living, but an irreparable impoverishment of 
the race; and that on a scale proportional to the scale of the 
war. But the scale of modern wars is world-wide. So, 
therefore, is the impoverishment. War is a way of racial 
suicide. Soldiers and statesmen do not think of such re- 
mote effects; but they do not cease to happen because they 
are not thought of. And in comparison with them victory 
or defeat, and the other results of war, are negligible in the 
balance. : 
Let us turn now from the biological to the social effects 
of war. War implies preparation for war. And if the 
international anarchy is to continue, so that States are 
compelled to arm against one another, each driving on each 
to ever more tremendous efforts, there can be no pause in 
the process and no limit to it. We have no right to dis-
-P-A-G-E-251
G. LOWES DICKINSON 245 
miss as improbable, still less as impossible, any extremity 
that lies in the logic of the movement. Let us therefore 
without shrinking develop that logic to the full. 
First, universal service will be introduced as a permanent 
institution into the countries that have hitherto escaped it; 
and it is probable that it will be organized on the complete 
Prussian model. There are, I am aware, some who look 
forward to what they call a “popular” army, such as is 
maintained in Switzerland and was proposed for France 
by Jaurés. Their idea is, first, that an army may be or- 
ganized for defence only, and not for offence. Secondly, 
that it may be so organized that it cannot become the in- 
strument of a military caste. A full discussion of these 
points is not possible here; but there are one or two ob- 
vious considerations which must be borne in mind. In the 
first place, there is not, and cannot be, any clear and uni- 
versally accepted distinction between offence and defence, 
until there is an international agreement as to what shall 
constitute offence. Every nation in every war that I have 
ever heard of has claimed to be on the defensive. The 
mere act of declaring war, or of taking the first step in war, 
cannot be accepted as proof of aggression, for it may be 
merely a reasonable precaution of defence. It may be 
urged that the act of invasion should be the test of offence, 
and that an army of defence must never cross the frontier. 
But would any military authority accept that view? And, 
in particular, is it applicable to this country, where in any 
future war the transport of an army to the Continent will 
be the first necessity, if any of our continental allies are also 
involved? The Territorials were enlisted for home de- 
fence; and we see what has come of that, under the first 
pressure of war. The distinction, then, between an army 
for offence and an army for defence is unreal and must re- 
main unreal, unless and until we have a system of inter- 
national agreements and guarantees which would trans- 
form the whole situation out of which wars arise.
-P-A-G-E-252
    246 THE FUTURE OF MILITARISM 
Secondly, whatever organization be adopted for an 
army, however short the period to be spent in barracks, 
however democratic the method of recruiting and promo- 
tion, it does not seem possible that a force on the modern 
scale of numbers and efficiency could be maintained without 
the aid of a very large class of professional officers, and 
without giving to these a large measure of social prestige 
and political influence. The British tradition, whereby the 
officer rarely appears in uniform, and is not felt in time of 
peace as an element in society or in politics, must disappear, 
it would seem, with the permanent adoption of universal 
service. The more numerous, highly-trained, and intelli- 
gent the officer caste, the more influential they will be- 
come. And as they will be trained exclusively for war, and 
will regard war both as their own sole business and as the 
sole business of the nation, they are not likely to abstain 
from bringing their influence to bear upon foreign policy. 
But such political influence of an officer caste is precisely 
one of the most important elements in militarism. And 
the moment officers begin to wear their uniforms in time of 
peace will be the moment when militarism starts to run its 
course in England. 
In any case, whatever form of military organization be 
adopted, we shall have everywhere universal service; and 
that, as General Skugarewski foresees, on a scale hitherto 
unknown in history. Every man between the ages, let us 
say, of seventeen and fifty, will be liable to military service. 
Boys under seventeen will have compulsory “preliminary 
training” as boy scouts, in officers’ training corps, and the 
like. Women and girls will be enrolled for the various non- 
combatant services — unless indeed, which is quite pos- 
sible, it be decided to raise combatant corps of amazons. 
In any case, the question of the fitness of people for mili- 
tary service, in character or temperament or conviction, 
will not enter into consideration. In the past, in pagan so-
-P-A-G-E-253
  G. LOWES DICKINSON 247 
cieties — ancient India, for example, or Japan — men were 
selected as soldiers by their own choice or by hereditary 
aptitude. In the twentieth century of Him who came to 
bring peace among mankind, we do not hesitate to compel 
all men into the army without reference to their aptitude 
or choice, and in defiance of their moral, religious, or politi- 
cal scruples. Thus, as conscription extends, so does the 
necessity of persecution. And if international war is to 
continue, persecution will be established as an institution 
in all countries. 
Having forced the men (and the women it may be) into 
the army, the next thing will be to train them. What the 
object of military training is was once summed up as fol- 
lows by a military officer. “The one object,” he said, “of 
a military system is to overcome a man’s natural reluctance 
to kill and to be killed. To accomplish this we have three 
devices. The first is to make the soldier more afraid of his 
own officers than he is of the enemy. The second is to con- 
vert him into an automaton by perpetual drill, so that he 
obeys instinctively every order given without any inter- 
vention of his own choice or will. The third device is a 
just cause.” This last device is rather the business of the 
politicians than the soldiers, and it is one they very well 
understand. As to the others there seems to be some ques- 
tion, in modern warfare, as to the extent to which it is 
necessary to destroy the soldier’s individuality. But it can 
hardly be doubtful that the more it is possible to overcome 
beforehand, not only his reluctance to kill and to be killed, 
but his squeamishness as to methods of killing, the better 
soldier he will be. And we may expect developments in 
this direction which would surprise and shock our present 
susceptibilities, formed, as they have been, in and for 
peace. 
But to make a nation efficient for war it will not be 
enough to conscript the whole population, to train them in
-P-A-G-E-254
  248 THE FUTURE OF MILITARISM 
the use of any and every weapon, and to counteract their 
humane instincts. Much more important will be the re- 
ligious and moral training. The soul as well as the body 
of a good soldier must be militarized; and for this purpose 
a new direction must be given to the State religion. Ex- 
actly how revolutionary the change must be it is not easy 
to say. The attitude of the clergy in the present war has 
shown that the apparent teaching of the Gospels need not 
interfere with an enthusiastic support of war by ministers 
of a Christian Church; and that, in the view of many, the 
dispensation of Jesus left standing in full authority that of 
the God of the Jews. ‘The Sermon on the Mount, we have 
been told in effect, was merely a string of amiable meta- 
phors. The real Jesus Whom we are to treat as our Master 
was the one Who used the scourge of small cords in the 
Temple, not the one who bade us turn the other cheek. 
When He said, “Greater love hath no man than this, that 
he give his life for his friend,” what He meant was that we 
are to kill our enemies. And when He said, ‘‘ Render unto 
Cesar the things that are Cesar’s,” He already by antic- 
ipation condemned those who, in the future, in His name, 
might refuse military service. This adaptability of Chris- 
tianity, as professed by the Churches, suggests that its 
forms might still be preserved even in an era of universal 
militarism. Nor need we be troubled by the fact that Chris- 
tianity is a universal religion, and that all Christians are 
supposed to worship the same God. For we have seen 
also, in this war, that each nation can claim, with the full 
support of its Church, that its national god is really the 
universal god; so that Christian nations may not only 
fight against one another with a good conscience, but each 
may be sure, in so doing, that it is fighting for the true God, 
Who is being denied by its enemies. 
There seems, then, on the whole, good reason to think 
that the forms of Christianity may still continue to direct
-P-A-G-E-255
G. LOWES DICKINSON 249 
the militaristic societies of the future. At the same time 
we must make no mistake about the reality. The real 
religion of the future, if war is to continue, will be the re- 
ligion of the God-State; for the essential requirement will 
be an unquestioning submission to the will of the State. 
It is this that has given such moral strength to the Ger- 
mans in the present war, and the fact will be noted and its 
lesson applied by other nations.

INTERNATIONALISM ! 
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 
I swat discuss here internationalism, not pacifism. The 
latter seems to me to overemphasize the negative aspect of 
the campaign against war; and antimilitarism would seem 
the better word to designate that movement. I do not re- 
ject pacifism or antimilitarism, but to my mind they havea 
special meaning. Pacifism denotes an ethical theory — I 
should take it to signify moral protest against violence. 
Usually a pacifist, particularly in these days, is an inter- 
nationalist, and vice versa; but history affords examples of 
pacifists who had no conception of internationalism. Jesus 
was a pacifist, but his words, so far as they are known to us, 
indicate that internationalism was foreign to his thought, 
simply because He did not deal with political concepts. 
If we were to classify Him in the categories of our age, we 
should have to define Him as an antimilitarist and an 
anarchist-individualist. 
Internationalism is a social and political conception that 
looks toward reorganizing human society and establishing 
a new basis of intercourse between nations. 
Nationalism and internationalism seem to be opposed to 
each other, because they interpret differently the laws of 
human evolution. They are antagonistic in matters of 
everyday political policy. But upon profounder analysis 
they are seen to converge in a higher unity. Nationalism 
intelligently understood is a step toward internationalism, 
and internationalism is based, as its name indicates, upon 
the existence of nations. It seeks merely to limit them to

-P-A-G-E-257
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 251 
more modest functions than aggressive nationalists claim. 
Jaurés said rightly: “Superficial internationalism alienates 
a man from his country; profound internationalism leads 
him back to it.” 
On the other hand, nationalism and cosmopolitanism 
are fundamentally antagonistic. Cosmopolitanism over- 
looks the differences between nations, while internation- 
alism recognizes those differences as inevitable, and favors 
a high degree of national specialization. 
Internationalism, like every social theory, must justify 
itself by economic utility. That is where we must seek the 
crucial justification of every social organism. Other for- 
mative forces may exist. There was a time when religious 
beliefs shaped social institutions. Certain intellectual cur- 
rents help to mould our social forms, but only in a sec- 
ondary and minor way. ‘The factors that determine these 
forms to-day are division of labor, transportation, and 
intellectual intercourse. 
Ethnography and history teach us that society has 
passed through successive stages of evolution determined 
primarily by economic conditions: the horde, whose mem- 
bers lived from day to day; the canton or city, where divi- 
sion of labor existed to a limited extent; the territorial state 
or empire, where division of labor and exchange of pro- 
ducts existed on a larger scale. As soon as economic and 
technical evolution reach a certain point, new forces re- 
shape society into political forms accommodated to this 
progress. Such political transformations always cause 
bitter conflicts. The past dies hard. The political rulers 
of the day seldom yield gracefully to the necessities of a 
new age. Poetical and religious sentiment entwine them- 
selves around traditional institutions; emotional impulses 
oppose themselves to the practical and prosaic exigencies 
of the up-to-date. In the bosom of every social group pal- 
pitate sentiments of solidarity, codperation, spontaneous 
loyalty. These sentiments have a high ethical value. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  252 INTERNATIONALISM 
Oftentimes they are nourished by religion, which is usually 
a legendary and mystical expression of the group soul. 
War within the group is a crime; war against other groups 
is a sacred duty. 
The world finds itself just now in a period of rapid 
transition. We are changing from a society organized by 
state units into a society organized on a world basis. Po- 
litically our epoch is still dominated by the principle of the 
territorial state; economically and technically we are al- 
ready living in an age of international communication and 
world markets. 
The territorial state is an ancient social form. It is a 
thousand years old in Europe. It is venerable in its antiq- 
uity and glorious in its traditions. We are conscious of a 
religious respect and devotion for the country of our an- 
cestors. The modern territorial state would justify itself 
by this national sentiment. It fancies that this is its en- 
during spiritual principle. But historically nationa! senti- 
ment, patriotism, and even nationality itself are effects, and 
not causes, of the state. That was universally true of the 
states formed prior to the nineteenth century. Only in our 
own day have political boundaries in Europe been con- 
sciously drawn to accord with national sentiment. The 
peace treaties following the World War in several in- 
stances traced new frontiers in response to purely national 
considerations. 
It is significant that this has happened just when we be- 
gin to realize that the territorial state no longer satisfies the 
economic and technical necessities of our age. That only 
proves the more clearly that we are passing through a pe- 
riod of transition. The nationalist movement has reached 
its apogee at the very moment when it ceases to be suffi- 
cient for the hour. Technical progress no longer recog- 
nizes economic frontiers. It has developed the machinery 
of transportation to a point where it has created a world 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 253 
market; that is to say, the world has already become one 
nation from the point of view of division of labor-—a 
nation embracing every civilized state with a settled form 
of government, and even most of the so-called noncivilized 
peoples. This has produced an interdependence among 
nations that from the economic standpoint is the most 
striking feature of our age. 
Hardly less characteristic is the intellectual interdepend- 
ence resulting from modern facilities for exchanging ideas 
and information; from post offices, telegraphs and tele- 
phones, and a popular press. The simultaneous reaction 
produced throughout the world by reading newspapers 
containing identical dispatches is the mental rhythm of 
civilized mankind. People read the same news at the same 
time from San Francisco to Tokyo, and from Melbourne to 
Hammerfest. They react to it differently — most for- 
tunately — but simultaneously. 
Politics always trail behind social evolution. They are 
the rear guard of progress. Their mission is to devise 
governmental institutions accommodated to ideas that are 
already matured, that have become living realities in ap- 
plied science, social economy, and intellectual life. Hjal- 
mar Branting, the Socialist Premier of Sweden, defined ex- 
cellently the mission of internationalism in a telegram to 
the Nobel Committee as “the urge toward a higher form 
of world civilization.” 
The Great War has shown how indispensable it is that 
this urge should carry us to its goal. That is a matter of 
life or death for contemporary civilization. Europe could 
not survive another war. But, if the territorial state re- 
mains the last word in social revolution, war is inevitable. 
The state, from the very nature of its being, asserts sover- 
eignty — that is to say, the right to use its power without 
limit for its purely selfish ends. Fundamentally the state 
is anarchist. The right it claims — the theoretical, un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  254 INTERNATIONALISM 
limited right — to make war on other states is antisocial, 
and this right is doubly dangerous, because the state, so 
far as it is controlled by the passions of the crowd, repre- 
sents a low intellectual level. Psychology teaches us that 
the masses acting together have a distinctly lower level of 
intelligence and morality than the individuals who compose 
them. 
That is why our hope for a better future depends on the 
success of “the urge toward a higher form of world civiliza- 
tion.” Are we justified in anticipating that success? Ought 
we to believe that a good and generous will guides the de- 
stinies of people, and is leading us toward a higher stage of 
social evolution? In practice we involuntarily assume this. 
This appeals to the natural optimism of mankind. To 
the eyes of faith the Valley of the Shadow of Death is but 
a stage of the journey toward mountains of bliss beyond. 
But if we pause here we merely hope. Hope is not cer- 
tainty. History tells us that in the past high civilizations 
have perished. Who knows if the same fate is not reserved 
for our own? 
Is there, then, a scientific basis for predicting with rea- 
sonable certainty the ultimate history of internationalism? 
For thousands of years dreamers and thinkers have pro- 
claimed the unity of mankind. Greek philosophers, no- 
tably the Stoics, formulated that theory. Primitive 
Christianity converted it into a moral and religious dogma 
that found expression in the doctrine: the Fatherhood of 
God and the brotherhood of man. 
The same thought reappeared as a scientific theory in 
the works of many authors at the dawn of modern times — 
for instance, the German heretic, Sebastian Franck, the 
Spanish Jesuit Suarez, who was one of the founders of 
modern international law, and Amos Comenius, the last 
Bishop of the Moravian Brothers and the pioneer of modern 
pedagogy. Comenius even gave the theory a physiological
-P-A-G-E-261
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 255 
interpretation. He wrote in his Panergesia, published in 
1645: “All individuals of our race form, so to speak, a 
single body, whose members are coherent.” This idea has 
persisted ever since. It dominated the better minds of the 
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, from 
William Penn and Leibnitz to the Norwegian Wergeland 
and the American thinker Emerson. In our own times 
biology has supplied a scientific basis for this hypothesis. 
The unity of the human race is a biological fact. The re- 
searches of Weismann, upon the genus Medusa, in 1883, 
opened the way. Other scientists have proved that Weis- 
mann’s law is equally applicable to other genera, including 
the human species, and that each of us is literally and phys- 
iologically a link in the long, unbroken chain that forms 
humanity 
No comparison is perfect, but I am accustomed to con- 
ceive the human race as a great, vigorous tree, with in- 
numerable branches and twigs, to which the individuals 
are attached like leaves and flowers and fruit. They lead 
their individual and almost independent lives; they bud, 
germinate, change, grow old, die. The tree remains with 
its branches, boughs, and twigs, ceaselessly reproducing 
new leaves and flowers and fruit. Their life is brief and 
personal. Many leaves die and fall to the ground unper- 
ceived. Blossoms come that rejoice us with their per- 
fume and their color; fruits mature that nourish and for- 
tify. The leaves, the flowers, the fruit appear and vanish 
in countless numbers, but the tree persists intact. Thus 
humanity remains a single individual organism. 
During the World War two scientists, belonging to the 
two opposing sides, developed the same doctrine and 
worked out in detail its scientific proof: Chalmers Mitchell 
in his Evolution and the War, and Professor C. F. Nicolai in 
his Biology of War. Without stopping to discuss the ap- 
plications of this fundamental principle that these authors  
-P-A-G-E-262
  256 : INTERNATIONALISM : 
made, I shall content myself with presenting only one of 
their conclusions: If the human race is a biological unit, 
then war, whether international or civil, is suicide. It isa 
debasement, a profanation of the human race. 
Thus internationalism is supported even more conclu- 
sively by science than it is by sociological reasoning. Nor 
is it difficult to see whither this theory leads us. Its ap- 
plications in the field of economics are evident. We have 
already suggested them. They lead directly to international 
solidarity, a division of labor embracing the whole globe. 
Free trade is one of the first doctrines they teach. 
This thesis, furthermore, agrees with the most recent 
discoveries of natural science. We have learned that 
union, solidarity, and mutual aid are all important factors 
in the survival of species. Species that practice this virtue 
have more chance of survival in the struggle of existence 
than those whose individual members act separately. 
Wolves who live in troops survive better than lions who 
hunt alone. This truth has been developed and illustrated 
by numerous examples in Kropotkin’s Mutual Aid, in 
which the author applies to sociology laws drawn from 
natural history. 
Let me here develop a little further the effect of interna- 
tionalism upon political institutions. It favors the growth 
’ of organic social forms, expressing the principles of soli- 
darity and codperation among people. To evolvesuch forms 
and apply them practically is the great political mission of 
our age. The past is intrenched behind state sovereignty, 
protective tariffs, militarism. It clings to the optical 
illusion that makes it seem that the individual citizen is 
happier if his government annexes new territories, if his 
country is entirely self-sufficing and does not depend on 
other countries for commodities and merchandise. Eco- 
nomic protectionism was first developed by the American, 
Alexander Hamilton, one of the authors of the Constitution
-P-A-G-E-263
  
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 257 
of the United States, and later by the German, Friedrich 
List, who transplanted the doctrine from America, where 
he long resided, to Europe. 
Intimately associated with national protectionism is 
militarism, which differs only by unappreciable shadings 
in different countries. A nation is more or less militarist 
according to the degree to which its foreign and domestic 
policy is shaped by strategic considerations. The classical 
example of a militarist government was the Prusso-German 
Empire, especially during the World War. At bottom, 
militarism is a mode of thinking, a way of conceiving the 
state and its functions, which expresses itself in armaments 
and in every detail, even the minutest, of a country’s ad- 
ministrative organization. 
Internationalism challenges this conception of the sover- 
eign state with its accompaniments, protectionism and 
militarism. The sovereign state has become in our time a 
mortal danger for civilization, because the development of 
applied science has placed at its disposal new and more 
powerful instruments of destruction. Engineering, like 
fire, is a useful servant but a dangerous master; and it is 
the nature of militarism that the mechanism it creates 
eventually becomes the master of the people. The terrible 
armaments of a modern government are a source of con- 
stant danger for that government, as well as for its neigh- 
bors, and in the long run for civilization. When we look at 
the subject from this point of view we perceive the supreme 
importance of disarmament. It is more than a mere coun- 
sel of economy, to prevent unproductive expenditures. It 
goes deeper, to the very principle of civilization, and seeks 
to eliminate the temptation and the power to pursue arbi- 
trary and anarchistic international policies. 
If the state were wholly selfish, if it expressed itself only 
in economic protectionism and in militarism, then inter- 
nationalism would win an easy victory. But the state is
-P-A-G-E-264
    258 INTERNATIONALISM 
also founded on a principle of a spiritual order. It repre- 
sents national individuality, a particular branch of the 
human race. 
I said above that in most governments the nation springs 
from the state, and not the state from the nation. When 
it is argued that nations are anthropological units — purely 
racial groups — the answer can safely be a categorical 
denial. No state has ever been inhabited by a pure race 
in the anthropological definition of the term. Scientific 
research proves that in every country there are infinite 
crossings between different elements of the population. 
There is no such thing as a pure race. Let me add that 
anthropological criteria — the shape of the skull, the char- 
acter of the hair, the coloration of the skin — are perfectly 
exact so far as they go; but we are totally ignorant of the 
spiritual and intellectual characteristics that accompany 
them. Yet nationality is nothing if it is not a spiritual 
phenomenon. Renan in his Qu’est-ce que c’est qu’une nation? 
has defined nationality adequately and completely: “A 
nation exists by virtue of a daily plebiscite.” The first 
phrase seems to reason in a circle. It is none the less a 
strict definition and entirely adequate, for it emphasizes 
the sense. That is how we must conceive nationality, 
which has no function outside this spiritual field. 
Internationalism does not seek to efface the spiritual as- 
pects of nationality. Quite the contrary, it would develop 
national specialization and guarantee its continued action 
and free evolution. That is precisely where international- 
ism differs from cosmopolitanism. The latter would efface 
or suppress national individuality, even in the domain of 
intellect and morals. Internationalism, on the other hand, 
recognizes that all spiritual and intellectual activities have 
their roots deep in national life. It is from this life that 
art and literature draw their vigor and originality — as do 
also the humanities, like history and linguistics.
-P-A-G-E-265
CHRISTIAN L. LANGE 259 
National evolution, in the spiritual and intellectual 
sphere, and specialization are perfectly reconcilable with 
internationalism. They are conditions essential for a rich 
and varied evolution of the race. 
On the other hand, internationalism would place the 
political control of matters of general interest to mankind 
in the hands of a single authority. Therefore, a federation 
of the world, in which the different nations would form 
autonomous states, is its political ideal. Before the war a 
first step had been taken in that direction at The Hague; 
but the League of Nations represents the first conscious 
and serious advance toward that goal. 
Internationalism, then, may be defined as follows: a 
social theory based on economic, spiritual, and biological 
facts. This theory affirms that the healthy development 
of society and of civilization requires the organization of 
the human race on an international basis. Nationalities 
should form the constituent elements of a great world- 
federation. They should be guaranteed the opportunity to 
live their own distinct spiritual and intellectual lives, and 
to control purely local functions, while political and eco- 
nomic questions should be dealt with by an agency of pacific 
codperation, in the common interests of all mankind.

THE PATHWAY OF PEACE? 
CHARLES E. HUGHES 
“War,” said Sir Henry Maine, “appears to be as old as 
mankind, but peace is a modern invention.” It is hardly 
that; it would seem to be an occasional experience, rather 
than an achievement. To one who reviews the history of 
strife from “the universal belligerency of primitive man- 
kind,” peace appears merely as the lull between inevitable 
storms always gathering in some quarter with the fateful 
recurrence of the operations of nature. Nineteen centuries 
of Christian faith, with its evangel of peace on earth and 
good will to men, with its sweet reasonableness and con- 
stant appeals through myriad activities to man’s highest 
hopes, have erected no effective barrier to war. It main- 
tains hospitals, it cares for the wounded and soothes the 
dying; it shines resplendent in countless lives of supreme 
self-sacrifice; but it leaves untouched the fields of carnage 
and unimpaired the justification of noble and generous 
spirits in the use of the most ruthless instrumentalities of 
destruction. The economic satisfactions proffered by an 
advancing civilization and dependent upon peace, the en- 
ticements of soft living, the hopes of families, the tenderest 
attachments, are all futile to oppose the summons to arms. 
The resources of science, all inventive skill, the long dis- 
cipline of the organization of trade and industry, every- 
thing that can be commanded in thought and action, in

recognize at once that war is not an abnormality. In the 
truest sense, it is not the mere play of brute force. It is 
the expression of the insistent human will, inflexible in its 
purpose. The culture of civilization has strengthened, not 
enfeebled it. It is the old human spirit with the latest 
equipment. As Winston Churchill has said of the “valiant 
spirit of man in the late war”: “Son of the Stone Age, 
vanquisher of nature with all her trials and monsters, he 
met the awful and self-inflicted agony with new reserves 
of fortitude. . .. His nervous system was found in the twen- 
tieth century capable of enduring physical and moral 
stresses before which the simpler natures of primeval times 
would have collapsed. Again and again to the hideous 
bombardment, again and again from the hospital to the 
front, again and again to the hungry submarines, he strode 
unflinching. And withal, as an individual, preserved 
through these torments the glories of a reasonable and 
compassionate mind.” It was with this equipment, spirit- 
ual as well as material, at a time when peace was lavishly 
bestowing the choicest rewards of human effort, that the 
nations that had most to lose plunged into the most ruinous 
and horrible conflict known to history. 
When we consider that the inability to maintain a just 
peace attests the failure of civilization itself, we may be less 
confident of the success of any artificial contrivances to 
prevent war. We must recognize that we are dealing with 
the very woof and warp of human nature. The war toend 
war has left its curse of hate, its lasting injuries, its breeding 
grounds of strife, and to secure an abiding peace appears to 
be more difficult than ever. There is no advantage in 
shutting our eyes to the facts; nor should we turn in dis- 
gust of panaceas to the counsel of despair. The pathway 
of peace is the longest and most beset with obstacles the 
human race has to tread; the goal may be distant, but we 
must press on.
-P-A-G-E-268
  262 THE PATHWAY OF PEACE 
It is not surprising that many should be captivated by the 
proposal, with its delusive simplicity and adequacy, for the 
outlawry of war. War should be made a crime, and those 
who instigate it should be punished as criminals. The 
suggestion, however futile in itself, has at least the merit 
of bringing us to the core of the problem. Even among its 
sponsors appear at once the qualifications which reflect 
the old distinction, so elaborately argued by Grotius, be- 
tween just and unjust wars. “The grounds of war,” said 
he, “are as numerous as those of judicial actions. For 
where the power of law ceases, there war begins.” He 
found the justifiable causes generally assigned for war to be 
three — defense, indemnity, and punishment. War is 
self-help, and the right to make war has been recognized 
as the corollary of independence, the permitted means by 
which injured nations protect their territory and maintain 
their rights. International law leaves aggrieved States 
who cannot obtain redress for their wrongs by peaceful 
means to exact it by force. If war is outlawed, other means 
of redress of injuries must be provided. Moreover, few, 
if any, intend to outlaw self-defense, a right still accorded 
to individuals under all systems of law. To meet this 
difficulty, the usual formula is limited to wars of aggression. 
But justification for war, as recently demonstrated, is 
ready at hand for those who desire to make war, and there 
is rarely a case of admitted aggression, or where on each 
side the cause is not believed to be just by the peoples who 
support the war. 
There is a further difficulty that lies deeper. There is 
no lawgiver for independent States. There is no legisla- 
ture to impose its will by majority vote, no executive to 
give effect even to accepted rules. The outlawry of war 
necessarily implies a self-imposed restraint, and free 
peoples, jealous of their national safety, of their freedom of 
opportunity, of the rights and privileges they deem essen-
-P-A-G-E-269
CHARLES EVANS HUGHES 268 
tial to their well being, will not forego the only sanction at 
their command in extreme exigencies. The restraints they 
may be willing to place upon themselves will always be 
subject to such conditions as will leave them able to afford 
self-protection by force, and in this freedom there is abun- 
dant room for strife sought to be justified by deep-seated 
convictions of national interests, by long-standing griev- 
ances, by the apprehension of aggression to be forestalled. 
The outlawry of war, by appropriate rule of law making 
war a crime, requires the common accord needed to estab- 
lish and maintain a rule of international law, the common 
consent to abandon war; and the suggested remedy thus 
implies a state of mind in which no cure is needed. As the 
restrain is self-imposed, it will prove to be of avail only 
while there is a will to peace. 
It is this difficulty which constantly suggests recourse to 
force to maintain peace. Peoples who would engage in 
war, it is said, must be compelled to be peaceful; there 
should be an international force adequate to prevent ag- 
gression and to redress wrongs. The analogy of domestic 
peace is pressed; the force of the State — that is, of all the 
people — maintains the authority of the municipal law and 
compels public order. The analogy has held good in the 
case of great empires and within the range of their imperial 
power. The earliest empires, established through conquest 
and the greed of dominion, doubtless diminished wars 
among the subject peoples while the imperial authority 
continued, and the centuries of the pax Romana were made 
possible by the unchallengeable sway of Rome. It is un- 
fortunately true that it is self-determination which makes 
for war and places obstacles in the way of all plans for 
keeping the peace. Thirty-five years ago the most dis- 
tinguished of publicists found some promise of peace in 
the alliance of the three emperors and in the consequent iso- 
lation and agreement for peaceful adjustment of a limited
-P-A-G-E-270
  264 THE PATHWAY OF PEACE 
group of questions which otherwise might lead to conflict. 
But time has shown how illusory are alliances of great 
powers so far as the maintenance of peace is concerned. 
In considering the use of international force to secure 
peace, we are again brought to the fundamental necessity 
of common accord. If the feasibility of such a force be 
conceded for the purpose of maintaining adjudications of 
legal right, this is only because such an adjudication would 
proceed upon principles commonly accepted, and thus 
forming part of international law, and upon the common 
agreement to respect the decision of an impartial tribunal 
in the application of such principles. This is a limited 
field where force is rarely needed and where the sanctions 
of public opinion and the demands of national honor are 
generally quite sufficient to bring about acquiescence in 
judicial awards. But in the field of conflicting national 
policies, and what are deemed to be essential interests, 
when the smoldering fires of old grievances have been 
fanned into a flame by a passionate sense of immediate 
injury, or the imagination of peoples is dominated by ap- 
prehension of present danger to national safety, or by what 
is believed to be an assault upon national honor, what force 
is to control the outbreak? Great powers agreeing among 
themselves may indeed hold small powers in check. But 
who will hold great powers in check when great powers 
disagree? The trust in force must in truth be trust in 
common agreement behind the force. And we are thus 
brought back to the sentiment of peoples, to the common 
accord which makes peace possible. The application of 
force when there is disagreement means war, not peace; and 
then the basis of confidence, if found at all, is merely in the 
disparity of arms. 
All contrivances for maintaining peace by economic 
pressure, as well as by military force, depend upon the sen- 
timent which will apply the pressure and direct the force
-P-A-G-E-271
  CHARLES EVANS HUGHES 265 
when the test comes. Such arrangements are likely to fail 
when they are most needed, because national interests are 
diverse and unanimity of action under stress of crises in- 
volving conflicts of opinion is well-nigh impossible. The 
independence and equality of States is the postulate of 
international relations. There is no path to peace except 
as the will of peoples may open it. The way to peace is 
through agreement, not through force. The question then 
is not of any ambitious general scheme to prevent war, but 
simply of the constant effort, which is the highest test of 
statesmanship in relation to every possible cause of strife, 
to diminish among peoples the disposition to resort to force, 
and to find a just and reasonable basis for accord. If the 
energy, ability, and sagacity equal to that now devoted to 
preparation for war could be concentrated upon such efforts 
aided by the urgent demands of intelligent public opinion, 
addressed not to impossibilities but to the removal or ad- 
justment of actual differences, we should make such ap- 
proach to our goal. 
Over against the arbitrament of war we put the reign of 
law. But the reign of law is limited by the content of the 
law and by the processes of its development. International 
law consists of those principles and rules of conduct which 
civilized States regard as obligatory upon them, and hence 
are generally observed in their relations with each other. 
They are deduced by reason and exemplified by practice, 
and, resting on general consent, can be modified or added 
to only by consent. Lord Mansfield described the law of 
nations as “founded upon justice, equity, convenience, the 
reason of the thing, and confirmed by long usage.” Lack- 
ing in definite sanction other than public opinion, it is in 
constant danger of being supplanted by considerations of 
expediency whenever the exigency is so severe, or the im- 
mediate advantages so great, or opinion so divided, as to 
warrant the risk. There was abundant illustration of this
-P-A-G-E-272
  266 THE PATHWAY OF PEACE 
in the recent war, which began in “repudiation of every 
element of fundamental right upon which the law of 
nations rests” and was prosecuted with but slight regard to 
any obligatory principle which was thought to stand in the 
way of success. If we are to live in a world of order and of 
peace the foundations of international law must be se- 
cured, its postulates must be reasserted, and there must be 
expert attention to its development in dealing with the un- 
settled questions of a legal nature which have arisen in 
international intercourse. 
It has been said that if the founders of international law 
did not create a sanction, they did create a law-abiding 
sentiment. This is in truth the most important sanction, 
and to-day there is need that this law-abiding sentiment 
should be re-created and that the tendency, increased by 
nine years of war and the confusion and unrest following 
war, to rely on force should be checked. It is not that the 
field of law is broad; it is necessarily a narrow one, limited, 
as has been said, to those principles and rules of general 
application which have found general acceptance. But 
the spirit which maintains the law within that field, which 
recognizes its restraints although self-imposed, which safe- 
guards the independence, the equality, and the proper 
jurisdiction and privileges of the members of the family of 
nations and assures the sanctity of international engage- 
ments — this upholding of correlative rights and obliga- 
tions — is of vital importance not simply with respect to 
these rights and obligations in themselves but in producing 
the will to peace. However narrow may be the field in 
which the principles of law obtain, there will be no peace in 
the world if the spirit of men permits these principles to be 
trampled upon as self-interest may prompt. 
It is, therefore, most desirable that all discussion of 
international relations should not revolve about questions 
of policy and expediency, however important these may be,
-P-A-G-E-273
  CHARLES EVANS HUGHES 267 
but that along with this necessary discussion there should 
be the determination to reéstablish the law, to quicken the 
sense of the obligation of States under the law. As soon as 
possible the codification of international law should be 
undertaken, not merely to give formal definiteness to 
accepted principles, but to heighten the respect for these 
postulates and rules by fresh discussion and restatement. 
And with this enterprise, attention should be given to the 
resolution of all the manifold uncertainties and diversities 
of opinion as to matters which properly belong within the 
domain of law, and to the provision of new rules needed to 
meet new situations. It would be difficult to conceive a 
process requiring more deliberation and patience. For at 
every step the general consent of nations must be had, and 
at every step, except in the simplest matters, the opposing 
policy and objections of some nation will be encountered. 
The difficulty must be met by conferences which have the 
sole object of promoting the codification and development 
of law. It must be met by the aroused and insistent pur- 
pose of the members of the bar, who by their unremitting 
and organized endeavor may produce among their peoples 
the profound conviction that there will be no continuing 
peace unless conscience and a dominant sense of justice 
demand and insure the supremacy of law. 
As legal principles and rules are supported by general 
acceptance, we may look with confidence for the general 
support of opinion in their application and vindication 
through impartial tribunals. The difficulty here is not the 
acceptance of the theory of judicial settlement, but in es- 
tablishing entire confidence in the impartiality of tribunals 
and their freedom from political influence. It must also be 
recognized that questions arise which, although requiring 
for their solution the application of principles of law or the 
interpretation of treaties, touch so closely the vital interests 
or the pride and honor of States that they are unwilling to 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  268 THE PATHWAY OF PEACE 
allow the settlement to pass into other hands. And beyond 
all questions of law there lie the most difficult situations, 
where there are no determined principles, where national 
policies and ambitions conflict, where nations seek expan- 
sion and opportunities of trade by spheres of political and 
economic influence among weaker peoples, where rivalries 
are embittered by mutual distrust and ever-present fear, 
where intrigue is the busy servant of the lust of power, 
where compelled adjustments have left deep wounds and a 
passionate desire for a redress of injuries inflicted by force 
and sought to be redressed by force. As against these 
causes of strife, creating the disposition to look for pre- 
texts for the use of force, efforts to maintain a permanent 
peace have thus far proved to be futile. Plans for com- 
missions of inquiry for periods of cooling off, for the use of 
good offices, are all important and may be efficacious to a 
gratifying extent. But these measures deal with cases 
already aggravated, and it may be well doubted whether in 
grave crises they would avail. Great powers, well armed) 
and having a vivid sense of opportunity, supported by 
popular clamor for the vindication of national interests, are 
disposed to seize what they believe to be within their grasp. 
Resistance by force means war. Fear of opposing force 
may stay the hand, but this does not mean peace — rather, 
renewed preparation and a waiting for the day. There is 
only one way to make peace secure and that is the difficult 
but necessary effort to translate particular controversies 
into voluntary reasonable agreements. To this purpose, of 
a definite, concrete sort, rather than to fanciful programs, 
the intelligence of peoples should be devoted... . 
I recur to the main point, that the only real progress to 
abiding peace is found in the friendly disposition of peoples 
and that facilities for maintaining peace are useful only to 
the extent that this friendly disposition exists and finds 
expression. The means of waging war in its most horrible
-P-A-G-E-275
  
CHARLES EVANS HUGHES 269 
form are now apparently within the reach of all and are 
more easily contrived and concealed than ever. War is 
not only possible, but probable, where mistrust and hatred 
and desire for revenge are the dominant motives. Our 
first duty is at home with our own opinion, by education 
and unceasing effort to bring to naught the mischievous 
exhortations of chauvinists; our next is to aid in every 
practicable way in promoting a better feeling among other 
peoples, the healing of wounds, and the just settlement of 
differences. 
Our own relations furnish the happiest illustration and 
strengthen our faith. It is not that we began in friendship 
or had the advantage of a tradition of brotherly love. Quite 
the contrary. Our 100 years and more of peace were pre- 
ceded by long periods of bitterness and of savage strife; 
the new world received as an unfortunate heritage the 
warring ambitions of the old. It is not that since the close 
of that era we have been without serious controversies. 
The peace of Ghent left us many questions of difficulty 
which apparently defied amicable settlement. But we 
now recall the serious disputes of the nineteenth century 
with mutual gratification at the conquests of peace and the 
arduous achievements of self-restraint. It is not that we 
have been lacking in national pride, in courage, or martial 
spirit. The long record of fortitude, of heroism, and mili- 
tary ardor and capacity in the Great War has no more in- 
spiring chapter than that written by the sons of Canada 
who with eager swiftness rushed to the support of the 
motherland in the struggle to maintain the very essentials 
of liberty, and to the final success of that struggle the 
Dominion pledged all her resources of material and spirit- 
ual power. It was the privilege of our own people in that 
war, convinced of the vital character of the issue, to take 
our place at your side, and the friendship which had grown 
out of the unlikely soil, sown with the seeds of early differ-
-P-A-G-E-276
  270 THE PATHWAY OF PEACE 
ences, came to glorious fruition in the common sacrifices 
on the fields of France. It is pleasant to recall that it was 
Alexander Hamilton, the apostle both of national strength 
and of international peace, who first suggested, in his re- 
commendation to President Washington in 1794, the limita- 
tion of armament on the Great Lakes, and our undefended 
line of thirty-five hundred miles is at once a memorial and a 
prophecy — a memorial of the past triumphs of reasonable- 
ness and a prophecy that all future problems will be solved 
without breach of amity. 
The reason for this happy condition points to the solu- 
tion the world needs. We have formed the habit of peace; 
we think in terms of peace. Differences arise, but our con- 
fidence in each other’s sense of justice and peaceful intent 
remains unshaken and dominates our purposes and plans. 
The only pathway of peace is that in which our peoples are 
walking together. In the depths of our grief at the loss of 
the great leader, whose every thought, whose constant en- 
deavor, were directed to the establishment of peace, it is a 
precious memory that almost his last words were spoken on 
the soil of your country testifying to our abiding friendship, 
our mutual interests, our common aims. Let these words 
of the late President ever remain as the expression and as- 
surance of abiding peace: “Our protection is in our frater- 
nity, our armor is our faith; the tie that binds more firmly 
year by year is ever-increasing acquaintance and comrade- 
ship through interchange of citizens; and the compact is 
not of perishable parchment, but of fair and honorable 
dealing which, God grant, shall continue for all time.”

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL MIND? 
NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER 
In 1912, at the Lake Mohonk Conference on International 
Arbitration, I offered a definition of the International 
Mind. To-day I propose to return to that subject and to 
make some observations from a philosophical point of view. 
One who accustoms himself to look beneath the surface 
of human history will find constantly at work there power- 
ful and conflicting emotions and ideas. The happenings 
that one takes note of day by day are the result of these 
hidden and sometimes unsuspected causes. From the 
vast reservoir of the world’s unconscious mental life, there 
flow those constant streams of tendency which produce the 
results that are visible to all men. Wars and migrations 
come and go, nations rise and fall, the center of gravity of 
human interest moves from one point to another far re- 
moved, and only those are mystified who seek the explana- 
tion solely on the surface of things. A deeper and more 
reflective examination of all that pertains to human life and 
conduct will often give the clue to an understanding of 
what is taking place. 
From the break-up of the Roman Empire to the present 
day, a period of perhaps fifteen centuries, the most power- 
ful moving force in the history of the Western World, al- 
though often unconsciously operating, has been the struggle 
for nationality, for national organization, for national in- 
dependence, and for national expansion. The integration 
of separate States into empires, and then the break-up of

  272 DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MIND 
these empires themselves, have been due to this cause. 
Religious zeal, economic pressure, and the thirst for novelty 
have been contributing causes — sometimes powerfully so 
— but the persistent struggle for nationality has domi- 
nated all these. 
During the eighteenth century the civilized world wit- 
nessed with sympathy and regret the suppression of the 
nationality of Poland, which had existed for a thousand 
years, and the forcible division of its territory among the 
governments of three peoples other than its own. During 
the nineteenth century the world witnessed with sympathy, 
and indeed with enthusiasm, the steady expansion of the 
British Empire and the movement for the political unity 
of the Italian and the German States. Here were believed 
to be three powerful elements in the development of civili- 
zation and of enlightenment, of advance in science, in 
letters, and in the arts, in the spread of commerce and of 
industry, and in the upholding of sound principles of per- 
sonal and national conduct to guide the life of men and 
nations. Partly for reasons that were psychological, partly 
for reasons that were economic, the movement toward 
nationality eventually became one of distinct menace to 
the people of the world and to the safety and independence 
of the smaller nations themselves. Finally, in 1914, the 
crash came, and the principle of nationality seemed for the 
moment to have exhausted its good elements and to have 
brought down the world in ruin about it. A huge combi- 
nation of nations was effected for the protection of those 
things which they held most dear, and at the conclusion of 
the military struggle an effort was made to bind the nations 
together in a league of common interest and common pur- 
pose. 
1t was held, on the one hand, that nationalism as a ruling 
force had distinctly failed, and that a broad and generous 
spirit of internationalism must henceforth take its place.
-P-A-G-E-279
  NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER 273 
On the other hand, it was asserted that any such hope was 
merely a dream, that it took no account of the actualities 
of human life and behavior, and that it lacked every ele- 
ment of practicality and helpful human service. This 
conflict of opinion, supported by a corresponding conflict 
of national and international policies, makes up the en- 
vironment in which we are living at the moment. Nation- 
alism has lost some part of its appeal to men, and faith in 
it as an end has been rudely shaken. Internationalism, 
on the other hand, certainly in its more extreme form, fails 
to commend itself to the judgment of many sagacious 
leaders of opinion, and its fate is hanging in the balance. 
If it be true that the struggle for nationalism, which has 
ruled the history of the Western World for so long, has 
exhausted itself as a moving force, then we are truly stand- 
ing at a cross-roads in the history of the world. If the road 
to nationalism be closed to farther progress, what road lies 
open to humanity? 
It would be difficult.to find any problem, either intellec- 
tual or practical, that presents itself more persistently or in 
more varied forms than that of the relation between the 
One and the Many. The ancient Greek philosophers saw 
its significance, and, with that naive directness so charac- 
teristic of them, attacked it as a fundamental question that 
must be answered if the world was to be grasped by human 
intelligence. The problem of the One and the Many lies at 
the bottom of all logic, of all ethics, of all economics, and of 
all politics; it lies at the bottom of the problem of national- 
ism and internationalism. How can the One be enriched 
and perfected not only without harm to the Many, but so 
as to enrich and perfect the Many itself? How can the One 
be distinguished from the Many and given a form and a 
personality all its own? How can the One so guide and 
direct its own appetites and so shape its own conduct as to 
build up rather than to tear down the advantage and the
-P-A-G-E-280
  274 DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MIND 
welfare of the Many? ‘Truly, the relation between the 
One and the Many, if the oldest of intellectual problems, 
is also one of the most many-sided and most difficult. 
It may be agreed that history and anthropology have 
demonstrated to us that nationality does not rest, certainly 
does not entirely rest, upon a basis of race. The history of 
Greece, of Rome, of Italy, of France, of Great Britain, and 
of the United States would appear to make that contention 
impossible. Doubtless in a true nation there is and must 
be a sufficient basis of ethnic unity, but that ethnic unity 
may itself, as in the case of Italy, of Great Britain, and now 
of the United States, be the sum total of quite different 
elements. There must, in addition, be a sufficient measure 
of geographic unity; otherwise economic interests alone 
will be sufficient to cause constant conflict and desire for 
expansion, even by violence, into the territory of a neigh- 
bor. Then, to accompany this sufficient basis of ethnic 
unity and of geographic unity, there must be a governmen- 
tal unity. The nation must organize itself as a State, and 
give expression thereby to its political consciousness, its 
political traditions, and its political ideals. Obviously, if 
each true nation is to follow this course, and if there be no 
ruling purpose but selfish aggrandizement — economic, 
territorial, or numerical — the several nations must be in 
constant conflict, and constant international war must 
follow as a necessary result. 
It may assist to propose a satisfactory answer to these 
difficult and perplexing questions if we look upon a nation 
as endowed with personality like an individual. In that 
case we gain some new comprehension of what is meant by 
national opinion other than the opinions of individuals, 
of what is meant by national feeling other than the feeling 
of individuals, and of what is meant by national ambition 
and purpose other than the ambition and purpose of in- 
dividuals. Nothing is more certain than that there is a
-P-A-G-E-281
  
NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER 275 
psychology of the crowd, and that, difficult as it may be to 
understand, a mass of men thinking, feeling, and acting 
under a common impulse think, feel, and act in ways that as 
separate individuals they could not hope to imitate. Ifa 
nation be a person — and I think it is — then those tested 
principles of ethics which have application to the conduct 
of individual persons would also have application to the 
conduct of national persons. The same fundamental pre- 
cepts, the same ruling points of view, that we call moral in 
the case of an individual are also moral in the case of a 
nation. This thesis finds powerful support in the teach- 
ings of Chancellor Kent, who in his Commentaries on 
American Law wrote these words: 
States, or bodies politic, are to be considered as moral persons, 
having a public will, capable and free to do right and wrong, inas- 
much as they are collections of individuals, each of whom carries 
with him into the service of the community the same binding law 
of morality and religion which ought to control his conduct in 
private life. 
There is no proper conflict between this doctrine and the 
theory of sovereignty. If a sovereign be defined as an 
individual or a group without a political superior, then we 
have only to have recourse to the principles of ethics to 
proclaim the fact that self-direction, self-control, self- 
discipline, must be operative in the case of a national per- 
son as they are in the case of an individual person, if that 
national person is to appear to itself and to others as truly 
moral. In other words, the path to an exalted and purified 
nationalism and the path to a reasonable and practical 
internationalism would appear to converge. Just as it is 
not by the suppression but by the development of the capac- 
ity and resources of its individual members that the State 
itself is strengthened and enriched, so it is not by the 
limitation of the operation of the principle of nationality, but 
rather by its development on a higher plane, that the spirit
-P-A-G-E-282
  276 DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MIND 
of international codperation and service will be increased 
and uplifted. The world has no need for weak, struggling, 
uncertain nations, but it offers place, power, and oppor- 
tunity to strong, confident, and well-organized nations, that 
rule their conduct by moral principles and make no claim 
to override the world for their own selfish pride or aggran- 
dizement. If the alternative be Die Weltmacht oder Unter- 
gang, the end is certain to be Untergang. 
So soon as nations, both great and small, accept the 
doctrine that they are moral persons, and as such are bound 
to conform their conduct to moral laws, the basis is laid 
for the recognition of the like personality of other nations, 
and a true society of nations begins to appear. Just as 
individuals are no longer granted either moral excellence or 
political rights by reason of their intellectual competence 
or their material possessions, so nations, when judged as 
moral persons, are not to be given weight as large or small, 
rich or poor. One test of membership in a true society of 
nations must be like the test of membership in a society of 
individuals, namely willingness and capacity to observe 
loyally the principles and to follow earnestly the ideals 
which are characteristic of civilized States. A truly civil- 
ized nation, one which guides its practical policies by a 
moral purpose, will shape its own municipal laws with due 
regard to the laws and the customs of other nations when- 
ever they are brought into contact through commerce or the 
movement of their citizens. Not a few policies which ap- 
pear to be solely domestic have direct or indirect inter- 
national application or reference. 
The analogy between the individual and the nation may 
now, however, be pressed too far, since there is a tive 
psychology of the crowd or mass, which is very different 
from the psychology of the individual man. The studies 
in this field, which have been carried on for a quarter cen- 
tury past, have opened new vistas of knowledge and under-

standing to those who would grasp the significance of 
nations and who would try to explain their groupings and 
their conflicts. The economic motive, while by no means al- 
ways dominant, is everywhere important and occasionally 
controlling. History cannot be explained either solely by 
the economic motive or entirely without it. The psychol- 
ogy of the crowd, or mass, takes full account of this in- 
fluence in human affairs, but assigns it a properly subor- 
dinate place in the intellectual, emotional, and moral life 
of nations. 
A real difficulty is found, in the life of nations as in the 
life of individuals, in the ambition of the strong and power- 
ful to grow yet stronger and more powerful, even if it be at 
the expense of a weaker and less fortunate, though equally 
civilized, neighbor. The smaller nation, like the weaker or 
poorer individual, cannot find protection in force. Law, 
and law alone, can give it the security it desires. Opinion, 
which, as Napoleon once said, controls everything, crystal- 
lizes into the forms of law and speaks through those forms 
for the guidance and regulation of those who submit them- 
selves to the rule of law. Those who do not so submit 
themselves, be they individuals or nations, are the world’s 
criminals, and the criminal we have always with us, and 
shall have while human nature remains human. 
The best is often the enemy of the good. To insist upon 
perfection of organization often means to oppose the only 
present steps that are practicable toward the improvement 
of relations between men and nations. Such progress as 
has already been made is slow indeed when measured by 
the vision of prophets and the insight of philosophers. But 
yet it is considerable. It must be admitted, however, that 
to urge the rule of law over nations and to insist upon it is 
quite hopeless unless the road to law be paved by in- 
structed and enlightened public opinion. An international 
engagement or treaty may be admirable in form and correct 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  278 DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MIND 
in every legal detail, and yet, under the pressure of national 
ambition, of national pride, or of national fear, it may be- 
come a scrap of paper, simply because there is not behind it 
that firm body of public opinion upon which alone enduring 
law can rest and by which alone obedience can be secured. 
Here again we come upon another phase of the problem 
of the One and the Many. If a nation, representative of 
the One, is so reckless of moral control as to seek only its 
selfish aggrandizement at whatever cost to the Many, it 
becomes and must become the enemy of the world’s peace 
and order, precisely as an individual acting in similar 
fashion becomes the enemy of the peace and order of the 
community in which he lives. It is essential that the gos- 
pel of service should be hearkened to by nations as well as 
by individuals. It is the teaching of this gospel, that a 
nation exists not for self-aggrandizement, but for the pro- 
motion of the general good, and that it may grow great and 
strong and rich without danger to mankind, if its greatness, 
its strength, its wealth, and its riches be used in a spirit of 
friendship, not hostility, of service, not selfishness. To 
put it differently, it is essential that the civilized nations 
should develop, each for itself, what I ventured long since 
to describe as the International Mind. 
The International Mind is that fixed habit of thought 
and action which looks upon the several nations of the 
civilized world as codperating equals in promoting the 
progress of civilization, in developing commerce and in- 
dustry, and in diffusing science and education throughout 
the world. 
The International Mind, so defined, is in sharp antago- 
nism to that internationalism which would break down the 
boundaries of nations and merge all mankind, regardless of 
differences in tradition, in law, in language, in religion, and 
in government, into a single and common unit. Such 
internationalism, instead of being progressive, would be 
   
-P-A-G-E-285
  NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER 279 
reactionary. It would obliterate those differences which 
the march of progress has developed, and it would seek to 
destroy those landmarks of civilization which have been 
set up at great cost of life and labor over twenty centuries. 
Such internationalism would foment discord by creating 
false relationships, which, having no body of facts to corre- 
spond to them, could only give rise to friction, to conflict, 
and to internal war. 
The International Mind, on the other hand, makes much 
of the spirit, the temper, and the tradition of nationality. 
It builds upon history and upon achievement, and it ap- 
peals to the pride, the glory, and the spirit of service of the 
nations, both great and small. It sees in the various civil- 
ized nations so many different facets of a single crystal, 
each reflecting the light of civilization in its own way, and 
each being a necessary part of the complete and perfect 
stone. 
It is quite idle to say that an association of nations based 
upon the International Mind is a limitation on a nation’s 
sovereignty, or that it calls into existence a supergovern- 
ment. Just the contrary is true. What higher use can be 
made of a nation’s sovereignty than to codperate with 
other like-minded sovereign nations in the common task 
of advancing civilization and promoting the comforts, the 
satisfactions, and the happiness of man, in removing arti- 
ficial barriers to trade and commerce, in spreading abroad 
the teachings of science, in making common property of 
the world’s literature and the world’s art, and in holding 
out the hand of helpfulness and courage to those less for- 
tunate peoples who, backward in their social organization 
or in their philosophy of life, have not yet been able to take 
their place at the council board of nations? In that repub- 
lican form of government, which is rapidly becoming the 
most usual form of political organization, no man has the 
privilege of ruling any other man, but merely that of shar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    280 DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MIND 
ing with him the joint control over their common interests. 
So it would be with an association of internationally minded 
nations. No supergovernment would be called into exist- 
ence to rule any nation, but there would be a codperative 
effort to seek out, to advance, and to improve those matters 
of common concern which, for good or ill, affect every na- 
tion alike. 
It is the old, old story. It is the problem of the One and 
the Many in a new and acute form. That which Pytha- 
goras, and Parmenides, and Plato discussed in the simple 
language of early Greek philosophy, we are called upon to 
deal with under the complicated conditions of modern 
social, economic, and political life. Just as in the philoso- 
phy of the Greeks the One could not be got rid of, so in the 
political philosophy of this twentieth century the individual 
nation cannot and must not have its sovereignty invaded 
or suppressed. Just as in the philosophy of the Greeks the 
One and the Many had to be explained, if at all, with refer- 
ence to each other, so in our modern political philosophy 
the individual nation and an association of nations must be 
looked upon, not as antagonistic but as complementary, as 
parts of one complete organic whole. The method of 
achieving this end is the method of law. The pathway to 
that law is provided by morals. The support both of 
morals and of law is to be found in public opinion. That 
public opinion must be taught to know the International 
Mind, to accept it, and to guide national action and policy 
in accordance with it.

THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS? 
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 
Presipent Harprine’s signature on May 19, 1921, of the 
three-per-cent immigration bill had a significance which 
possibly the President himself, and certainly the majority 
of his fellow countrymen, did not fully grasp. Although a 
temporary measure, passed partly in response to a post- 
war emergency, the new law, which restricts the annual 
immigration of persons of any nationality to three per cent 
of the number of that nationality resident in the United 
States in 1910, marks the inauguration of a new stage in 
human evolution. It is one of the first expressions of an 
era in which mass movements of population from nation to 
nation will not be permitted. 
When Herbert Spencer in one of his inspired passages 
asserted that “to be a good animal is the first requisite to 
success in life, and to be a nation of good animals is the 
first condition of national prosperity,” he was warning us 
against the common danger of being so impressed by the 
distinctly human achievements of our species that we ig- 
nore our fundamental animal limitations — particularly in 
our social relationships — or imagine that they can be elim- 
inated. 
One of the outstanding features of all animal life is its 
immediate dependence on the land, in the broad sense. 
Every animal draws its sustenance directly or indirectly 
from the land, and each species of animals has a range of 
life and activity limited to those areas which afford its 
appropriate sustenance, and perishes when removed. Since 
the food supplies which Nature furnishes are strictly lim- 
1 From the Yale Review, July, 1922. By special permission.  
-P-A-G-E-290
  284 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
ited, it follows that the number of any species which can 
exist at any time is fixed definitely by the amount of ap- 
propriate food within its range at that time. Still further, 
as there have been no additions to the elemental qualities 
of the land since the foundation of the earth, it comes about 
that every species soon reaches its maximum, and from 
that time on remains stationary. Barring great natural 
changes which alter the terms of existence, or the inter- 
ference of man, the “population” of every old species re- 
mains fixed from generation to generation — the death 
rate exactly equalling the birth rate. 
To meet these rigorous terms of survival the animals in- 
capable of giving protection or real nurture to their off- 
spring depend upon an almost incredible fecundity, amount- 
ing in some cases to many millions from each female 
annually, and leave the rest to chance. In such cases the 
“infant mortality” falls short of one hundred per cent by 
an infinitesimal fraction, only one out of millions ever 
being able to survive. Such are the methods of “benefi- 
cent Nature.” 
As we ascend in the scale of animal evolution we find 
that the developing instincts and intelligence of each suc- 
cessive species eventually make possible a period of real 
infancy, with genuine protection and nurture, and this 
in turn permits a corresponding reduction in the birth rate. 
This progression is one of the best tests of real evolutionary 
advancement. 
The human species began its career with a range of 
existence, a rate of reproduction, and a period of infant 
care very similar to those of the ancestral ape-like group 
from-which it sprang. But like every new species, it made 
slightly different demands upon its habitat, and had a 
. slightly different equipment for gratifying those demands, 
from even its nearest kindred, which for a time permitted 
it to increase, until at last its numbers threatened to exceed
-P-A-G-E-291
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 285 
the supporting power of its original range. It was then 
faced with the alternative of submitting to a fixed limit to 
its number, or else of extending its territory. Any species 
so situated would naturally adopt the latter alternative, 
if possible. 
In seizing the possibility of increasing its numbers by 
extending its range, the human species entered upon that 
great series of population movements which was eventually 
to establish it in every nook and cranny of the earth’s sur- 
face which by any stretch of ingenuity could be made to 
support human life. Each new outpost, finding itself in a 
new environment, gradually worked out a new physical 
type suited to that environment — or, to speak more ac- 
curately, progressively worked out a new type while in 
process of moving from one environment to another — and 
at the same time evolved new arts of life, beliefs, customs, 
and social habits. Thus by a process of migration, adap- 
tation, isolation, and segregation were developed the great 
primary races of man, and the great original cultures. 
_the outstanding and characteristic feature of this first 
-. phase of migration was that it was a movement into 
tetritory unoccupied by man. The little bands of strag- 
glers, pushed out from their ancestral range by the pressure 
of increasing population, did not encroach upon the terri- 
tory of others of their kind. They met with no human 
opposition; and, because it was a peaceful aggression upon 
unoccupied land, the first great epoch of migration bene- 
fited everybody concerned. 
This primary phase of the movement in search of land 
lasted innumerable thousands of years, but eventually it 
came to an end, earlier in the older regions of human settle- 
ment, later in the remote, inaccessible, and unattractive 
areas of the globe. In time practically every available 
crevice of the earth’s surface had its aboriginal human 
group, and there were no more uninhabited regions into  
-P-A-G-E-292
    286 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
which to shove the excess populations. But the hunger for 
land did not in the least abate when this point was reached. 
In fact, it became if anything more acute. For by this 
time man had achieved a certain degree of civilization, 
with a variety of material needs and wants, which could be 
satisfied only from the land. Thus each group, finding the 
demands for wealth of its augmenting members increasing 
beyond the power of gratification from its own possessions, 
was impelled to seek more land wherever it might be se- 
cured, or what was virtually equivalent, to appropriate the 
products of other land. But under the conditions then 
prevailing the only way to get more territory was to take it 
from some other human group. Such an enterprise was 
naturally resented and opposed by the group threatened; 
and armed force became an essential of land acquisition. 
Such, in outline, was the origin of the second great phase 
in population movements, which covers almost the whole 
period of the recorded history of the human race. Its 
dominating characteristic is the use of military force in the 
land quest. Its spectacular events are the great wars over 
land which blot the pages of history. Its activities are 
group activities; the conditions for the seeking of land by 
individuals did not exist. Consequently, its prerequisite 
is group sympathy, group consciousness, and group soli- 
darity, for which the best single word isnationality. Nation- 
ality, as has been observed, was one of the products of the 
preceding era of population movements. 
With the discovery of the American continents a new 
factor was introduced into the land problem of the ag- 
gressive nations, that is, the nations of Western Europe. 
A seemingly unlimited and extraordinarily fertile area was 
brought within their ken, inhabited by natives of so low a 
degree of civilization that their resistance could be easily 
overcome, in fact would be little more than one of the inci- 
dents in conquering the wilderness. The tremendous sig-
-P-A-G-E-293
  
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 287 
nificance of this event, and the other great discoveries that 
went with it, has been recognized by every historian or 
sociologist interested in anthropology or geography. In 
an entirely accurate sense it offered a brand-new chance to 
the human species. The land quest immediately took on a 
different aspect. The old, civilized, and crowded nations 
of the world gained relief for a time from the intensity of 
their contest over the regions previously known, and turned 
their rivalry into a struggle for the acquisition of the new 
territories. These were so enormous in extent that the an- 
tagonisms on this side of the Atlantic became very much 
diluted. In time the territory was divided among the off- 
shoots of various European nations, and these offshoots, 
for the most part, became independent, or virtually in- 
dependent, nations. It is the attitude of these new nations 
towards migration that has created the third phase of 
population movements, which has continued for about a 
century and a half, and is now drawing to a close. 
The statement in an earlier paragraph that when the 
human species increases up to the limit of subsistence on 
its original range, it faces the possibility of being forced 
into a stationary population is probably not strictly true. 
One of the chief things that distinguish men from all other 
species of animals is his power to manipulate the forces of 
Nature to suit his own ends. It may be, accordingly, that 
at no time was man ever faced with an absolutely fixed 
limit to increase, though for tens of thousands of years the 
maximum rate of increase, possible in an occupied region 
must have been exceedingly small. Each improvement, 
however, in the arts of life, in material civilization, has 
made possible the support of a larger number of people on a 
given area. Consequently, the increase of the species up 
to the present time has rested on two grounds: the appro- 
priation of new land, and the more efficient utilization of 
the tracts already occupied. Human history is the record 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  288 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
of a race between the tendency of the species to multiply 
and its ability to increase the supporting power of the land 
by invention, energy, industry, and thrift. 
Up to 1492, on the whole, the arts of life had managed to 
keep far enough ahead to allow a slow increase, but never 
far enough ahead to prevent a constant and drastic re- 
straint upon the natural impulse to multiply. Then, al- 
most at a stroke, the balance was shifted. By the discov- 
ery of America, Australia, and South Africa the peoples 
of Europe, sufficiently skilled in the arts of civilization to 
be able to maintain relatively dense populations with a 
high degree of comfort, were presented with vast areas in- 
habited by peoples so low in the scale of culture as to be 
able to support only a very sparse population. It has been 
estimated by a competent authority that the total number 
of Indians north of Mexico at the time of the coming of the 
white men was not much over half a million. 
The two chief differentiating features of the modern era 
are that movements of population have been peaceful 
movements into occupied land, and that they have been 
individualized. The reasons are not far to seek. Modern 
immigration has been peaceful because the receiving coun- 
tries were glad to admit the immigrant, or at worst were 
indifferent to his coming, for the simple reason that his 
coming constituted a benefit, or at least was not a menace. 
Thus in America, from the time of the earliest settle- 
ments, there was a strong sentiment for increase of popu- 
lation, not only by natural reproduction but by accessions 
from abroad. This refers, obviously, to the European 
settlers themselves — the Indians naturally felt differently, 
and there was a transitional period during which they had 
to be disposed of. Its activities, of course, corresponded 
to the type of the preceding period in so far as actual force 
was required. But this time quickly passed, and there 
emerged, on both the American continents, in Australia,
-P-A-G-E-295
  
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 289 
and eventually in South Africa, independent or virtually 
independent states, which had sufficient self-consciousness 
to frame their own policies and laws about migration, and 
sufficient standing among the nations to enforce those 
policies. 
The startling thing about the migration policies of these 
new countries is that at the beginning they were all based 
on a warm welcome to all well-intentioned persons who 
wished to come. Such a thing had never been known 
before. The one requirement was that the immigrants 
should come as individuals, on their own initiative, not as 
the outposts of any foreign state with official backing. 
The essence of the Monroe Doctrine is the general state- 
ment that colonization — that is, settlement by authority 
— would henceforth not be tolerated in the Western Hemi- 
sphere. Hence modern migration is a movement of in- 
dividuals. 
For reasons which need not be detailed, the United 
States has always stood in the van, and in the limelight, 
in the matter of immigration affairs. She has attracted 
many times more immigrants than any other country, she 
has experienced more profound social effects from immi- 
gration than any other country, and she has led the way in 
the control of immigration. With a rather remarkable 
exactness Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia are 
following the same path in immigration, socially, economi- 
cally, and legislatively, as the United States, a generation 
or two in the rear. 
The question of immediate moment is whether this 
modern era of permitted, peaceful, individualized aggres- 
sion upon the land of new countries situated in the tem- 
perate zones is likely to be prolonged into the remote fu- 
ture, or whether through the action of unescapable forces 
it is nearing its close. The indications are that it is in fact 
already closing. There are no more new lands to be dis-
-P-A-G-E-296
  290 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
covered by civilized peoples. No new nations will ever 
again find homes in the wilderness in temperate zones. 
Thus it is incontestable that the present era will not be pro- 
longed by a repetition of the occurrences which gave it 
birth. If it is to be prolonged at all it must be because the 
factors upon which its distinctive characteristics rest be- 
come relatively permanent —in other words, that the 
more favorably situated nations of the world will find it 
advisable to continue to permit peaceable, individualized 
migration. Is this probable? 
The answer is to be found in the present social conditions 
in the immigrant-receiving countries. These countries 
have in the past welcomed foreign accessions because they 
needed them in their business, literally. Their populations 
have not been large enough to enable them immediately to 
achieve their maximum standard of living, and they have 
not been willing to wait for the slower processes of natural 
reproduction. The tradition of welcome has therefore 
rested upon facts. As soon as the facts alter, the basis of 
tradition will be removed, and in time the tradition itself 
will fall. Just as fast as the governing elements of nations 
become convinced that immigrants are no longer an ad- 
vantage, but rather a menace, policies will change. 
In the United States the tradition of the open door and 
the haven of refuge has been very strong. It took a full 
century of independent life to bring this nation to the point 
where it was ready to establish any requirements even as 
to the physical and moral fitness of the foreigners who were 
to be admitted. The first steps in this direction were mild 
and hesitating, barring out only such manifestly undesir- 
able elements as paupers, criminals, prostitutes, and per- 
sons suffering from contagious diseases. All subsequent 
legislation until five years ago was along the same line, 
building up a system of selective tests designed to secure a 
good quality of immigrants. There was no attempt in any 
law to limit the number of aliens admitted.
-P-A-G-E-297
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 291 
But we have at last come to the parting of the ways. 
The thinking people of the country have largely become con- 
vinced that in the future unrestricted immigration will be 
increasingly prejudicial to the best interests of the country. 
They are accordingly demanding its termination. The 
sentiment of Congress has been definitely restrictive for the 
past quarter of a century, particularly since the unequivo- 
cal conclusion arrived at by the authoritative Immigration 
Commission. The first legislative evidence of the new 
situation was the passage of the much-debated literacy 
test in 1917, which, while following precedent in its selec- 
tive form, is, nevertheless, definitely restrictive in effect, 
and was supported primarily for that reason by many 
of its most influential backers. The present temporary 
percentage restriction bill is the first directly restrictive 
measure which has ever been written upon our statute 
books. (The Chinese Exclusion Acts, it may be said in 
passing, are the theory selective, not restrictive, in that 
they are concerned with a kind of immigrant, not with num- 
bers.) This bill is the first paragraph in a new chapter of 
immigration regulation, and herein lies its extraordinary 
significance. 
There remains just one serious obstacle to be mastered, 
when once the thinking public of a nation becomes con- 
vinced that immigration is no longer consistent with na- 
tional prosperity — the ethics of the case, the question of 
rights. This is a more serious obstacle than it might at 
first seem. It presents two faces — the right to emigrate, 
which includes the right to demand admission, and the 
right to restrict or exclude. 
The tradition of emigration as a relief from pressure is of 
enormous weight. For so many tens of thousands of years 
movement has been the accepted means of escape from 
starvation or destitution that the idea of migration has 
become thoroughly ingrained in human nature. In the 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  292 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
beginning the impulse was instinctive, and it is semi- 
instinctive still. There are certain elements in foreign 
countries that deny the right of the United States to close 
its doors, and there are some within our own borders that 
are inclined to concede the position. Other people, while 
they do not go so far as to grant the right of outsiders to 
demand admission, nevertheless question the moral justi- 
fication of our denying admission. 
It must ever be borne in mind that the chief universal 
reason why foreign peoples wish to emigrate to the United 
States (which for purposes of brevity may be taken as the 
type of all immigrant-receiving countries) is that our land 
situation is superior to theirs. Whether it be the ambition 
of an individual, or the policy of a state, the demand for 
the admission of foreign nationals is based upon the desire 
that they and their country may get their share of our ad- 
vantages. And the essence of our advantage is that we are 
less crowded in proportion to our natural resources and 
degree of civilization than are they. They wish to be al- 
lowed to continue their peaceful aggression upon our land. 
The basic reason for the desire to emigrate is — as it al- 
ways has been — enlarged and enlarging population. 
Now, the fundamental source of an enlarging population 
is the birth rate. The larger the birth rate, other things 
being equal, the stronger the motive to emigrate. But in 
every old country where there exists a high birth rate there 
exists also a high death rate, with all the misery and degra- 
dation which always attend that combination. This mis- 
ery is the immediate source of the impulse to migrate. 
The countries whose nationals desire admission to our ad- 
vantages are those with a standard of living lower than ours 
by varying degrees, and the greater the gulf between our 
standard and theirs, the more insistent is the craving for 
admission. 
At first glance there seems to be excellent ground for those
-P-A-G-E-299
  
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 293 
who take the position that it is wrong for us to refuse to 
share our good things with unfortunate individuals of other 
lands. But when one fully grasps the magnitude of the 
forces involved, the problem takes on a different aspect. 
Increasing population is not confined to a few nations — it 
is a world phenomenon. The increase during the nine- 
teenth century was unprecedented. A careful estimate 
places the total population of the world in 1800 at about 
640,000,000 to 700,000,000. In 1914 it was 1,649,000,000. 
In 114 years a much greater increase in population had 
been produced than in all the preceding tens of thousands 
of years. The question naturally arises, if this could hap- 
pen in the nineteenth century, why not in the twentieth, 
and in the next, and the next? Why worry about over- 
population at all? 
There is something in our mentality that makes us re- 
luctant to admit great finalities in human affairs. It is 
hard for us to realize that what has happened in the past 
need not necessarily happen again, and that some things 
in human evolution are finished once and for all. There is 
no more pernicious proverb than that history repeats itself. 
That is the one thing that history never does. 
A little figuring will convince any questioner that in this 
particular, at least, history will not repeat itself. During 
the years 1906 to 1911 the population of the world in- 
creased at the rate of doubling every 60.1 years. If this 
rate were to continue, at the end of 10,000 years the popu- 
lation of the world would be 22,184 with 46 noughts follow- 
ing. This would mean in terms of standing room, allowing 
one and a half square feet per person, that the population 
would be 60,570 with 30 noughts following greater than 
the available standing room on the earth’s surface. The 
United States cannot undertake to care for such an in- 
crease of population as that for even a few decades, and 
there is no possibility that any other method of providing
-P-A-G-E-300
  294 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
for it can be devised. The phenomenal increase of popu- 
lation during the nineteenth century is accounted for 
directly by the great discoveries and the industrial and 
commercial revolutions which followed them, and “it 
never can happen again.” 
We think of our country as relatively thinly populated, 
and of China as an extreme example of overpopulation. 
“Teeming millions” is the stereotyped phrase with which 
we describe her people. Yet if the population of the United 
States (not including Alaska and Hawaii) should continue 
to increase at the rate which prevailed during the repre- 
sentative period from 1906 to 1911, before the end of this 
century — which some of our children will live to see — we 
should have a population about one third larger, on a land 
area about one fourth smaller, than that of China. By 
the end of the next century we should have a population 
much larger than the entire human species to-day. It 
therefore behooves us to recognize and face our own pro- 
blems in this field before undertaking to solve those of 
foreign nations. 
The simple fact is that the population problem of the 
world is so vast that no nation, or group of nations, how- 
ever idealistic, altruistic, and prosperous should attempt 
to solve it by means of migration, and no case can be made 
out for the obligation to do so. Particular weight is added 
to this assertion by two general laws of social science. The 
first of these laws is that no emigration stream of a sort 
which could conceivably be realized has any effect in re- 
ducing the population of an old and thickly settled coun- 
try, but may in fact tend to increase it. We could draw 
off a million Chinese a year for fifty years, and at the end 
of the period China would have just as large a population 
as if not a soul had emigrated. This seeming paradox is 
one of the best established truths of sociology, observed by 
Sir Walter Raleigh in England and Giovanni Botero in
-P-A-G-E-301
  
HENRY PRATT FAIRCHILD 295 
Italy, and attested by a long list of scientists from their 
day to the present. The attempt to correct overpopula- 
tion by emigration under modern conditions is like trying 
to lower the level of the sea by pouring the water by pail- 
fuls on to the sand of the shore. The second law is that 
whenever a competition of standards of living is set up, as 
it is by immigration, the invariable tendency is for the 
lower standard to win out. There is a sort of Gresham’s 
law at work in social affairs just as truly as in monetary 
affairs. The fate of any country which tries to solve the 
population problems of foreign countries by permitting 
immigration will be to see its own standard of living re- 
duced approximately to the level of that country from which 
the most destitute immigrants come, without producing 
any appreciable betterment in the foreign countries them- 
selves. 
The control of population will certainly be one of the 
greatest questions of the next few generations. It is pos- 
sible that man may always be able to escape the natural 
law of a stationary population, and by his arts maintain 
for an indefinite future slowly increasing numbers. But 
it is certain that he cannot long continue to increase at the 
present rate; and, if he is not to suffer a decline in civili- 
zation, he must see to it that the rate of increase is always 
kept definitely behind the advance in the arts of life. 
Some drastic check must come very soon, and the vital 
problem is what the nature of that check is to be. 
Every advance in hygiene, sanitation, and public health 
which tends to extend the average span of life adds to the 
gravity of this problem. Lothrop Stoddard has pointed 
out how the improvements in these fields introduced by 
white men into the lands of the colored races have already 
occasioned an unprecedented rate of increase among those 
peoples. No one can predict what the solution will be. 
But one thing is certain — the time has passed when any
-P-A-G-E-302
  296 THE END OF RACE MIGRATIONS 
form of land aggression, hostile or peaceful, can be recog- 
nized as a part of that solution. It is intolerable that a 
nation which is working out a scientific, humane system of 
population control should have its efforts thwarted by an 
uncontrolled torrent of outsiders. 
The book of race migrations must be closed forever. It 
is for an informed and sensible public opinion to put a stop 
to permitted invasions. The peace of the world cannot be 
assured until some effective check is placed upon war for 
land or the products of land; the prosperity of the world 
cannot be assured until there is a general denial of the right 
of any nation with an excessive increase of population to 
seek relief by sending its surplus nationals abroad. We 
have lately heard a good deal about the right of self- 
determination of peoples. It is time to assert the duty of 
self-determination. Each nation must be compelled to 
work out its own population problems without threatening 
the well-being of other nations that are more intelligent or 
more self-controlled. 
If the objection be raised that such a step should be post- 
poned until a more nearly equal division of advantages 
has been established among the nations of the world, the 
answer is furnished by Secretary Hughes’s attitude on dis- 
armament. Every world-wide reform must start at some 
time, and the best time is now. This is particularly true 
in population questions. Moreover, for the United States, 
the suggested equalization would inevitably mean a level- 
ing downwards. The more the nations of thé West are 
brought to the present situation of such countries as 
China and India, the gloomier becomes the outlook for the 
future, and the less possible becomes any satisfactory and 
permanent solution.

THE FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE 
WAYS? 
CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 
Tue family is a unit in the present social order and organ- 
ism. It is a historical unit. Marriage is its foundation. 
Whether marriage began in the capture or the purchase of 
women as wives, according to current theories, or whether 
the family was at first polygamous or polyandrous, accord- 
ing to other beliefs, it is clear that it was only through a 
long and hard struggle that the monogamous family was 
achieved. 
The family is also a natural unit. It seems to be the 
best method yet discovered for the continuation of the 
race. It is the nurse, and stands for the nurture of little 
children, with whom each generation begins, and who, 
having become mature, transmit human life to the genera- 
tion following. 
It is a social unit. The individual family is one with 
other families, also units to which it holds relations. It is 
further a legal unit. In formal ways, as well as informal, 
the law, either customary or statute, constitutes the fam- 
ily. It is also, at least to a degree, an ecclesiastical unit. 
For it touches relations apparently nothing less than in- 
finite in time and space. It is indeed a national unit. For 
the conditions, forms, methods, forces, for its creation and 
perpetuation, are different among different peoples. It is 
more, and lastly, a unit variable in time, by which I mean 
that its persons, potencies and perils differ in the different 
generations of men.

298 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
Comprehensively, the family unit stands midway be- 
tween the narrowest social unit, the individual, and the 
largest, the State. It is connected with the individual, for 
individuals compose it. It is connected with the State, 
for the State is composed of families. 
The adjustment of the family to the present social order 
is the problem which I have set myself to consider in the 
present article. Of this adjustment, I shall consider four 
aspects: (a) perils, more or less permanent, of the last sev- 
enty or a hundred years; (b) the perils of the two decades 
of the twentieth century; (c) the new means of protection 
of the family which society offers; (d) what ought to be 
done for the restoration of the family to its worthy place. 
I use the word “restoration,” for the family has fallen 
from its former condition. Divorce represents, in legal and 
social meaning, the first great peril and the immediate and 
comprehensive cause of family disintegration. But it is 
also a conglomerate of several causes, each contributing to 
the whole disruptive movement and effect. 
Of these more permanent causes, the first which I would 
name is the growth of individualism. Individualism was 
one of the direct products of the Protestant Reformation. 
The central principles of the Reformation were the princi- 
ples of human liberty and human responsibility; the right 
of every man to judge of truth and duty for himself, and 
to render his account to God alone. That the right of 
individual liberty is at the present time in danger of being 
pressed so far that the counterbalancing truth of individual 
responsibility ceases to act, every student of social pro- 
blems admits. | 
It is in the marriage relation that this tendency is now 
most clearly indicated. 
The belief is prevalent, and seems to be growing, that 
marriage is a civil contract and a civil contract only. Like 
other contracts, it is entered into for the pleasure and con-
-P-A-G-E-305
  CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 299 
venience of the parties, and, like other contracts, may be 
terminated when pleasure and convenience are no longer 
served. We are fast reaching a point where the state of 
matrimony will exist only in name. In this respect mar- 
riage is following the drift which Sir Henry Maine has 
pointed out as characteristic of progressive society, the 
drift from status to contract. 
A second permanent cause lies in the increase of the 
conception of marriage as a relation essentially secular. 
This conception lies at the basis of modern divorce legisla- 
tion, which recognizes the right of the individual and the 
right of the State to an interest in the dissolution of the 
marriage tie. It does not in the least recognize any 
peculiarly sacred character in the institution. The growth, 
moreover, of atheistic and socialistic principles in society 
has weakened in the popular mind the conception of mar- 
riage as a Divine ordinance, and therefore as a tie of perma- 
nently binding force. To those who eliminate God from 
the world it becomes an easy task to rob marriage of its 
sacred character. The institution of marriage rests upon a 
triangular base. It is founded upon the interest of the in- 
dividual, upon the interest of the State and upon Divine 
ordinance. To weaken this foundation upon any side 
causes the structure to totter. 
Rise or Women a Disruptive Factor 
Another cause lies in the enlargement of the social and 
political condition of women. Notable and most worthy 
as it is, this condition, taken all in all and through all the 
decades, has worked toward the disruption of the family. 
Woman’s sphere of activities has broadened in every 
direction. In nearly every business, trade and profession 
women now appear as the competitors cf men. Seventy 
years ago the boundaries of the sphere of woman’s work 
were limited. The industries in which she now engages
-P-A-G-E-306
  $00 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
are numbered by the hundreds. Such a radical change, 
made in so short a time, cannot fail to exercise a disturb- 
ing effect on the family. If a woman fail to find happi- 
ness, justice and recognition of her personality in her po- 
sition as wife and mother, she is now independent of this 
_ Position, so far as the supply of her needs is concerned. 
Means of a decent livelihood for a competent woman open 
on every side. 
The educational advantages for women have kept pace 
with their enlarged opportunities. The education of the 
average American woman, so far as it pertains to a know- 
ledge of books, is doubtless superior to that of the average 
man. Especially is this true in the middle class, a class 
among which the rate of divorce is by far the highest. 
Among this class in the older States the intellectual supe- 
riority of the wife to the husband is plain to even a casual 
observer. 
To these causes of disruption, more or less permanent, I 
would add causes which seem to me to be of immediate and 
timely import. They are causes which have specially 
operated in the first decades of this century. There are at 
least three classes of such causes. The first class lies in 
what is still called woman’s suffrage. 
The giving of the vote to women is right, has long been 
right, and is certain to result in the greatest good to the 
greatest number for the greatest length of time. But, for 
the time being, the effect on the family is, in my opinion, 
disintegrating. For this enlarged suffrage represents an 
enlarged application and a deeper development of the prin- 
ciple of individualism. The suffrage represents an in- 
crease in woman’s rights without a corresponding increase 
in her duties. It may, or it may not, result ina movement 
toward the dissolution of the family, but it does work 
toward failure to found a family. 
Woman has thus come into a larger and freer life. Wo-
-P-A-G-E-307
CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 301 
man suffrage is at least a partial declaration of social in- 
dependence. It is a token that women have other, and to 
some, more agreeable, methods of making their contribu- 
tion to human affairs than by way of marriage. This 
movement contains factors and bears meanings of un- 
speakable beneficence to the race. But, for the day, the. 
effect on the family, as one of the institutions of society, is 
to lessen its primacy and to narrow its functions. 
Errect or UNEMPLOYMENT 
A second cause in respect to the individual relates to un- 
employment. Regular and constant work and regular 
and constant wages sustain and protect the home.  Ir- 
regular and inconstant work means irregular and incon- 
stant wages. Irregular and inconstant wages mean a home 
of anxiety and probably of hardship. The anxiety of hus- 
band and of wife tends to create moods and feelings which 
tend in turn toward separation in heart, mind, service. 
The husband, keenly conscious that he is failing to bring 
provision into the home, is inclined to think of himself as a 
failure. Under this thought he is prone to be a coward and 
to flee from the domestic prison. If, in the unemployment 
of the husband, the wife becomes a wage-earner, the disso- 
lution of the family is also promoted, for the wife and 
mother holds the home together by her presence, as well as 
by her daily and hourly toil. Removed from the home, in 
order to bring money into the home, the removal tends to 
dissipate the uniting and controlling forces and the benefi- 
cent atmosphere of the home itself. 
Somewhat akin to the causes found in the individual, 
tending toward domestic dissolution, is a cause residing 
in the family itself — the tendency to transfer the duties 
and the rights, formerly belonging to the family, to public 
agencies. In this remark I have in mind children chiefly. 
The public schools, long ago, took charge of the instruction
-P-A-G-E-308
302 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
of children. The advantages are of unspeakable value. 
Children are now “farmed out”; they go to the public 
playground for their play; they go to the Y.M.C.A. and 
the Y.W.C.A., or to the social settlement, for their indoor 
sports and games and baths; they form themselves into 
companies of Boy Scouts or of Campfire Girls. These and 
other agencies are most beneficent. They represent posi- 
tive increments to the well-being of society. For the time, 
nevertheless, they tend to depreciate the home as a social 
unit and to lessen its formative force. 
To the powers looking toward the dissolution of the fam- 
ily, already named, are to be added the powers found in the 
community as a whole. 
The family, in the first twenty years of the present cen- 
tury, and especially in the last eight years, has suffered 
from the general lawlessness of the community. By law- 
lessness I mean both positive law-breaking and also the 
absence of a general respect for law. Of the positive law- 
breakings, each day brings abounding evidence. Upon the 
pages of any paper of a morning, even of one which belongs 
to the better class, what do you find? I copy some head- 
lines of a journal that lies on my desk as I write: “Black 
Hand Poised to Strike Verottas and Save Comrades — 
Police Guard Slain Boy’s Family Night and Day After 
Murder Attempt — Parents Terrorized to Keep Them 
from Telling Story of Kidnapping and Death”; “Starts 
New Inquiry of Taylor Murder”; “5000 Ulster Police 
Patrol the Border — More Kidnappings”; “Grand Jury 
Inquiry Into Bucket Shops”; “Indict ex-Pugilist in the 
Rickard Case.” Similar headlines can be found in any 
daily paper. In such conditions of confusion and of crim- 
inality, the family cannot flourish, any more than a flower 
garden can flourish on a shell-plowed battlefield. 
With such lawlessness and criminal conditions is to be 
joined the condition of general social unsettlement of judg-
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 303 
ment and of orderliness, which has been accentuated by 
the war and by the war’s aftermath. Soldiers find it hard 
to take up regular daily duties. The dissipation of inter- 
ests, the emotionalism of army life, do not lend themselves 
to the routine of business. The struggle for a bonus, how- 
ever well this may be deserved, has in it many undesirable 
elements. The struggle tends to produce a maximum of 
uncertainty in judgment and a minimum of efficiency. Of 
course the family is the victim of the consequent suffering. 
Interests Outsipn Tar Home 
A third cause is found in the increase of interests outside 
the home. What one might call the Australian condition 
is coming to prevail in America. A recent novel, published 
in Australia (The Australians, by Arthur H. Adams) says: 
“The Australian regards home as a convenient place for 
sleeping in and having breakfast in. Most Australian 
girls use their homes as business men use their clubs — and 
there is no sacredness about clubs.” 
As a part of this enlargement of interests foreign to the 
home, a distinct place should be given to the increase of 
the attention paid to amusements. The current popular 
amusements, especially the ‘“‘movies,” are prone to be 
cheap in content, even if not cheap in money, and tend to 
disorganize the more worthy elements and to lower the 
moral standards of the family. 
We do not yet understand the significance of the 
“movie” movement. I am told that one fifth of all the 
population of this country visits the movies in a single day. 
The business has become one of the largest industries. 
If the influence of the movie is one fourth good it is three 
fourths bad for the family. If it gives interest to a family 
of an evening, and it undoubtedly does, it tends also to 
separate the members from each other, to familiarize them 
with crimes and with methods of committing crimes, to lay  
-P-A-G-E-310
  $04 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
emphasis rather on the bold and the daring than on the 
noble and the beneficent, to give irregular and ill-adjusted 
knowledge without disciplining the reasoned judgment. 
Such a cause is linked immediately with the weakened 
ties of the neighborhood and of neighborliness. Proximity 
does not produce neighborliness. Neighborliness repre- 
sents understandings, sympathies, social supports. The 
individual home gets strength for its integrity from other 
homes nearby. When the surrounding social supports are 
removed, when the sustaining social atmosphere is poi- 
soned, the individual family is made feeble. It becomes 
easier for it to fall and to fall into ruin. 
The last of the six causes which I name, as found in the 
community, rests in the lessened influence of the Protestant 
Church. This is a fact which, for the time, I assume is 
existing. In certain social zones the Church has not lost 
influence. It has not lost influence in parts of the urban 
community. The Church has, however, lost influence in 
the country districts. These districts still represent about 
one half of the entire population. The Protestant Church, 
like the Catholic Church, stands for the primal worth of 
the family. One of the mightiest and most beneficent of 
the effects of the coming of Christianity lies in the building 
of the family altar upon the foundation of pure marriage. 
The blessing to the individual man and woman, the 
blessing to the race, thus given, no words can worthily ap- 
preciate. But, for the time, the Protestant Church, in 
failing to take its place as a worthy force in the community, 
is also failing to support the family. The general religious 
lapse contributes to individual and domestic disintegra- 
tion. 
As opposing these individual causes which tend to dis- 
integrate the family, I may cite certain conditions and 
facts which promote the integrity of the home. 
One of these conditions relates to the increasing sense
-P-A-G-E-311
CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 805 
of responsibility of a part of the community for the other 
part. A distinguished pathologist has said that about one 
half of all the people are committed to the intellectual and 
moral guidance of the other half. The least able half con- 
tains all degrees of inabilities. These degrees run from the 
slightly feeble-minded through the moron group to the 
idiotic. This sense of the duty of the more able to care for 
the less able, has become regnant. It is recognized that 
among the feeble-minded, the so-called sex problem is not 
weak or feeble, but most virulent. It is also recognized 
that divorces are more liable to occur in this class. The 
feeble-minded represent the feeble-hearted and the feeble- 
hearted represent the feeble-willed. The feeble-minded, 
the feeble-hearted and the feeble-willed become the 
“rounders” in the divorce courts. “Rounders” in the 
divorce courts are quite as numerous and as threatening as 
they are in the charitable relief societies or in the police 
courts. The abler part of the community is now becoming 
aware of the responsibilities committed to its members for 
the guardianship of their wards, and also for the protection 
of society from the ravages of the self-perpetuation of the 
least worthy part of the human species. 
Another beneficent cause, which has become of greater 
value in the last two decades, lies in the stronger emphasis 
laid on the higher education of women and in the increasing 
influence of liberally educated women in the community. 
Of the fact there is no doubt. For evidence do not consult 
the alumne records; they may be partial witnesses. The 
newspapers give the most impartial testimony. Consult, 
too, the proleptical records of admissions of girls to the 
colleges. The last anticipative registration of a future 
student of which I have heard was that of a little girl for 
the class of 1942, in Vassar College. Consult in evidence 
also published announcements and the table of contents of 
the magazines and reviews. Look at the list of teachers in  
-P-A-G-E-312
  
  306 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
the high schools and colleges. Look at the professional 
registers. 
Such women, even though they have decided that call- 
ings other than conjugal are imperative for themselves, 
admit that the family is central, that the family is foremost, 
that the family is compelling. No type of family is happier 
than that composed of two college graduates. No family 
is more useful. In no family are children more worthily 
nurtured. The annulment of marriage, or the dissolution 
of the family, is the least common in a family composed of 
college graduates. 
PROHIBITION BENEFICENT 
A further beneficent cause lies in prohibition. Prohibi- 
tion has come to have a narrow and special meaning, re- 
ferring to the sale or use of alcoholic stimulants. I assume, 
and believe, that prohibition will finally prohibit. For the 
time, through the mood of daring and acts of daredeviltry, 
it may not prohibit. But ultimately, in a generation, it 
will have accomplished its purpose as completely as any 
statute or section of the Constitution. Prohibition will 
limit economic waste; prohibition will promote proper 
physical development of the individual; prohibition will aid 
in the restraint of sexual appetite; prohibition will ennoble 
the quality and enrich the happiness of the mother. Such 
results of constant and enlarging power tend to develop 
the best family. 
Opposing waves are beating upon the institution of the 
home. One is the demand for families of general culture 
and social worth. This demand is usually made of the 
Anglo-Saxon family, and with such a demand is implied 
a family of small size. The contrast is drawn between the 
few children of the Anglo-Saxon and the many children of 
the home of the races of Southeastern Europe. One wave 
sometimes bears the name of birth control, a method of 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 807 
conclusion not designed to touch chiefly the Anglo-Saxon 
family, but the family which is inclined to accept children 
to a number larger than it can care for. 
In the midst of these difficulties the only guiding prin- 
ciple is that the quality of the family should be of the high- 
est, even if the numbers are not of the largest. Let the 
children be many, or let the children be few, let the home 
be elaborate, or let the home be simple, let the family be 
wealthy or let the family be poor, but let the type of life be 
high. Let the maternal love be wise as well as affectionate, 
and the paternal power be affectionate as well as wise. Let 
the domestic relations create, not communal liabilities, but 
communal assets. Let the lasting, fundamental, social 
principles of the family be interpreted, accepted, obeyed. 
A second support would lie i uniformity of our divorce 
laws. Such uniformity would aid in the avoidance of 
various legal entanglements and domestic complications 
which are at times indeed abnormal, and often so abnormal 
as to be amusing, even while they are heartbreaking. 
Marre 1s A SACRAMENT 
A third support and principle is ever to be emphasized. 
Regard and reverence should be paid to marriage, the 
foundation of the home, as a sacrament. In the Roman 
Catholic Church marriage is one of the seven sacraments. 
As stated in The Law of Christian Marriage, by the Reverend 
A. Devine: “Matrimony is a sacrament which gives grace 
to the husband and wife to live happily together, and bring 
up their children in the fear and love of God.” 
Marriage ought to be ever, and everywhere, a means of 
inward grace. The practice of the Roman Catholic Church 
in respect to the prohibition of divorce, inevitably flows 
from its sacramental doctrine. The record of the Protes- 
tant Church, made through its clergymen and ordained 
priests in the marriage of divorced persons, represents an 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  3808 FAMILY AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
anti-sacramental interpretation. The record intimates 
that marriage is regarded as a contractual relation. One 
may not go so far as to say that no clergyman should offi- 
ciate at the marriage of divorced parties, but one is justified 
in saying that the Church is injured in the home of its 
friends, and injured beyond the home of its friends, in 
priests marrying certain persons who are divorced. 
In particular, it may be added, that the injury in public 
repute becomes the greater as the causes of the previously 
given divorce are the more notorious, and as the persons 
themselves are notorious. In public reports, the amount 
of the fee paid is frequently and sensationally connected 
with the fact of the marriage. I for one, as a Protestant, 
and as one ordained to the Protestant ministry, should be 
glad to see marriage lifted to the rank of a sacrament, with 
baptism and the communion. 
The remedies or counteractives I have named — an in- 
creased emphasis upon the quality of the family life, the 
uniformity of divorce laws, and the elevation of marriage 
as a sacrament — may seem to be narrow, superficial and 
ineffective. These remedies are unworthy of the serious- 
ness of the condition, unworthy of the fundamental char- 
acter and place of the family as a great historic institution 
of human society. There is, therefore, need of emphasis 
on the one great, central element in human life — the 
element of the divine character of human life. 
For man is more than nature; his destiny more infinite 
than his nurture. The animate is more precious than the 
inanimate. The work of the sixth day of the creative week 
is more worthy of the Divine Creator than the work of any 
preceding day. From life comes the family, and in life is 
the family. It is an institution which some would affirm is 
more important than any other. The family in turn is 
founded upon marriage. It is, as I have said, a natural, a 
historical, a social, a legal, a national, and an ecclesiastical
-P-A-G-E-315
  CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING 309 
unit. The gateway to it, therefore, is to be guarded by 
angels, by angels with flaming swords. 
To the unworthy, to the impure in heart, to those seeking 
marriage as a commercial union, the angels with flaming 
swords should stand, giving fear and hastening flight. To 
the worthy, to the pure in heart, to the tender in soul, the 
angels, even if armed with flaming swords, should bear 
preservation and protection. Marriage is a blessed ideal 
of youth. The holy family is a blessed ideal of humanity. 
Let the community seek to transmute the ideal of youth 
into a method and means for the realization of its ideal 
of the family as a central aim and controlling force in the 
making of the noblest race.

  WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW 
RENAISSANCE ! 
LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 
Desprre the disturbing condition of world politics, there is 
a widespread consensus of opinion that we are perhaps on 
the eve of a great spiritual and intellectual change. Signs 
of it are abundant in many diverse fields. The politicians 
and the scientists, the captains of industry and the artists, 
the younger school of writers and the younger school of 
preachers, all feel that what our society is in need of is a 
great inward transformation, and that men’s minds are 
awakened to the need. And it is not these open and articu- 
late expressions which are the most significant; it is the 
response that they arouse from readers and audiences, from 
sections of opinion and centers of sentiment, which could 
not have framed or formulated the expression themselves. 
It is the plain people, the humble, unintellectual multi- 
tude, which is most aware of the failure of the isms and 
ologies, of the outward remedies and systems, and which 
welcomes most eagerly the idea that the big movement of 
the coming generation, the rebirth of our troubled society, 
must proceed from within; that it is not now a matter of 
reforming society in order to liberate the individual, but of 
helping individuals to liberate themselves, in order that 
they may be the nuclei, the radiating centers, of a free and 
joyous society. 
Yet in all this discussion, in all this literature of hope and 
encouragement, there has been one significant omission. 
One vital element in the problem has been, if not forgotten

the editor and the author.
-P-A-G-E-317
  LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 311 
at least ignored. We have been told to go back to the in- 
dividual, but we have not asked ourselves who the “‘in- 
dividual” is. We have not sufficiently faced the fact or 
the implications of the fact that the individual is no longer, 
as was the tacit assumption of reformers in previous ages, 
man, but man and woman; and we have failed to allow for 
the influence which this elementary, but all-important, 
fact must exercise upon our plans and visions of a new 
society. 
No candid and thoughtful observer of contemporary 
European and American society can deny that it is racked 
by the problem of sex relationships. If it is true that the 
industrial revolution and the coming of a machine age have 
destroyed the balance between traditional social classes, 
between town and country, even between Europe and the 
other continents, it is equally true that modern indus- 
trialism and modern education, acting together, have de- 
stroyed the old relationship between the sexes. Woman 
has been awakened and in part emancipated, but she has 
not yet found her place in the new order of society. A 
true balance between the sexes has not been established in 
our modern life, Man and woman, together the authors 
and distributors of life, have not learned to act together 
and to harmonize their intellectual and spiritual contribu- 
tion. From this inner disharmony and disorder spring 
countless troubles and difficulties in the outer world. If 
the secrets of all hearts and all homes could be revealed, 
how many of the personal failures and political and social 
distresses of the present moment could be traced back to 
misunderstanding and incompatibilities arising out of sex 
relationships! Charity, as we all know, begins at home; 
but so also does renaissance. It is in our own homes, and 
not only in the kitchen and the drawing-room, but in the 
privacies of the intimate life and in the too little analyzed 
recesses of the mind and spirit, that the cleansing process  
-P-A-G-E-318
  312 WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW RENAISSANCE 
must begin. To clean the outside of the cup and the plat- 
ter has always been an impressive and sensational program 
for the unthinking multitude or for the Pharisee afraid of 
introspection. But we have long since been warned of its 
insufficiency. - He who preached to the Messianic enthu- 
siasts and reformers of his day that the kingdom of heaven 
was within them would be the first to tell us to-day to look 
into our own hearts, to sweep out with the broom of self- 
analysis the dust-bins which lurk there, and to set the pro- 
blem of sex relationship in the very center of the movement 
toward spiritual renaissance. 
Woman’s case against man, reduced to its simplest terms, 
can be stated in a single phrase: he has made of her a con- 
venience. There were ages in which it was more conven- 
ient to him to enslave her; others when it was more con- 
venient to flatter and pamper; others again when his pur- 
pose could best be served by granting a fictitious equality, 
with the dice heavily loaded against her. But whatever 
the outward circumstances, and despite examples set by en- 
lightened persons in almost every age, the broad general 
fact remains that men have used women selfishly and in- 
considerately, not as equals, but as instruments to minister 
to their own purposes. It has been a man-made society, 
and women have had to take the position assigned to them, 
whether kindly or roughly, by the dominant sex. 
In some very important respects the spiritual teachings 
of the Christian Church were less favorable to women than 
the classical influences which preceded them. It is one of 
the great historical misfortunes of the sex that the first 
great Christian organizer happened to be a misogynist. 
Saint Paul is the fountainhead — let us be frank and say 
the muddy fountainhead — of the traditional teaching of 
the Christian Church about the impurity of the body, 
the glory of celibacy, the inferiority of women, and the 
acquiescence in marriage as a physical safety-valve. In
-P-A-G-E-319

these days, when we are trying to reassess the values of our 
traditional Christianity and to relate what is divine and 
enduring in it to the discoveries and inquiries of modern 
science, it is well for us to recognize frankly the immeasur- 
able damage done by Paul not only to the personality of 
woman, but to the cause of human decency. To turn 
back from the discussions and investigations of modern 
doctors and psychologists to the famous verses on mar- 
riage in the seventh chapter of First Corinthians is like 
passing from civilization to pre-civilization. As a human 
document as a study in sex psychology, it is full of interest; 
but to realize that these harsh, bitter, legalistic, and aggres- 
sively masculine phrases were accepted literally by pro- 
fessing Christians for many centuries is to stand appalled 
at the vagaries of “progress.” For had it not been for Paul 
and his sex embitterment, the truer teaching of the gospel 
might have won through; and how great and gracious 
would have been the change! 
The Renaissance marked a sharp break with the Pauline 
tradition, but if the body was restored to its rights, and 
fresh air was let in on the stuffy asceticism of the Middle 
Ages, it was man rather than woman who benefited by the 
change. Moreover, both of the Reformation and the 
Catholic Counter-Reformation, both the Puritans and the 
Jesuits, each in their own way, closed the window again 
and once more polluted the atmosphere. During the last 
four centuries woman has been increasingly felt to be a 
moving force in modern society, and individual women and 
individual groups of women have had large achievements 
to their credit; but society as a whole has still treated them 
as a convenience, and their distinctive gifts have received 
no real recognition in the modern community. They have 
often prepared and contributed to intellectual movements, 
but seldom have they benefited by their fruits. Queen 
Margaret of Navarre in the Renaissance, Queen Elizabeth

in the growth of British sea-power, the women of the Hétel 
Rambouillet in the French literary movement of the seven- 
teenth century, the salons of Paris in preparing men’s 
minds for the French Revolution, and a long roll of illus- 
trious women in England, France, Germany, Scandinavia, 
Poland, Rumania, and Russia, from Madame de Staél and 
the Brontés to the Carmen Sylvas and the Madame Curies 
of our own day — all these have been stimulating and in- 
spiring forces in their time, though for the most part they 
have passed from the stage as lonely and unrewarded pio- 
neers. Men benefited by their labors, but did not crown 
them with the one reward which would have been appre- 
ciated — the grant of full, frank, and uncondescending 
equality. ; 
The nineteenth century brought a great outward change 
in the place of women. ‘The industrial revolution, by 
destroying domestic industries, deprived woman of much of 
her household occupation. In many cases the result was 
that Martha followed her work to the factory. Woman 
became engulfed in the vortex in consequence of indus- 
trialism. 
This brought with it new social and political relation- 
ships, culminating in the grant of woman suffrage in most 
industrial countries. But the equality thus conceded was 
more apparent than real. No one surveying either the 
political or the industrial system of the countries in which 
women have voting rights could detect there any signs of 
real sex equality arising out of that fact. The truth is that 
men have allowed women to share in industrial work as a 
convenience, because they needed them, and have granted 
them the vote as the best means of dealing with the diffi- 
cult and equivocal situation thus brought about. Despite 
women workers and women voters disharmony and dis- 
order still prevail, and man still dominates the social scene. 
What can be done to bring order out of this disorder?
-P-A-G-E-321
LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 815 
How can women be enabled to make their contribution to 
the new renaissance? What must we do to secure that this 
impending movement shall not be one-sided, arrogant, 
and ultimately, sterile, like so many of its predecessors? 
The answer seems easy. We must treat women as 
women, as the equals, not the inferiors, the collaborators, 
not the instruments, of men. Men must treat them as 
such, and women must think of themselves and of other 
women as such. We must aim at a society which will bea 
diversity, not a uniformity, a harmonization, not a stand- 
ardization, an orchestra, not a masculine solo. We must 
find room in our social arrangements and in our hearts and 
minds for the distinctive gifts and qualities of women, for 
their quick intuition, their eye for character and individual- 
ity, their sense of the shades and nuances, the priceless 
details and delicacies of life, for their power of harmonizing 
and adjusting the big rough blocks which masculine energy 
is forever rolling pell-mell on the stage, and leaving there 
in bewildering disarray. We must allow woman to play on 
equal terms, unimpeded by masculine condescension and 
interference, her part as wife and mother, as hostess and 
diplomat, as talker and letter-writer, as artist and intel- 
lectual, as a lover of ideas and of truth, as a lover of ideals 
and of the good, above all as a lover of that outward and 
inward beauty which man in his love for wealth and power, 
for size and statistics, has well nigh exiled from this poor 
man-handled world. 
All this is easy preaching and will win easy assent, but 
what does it mean in the concrete? It means, in the first 
place, a revolution in the character of women’s education, 
at least as it is in Great Britain and North America. Dur- 
ing the course of the nineteenth century, when women be- 
gan increasingly to engage in occupations outside the home, 
the pioneers of girls’ education, anxious for academic 
equality for their sex, developed systems and curricula, and
-P-A-G-E-322
  316 WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW RENAISSANCE 
sometimes even recreations and amusements, which were a 
conscious imitation of the traditional arrangements for 
boys and young men. In England the higher education of 
women may be said, broadly speaking, to be carried on by 
spinsters on lines imitated from the men’s public schools 
and universities, and sometimes, as in the women’s colleges 
at Oxford and Cambridge, in actual collaboration with 
them. In the United States and Canada the movement 
has gone further, and actual coeducation, both in the 
secondary school and the college stage, is rather the rule 
then the exception. The result in both countries has been, 
again speaking broadly, disastrous. The English system has 
produced the “hockey-girl” and the high-school teacher 
or academic bluestocking, both of them types diverg- 
ing palpably and unpleasantly from the normal perfection 
of their sex. The American system has produced the 
peculiar combination of feminine seductiveness and mas- 
culine efficiency variously known as the “coed,” the office 
girl, the bachelor girl, and the flirt. Let it be added, in 
fairness to women on both sides of the Atlantic, that side 
by side with these novel types, products of a novel system 
or of novel conditions, there are innumerable examples 
which testify to the living power and enduring qualities 
of British and American womanhood. But in too many 
cases these are not products of the new system of women’s 
education, but have grown up despite it. How often, in 
analyzing such cases, is it discovered to be due either to 
special home influences or to some older and wiser system 
of education! 
The higher education of women in Great Britain, in the 
existing state of sex relationship in that country, tends to 
blunt the edges and sensibilities of the feminine intellect 
and to repress the natural development of the life of feeling. 
The academic developments of the last fifty years have, it 
is true, led to certain improvements in the state of the law
-P-A-G-E-323
  
LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 317 
as regards the property and dignity of woman, but as re- 
gards the central problem, the sex relationship itself, they 
have done little or nothing. It is not the college woman, 
but women writers and artists and other rebel folk, most 
of them not college-bred, who have tried to face these ques- 
tions and to let the sunlight into the dark places, while their 
better-educated sisters have been restrained by traditional 
inhibitions that their education has only served to rein- 
force. No observer of English life, aware of the grim sig- 
nificance of the fact that there are nearly two million 
more women than men, can help shuddering over the vast 
amount of suppressed and silent suffering, of sex starvation, 
embitterment, ill health, and unhappiness which post-war 
Great Britain is harboring at the present time. In such an 
atmosphere women are either driven in upon themselves 
or driven out to feverish and distracting activities, to com- 
mittees and philanthropies and efficiencies. But both 
these modes of living are equally far from the rule of life 
contemplated by Him who came to show men and women 
how to live and to live more abundantly. 
In America the atmosphere is freer, brighter, and, on the 
surface, opener. There are fewer inhibitions and sup- 
pressions, less stagnant, untouched nastiness. Men and 
women talk more, and allow themselves to think more in 
sex questions, and there is a greater recognition of the 
essential differences between men’s and women’s qualities. 
But though differentiation is the basis of equal collabora- 
tion, it does not presuppose its attainment; and no visitor 
to the United States can help being struck by the fact that 
the boys and girls, the young men and women, who grew up 
at school and college together, pursue their lives, as mar- 
ried men and women, more independently and in greater 
mutual isolation than is the custom for married couples in 
any other modern country. Marriage in America, so far 
from being a partnership of soul, body, and mind, is too
-P-A-G-E-324
  318 WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW RENAISSANCE 
often merely a convenient nucleus for separate interests, 
separate activities, separate ways of thinking and feeling — 
in a word, for two separate ways of life. The difference 
between marriage and divorce is not the difference between 
union and separation, but between lives running parallel 
and lives divergent. 
If women are to play their part in our renaissance, they 
must play it as women, not as the nerve-racked, restless, 
hysterical half-women who fill a large place in our contem- 
porary movements, or as mere skillful, but unconvincing, 
imitators of men. Women are physically, intellectually, 
even spiritually different from men; that is why they need 
a different education, if not in subjects, at least in methods 
of approach. And that is also why men need to make an 
effort to understand the mind and quality, the distinctive 
soul and personality, that is too often left hidden beneath 
the pretty exterior which is all that a man has accustomed 
himself to look for. True collaboration between man and 
woman is not easy; if it were, it would not remain over as 
the last outstanding task of civilization. But if it is not 
easy, it is vastly worth while; it is the greatest single source 
of human happiness, and the very corner-stone of a stable 
human society. 
Let us attempt briefly to trace the movement of this new 
principle of sex collaboration along the pathway of modern 
life. Not long ago a baby girl who had come into the world 
in a lying-in hospital near New York was rejected by her 
parents, who declared that it was a boy that they wanted 
and that they were sure it was a boy that had been born to 
them. On the threat of legal action they agreed to acknow- 
ledge the child, but what a life lies before this infant whose 
very cradle has been embittered by the stigma of sex in- 
feriority! Yet the incident is only a frank revelation of a 
traditional and still prevalent attitude. The Greeks ex- 
pose their unwanted baby girls; we cover them with a hypo-
-P-A-G-E-325
  LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 319 
critical and condoling condescension. It seems as though 
our unduly concrete minds could not get over the fact 
that the central figure in the Christmas story which em- 
bodies for us the glory of babyhood is a bambino and not a 
bambina. In a truly civilized society the infant girl would 
rank from the first moment of her conscious being as the 
equal of the infant boy. Mothers take good care to dis- 
cover the suitable color and adornment for their little ones, 
blue for the little boy, pink for the little girl, but the care 
bestowed on this outward differentiation is too seldom 
extended to the tasks of inner understanding and harmoni- 
zation. 
The same condescension and neglect are to be found in 
the school to which the six-year-old infant proceeds. On 
the plea that twice two makes four for a girl just as it does 
for a boy, the teaching art has been blunted and standard- 
ized without reference to the needs and desires, the pecul- 
iar receptivities and characteristics of all the blossoming 
variety of girlhood and boyhood stiffly displayed upon the 
school benches. The baleful science of pedagogy, that 
compost of stale “tips for teachers” and of old-fashioned 
and wooden psychological formule, has degraded teaching 
to a dreary, undiscriminating routine, chilling to boys and 
girls alike, and pedantry and poor prospects combined 
have kept away from the teaching profession, both in 
Great Britain and the United States, just that family of 
spirits, those lovers and born teachers of human kind, who 
are needed in our schools if school is to supply, as it can 
and should, the deficiencies of the modern home. 
What is needed to improve our schools for young chil- 
dren is no ingenious tinkering with the curriculum, no 
patching with this or that fashionable fad, but simply 
better teaching, or, in other words teachers who are live, 
observant, and sensitive human beings, working under 
conditions in which their natural insight and love of their  
-P-A-G-E-326
820 WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW RENAISSANCE 
pupils can bear fruit; teachers to whom each child, boy or 
girl, Anglo-Saxon, Slav or Latin, Jew, Greek, or colored 
barbarian, is a treasure-house to be unlocked, a riddle to 
be solved, a unique human soul to be loved. 
At the adolescent stage, however, the plot thickens. 
Coeducation, far from solving the problem, intensifies it. 
If the needs of a little girl are different from the needs of a 
little boy, the needs of adolescents of the two sexes are 
still more difficult to harmonize. Sex begins to enter in, 
vivifying and energizing, yet at the same time ebullient 
and confusing. To ignore it, to try to keep the atmosphere 
“healthy” by “counter-attractions,” by sport and gym- 
nastics and even by dancing, is to bury one’s head ostrich- 
like in the sand. Far better frankly to recognize that 
during these difficult years all intellectual work is pursued 
under an inevitable disadvantage, and that intellectual 
collaboration between the sexes is embarrassed by their 
unequal rate of growth. Coeducation carries with it, no 
doubt, certain “social” benefits; but it is precisely in the 
classroom that it is seen at its weakest, as any sincere 
teacher who has tried to teach mixed adolescent classes 
will admit. When our teachers and ministers are frank 
enough to acknowledge, and to draw the inevitable con- 
clusions from, the physical facts of the adolescent period 
for boys and girls alike, the atmosphere of our schools will 
be less unreal and more edifying, and the old ceremony of 
confirmation may once more be worthy of a name that has 
been abused by many generations of flabby pastors. 
The sex problem at our universities is familiar ground. 
Every one knows, although few will admit, that coeduca- 
tion and collaboration are far from synonymous terms; 
that college, while tending to bring the sexes together for 
the pastimes and dissipations of idle hours, has done little 
to promote that true marriage of minds for which common 
arrangements for study were presumably devised, and that, 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 321 
as has already been said, the most obvious result of the 
bringing together of the two sexes at college, apart from 
the happy exceptions who conspicuously illustrate the 
tule, is the persistent division between the activities of 
college men and college women in after life. 
Here, again, the remedy is not hard to find. Smaller 
classes, more discriminative tuition —in a word, real 
teaching is the solution. The subjects of university study 
are the same for all, but this does not mean that their 
handling must be the same. Just as there is an English 
approach to Hellenism, and a German approach and an 
American approach, so also there is a man’s approach and 
a woman’s approach. Collaboration between the sexes, 
as between scholars of different nations, is the natural cul- 
mination of sincere and sustained study, not its inevitable 
accompaniment. If our existing coeducation were success- 
ful, we should witness its fruits not so much in the class- 
room or in the degree lists, where in any case no mature 
fruits are to be looked for, but in the after careers of the 
students and, above all, in the homes of the professors 
themselves. But, let it be added in passing, if the case of 
M. and Mme. Curie is exceptional in academic life, the fact 
that a low salary scale has turned the professor’s wife into 
a domestic drudge must not be overlooked. 
After school and university comes the school of life, 
What of the sex relationship to-day in that wider sphere? 
Has not the problem been solved once and for all by the 
passing of the nineteenth amendment? So we might be- 
lieve if we accepted the standards and attitudes of the con- 
ventional drawing-room and tea-table, closing our eyes and 
ears to the sex disturbance that surrounds us, and refusing, 
above all, to reflect on the record written within our own 
hearts and minds. How many mature men and women are 
there in our modern society who can look back without re- 
gret and even without shame over their own sex history,
-P-A-G-E-328
3822 WOMAN’S PART IN THE NEW RENAISSANCE 
over its obscure, repressed, and embarrassed beginnings, 
its blind timidities and equally blind audacities, its cruel 
and unnecessary ordeals, its long and painful passage 
through the dark forest before it at length emerged, if it has 
emerged, into the sunlight of an integrated life? And who 
is there who can pass through our Broadways and Picca- 
dillys and other centers of Christian civilization and society 
in night-time without being overcome by shame at the de- 
stiny to which the call of sex and the call of convention, in 
unholy alliance, have condemned thousands and even mil- 
lions of girls and women? Here is a flaming denial to the 
bourgeois optimism of those who are satisfied with the 
externalities of the nineteenth amendment and refuse to 
look more closely at the inside of the cup and the platter. 
So long as there is a host of prostitutes on our streets to 
assuage the appetites of dominant: masculinity and in the 
very homes from which their paymasters are drawn a host, 
equally unhappy and equally starved, of marriageable 
femininity pining away in the chains of a cowardly con- 
vention and cowardly self-ignorance, so long will there re- 
main a glaring incompatibility in our outer life and a dis- 
tracting incoherence in our inner natures. 
These things have often been pointed out before. They 
have usually been met either by fatalistic acquiescence or 
by vague and unhelpful preachments. But it was not so 
that the founder of Christianity met them. He met them 
by analysis and understanding — an analysis so frank and 
searching, and understanding so intimate and loving, that a 
lazy world has preferred to sentimentalize a situation which 
it needs hard thinking to understand. But He who called 
Himself the son of man, the typical man, was not a senti- 
mentalist, nor even a preacher. He was a teacher and a 
doctor, and when he was faced with the problem of Mary 
Magdalene, or with her more conventional sisters, such as 
Martha, he knew, what the modern world has forgotten 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
LUCIE A. ZIMMERN 823 
in its specialisms, that mind and body must be treated 
together. It is through sincere self-analysis and sincere 
observation, through clean thinking as the source of clean 
living, through the courage to set the big and the little 
things of life in the right perspective and proportion, to set 
love, for instance, above convention, and happiness above 
riches, that modern men and women can find the way out 
of our present perplexities; and it is through the enlistment 
of courageous pioneers, men and women alike, into the 
army of teachers, those teachers who, despised like the 
British Contemptibles of 1914, are yet the crucial factor in 
the situation, that men and women of the coming genera- 
tion, heirs of the knowledge and the self-knowledge of the 
ages, will at length be enabled to establish that equal and 
harmonious relationship that is the only enduring founda- 
tion for the good life for men and nations.

WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? ! 
BERTRAND RUSSELL 
Tue indispensable conditions for the existence of indus- 
trialism in a community may be said to be: large organiza- 
tions of workers engaged upon a common task; willingness 
in the directors of industry to forego present goods for 
future profit; an orderly and stable government, skilled 
workers, and scientific knowledge. Assuming that the con- 
ditions for the growth of industrialism exist, I want, in 
this paper to inquire what effects its growth is likely to 
have if it is not counterbalanced by other tendencies. 
Industrialism does not consist merely in large under- 
takings requiring a great number of workmen. The build- 
ing of the pyramids was a vast undertaking, but was not 
industrial. The essence of industrialism is the employ- 
ment of elaborate machinery and other means, such as 
railways, of diminishing the total labor of production. All 
the characteristics of industrialism are exemplified by the 
substitution of a bridge for a ferry, in spite of the fact 
that bridges existed before the industrial era. If a small 
number of men wish to cross a river, less labor is involved 
in taking them across in a boat than in building a bridge. 
But when very many wish to cross, the bridge involves an 
economy of labor, in spite of the fact that it is a much more 
serious matter to make a bridge than to make a boat. It 
is obvious, also, that the building of a bridge, except for 
military purposes, depends upon the expected preservation 
of some degree of law and order, both because a bridge is 
easily destroyed and because, in very unsettled times, no

    828 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
one can spare energy or thought for objects of which the 
advantage is in a more or less distant future. 
The essence of industrialism is the expenditure of much 
joint labor upon things that are not themselves consumable 
commodities, but merely means to the production of other 
things that are consumable. From this fundamental 
quality all the other characteristics of industrialism follow. 
The first thing to notice is that industrialism makes a 
society more organic, in the same sense in which the human 
body, which is a collection of cells, is more organic than a 
crowd of protozoa each consisting of a single cell. Each of 
the protozoa is capable of all the functions required for 
keeping alive; it does not need help from the others, and it 
does not die because they die. The cells composing the 
human body have no such independence; they have differ- 
ent functions, all necessary or at least useful for the life of 
the whole, and when any of the organs that perform vital 
functions are destroyed, the rest perish. The eyes can 
only see, the ears can only hear, and so on; an eye or an ear 
severed from the rest of the body cannot do what is nec- 
essary to keep alive, as the protozoa can. In this sacrifice 
of independence to codperation there is both loss and gain. 
There is loss in the fact that the whole assemblage of cells 
can be killed by one vital wound, and that, therefore, a 
human body has a more precarious life than a crowd of 
protozoa. But there is gain in the fact that by specializing 
the several organs become capable of doing work that no 
number of protozoa could do, and that the life of a human 
body is thus enriched and its responsiveness to its environ- 
ment enormously enhanced. Exactly parallel differences 
exist between an industrial and an unindustrial society. 
In a primitive pastoral or agricultural community, each 
family produces all that is needed for its own subsistence. 
The happiness of such a family has been depicted by Pope 
in the poem beginning:
-P-A-G-E-335
BERTRAND RUSSELL 829 
“Happy the man whose wish and care 
A few paternal acres bound.” 
But it may be doubted whether Pope would really have 
liked this state of affairs, since it would not have enabled a 
man to live by the sale of his verses. A society that allows 
such specialization is already on the road to industrialism. 
In an industrial community no man is self-subsistent; 
each man takes a part in a process that produces a great 
deal of some commodity or of some machine for making 
commodities, but no man produces the whole variety of 
commodities necessary for preserving life. Hence, trading, 
or at any rate, some form of exchange of products is abso- 
lutely necessary to survival wherever industry exists. The 
man engaged in a factory has to be fed and clothed by the 
labor of others and cannot even produce what is made in 
the factory without the machinery and the codperation of 
the other workers. He has ceased altogether to be an eco- 
nomically independent unit. The capitalist is at least 
equally dependent; if men would not work for him, he 
would starve. Agriculture, as it becomes more scientific, 
shares, though to a lesser degree, in the tendencies of in- 
dustry, as in the large-scale farming of the United States; 
it requires manures and machines that cannot be produced 
on the spot, but are often brought from great distances. 
Thus the whole community becomes knit together, so that 
the life of each depends upon the life of all. 
Like the human body, an industrial society has its vital 
organs, the destruction of which paralyzes the whole or- 
ganism. ‘This becomes increasingly true as industry be- 
comes more advanced and scientific. The destruction of a 
power-station may cause all the factories, trams, lights, 
and electric trains of a district to cease working. This is 
merely an example of the universal law that what is more 
highly organized is more sensitive. It follows that law- 
lessness and destructiveness can do far more harm in an  
-P-A-G-E-336
    
330 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
industrial community than they can where the methods of 
production are more primitive. 
As society grows more organic, it is inevitable that gov- 
ernment acquires more importance. The acts of individuals 
have more and more far-reaching effects upon others, and 
therefore require to be more and more controlled in the 
interests of the community. Hence a diminution of in- 
dividual liberty and of what may be called the anarchic 
side of life, that is, the side in which a man merely follows 
his own whims. If this side of life is to be in any degree 
preserved under industrialism, special measures will have 
to be taken to that end. 
Against the loss of liberty due to increase of government 
and organization, there is to be set a gain of liberty owing 
to the fact that the necessaries of life can be produced with 
less labor than in a pre-industrial society. The desires of 
an individual are subject to two kinds of restraint, namely, 
those due to the community and those due to material 
conditions. Industrialism, while it tends to increase the 
former, greatly diminishes the latter. The restraints im- 
posed by material conditions are primarily those involved 
in warding off death. Most animals owing to lack of fore- 
sight, die by starvation. Most human beings, owing to 
their possession of some slight degree of foresight, succeed 
in avoiding this form of death. But in a pre-industrial 
society they only succeed, unless they belong to the rich 
minority, by working hard almost all their lives in the pro- 
duction of food and other necessaries. This work is in it- 
self often irksome from its excessive amount, and is a com- 
plete obstacle to the realization of all desires for knowledge, 
beauty, or enjoyment. Such desires, where industry is 
undeveloped, can only be indulged by the fortunate few, 
kings, priests, and nobles. But under industrialism the 
production of necessaries requires only a small part of the 
energies of the community, all the rest being set free for the
-P-A-G-E-337
BERTRAND RUSSELL 331 
production of either leisure or luxuries, including among 
luxuries education, science, literature, art, and warfare. 
Thus man is rendered freer by industrialism, since his 
bondage to nature is diminished; but each separate man 
may not be freer, since there is an increase in the pressure 
of the community upon the individual. 
By diminishing man’s bondage to nature, industrialism 
has rendered physically possible many things of great value 
which were only very partially possible in earlier stages. 
The mere business of keeping alive is shared by man with 
the lower animals, and does not raise him above their level 
in any important respect. What raises him above the 
level of the animals is his mental capacity, which has 
brought with it desires that are not merely material. 
When men are liberated from the pressure of the struggle to 
obtain food, they do not all sink into sloth and idleness; 
some remain active, but in the pursuit of knowledge or art 
or some other purely mental object. It is the work of these 
men that sheds luster on mankind as a whole. To have 
lived a certain number of years, consumed a certain amount 
of food, begotten a certain number of children similar to 
oneself, and then died, is not the utmost of which men are 
capable; yet, owing to the scant productivity of labor, it 
was, until lately, all that most men could hope to achieve. 
Now, so far as physical conditions are concerned, better 
possibilities exist; education and sufficient leisure could, if 
we chose, exist throughout the whole community, and the 
business of keeping alive could become an easy and unim- 
portant part of our daily occupation. 
What is called civilization may be defined as the pur- 
suit of objects not biologically necessary for survival. It 
first arose through the introduction of agriculture in the 
fertile deltas of great rivers, more particularly in Egypt 
and Babylonia. Everywhere else primitive agriculture ex- 
hausts the soil and compels frequent migrations, but this
-P-A-G-E-338
  332 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
was not the case in the deltas. Here the surplus food pro- 
duced by one man’s needs was sufficient to make possible 
the creation of a small leisure class, and it was this small 
leisure class that invented writing, architecture, mathe- 
matics, astronomy, and other arts essential to all subse- 
quent civilization. Although the class that could share 
in civilized pursuits increased with the improvement of 
agriculture and the growth of commerce, it remained un- 
avoidably small, because labor was still not sufficiently 
productive to create the necessaries of life except by the 
whole work of most of the community. Now, though the 
arts and sciences remain a prerogative of the few, there is 
no good reason why this should be the case; it would be 
possible for every man and woman to have as great a share 
of them as he or she might desire. If every man and 
woman worked for four hours a day at necessary work, 
we could all have enough; and the leisure remaining after 
four hours’ work is amply sufficient for even the most in- 
tensive cultivation of science or art. This fact has de- 
stroyed the only strong argument that ever existed for an 
oligarchic organization of society, whether economic or 
political, and has made it almost inevitable that, if in- 
dustrialism continues without disaster, its ultimate form 
must be socialism, which alone avoids inequalities for 
which the former reason no longer exists. 
The desire to diffuse civilization has, it is true, played 
only a very small part hitherto in the development of in- 
dustrialism, and it is perhaps hardly to be hoped that it 
will play a great part until after the establishment of so- 
cialism. There has, however, been a very considerable 
diffusion of civilization in industrial countries, owing to 
the operation of motives that were mainly economic. A 
man who has some education is a more efficient worker 
than one who can neither read nor write; hence all indus- 
trial countries have adopted universal compulsory educa-
-P-A-G-E-339
BERTRAND RUSSELL 333 
tion. This would scarcely have been possible without in- 
dustrialism, since the time of teachers and pupils could not 
easily have been spared from more immediately necessary 
work. With the coming of industrialism and the compli- 
cated processes that it introduces, universal education be- 
comes both more possible and more obviously necessary; 
increase of education may therefore be taken as one of the 
inherent tendencies of industrialism. 
With universal education come other things of great 
importance. ‘The first of these is political democracy, 
which is scarcely possible where the working class is un- 
educated, and scarcely avoidable where it is educated. By 
democracy, I do not necessarily mean a parliamentary 
régime; the soviet system, as originally conceived, would _ 
have been quite compatible with democracy. What I 
mean by democracy is a system under which all ordinary 
men and women participate equally in fundamental polit- 
ical power, though exceptional people may be excluded for 
special reasons, such as endeavoring to upset by force the 
government desired by the majority. Interpreted in this 
wide sense, political democracy seems to be the system of 
government natural to an advanced industrial community, 
except in times of special stress, such as revolution or war. 
Industrialism, as we have seen, diminishes the freedom 
of the individual in relation to the community, but increases 
the freedom of the community in relation to nature. That 
is to say, the actions of the individual, at any rate, in the 
economic part of his life, become increasingly controlled 
by the actions of the community, or by some large organi- 
zation such as a trust; but the actions of the community 
become less and less controlled by the primitive necessity 
of keeping alive. Hence individual passions, such as those 
which produce art and romance, tend to die out, while col- 
lective passions, such as those which produce war, sanita- 
tion, and elementary education, are liberated and strength- 
ened. Each of these deserves separate consideration.  
-P-A-G-E-340
    334 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
The decay of individual passions brings with it, first of 
all, a diminution of individuality. In a thoroughly indus- 
trialized community, such as the United States, there is 
little appreciable difference between one person and an- 
other; eccentricity is hated, and every man and woman en- 
deavors to be as like his or her neighbors as possible. Their 
clothes, their houses, their household utensils, are all pro- 
duced to standard pattern by the million, without any of 
those individual differences that characterize the products 
of handicrafts. And it seems that the men and women 
wish to assimilate themselves to the articles they use by 
forcing upon themselves the sameness of manufactured 
articles, as though the Creator himself had adopted indus- 
trial methods and were producing men and women whole- 
sale with the very latest machinery warranted to make 
each specimen up to sample. 
In such an atmosphere, art and romance and individual 
affection cannot flourish, since they involve preservation of 
individuality in oneself and recognition of it in others. 
There are other reasons, also, why such things decay under 
industrialism as it has been practiced hitherto, but there 
is one point connected with the decay of romance that be- 
longs to our present topic. The instinct for romance when 
it is denied an outlet in one’s own life, seeks, as instincts 
will, a vicarious satisfaction in imagination. Hence the 
passion for sensational stories, melodramas, and murder 
cases. A lunatic who kills his wife with every circumstance 
of horror is a public benefactor: into a thousand tame and 
listless lives he introduces the imaginative satisfaction of 
fierce passion. Every detail in the newspapers is eagerly 
devoured by men who dare not, in their own conduct, de- 
part a hair’s-breadth from respectable rectitude, for fear of 
losing their jobs. At the outbreak of war the delights 
of many of those who expect to be noncombatants has the 
same source; the gladiatorial show relieves the deadly
-P-A-G-E-341
BERTRAND RUSSELL 835 
monotony of the office or the factory even better than 
a foot-ball match or a horse-race. And in spite of all 
knowledge to the contrary, noncombatants persist in 
imagining modern war on the Homeric pattern, as an affair 
of individual bravery and initiative; for the dreary mech- 
anistic mass-action that constitutes the actual operations 
affords no outlet to the starved instinct for individual 
romance. ‘This same boredom and desire for excitement 
does much to increase the fierceness of revolutionary move- 
ments and to produce the preference for revolution as 
against more gradual and less sensational methods. 
One of the most important effects of industrialism is the 
break-up of the family resulting from the employment of 
women. The employment of women has two effects: on 
the one hand, it makes them economically independent of 
men, so that they cease to be subject to husbands; on the 
other hand, it makes it difficult for them to bring up their 
children themselves. The tradition of the monogamic 
family is so strong in all the chief industrial countries that 
the effect of industrialism on the family has taken a long 
time to show itself. Even now it has hardly begun in 
America, where Christianity is still not uncommon; but 
throughout Europe the process of disintegration, which had 
already begun, has been enormously accelerated by the 
war, owing to the ease with which women found employ- 
ment in government offices, in munition works, or on the 
land. Experience has shown that the average woman will 
not submit to the restraints of the old-fashioned marriage 
or remain faithful to one man when she can be economically 
independent. For the moment the restraints and con- 
cealments imposed by the upholders of traditional morality 
have somewhat obscured the extent of the change thus 
brought about. But the change will grow greater with 
time since it belongs to the inherent tendencies of indus- 
trialism. In a pre-industrial community, rich men held 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
336 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
their wives as property, while poor men made them codp- 
erators in their work. Peasant women do much of the 
hard work of agriculture, and working-class women have 
hitherto had their time fully taken up with household work 
and the rearing of children. In this way, whether in town 
or country, the family formed an economic unit. 
But when the woman goes out to industrial work like her 
husband, and the children spend most of their day at school, 
the economic tie between husband and wife is enormously 
weakened. It is probable that with the growth of indus- 
trialism the practice of eating in public eating-houses will 
increase and housework will be reduced to a minimum. 
The children will have first their midday meal, and then 
all meals, at school; thus the peculiar work that has hith- 
erto been done by wives will grow less and less. Under these 
circumstances, marriage, as it has existed since men took to 
agriculture, is likely to come to an end. Women will pre- 
fer to preserve their independence and will not rely upon 
the precarious bounty of an individual man. They will 
share their children with the state rather than with a hus- 
band, not invariably, but in a continually increasing pro- 
portion of instances. I am not concerned to argue whether 
this change is desirable or undesirable; I say only that it 
belongs to the inherent tendencies of industrialism, and 
must be brought about by the continuance of industrial- 
ism unless counteracted by some very potent force. It 
has, of course, the effect, always characteristic of large 
scale industry, of increasing the pressure of the community 
upon the individual. The family has been hitherto a re- 
fuge of privacy, where it was possible to escape from the 
state, and even, to a certain extent, from public opinion. 
A man with unusual tastes or opinions could bring up his 
children with a view to their sharing his peculiarities; but 
this must cease when the state takes over the education of 
children, and, as it must ultimately do, the whole economic 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
BERTRAND RUSSELL 337 
burden of their maintenance. Thus the break-up of the 
family must increase the tendency of uniformity through- 
out the population, and weaken all those individual traits 
which cannot grow or flourish in a life lived wholly in pub- 
lic. * 
Religion, in its traditional form, appears to be difficult 
to combine with industrialism, although it is by no means 
obvious why this should be the case. Of course, the suc- 
cessful capitalists remain religious, partly because they 
have every reason to thank God for their blessings, and 
partly because religion is a conservative force, tending to 
repress the rebelliousness of wage-earners. But industrial 
wage-earners everywhere tend to lose their religious be- 
liefs. I think this is partly for the merely accidental rea- 
son that the teachers of religion derive their incomes either 
from endowments or from the bounty of the rich, and there- 
fore often take the side of the rich and represent religion 
itself as being on this side. But this cannot be the sole 
reason, since, if it were, wage-earners would invent demo- 
cratic variants of the traditional religion, as was done by 
the English independents in the seventeenth century and 
by the peasants who revolted against agrarian oppression 
in the Middle Ages and in the time of Luther. It is singu- 
larly easy to adapt Christianity to the needs of the poor, 
since it is only necessary to revert to the teachings of 
Christ. Yet that is not the course that industrial popula- 
tions take; on the contrary, they tend everywhere to athe- 
ism and materialism. Their rebellion against traditional 
religion must, therefore, have some deeper cause than the 
mere accidents of present-day politics. 
The chief reason is, I believe, that the welfare of indus- 
trial wage-earners is more dependent upon human agency 
and less upon natural causes than is the case with people 
whose manner of life is more primitive. People who depend 
upon the weather are always apt to be religious, because
-P-A-G-E-344
338 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
the weather is capricious and non-human and is therefore 
regarded as of divine origin. On the rock-bound coast of 
Brittany, where Atlantic storms make seafaring a constant 
and imminent peril, the fishermen are more religious than 
any other population of Europe: churches crowd the coast, 
particularly its most dangerous portions, while every head- 
land has its Calvary, with the lofty crucifix so placed as to 
be visible many miles out to sea. While the fisherman 
is at sea, he and his wife pray for his safe return; as soon as 
he lands, his relief finds expression in drunkenness. A life 
of this kind, exposed constantly to non-human dangers, is 
the most favorable to traditional religion. Indeed, the 
whole of traditional religion may be regarded as an attempt 
to mitigate the terror inspired by destructive natural forces. 
Sir J. G. Frazer, in his “Golden Bough,” has shown 
that most of the elements in Christianity are derived from 
worship of the spirit of vegetation, the religion invented in 
the infancy of agriculture to insure the fertility of the soil. 
Harvest Thanskgiving, prayers for rain or fair weather, 
and so on, illustrate what has been really vital in religion. 
To the peasant, fertility and famine are sent by God and 
religious rites exist to secure the one and avert the other. 
The industrial worker is not dependent upon the weather 
or the seasons, except in a very minor degree. The causes 
which make his prosperity or misfortune seem to him, in 
the main, to be purely human and easily ascertainable. It 
is true that natural causes affect him, but they are not such 
as we are accustomed to attribute to supernatural agency. 
God may send rain in answer to prayer, because the need 
of rain was felt while religion was still young and creative. 
But although a population may be ruined by the exhaus- 
tion of its coal-fields, no one supposes that God would 
create new seams however earnestly the miners were to 
pray. Petroleum may bring prosperity, but if Moses had 
brought petroleum out«of the rock instead of water, we
-P-A-G-E-345
  
BERTRAND RUSSELL 339 
should have regarded the occurrence as a fact of geology, 
not as a miracle. The fact is that religion is no longer 
sufficiently vital to take hold of anything new; it was 
formed long ago to suit certain ancient needs, and has sub- 
sisted by the force of tradition, but is no longer able to as- 
similate anything that cannot be viewed traditionally. 
Hence the alteration of daily habits and interests result- 
ing from industrialism has proved fatal to the religious 
outlook, which has grown dim even among those who have 
not explicitly rejected it. This is, I believe, the funda- 
mental reason for the decay of religion in modern commun- 
ities. The lessened vitality of religion, which has made it 
unable to survive new conditions, is in the main attribut- 
able to science. 
There is one other tendency which has hitherto been 
very strong in industrialism, but which, I believe, might 
cease to characterize industry under socialism; I mean the 
tendency to value things for their uses rather than for their 
intrinsic worth. The essence of industrialism, as we saw, 
is an extension of the practice of making tools. In an in- 
dustrial community the great majority of the population 
are not making consumable commodities, but only ma- 
chines and appliances by means of which others can make 
consumable commodities. This leads men to become 
utilitarian rather than artistic, since their product has not 
in itself any direct human value. The man who makes a 
railway is regarded as more important than the man who 
visits his friends by traveling on it, although the purpose 
of the railway is to be traveled on. The man who reads a 
book is thought to be wasting his time, whereas the man 
who makes the paper, the man who sets the type, the man 
who does the binding, and the librarian who catalogues 
it are all regarded as performing valuable functions. The 
journey from means to end is so long, and the distinctive 
merits of industrialism are so exchusively concerned with 2
-P-A-G-E-346
  840 WHERE IS INDUSTRIALISM GOING? 
means, that people lose sight of the end altogether and 
come to think more production the only thing that is of 
importance. Quantity is valued more than quality, and 
mechanism more than its uses. 
This reason, as well as the one previously mentioned, 
accounts for the decay of art and romance under indus- 
trialism. But the utilitarian tendency of industrialized 
thought goes deeper than the decay of art and romance; it 
upsets men’s dreams of a better world, and their whole 
conception of the springs of action. It has come to be 
thought that the important part of a man’s life is the eco- 
nomic part, because this is the part concerned with produc- 
tion and utilities. It is true that, at present, the econontic 
part needs our thought, because it is diseased; just as, when 
a man’s leg is broken, it is temporarily the most important 
part of his body. But when it is healed and he can walk on 
it, he forgets about it. So it ought to be with the economic 
part of life; we ought to be able to use it without having to 
think of it all day long. The bodily needs of all could be 
supplied as a matter of course by means of a few hours of 
daily labor on the part of every man and woman in the 
community. But it should be the remaining hours that 
would be regarded as important — hours that could be de- 
voted to enjoyment or art or study, to affection and wood- 
lands and sunshine in green fields. The mechanistic uto- 
pian is unable to value these things: he sees in his dreams a 
world where goods are produced more and more easily and 
are distributed with impartial justice to workers too tired 
and bored to know how to enjoy them. What men are to 
do with leisure he neither knows nor cares; presumably 
they are to sleep till the time for work comes round again. 
This utilitarianizing of men’s outlook is, I believe, not 
inseparable from industrialism, but due to the fact that its 
growth has been dominated by commercialism and compe- 
tition. A socialistic industry could be the servant, not the
-P-A-G-E-347
BERTRAND RUSSELL $41 
master, of the community; this is one fundamental reason 
for preferring socialism to capitalism. I wish to warn the 
advocates of economic reconstruction against the danger of 
adopting the vices of their opponents by regarding man as 
a tool for producing goods rather than goods as a subordi- 
nate necessity for liberating the non-material side of human 
life. Man’s true life does not consist in the business of fill- 
ing his belly and clothing his body, but in art and thought 
and love, in the creation and contemplation of beauty, and 
in the scientific understanding of the world. If the world 
is to be regenerated, it is in these things, not only in mate- 
rial goods, that all must be enabled to participate.

  THE WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF 
CAPITALISM ! 
HARTLEY WITHERS 
Amonc the many drawbacks that mar the system of private 
ownership of capital, as it has been hitherto developed, an 
obvious blot has already been noted, when it was observed, 
some pages ago, that if only every one had a fair start it 
would be difficult to devise a more stimulating arrange- 
ment for human nature as it is with its instinct for acqui- 
sition and rivalry. Under private ownership of capital this 
fair start has not been given. Capitalism, as now under- 
stood, is usually regarded as dating from about the middle 
of the eighteenth century, when what is called the Indus- 
trial Revolution began. Before then, the tools of industry 
were primitive and cheap, and it was comparatively easy 
for the worker to own his own capital, in the shape of 
tools and raw material. When machinery came and 
brought with it production on a great scale in large facto- 
ries, a great capital was necessary to success, and so the 
worker and his capital were divorced from one another. 
Some individual or body had to be found, prepared to pro- 
vide the necessary equipment, and to hire those who had 
strength and skill to work it. 
In the past, the position of the owner of capital has been 
strong, because capital has been generally, if not always, 
scarce as compared with labour, and, until labour organ- 
ized itself, the bargaining power of the owner of capital 
was greater than that of those who had little or no re- 
sources behind them. This advantage in the hands of the 
1 From The Case for Capitalism. Copyright, 1920, by E. P. Dutton 
and Company. Reprinted by permission of the publishers.
-P-A-G-E-349
  
HARTLEY WITHERS 343 
capitalist, however, is not a necessary part of a capitalistic 
system. Capital without labour and labour without capi- 
tal are under modern conditions equally powerless, and in 
these days labour, with its growing political influence and 
the sympathy of public opinion whenever it can show a real 
grievance, is fully able to take care of itself. Moreover, 
there is no reason why the sharp division between the 
owners of capital and those who work its machinery should 
be maintained. Under an ideal capitalistic system every 
worker would be a capitalist and every capitalist would be 
a worker. And this is an ideal that is quite within the 
bounds of possibility. 
But this is not the only inequality that made the race for 
material success an unfair contest. The owning class not 
only controls the equipment of industry, but also, by its 
greater individual wealth, can give its sons, daughters, and 
dependents a better and longer education and bring them 
up under conditions — in the matter of food, clothing, and 
access to good air — that give them a long start in life’s 
race. Convention and custom increase the inequality. 
Certain jobs and positions are actually reserved for those 
who have had an education that can usually be afforded 
only by the children of the well-to-do. For instance, only 
a boy of exceptional cleverness can rise from a primary 
school to the university degree that is necessary for entry 
into the learned professions. And many other positions, 
though there is no such definite bar, are practically re- 
served by custom and prejudice to those who speak a 
certain kind of English, wear a certain kind of clothes, and 
behave with a certain kind of assurance and confidence; all 
which gifts are only to be acquired at a certain kind of 
school, or in a certain kind of home surroundings. Luck 
or ability sometimes enables exceptional persons to over- 
come these bars. Fleet Street tradition whispers of an un- 
successful plumber who made a great mark as a journalist
-P-A-G-E-350
  344 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
and a great fortune as a newspaper proprietor, but the 
story of his failure as a plumber was probably a slander 
prompted by envy. There is, however, no need to be 
libellous in order to find scores of men who have risen from 
the bottom to the top of the ladder of wealth, beginning life 
with nothing behind them but their wits and their good 
luck and ending it great owners of capital. 
Nevertheless, there the handicap is. The well-to-do, 
under the private ownership of capital, can live, if they 
have enough of it, on the toll that it takes from production 
without doing any work at all, and if they want to work, 
have everything made easy for them in the shape of spe- 
cially reserved posts, and the connections and influence that 
are so great a help in making a start. It must be a very 
great temptation to those who are rich enough to be able to 
idle through life, to do so; and the fact that very few suc- 
cumb to it shows that some sort of activity is a natural 
want of a healthy and normal human being. There has 
been a noticeable change in this respect even within the 
memory of the middle-aged. The graceful idleness which 
used to be thought so gentlemanly is now much less popular 
than it was, and young men of the class that used to go to 
the university as to a social, sporting, and athletic club were 
approaching life from a much more serious point of view 
even before the war. It is curious to note that in America 
the tendency seemed to be in the other direction. There 
opinion was apparently growing in favor of the creation of 
a leisured class which would do something in life besides 
pursuing dollars. A leisured class that uses its leisure to 
do public work that is otherwise done ill or left undone is 
certainly a national asset, but it cannot be denied that under 
the capitalistic system there has existed a class of most 
unamiable folk who lived narrow, selfish lives on wealth 
that they had inherited, grumbled at paying taxes, forget- 
ting that if the Government did not protect them and their
-P-A-G-E-351
  HARTLEY WITHERS 845 
property they would be quite unable to earn a living, and 
seemed to expect the whole world to be managed for their 
convenience and comfort. Most of us have suffered from 
such people, who are apt to gather at such resorts as resi- 
dential hotels. They were generally quite unable to amuse 
themselves, and lived lives of unprofitable boredom, a 
nuisance to themselves and to most people whom they met. 
This handicap of inequality was thus in many cases bad 
for those who enjoyed it. For those who started with it 
against them it must have often been a daunting influence 
if it affected them seriously. But how far did it do so? 
The average man surely aims at being moderately success- 
ful in the conditions under which he starts. One can, in 
these matters, only judge from one’s own experience. To 
myself, born into the circumstances of an ordinary middle- 
class family, it never occurred that I was handicapped by 
the fact that many people were born with much easier 
chances of much greater success. There was a road clearly 
marked out for me. Somehow I had to make a living, and 
the fact that some people were not under that necessity 
was not a thing that influenced me one way or the other in 
approaching the problem. But this may only have been 
because I was thoughtless or unimaginative, and I remem- 
ber when I was at Oxford hearing a very brilliant man of 
my year remark that it made him “feel Socialistic” when he 
was starting off to an early morning lecture and saw other 
men setting out for a day’s hunting. In this case at any 
rate the early recognition of what seemed to be economic 
injustice had no practical effect in checking effort. My old 
friend may have felt Socialistic, but he went off to his 
lecture and did his day’s work, and is now a shining orna- 
ment of the Indian Civil Service. 
But we of the middle class, of course, have no right to 
talk as if we had any real grievance under the capitalist 
system. We had quite as much as was good for us, and
-P-A-G-E-352
846 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
  got an education and tradition that generally stimulated 
us to make fairly good use of the powers with which we 
were born. The question must look very different to those 
who view it when born under conditions of destitution, and 
have imagination enough to see how great are the disad- 
vantages which this accident brings with it. In this case 
it must often happen that despairing apathy is a very real 
clog to effort, and there is small reason to wonder if many 
of those so born not only feel Socialistic, but put much 
energy and bitterness into working for schemes to recon- 
struct society on a new basis. If a new basis of society 
were really going to produce a better life for the community 
as a whole, most of us would sympathize strongly with this 
ambition; but doubt on this point is the reason why this 
book is being written. 
It seems, however, that the inequality only has to be 
lessened in order to modify very greatly its adverse effect 
on those who suffer from it most. In America, Capitalism 
has grown with a vigorous and perhaps ruthless strength, 
unchecked by the many feudal and social restrictions which 
have in this country turned the edge of its power. But 
owing to the circumstances there ruling — the wealth of 
the country and the unlimited power of expansion that its 
undeveloped resources have placed in the hands of its 
citizens — the way from the bottom to the top has been 
more open. The traveller there seemed to find himself in 
a country in which there were no bars between class and 
class. Those at the bottom looked on those farther up as 
people who had gone ahead but might be caught up and 
would be. There was no sense of a heavy handicap. I 
came in contact in a curious way with this cheerful senti- 
ment when in a hotel in Denver in 1911. A Swedish 
chambermaid, when I was leaving, was good enough to say 
that she was sorry I was going because I was “nice and 
clean in my room.” I asked her if she would like to come
-P-A-G-E-353
  
HARTLEY WITHERS 847 
and be a maid in my home in England. She declined, on 
inquiring into possibilities of the position, but added: “I 
tell you what; I won’t come and be a maid in your home, 
but I'll marry some fellow who’ll make a pile, and then I'll 
come and stay with you.” I gave her my card, and I hope 
and fully expect that some day she will arrive, with the 
husband and the pile in her train. 
It thus seems that the drawbacks of inequality are bad 
for a limited number, both of those who are apparently 
benefited by them, and of those to whom they are a handi- 
cap, but that their adverse effect on the latter can be greatly 
reduced, if the inequalities of birth and fortune are not al- 
lowed to be a serious bar to success in life. When we have 
granted all this, we have next to consider what are the ad- 
vantages that the capitalistic system carries with it. In 
the first place, there is the moral advantage involved 
by individual choice and responsibility which make men 
and women of us, while grandmotherly regulations under 
State or Guild monopoly would make us into machines. 
In the second, it is clear that the ordinary man will work 
harder and better if he knows that the result of his work is 
going to be an improvement in his economic position and in 
that of his dependents. For every man to work for all the 
rest just as hard as he will now work for his own hand is an 
ideal to which human nature may some day attain; but we 
have not yet arrived there, and if we try to make things 
better by assuming that we have, we may put back the 
clock of progress by a century or two. The incentive to 
effort that is given by the power of acquisition is at present 
the great driving-force that constantly improves man’s con- 
trol over nature. If we took it away we might find not only 
that the improvement ceased, but that there was a very 
serious decline in the output of any country that tried the 
experiment; and we always have to remember that a coun- 
try’s output is all that it has to live on, apart from the
-P-A-G-E-354
    848 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
accumulations out of past output, which would very soon 
be exhausted. 
From a purely economic point of view, the advantage of 
a reward for effort in proportion to its success seems to be 
overwhelming. It is true that, as things are, success in 
production or organization often comes from forcing very 
questionable goods or services on a stupid and ignorant 
public. But that is the public’s fault for being stupid and 
ignorant, and what is the alternative? Either an equal re- 
ward for everybody — whatever the effort made and what- 
ever the work produced — a system that would, as things 
are, simply mean that an ever-increasing body of sluggards 
would live on an ever-dwindling and more disgusted body of 
workers; or else some new device for a reward in proportion 
to what is called the “social value” of the work done. What 
this social value really means it is hard to say. What is the 
social value of Mr. Charlie Chaplin as compared with a 
coal-heaver? And who is to decide the question? If, as 
seems most likely, it is to be a popularly elected body, their 
election would be a pretty picture of glib promise-makers 
competing for the suffrages of those whose power to help 
themselves out of the general store of wealth they were 
going to decide. If the deciding body is to be composed of 
Government officials, the results, though less obviously 
disgusting, would probably be still more unsatisfactory in 
the end. 
This question of the reward of effort is the most difficult 
problem that one hits one’s head against when one tries to 
grope a practical path through economic theory. If the 
reward is to be in proportion to the market value of the 
work done, inequalities that will have bad effects will cer- 
tainly arise. These bad effects seem on the whole to be 
preferable to the worse effects on the general output, out of 
which we all have to live, that are likely to follow from re- 
warding everybody, not for the work that they do, but for
-P-A-G-E-355
HARTLEY WITHERS 849 
merely having taken the trouble to be born, like the Mar- 
quis in the French farce. The present system can at least 
claim the merit of having worked indifferently well and of 
being obviously capable of improvement, if the community 
will only apply a little more sense to the objects on which 
it spends its money. Under it the value of our work, like 
that of everything else, is what it will fetch — that is, what 
we can get for it out of our fellows. If they are vulgar, 
tasteless, and stupid we can sell them rubbish and grow fat 
on them, if we happen to be greedy rogues. The fact that 
many of them are vulgar, tasteless, and stupid thus gives 
greedy rogues a chance of which they make ready use; and 
so the unpleasant sight is daily seen of greedy rogues bat- 
tening on vulgar stupidity, and so getting for themselves 
all the power and influence that wealth brings with it. 
And then moralists naturally exclaim that there is dreadful 
villainy abroad, and that the laws ought to be made much 
stricter for catching and punishing it; and short-cutting , 
reformers cry out that there is no remedy for such a system 
except its abolition and the substitution of a new way of 
rewarding people which shall not in any way depend on the 
price at which they can sell their work. But surely the true 
remedy, though a terribly slow one, is for the community 
to contain a smaller and smaller number of vulgar, taste- 
less, and stupid people so that it shall grow continually 
more difficult for bad work to get a good price. 
After all, however we may beat about the bush, the value 
of anything that has to be exchanged or sold is, and must be, 
nothing but what we can get for it, whether the thing be 
our own work or some article that we have otherwise ac- 
quired. Economists have obscured the question of value 
by distinguishing between Value in Use and Value in 
Exchange, and otherwise surrounding it with subtleties 
that the ordinary man cannot, and does not want to, under- 
stand. The value of anything that I have to sell is what I
-P-A-G-E-356
  850 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
can get for it, and the value of anything that I want is the 
amount of my work, or of goods that I possess, or of money 
that I will give and the owner of it will accept. When ex- 
pressed in money, value becomes price. 
Many things, such as friendship, are most precious pos- 
sessions but have no value in an economic sense because 
they cannot be bought and sold, and would lose their real 
worth if they could. From the confusion that this fact 
produces, the notion arises that there can be such a thing as 
“inherent” value in an article apart from anybody’s desire 
for it, and thence we easily fall into the fallacy which tells 
us that a thing must be valuable because a certain amount 
of work and energy have been put into it. Work and en- 
ergy may be lavished on the production of something that 
nobody wants, but if there is no demand for it, it will have 
no economic value. 
Economic textbooks tell us that there are goods, such as 
air, which are essential to life and so have incalculable 
“value in use” but are provided by nature to an unlimited 
extent and so have no “value in exchange.” Thereby they 
merely confuse themselves and their readers. Obviously, 
nobody will pay for anything that is given to him free, ex- 
cept perhaps the American millionaire who left his hotel 
because he was not charged enough to enable him to feel 
that he was really “having a good time.” Air, when it is 
supplied by Nature, has no value in an economic sense be- 
cause no one will give anything for it, and to say that it has 
a “value in use” because we should pay all that we have for 
it if it was not there, is only to introduce a quite irrelevant 
confusion into economics, which is ultimately an inquiry 
into the terms on which men produce and exchange goods. 
When and where air is scarce it is paid for. The Central 
London Railway has, to the great benefit of its passengers, 
paid for a system by which its tunnels are supplied with 
air; and sea-side lodging-house-keepers make a handsome 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  
HARTLEY WITHERS 351 
harvest out of Londoners, who come to stay in otherwise 
most unattractive spots in order to breathe sea-air and get 
the London soot out of their lungs. 
Value is merely a question of the extent to which some- 
body wants a thing in relation to the extent to which its 
present owner wants to keep it. It thus depends to a great 
extent on place, since an article that is a drug in the market 
here may be scarce to the point of preciousness somewhere 
else. As was well shown by the answer of the Scotch 
drover when a Londoner remonstrated with him for the 
prices at which he was selling his beasts at a Highland Fair, 
and told him that if he took them to Smithfield he would 
get twice the money for them. “Vera true,” said the Scot; 
“and if I could take Loch Lomond to Hell I should sell it 
for half a croon a glass.” Value, then, is what we can get 
for a thing or what we have to give for it, when we work 
as practically all of us do now, in codperation with our 
fellows, making something or doing something that they 
will pay for and using their payments to us in paying for 
work that they do. If we were self-sufficing and made 
everything that we wanted for ourselves, value would still 
be determined by the same principle, because we should 
still have to decide how much of our work and exertion was 
worth putting into the production of any article that we 
desired. It would still be a question of the degree of desir- 
ability and the amount of effort that we were prepared to 
give in exchange for an object that we wanted. 
If then the value of everything that has to be exchanged 
is the sum of things that we can get for it, how is the basis 
of exchange to be arrived at? Capitalism leaves the ques- 
tion to be decided by competition, so putting the ultimate 
decision concerning the price of any article of common use 
into the hands of the average consumer. The consumer 
cannot, of course, say that he will have an article at a price 
at which it is impossible to produce it. But he can, under
-P-A-G-E-358
  852 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
Capitalism, say that if he cannot have it at a price he will 
take something else instead. “Whoever ultimately fixes 
Prices,” said the New Age of August 14, 1919, “controls 
thereby the distribution of the wealth of the world.” 
Under Capitalism this power is given to the average con- 
sumer, and this is an enormous advantage on the side of 
Capitalism as compared with any other system that. has 
yet been devised. For it means that we have to work to 
satisfy the wishes of our fellows, as expressed in their de- 
mand for goods and services. Their demand may be ill- 
judged and faulty, but it is real and human, and it is the 
expression of individual choice freely exercised. Under 
State Socialism the value of our work — what we could get 
for it — would apparently be the reward which Govern- 
ment officials thought fit to award to us. We should be 
working not to please the ordinary human being with all 
his faults and foibles, but to earn the approval of an in- 
spector, whose decision would be based on red-tape rules 
and formulas drawn up and enunciated and annotated in 
offices tenanted by beings who, from the nature of their 
duties, would be more or less out of sympathy with common 
humanity. Under Guild Socialism, as will be seen later, 
every guild would apparently work largely according to the 
fancy of its members; and how they would arrive at a de- 
cision of the value of the work so done — that is at a basis 
on which their products should be exchanged — is one of 
the many problems that the advocates of the system do not 
seem yet to have fairly faced. 
Capitalism leaves the question of the value of work done 
to the buyer, that is to the average consumer. It is thus 
much more truly democratic and in favour of freedom 
than either of the rival systems. Under it nobody can earn 
a penny unless somebody else wants his work. It may be 
thought that the capitalist, or the manager who organizes 
production on the capitalist’s behalf, has the final say as to
-P-A-G-E-359
  HARTLEY WITHERS 853 
what goods shall be produced, and this delusion is at the 
bottom of much of the talk that is heard nowadays about 
the tyranny of capital and of its ruthless decisions about the 
objects to which the labour that it hires is to be devoted. 
But the capitalist and the manager, unless they are contin- 
ually successful in meeting a public demand for the goods 
that they produce or distribute, will very soon be in Queer 
Street. If the capitalist puts his money and the manager 
his organizing power into turning out or turning over goods 
that nobody wants, there will be no interest or profit for 
the former and no salary for the latter. Value under the 
capitalist system thus depends directly on the popular 
voice, and will do so more and more as wealth is better dis- 
tributed, as we hope and are determined to see it. At the 
same time, the tastes of the minority are not neglected, be- 
cause under competition a minority that is large enough to 
express an effective demand will get it satisfied. To make 
the system work really well and only give good rewards to 
good work, it is thus only necessary to train the great mass 
of individuals who make up the popular voice to judge bet- 
ter concerning the things that they want to buy. Thisisa 
long and difficult process, but it works side by side and hand 
in hand with real progress, which can only be got by creat- 
ing a community composed of individuals who are good 
and sound in every sense. No rearrangement or rebuilding 
of systems and institutions will do any good that fails to 
produce good and sound men and women, any more than 
the most cunning cooking-stove will make a good omelette 
out of bad eggs. 
Capitalism then is essentially democratic. State Social- 
ism would hand us over to the regulation of the impervious 
and elusive bureaucrat. Guild Socialism would leave the 
consumer to the tender mercies of producing Guilds. Cap- 
italism puts the real power in the hands of the average con- 
sumer, and so suffers from and rejoices in all the weakness
-P-A-G-E-360
    854 WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH OF CAPITALISM 
and force, all the hopefulness and despair, that are asso- 
ciated with democracy. If democracy wins its battle by 
producing a race of men fit to work it, then its victory will 
cure the worst evils of Capitalism. It will no longer be 
possible for providers of rubbish to make fortunes by selling 
it to fools, or for company promoters and swindlers and 
“sharepushers”’ to found county families out of the gains of 
fraud at the expense of silliness, or for unnecessary middle- 
men to take toll on what we consume because shopkeepers 
do not know their business, or for advertisers to wax fat be- 
cause buyers do not know their wants. But Capitalism as 
it might be, is a subject for a later chapter. At this stage 
of our inquiry it is enough to have shown that by giving 
the work of command to the average consumer it is based 
on democratic principle, and will stand or fall with the 
success or failure of that principle in justifying itself. 
If democracy fails and we go back to Divine Right, not 
of kings, but of bureaucrats or guildsmen, then to those of 
us who believe in freedom it will not bea matter of great - 
moment under what economic system we have to live.
-P-A-G-E-361
THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE! 
FRANK A. TAUSSIG 
Tue main argument in favor of free trade between nations 
has been already indicated. It is a simple corollary from 
the principles of the division of labor. Exchange between 
individuals brings the same gain whether they live in the 
same village or in widely separated districts. Things are 
obtained by the exchange more easily and abundantly than 
they could be obtained by each person’s producing for him- 
self. The reasoning which shows that it is advantageous 
for the farmer to deal with the village blacksmith, for Maine 
to deal with Florida, for New England with the Mississippi 
Valley, makes out a strong prima facie case in favor of 
free exchange between the United States and England, 
between France and Germany. The burden of proof may 
be fairly said to rest on those who assert there is gain from 
the contrary policy. 
Most of the common arguments in favor of restrictions 
upon trade, by protective duties or otherwise, are fallacious. 
Many are crudely Mercantilistic, resting on an assumption 
that imports are bad per se and exports good. The so- 
called unfavorable balance of trade is made much of. 
What is expended on imports is deemed so much wasted or 
lost. It is supposed that a decline in imports or an in- 
crease of exports necessarily brings money into the coun- 
try; and the notion persists that herein there is a gain, which 
comes directly from the balance of money secured, not 
through those effects on money incomes and foreign prices 
which were analyzed in the preceding chapter. Few among

-P-A-G-E-362
  356 THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE 
those who speak of a gain in exports as profitable ever heard 
of the last-named process or are able, unprepared, to under- 
stand it. They think of exports as bringing in money, and 
imports as taking money out, and money is the be-all and 
end-all of their economic thinking. Even if it is pointed 
out that a continuing excess of exports is due simply to 
other than merchandise transactions, and does not bring in 
specie, the notion still persists that exports somehow mean 
gain and imports loss. The elementary truth that exports 
are but a means of procuring the imports on easier terms 
than the same goods could be got by making them at 
home — this is rarely grasped, or, if once grasped, is soon 
let slip. 
Mercantilist notions, universally discarded though they 
are by the well-informed, affect the policy of nations, not 
only by strengthening the movement toward protection, 
but in other ways also. The public railways of Prussia and 
of other German states make special rates for exported 
goods, on the theory that this sort of movement deserves 
especially to be fostered. Shipping subsidies are granted 
by many countries, and colonies acquired and maintained 
at great expense, with the same object in view. The Uni- 
ted States government spends considerable sums in gather- 
ing information about opportunities for export, and in pro- 
moting otherwise the export market; while various semi- 
public agencies and museums codperate for this supposedly 
praiseworthy object. Underlying almost all activity of 
this sort is the persistent belief that there is something 
peculiarly profitable in international trade, and that the 
profit appears in the sale of the exports — a belief which 
exaggerates the importance of the trade, and misconceives 
the nature of the real gain from it. 
Perhaps the ancient association of foreigner with enemy 
still lingers. People do not worry when New England buys 
coal from Pennsylvania; but when coal is bought from
-P-A-G-E-363
  FRANK A. TAUSSIG 857 
Nova Scotia, dire consequences are supposed to ensue. 
Half a century ago (more or less) the region which is now 
British Columbia was claimed by the United States to be 
part of its territory. Had the Oregon question been settled 
at that time in accord with the American claims, no one 
would have questioned that the resources of British Colum- 
bia in lumber, coal, and fisheries were of advantage to Amer- 
icans. But once a border line is drawn, the situation is 
supposed to change; and that which would have brought 
us gain in the way of more abundant and cheaper supplies 
is fraught with peril precisely because these supplies came 
from a foreigner. 
Some of the popular arguments in favor of protection 
call for brief consideration; for example, that it creates a 
home market; that it makes employment; and that it raises 
wages or keeps them high. 
When imports are checked, and the things previously 
imported are made at home, a home market is supposed to 
be created. It is created; but there is not, as protection- 
ists commonly state or imply, an additional market. An- 
other and different market is substituted. Here again 
most people’s ideas do not get beyond the range of sales 
and of money dealings. When the linen manufacture (say) 
is established, those engaged in it buy food and other sup- 
plies; and here, it is supposed, is an additional market for 
food. The real “market” — that is, the real exchange — 
is of food for linens. That same market existed when lin- 
ens were imported, and food or other things were exported 
in payment. To cut off imports means to cut off exports 
also; it means simply the substitution of exchange within the 
country for exchange between countries. The real ques- 
tion is whether for a given quantity of food (i.e., of labor 
exerted in producing that quantity) more linen is got in 
one way than in the other. The very fact that linen can be 
got cheaper by importation shows prima facie that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  358 THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE 
foreign market is better than the domestic market. The 
home market argument is most frequently used in the Uni- 
ted States with reference to the farmers, who are supposed 
to get benefit from a greater demand for their products 
because of the establishment of manufactures. The pre- 
sumption is, however, that they do no gain, but lose; the 
“market” which is created offers less in exchange for their 
products than does the foreign market. 
A special form of the home market argument, also much 
used in the United States, is suggested by the truck farm. 
Suppose a manufacturing town is established in consequence 
of protection; the nearby farmers profit by the sale of milk, 
vegetables, and the like. These farmers do in fact profit, 
but simply because, while they sell all their produce in the 
town, they purchase a very small share, if any, of the par- 
ticular things which are made in it. If they had previously 
exported all their vegetables and dairy products, and if the 
manufacturing town, after the duty supplied precisely the 
goods which they had previously procured by importation, 
they would lose, not gain. The truck farmers, in truth, are 
ordinarily within the limited circle of real beneficiaries 
from protection. They gain, however, not as farmers, but 
as landowners. They are like the lucky holder of urban 
sites in a newly established town. The great mass of farm- 
ers do not gain, but lose — those who supply most of 
the needs of the manufacturing population and who buy 
most of its products. The non-landholding people of the 
manufacturing town also fail to gain. As will appear more 
fully in the sequel, neither employers nor workmen are, un- 
der conditions of free competition, permanently better off. 
Only those gain in the end whose sites, whether agricultural 
or urban, are more advantageously situated under the new 
distribution of the population. 
Closely connected with the home market argument is 
that in regard toemployment. That protective duties add
-P-A-G-E-365
FRANK A. TAUSSIG 359 
to the demand for labor seems patent to the everyday man, 
and especially to the workingman. When imports are 
kept out, is it not clear that more employment exists for 
the workmen who make at home the things formerly im- 
ported? Here, again, people see only the first and most 
obvious results, and do not stop to think what other results 
must follow. If there are less imports, there will be less 
exports; and labor, if employed more in the new way, is 
employed less in the old. One of the most persistent of 
economic errors is the notion that employment is an end, 
not a means; and one of the hardest things to fasten in the 
average person’s thinking is that the end to which employ- 
ment should be directed is the increase of the national in- 
come — the total flow of consumable goods and of services 
which constitutes the real revenue of the community. 
Most workingmen, for reasons which are stated elsewhere, 
oppose labor-saving appliances, and welcome arrange- 
ments which seem to increase the demand for labor. Most 
of them are instinctively protectionists, since the same fal- 
lacies are current in arguments for protection as in argu- 
ments for increasing the employment of labor. The work- 
men of any one group or set are concerned solely with their * 
own share of the national income. Anything which adds, 
or seems to add, to the demand for their particular kind of 
labor is of course welcomed; and then, by an easy transition 
from the particular to the general, it is inferred that all 
labor is more in demand because of the circumstances 
which increase the demand in this particular direction. 
One form of the creating-employment argument is that 
there is always unemployed labor and always unemployed 
capital. Put on a duty, bring this labor and capital to- 
gether for making an article previously imported — and is 
there not a gain? Obviously, the same question could be 
asked if the labor and capital were brought together in 
making an article previously exported — is there not (on  
-P-A-G-E-366
  360 THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE 
protectionist principles of the mercantile kind) even a 
greater gain? The truth is, that this problem is far re- 
moved from the protective controversy. Unemployed 
labor is a grave social evil; unemployed capital is a real 
waste. Some proportion of unemployment, no doubt, is 
inevitable both for labor and for capital; it results from 
progress in industry, from shifts between occupations, from 
the processes of change and transition. To minimize it is 
among the most important of public tasks. It is also 
among the most difficult. There is no ground for suppos- 
ing that a system of protection would affect it one way or 
the other. 
If a new industry is stimulated in a country by a protec- 
tive duty, it by no means follows that the labor which is 
unemployed is adapted to that particular industry, or is ina 
place where it can take advantage of the new opportu- 
nities. It takes time for adaptation and removal. Given 
time, however, all the forces of spontaneous activity tend 
to bring together unemployed labor and unemployed capi- 
talin any case. And even supposing the wildly improbable 
outcome that the unemployed forces were really brought 
together in an industry created by protection — the solu- 
tion of the problem would be but temporary. Inventions 
and improvements, redistribution of industries and of 
population, crises with all their dislocating effects, would 
ere long cause the problem to present itself again. A 
country quite without international trade, shut within its 
own borders, would be confronted with unemployment, as 
with other ills, so long as its industry rested on private 
property, complex division of labor, free movement of 
labor and capital, hopes, fears, and mistakes in the busi- 
ness world. 
In the United States, by far the most common and most 
effective argument in favor of protection is that it makes 
wages high, or enables wages to be high. With many per-
-P-A-G-E-367
  FRANK A. TAUSSIG 361 
sons it is an accepted article of faith that American wages 
can be kept high, and the American standard of living can 
be maintained, only if there is protection against the goods 
made by the cheaper labor of other countries. Yet I con- 
ceive that no argument in favor of protection is more falla- 
cious than that of pauper-labor competition. 
Evidently the argument is not of universal application. 
How could there be any exports at all, if lower wages al- 
ways gave the foreigner an advantage? As much is ex- 
ported (virtually as much) as is imported. The exported 
goods are made by laborers who get high wages in the 
United States; yet these goods, so far from being undersold 
in foreign countries, are themselves underselling those of 
the foreigners. The explanation is simple; the efficiency of 
labor in the exporting industries is great and therefore high 
wages and low prices coexist. And that effectiveness is the 
cause of the high money wages; and these wages, again, 
may or may not be accompanied by high prices of the do- 
mestic commodities which are outside the realm of inter- 
national trade. This whole subject cannot be understood 
except in connection with the principle of comparative 
costs. In those industries in which the United States has a 
comparative advantage in effectiveness, high wages can be 
paid, and yet low prices accepted, with profit to the em- 
ploying capitalists. In those in which there is no such ad- 
vantage, the current high wages cannot be afforded. In 
this latter class, though labor be as effective as in compet- 
ing foreign countries, and though the industries in that 
sense are well adapted to the country, they encounter the 
difficulty that other industries are still better adapted, 
yield still larger returns, and set up a prevalent high rate 
of wages which these less advantageous industries cannot 
sustain. 
Of course it is true that, when once industries which pos- 
sess no sufficient advantage have been established under 
the shelter of protective duties, high wages can be main-
-P-A-G-E-368
  362 THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE 
tained, in those industries, only by the continuance of the 
duties. This sort of situation — the existence of indus- 
tries dependent on duties — was historically the occasion 
of the protectionist argument about wages. Wages have 
always been higher in the United States than in other 
countries. Before a protective system was adopted, it 
would have been absurd to say that they were due to any 
such system. When new industries are called into exist- 
ence by protection, they must, of course, in order to se- 
cure their workmen, pay the same wages as are generally 
prevalent; and once they are established, it can be main- 
tained with reason that high wages to their workmen are 
dependent on protection. As long as the workmen remain 
in those industries, the high wages they receive are so 
dependent. 
The free trader argues that if the duties were given up 
and the protected industries pushed out of the field by 
foreign competitors, the workmen engaged in them would 
find no less well-paid employment elsewhere. Presumably 
they would betake themselves to the exporting industries, 
in which labor is advantageously applied. The protec- 
tionist answers that there would then be ‘‘overproduction” 
in those industries — that more goods would be produced, 
prices would be lower, and then wages lower. No, replies 
the free trader — there would be more goods, but not lower 
prices or lower wages. For there is a new demand for 
these exportable goods, pari passu with the new supply. 
Goods are imported which were formerly made by pro- 
tected industries. The new exports must be paid for by 
imports; there is a new foreign “market,” replacing the 
last domestic “market.” The eventual result, says the 
free trader, is that more workmen will be turned to the ad- 
vantageous industries, and more goods will be exported in 
exchange for more imports; there will be higher wages (in 
terms of commodities) all around within the country, re- 
sulting from the more productive direction of its labor.

SHALL OUR COAL MINES BE 
NATIONALIZED? ! 
JOHN SPARGO 
As a socialist, during many years I advocated nationaliza- 
tion of all mines and their control and administration by 
the government, with some sort of arrangement for actual 
management by a body representative of workers, consum- 
ers and government. I have opposed syndicalism and its 
variants, including guild socialism, because, in the last 
analysis, they all placed a dangerous power, the control of 
a great basic industry, in the hands of a group or class, and 
thereby enabled that group or class through that control, to 
dominate the life of the nation. It has been my belief, an 
important part of my faith, that a machinery could be de- 
veloped which would make it possible to obviate this evil 
and to attain essential industrial democracy. That this 
result would not, and could not, flow from mechanical 
arrangements alone, but involved great spiritual advances, 
the attainment of a collective consciousness, and conscien- 
tiousness, seemed to be obvious enough. 
Ihave to admit that my belief in all forms of nationaliza- 
tion has been so strained that it has become a tenuous 
thing at best. The collectivism of the war and post-war 
periods has forced me to admit great disillusionment, to say 
the least. Wherever one turns for examples, the exten- 
sive experiments with nationalization, the substitution of 
governmental for private or quasi-private capitalist enter- 
prise, show no results which can be regarded as encouraging 
or assuring. Everywhere one sees inefficiency, waste, re-

trogression. Our own experiences with the railways was 
not entirely typical; it was an episode of brief duration, and 
throughout there remained in force limitations which 
would not have endured as part of a permanent policy and 
the like of which are not found in the more extended experi- 
ments of European nations. The limitations referred to 
operated as protective devices; they limited the amount of 
harm to our transportation system and to our economic 
life which the experiment could produce. Making every 
possible allowance for the circumstances in which that ex- 
periment took place, I am bound to believe that the sum 
of the results attained can only be regarded as a warning 
against further adventures in the same direction. Govern- 
ment operation of the railways was characterized by in- 
credible ineptitude, by failure to make the most elementary 
provision for the continuous development of the transpor- 
tation system, and by the most wanton disregard of the 
larger social interests when immediate political expediency 
called for the sacrifice of these. 
We saw nationalization at its worst in Europe. Long be- 
fore the war there was serious questioning of the claims 
made for nationalization by its advocates. Government 
ownership and operation seemed to retard development 
progress. It seemed also to be inseparable from a formid- 
able mass of “red tape.” Somehow the institution of a 
frank and candid comparison of governmental enterprise 
with the most advanced capitalistic enterprise in the same 
country invariably showed that in the latter the introduc- 
tion of new methods, the elimination of old abuses, and, in 
general, the constant realignment of the industry of busi- 
ness to correspond with human necessity was much easier 
than in the former. 
But perhaps the post-war period has provided the better 
test. In country after country an unprecedented amount 
of nationalization of industrial enterprise was developed
-P-A-G-E-371
  
JOHN SPARGO 365 
during the war, and of course inherited by the post-war 
governments. It will be freely admitted, I dare say, that 
the great incentives of humanity and patriotism have ex- 
isted in this period to a far greater extent than in normal 
times. The economic structure of every nation has been 
strained; in not a few instances the national existence has 
been seriously menaced; millions have been reduced to 
poverty and destitution, and famine has stalked through 
the streets. If in such conditions public service is not 
thoroughly infused with humanitarian and patriotic zeal 
and governmental agencies cannot be made to give maxi- 
mum returns — if, especially, governmental enterprise 
manifests the evils of bureaucracy, group action against 
the common weal or at the common expense and less 
efficiency than private enterprise, then judgment must be 
rendered against it, quite regardless of alluring theoretical 
defenses. 
Despite the religious fervor of communism and the fact 
that the peril of the nation was so great, if we are to believe 
the testimony of the leaders of the soviet government of 
Russia, governmental enterprise in that country has been 
characterized by malingering, corruption, grafting, nepo- 
tism, group conspiracy against the public, to an extent 
that is almost incredible. When all possible allowance is 
made for the incompetence manifested upon every hand — 
which was natural and inevitable in the circumstances — 
it remains the fact that the other evils above enumerated 
point to the moral weakness of government ownership — 
- unless and until the citizenry itself has attained a high de- 
gree of socialization, both in its thinking and its conduct. 
Why expect the stream to rise higher than its source? If 
government ownership of railways cannot be kept free 
from corruption from malingering, and from wastefulness 
when the officials are spurred by the thought that the 
actual existence of the state is at stake, what hope can we 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
366 SHALL OUR COAL MINES BE NATIONALIZED? 
entertain that it would be better in days of fatness and 
opulence? 
In Russia, too, as in every other country where national- 
ization has been tried upon a large scale, an appalling 
amount of bureaucracy has resulted. The same phenom- 
enon is perhaps the most striking of all the phenomena 
encountered by the travellerin Germany. We saw in this 
country during the war how rapidly governmental agencies 
grow, increasing their staffs— and their pay-rolls, of 
course — and how difficult it is to lessen them once they 
have been permitted to develop. I do not doubt for a mo- 
ment that 40 per cent of the employees of our government 
at Washington could be dropped with a proportionate gain 
in efficiency — could be, that is, were it not for the fact 
that politicians fear nothing so much as the bureaucracy 
which at once serves and masters them. 
In view of their experiences, we can hardly wonder that 
nations which have most tried nationalization are least 
enamored of it and are steadily abandoning it. Italy 
begins her economic rehabilitation by abandoning nation- 
alization in favor of capitalistic enterprise within proper 
regulations. Russia, it is hardly necessary to point out, 
is going the same road. So, too, must Germany. 
The tentative scheme of the Nationalization Research 
Committee of the United Mine Workers of America for the 
nationalization of the mines of the country is perhaps as 
good an outline as has yet been presented. Thus far of 
course it is only an outline; details are lacking, and it is 
possible to speak of it only in these general terms. The 
proposal has at least the merit of placing the subject in 
concrete form for careful discussion. I do not find in the 
scheme any safeguard of the public, the average family, 
against oppressive group action by the miners and the poli- 
tical appointees who are to constitute the administrative 
council. Nor do I find in the entire outline as presented
-P-A-G-E-373
  
JOHN SPARGO 367 
on behalf of the United Mine Workers, sponsors of the 
scheme, any suggestion of providing any protective device 
against the rapid and ruinous increase of bureaucracy, the 
horde of useless employees and “‘seat warmers” experience 
teaches us to expect and fear. 
My principal fear, however, and my present objection to 
the scheme are based upon quite different grounds. In my 
judgment, any plan of nationalization — meaning the 
substitution of governmental for private enterprise — runs 
directly counter to the sum of available experience. Un- 
less I misread the signs of the times, the great need of the 
world, the fundamental requisite for economic rehabilita- 
tion, is a vast strengthening of the capitalist system of the 
several countries. This requires a tremendous augmenta- 
tion of private enterprise and the incentives to such enter- 
prise. It requires a great strengthening of faith in the 
security of investments and the opening up of all possible 
channels for investment in productive enterprises. It re- 
quires the development of a vast army of investors in every 
country. The plan of the mine workers’ committee, in its 
essence, is directly opposed psychologically and economi- 
eally to the needs herein outlined. 
I will go further, and say that any great and far-reaching 
experiment of this character should be resisted at this 
time, not so much on account of its merits, as because the 
world is obviously in no state to embark upon such experi- 
ments. We need stabilization and recovery, and these as 
speedily as we can. The economic fabric has been sorely 
strained, almost to the point of entire destruction. Any 
such program as that proposed by the United Mine Work- 
ers would, if serious attempt were made to carry it out 
under present conditions, add a new strain at a most criti- 
cal time. We are told that the purchase of the coal mines 
would involve immediately an expenditure from the public 
funds of $4,500,000,000. My personal guess (it is hardly
-P-A-G-E-374
  868 SHALL OUR COAL MINES BE NATIONALIZED? 
more than that) is that $6,000,000,000 would be nearer the 
mark. And this expenditure is seriously proposed at a 
time when the lessening of public expenditures, the most 
drastic reduction of the budget, is obviously one of the 
prime requisites of sound policy for the nation. But of 
course we should hardly be entered upon the purchase of 
the mines by the government and the governmental direc- 
tion of the mining and distribution of coal when we should 
be forced to recognize the close interrelation of the mining 
industry and railway transportation. This interrelation 
the leaders of the United Mine Workers already see and 
note. They are not advocating nationalization of the rail- 
ways as an essential part of their plan, but it is obvious that 
it will be found to be so. So to the billions required for 
purchase of the mines we must add more billions for the 
purchase of the railways. 
To supplant the customary private initiatives and incen- 
tives and replace them by those of governmental agencies 
over such a large and vitally important part of our economic 
life must of necessity involve a tremendous amount of re- 
adjustment; and’ this cannot be effected without serious 
disturbances. Under the most favorable conditions this 
disturbance would be a serious matter; under prevailing 
conditions it might well be disastrous. Quite apart from 
the question whether our experience with government 
ownership and operation of mines and railways would 
lessen our troubles, is this fundamental question which I 
have barely outlined. 
Under the tentative scheme presented by the committee 
of the mine workers, the President would appoint rather 
more than half of the members of the council of administra- 
tion of the coal mines. The rest would be elected by the 
miners, engineers and so forth. Presumably, the Constitu- 
tion of the United States is to remain in force, and the whole 
would be subject to Congress. It does not seem to be a
-P-A-G-E-375
JOHN SPARGO 369 
wholly groundless fear that this would inevitably bring 
about a dangerous subordination of industry to politics. 
Presidential appointees may be — and almost inevitably 
will be — politicians for a long time to come. And Con- 
gress will continue to be composed of men and women who 
are more intimately familiar with their own political in- 
terests, and far more concerned about them, than with 
fundamental economics and the public interest. Imagine 
this condition arising: Expert survey of the field of the 
industry shows that mining in a certain district should be 
given up as wholly unprofitable; the standard, legalized 
wage cannot be paid, with coal at the standardized price, 
without a deficit, which must be made up by subsidy from 
the general income of the industry — in theory, but more 
likely from tax revenues. There is no advantage in main- 
taining this district as an active mining area. It is there- 
fore proposed to give it up. But there are thousands of 
miners there who are content to go on, leading a partially 
parasitic existence. Can you imagine the miners’ repre- 
sentatives upon the administrative council or the majority 
of the President’s appointees resisting the protest of the 
miners whose jobs are threatened? Can you doubt that 
Congress would be influenced by the “miners’ vote”? 
Can you doubt the resistence to the introduction of de- 
vices and methods which would make it possible for a 
smaller number of men to mine a larger amount of coal by 
every part of this tremendous political machine? 
No, the plan offers no present relief from the evils of the 
existing methods of producing and distributing coal, bad 
as these are. It simply invites us to jump from the pan 
into the fire. It opens the way for an appalling amount of 
wastefulness and extravagance, and for such a vast horde of 
government employees, personally and vitally interested in 
getting from a basic necessity of life upon which we are all 
dependent as much as they can, that its rapid evolution to 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  370 SHALL OUR COAL MINES BE NATIONALIZED? 
the position of a dominant group, or bloc, having a strangle- 
hold upon the national life is as easy to see as it is terrible to 
contemplate. 
At much greater length than I intended, though still in- 
adequately and in the sketchiest manner possible, I have 
outlined my major reasons for opposing the plan of the 
United Mine Workers. It is impossible to ignore the fact 
that such destructive criticism may well be met with the 
inquiry, “Well, what else is there that is more promising?” 
That question I should like to answer in detail, if I pos- 
sessed the requisite detailed knowledge of the industry 
itself. That it can be answered I am confident. 
That there are too many mines is alleged, and appears to 
be a fact. If this is an important cause of irregular em- 
ployment, long periods of idleness and the consequent ne- 
cessity of high tonnage cost for mining, which in turn re- 
acts against the consumer, that is a condition which is 
much more likely to be remedied by the industry itself than 
by any governmental agencies or legislative devices. Any- 
how, that is the first thing to try. Pooling the products of 
unprofitable mines and the products of profitable mines 
may be practicable under private ownership, by means of 
averaging, without injury to anybody, and even with ad- 
vantage all around. But such pooling under government 
auspices is quite another matter and involves the opening 
of the floodgates for a ruinous torrent of waste and corrup- 
tion. The creation of adequate storage-places for domestic 
coal in the neighborhood of our cities, at least for adequate 
reserves, is not an insuperable task for private or municipal 
enterprise, or a combination of both, one would think. A 
zoning system which would do away with needlessly ex- 
sessive haulage by insisting that the products of a given 
territory shall be distributed in the most economical man- 
ner at the nearest, instead of the farthest, points of con- 
sumption could be worked out by competent engineers,
-P-A-G-E-377
JOHN SPARGO 371 
thus greatly lessening, and perhaps doing away with, the 
ancient trouble of car shortage. Incidentally, it would 
greatly lessen transportation charges. Finally, economic 
pressure alone, or economic pressure plus legislation, could 
surely compel the large industrial users of coal, and espe- 
cially the seasonal users of coal, to lay in their supplies, or a 
large percentage of them, before September first, thus regu- 
larizing and standardizing the movement of coal and mak- 
ing continuous operation possible. 
These are but hints of the scope of the investigation that 
the United States Coal Commission which is now at work 
should be expected to make, and of the lines upon which, as 
I believe, it is possible for the industry to be brought out of 
its present admittedly anarchistic state and into a proper 
relation to the public and its needs. 
For the present at least, I am free to say that I can see 
that no hope of anything good or useful to be attained by 
any such extension of power of the government and its 
preponderance over the economic life of the nation has been 
suggested. On the contrary, the sooner we can lessen those 
powers, reduce the size of our government machine and 
its interference with the economic life of the nation, the 
better it will be for all of us.

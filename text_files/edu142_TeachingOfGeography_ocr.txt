PREFACE. 
To all students of geography it is a lamentable 
fact that there is even yet a lack of respect for 
this branch of science. Though we have a ‘‘new 
geography’’ rich and vital in its possibilities to 
contribute to twentieth century education; yet all 
too many teachers are oblivious of the significance 
and value of the subject and, in the schoolroom, 
are rattling the dry bones of fermal statement 
and definition. Their view of the subject, and 
their method of teaching it, restricts its value and 
curtails the interest which it ought to enlist from 
pupils.» The object of this volume is, first of all, 
to present and instill in the minds of teachers 
the true nature of modern geography. Therefore 
Part I is devoted to the ‘‘Nature and Scope of 
Geography.’’ It is hoped that its careful study 
will result in establishing a correct and broad 
view of a subject whose content is rich in edu- 
cative possibilities. 
Part II of the volume is devoted to ‘‘Methods 
of Teaching Geography.’’ It is true that a better 
conception of the subject would, in itself, correct, 
to considerable extent, the old and irrational 
methods of presentation. And yet, the more ex- 
plicit saggestions and directions which are given

in Part II, may be of use to teachers generally in 
teaching children the subject-matter. It may be 
quite proper to state that the general view as 
here held, together with the discussion of method, 
and the ‘‘Practical Suggestions,’’ are the direct 
outgrowth of the author’s years of experience in 
teaching the subject to children and to prospec- 
tive and active teachers. The method suggested 
is thought to be educationally sound in the light 
of present day educational progress. 
Part III is devoted to ‘‘Practical Suggestions.”’ 
Instruction in geography should be concrete and 
real. Through excursions, illustrative materials, 
pictures and current literature, the vitalizing con- 
tact with life may be secured. Hence suggestions 
looking to this end are given. The bibliographies 
at the end of the various chapters will indicate 
the sources from which the author has secured 
inspiration and help. 
The author is especially indebted to Professor 
H. L. Roberts of the Department of Geography 
and Geology, State Normal School, Cape Girar- 
deau, Missouri, for reading and criticising the 
manuscript; and to Professor W. W. Martin, head 
of the Training Department of the same institu- 
tion, for hints and suggestions. 
Acknowledgement for suggestions is made to 
Principal L. L. Everly of the Teachers’ Training 
School of St. Paul; to Professor Thomas Gentle 
of the Training Department, State Normal 
School, Platteville, Wisconsin, for valuable sug- 
gestions and for testing materials and methods

in actual class teaching; and to Professor C. M. 
Sanford, also of the State Normal School, Platte- 
ville, Wisconsin, for valuable assistance. 
Hoping that this volume will meet the needs 
of teachers anxious to do better work in a very 
rich and important subject of elementary educa- 
tion, it is respectfully submitted.

CHAPTER I. 
InrropucTION: THE NaTURE OF GEOGRAPHY. 
’ TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The tendency of modern education; the nature of geography; its 
fitness to contribute. to present day needs. " 
The old conception of geography; the view of geographers of 
today; the relationships of the subject. 
What a comprehensive treatment must take into account; the 
physiographic processes; the value of facts; the higher value 
of relationships. 
Geography deals with relations; how man adjusts himself to the 
earth; conditions under which he succeeds best; earth and 
man. 
The tendency of modern education is to lessen 
the gap that has long existed between school and 
life. To accomplish this aim materials of in- 
struction are receiving careful attention, and 
emphasis is placed on those subjects or phases 
of school work which give promise of useful 
expression in the life of today. The hygiene of the 
country school should convince the pupil of the 
fact that the thorough cleansing of a wound may 
prevent blood-poisoning, and always tends toward

rapid healing. The study of elementary chemistry 
should inform pupils of the danger of typhoid 
fever that attends the use of contaminated drink- 
ing water, and the instruction should put them in 
possession of a few simple tests for detecting its 
impurities. Geography should make farmer boys 
realize the unwisdom of cultivating side-hill slopes 
as surface erosion will soon steal from the field 
the choicest part of the soil. Civilization is be- 
coming more and more complex, and this com- 
plexity multiplies the adjustments of the efficient 
citizen. Life is too strenuous and competition 
too strong to insure success to him who would 
learn in the school of life, or to him whose school 
training has ignored the ‘‘new duties which new 
occasions teach.’’ 
This new educational situation has invited 
new subjects of study, eliminated parts of old 
subjects, while others, time-honored and familiar, 
seem to have been transformed and enriched 
many fold through a better understanding of 
their ability to contribute to present-day needs. 
Viewed in this light, the subject of discussion has 
proved its worth, established its claim to a prom- 
inent place in the curriculum of popular educa- 
tion and won the significant title of the ‘‘new 
geography.’’ 
At the outset a brief survey of the nature of 
geography may be quite in order. 
The field of study with which geography is con- 
cerned is large indeed! Considered in its broad 
sense it touches many of the departments of 
.
-P-A-G-E-21
THE NATURE OF GEOGRAPHY 19 
  human knowledge. It includes the conception of 
the earth in space, which for grandeur is sur- 
passed only by astronomy, a science which treats 
of entire systems of heavenly bodies with indi- 
vidual characteristics and relationships. Mani- 
foldness, then, is a chief characteristic of geog- 
raphy. An_exhaustive_siudy_of the subject_in 
its larger meaning would lead the student into the 
by-paths of many associated sciences, depart- ments—of which are recognized elements of 
geography, and which, taken together, extend this 7 ? 
field_of stu 
As a science, geography may be called funda- 
mental. (It is the meeting place of all the sci- 
ences. Within the envelopes of the earth abide 
every factor and force of physical science in 
either latent or dynamic, stable or unstable con- 
dition; while on the surface of the earth resides 
a world of life, which is comprehended through 
the biological sciences. 
In its truest sense the nature of geography is 
that of relationship. It is not the mere existence 
of towering mountains, wind-swept table-lands 
and fertile valleys that interest us most, but 
rather the reasons or explanations for their 
being; not the unrelated fact that the earth 
abounds with life, but rather the deeper signifi- 
eance of why there is life and why in successive 
regions there flourish ‘‘murmuring pines and 
hemlocks,’’ fields of wheat full and fair, or giant 
cacti in undisputed supremacy. In its newer as- 
pect geography is concerned with multitudes of

  20 
relationships, a comprehension of which is of the» 
highest value to the student. The pleasures of 
travel and the delights in nature study come not 
alike to all. It is to him who can comprehend 
cause and consequence that satisfaction and ap- 
preciation come. 
From the standpoint of inherent interest, 
geography, owing to its influence on life, ranks 
very high. It is concrete and can be studied on 
a broad scale. Having so many points of attack 
there are many opportunities to awaken the in- 
terests of pupils. Its application to life is made 
easily and directly; and pupils respond readily 
with genuine interest because its materials and 
principles are immediately useful. Whether it be 
at the brookside with its features in miniature, in 
field or forest where life responds to local condi- 
tions, in the factory where earth-products are 
transformed, or at the commercial center where 
the world’s goods are exchanged, the interests 
are alike stimulated and the desire for er 
developed. 
Notwithstanding its richness of content, there 
has been in the past a decided lack of apprecia- 
tion of geography. ‘This is due to a meager un- 
derstanding of the subject. Added respect can 
be secured only through a deeper and clearer 
knowledge. The impulse and inspiration which a 
few of our distinguished educators are lending 
to geography at the present time, make the out- 
look much brighter. It is certainly true that the 
subject deserves better teaching to merit so many      
   
     
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE NATURE OF GEOGRAPHY 21 
years of the pupil’s time. Of course the same 
can be said with even added emphasis of some 
other subjects of the curriculum. There is but 
one solution in any case, and that is the economy 
which will result from better teaching. 
Because of indefinite limits and breadth of 
scope, geography may be more difficult to or- 
ganize than some subjects, but it loses none of 
its richness. The fact that geography has been 
considered a composite science may have led some 
to feel that it is subordinate or unnecessary; or, 
that the overlapping of physics, chemistry, geol- 
ogy, astronomy, ete., really covers the ground and 
meets all demands for it. Prof. Davis denies that 
geography is more composite than physics or 
chemistry or physiology. Dr. Harris has also 
taken the same view. It can easily be shown that 
one science cannot be drawn away from its allies 
witheut annihilation. There is no need of tres- 
passing anywhere. The term geography is gain- 
ing in significance. It is a broad, rich and deep 
subject, which has for departments geology, 
physiography, meteorology, astronomy, oceanog- 
raphy, and ontography. Let the teacher who feels 
that geography is a narrow or shallow field, test 
his knowledge in any of the above subjects. If 
he can conduct a good test his respect for this 
department+of science will be increased. He will 
find the subject matter exact, rational, difficult, 
far-reaching, and touching human experience at 
an infinite number of points, and in myriads of 
ways. !
-P-A-G-E-24
  
22 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
Before further diséussion let us consider the 
nature of geography. Any comprehensive treat- 
ment must take into account: 
1. The forces which have made and sculptured 
the earth’s surface. 
2. The present condition of the earth’s sur- 
face, so affected by the atmosphere and by water, 
that it forms a habitat for life. 
3. The relationships, or responses, that obtain 
between the organic and inorganic worlds. 
+ 4. The manifold needs of mankind and the 
uses made of environment — organic, inorganic 
and social—to satisfy these needs. 
The study of the forces and processes by which 
the earth’s surface has been given form leads to 
physiography and geology. To ignore these 
forces in geography is to teach fact without ex- 
planation or significance. The failure of :geog: 
raphy in the past is due to the fact that it has 
been made a mere memory drill on unrelated 
items and isolated facts. Comparatively, the fact 
side has been overdone; the rational side neg- 
lected. When pupils come to see that geography 
is a study of cause and effect, and not a study of 
fact without apparent cause, they will begin to 
have courage and interest. (Lhe teacher’s knowl- 
edge must be broad and accurate. He must cor- 
relate fact and force, and thus put his subject on 
a reasonable basis. The teacher must have a clear 
outline of the earth’s history, and must under-
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE NATURE OF GEOGRAPHY 23. 
stand the great physiographic processes that have 
wrought through the ages, 
The study of the earth as it is has a practical 
value, and the information should be definite and 
exact. But when these facts are learned inde- 
pendently of their antecedent causes, and also 
independently of their consequent effects, one 
must realize that the fact side alone is uninterest- 
ing and insignificant. Geographic facts drawn 
away from these relations appeal only to the 
memory, and their mastery becomes almost wholly 
formal. Shorn of these relations there can be no 
organizing principle, and instead of well-arranged 
categories, we have a multiplicity of items. Geog- 
raphy has been subject to abuse in the past be- 
cause there has been little of organization dis- 
played in its treatment. 
Geography is science only when the units of its 
subject-matter are articulated for a purpose. 
Facts concerning the present crust should be 
studied, not as an end in themselves, but as data 
which explain organic adaptation. Surface, soil, 
temperature and rainfall are to be considered 
individually as conditions and causes, which con- 
trol organic responses. But it is easy, indeed, to 
wander about too much in this field. Matter may 
be interesting but quite irrelevant. The old prac- 
tice of looking up interesting facts concerning 
places is, in the end, of little value. No greater 
sin can be committed than that of sending chil- 
dren to encyclopedias without the careful guid-
-P-A-G-E-26
24 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
  ance of.a teacher who knows what he wants and 
why he wants it. 
Men succeed best when they apply thein ener- 
gies in the direction that nature’s force is exerted. 
Adjustment to inorganic conditions has often 
been tedious and slow, as is shown in the indus- 
trial history of New England; but gradually men 
have discovered the fields in which human en- 
deavor meets with the most generous reward. The 
attention now given to forestry, the improved 
methods of irrigation, the systematic study of 
agriculture, all emphasize the wisdom of a clearer 
understanding of nature and a better adjustment 
to it. 
Geography deals also with the relations which 
exist between earth in a broad sense, and life. 
Higher forms of life can proceed only from a 
modification of conditions, or from the establish- 
“ment of new conditions, secured through a re- 
arrangement of geographical factors. The prob- 
lem of farmer and gardener is to discover the 
best relationship between plants and soil. Pro- 
duction is increased and the period of diminish- 
ing returns set farther in the future, as a result 
of the best adjustment. Geography becomes, 
then, rational knowledge, and mere facts and sta- 
tistics are forced into subordinate positions. The 
prosperity of Kentucky is due largely to the 
raising of fine stock in the famous Blue Grass 
region. But this region exists because in an an- 
cient sea were deposited the calcareous remains 
of marine life, and the weathering of the lime- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
Se 
THE NATURE OF GEOGRAPHY 25 
stone which this deposition formed gave Ken- 
tucky the rich soil of which she is justly proud.., 
And thus the life of the past ages determines the 
prosperity of the present. Quartz sand sorted 
from the till of the receding glacier by swiftly 
flowing waters, and deposited in western Penn- 
sylvania, has made Pittsburg the greatest city in 
the United States for plate glass. Again, a pros- 
perous industry is the result of a wise adjustment 
of human endeavor to natural conditions. 
Throughout the history of the race, man has © 
struggled to discover and to master natural forces 
and to utilize the life of the earth to his advan- 
tage. He is in harmony with his surroundings 
only when he sees the significance of his environ- 
ment and understands the relation which he sus- 
tains toward it. The branch of education which 
touches the universe at the greatest number of 
points must be of the highest value in revealing 
to the individual the true meaning of life. His- 
tory and geography teach us how civilized nations 
‘have adapted manifold materials to their uses, 
and have made the forces of nature assist in their 
preparation—history dealing with time relations 
and geography with place relations. The exten- 
sive mastery and vast utilization of the materials 
and forces of the external world have reacted 
upon man, have multiplied his needs, have neces- 
sitated discovery and invention, in short, have 
evolved enlightened nations, which, in turn, seek 
to gain a better understanding and control of 
their environment. But this adjustment is not

  confined to the physical side of life. Fundament- 
ally, man’s interests are social. Geography deals 
with some of these social relations under the 
heads of commerce, education, religion and goy- 
‘ernment; hence, the aim of these phases of geog- 
raphy is the commercial, intellectual, religious 
and political adjustment.

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The importance of geographical environment; what power man 
has over environment, 
A classification of the factors or controls of environment; a brief 
discussion of each. 
Illustrations of man’s modification of environment; induced defi- 
nitions of control and response; geography a study of con- 
trols and responses. 
The old geography gave little intimation of the 
relationship that exists between controls and re- 
sponses. Arbitrary facts characterized its teach- 
ing. There was little suggestion that the modi- 
fications and distributions of life, and the indus- 
tries and characteristics of peoples, were re- 
sponses to the guidance of surrounding forces, 
or geographic influences. Such a view of geog- 
raphy robs it of its richness and reduces the sub- 
ject from a science to the mere data of relation- 
ship. Life is everywhere conditioned by environ- 
ment. ‘‘Historic events, business transactions, 
and industrial operations all have place rela- 
tions and are subject to conditions embodied in’ 
their physical surroundings. This precludes no

other-element in the setting of the event, for 
there are time relations, legal relations, and sev- 
eral other classes of non-material environmental 
elements, which in the present discussion are 
simply waived the more clearly to see the phys- 
ical stratum,’’ is the statement of George D. 
Hubbard. 
Man can modify his environment, physical and 
social, but he cannot re-create it. So if reservoirs 
or streams are convenient, he can irrigate arid 
lands; if old waterways are discovered, canals are 
quite feasible; if a river current is too weak to 
earry its load and so obstructs commerce, jetties 
are practicable. In the most successful endeavor, 
men must consider well both the favorable and 
unfavorable elements of their environment, and 
finally choose the line of least resistance. Nature 
must favor human undertaking if the highest suc- 
cess is attained. 
In order that beginners may secure somewhat 
of the significance of this topic, and since those 
who are interested may be inconveniently situ- 
ated with reference to libraries, a short discus- 
sion will be given under the following heads: 
Temperature Controls. 
Moisture Controls. 
Soil and Rock Controls. 
Atmospheric Controls. 
Organic Controls. 
Topographic and Barrier Controls. 
Human and Social Controls.

CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS 29 
1. The distribution of plant life, and to a con- 
siderable extent its form, are dependent upon 
temperature. If the temperature falls below the 
freezing point for much of the year, plant life is 
prohibited, and since animals are largely depend- 
ent upon plants for their habitat and food supply, 
terrestrial animal life disappears. The extreme 
tundra regions offer examples of this kind. Life 
in arctic regions is largely aquatic since land 
temperatures fall so low that life becomes extinct. 
The temperature of water, except at or near the 
surface, does not fall to the freezing point. Water 
is, therefore, a medium in which life may exist... 
' According to temperature and the responses 
which follow, land masses naturally break up into 
climatic and life provinces, topics well treated by 
Russell.* That temperature is very important as 
a control over distribution of life is attested by 
Merriam* in the following words: ‘‘It is now 
pretty generally conceded that temperature and 
humidity are the chief factors governing the dis- 
tribution of life, and that temperature is more 
potent than humidity.’’ 
The physical condition and character of peoples 
are to a considerable degree responses to tem- 
perature. The monotonous cold of the arctic 
regions and the blazing heat of the equatorial, 
have deadening effects upon the inhabitants. 
Stature and complexion are changed and mental 
and moral qualities caused to deteriorate. In 
those regions, where there are sudden changes in

temperature and a succession of seasons, man is 
stimulated in many ways, and here we find the 
highest degree of development. Further refer- 
ence to the influence of climate is made in the 
chapter on ‘‘Geography and Life.’’ 
2. The best portions of our country have an 
annual rainfall of 30 to 60 inches, such regions 
being well suited, so far as moisture is concerned, 
to agriculture. Farm crops cannot be produced 
successfully where the annual rainfall is much 
below 20, though the introduction of ‘‘dry farm- 
ing’’ is overcoming to some extent the lack of 
moisture. Where the annual rainfall is: below 10 
the country becomes nearly barren, bunch grass 
and sage brush being common forms of the sparse 
vegetation. In regions of generous rainfall, for- 
ests abound. In Washington, where the annual 
precipitation is from 60 to 100 inches, stand the 
majestic fir forests. Forests gradually disappear 
on approaching arid lands or deserts. In cold or 
arid regions, nature conserves the limited amount 
of moisture by decreasing the evaporation area of 
foliage. Hence the ‘‘needle’’ of conifers is a 
moisture adaptation, as is the total absence of 
leaves in certain desert species. Again, the roots 
of some desert plants attain a length equal to five 
times the height, so eager are they to secure 
moisture. 
Special responses are seen in animals also. 
Schirmer has pointed out that the camel’s hump 
is a reserve from which nourishment is supplied 
during long privation from hunger.
-P-A-G-E-33
CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS 31 
The nomadic habit of oriental people is a re- 
sponse to environment, chiefly to the arid condi- 
tions. Such people are. compelled to go from 
place to place in order to secure pasturage and 
water for their herds, and hence they are alert, 
enduring, and generally intelligent. 
3. The quality of the soil, in conjunction with 
temperature and moisture, determine the distribu- 
tion and character of plant life. Limestone and 
phosphate rocks yield the richest soils. The cot- 
ton industry of the inner lowlands of Alabama is 
a response to its excellent soils from decomposing 
beds of limestone, while the soils of the barren 
Cuesta or ‘‘Chunnenugga,’’ are from resistant 
sandstone, and, as a control, are negative. Popu- 
lation avoids this uninviting belt. Similar to the 
cotton belt is the blue grass region of Kentucky, 
with its meadows, pastures and high-bred stock. 
Soil responses, either positive or negative, can 
be seen anywhere. Wheat responds admirably to 
the lacustral soils of old Lake Agassiz; ‘‘corn is 
king’’ in the drift soils of the prairie plains; and 
longleaf tobacco is the leading crop in the red 
sandstone valley of the Connecticut river. 
Rock is a term that may be applied to all in- 
organic materials and is referred to here because 
mineral resources of many kinds‘are controls of 
industries, growth of cities, construction of roads, 
immigration, and are often subjects of national 
discussion and legislative contention. 
4, Were the atmosphere static it would hardly 
deserve mention as a control, except from the 
«

  32 THE TEACHING OF GKOGRAPHY 
standpoint of its component gases. But the 
atmosphere is always moving, the winds some- 
times attaining a great velocity and frequontly 
shifting in direction, causing extreme changes in 
temperature and rainfall. Winds in themselves 
constitute important controls. Vegetation is often 
severely whipped and sometimes torn from its 
moorings by gales and hurricanes. It is readily 
observed in our northern states that trees, ex- 
posed to the winds, lean to the east, and that the 
longer branches point in the prevailing windward 
direction. In dry areas strong winds drive sand 
and dust before them, often covering vegetation. 
» Forests are buried in encroaching sand dunes, as 
in Dune Park, Indiana. Sea water is sometimes 
driven inland by unusual winds, causing death 
and destruction. The tidal wave catastrophe at 
Galveston, Texas, illustrates the power of the 
wind in causing the sea to invade low coastal 
plains. Soils are sometimes completely removed 
from bed rock by wind action, thereby making life 
impossible. 
5. Not only do the inorganic features and the 
forces which play upon them condition and de- 
termine life, but often life forms react construct- 
ively or destructively upon the organic world 
itself. It may often be that in this sense a re- 
sponse becomes, in turn, a control. There is a 
constant warfare in the realms of plant and ani- 
mal life. ‘‘Though a summer field,’’ says John 
Fiske, ‘‘seems at first to be a scene of unalloyed 
happiness, one has only to delve a little.deeper to
-P-A-G-E-35
CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS 33. 
find it a scene of robbery utterly shameless and 
murder, utterly cruel.’’ Again, since animals feed 
largely upon plants, the plant world has much to 
do in determining the distribution of animals. 
The abundance of fish off the coast of New Eng- 
land is due to the ample food supply—crustaceans 
and mollusks—which in turn thrive upon the lower 
forms of life swept in by the Gulf Stream and 
Labrador Current. The abandonment of the wheat 
industry in some of the western states has done 
much to exterminate the chinch bug. And so ex- 
amples could be multiplied. 
6. Under the head of topographic and barrier 
controls may be classed relief features of all 
kinds — plateaus, mountains, valleys, plains, des- 
erts, gorges, cafions, moraines, water-falls and 
water bodies. Some of the features here enumer- 
ated, as, for example, the plateau, offer no new 
consideration. The greater altitude causes a fall 
in temperature, which in turn precipitates the 
moisture on its more gentle elevations or at the — 
escarpment which forms its margin. Hence ele- 
vation here resolves itself into a temperature 
and a moisture control. It may be also that a 
third component appears, viz., an atmospheric 
control, since the added elevation may permit 
winds to sweep the region with great carrying 
and destructive force. These new conditions, usu- 
ally brought about by an uplift of a portion of 
the rock crust, may have wrought a complete 
transformation from a salubrious and fruitful 
valley or low plain to a cool, dry, and wind-swept
-P-A-G-E-36
  34 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
plateau, for which Tibet will serve as an example. 
For centuries its dry, cold surface has been swept 
by the prevailing westerlies until it has yielded, 
in the form of fine dust, the famous loess soils 
found in the lower valleys of China. Barriers 
in the form of inaccessible mountain ranges and 
large bodies of water are effective controls over 
distribution of life. Wallace has held that not 
only do natural barriers have much to do with the 
distribution of life, but that the origin of new 
species in general is due to changes in geograph- 
ical environment.* 
7. Human and Social Control. No special case 
need be made of human control, since man re- 
sponds to organic environment and acts also as a 
control over it in exactly the same manner as do 
other forms of life. It is a matter more of degree 
and of perfection than of principle. The ability 
to reason gives man added advantages in his 
struggle for existence and supremacy. In pio- 
neer days men sailed up streams until falls were 
reached; here portages were made and camps 
were formed, which in time became cities. It was 
discovered that the swiftly flowing water offered 
advantages for power, so in time mills were built. 
The great flour mills of Minneapolis are located 
at St. Anthony’s Falls, conveniently near the 
wheat fields of the west and at a focal point of 
great commercial lines to the south and east. But 
even here man is responding rather than con- 
* Island Life, and Studies Scientific and Social, Vol. I, Wallace.

CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS 35 
trolling, though the psychic element must be con- 
sidered. Ff 
Man often, however, modifies his inorganic en- 
vironment in a way and to an end that might 
never be wrought by natural forces or physio- 
graphic processes. Instances of this kind are often 
seen in the construction of roads and waterways, 
well illustrated by the Panama project and the 
Drainage Canal of Chicago. But in such cases 
man is guided and controlled by nature to a large 
degree. Had not an old waterway been discov- 
ered, in the latter case, showing that Lake Mich- 
igan once really did discharge its waters south- 
ward into the Illinois river, man probably never 
would have undertaken the great engineering feat 
of constructing a drainage canal. Scholars have 
shown that not only physical attributes of all life 
are responses to organic and inorganic environ- 
ment, but further that the social institutions of 
civilized races are determined, very largely, in 
the same manner. 
From the foregoing the student should have 
reached the conclusion that— 
1. A control is an element of environment that 
exerts a marked influence upon the development 
of a life form. It may prohibit, favor or deter- 
mine the particular trend of life. 
2. <A response is a characteristic of life forms, 
effected through its yielding to the continued in- 
fluence of a control or set of controls. 
In its best sense, then, geography is a study of 
controls and responses. It is a study of life—
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  36 _ THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
men included—as related to environment. Physio- 
graphic features and forces constitute the major 
controls, with organic controls as minors. Says 
W. M. Davis: ‘‘In its present modern phase, 
geography is essentially concerned with the ra- 
tional correlation of the items that fall under its 
two parts: on the one hand, the items of inorganic 
conditions that constitute the physical environ- 
ment of living forms;.on the other hand, the items 
of organic response made by living forms to their 
environment.’’ 
The richest and most significant phase of geog- 
raphy, then, must terminate in this relationship, 
and teachers of the subject must comprehend the 
. importance of treating the subject scientifically. 
SUGGESTIONS AND QUESTIONS. 
1. What is meant by environment? By inorganic environment? 
By organic environment? By social environment? 
2. To what extent is the distribution of plant and animal life due 
to temperature? Why is there little life in polar regions?

cause there is any sudden change in the nature of 
mind activity, but because the subject is such that 
it demands study in several distinct fields, and

development of the child. The phases, together

The writer adds the fifth or ‘Social Phase,” | 
which parallels each of the other phases, as far 
as they differentiate themselves, throughout the 
course. Unlike the phases based upon mental de- 
velopment, it involves the very function of educa- 
tion, the life relationships of the individual to his 
fellows as seen from the viewpoint of the three 
great systems, viz., ‘‘sustaining,’’ ‘‘transporting’’ 
and ‘‘regulating’’* which for our purpose may 
be called the industrial systems. 
I, OBSERVATIONAL GEOGRAPHY. 
Geographical study actually begins when the 
child enters school, though it is not dignified with 
the formal name of geography until the elemen- 
tary book is begun in the fourth year. The intro- 
duction of the formal study is or should be made 
through the study of nature. The object of sys- 
tematic nature study in the lower grades is to 
put the child into full sympathy with his imme- 
diate environment. Advancement to the study of 
geography proper is then in full accord with the 
accepted principles of pedagogy. The child’s 
circle of information is extended, not in a formal 
way, but in a manner that appeals to the child’s 
~“* Small and Vincent: Introduction to Sociology.
-P-A-G-E-42
  
  4O) THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
understanding and establishes a permanent in- 
terest. The child should get his early instruction 
at first hand; later, he will be compelled to trust 
to the observations of others to describe countries 
and conditions too remote for him to visit. Now, 
it is evident that the large part of his information 
must come to him through the medium of books, 
which he must have the ability to interpret. The 
most important result of observational work in 
geography is the establishment of basal ideas, 
concrete and accurate, which are not only to be 
the foundation of his knowledge, but which are 
absolutely necessary to any reasonable conception 
of the earth through the medium of books. <A cul- 
tivated imagination must enable the child to make 
the transition from the phenomena of the carefully 
observed roadside rill, to a conception of the same 
processes when supplied with the energy of a 
Mississippi. Observational geography and nature 
study furnish the rational extension of the child’s 
mental horizon; it furnishes that training in per- 
ception, imagination and memory which a further 
study of the subject demands; and it supplies the 
mind with typical basic ideas which are to aid in 
the interpretation of geographical literature. 
The period of observational geography proper 
does not require the preparation of a set lesson, 
but it does require— 
(a) On the part of the pupil, the activity of sense- 
perception and— 
(b) On the part of the teacher, directive skill in .
-P-A-G-E-43
TS ee te Le Oa Cee ee ee ee yee eS 
PHASES OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 41 
questioning to the end that definite com- © 
prehensible facts be established. 
In the early phases of geography there is no 
differentiation from nature study, and the nature 
lessons of first, second and third grades should 
form an integral part of the course in geography. 
Indeed, observational work should not cease at 
any stated time, but should be carried on through- 
out the school course. But the first three years 
“are especially devoted to observational work be- 
cause sense-perception is active and sense-impres- 
sion necessary to the child’s development; be- 
cause, at this age, being unable to read helpful 
science materials, the child must learn through 
direct contact with nature; and because a world, 
new and wonderful to childhood, is furnishing 
constant stimuli to responsive centers. It is, there- 
fore, the immediate function of school and teacher 
to bring child and nature into advantageous rela- 
tionships so that sense-impressions may be vivid 
and lasting. : 
It often seems that teachers are afraid to attack 
the nature study work for fear they will not do 
the right thing, or that they may not use the right 
method. They should remember that eventually 
the child’s facts of science will be classified, and 
that in his very limited geographical environ- 
ment there is little danger that any lesson taught 
will fail to be of use later; and further that the 
motive—the understanding and appreciation of 
environment—if realized, will justify the means
-P-A-G-E-44

* employed. This being true, teachers should then 
set about their tasks with courage and even bold- 
ness. Their own interests will deepen, and, if 
they are possessed of the teaching spirit, their use 
of books on both method and subject-matter can 
hardly fail to direct them into pedagogical paths. 
Latent interests may often be transformed and 
the possibilities of nature study and geographical 
topics be made clear through the reading of such 
literature as ‘‘The Story of a Salmon,’’ ‘‘The 
Story of a Stone,’’ ‘‘The Ascent of the Matter- 
horn,’’ all by David Starr Jordan, and ‘‘The Des- 
ert,’? by VanDyke. Furthermore, the vast num- 
ber of bulletins and pamphlets published by 
schools, by experiment stations, and by the De- 
partment of Agriculture, will be of great use to | 
teachers generally. 
II. REPRESENTATIVE GEOGRAPHY. 
Representative geography is a form of expres- 
sion through established symbols—of ideas al- 
ready comprehended. But soon it comes to mean 
the interpretation of eee for the purpose of 
securing ideas. 
The observational mre is oral. The pupil 
works. only under immediate guidance of the 
teacher. The time soon comes when the process 
of education demands more expression from the 
child. So far, his geography has been learned 
directly from nature, but soon he must resort to 
books. It is necessary that he then understand 
the use of maps, and the logical procedure seems
-P-A-G-E-45
PHASES OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 43 
to be that of mapping the home district or some 
part of it. Usually the pupil begins by mapping 
his school room. If seats do not face north, the 
pupil should oceupy a chair facing the north, in 
this early study of maps. He now becomes active; 
he must invent for himself. After making the 
map of the school house, the pupil maps the school 
yard, the district or the ward, locating the school, 
his home, the postoffice, or other building or loca- 
tion that touches his interest. The mapping of 
these areas not only makes the child somewhat 
familiar with the idea of scale and the meaning 
of maps, but the accompanying descriptions 
worked out by the child himself react upon his 
observations previously made, making them 
sharper and clearer. yBy use of the sand table, 
the pupil learns to represent plains, slopes, 
divides, hills, and mountains; but this work should 
be a representation of observed phenomena in na- 
ture, and not a reproduction from bookg. Pupils, 
from the start, must be impressed with the fact 
that geography is a study of the earth and not of 
the book. The next step, that of reading a relief 
map, will not be difficult for the child who has 
comprehended the earlier work. Thus he gradu- 
ally comes into the use of symbols; but they 
closely follow concrete ideas. Indeed, the pictur- 
ing of an idea necessitates its disentanglement 
from a mass of information, often not fully organ- 
ized and assimilated, making its lines more dis- 
. tinct, and adding to its Significance. Frequently 
we do not realize how imperfect our notions are 
AY

until we attempt a written description or an illus- 
trative diagram. Two important results should 
follow the activity of this phase of study. It 
should clarify and intensify the basal notions of 
his observation work; and it should introduce the 
child to the use of those symbols which are pre- 
-requisites to the next stage, descriptive geog- 
raphy. t 
III. DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY. | 
During the observational period the pupil is 
largely dependent. He has not yet learned the 
use of the symbols through which he can be inde- 
pendent. Neither does he at this time possess any 
considerable mass of related knowledge. Hay- 
ing come into possession of a reasonable body 
of facts closely related to his own life and in- 
terests, he proceeds in the second stage to adapt 
a set of symbols to this knowledge. His work is 
creative here, but still only partially independent. 
Much guidance is yet required by the teacher. The 
third stage places the pupil still more upon his 
own responsibility. He must now get his ideas 
from books of travel, from gazetteers, from maps, 
charts, ete., always under strict direction of the 
teacher, depending upon imagination and con-. 
structive conception to make these ideas strong. 
and vivid. The tendency of geography in this 
period is to become abstract and to lack reality, a 
tendency which is obviated only by the pupil’s 
exercise of his imagination, and by oral illustra- 
tions, pictures, lantern views and field excursions.
-P-A-G-E-47
PHASES OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 45 
Practice in constructing accurate mental pictures 
which shall accord with the word paintings of oral 
or written description is invaluable. The exercise 
leads to the acquisition of rich and well-defined 
information, and Tree nally secures mental dis- 
cipline. 
Since the average pupil has little opportunity to 
learn of the world at first hand, it soon becomes 
necessary to get ideas and information second 
hand, or through the medium of books. Since 
commercially related countries do much for one 
another, the pupil must learn of other homes than 
his own and of the dependence of his own home 
life upon the home life of far away people. 
Descriptive geography, in general, covers the 
period of the intermediate grades. It is under- 
stood, of course, that there is no line of demarca- 
tion between these phases of geography, and that 
the descriptive phase, for example, will extend 
entirely through the succeeding work. Descriptive 
geography predominates at a time when memory 
and imagination are very active and before the 
time when relationships make the strongest 
appeals to the child-mind. During this phase the 
gathering of data, often of a detailed character, 
occupies much of the pupil’s time. In courses 
based largely upon text-books it constitutes the 
so-called ‘‘first round.’’ Geographical readers, 
books of travel, and selected articles from current 
literature are highly in order, especially if well 
illustrated. 
The various necessaries and luxuries of our

home life offer a natural approach to many topics 
widely enough distributed to lead inductively to a 
general view of the earth as a whole and to con- 
siderable detailed hiowledge of it. 
Iv. RATIONAL GEOGRAPHY. 
The observation of results and the acquirement 
of’ facts lead the child to look for reasons. Ex- 
planations of causal relations should be made at 
all times during the study, when they can be made 
to appeal. But the pupil must not be burdened 
with an explanation which he cannot comprehend. 
The study of rational geography is wisely de- 
ferred until the reason is active; when, as Dr. 
Harris says, the pupil forms the habit of looking 
upon one fact as the explanation of another. The 
child’s whole life has been devoted to the acquire- 
ment of facts; he is now to discover how facts are 
related to one another. It is true that the un- 
trained mind explains one fact by another having 
no relation to it, and therefore his notions of the 
world become distorted and superstitious. The 
rational element of geography is especially prom- 
inent in physiography. The pupil here compares 
and relates the facts of his earlier experience and 
from them deduces general principles. He learns 
to view all of the earth’s materials and natural 
forces as inter-related and adjusted. Through 
industrial geography he learns how civilized men 
have controlled forces and modified materials to 
subserve their needs. 
The introduction of the causal or rational prin-
-P-A-G-E-49
PHASES OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 4v 
ciple into geography is due to Carl Ritter. Later 
scholars have elaborated his notion, which as- 
sumes the form of relationship between environ- 
mental control and organic response. This is 
treated more fully in a succeeding chapter. 
Prof. Dryer recognizes the rational element of 
geography when he defines its function as follows: 
““The business of geography is first to determine 
accurately the distribution of each and all of the 
factors of geography (land, water, air, plants, 
men) and, second, to discover the causes which 
have brought about the distribution of each; and, 
third, to explain the relation of each. factor or 
group of factors to all of the rest.’’ 
Hence cause, relationship and consequence seem 
to merit special emphasis. Says Prof. Davis: 
“Another step of equal importance . . is 
the change from the empirical to the ouplaanione 
or rational or genetic method of treating the ele- 
mental facts that enter into geographical rela- 
tionships.’? Wm. T. Harris puts it this way: 
““Above all, I should wish to call to mind again, 
as the central reason for its place in the curricu- 
lum, the general value of geography in giving the 
pupil an insight into natural causes. In early 
periods of the history of mankind, and among all 
savage peoples that are contemporary with us, 
the facts of nature are explained by animism, that 
is to say, by the interference of evil spirits. A 
vast network of superstition covers the face of 
nature from the gaze of the savage. But the child 
who begins to study geography begins to find one
-P-A-G-E-50
me 48 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
fact behind another fact. He learns forces, and 
how forces make things, and how forces modify 
things. His knowledge constantly grows from 
the symbolic, which ignores the causal nexus, over 
to the scientific and prosaic view, which compre- 
hends the rationale of phenomena.’’ 
Vv. THE SOCIAL PHASE. 
This phase of geography has more often been 
styled ‘‘human’’ geography, but in the light of 
the recent movement in education it seems very 
appropriate to refer to it as the social phase. 
As has already been said, this element pervades 
the whole course of elementary geography. In 
the nature study work, where a whole world of 
things confronts the teacher, his basis for selec- 
‘ tion must be, How will this particular thing, if 
taught the child, function in his life? How will 
this knowledge contribute to his social efficiency? 
In pointing out suitable nature study materials 
Otis W. Caldwell enumerates the following: 
“Nature study materials should also make pos- 
sible a large body of knowledge that is useful in 
the broadest sense of that term—knowledge of 
the domesticated animals, their ways of living, 
their use by man, their histories, the selection and 
care of the best breeds, the regions where differ- 
ent ones thrive best; knowledge of house pets; of 
wild animals, their relation to one another and to 
man; of helpful and injurious insects; knowledge 
of domesticated plants, house plants, vegetables 
and flowering plants and the gardens in which
-P-A-G-E-51
  
PHASES OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY , 49 
they grow, agricultural plants, orchard plants, nut 
and fruit trees_of the woods, lumber and its 
sources and uses, poisonous,. medicinal and fiber 
plants; plants and animals and climatic conditions 
as soil makers; building stone, brick, lime, sand; 
minerals, coal, gas, oil; knowledge of factors 
having to do with public and private health; 
knowledge of physical forces, of simple machines, 
of the applications of electricity; of the trans- 
formations of chemistry and their uses in indus- 
trial and household processes.’? Therefore it is 
knowledge useful in the broadest sense of that 
term; but what does useful mean? Things truly 
useful enable one to live better; and good living 
on the part of one individual presupposes a help- 
fulness that enables others to live better. And 
this consideration of others is always social. Is 
it not easy to discern that, in the above list, all 
of the topics center about better living both of 
self and others? 
In the study of home. geography also, inter- 
dependence is the fundamental idea.. When we 
study the means by which we ourselves and our 
neighbors are fed, sheltered, and clothed, the idea 
of doing for others, of being socially helpful, 
again appeals to us. So butcher, baker, and candle- 
stick-maker, each in his own way, renders some 
social service, but the industry to be geographical 
must relate backward to the earth. 
The whole field of commercial geography in- 
volves the social factor. Commerce is the medium 
by which peoples widely separated assist each

other in living. The sustaining system of the 
English weaver extends to the Dakota farmer who 
raises his wheat; the Minneapolis miller who 
grinds it; the transporting companies which carry 
the flour; and even to the British Parliament, the 
regulating power, which permits the flour to be 
landed duty free in Liverpool. How intimately 
associated, then, are the geographical and the 
social! :

proper approach to the study of geography? 
2. What importance attaches to the idea of expression in educa-

CHAPTER IV. 
THe Revation or GEOGRAPHY TO THE SCIENCES. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Geography a composite science; science necessary to explain rela- 
tionships; specialized science to be avoided. 
Geology the basis of geography; dynamical geology, a study of 
physiographic processes; soils intimately related to life. 
Astronomy; how the sun’s altitude determines temperature. 
Influence of the atmosphere and its movements; how storms and 
sudden weather-changes affect the commercial world. 
How physics and chemistry are involved in geography. 
The biological sciences; the products of animal and plant worlds 
the materials of commerce and manufacture. 
Much of agriculture in geography,.Leading educators quoted. 
Necessity of a knowledge”of science in teaching geography. 
The many-sidedness of geography relates it 
closely to various subjects of the curriculum. It 
is a nucleus at which the elements common to the 
three great groups of science, viz., the physical, 
biological and social, seem to meet. In this sense, 
geography is a field of simple applied science. To 
divorce geography from these science relation- 
ships robs it of its richest content. For these rea- 
sons physiography is conceded to be the best cor- 
relating subject in the secondary group. But only 
such elemental science should enter into general 
geography as is necessary to explain its relation- 
ships. If this principle is adhered to, the danger 
52
-P-A-G-E-55
RELATION TO THE SCIENCES 53 
of drifting into the field of specialized science will 
be avoided. The very nature of the subject de- 
mands a broad sweep of knowledge on the part of 
the teacher, and the chief source of failure in 
geographical instruction is due to a lack of breadth 
in general scholarship. 
Geology, to which physiography belongs as its 
dynamical phase, is the very foundation of geog- 
raphy. It is inconceivable that good instruction 
can be given by one who has not grasped the full 
significance of the ‘‘physiographic processes,’’ 
and the elaboration of‘these processes builds up 
physiography and dynamic geology. There are 
also many minor principles and facts in geology 
that no comprehensive treatment of geography 
can omit. The value of a knowledge of these prin- 
ciples is discussed in the chapter on ‘‘The Teach- 
er’s Preparation.’’ 
The whole subject of rock weathering and soils 
belongs both to geography and geology. Indeed, 
it must be understood that geography is a much 
broader and more significant term than is geology, 
physiography, meteorology, agriculture, ete. So 
closely related are life and soils that-our most 
helpful writers on ‘‘home geography’’ include 
chapters on the formation of soils. 
The change of seasons introduces the pupil to 
astronomical geography. The life zones of the 
earth are very largely dependent upon tempera- 
ture. A study of the sun’s altitude at various 
seasons of the year is legitimate geography when 
studied as a control over the distribution of life;
-P-A-G-E-56
  54 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
it is astronomy when studied as an end in itself. 
Meteorology, as a department of geography, is 
of great importance. Storms, droughts, and sud- 
den changes in temperature affect the whole com- 
mercial world. The daily weather map is the first 
thing to be considered by members of the Board 
of Trade. <A continued strong south wind, by 
checking the outflow of water from Lake Huron, 
often delays the passage of the larger vessels 
through the straits at Detroit. The frequent de- 
struction of crops in the Dakotas by midsummer 
hail storms has led to the organization of in- 
surance companies to protect the producer of 
farm crops. Studied in this light, meteorology 
and geography are one and the same. 5 
Physics and chemistry are so involved with the 
great fields of organic and inorganic nature that 
argument and illustration to show their relation- 
ships to geography seem quite unnecessary. 
“Were it not for the magician chlorophyll con- 
juring with the sunbeams,’’ as John Fiske puts 
it, carbon-dioxide and water could not unite and 
make possible the major portion of the vegetable 
kingdom. Inertia and gravitation keep the earth 
swinging in its orbit, and the whole process of 
gradation and base-leveling is wrought through 
the force of gravity. ! 
The biological sciences are involved in geog- 
raphy largely through the arts and industries, 
which employ animals and plants as the raw ma- 
terials of commerce and manufacture. There are 
few things which civilized man has not utilized  
-P-A-G-E-57
RELATION TO THE SCIENCES 55 
for definite purposes. Much of school geography 
is found under the heads of agriculture, stock- 
raising, fishing, dairying, trucking, lumbering, 
etc., and the multitudes of products from this or- 
ganic side of nature are biological in origin,’ but 
geographical when they direct the industries, dis- 
tribution and welfare of mankind. 
Applied science is today at a premium. The 
great interest in agriculture seems to be an illus- 
tration of this fact. A survey of the contents of 
texts on elementary agriculture reveals the fact 
that the subject matter is found largely in botany, 
zoology, and geography. There is certainly no 
innovation in the study of soils, roots, pollination, 
grafting, bee-culture, the cabbage worm, potato 
beetle, wheat, corn, moisture, and birds, simply 
because these topics are found in a book entitled 
‘‘Agriculture for Beginners.’’ The agricultural 
movement is in keeping with modern pedagogy, 
which maintains that culture and utility are in 
thorough harmony with each other. But it is a 
matter of application and degree rather than 
‘‘newness”’ of the subject-matter. Reference is 
here made to agriculture simply to show that it 
bears a relationship, and a pretty close one, to 
geography. In discussing the correlations of 
geography, Dr. Charles McMurry makes the fol- 
lowing statement: 
“In some of the principal schemes for corre- 
lating studies, geography has been regarded as 
the mother study, the one that would naturally be 
the center in any plan of concentration.
-P-A-G-E-58
  56 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
The natural sciences are usually thought of, not 
only as having many intimate relations to geog- 
raphy, but as actually furnishing a large part of 
the warp and woof of geography. The minerals, 
vegetables, ‘animals, and all the physical objects 
and phenomena of earth, air, and water which 
make up the peculiar realm of natural science 
supply also the subject-matter of geography. 
Geography deals with all these things from a 
peculiar standpoint which we call the geograph- 
ical, but they are the same materials which the 
various natural sciences deal with, each from its 
own point of view.’? And James Bryce, in dis- 
cussing the geographical relationships of geog- 
raphy and science, says in part: 
- All branches of knowledge which have any- 
thing to tell us about the earth more or less hinge 
into or are connected with geography, or you may 
if you like, say they diverge from it as specialized 
departments of that general knowledge which it 
presents in its connection with the whole. For 
instance, geography takes account of the solid 
crust of the earth. ' The solid crust of the earth is 
the special subject of three sciences, geology, 
mineralogy and paleontology, which therefore 
diverge from geography as being specialized 
branches of the science which it presents in 
a general way. Then you have a second divergent 
branch in meteorology and oceanography, dealing 
with the phenomena of the air and vapor and the 
closely cognate phenomena of the great masses of 
condensed vapor which exist on the surface of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  RELATION TO THE SCIENCES 5Y 
earth in the form of oceans. A third branch is 
that represented by the sciences of botany and 
zodlogy, describing the living creatures which find 
their home and their sustenance on the earth. A 
fourth, a little more remote, consists of the sci- 
ences of physies and chemistry, which deal with 
the constituents of the globe and of the forces 
which move them. The forces which you see in . 
operation on the earth belong to the science of 
physics, and the study of the constituent elements 
of the earth, the methods by which they are ana- 
lyzed and the combinations which they form, be-

long to the science of chemistry. Even astronomy, 
although it carries us beyond the limits of our ter- 
restrial globe, is really closely connected with the 
science of the earth, inasmuch.as many terrestrial 
phenomena are sensibly affected by the phenom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  5g | THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
ena which lie beyond the globe, and cannot be un- 
derstood without a comprehension of astronomy. 
“The whole of this great group of physical 
sciences, each of them redivided and specialized 
into numerous branches and departments, springs 
from geography as the center of the group.’’ 
The experienced teacher is well aware of the 
correlations of geography and science. Scarcely 
a lesson but what some necessity arises for the 
explanation of science facts. The most common 
observations occasion discussions, and ‘‘the fos- 
tering of a spirit of inquiry’’ makes explanations 
imperative. In the community is an artesian 
well. The water comes from a depth of 1,800 feet 
and has a temperature of about 70 degrees Fahr. 
It is highly charged with hydrogen- sulphide, and 
emits a disagreeable odor. Gas is seen to rise in 
bubbles and escape from the surface. Iron, too, 
is in solution, and ‘‘rusts’’ containing vessels. 
Here, then, is an opportunity, and a rare one, for 
nature study and geography lessons. Even young 
children will ask why the water gushes out of its 
own accord, why it is so warm, why there are bub- 
bles in it, ete., ete. 
Again, the local coal mine, which figures so 
much in the lives of people, can hardly fail to pro- 
voke questions which lead us back to historical 
geology for satisfactory explanations. Then, too, 
some coal is hard and some is soft. What is hard 
coal, and why does it sometimes burn with a pale 
blue flame and sometimes with a bright red flame? 
Why is soft coal so gassy and smoky as compared 
|  
-P-A-G-E-61
RELATION TO THE SCIENCES 59 
with the hard? etc., ete. A lime kiln may be in the 
vicinity, and an excursion may stimulate inquiry 
as to why the stone must ‘‘be burned,’’ what 
change takes place, where the stone came from, 
etc. Certainly, on every hand science is involved 
with human life and welfare, and much of geog- 
raphy is meaningless unless accompanied with 
scientific explanations. 
Much elementary science can be taught and of 
necessity must be taught in connection with geog- 
raphy. This science must not be considered irrel- 
evant, for it is an integral part of geography. 
Care must always be taken not to go beyond the 
proper limits of geography, and the facts pre- 
sented should explain earth relations, and so be 
of use to the individual in dealing with his phys- 
ical environment. 
To ignore the involved science in the study of 
geography tends to make the subject superficial, 
formal and empirical. If the teacher has a well- 
defined notion of geography, the danger of irrele- 
vance will not be great. On the other hand, the 
added interest and significance which will come 
from an understanding of causal or scientific rela- 
tionships seem to warrant the more thorough , 
treatment which a scientific method requires. 
If one pauses to consider how the facts and 
principles of science enter into the most common 
of life’s experiences, especially those that seem 
to be earth-determined, he will readily admit its 
practical value. The production of a farm crop 
involves a whole round of science that is clearly
-P-A-G-E-62
  60 | THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
geographic. The enterprise first of all makes a 
consideration of climate fundamental. A crop 
must be selected that can mature during the grow- 
ing season and which will thrive on the amount 
of moisture that may be expected. The whole 
problem of climate must at once be reckoned with, — 
and any adequate understanding leads us to con- 
sider the facts of elementary science. Crop pro- 
duction, again, is largely dependent on soils, and 
the quality of soils, in turn, upon the character of 
underlying rocks. But rock-weathering is the re- 
sult of many forces, some physical and some 
chemical, that codperate in the process of soil- 
making. Next must be considered the drainage, 
which makes cultivation possible. Hence, topog- 
raphy plays its part. If the slope is insufficient 
to permit gravity to carry away accumulated 
water, then the farmer must resort to ditching or 
tiling. On the other hand, too great slopes may 
cause rapid dissection of the lands, which the in- 
genious cultivator must check. The soil must be 
sufficiently porous to absorb a goodly amount of 
moisture, and its capillarity must again bring it 
to the rootlets of the growing crop. By experi- 
ment the farmer must determine if his field is 
poor in phosphorus or nitrogen, and the lacking 
plant food must be restored. Careful study and ° 
experiment must determine the best time of plant- 
ing (quite regardless of the moon’s phases), the 
depth at which the seed should be placed, together 
with the character and frequency of cultivation 
which the growing plants seem to demand.
-P-A-G-E-63
RELATION 1'0 THE SCIENCES 61 
And yet this is but the beginning of a homely 
illustration of how the earth and natural forces, 
or science, enter into the life of man. The new 
education attempts to explain such science as 
functions in life, and the new geography is one of 
the media through which education may bring 
much that is practical and vital into the lives of 
those who study its content and comprehend its 
teachings.

the distribution of wealth, culture, and the various 
types of life’’* Geography forms the basis of

history and often determines its trend. Mountains 
and rivers direct the line of march of invading 
armies, and influence, at least, the destiny of bat- 
tles. Ocean currents and prevailing winds guide 
the courses of ships at sea. Mountain passes con- 
dition the settlement of distant Nishi, River val- 
leys indicate the lines of least_resistance for com- 
mercial highways. Industrial centers take advan- 
tage of falling water, and castle and fortress seek 
the eminence of hills. 
Investigators in both history and geography 
have made marked progress in tracing the rela- 
tionships of geography and history. Numerous 
magazine articles have been written, and genuine 
contributions have been made by Albert Perry 
Brigham and Ellen C. Semple. 
The teacher of geography must pave the way 
for the teacher of history, by establishing a sub- 
stantial geographic basis. The geography, too, 
must be made significant through the study of its 
influence on human affairs. The teacher in the 
grade or rural school who conducts the recitations 
in both of these subjects has a fine opportunity to 
develop the relationship, now from the side of 
history, and again from the side of geography. 
As a result of a wise correlation, both of these 
subjects can be much enriched. 
On both large and small scales the influence of 
geography is seen. The writer remembers how, in 
the district school, the pupils were taught to asso- 
ciate industries with cities. ‘‘Lynn was noted for 
the manufacture of ladies’ shoes;’’ ‘‘Bath, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
RELATION TO HISTORY 65 
ship building;’’ ‘‘ Lowell and Lawrence for cotton 
manufacture,’’ ete. No thought ever occurred to 
either teacher or pupils to discover why these in- 
dustries were so distributed. The facts were 
purely empirical. The relationship that is now 
universally recognized between geography and 
history is one of significance, and is doing much 
to break down the old empirical method of instruc- 
tion. So in their own communities, teachers would 
do well to discover as many cases of geographic 
influence as possible, and so to introduce in a con- 
crete way the companionship of history and geog- 
raphy. 
With the many illustrations of those who have 
specialized in this field, it would seem sufficient 
simply to point the way to good books. But one or 
two examples may be permissible. 
I. PHYSIOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRIAL HISTORY IN NEW 
ENGLAND. 
That physiography controls industrial history 
—and often political—can be illustrated in any 
country. An illustration, though too brief to be 
good, may emphasize industrial adjustment better 
than argument. 
Much of New England was once a sea bottom.

shires of Massachusetts. Having been lifted to a 
great altitude, the ever-active work of water began 
to make even Alpine heights bow to the sea. 
Erosion caused deep dissections in the mountain 
slopes, and swiftly flowing water, filled with mate- 
rial in suspension, deepened and widened the chan- 
nels by corrasion. The valleys widened, the cur- 
rents slackened, small tributaries backed up the 
divides, which, in turn, became narrower. The 
whole province had begun to show age, when the 
eycle of change was interrupted by a visitor from 
the icy north. ; 
The Great Glacier having its origin in Labrador 
and Greenland came slowly sliding southward. It 
was a sea of ice, thousands of feet thick. Slowly 
its edge advanced; it cared little for the hills and 
mountains, its great thickness burying all. Like a 
great dull plane, it cut and pushed the soils and 
rocks ahead of it, or it ground the boulders be- 
neath into rock-flour and clay. Sometimes it 
dipped into a depression, scooping it out still 
deeper, and again it ignored wide valleys or

drift on a narrow coastal plain. In many instances

the topography was completely changed; but, 
again, at no remote distance, some granite hill, 
“‘rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,’’ lifted its 
scratched and shaven head above the thick mantle 
of drift. The receding glacier lent its water to fill 
depressions, and so were formed beautiful lakes, 
which have ever since given constant head to the 
rivers. ‘Their overflow followed ancient valleys, 
where not completely obliterated, and cut new 
channels in the drift. The erosion of new surface 
was rapid, especially as coastal margin began to 
sink, causing greater fall and more rapid cur- 
rents. Thus were laid bare the rocks, torn, ground 
and. crushed, which have ever characterized New 
England. ‘Thus were born the glacial hills around 
Boston, Worcester and the lower Merrimac, and 
the beautiful drumlins of Massachusetts and New 
York. Frequently rivers found their way around 
these barriers of recent birth, and, tumbling down 
into old channels, formed beautiful falls, as at 
Lewiston, Lowell and Holyoke. Here currents 
were swiftest and water power best; here the In- 
dians, ascending the streams in bark canoes, were 
compelled to stop; here their villages grew, and 
here, later, the English founded our modern cities. 
The coast line of New England has vastly influ- 
enced her history. The gradual submergence al- 
lowed the sea to enter the lower, wider valleys, 
drowning them and converting the river mouths 
into broad estuaries. Much of the coastal plain 
became a narrow continental shelf. Higher por- 
tions fringing the old sea became isolated, form.

ing numerous islands, of which Mt. Desert is a 
type. The intrusion of the sea into the valleys 
made the water deep and harbors good. The high 
portions between river mouths became capes and 
promontories. The enduring rocks of Cape Ann 
preserved the site of Gloucester and pointed its 
daring fishermen to the sea. Maine’s irregular 
coast, with its reéntrant bays and spearhead 
promontories so numerous and intricate, has been 
increased tenfold. 
The soils of New England when first explored 
were thin, consisting of sand, clay and till, all well 
mixed with glacial boulders. Much of the country 
was well forested. The pine thrives well in sandy 
soil, well watered, and in latitudes where there 
are extremes of heat and cold. These conditions 
prevailed in northern New England, and here 
“the murmuring pines and hemlocks’’ said their 
incantations to the sleek moose and the painted 
savage. So was New England when found by 
English Puritans. They were slow to adapt them- 
selves to their geographic environment, and hence 
their prosperity was curtailed. Their industrial 
history is almost a direct result of physiographic 
processes. For a century they sought prosperity 
in vain, through the cultivation of thin, barren, 
rocky hillsides, and, says Redway—‘‘crops of 
glacial boulders alternated with crops of trouble.’’ 
All these years, geographic barriers—the interior 
mountains and roadless forests—had confined the 
pioneers to the coastal belt. They at last con- 
ceived the idea of ship building, and, as a result,

New England’s deep, protected harbors began to 
buoy up the stately pines of, Maine. 
The Revolutionary War abolished English re- 
strictions, and this inaugurated New England’s 
first industrial revolution. A merchant marine 
sprang into existence, and New England canvas 
floated on every sea. Days of prosperity followed. 
Bank accounts grew; religious bickerings and per- 
secutions ceased. But the era of maritime pros- 
perity was soon over. The war of 1812, with 
America’s retaliatory measure, the Embargo Act, 
swept New England’s sails from the seas never to 
return; for, soon after the war was over, great 
vessels, driven by the expansive force of steam, 
were on hand ready to shriek defiance and derision 
at ships rigged with mast and sail. 
During Napoleon’s invasion of Spain he confis- 
eated many estates, and sold many flocks of fa- 
mous Merino sheep to America. These ‘found 
pasturage on the Berkshire hills and Green moun- 
tains. Importation being prevented by the War 
of 1812, New England’s idle capital began to build 
mills. Woolen goods were made in large quanti- 
ties in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Con- 
necticut. The people had discovered another of 
New England’s chief resources—her water power. 
In the meantime the cotton industry had devel- 
oped in the south. New England took advantage 
of this, and soon the cotton industry was para- 
mount. Lowell, Lawrence, Manchester and Con- 
cord owe their rapid growth to water power and 
brains in the north, and cotton and slaves in the

south. Prosperity followed man’s wise adjust- 
ment to physiographic conditions. 
New England is still a manufacturing country. 
The hemlock bark is used to tan leather. Boots 
and shoes come from Lynn and Brockton. She 
has little coal, but this is imported in sufficient 
quantities to make light metal goods, as bicycles 
at Chicopee Falls and clocks at Waterbury. The 
pulp of the spruce is used in making paper at 
Berlin. Ships are still built at Bath, and the 
lumber of the Pine Tree State is shipped from 
Bangor. The ancient limestone of Vermont is 
now quarried as marble at Rutland. At Quincy 
they get the famous granite. New England has 
always taken advantage of good fishing. But this 
is possible only through nature’s accident. The 
warm gulf current that circles Cape Cod meets 
a polar current, and the waters are tempered for 
cod, herring’ and mackerel. But many a cotton 
mill has ceased its noisy hum, and it is only a 
question of time when New England must aban- 
don the industry which has made her famous for 
nearly a century. The rapid growth of cotton 
mills in the South tells us in silent language that 
some new industrial adjustment awaits the toilers 
of the bleak New England shores. 
Truck-farming and gardening furnish employ- 
ment near the centers of population. . Farming, 
proper, is decadent. Many interior farms are en 
tirely abandoned, especially in Maine and New 
Hampshire. Tobacco is grown in the Red Sand- 
stone Valley of the Connecticut. The hills of
-P-A-G-E-73
  RELATION TO HISTORY "1 
Vermont furnish pasturage, and St. Albans is a 
dairy center. But the population is drifting to 
city and village, to harbor and factory. Phys- 
iographic factors have here, as elsewhere, deter- 
mined the distribution of population. The people 
have gone to river-valley and sea shore. Here are 
the best water power, excellent transportational 
facilities, easy access to fishing grounds, and here 
truck farmer and market gardener can ply their 
trades in more fertile valley or sandy beach and 
enjoy convenient markets, so essential to these 
industries. The inhabitants of Maine are well to 
‘the south; in New Hampshire they have settled 
on the Merrimac and the bit of coast; in Massa- 
chusetts, the shore line and the Connecticut valley 
support the densest population; while on the 
shores of Narragansett Bay dwell over nine-tenths 
of the people of Rhode Island. 
The character of the soil has aided in determin- 
ing the distribution of population. The thin soils 
were soon exhausted. The destruction of forests 
assisted in devastating the lower valleys. The 
winter snows melted rapidly, and the deluge of 
water swept debris of all kinds into the lower val- 
leys, smothering the soil with heterogeneous ma- . 
terial and driving the farmer away. The steeper 
slopes, once farmed, were so eroded by the same 
heavy rains and spring floods that all soils were 
carried away. The roots of struggling trees on 
such lands follow along the exposed rock strata, 
looking for places to fasten their tendrils in 
mother earth.
-P-A-G-E-74
  72 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
Everywhere the observing eye can discern an 
industrial adjustment to physiography. Men are 
often slow to make this adjustment, but the strong 
hand of nature whips them into line, or eventually 
drives them from a land where only half a tillage 
is possible. 
II, A CASE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFLUENCE ON INDUSTRIAL 
HISTORY IN ILLINOIS, 
The Illinois river follows the old, partially 
drift-filled channel of the pre-glacial Illinois. This 
last mentioned stream was of no mean size, being 
from one to two miles wide and carrying the over- 
flow of the once enlarged Lake Michigan. 
The Wisconsin Glacier, in its retreat, partially 
filled with drift the broad, deep channel of the pre- 
glacial Illinois, and, as if intent on obliterating 
the mighty river, it dropped the Valparaiso mo- 
raine in the form of a half moon, skirting the 
south end of Lake Michigan. It thus defied the 
lake waters to again reach the Gulf by this route. 
But the rains fell and the run-off of northern 
Tilinois and Indiana carved post-glacial channels, 
steep-sloping and narrow, in the soft drift. Of 
this character are the Fox, Des Plaines and Kan- 
kakee rivers, which now feed the Illinois. 
The present Illinois, with its greatly decreased 
volume, has been unable to remove the drift from 
its ancestor’s channel, and the river today. flows 
rather lazily, swinging against the bluffs now on 
one side and then on the other. Streams are na- 
ture’s highways of commerce, along which villages 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
RELATION TO HISTORY 73 
and cities are located and begin their careers, be- 
fore the advent of railroad or canal. So along 
the Illinois, towns and cities found their locations, 
sometimes on the bottoms and sometimes well up 
on the bluffs, overlooking for miles the curves, 
bars and islands in the river below. 
On a site of the latter type La Salle, Illinois, 
found its location. But nature had done more to 
block out the industries which should employ the 
‘citizens of La Salle, long after the glaciers had 
retreated and the buffalo and Indian had been ex- 
terminated or driven far to the westward. It hap- 
pened that an upward fold, or anticlinal fracture, 
as the geologist would say,,was formed across 
northern Illinois, beginning in the neighborhood 
of Freeport and extending in a southeastward 
direction, passing just east of the present site of 
La Salle, on into Indiana. This slow upward 
folding did not disturb the Rock and Illinois 
rivers, which cross it. They were abundantly 
able to corrade their channels deeper and deeper 
into the uprising strata, thereby causing no inter- 
ruption of their currents, but in the end flanking 
their banks with vertical cliffs of white sandstone, 
of which Castle Rock and Starved Rock are his- 
toric examples. 
This fold has served as a geographic condition 
or control, and has had much to do with the in- 
dustries of La Salle. It consisted of an upward 
bending or arching of deep-seated strata, forming 
a broad ridge. But. through the scouring of 
glaciers and the erosion of water the ridge or fold
-P-A-G-E-76
SE ee A eee RE Pee ee eee, RTS ee Pe RT ey nt ae ae ae 
YA THE TRACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
was planed off almost level with the surrounding 
country, the broken strata dipping both to the 
east and west of the axial line of the anticline. 
The disturbance brought to the surface the coal 
measures, which were left exposed as outcrops, 
and, in an early day, attracted ‘‘drift’’ miners to 
make settlements at and near La Salle. Also the 
uplift, which increased the vertical distance be- 
tween bluff altitude and water level in the river 
below, stimulated gradation, and, as a result, deep 
gulches and ravines in time communicated with 
the river, again exposing underlying seams of 
coal. 
Forced to the surface, also, was the St. Peter’s 
sandstone forming the historic cliff—Starved 
Rock. This sandstone is the raw material from 
which glass is made, and because (1) the coal was 
immediately at hand to melt the sand, and (2) be- 
cause a great commercial city was developing to 
the northeast on Lake Michigan, men took ad- 
vantage of the situation, and La Salle became a 
center for the manufacture of bottles. The glass 
industry extended also to Ottawa and Streator on 
the east slope of the anticline, practically repeat- 
ing the conditions.* 
Underneath the strata of St. Peter’s sandstone 
lies the calciferous Potsdam. It, too, was arched 
upward and exposed here where the Illinois river 
cuts the anticline. It is a notable fact, too, that 
this formation is not exposed elsewhere in Illinois. 
~* Leconte defines an anticline as a line on either side of which the 
strata repeat one another, dipping away from the axis. See Compend 
of Geology, p. 188. ’
-P-A-G-E-77
  RELATION TO HISTORY "5 
From the calciferous Potsdam excellent Port- 
land cement is made, and to one who is in posses- 
sion of this bit of geology it is perfectly clear why 
The Chicago Portland Cement Works are located 
in La Salle. The geographic conditions are as 
follows: ‘ 
1. Raw material, the Potsdam sandstone. 
2. Abundance of coal. 
3.° Nearness to a great market, Chicago. 
4. Ample shipping facilities, railroads and a 
canal. ‘ 
The above conditions are favorable to the in- 
dustry. To this may be added the fact that a wan- 
ton destruction of forests has made other build- 
ing material necessary. The use of concrete is 
one way in which man has adjusted himself to 
the changed conditions. From the summit of 
Starved Rock a number of cement plants can be 
seen. Their existence is due to one of nature’s 
freaks, and in an industrial way it illustrates geo- 
graphic (geologic) influence on human affairs, or 
history. i 
By another of nature’s accidents, the north- 
western part of Illinois and the southwestern part 
of Wisconsin escaped the scouring and planing of 
glaciers. Hyroding and denuding agencies, how- 
ever, removed the later deposits and left exposed 
the Niagara limestone, Cincinnati shales and 
Galena limestone. Galena, or lead sulphide, is 
found im the crevices and pockets of this deposit. 
Even the early settlers on farms far to the south
-P-A-G-E-78

Oe | THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
used to find profitable employment in winter by 
“drifting into’’ the pockets exposed in the gulches 
of this deeply sculptured region. Galena, Illinois, 
was named for its mineral, and Platteville, Wis- 
consin, is always associated with zine. But there 
was no coal in this region to be used in reducing 
the ore, and following the law that it is cheaper to 
take crude ore to the coal fields than to transport 
coal to the ore, the valuable ores of the southern 
part of the Driftless Area in an early day found 
their way to La Salle, where coal was plentiful 
and where communication by rail and water had 
been established with Chicago. Then, too, La 
Salle lay between Chicago and the productive zine 
fields of Joplin, Missouri, and those of eastern 
Kansas. The coal fields soon attracted this ore, 
and La Salle’s zinc-smelting and manufacturing 
industry grew as a result of geographic control. 
Nor was this all. The sulphur had to be removed 
from the zine-sulphide, and this fact led to the 
establishment of large plants for the manufacture 
of commercial sulphuric acid as a by-product. The 
industries of La Salle are directly attributable to 
this diastrophic movement of the earth’s crust, 
which lifted the coal measures several hundred 
feet and exposed the early Silurian deposits, 
making mining easier and more profitable, and 
furnishing abundant material for the manufacture 
of glass and cement. The abundance of coal at- 
tracted the zinc ore, and the smelting plants now 
in operation are among the largest in the United 
States. So important are natural resources that  
-P-A-G-E-79
RELATION TO HISTORY 77 
several railroads and a canal at an early date com- 
peted for this traffic. 
But geographic influence does not stop with in- 
dustrial history. Political history is largely 
shaped by resources and industries. La Salle’s 
industries attracted foreifners of varied nation- 
alities. The question of municipal government 
even in a small city becomes an important social 
problem. There is, too, an esthetic side to the La 
Salle problem. The deep dissection of the uplifted 
region across from La Salle has produced perhaps 
the most picturesque scenery in Illinois. It is of 
such marked beauty that it is now planned to pur- 
chase the region and set it apart for a state park. 
It abounds in hills, valleys, gulches, caiions, water- 
falls and caves, making Deer Park a rare region 
for the student of nature. But here again geo- 
graphic influence is seen. The picturesque is a 
control over the economic. Railroads, trolleys, 
ferries, hotels and hacks are busy because an anti- 
clinal fracture and sculptural gradation gave to 
La Salle this region of beauty. 
The study of French exploration has firmly as- 
sociated the heroic La Salle and his devoted Tonti 
with this region, though the busy little city that 
bears the name of the indomitable Frenchman 
may be unknown to many. Hven in savage times 
geographic conditions played their role in history. 
So Starved Rock—the inaccessible citadel, at- 
tracted the weakened Illini, and here they per- 
ished from hunger or were mercilessly butchered 
by the Pottowattamies in their effort to escape.

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Aims as stated by leading educators; aims fall in two categories; 
which is tenable? 
Adjustment to environment as an aim in geography; place adjust- 
ment; economic adjustment ;~ political or social adjustment. 
Introductory and correlative aims; geography holds a central posi- 
tion in science; it may be presented as an introduction to the 
natural sciences, or as a unifying or correlating principle fol- 
lowing the other sciences. 
How* much practical value has geography; the broad meaning of 
practical. 
Culture aim of geography; travel as a means of gaining culture; 
why geography can contribute to culture. 
I. AS DEFINED BY LEADING EDUCATORS, 
The very nature of the subject has led to the ex- 
pression of many aims or ends to which an intel- 
ligent study should lead. To begin with, any sub- 
ject must contribute to the general aim of educa- 
tion, whatever that may be, besides having specific 
values of its own. Geography, then, in its aims 
and purposes, must conform to a rational peda- 
gogy; it must lend itself in large measure, in con- 
junction with the other studies of the curriculum, 
toward the fitting of the individual to cope suc- 
80 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 81 
cessfully with his physical and social environ- 
ment. The ‘‘new geography’’ is a recognition of 
the relation between life and environment, and 
the aim becomes that of studying those things 
which contribute most to the highest development 
of the highest form of life. 
“The essential in geography is a relation be- 
tween the elements of terrestrial environment and 
the items of organic response; this being only a 
modernized extension of Ritter’s view. Every- 
thing that involves such a relationship is to that 
extent geographic. Anything in which such a re- 
lationship is wanting is to that extent. not geo- 
graphic. The location of a manufacturing village 
at a point where a stream affords water power is 
an example of the kind of relation that is meant, 
and if this example is accepted, then the reason- 
able principle of continuity will guide us to in- 
clude under geography every other example in 
which the way that organic forms have of doing 
things is conditioned by their inorganic environ- 
ment.’? The foregoing statement by W. M. Davis 
points us to the true meaning of geography. 
James Bryce, in the April, 1902, number of the 
“Journal of Geography,’’ gives the following 
categories: 
1. Geography is the foundation or starting 
point of ‘‘human studies’’—literature, his- 
tory, economics, sociology, ete. 
Practical Training in Observation. 
Training in Reflection. wr
-P-A-G-E-84
  82 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
4. Pleasure which knowledge of the subject 
adds to travel. 
Richard Elwood Dodge, in ‘‘Teachers’ College 
Record’? for March, 1901, gives the following 
aims: 
1. Knowledge — understanding geographical 
conditions. 
Power—ability to think clearly and ac- 
curately. 
3. Interdependence—study of inter-relations 
of peoples and individuals, and inde- 
pendence of all. 
4. Citizénship—ability to combat successfully 
with social and physical environment. bo 
In more general terms W. T. Harris states the 
aims of school subjects as follows:* ‘‘The 
branches of study pursued in the elementary 
schools are chosen for the purpose of securing 
two useful and reasonable ends. In the first place, 
they are chosen to give the child an ability to un- 
derstand his environment and to come into a 
mastery of it, so that he may make it useful to 
himself. He is taught arithmetic in order that he 
may divide and conquer; in order that he may 
measure the things and forces of his environment, 
and learn how to adapt one set of them to control 
and utilize another. He is taught geography in 
order that he may understand the causal relations 
existing between his habitat, or the place in which 
*See “Forum,” January, 1902.
-P-A-G-E-85
  AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 83 
he lives, and other places, as well as other systems 
of things and events on the earth. 
On the other hand, a second reason for adopt- 
ing a branch in the course of study is that it de- 
velops some faculty or power in the child, and 
gives him possession of himself in that respect; 
for one of the primary objects is to develop the 
intellect, the memory, the judgment, or the heart. 
By the expression heart I mean the aggregate of 
affections and inclinations of the soul. Some dis- 
cipline in school, like writing, drawing, calis- 
thenics, or manual training, finds its place in the 
curriculum because of its power to develop the 
will, the tenacity of purpose, the ability to pay 
long and continuous attention to one thing, and 
to form habits of industry, cleanliness, regularity, 
and punctuality, and thus acquire those virtues 
which make a man a better citizen than he could 
possibly be without them—which make his service 
of more value to his fellow-men, and give him the 
ability to get a larger share of service from them 
than he otherwise could.’’ 
Professor R. H. Whitbeck submits the following 
thesis: * ‘‘The primary aim in teaching ele- 
mentary geography is to give facts that are likely 
to be useful in practical life; to differentiate be- 
tween things which are fundamental and those 
which are only incidental; and so to impress the 
fundamental that they shall become a permanent 
possession of the pupil.’’ 
The advocates of the ‘‘new geography’’ recog- 
* Proc. N. E. A., 1908, p. 972.
-P-A-G-E-86
    84 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
nize its practical value. That geography can 
be useful in the life of an individual or race is evi- 
dently accepted by. the Paris Commercial Geog- 
raphy Society, the aim of which according to its 
report is: 
1. ‘*To place science at the disposal of com- 
merce, and to put theory in practice; 
2. ‘To aggrandize France by developing in- 
dustry and commerce abroad; 
3. ‘To receive and sift information from all 
parts of the world, and store up facts which 
may be freely drawn upon by all who can 
turn them to good account, whether for 
‘ commerce or for theoretical study; 
4. “‘To extend the study of everything which 
promotes agriculture, manufacture or 
trade, both at home and in the colonies; 
5. ‘‘To show the mass of the people that they 
are interested in the products, export and 
import, of their own and other countries, 
and that knowledge leads to foresight, and 
foresight leads to power.”’ 
A consideration of the ‘‘aims’’ of geography 
teaching, as stated by educators, reveals the fact 
that they fall into two categories, viz: those who 
have for their object the disciplining of the mind, 
and, second, those whose purpose it is to acquaint 
the pupil with his environment and teach him its 
use. The aims which can be consistently included 
in the second category are rational and tenable; 
but those in the first, considered in the light of
-P-A-G-E-87
AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 85 
modern psychology, are irrational and untenable. 
If training in one field of learning could carry 
over and explain problems in new fields of an en- 
tirely different character, then, perhaps, we might 
justify mental training as an aim of any depart- 
ment of education, as, for example, geography. 
This not being the case, we can indorse only those 
aims which are directly and vitally concerned in 
preparing the child for active life. Mental train- 
ing must be incidental. 
In James Bryce’s enumeration of aims, the 
value of geography as a foundation for history, 
literature, sociology and economics is at once ap- 
parent, as those subjects lead to an understanding 
of human institutions and human nature. We 
cannot subscribe to the training of the perceptive 
and reflective powers per se except in the sense 
above stated. The additional pleasure which a 
‘reader or traveler can obtain through a knowledge 
of the earth, its people and institutions, is suffi- 
cient reason for its study. If more of the es- 
thetic entered into the education of the poor, espe- 
cially, their lives would not only be better but 
happier. 
_ The aims as stated by Professor Dodge can be 
interpreted so as to make them the legitimate ob- 
jects of geographical study. They are briefly but 
clearly set forth in the ‘‘Teachers’ College Rec- 
ord’’ of March, 1901. 
Dr. Harris makes the understanding of environ- 
ment an important aim of all studies, and espe- 
cially of the study of geography. His second

statement, however, seems to suggest rather too 
strongly the doctrine of formal discipline. The 
idea of individual efficiency: to the end that one 
may be of service to his fellows is fully in accord 
with the modern movement of ‘‘social efficiency’’ 
as the aim of education. 
II, GEOGRAPHY IN THE LIGHT OF ADJUSTMENT TO EN- 
VIRONMENT. 
The educational principle which determines all 
values must be more clearly recognized. It is the 
principle of ‘‘adjustment,’’ which means that the 
individual must be adapted to his environment; 
aust be able to make use of it for protection, sus- 
tenance, fuller development, and happiness. This 
is the view of Spencer, G. Stanley Hall, M. V. 
O’Shea, Frederick E. Bolton, Edward L. Thorn- 
dike and others. On this principle must be deter- 
mined not only the value of geography but of 
every study in the school curriculum. 
No one is educated who has not a fairly good 
fund of geographical facts and a reasonably clear 
notion of the science necessary to their under- 
standing. The transactions of everyday life de- 
mand a knowledge of place. One must locate per- 
sons and places with a fair degree of accuracy, 
poth with relation to himself and with relation to 
other fixed places, or his view of things will be 
much distorted. Every nation is dependent, and 
as such must know where other nations dwell, 
what of excess they produce, what they themselves 
cannot produce, what terms for exchange can be
-P-A-G-E-89
AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 8y- 
effected, and what routes and modes of carriage 
can be resorted to. It is impossible to conceive of 
a civilized community without international rela- 
tions, and hence an educated people must under- 
stand these relations and have clear conceptions 
of foreign countries and foreign peoples. James 
Bryce emphasizes strongly the additional pleasure 
that comes to travelers who have made a study of 
the country through which they are passing. 
Tourists invariably study the geography of the 
region they expect to visit, before starting on 
their journey. Indeed, it is often said that one 
can gain a liberal education through travel. The 
truth of this lies in the fact that travel places the 
individual in so many and in such complex situa- 
tions that he learns to adjust himself to new con- 
ditions without great inconvenience or embarrass- 
ment. 
A place adjustment is one of the first to be 
noted, and this fact, no doubt, has led to the over- 
emphasis of locative geography. That physiog- 
raphy has much to do in determining the distri- 
bution of population can be instanced almost any- 
where. Salubrious climates, rich soils and natural 
roadways have had much to do in determining 
density of population. Cities thrive on seaboards 
where sinking coasts permit the ocean waters 
to encroach upon the lower river valleys, afford- 
ing deep and quiet waters for harbors. Lake 
cities develop rapidly where there are navigable 
waters from the lake to the sea, and where the 
topography, soils, temperature and rainfall favor  
-P-A-G-E-90
88 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
agricultural pursuits in the surrounding region, 
or where the lake shore rocks abound in valuable 
minerals. Chicago is an example of the first kind 
and Duluth of the second kind. Cities also find 
their location and owe their growth to breaks in 
transportation occurring at the head of naviga- 
tion of rivers, or at the entrance of mountain 
passes. St. Paul is located at the head of naviga- 
tion of the Mississippi river, and Denver is often 
ealied a ‘‘mountain gate’’ city. Thriving cities 
often find their location at river-falls, which offer 
excellent water power, and at the same time de- 
termine the head of navigation. In general, breaks 
in navigation determine the location and influence 
the development of cities. 
As already stated, soils, temperature and mois- 
ture have much to do in determining the distribu- 
tion of population. If all of these conditions are 
favorable, dense population may be expected. If, 
however, any one of these conditions is decidedly 
unfavorable, it may restrict very largely the 
density of population. Many parts of Arizona 
would be very productive if there were sufficient 
rainfall, but owing to a scarcity of moisture this 
condition outweighs all other conditions which in 
themselves may be favorable. The Prairie Plains 
support a dense population because the conditions 
individually seem to favor the life and activities 
of man. Soils, also, are very potent factors. The 
fine silt deposited in old Lake Agassiz now forms 
the rich soils and level surface of the Red River 
Valley and forms the highly productive soils now
-P-A-G-E-91
AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 89 
sought eagerly by thousands of ambitious home- 
seekers. In contrast to this may be mentioned 
the abandoned farms of New Hampshire, where 
long cultivation has exhausted the productivity 
of the soils, or where the slopes have caused a 
run-off so rapid that the finer soils have been car- 
ried to the lower valleys or even to the sea, thus 
leaving the hillside farms too unproductive to 
warrant their cultivation. The inhabitants in 
such cases have gone to the factory towns or cities, 
where their labor brings better returns. In this 
ease, physiographic conditions play a double role: 
unfavorable conditions, on one hand, tend to drive 
the inhabitants from agricultural pursuits, while, 
on the other hand, a manufacturing industry made 
possible by navigable streams and waterfalls in- 
vites them to enter a new field of industry. In- 
stances could easily be multiplied. It is sufficient 
to say that, excluding the influence of economic 
geology and the economic relationship which pro- 
ductive areas bear to cities and other densely pop- 
ulated regions, place adjustment is determined 
almost wholly by physiographic conditions. 
There is an adjustment, geographical in its na- 
ture, which is brought about if not independently 
at least indirectly of physiographic conditions. It 
is that relationship which exists between pro- 
ductive and consumptive areas, and which seems 
to grow out of the needs and demands of a city or 
a densely populated region, as related to the needs 
and demands of the immediately adjacent coun- 
try. Of course, the same principle works at
-P-A-G-E-92
  
90 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
great distances, but since the operation of the 
principle can be seen more plainly at short range, 
our illustrations will be chosen accordingly.. Rural 
communities adjacent to large cities usually 
devote themselves to supplying urban needs. Re- 
stricted areas demand intensified industries. In 
such eases the controlling principle is economic 
rather than physiographic. The region about 
Chicago, for instance, is given up largely to truck- 
ing and dairying. Elgin, Illinois, so noted as a 
dairy center, derived its original impulse from 
Chicago, though its product now is widely dis- 
tributed. A trip from Chicago to Milwaukee con- 
vinces us of the importance of trucking. Hence, 
we see readily that the industries are sometimes 
dependent upon population centers, and are not, 
in such cases, largely determined by physio- 
graphic factors. Regions remote from important 
markets and equally well adapted for the produc- 
tion of grain or stock usually market a much 
larger ratio of stock than of grain. The reverse is 
often true of similar regions located near great 
markets. 
Commercial geography concerns itself very 
largely with the operation of economic: laws which 
are so important that valuable contributions to the 
subject are appearing under the caption of ‘‘Hco- 
nomic Geography.”’ 
Thus it may be seen that one of the aims of 
geography is to trace out certain of these eco- 
nomic relationships or adjustments. 
In addition to the adjustments above men-
-P-A-G-E-93
  AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 91° 
tioned, there seems to be a political or social ad- 
justment which plays its part especially in com- 
mercial geography. The legal commercial rela- 
tionships which exist between different countries 
have much to do in controlling the industries of 
the countries, and the tariff laws in any country 
have much to do with the manufacturing and 
transporting industries. To understand fully 
what people are doing in any country, and why 
they are so engaged, one must certainly take into 
consideration physiographic, economic, social and 
political conditions. 
III. INTRODUCTORY AND CORRELATIVE AIMS. 
Reference has been made under the definition of 
geography to its relation to other subjects. It 
occupies a central position; the other branches 
“‘diverge from it as specialized departments.’’ 
Such being the relation, geography affords the 
only true basis for the study of natural science. 
For this reason it is urged that the rational ele- 
ment, the science phase, should receive due em- 
phasis, inasmuch as the large majority of pupils 
will never have the advantage of secondary in- 
struction in these specialized departments. In 
this case, geography will give the pupil a general 
view of the earth-phenomena with which ele- 
mentary education so largely deals; and, if he 
enter the high school, it will serve as an introduc- 
tion to the physical and biological sciences. Per- 
haps this view accounts for the appearance of the 
physical geography in the freshman program of
-P-A-G-E-94
  92 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
most high schools. Educators hold that it thus 
furnishes a radiating center from which the pupil 
may proceed understandingly. Others advocate ’ 
the teaching of physical geography in the senior 
year of the secondary school, on the ground that 
the study will serve the important function of 
tying together, unifying and organizing the in- 
formation gained from other sources, thus making 
all more definite and significant. 
Iv. THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF GEOGRAPHY. 
No one will challenge the practical value of 
geography. But if we accept the narrow meaning 
of ‘‘practical,’’? geography is limited in its appli- 
cation quite largely to immediate environment. 
Home geography is very important. There are 
also many facts of geography that are of this 
practical value to individuals engaged in the com- 
mercial industry. If, however, we accept the 
broader meaning of practical, there can be no 
question concerning the value of geography. It 
has been pointed out repeatedly in this volume 
that the many points of contact between geog- 
raphy and life make this subject of distinct value 
in the educational process. Since practical value, 
in both senses, has been assumed, no further dis- 
cussion will here be indulged in. 
Vv. THE CULTURE AIM OF GEOGRAPHY, 
Heretofore in our discussions we have dealt 
with the concrete and practical side of the subject. 
Geography, especially mature geography, has a
-P-A-G-E-95
  AIMS OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY 93 
very high cultural value. If culture is te be held 
up as an aim of education, geography will then 
come in for an important place. Any subject that 
has so many phases and which enters into so many 
of the avenues of life cannot fail to contribute 
much that is cultural. This statement may not 
appeal to those who have made little or no study 
of geography; but those who believe that educa- 
tion is an adjustment to environment, physical 
and social, and who have pursued the study until 
the breadth and richness are apparent, readily 
concede its cultural value. Furthermore, geog- 
raphy includes so much of science and is so closely 
related to history, literature and economics, that 
its cultural value is very evident. Many students 
of geography assert that there is no subject that 
has done more to broaden their intellectual out- 
look and to deepen their appreciation of nature 
and life generally than has ‘the study of geog- 
raphy. 5 
SUGGESTIONS AND QUESTIONS. 
1. What is the present day aim of education? Should geography 
contribute to this general aim? 
2. What, then, is the chief purpose of teaching geography? 
3. To what extent ought the practical aim to dominate in geog- 
raphy teaching? The cultural? 
4, What seems to be the consensus of opinion of educators as to 
the aim of geography teaching? Quote several writers. 
5. Illustrate the value of a knowledge of geography to a farmer 
living near a large city. To a merchant in the city. What 
sort of geographical knowledge do transportation companies 
seek?

    94. THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
FOR FURTHER STUDY. 
1. Waste in education is very largely the result of aimless teach- 
ing. Try for a time, at least, to justify each lesson that you 
teach. If you do this, you must have some basis for selection. 
Thus will the aim of education in general and of geography in 
particular, force themselves upon you. 
2. Observe lessons in geography and compare the genuine thought- 
work with that of memorized statement. Which predominates? 
Why? Which is more valuable? Why? 
3. What percent of the geography which you learned in school has 
been of use to you in your life experiences?

CHAPTER VII. 
Human anp Soctat GrocrapHy. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The terms ‘‘human”’ and ‘‘social’’; the real meaning of human 
geography; how primitive man adjusts himself to his geo- 
graphic environment; how civilized man modifies his geo- 
graphic environment to better serve his needs; the narrow 
view of human geography. 
Geography in the light of social efficiency; how it contributes to 
social efficiency; usefulness of geographic knowledge. 
Geography involves principles of economics; the self-sufficing 
versus the commercial economy;, geography, rightly studied, 
re-acts against formalism; geography and nature study tend 
to engender a humane spirit. 
The terms human and social, as applied to 
geography, are often used synonymously. The 
writer believes, however, that there is some dis- 
tinetion. Human geography, generally speaking, 
refers to the activities of man, of human beings, 
and the various ways in which his activities and 
industries ultimately affect social environment. 
But human activities sometimes affect environ- 
ment in such an indirect manner, or so slowly, 
that the influence is not very apparent. Social 
. geography includes those activities and industries 
whose influence upon society is more direct and 
immediate. Under this head belong political and

commercial geography. Our regulating systems, 
such as interstate commerce laws, the tariff and 
other regulations which in their application 
greatly affect production and transportation, 
serve as effective controls over industries, and, 
as such, are elements of social geography. 
I. HUMAN GEOGRAPHY. 
That the so-called ‘‘human side’’ of geography 
is of prime importance and chief interest in the 
study of the subject is readily admitted. But 
that ‘‘geography is a study of the earth as the 
home of man,’’ and nothing more, is neither com- 
prehensive nor scientific. Geography is highly 
complex and the danger here, as in other fields 
of study, is that undue recognition and emphasis 
shall be given to some particular phase. 
The conception of geography, elsewhere given,* 
does not limit the subject to ‘‘the earth as the 
home of man;”’’ the oak tree, the pond-lily and the 
coral polyp; the antelope, horned toad and bird of 
paradise, are each and all inhabitants of the 
earth and, as such, each has its characteristics 
determined by geographic controls. So far as 
man is concerned he is simply one of the creatures 
of the earth; he battles with his environment, re- 
sponds to its influence, and in the end survives or 
perishes the same as do the myriads of lower life 
forms about him. His advantage lies in the fact 
that intelligence, rather than mere instinct, en- 
ables him to conquer where his lower brothers

HUMAN AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY oY 
fail. It is readily conceded that whatever touches 
the life of man most directly should first gain the 
attention of the student. Hence the study of 
one’s immediate environment is of prime impor- 
tance, first, because the things studied, apply 
directly to his life and therefore appeal strongly 
to his interests, and again because these first- 
hand notions constitute his intellectual capital, by 
means of which he is to come into possession of 
world-knowledge. 
In using the expression ‘‘human geography’’ 
we must not think of man as outside of the realm 
of geography, yet reacting in some way upon 
things geographic, but we should rather regard 
him as a response of the highest type, to environ- 
ing conditions. Such a view is evolutjonary and 
rational. The characteristics of the Eskimo, the 
native Ethiopian, and the inhabitant of the tem- 
perate regions, all exemplify this truth. Wherein, 
then, is found the human side of geography? 
The answer is found in the following: 
1, That man adjusts himself to environing 
conditions. 
2. That whenever these conditions are un- 
favorable to the best life, but capable of improve- 
ment, man modifies and reorganizes his environ- 
ment and makes it serve him the better. 
The first —the adjustment of man to an un- 
changed environment—is universal, but best illus- 
trated by the life of a savage or barbaric people. 
The second is the characteristic quality of civil- 
ized nations.
-P-A-G-E-100
  98 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
Slowly but surely men adjust themselves to 
physiographic conditions. The wisest adjustment 
and the highest success are coincident. These 
principles determine the growth and location of 
industries and the distribution of population. The 
pine woods and deep estuaries of Meine in an 
early day led to ship building. The people who 
lived on the capes and promontories (Gloucester, 
Massachusetts, is a good example) became fisher- 
men because they were really out at sea even 
when their boats were at the dock. The oyster 
industry of Chesapeake bay owes its existence to 
a shallow sea, as otherwise, dredging for the crop 
would be difficult. The inner lowlands of Ala- 
bama, with their rich limestone soils, were se 
lected as a, superior region for the production of 
cotton. The arid west, with its plains and moun- 
tains, is a grazing region, not because its pas- 
turage in any degree compares with that of the 
prairie plains, but because, under the existing 
conditions, herding yields the best returns and is, 
therefore, a wise adjustment to physiographic 
conditions. In every case of localized industry it 
has been man’s function to discover what form 
of activity or what crop-system is best suited to 
a region and hence will yield the largest income. 
The human side of geography shows itself in a 
more positive manner when man modifies, in some, 
marked degree, his geographical surroundings. 
Instances of this kind are found in the construc- 
tion of great commercial highways, in the recla- 
mation of the vast arid regions, in the drainage 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
HUMAN AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY ° 99 
of swamps and in increasing the productive capac- 
ity of the soils. The discovery of an abandoned 
waterway westward across New York led some 
emigrant trains across the Appalachian barrier 
in an early day; but when man deepened the chan- 
nel and transformed it into an artery of commerce 
connecting the Hudson with Lake Erie, the real 
significance of the physiographic factor, as modi- 
fied by man, at once became apparent. The east 
and west alike responded to the new control, and 
no history of our country is complete that does 
not take cognizance of the opening of the Erie 
Canal. The building of trans-continental rail- 
roads and inter-oceanic canals, therefore, well 
illustrates the human factor in geography. 
_ There are those who interpret human geography 
to mean only the industrial and commercial ac- 
tivities of man. This is not a broad or funda- 
mental view of the subject. The study of indus- 
tries may or may not be geographic. Jf mere 
technique is considered they certainly lose such 
significance. It is not so much ‘‘just how a thing 
is made,’’ but its influence upon other industries, 
upon people and countries, when it is made, that 
makes it of geographic importance. The exist- 
ence of waterfalls may lead to the erection of a 
factory; the consequent industry may require ad- 
ditional facilities; an infiux of people follows and 
a city springs into existence; now, the adjacent 
country responds to a ne by the industrial 
center for more food and supplies. The country 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  100 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
people change their crop-systems* to meet new de- 
mands, they are more prosperous, they live better, 
and eventually they improve and develop lands 
that, under the old regime, they could not afford 
to cultivate. In this sense, an industry is geo- 
graphical in nature. It is only fair to say, how- 
ever, that as more improved machinery and‘meth- 
ods are employed and, therefore, the production 
of raw material is stimulated, and the output 
brought within the means of larger numbers of 
people, that the method of work assumes the na- 
ture of a geographical control. The invention 
and use of Whitney’s cotton gin is an instance of 
this kind. 
In its deepest and best sense, then, human 
geography is apparent in those activities of a 
people which finally assume the nature of geo- 
graphic controls, and, therefore, have a far- 
reaching and often lasting influence upon the dis- 
tribution of population, industrial life, social de- 
velopment, and geographic conditions. As stated 
above, this phase of geographical study may be 
reduced to two general principles, viz.: (1) man’s 
intelligent adjustment to physiographic condi- 
tions and (2) the improvement of those conditions, 
whenever possible, for the purpose of making his 
life and the life of his fellows richer and more 
abundant. 
II, SOCIAI, GEOGRAPHY. 
Effective citizenship includes (1) the individ-   
“* See Agricultural Economics, Taylor.
-P-A-G-E-103
HUMAN AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY 101 
ual’s ability and inclination toward self-support, 
and (2) an intelligence which enables him to main- 
tain himself and at the same time so to order his 
economic and social relations that his fellows may 
enjoy equal opportunity with him. It includes a 
will to place social well-being ahead of individual 
welfare. 
An efficient citizen has productive capacity. 
He produces that which ministers directly to the 
material needs of society; he assists in securing 
social conditions — laws and regulations — which 
favor individual prosperity; and more indirectly, 
he helps in the production of a general intelli- 
gence and a public spirit which are always in- 
centives to individual endeavor. 
The very nature of geography makes its formal 
study valuable in securing the social attitude just 
referred to. One of the first advantages of geog- 
raphy as a formal study arises from the fact that 
it is concrete; that suitable data are everywhere 
available; and that an inductive procedure is 
possible. The true geography of the earth is 
the geography of today, and the most impor- 
tant geography for any individual is his local 
geography. 
If social efficiency is a legitimate aim in edu- 
cation, material should be selected that will con- 
tribute to its development ;—material, a knowl- 
edge of which may be made to function in every 
day life. The richness of the subject-matter of 
geography permits of great selection and makes 
possible the useful expression of the lessons 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  \ 
102 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
taught. The present educational reform is that 
of pulling the schools away from a traditional 
past and aligning them with the living present. 
Every social being lives through inter-relation- 
ships with his complete environment—earth and 
stone,—wood and iron,—air and water,—plants 
and animals,—his friends and business associates 
—and to these he relates himself and of these he 
makes legitimate use, in his struggle for improved 
existence. Geography, then, deals with element- 
ary facts of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, 
economics and sociology, not as borrowed mate- 
rials but as legitimate parts of its own content; 
and, because it deals with numerous actual life 
conditions, its subject-matter is rich, significant, 
and pertinent in every day life. 
At the outset, geography teaches many facts 
concerning rural and urban life, directly useful 
to the individual in gaining a point of vantage 
in his struggle for a better existence. , Agricul- 
ture and nature study will help in bringing use- 
ful information, but for a long time geography 
must continue to be the main source of knowledge 
and insight relating to community life. Some 
knowledge of the regular occurrence of cyclonic 
storms, and of the practical assistance of the 
weather bureau; elementary facts concerning the 
cultivation, fertility and means of maintaining 
productive capacity of soils; information concern- 
ing the reciprocal needs of city and country, sug- 
gesting advantageous industrial pursuits; authen- 
tic facts relating to regions somewhat remote and
-P-A-G-E-105
  HUMAN AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY 103 
serving in some measure to guide the course of 
emigration; such knowledge as this seems to be 
directly and practically useful; and is contributed 
very largely through the study of geography. 
Poverty is a great handicap to efficiency of life— 
and therefore, whatever tends towards prosperity 
brings opportunity for individual development. 
Hence practical instruction in geography contrib- 
utes to effective citizenship. 
Geography involves principles of practical eco- 
nomics. The practice of a true economy increases 
the productive capacity of the individual, which 
leads to increased prosperity, and makes possible 
greater social usefulness. 
It is not meant that formal instruction in eco- 
nomics will be given, but that a full understanding 
of commercial geography, especially, will require 
some consideration of the laws that govern pro- 
duction, transportation and consumption. 
A commercial economy dominates modern agri- 
cultural life, because such economy brings the 
largest long-time net profit. Obviously, the prac- 
tice of the best farmers is the production of one 
or two commodities for the market, it having been 
previously determined what commodities will 
bring the largest profits, with a given outlay of 
labor and capital. With his proceeds the farmer 
buys many things which it is possible to produce 
on the farm. Most of the farmers in central Iii- 
nois buy their flour on the open market because 
they recognize the fact that the farmers of Min- 
nesota and the Dakotas who are making a busi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
104 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
ness of raising wheat, and the millers of Minne- 
apolis who are making a business of converting 
it into flour, can furnish the product at a less 
cost than the Illinois farmer (whose business is 
to raise corn and fatten stock) and the local miller 
can produce it. The principle applies to a score 
of things which the farmer could produce but 
does not, because he can buy them cheaper. 
Boys and girls in the upper grades can be in- 
terested in comparing with this commercial econ- 
omy the self-sufficing economy practiced by the 
early New England people, and the advantages 
of the modern system-will readily be appreciated. 
The study of production, transportation and 
consumption, as involved in geography, are re- 
lated industrial and economic problems which will 
broaden the pupil’s outlook and define his rela- 
tions to both his physical and social environment. 
As a response to environing conditions, the people 
of one region produce a certain useful product 
while the inhabitants of a remote region may pro- 
duce something equally useful. Through trans- 
portation, the surplus of each is conveyed to the 
other, and as a result each will have its productive 
capacity enhanced. The pupil may come to see 
that no individual or community can, independ- 
ently of other individuals or communities, live as 
well or produce as much, as is possible through 
the reciprocal helpfulness of exchange. Such an 
outlook, it would seem, will make the future citi- 
zen more rational in his industrial pursuits, and 
more democratic in the exercise of his civil rights. 
   
-P-A-G-E-107
HUMAN AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY 105 
Geography is the best medium through which 
education can be shifted from the formal and 
symbolic to the rational and scientific. There cer- 
tainly is no school subject in which the relations 
of cause and effect are more clearly and more 
often apparent than they are in geography. The 
pupil may here find real explanations for real 
things. No longer need they accept things on 
formal statements. The great forces which domi- 
nate nature are typified at the very door of the 
school, and there pupils may study them in an 
undistorted condition. School-work and life-work 
here meet on common grounds. No improvised 
laboratory is needed to bridge the chasm between 
the symbolic and the genuine. Inductively the 
pupil reaches his conclusions and such a proce- 
dure encourages a scientific mental habit, fatal 
to tradition and superstition. Citizenship cannot 
be effective until the individual is rational, and 
is disposed to an impartial consideration of social 
and civic problems. Public spirit and civic pride 
are terms which suggest social helpfulness and 
community good. Are they not attributes of those 
capable of analyzing conditions and reaching log- 
ical conclusions? If effective citizenship can any- 
where be taught directly, it would seem that a 
study of rational geography in the upper grades 
might serve in this capacity. 
Geography and nature study tend toward a de- 
velopment of a humanitarian spirit through the 
sympathy and interest which they beget for the
-P-A-G-E-108
  ! 
106 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
lower forms of life. The effective citizen must 
be humane and altruistic. He must live and let 
live. In general, this spirit may be awakened and 
nourished through the observance of the universal 
struggle for existence. Children who have been 
well directed in nature study, do not wantonly 
trample upon wild flowers, mutilate the branches 
of trees, or destroy harmless life. They come to 
see, also, the use of much that is inanimate and 
inorganic, and finally they may arrive at a con- 
ception of life as manifold relationships and in- 
teractions with environment. Such an attitude 
toward nature is at once ethical and moral. Social 
efficiency depends very largely upon the ability to 
appreciate proper relationships and to estimate 
proper uses. The inventor calmly reflects upon 
the needs of society and then turns his attention 
to some material thing which he adjusts to human 
use, and so establishes a new relationship between 
man and nature. The effective citizen must have 
sufficient insight into geographical environment 
to discern adjustments and modifications that will 
benefit himself and the community; but such -an 
understanding engenders an interest and sym- 
pathy which is quite akin to the humanitarian 
spirit of a purely social environment. Hence it 
may be said that any modification of physical or 
social environment that improves social condi- 
tions and enhances social welfare is a geographic 
control and belongs to the social phase of 
geography.

utterly cruel.’’ ‘‘Long life and length of days’’ 
come only to the creature whose environment is

110 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY , 
favorable to its needs. Organisms either find de- 
sirable homes and congenial company, or vanish 
from the earth altogether. The security of life is 
contingent upon environment. The interesting 
adaptations of plants to secure sunlight, water, 
and food; and of animals to secure food, and for 
rivalry and defense, establish the fact that» de- 
pendence characterizes every organism by deter- 
mining its nature. 
Animals derive food either directly or indirectly 
from plants, for they alone possess the important 
function of organizing inorganic materials. Since 
the two kingdoms must occupy the same domain, 
the struggle for existence is made more intense. 
But plants, in turn, are dependent upon proper 
conditions of temperature, moisture and soils. 
The temperature of any region leads to a con- 
sideration of the sun and its effect upon earth and 
atmosphere; moisture takes into account the 
aqueous envelope as affected by heat and winds; 
and soils result from the combined action of all 
these factors and forces upon the rock crust of 
the earth. Plants do not thrive in regions where 
the temperature remains long at or below 32°, 
as water is necessary to dissolve and transport 
nourishment. A meager precipitation of moisture, 
for a similar reason, stunts plant. growth; but 
with sufficient moisture and a sufficiently high 
temperature there is scarce a region in the world 
that would not ‘‘blossom as the rose.’’ 
A consideration of man’s distribution and de- 
velopment reveals positive evidence of his re-  
-P-A-G-E-113
  
GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE 114 
sponse to physiographic conditions. Temperature 
and moisture are chief among these, not only be- 
cause they affect man directly, but because they 
determine the productiveness of habitable areas. 
A study of the progress of civilization leads to 
the conclusions (1) that range and variation in 
climatie conditions are favorable to civilization 
and culture, and (2) that extreme and uniform 
conditions are unfavorable to the advancement of 
civilization. 
Tropical regions support a luxuriant vegetation 
in response to high temperature, liberal rainfall 
and alluvial soils. The food supply is generous 
and were it not for other less favorable condi- 
tions a dense population might flourish. The 
range of temperature is scarcely more than ten 
degrees, and, in addition to the enervating influ- 
ence upon human beings, it permits an uninter- 
rupted plant growth, insuring abundant food with 
but little expense of human energy. The rank 
vegetation becomes a barrier which man declines 
to penetrate, partly because intertwining plants 
and vines obstruct his path, and partly because 
this tropical verdure harbors a dreaded animal 
and insect life. Resistance to life, so far as food 
and shelter are concerned, is reduced to the min- 
imum; the palm alone may furnish all that human 
life demands for mere subsistence... Excessive 
heat causes man to languish in the shade; ex- 
cessive moisture breeds disease and makes culti- 
vation difficult. The uniform climate and unlim- 
ited varieties in vegetation become monotonous
-P-A-G-E-114
  112 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
and oppressive. Plant life holds the scepter! Man 
is over-awed with the fierceness and regularity 
of environing conditions. Long subjection has 
brought with it resignation and mental decadence. 
What wonder, then, that the primitive mind 
should reverence forces so irresistible as scorch- 
ing suns, angry skies, gigantic trees and ferocious 
beasts! What wonder that man should abandon 
a struggle for supremacy in which the odds are 
so against him! 
Civilization is also in a low stage in the Arctic 
regions. The Eskimo’s struggle for existence is 
so intense that all human effort is expended in 
extorting from nature a meager support. If we 
reflect on the conditions of his environment, we 
shall discover the most depressing monotony in 
the long silent night with only lurid gleams of 
light, in the illimitable expanse of glacial ice, in 
the absence of vegetation, in the desolate climate, 
and in the few species of animal life; surely his is 
a “universe of sky and snow.’’ Here, again, 
nature outbalances man, and ambition is weighed 
down by conditions so monotonous that no excita- 
tions appeal to him except those for food and 
shelter. Even the food that he eats so lacks 
variety that the building up of a sensitive and 
susceptible organism is impossible. He is as 
stolid as the world in which he dwells. Being 
driven for long periods to his home by the rigors 
of the clime, his emotional nature responds to 
enforced retirement and hence he manifests a 
strong love for home and family. Surely his is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE 113 
case of arrested development, as growth in intel- 
ligence demands at least some surplus energy 
after & mere livelihood is insured. hlene 
Temperate regions are characterized by a great 
range of temperature and a varying supply of 
moisture. A rigorous climate demands well built 
homes and warm clothing; short summers demand 
great activity in order to mature crops; indigen- 
ous food-plants do not abound; soils produce only 
when carefully cultivated; woods are relatively 
searce; metals are abundant but often difficult to 
obtain; and mountain barriers frequently sepa- 
rate productive areas. The variety of influences 
in environment demands versatile and symmet- 
vical development. Even sudden weather-changes 
stimulate mind and body. Life becomes abundant 
only when it establishes many relations. Intel- 
lectual life is quickened in the consideration of 
that which is economic and advantageous. Rivalry 
and competition make life strenuous. Just as the 
equable temperature of the tropics minimizes 
man’s needs and leads to responses that are uni- 
form, so the temperate realm multiplies the neces- 
saries of life and brings a variety of responses. 
The high temperature of summer, following a 
severe winter, is a powerful industrial stimulus, 
and the reactions which lessen the tension come 
in the form of linen clothing, electric fans, manu- 
factured ice, open cars, railroads to mountain re- 
treats and seaside resorts. So millions of men 
are busy because the sun has mounted higher in 
the heavens.
-P-A-G-E-116
  114 | THE YEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
According to Herbert Spencer life is the process 
of establishing an equilibrium with environment. 
The more intricate and complex the equilibrial 
processes become, the higher the degree of life 
and the higher the scale of civilization. In low 
forms of life the adjustments to environment are 
simple, and the accommodations are largely ef- 
fected by the organisms themselves. Every ani- 
mal must either respond to the demands for food 
and protection from enemies, or become extinct. 
The tropical inhabitant adjusts himself to his 
surroundings almost completely; he lives in caves 
or in the shelter of trees, wears little clothing and 
subsists on fruits, roots and insects. He is a 
direct response to an equable climate and a highly 
productive soil abounding with indigenous food- 
plants. Provision for the future is unnecessary, 
hence irresponsive and indolent habits are conse- 
quent reactions. Inactivity and stupidity are 
direct responses to conditions that make life easy. 
So nature, here violent and monotonous, outbal- 
ances a manhood that places little value upon an 
‘existence that is so generously bestowed. 
Re-creation of environment is the test of en- 
lightened civilization. In the lower stages of 
civilization, man stooped to adjust himself to na- 
ture and so became enslaved; but in highly civil- 
ized races, men have developed tastes and needs 
which nature, alone, cannot satisfy. So human 
ingenuity and discovery are summoned to trans- 
form material resources, and the work of nature 
is consummated with an artificial touch, which
-P-A-G-E-117
GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE . 115 
makes it serve more perfectly a fastidious people. 
All arts and industries, all crafts and trades, 
have, in the end, a single function to perform, 
viz., the promotion of natural resources to greater 
usefulness. But all modifications of material re- 
sources demand an intellectual alertness which 
marks progress in civilization. 
It is interesting to trace out the history of 
localized: industries, and one is soon convinced 
that favorable productive conditions, coupled with 
advantageous means of distribution, are the de- 
termining factors. To one who has studied geog- 
raphy aright, it is unnecessary to explain why 
cranberries are grown on Cape Cod, tobacco in 
the Red Sandstone Valley of the Connecticut, 
rice in South Carolina, or wheat in Minnesota; or 
‘why locomotives are made in Philadelphia, plate 
glass in Pittsburg, furniture in Grand Rapids, 
cotton goods in Birmingham, or pottery in Tren- 
ton. Suffice it to say, that industries slowly but 
surely spring up in the regions well suited to their, 
development. Frequently, where conditions are 
adverse,’men triumph over nature’s barriers to 
civilization, as when they tunnel mountains, con- 
nect oceans with watery threads, turn the course 
of rivers and moisten arid lands. Nature deals 
out her wealth with moderation in temperate 
* zones and to them only who would ‘‘subdue and 
have dominion’’ over her. Life is dear because 
it has beer purchased by incessant toil, and it is 
versatile and abundant because in the struggle it
-P-A-G-E-118
  116 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
acquired knowledge, sympathy, judgment and 
mercy. 
The trend of industrial history is determined 
by physiographic conditions. Man can modify his 
environment but he cannot annihilate it. In gen- 
eral, prosperity is coincident with a wise adjust- 
ment to geographic conditions. Chief among these 
are climate and soils, of which much has been 
said. But land forms, themselves, exert impor- 
tant controls over industrial life. A general dis- 
tribution of mountain ranges parallel to seas 
makes narrow coastal plains; close parallel 
ranges enclose inter-montane valleys; in the 
midst of the sea voleanic disturbances project 
habitable lands; the subsidence of continental 
margins is responsible for numerous head-lands 
and adjacent islands; and great rivers build and 
moisten far-reaching food plains. Hence it is 
that these earth processes fashion restricted hab- 
itable areas, while unrestricted areas result from 
the evaporation of large water bodies, or from 
the diastrophic tilting or lifting of extensive sea- 
floors. Broadly speaking, habitable lands are re- 
stricted or unrestricted and a review of industrial 
life makes the following inductions possible: (1) 
Restricted habitable areas determine industries 
in which a maximum of labor is expended in the 
production of a minimum.of material. (2) Con- 
versely, unrestricted habitable areas determine in- 
dustries in which a minimum of labor is expended 
in the production of a maximum of material. 
The operation of this principle is reflected in 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE 117 
the character of the people. The Norwegians, 
hemmed in between the mountains and the ocean, 
were long dependent upon the fishing industry, 
and years at sea developed them into the boldest 
and most famous of seamen. 
When a yard of Belgian hand-made point lace 
is sold, ninety-five per cent. of the purchase price 
is for labor; the value of the raw material used is 
insignificant. In order that nearly five hundred 
people may live on a square mile, the highest pos- 
sible utility must be given every production, by 
the expenditure of much labor upon little mate- 
rial. In Switzerland, where metals and woods 
are scarce, hand-made watches and ingeniously 
earved toys illustrate how limited quantities of 
raw material may be transformed into great value 
through the application of much industry. Un- 
usual skill, strict economy and extreme persever- 
ance are the characteristic responses in the people. 
Restricted tillable areas near Boston and New 
York stimulate truck-farming, because an acre so 
employed furnishes a maximum of labor, the com- 
pensation for which comes when a limited quan- 
tity of choice seasonable vegetables finds a ready 
market. 
Not only to industrial life does the principle 
relating to restricted areas apply; it extends also 
to political history with most decisive results. 
As England’s tillable lands are much restricted, 
her own soils have long been unable to support 
her rapidly increasing population. In 1815 the 
Corn Law was passed to protect the English land-
-P-A-G-E-120
    118 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
lord. Under this obnoxious measure, the price of 
wheat in 1817 reached $3.25 a bushel, and the 
same year the weekly wage of a weaver was $1.02. 
The struggle for free trade soon followed. The 
exorbitant price of wheat added to the misery of 
the under-fed laborer, and the tariff interfered 
with commerce. Manufacturers demanded free 
trade because they saw clearly that a more abun- 
dant food supply would increase the spirit and 
efficiency of the workmen, and would also tend 
to keep labor cheap. Had England’s territory 
been sufficient to furnish food for her millions, 
the great political struggle that wrenched the 
very life of England might have been averted. 
The misery, suffering, and abject poverty of the 
people enlisted the sympathy of noble hearts, who 
condemned the evil condition where ‘‘wealth ac- 
cumulates and men decay.’’ Poets, reformers, 
and statesmen championed the cause of suffering 
humanity, and finally, in 1846, Robert Peel, 
through motives altruistic or otherwise, deserted 
the Tories and introduced the bill which sealed 
the doom of the Corn Law and marked the begin- 
ning of free trade in England. So in America, 
geography is peculiarly interwoven with history. 
The coastal plains, with their rich soils and warm, 
moist climate, must answer for the Civil War, says 
Prof. Davis, for these conditions made slavery 
profitable. Ultimately, the economic resources of 
the South were responsible for the direful indus- 
trial situation there following the war. 
In areas where the resources are less restricted,
-P-A-G-E-121
  GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE 119 
the industrial problem is very different. In con- 
trast to the Swiss, who makes a few ounces of 
metal into a watch worth ten dollars, or the Bel- 
gian, who converts a handful of flax into a yard 
of point lace worth its weight in gold, the Penn- 
sylvanian makes from his almost unrestricted re- 
sources, iron and coal, locomotives and steel rails. 
The problem of the Illinois farmer is the produc- 
tion of a maximum yield with the minimum in- 
vestment of labor. A load of corn which brings 
$25 shows at least a return of $20 for material 
and the balance for labor. Dealing, as he does, 
with produce in great bulk, he becomes wasteful 
and extravagant. If, instead of Illinois’ eighty 
people to the square mile, it had Belgium’s four 
hundred and ninety, no longer could ‘‘half a til- 
lage stint’? our prairie plains. No half-tilled 
farms, no weedy fence corners, no peaty swamps 
or alkaline tracts could then exist. Agriculture in 
the past has been easy. Owing to its great possi- 
bilities ‘‘man has had only to tickle the soil with 
the plow and it has laughed with a harvest.’’? But 
in his greed to get bountiful returns with little 
outlay of labor and capital, man is fast reaching 
a point of diminishing returns. Because of re- 
duced fertility, a point is reached at which a given 
outlay of labor and capital fails to produce a pro- 
portionate yield. Here the study of geography 
touches life most directly. It is only through an 
understanding of soils, and a knowledge of the 
treatment by. which their fertility can be main- 
tained, that this point of diminishing returns can
-P-A-G-E-122
  120 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
be pushed farther into the future. So the agri 
cultural college becomes a necessity, and the call- 
ing of the scientist is dignified by his reduction 
of farming to scientific agriculture. 
Has too much been said concerning the influ- 
ence of geography upon life, and too little con- 
‘cerning the value of the study of geography as 
presented in our schools? The educational tend- 
ency is emphatically toward a training that 
touches life in practical, rational, and vital ways; 
hence the value of any study must be measured 
by its contribution to fulness of life. That man 
is best educated who best understands his environ- 
ment, who most clearly recognizes his relation- 
ships and responsibilities to all other life, and 
who best uses his resources to promote the com- 
mon weal. Every science deals with some phase 
of man’s environment, and geography, which is a 
department of science, deals in a general way 
with the same subject-matter. Any study which 
aids in giving man the correct view of his place 
in nature is of great value either from the prac- 
tical or the cultural point of view; for, indeed, 
culture, to be worthy the name, must manifest 
itself in the every day life of a people. 
The revelation of truth is one of the chief func- 
tions of all education. Superstition and tradition 
have ever blocked progress. Geography has as- 
sumed its share in the task of disseminating 
knowledge. A Genoese visionary, starting out to 
prove the rotundity of the earth, discovered a new 
world; Magellan consummated the unfinished task
-P-A-G-E-123
GEOGRAPHY AND LIFE 121 
of circumnavigating the globe. The next great 
triumph of truth came in the middle of the six- 
teenth century, when Copernicus bequeathed to 
science a solar system. With the contributions of 
Herschel, Laplace, Ritter, and Guyot, we might 
think the work of geography complete. But again 
comes the question more pointed and specific: 
‘‘How can I, at the country cross-roads, influence 
life and character through geography?’’ Seek the 
answer in this: if men and women of the next gen- 
eration shall be filled with ‘‘wisdom and under- 
standing’’; and if they shall be free from the 
bondage of superstitions that distort and terrify 
life, then must the children of today be convinced 
that moons neither help nor hinder the growth of 
plants, nor affect the amount of rainfall; that 
soils, the chief source of man’s wealth, are the re- 
positories of plant-foods which unwise use may 
exhaust all too soon; that cyclones possess decided 
economic value since to them we are chiefly in- 
debted for our copious rains; that the ‘‘magician 
chlorophyll, conjuring with sunbeams,’’ breathes 
life into dead matter and makes an animal king- 
dom possible; that birds and bees labor inces- 
santly in making, man’s harvest abundant; that 
the chief use of the earth-worm is not to veneer a 
fish-hook, but to enhance the resources of the soil 
by keeping it rich and porous; that even invisible 
organisms render the highest service to man, as 
when bacteria accomplish the fixation of nitrogen 
in leguminous plants; and finally, that the forest, 
the nature-given heritage which man has so wan- 
iJ 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  122 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
tonly devastated, serves man directly in a score of 
ways, and indirectly enriches and protects the 
soils, prevents disastrous floods, secures constant 
heads to our streams, breaks the biting blasts of 
winter, and makes beautiful, landscapes that 
otherwise would be barren and monotonous. 
Even above the value of practical knowledge, 
the student of nature may discover the steadfast- 
ness and immutability of God’s law. He may be 
convinced that retribution follows its transgres- 
sion, in the physical as in the spiritual world, with 
unfailing certainty; and finally, that to him who 
is in harmony with nature, and therefore most 
likely to be ‘‘in tune with the Infinite,’’ shail come 
“length of days, riches, and honor.’’

ject of geography. The same argument, how- 
ever, may be advanced for many other sub- 
jects, though of all elementary-school subjects, 
geography requires the greatest range of insight 
and information. It should be clearly kept in 
mind that the marginal subject-matter which ar- 
ticulates geography with these various subjects, 
is as truly geographical as it is physical or so- 
ciological, and therefore geography ‘‘borrows’’ 
no more from these subjects than they ‘‘borrow’’ 
from it. (See Fig. 1, p. 57.) The tests which de- 
termine whether material is geographic are:     
      
      
   
  (a) Does it contribute in any way to the corre- 
lation of life with physical environment or, as Pro- 
fessor W. M. Davis puts it, of the physiographic 
and ontographic factors of the subject? 
(b) Is it necessary to an understanding of con- 
trols and responses? 
(c) Is the material in question directly or in- 
directly ‘‘earth-determined?’ 
Such tests are necessary to keep the teacher 
from unconsciously drifting into a discussion of 
irrelevant matter, a dangerous tendency which 
even very earnest teachers sometimes find difficult 
to avoid. It is a matter of extreme importance, 
however, for the teacher to be constantly on his 
guard against this common weakness. 
One of the first requisites, then, is that the
-P-A-G-E-129
THE TEACHER'S PREPARATION £7 
teacher shall recognize the limits of the geographi- 
eal field, and thereby always direct his teaching to 
purposeful ends. 
If we look now to the subject-matter within the 
proper limits of geography, we shall find it made 
up of countless facts and details from which schol- 
ars have induced laws and principles. It is with 
this material that the teacher must deal, using the 
facts not alone as ends in themselves, but as the 
raw material or data from which general princi- 
ples are to be derived. 
I. A knowledge of the great physiographic 
processes is fundamental to the teacher’s equip- 
ment. Without their comprehension he sees only 
“fas through a glass darkly.’’ It is often observed 
in normal-school classes and in institutes, that 
many teachers are wholly ignorant of these 
processes, and since this is true, no comprehen- 
sion of the life history of continents is possible. 
For the benefit of those whose opportunities have 
been somewhat limited, a short exposition of these 
processes is given. Experienced teachers should 
always keep them within the field of conscious 
knowledge and use them as directive and correla- 
tive factors. The physiographic processes are 
(a) diastrophism, (b) vulcanism, and (c) grada- 
tion. : 
In addition to these and as a result of their in- 
teraction, we have the unit of terrestrial life-his- 
tory, the cycle. 
* For fuller discussion of the comparative values of facts and prix 
cinles see Chapter XIV.  
-P-A-G-E-130
  128 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
(a) Diastrophism is the uplift or subsidence of 
any portion of the earth’s crust, or lithosphere. 
The earth’s crust under the influence of gravity, 
tends to invest the contracting centrosphere, or 
central core. This tendency causes the crust to 
subside slowly in various regions, and the subsi- 
dence is often accompanied by ering or folding 
in other regions. Hither movement is dias- 
trophic. If a sheet of paper be laid on the table 
top and held at both ends with some ‘‘fulness,’’ 
any attempt to smooth out the fulness, will cause it 
to appear in a different place. So when sub- 
sidence occurs in one region, uplift may appear 
in another. 
It is through this process of diastrophism that 
sea-bottoms are lifted and large land masses born. 
All parts of the earth have at some time been 
under water, and many portions have oscillated 
from land to sea many times, as is attested by the 
rocks and sediments exposed at the surface. 
Plateaus and mountains are often the result of 
the arching, folding, and faulting of the earth’s 
crust. 
But this process is not a matter of history only ; 
it is a dynamic force now, operating slowly in 
many portions of the earth. Time was when our 
own continent was an elongated island reaching 
from Labrador to Georgia. The Rocky mountains 
were then lifted; and by slow upward movement 
and numerous subsidences, the bed of the Paleo- 
zoic sea finally came to the surface, causing its 
waters to recede respectively toward the Arctic  
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 129 
ocean and Gulf of Mexico. <A subsidence of 975 
ft. would again unite these bodies of water and 
split the continent. 
Continental oscillations are best observed at 
the margins of continents.* Examine a good map 
of North America and note the eastern edge of 
the continental shell; this was once the margin of 
our continent. Again observe the fall-line sepa- 
rating the Piedmont from the Coastal plains. This 
was once the continental margin. Is it not easy 
to comprehend that sufficient subsidence would 
again permit the surf to reach Washington, Rich- 
mond and Columbia? 
Let us now see*the practical significance of the 
sinking or the rising of coasts. The coast of 
eastern North America is at present slowly 
subsiding. The movement is more pronounced 
north of Cape Hatteras. South of this point, the 
characteristics are those of a recently uplifted 
coast, though a slight subsidence is now observed. 
Note the irregularity of the coast line, the numer- 
ous drowned river valleys and more pronounced 
bays» Compare with the coast of South Carolina 
and Georgia, and note the evenness of the coast- 
line and the absence.of important bays. In which 
division are good harbors more numerous? The 
great commercial cities of the northern division 
are inland, at the bay-heads; in the south they are 
on the coast. Which type of coast has been more 
favorable to industrial development? 
In general, there are two types of coasts—the 
* See The Margin of Our Continent, North Amer‘ca, Russell.
-P-A-G-E-132
  130 THE LEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
rising and sinking, of which the sections pointed 
out will serve as examples. Also, in a general 
way, a ragged contour with deep inlets, suggests 
subsidence, and even shore lines, like the east 
coast of South America, suggest uplift. But rag- 
ged and indented coasts may now be rising, and 
even coasts may be sinking, the reverse movement 
in each case having preceded. Pupils can infer 
from maps the great movements that have oc- 
eurred. Thus the lands in general, with their 
mountains, plateaus, lake basins and_ typical 
shore lines, are often determined by diastrophism 
alone; sometimes by this process working in con- 
junction with the others mentioned. 
(b) Vulcanism is the ejection of the interior ma- 
terials of the earth upon the surface. The causes 
of this action are-not very clearly understood. The 
process assists diastrophism in building land 
masses. The inner materials are ejected either 
through craters or through fissures in the earth’s 
erust. When through craters, voleanic cones are 
formed; when through fissures, dykes or vuleanic 
plateaus. Mt. Shasta is an example of the former, 
Columbia Plateau of the latter. Vuleanic action 
often occurs in the sea, when islands are formed. 
The Philippines, the islands of the Japan Empire, 
and the Hawaiian Islands are of vulcanic origin. 
Hence vuleanism also tends to make lands and in- 
crease altitudes above the level of the sea. The 
general elevation of large regions of the west has 
been increased in this manner. Successive lava 
flows in Washington and Oregon have produced 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 131 
vulcanic rock of great thickness, as is shown in the 
cafion of the Snake River in southeastern Wash- 
ington. 
Diastrophic uplift and vuleanism tend to make 
lands and increase their altitudes. Subsidence 
tends to submerge the lower lands. 
(c) Gradation is that process by which winds, 
water, and glaciers, assisted by other physical and 
chemical forces, tend to restore the lands to sea 
level. Gradation, then, works against diastrophic 
uplift and vulcanism, and establishes, on a magnifi- 
cent scale, a universal conflict. Slowly mountains 
and hills yield to the action of weather, the loose 
materials are carried by gravity, winds, glaciers 
or water, toward and into the sea, thus reducing 
the altitude and sculpturing the land surface with 
valleys, gorges and cafions. The moisture that 
falls on mountain crests is always planing away 
the slopes and ultimately only a gentle divide will 
mark the location of the old range. This degrad- 
ing process ends when the rivers cut their chan- 
nels to sea-level and so lose their ability to do the 
work of transportation. 
The cycle* is a term inclusive of all of the 
changes wrought by the physiographic processes 
in uplifting a region and subsequently reducing it 
to sea level. Its conception is the most significant 
in the whole physiographic side of geography, and 
no teacher has made a beginning until the idea is 
grasped in its entirety. 
The teacher’s intellectual equipment, then, will

vary directly according to the number of induc- 
tions or generalizations made, and in saying this, 
we incidentally give the detailed fact-side of sub- 
ject matter its rating. For further illustration, 
several inductions are here given. If the teacher 
can elaborate fully, and apply these and many 
similar ones, it will speak well for his geographical 
equipment. 
1. Cyclonic storms are of economic value to 
the Upper Mississippi Valley. 
2. Rivers are enemies of lakes. 
3. Increased population necessitates. intensi- 
» fied industry. 
’ 4. Rotation of crops does not increase fertility 
of soil. 
5. In our latitude, west coasts are warmer. 
6. Glaciated areas abound in lakes. 
7. The temperature varies with the altitude of 
the sun. 
8. Cities are located at breaks in transporta- 
tion. 
9. The driftless area has a perfect drainage 
system. 
10. Industries are earth determined. 
11. Forests preserve soils, and prevent floods. 
12. Illinois and Iowa are rivals in corn produc- 
tion. Illinois markets much more corn. 
II. A good preparation must include the ability 
to interpret geographical features in one’s own en- 
vironment. How often people are wholly oblivious 
to the interesting features and processes of the
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 133 
neighborhood. This is sometimes true of teachers 
whose ‘‘book knowledge”? is fairly adequate. But 
of what value is any science unless it be applied? 
Geography and nature study should never dete- 
ricrate into mere formalism. Their content is 
concrete and their worth depends upon their ap- 
plication. The wise teacher has an opportunity to 
socialize the materials of geography. Lessons on 
soils may be carried home and the parents taught 
by the children. The farmer may learn of the 
value of legumes in restoring nitrogen to his fields, 
and in this and other ways, the school may become 
a true social center. Should a rural teacher, on 
his way to school, observe that the corn in a cer- 
tain field is of light green or yellowish color, he 
might interpret it to mean insufficient nitrogen in 
the soil, and so advise with the farmer. Should he 
examine the clover roots and find no tubercles he 
could suggest inoculation. 
The teacher who has no love for the stories 
which ‘‘Mother Nature’’ tells and who cannot 
‘‘read as he runs,’’ at least some of the more com- 
mon ones, is not prepared to interest children in 
outdoor geography. On board of train, as one 
passes the dunes in Indiana, cuts through the 
moraines of ‘Illinois or Wisconsin, rounds lakes 
and drumlins, and finally enters a valley walled 
in by the terraced slopes of the Driftless Area, 
what chapters of earth lore should pass through 
his mind and make travel truly a pleasure! 
Suppose again that one passes a stream in Iowa 
and notes that the banks are nearly on a level with

the water as shown in Fig. 2; or crosses the 
Illinois and observes its bluffs and banks 
as in Fig. 3; and finally crossing the Fox 
observes the features of Fig. 4, what interpreta- 
tions will he make explanatory of these varying 
characteristics? And these are familiar and typi- 
cal aspects of the Upper Mississippi valley.

knowledge of books, maps, helps and simple ap-

paratus, useful in his daily work. In order that 
this volume may be helpful, short bibliographies 
are given at the close of each chapter, and occa- 
sional references in the context itself. The teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION 135 
must not only know the sources of information— 
but must know how to use them, as well. The 
chapters on Maps and Models, and Weather 
Study, it is hoped, will be suggestive. 
‘“‘One of the most valuable parts of the geog- 
raphy training is the ability to use reference books 
accurately, easily and effectively. This training 
can readily be given through the use of reference 
books accessible in the school library. Only a few 
reference volumes should be used, and the best 
should be selected not merely because they are in- 
teresting, but primarily because they are geo- 
graphically sound, information giving, and really 
supplementary to the class-room lessons.’’ * 
Without referring especially to teaching ability 
as a part of a teacher’s necessary equipment, this 
being quite fully treated elsewhere, two other 
phases must be noted. These are the life side, and 
the social and economic side. The first could be 
best summed up by saying that the prepared 
teacher should know something of the theory of 
evolution to serve as a guide in dealing with or- 
ganic responses; and from the social side of geog- 
raphy, which includes commercial geography, it 
seems that some knowledge, at least, of political 
economy is absolutely necessary. Production, 
transportation and consumption involve principles 
of economics, an understanding of which adds 
much to the teacher’s efficiency. Both of these 
phases of geography are treated at some length in 
other chapters.

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
General method; how determined; how better method in geography 
may be attained. . 
The empirical method in geography; no lack of inherent interest 
in the subject; the value of well selected problems. 
An illustrative problem; what its solution involves; advantages of 
such procedure, 
If the general method be good, the special 
method can hardly be bad; indeed, the teacher’s 
own ‘‘way of doing’’ things, his personality, must 
count, else he becomes a mere machine and his in- 
struction becomes purely formal. Considerable 
liberty must be assumed in the technique of daily 
lesson plans. 
Again general method should be an outgrowth 
of the nature of the subject. Too often educators 
distort school subjects to exploit some conceived 
method of presentation. But these warped defini- 
tions constitute no panacea for educational prog- 
ress, and surely they do not change the nature of 
school subjects! Whatever is eliminated in school 
subjects must be discarded on the basis of utility, 
not in the narrow sense, but rather of utility as 
a life process.

  THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
° 
General method in geography, then, is a result- 
ant of three components, viz., 
The intrinsic nature of the subject. 
The needs of the individual in his life rela- 
tionships. 
The educative process through which the 
pupil comes into possession of these rela- 
tionships. 
Granting the above theses, reform in general 
method must be wrought through instruction 
whose guiding principles require that— 
a. 
2. os Formal fact teaching be replaced by con- 
erete and significant principles. 
The rational or causal element be more gen- 
erally recognized. 
Materials be more fully evaluated and use- 
ful types selected. 
The social phase receive more emphasis. 
Subject matter be presented in form of per- 
tinent problems which pupils are to solve. 
Only the last point will be discussed since the 
first four deal with the selection and emphasis of 
materials rather than presentation of matter. 
That the teaching of geography suffers much as 
a result of unscientific method is readily admitted 
by all thoughtful students of the subject. A more 
general use of geographical readers and maga- 
zines, of well selected illustrative materials, to- 
gether with the vividness and concreteness result- 
ing from well conducted excursions, are of great 
 
-P-A-G-E-141

value in. giving new life and interest to the work. 
The old and established method of telling the 
facts of the science in the laconic statements of the 
brief text-book, is at best but a mild way of stimu- 
lating mental activity. This latter method pours 
a great profusion of generalized statements into 
the mental hopper, but furnishes little motive for 
their screening, milling and sifting. To receive 
and to retain are the assumed aims of this un- 
scientific or empirical method. 
To make the above clear, one or two parallels 
are drawn. What interest would the study of 
arithmetic excite, should the author solve all of 
the problems and present the written solutions for 
pupils to study? What demands would such pro- 
cedure make upon the mind of the pupil? The best 
teachers of mathematics condemn the time-hon- 
ored custom of authors of geometry because too 
much of the work is done for the student. 
What of the method of teaching geography? 
Even with the recent awakening to the possibili- 
ties of the subject and the somewhat improved 
methods of presentation, the results are not com- 
mensurate with the expense of time and effort. 
Ought not the same general method to apply to 
geography as applies to mathematics and science? 
Cannot the essentials be brought to the pupils in 
the form of pertinent problems which they are to 
solve? i 
In their life experience, all are interested in 
geography. Problems of production, transporta- 
tion and consumption—one or all—affect every
-P-A-G-E-142
  140 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
individual. Problems of agriculture, forestry, ir- 
rigation and road-building command universal in- 
terest and attention, yet, withal, the study of geog- 
_ raphy is generally formal and empirical. The dif- 
ficulty lies in the fact that the presentation is un- 
pedagogical; surely the subject matter is interest- 
ing. If pertinent problems could be so presented 
to pupils, that their solutions would necessitate the 
interpretation of good maps, charts and graphs; 
the reading and sifting of selected’ articles in 
newspapers and periodicals; the comparison of 
statements in texts and reference books and the 
selection of a ‘‘consensus of opinion’’; and the 
expression of results by means of maps, models, 
graphs and written essays, it seems that the whole 
situation might be changed for the better. Instead 
of being mere recipients, pupils would then be ~ 
forced to read carefully; to: reason, interpret, 
infer and to express. The true spirit of a student 
might be engendered by a procedure that rejects 
brief and unqualified statements and requires 
pupils to compare authorities, to examine ‘‘the 
planes of cleavage’’ and, therefore, to modify first 
impressions. 
A suggestive problem suitable for the higher 
grades j is here given. It is the Cnet ovetls of actual 
experience in teaching. 
Prostem: What water body furnishes much 
of the moisture of the corn and wheat states?

' teaching was done except that necessary to lead to 
an understanding of the particular problem in 
hand. The only materials used in this case were 
the Natural Advanced Geography and the daily 
‘Weather Maps. The small maps in the geography 
were very helpful. 
1. What transports moisture from seas to the 
land? Why does it often rain, on the windward 
sides of the mountains? What causes precipita- 
tion? How, then, does the upward movement of 
the air affect its temperature? 
2. What is the general direction of the wind 
in the regions of the corn and wheat states? (Chil- 
dren are referred to the wind charts in the geog-

of each.)

moisture from the Pacific Ocean to the corn and 
wheat states? Why? (Verbatim written answer

moisture to the wheat and corn growing states be- 
cause as they cross the Rocky Mountains they get 
chilled and drop their moisture before they get to 
the wheat and corn growing states.’’)

of cyclonic storms. How does the storm affect the 
surrounding air currents? In what direction does 
the wind blow to the north of the storm-center? 
West? East? South? (Teacher here developed 
few salient points concerning the cyclonic storms, 
but only facts here needed.) In what direction 
does the air move in small whirl-winds?) When air 
rises how is its temperature affected? What would 
occur if large volumes of warm moist air should 
rise? 
7. What change in temperature will occur in 
the winds that reach the storm center from the 
north? Will these winds absorb or deposit moist- 
ure? , (Pupil’s answer: The winds from the Hud- 
son Bay are cold and as they go farther south they 
get warmer and keep their moisture.) 
8. Can the winds that reach the storm center 
from the east bring much moisture? Why? (Im- 
agine storm center to be in central Iowa.) Com- 
pare with winds from west. 
9. The winds that reach the storm center from 
the south cross what water body? Consult tem- 
perature chart and compare the temperature of 
the Gulf Coast with Iowa. (Motive for learning 
isotherms.) What change will occur in tempera- 
ture of winds that reach storm center from the 
south? Will these winds deposit or absorb moist- 
ure? (Weather maps showing storm centers in

that cloud and rain areas are to south and east of

months. Real conditions should be observed. 
10. What indicates approach of storm from 
west? Observe temperature. Condition of sky, 
rainfall (if any) that accompany a southeast wind. 
Observe same conditions as winds shift to west. 
Repeat observations. What winds bring most 
rain? What water body does this wind cross? 
11. What water body, then, is of the greatest _ 
value in furnishing. moisture to the wheat and 
corn states? How did the cyclone help in bringing 
the moisture? 
The introduction of problems in geography 
serves to focalize the attention for some time upon 
an important question. It furnishes definite mo- 
tives which guide the pupil in his study. The solu- 
tion of problems assists much in the organization 
of geographical facts, reduces formal work to a 
minimum, emphasizes the value of ideas, sub- 
stitutes active investigation for passive reception, 
and, in a general way, trains the pupil in genuine 
habits of study. :

An Inpvuctrive Lesson in GuoGRaPHY. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
How the inductive procedure applies in geography; danger vf 
waste in use of data; induction may require time; relation 
of induction to deduction, 
A lesson planned; problem; preparation; presentation; compari- 
son; generalization. 
The lesson taught; steps taken by pupils; results obtained. 
The lessons in geography are largely inductive. 
This is particularly true of the work in the inter- 
mediate grades. It may be observed, however, 
that the method is not strictly scientific. The 
movement is slow. Often data, in the form of 
detailed fact or item, is gathered and held for . 
some time before comparison and generalization 
can be accomplished. Often, too, in the text books 
of geography, much information of rather diverse 
nature, is presented with no very clearly defined 
end in view. It is incumbent upon the teacher 
to gather this material about definite centers and 
to use it in inducing general laws or principles. 
Often, however, months elapse before children 
shall have gathered sufficient data around some 
center, to make an induction safe. Teachers 
should realize that much of the observational and 
145 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  146 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
descriptive work has for its motive the collection 
of data, the assemblage of facts, the recollection 
and comparison of last month’s or even last year’s 
materials, for the express purpose of establishing 
general principles. Otherwise the work is pur- 
poseless and empirical, that is, it is done on the 
assumption that somehow, somewhere, sometime, 
it will fit into the child’s experience in a helpful 
way. And, indeed, it may, but it will be by mere 
accident in some particular case. It is safe to say 
that, unless it be the conscious purpose of the 
teacher to use this material to a wise end, a great 
waste in education will result. 
Although the chief movement in lower grade 
geography is inductive, there are not many lessons 
that can be consummated by the more direct in- 
ductive process. For instance, the notion of the 
world as a whole is reached inductively, but only 
after a whole year of reconnoitering journeys to 
different parts of the globe. These journeys are 
suggested by home needs, and the industries and 
materials by which the needs are satisfied, furnish 
motives for an introductory study of Brazil as a 
coffee-producing country; of France as a. silk- 
producing country; of the Philippine Islands as a 
manila hemp and sugar-producing region; and of 
South Africa as a diamond-producing country. 
Thus, little by little, the pupil comes into posses- 
sion of a series of conceptions, the last of which 
is the ‘‘world as a whole.’’ 
Induction, then, seems to be the natural pro- 
cedure in the early work of geography. But this
-P-A-G-E-149

process of learning is no end in itself. Neither 
can it be separated from deduction, which may be 
termed the inverse inductive procedure. The 
writer conceives these educative processes to be 
reciprocally related; that is, the inductive method 
narrows down to the general, while the deductive 
spreads out to cover the particular.

It is not thought that special effort will be made 
by teachers to make the lessons in geography show 
the ear-marks of method, but it is believed that 
skillful teaching will naturally follow these 
methods of procedure. Indeed, the teacher’s 
method will become an unconscious guide, if the 
principles of teaching have been fully assimilated. 
Deduction, then, is the fruit of the inductive 
process. It can hardly be called a process by 
itself, but is rather the application of the general 
_ principle to which induction led. Without deduc- 
tion the process of learning might become very 
slow and tedious. Its application is a more direct 
method of securing results, and is, therefore, an 
economical procedure in the learning process. It 
seems to be a natural mental movement.

  148 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
In any development lesson the art of question- 
ing is of fundamental importance, for through the 
questions the whole method-movement is deter- 
mined. The questions not only point the way, but 
they must be put in a manner that will relate new 
and old data, suggest likenesses and differences 
and weld together all statements pertinent to the 
problem in hand. i 
Again the movement of either inductive or de- 
ductive lessons must be such as to call for some 
original thinking. All apt questions in develop- 
ment lessons will call for initiative on the part of, 
pupils. The central problem for the teacher is 
“chow best to stimulate the constructive thinking 
of the pupils of the class; how to induce in them 
the most educative self-activity.’’* 
This getting together of data for the discovery 
of a principle, or later, the application of the 
principle to new cases, involves the comprehension 
of relationships, which are the essential elements 
of problems. 
The following lesson illustrative of the inductive 
lesson is not given as a ‘‘model.’’ It was planned 
and taught, at the suggestion of the author, by 
Professor Thomas H. Gentle, for the sole purpose 
of testing the inductive method. The condition 
and the class were average only. The observation 
of the lesson illustrated one thing clearly, viz., that 
a well planned lesson in the hands of a good 
teacher can stimulate a large amount of original

thought ; involve a large amount of significant sub- 
ject-matter; and direct the minds of pupils to the 
understanding of an important generalization. 
A short synopsis of the plan is here given. 
AN ILLUSTRATIVE INDUCTIVE LESSON. 
(Planned for a Seventh Grade.) 
Geographical principle to be induced: ‘‘The 
location of cities is often caused by breaks in 
transportation.”’ 
I, PREPARATION. 
What is the chief product of our home region? 
To what place is it shipped? How? South- 
western Wisconsin once produced much lead. 
Where was it taken? Why taken to Galena? 
How? What did the people of Galena do with the 
lead? Where is Galena? Show it onthe map. On 
what river is it located? Why not located at the 
mouth of La Fevre river? Why not at its source? 
What determined how far up the river Galena 
should be located? Then what determined the 
location of Galena? 
‘What supplies were needed in the region of 
Platteville in early days? Where did the supplies 
come from? By what route? Trace the route. 
' What was done with the supplies when they had 
been taken as far by boat as possible? What 
might this transferring point become? 
A few days ago we learned that’ New York is 
the richest city in America. Where is New York 
City located? Point to it on the map.
-P-A-G-E-152
  150 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
Pupils’ problem No. 1. Let us find out how 
New York City came to be located at the mouth 
of the Hudson river. 
PRESENTATION. 
From what place did the first settlers of New 
York come? How did they come? Were their 
ships large? Could they easily sail up the river? 
Why not? Who inhabited this region when the 
white men came? How did the Indian get his 
living? Did he have any products which the white 
men might want? What? Where could the white 
man sell the furs? What could he give the Indian 
in exchange for them? Where were the ‘‘trinkets’’ 
secured? How could the Indians get their furs 
to the white men? Could the white men reach 
the Indians in the ocean ship? Could the Indians 
reach the ocean ships in their canoes? Where, 
then, could the white men and Indians best meet 
to trade? What might you call such a point? 
What do we find there today? Then what deter- 
mined the location of New York City? 
II, PREPARATION. 
How many have ever been to the Mississippi 
river? What did you see while there? (Steam- 
boat.) Where was it going? Is St. Paul a large 
city? With what was the boat loaded? Did you 
notice any railroads near the river? How many? 
Did they have anything to do with the decrease
-P-A-G-E-153
  INDUCTIVE LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY 151 
  
  of river traffic? How so? Where is St. Paul 
located? Point to it on the map. 
Pupils’ problem No. 2. Let us find out why 
St. Paul is. located where it is.     
PRESENTATION. 
Who formerly lived in the region about St. 
Paul? Why? What attracted white people? 
From what direction did the white fur traders 
come? Did the white traders and the Indians 
have definite meeting places? Point out one on 
the map. Why there? What might we call this 
point? How did the traders procure the furs? 
What did they give the Indians in return? Show 
on the map how the traders returned from the 
region. 
Later, lumbermen and settlers came into the 
country about St. Paul. What did these people 
_ need to carry on their work? How could the sup- 
plies reach them? Trace the route on the map. 
What might you call the transferring point? 
How, then, was this point located? 
Ill, PREPARATION. 
How many have ever visited Chicago? Name 
interesting things you saw there. Here is a large 
map of Illinois. Find the Chicago river. Locate 
the city. 
Pupils’ problem No. 3. Let us find out why 
Chicago was located at this place.  
-P-A-G-E-154
  152 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
PRESENTATION. 
A long time ago a missionary visited the Missis- 
sippi valley. He died where Chicago now stands. 
You learned about him in the fourth grade. Who 
was he? Tell about his journey to the Mississippi 
river. Some years after, a French trader came to 
the mouth of the Chicago river and bought a cabin 
which he found there. Was it an excellent 
place for fur trade? Why? From what region 
could he collect furs? How could the Indians 
bring them to him? Where could he dispose of 
them? How could he send them away? What did 
this make of the point where the trader lived? 
What made the post grow larger? 
From what regions do railroads now enter Chi- 
cago?’ Why are they needed? What do they 
earry to the city? What do they take away? Does 
this trade make the city grow?) Why? 
IV. COMPARISON AND GENERALIZATION. 
Let us now compare these three places which we 
have studied, to see if we can find one thing true 
of all of them. 
In the case of New York what were the white 
men forced to do with the supplies and trinkets 
they brought to the region for the settlers and the 
Indians? (Land them.) What did the Indian 
have to do with his furs? Could he carry them 
further than the mouth of the Hudson river? In 
this regard examine both St. Paul and Chicago. 
What do we find true of all?
-P-A-G-E-155
  INDUCTIVE LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY 153 
At this point the pupils will give a crude general 
statement, possibly something like this: 
““In each case we see that the white trader 
brought his things as far as he could without 
unloading and that the Indian brought his furs as 
near the trader as he could without unloading. 
These points were near together. Between them 
a trading post was made and later a town grew.”’ 
The following questions may be asked about the 
general statement in order to throw it into the 
technical form: 
What obstruction, then, intervened in the routes 
of transportation for the white man’s goods? The 
Indian’s routes? (Breaks.) What do breaks in 
transportation cause? What determined the loca- 
tion of New York City?) Why has it since become 
so large? What determined the location of St. 
Paul? Of Chicago? Why have they become large 
cities? What sometimes determines the location 
of cities? 
If it is decided (and it is almost mandatory) to 
earry this principle through its deductive phase, 
the mode of procedure may be seen in the Deduc- 
tive Lesson in the next chapter.

A Depuctive Devetopment Lesson, 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The deductive development lesson; steps: (a) the securing of 
data, (b) the recalling of principles, (c) the making of 
inferences, and (d) the verifying of inferences. 
A deductive lesson presupposes the possession 
of general notions or principles, for without their 
use a deductive procedure is impossible. Hence 
deductive lessons follow the inductive and form 
the application of the induced principle. The gen- 
eral notion plays an important role in geographi- 
cal study since it is a sort of ‘‘try square’’ by 
which we take the measure, as it were, of the new 
material. If the ‘‘fit’’ seems fairly satisfactory, | 
we make an inference which is quite likely to be 
correct. Verification can be made by reference to | 
text or reference books. The deductive lesson is 
a short cut and therefore rapid and economical. It 
incidentally affords drill on already comprehended 
principles. 
A careful study of the following lesson will show 
clearly the movement of a deductive lesson. 
Prostem: Why is the winter temperature on 
the coast of Washington and Oregon so warm?

I. EXERCISE TO SECURE DATA. 
1. Locate these states on a good political map. 
What is the latitude of Portland, Oregon? Com- 
pare with latitude of Portland, Maine. Compare 
the latitude of Seattle with the latitude of Duluth, 
Minnesota. With Moscow, Russia. 
2. From an isothermic chart (if not found in 
the geography, Longman’s New School Atlas will 
furnish the data) find the January isotherm for 
Portland, Oregon? For Portland, Maine? Which 
is warmer? How many degrees? In like manner 
compare Seattle, Washington, with Duluth, Min- 
nesota.: Compare the January temperatures of 
Seattle and Quebec. Of Seattle and Moscow, Rus- 
sia. Of Duluth and Moscow. 
3. From a good relief map of United States, 
determine the altitude of Seattle. Compare with © 
the altitude of Duluth. Compare with the altitude 
of Portland, Oregon, and Portland, Maine. In 
either case is there much difference? What is the 
altitude of Moscow? 
4. From a good temperature chart find the an- 
nual range in temperature for Seattle, for Port- 
land, Oregon, for Duluth, and for Portland, 
Maine. Compare the July temperatures of Seat- 
tle and Duluth. Of the two Portlands, which has 
the greater differences between January and July 
temperatures? 
5. From a rain chart determine the annual pre- 
cipitation in each of the above cities. What is the 
annual rainfall in Seattle? In Duluth?’ In Que-

bec? Read your text to determine, if possible, if 
the moisture in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle is 
distributed throughout the year or precipitated in 
a certain season? (The rainfall lessons may here 
be recalled.) Is the rainfall distributed through- 
out the year in Duluth? In Portland, Maine? 
From the relief map show that the conditions 
favor heavy winter rains at Seattle. 
6. What are the prevailing winds of Portland, 
Oregon, and of Seattle? Of Duluth? Of Quebec! 
Of Portland, Maine? Of Moscow? 
7. Note carefully the location of each of these 
cities with reference to large water-bodies. 
II. REVIEW TO RECALL PRINCIPLES. 
1. Other things being equal, do changes in lati- 
tude cause changes in climatic temperature? In 
this case can you attribute differences in winter 
temperature to differences in latitude? 
2. What effect does altitude have upon tem- 
perature? Could the difference in winter temper- 
ature between the Portlands be due to altitude? 
Could the difference in the case of Seattle and 
Duluth be due to altitude? Answer for Seattle 
and Moscow. In comparing the winter tempera- 
tures of Seattle and Portland, Oregon, with Du- 
luth, and Portland, Maine, respectively, can you 
attribute differences to variations in altitude? 
3. What effect do water bodies have on the 
winter temperatures of adjacent lands? What 
medium transports heat in winter from sea to 
land? Make a small sketch map of Western Ore-

gon and Washington including the region of the 
Caseade Mountains. Show by arrows the direc- 
tion of the winter winds that blow from the Pacific 
Ocean over this region. Are the conditions favor- 
able for making the winter climate warmer? Make 
small sketch maps of Duluth and Portland, 
Maine, and insert the arrows to show wind direc- 
tions. In the case of Duluth do the conditions 
favor a higher winter temperature? In the case 
of Portland, Maine? For a comparatively high 
winter temperature in the latitude of Seattle 
should a region be on the east or west side of a 
water body? 
4. How does condensing steam affect adjacent 
bodies? Where does the heat come from? How 
do freezing water bodies affect adjacent lands? 
When the moisture of clouds condenses, is heat 
set free? What effect, then, will daily rains have 
on the temperature of a region? 
Ill) MAKE THE INFERENCES, 
The comparatively high winter temperature 
on the coast of Washington and Oregon is due: 
J. To the warm winds from the Pacific Ocean 
that bathe the region during the winter months. 
2. To the heat tliat comes from the rapid con- 
densation of moisture, rain falling almost daily. 
IV. VFRIFY THE INFERENCES. 
Consult your text books and select as many 
statements as possible that seem to verify your 
inferences. Refer to a text book on meteorology, 
if possible.

DEDUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 159 
(The ordinary geography, especially the older 
editions, are still teaching the almost preposter- 
ous theory that the Japan current is responsible 
for the high temperature of the Pacific Coast win- 
ters. This theory is untenable as is also its ap- 
plication to the Gulf stream’s influence on the 
western coast of Europe. Prof. Henry Gannett 
of the U. S. Geological Survey denies that the 
Japan current even touches North America, and 
states that such a current, even if it did bathe 
the continent, would not be warm after a journey 
of 6,000 miles in polar seas. See ‘‘Journal of 
Geography,”’’ vol. I, p. 157.)

  CHAPTER XIII. 
RecionaL GrocraPHy. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Geographical facts must be systematized; in studying countries a 
unit must be selected; the physiographic region recommended. 
The advantages of the regional unit; how it helps in organizing 
the materials of geography; its economy over a ean unit; 
summary of argument. 
The selection of material and its elaboration are 
two very important questions which confront 
every teacher of geography. In the matter of 
selection that which is fundamental should guide. 
There is such an unlimited amount of geograph- 
ical material that, unless the teacher deals with 
general principles, he is in danger of being lost in 
the maze of detail. The notion that one must 
know all of the individual facts relating to 
location is not the true test of geographical knowl- 
edge. Geographical information must, in the end, 
be systematized—thrown into general categories 
and linked together by some general principle 
which shall be the basis of organization. If the 
student understands the principle and can give 
concrete illustrations, his knowledge of geography 
may be quite comprehensive, even though there 
may be very many items and facts quite interest- 
160
-P-A-G-E-163
  REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY 161 
ing in themselves, of which he is entirely ignorant. 
In selecting topics for study the teacher must be 
sure that they are characteristic, /far-reaching and 
typical. Whatever he emphasizes should be ap- 
plicable to some other topic. A mere fact which 
cannot be used to explain or give significance to 
some other fact or serve as a datum of induction, 
is only a burden to the mind. In geography, as in 
mathematics, the principle is the all-important 
thing. ‘These principles will appear again and 
again in the study of different topics in different 
regions. When the pupil has mastered the prin- 
ciple, the mere recognition of it will suffice in the 
new topic. One great difficulty which has con- 
fronted the student in the past is the vast number 
of topics which seems to demand treatment. Our 
best scholars have come to recognize the physio- 
graphic region as the best unit for study. Such 
a region is homogeneous in structure and physio- 
graphic controls. It offers the advantage also of 
being, in most cases, a larger unit than one en- 
closed by political boundaries. A physiographic 
region may include several of many political units, 
and instead of making a study of the controls of 
each separate political unit and associating these 
controls in each case with the political unit, the 
study of structure, surface, soil, temperature, and 
winds may be worked out once for all and applied 
to the whole region. Much economy would result 
from a more general recognition of this unit in the 
study of geography. Our newest and best books _ 
study countries by regions, and the advantage

162 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
which comes to teacher and student alike, by use 
of an areal unit in simplifying geographical in- 
formation, is great. The study of the United 
States, for instance, might be centered about eight 
or ten regional studies and by this means much 
more time be given to elaboration than would oth- 
erwise be possible. Facts for their own sake can- 
not always be justified. Elaboration is useful and 
essential in tying together and relating the vari- 
ous factors which have had to do in making the 
earth and its people what they are. Only when 
‘the teacher or student has discovered these fac- 
tors and has traced each one of them carefully to 
see how it has influenced earth or man, and has 
discovered, also, how it has worked with or 
against other forces either natural or human, has 
he carried elaboration as far as it is profitable. 
Principles are not a burden to the mind, but are 
helpful in explaining observed phenomena, and 
are a source of power and of pleasure to the stu- 
dent. Elaborations, if properly made, bring out 
the principle and give it a distinct central setting. 
Details may cluster about this center and be val- 
uable as illustrations, but any one is not indispen- 
sable. Indeed, there are so many facts that it is 
quite impossible for the student to know all, and 
frequently there is but little choice from the 
standpoint of utility which one of several the stu- 
dent should learn. The selection of the larger 
unit of study avoids needless repetition, assists 
in better organization of material, enables a more 
complete elaboration, and permits of a more sci- 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY 163 
entific treatment, since a regional study brings 
the physiographic and ontographic factors into 
the most systematic relationships. R. E. Dodge, 
in speaking of geography for secondary oT 
uses these words: 
“The regional geography of the future will be 
a course taught scientifically and causally, and 
will include a special consideration of the com- 
mercial geography of areas and nations. Thus 
the essential elements of physical geography will 
be taught as a basis for studying the man-and- 
life side of the subject, and physical geography 
will by no means be entirely overthrown. The 
point of view will be different from the point of 
view in reference to that subject held at present. 
Physical geography will not be taught as an end 
in itself, but as a means to an end. Selected parts 
of the whole field will be studied as fully as needs 
warrant and as scientifically as now, but always 
in order that the application of the selected facts 
and principles may be given in a careful study of 
the larger geography of given areas and regions. 
This study will involve the use of texts, maps and 
atlases, will be strong in laboratory work, will in- 
clude the elements of political and commercial 
geography, and will be well knit into a united 
whole. Such a course, or one on closely similar 
lines, will have all the strength of the present 
work in physical geography, but will be more valu- 
able as a part of a secondary course than any 
specialized phase of the subject of geography can

be. Regional geography for secondary schools 
will not be a thing of ‘shreds and patches’; it 
will not be feebly related facts and semi-useful 
statistics, easy to learn and equally easy to forget. 
It will be a disciplinary subject of great worth in 
the education of any person of secondary age.’’ 
And is not this equally true of the regional treat- 
ments in the seventh and eighth grades? 
The argument for a regional treatment in the‘ 
higher grades, as seen by the author, are these: 
1. The units are larger and ‘‘scrappiness”’ is 
avoided. 
2. There is economy of time. Often the geo- 
graphical facts relating to a small political 
unit are equally true of a large physio- 
graphic region. 
3. The treatment is more scientific, the two 
great phases of geography, the physical 
‘ and ontological, being ideally correlated. 
4. Because of the above, the organization is 
close and strong, the organizing principles 
being the causal or rational idea or ele- 
ment.* 
The physiographic region is the natural and 
logical unit for study. or

    CHAPTER XIV. 
GENERALIZATION AND ORGANIZATION OF GEOGRAPH- 
icAL Mareriats. THe CausaL Huements. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Why organization is important; lack of organization in the old 
geography; the causal element emphasized in the new geog- 
raphy; the organizing principle of geography. 
The reaction against formalism in education; how the facts and 
items of geography function in generalizations; the value of 
generalizations. 
It is the conviction of the writer that there is 
no failure in teaching more serious than the fail- 
ure to generalize. The character of certain sub- 
jects, and the method of instruction, make them 
especially subject to ‘such omission. Geography 
is exceedingly liable to suffer from the teacher’s 
neglect to organize and generalize. The climax of 
all good teaching is reached in these processes, 
and any instruction that stops short of them fails 
accordingly. 
In a deductive study, like geometry, every con- 
clusion is a general truth, not only applicable to 
put necessary in any further development of the 
subject. Each conclusion is a premise in a suc- 
ceeding theorem; the subject tends to unify itself. 
Inductive studies place more responsibility upon 
166
-P-A-G-E-169
GENERALIZATION AND ORGANIZATION 167 
“the teacher. Becduse the content of geography 
is so broad and varied, and because its nature, 
phase, and values have been so poorly understood, 
it has doubtless suffered more from a lack of 
organization than any of the common school sub- 
jects. 
_ The old geography devoted itself almost wholly 
to fact study. Vast numbers of items were learned 
empirically, as ends in themselves. There was so 
little sequence, aim and reason in the subject that 
it fell far short of a science. It was composed of 
cross-sections of geology, astronomy, zodlogy, 
botany, ete., but the subject-matter was not articu- 
lated for a purpose. The old question of ‘‘what 
and where are the following’’ is suggestive. Iso- 
lated and unrelated facts, interesting in’ them- 
selves but often valueless, because they did not 
bear upon any generalization, engaged the atten- 
tion of the student. 
The New Geography involves a strong rational 
element. The study of any region necessitates the 
consideration of three sets of factors or processes. 
These may be designated as inorganic, dynamic 
and organic. The inorganic phase considers the 
earth’s envelopes in static conditions—as the 
crust, its topography, rocks, soils, minerals, the 
atmospheric and aqueous envelopes as related to 
rock-weathering and oxidation, and to plant and 
animal life. The dynamic deals with the inter- 
action of these envelopes as influenced by heat, 
gravity and planetary motion. This phase in- 
cludes the subject usually treated in dynamic geol-  
-P-A-G-E-170
  168 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
ogy. The organic deals with ‘life as fostered by” 
particular combinations of local influences. 
It may be said by some that these limits are too 
broad, but any adequate study of a man’s environ- 
ment leads to all of these investigations. If mere 
fact is the goal of geographical study, then the . 
‘““why,’’ the rational side of geography, may be 
lopped off, and we shall then return to the old 
basis of teaching the subject. If, however, an 
understanding of the earth as a habitat is the ob- 
ject of geographical study, then certainly much 
value must be placed upon reason and relation- 
ship. 
Without taking cognizance of the causal 
idea, it would be quite impossible to: organize 
the subject-matter of geography. Careful selec- 
tion and arrangement of data must precede induc- 
tion, inference, conclusion. The rational element 
is the thread upon which the facts are strung. 
The empirical facts of the old geography were 
lost as readily as beads from a broken/ string, but 
perhaps the loss was not great because facts 
learned after such manner are insignificant. Sig- 
nificance comes when order is established, when, - 
as Dr. Harris says, one fact is made to_explain an- 
other to which it is related. An arrangement of 
facts to show logical sequence is organization. It 
assists the memory, clarifies and intensifies the 
meaning, and leads toward a classification of geo- 
graphic material. 
Men succeed best in industrial life when they 
best adjust themselves to their environment. To

some degree man may modify an unfavorable 
condition; that being done, the best adjustment is 
effected when human effort is applied most har- 
moniously to the remaining natural conditions. 
Failure to succeed follows a failure to interpret 
natural conditions aright. The poor success of 
the early Puritans is an apt illustration of a poor 
adjustment to physiographic conditions. The in- 
fluence of geography on political and industrial 
history is now generally conceded. It is to this 
_ theme that Prof. Brigham and Miss Semple have 
so successfully lent themselves, and scores of ex- 
amples could be given to show how natural re- 
sources and environment have eventually deter- 
mined man’s residence and occupation. The study 
of adjustment is one of the most interesting and 
fruitful phases of geography, and emphasizes 
_ strongly the rational element. It is held by some 
that in seeking causes there is danger in going 
beyond the limits of geography proper and enter- 
ing the domain of pure science. If a bit of science - 
is here or there necessary to explain a condition, 
then let it strike sharply against the geographical 
fact of which it becomes a legitimate part, stand- 
ing in the relation of cause to effect. 
Modern educational methods react against 
formalism. The repetition of rules and formule 
is now subordinate and incidental to a comprehen- 
sion of ideas. The laboratory method in science 
has substituted for the ‘‘letter that killeth’”’ the 
“‘spirit which maketh alive.’? Hven the study of 
_ a language, with its multiplicity of forms, is suc-
-P-A-G-E-172
  170 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
cessfully approached from the thought side. Why 
should facts in geography be taught arbitrarily? 
The whole subject of physiography has to do with 
cause, and the responses of the organic world are 
results or effects of certain local sets of condi- 
tions. Thus, the causal, or the rational, is prom- 
inent throughout the subject of geography. Is 
not, then, this element the logical basis for organ- 
ization? The value of types is manifest here as 
in other departments of science. But a type is 
only a concrete illustration of a general principle 
which obtains, in slightly modified form, in a mul- 
titude of instances. Its value lies in the fact that 
the student, through cursory examination and 
hasty comparison of the new example, recognizes 
the principle and classifies his information. 
Unorganized geographical material has but lit- 
tle value and significance. The educational value 
of geography increases as the rational element 
is recognized. The work of the earlier geography 
is, indeed, to observe, to learn facts,-and to gather 
material; though to some extent, even in this 
phase, the causal idea may be recognized. When, 
however, considerable information along various 
lines has been gained, it seems to be the true func- 
tion of geography to induce from this information 
as data definite principles. The student may still 
continue to gather and learn facts, but the time 
has come when he should have a place to put these 
facts in orderly arrangement. This comparing 
and relating of data to strengthen and clarify 
meaning and to establish general principles which
-P-A-G-E-173
GENERALIZATION AND ORGANIZATION 1911 
shall serve as categories for the reception of new 
material constitute organization as applied to 
geography. A student who has mastered a few 
general principles may then proceed to some ex- 
tent in a deductive way. Knowing a few general 
truths relating to a region, he should be able to 
deduce with considerable accuracy the details of 
life conditions that prevail, and, looking back- 
ward, he should be able to read in outline its geo- 
logical history. Is it not obvious, then, thaf the 
rational element, viz., reason and relationship, 
should be the major organizing principle of geog- 
raphy and that with the recognition of this prin- 
ciple will increase the educational value of the 
subject?

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
What. constitutes a wise use of text books; a bad use; the char- 
acter of text books; the importance of good assignments, 
danger of committing meaningless statements; effect on 
pupils. 
Illustrative assignments; the value of problems; how to secure 
initiative on the part of pupils; objections offered by teachers. 
Text book method or special plans, which? Plans necessary for 
results; subject-matter and method not to be condemned 
simply because found in text books; the text book a back- 
ground of geography teaching. 
It has been pointed out in another chapter that 
the introduction of problems in the teaching of 
geography would do much to bring about a wiser 
use of the text book. Perhaps the greatest im- 
rovement in geographical teaching would follow 
of necessity the reforms of vicious text-book 
habits. What constitutes a wise and reasonable 
use of the text? 
First let the question be answered negatively: 
A very bad though very common practice, it is 
feared, is the assignment of a definite portion of 
the text-book material, without any definite idea 
in mind as to what there is in that portion of the 
text that is valuable, reliable and pertinent for 
172 : 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
THE USE OF TEXT BOOKS 173 
the particular class in hand. This statement no 
doubt seems to be an innocent platitude; but it is 
so important that it would bear underscoring sev- 
eral times. Let us analyze the case. 
To begin with, teachers must appreciate the 
fact that text books are compendiums of very brief 
statements and condensed treatments. This is no 
criticism of the texts, however. The great won- 
der is that so vast a subject as the earth and its 
life can be so interestingly treated in such meagre 
volumes. Poor teachers usually find fault with 
the text books. Do not forget that every text pre- 
supposes a teacher. Probably no author of geog- 
raphies was ever satisfied with his books. The 
very nature of the case has compelled a ‘‘hop, 
skip and jump” treatment. The Earth and Its 
Inhabitants, by Elisee Reclus, requires eighteen 
encyclopedic volumes, and even this excellent 
work gives no extended account of very many of 
the topics treated. The author of the school text 
confronts the difficult task of making his subject 
interesting without being permitted to develop 
his topies to any reasonable degree. 
The first failure in the use of the text is de- 
tected in unpurposeful assignments. Pupils are 
directed to study ‘‘so much,’’ but no hint is given 
‘as to why they should study the lesson. Their at- 
tention is not centered on any particular facts that 
should be considéred, and the reading of the les- 
son sometimes is quite akin to reading the dic- 
tionary—‘‘the subject changes too often.’? No 
adequate interest is aroused.
-P-A-G-E-176
  174 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
The second failure grows out of the one just 
stated. Without purpose there is no discrimina- 
tion of the laconic statements. Each statement is 
equally important to the pupil. There is no cen- 
tral theme, hence no focalization of consciousness 
on any text statement. What concentration can 
follow such procedure? 
Again, such irrational study results in commit- 
ting meaningless statements. They have no mean- 
ing because they are unrelated in the pupil’s 
mind. And it has already been pointed out and 
emphasized that the element of relationship, the 
causal element, constitutes the basis for: organiz- 
ing, or tying together geographical materials. 
Therefore such an unpedagogical method cannot 
lead to the organization of subject matter. 
All of this being true, what of the interest in 
the study? Will the lessons not ‘‘simmer down’’ 
very soon into a monotonous, lifeless grind? As 
already shown, such method, or lack of method, 
tends to passivity on the part of the pupils. They 
are recipients merely of text statements. There 
are no demands for real thinking or for initiative 
in study. Hence it may be stated, positively, that 
a wise use of the text must secure quite the oppo- 
site results of those mentioned, viz. : 
(a). The assignment must be characterized by 
definite purpose. 
(b) Definiteness of purpose leads pupils to dis- 
criminate, to evaluate statements and to 
choose the pertinent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE USE OF TEXT BOOKS LB 
(ce) A definite aim or purpose serves as a nu- 
cleus or center about which related ideas 
are to be grouped. This relating of ideas 
is fundamental to organization. 
(d) Definite aims or ae secure variety 
in daily lessons. 
(e) The adaptation of the tock to the purpose 
of the pupil awakens genuine thought-ac- 
tivity and stimulates some degree of initi- 
ative. 
So far as the mass of teachers is concerned, 
there is no inclination on the part of the author to 
make it appear that a vast amount of planning 
and skirmishing is necessary to secure at least 
fairly good results. In the following illustration 
the practical rather than the ideal will be sug- 
gested. Let us suppose that the North Central 
States are to be studied, and that the text treats 
the states separately, by political rather than by 
regional units. Instead of saying, ‘‘You may 
study Illinois, Iowa and Missouri for tomorrow,’ 
the teacher assigns as follows: 
1. Pupils, the Corn Belt extends from Ohio 
through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri into 
Kansas and Nebraska. For your lesson, select all 
of the statements from your book that seem to 
tell why corn thrives well in these states. Write 
a paragraph in your own neneee that will tell 
these facts. 
2. Select all of the statements that tell of the 
production of corn in these states. In your own
-P-A-G-E-178
  176 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
language write a paragraph that will tell these 
facts. 
3. Make a sketch map of these states and 
write across it, ‘‘The Corn Belt States.’’ 
This is no ideal assignment. It is one, however, 
that the rural teacher, who has a long program, 
will find practicable. However much this assign- 
ment may be open to criticism, it is purposeful, 
and it necessitates the discrimination of text-book 
statements. It must be an improvement on the 
assignment that calls only for an aimless reading 
of the same text-matter. In making the suggestion 
the writer has in mind a sixth grade class, using 
the advanced geography of a two-book series. 
Please understand the position here taken. The 
assignment has to do with the pupil’s use of the 
text book. It is not thought that the assignment 
will in any sense do justice to the topic ‘‘Corn and 
the Corn Belt.’’ The second lesson might be of 
this character: ; 
1. Ascertain from \your text the boundaries of 
the Corn Belt. On your sketch of yesterday draw 
a dotted line around the region and color it light 
yellow with water color. 
2. Study your text to learn if there are corn 
markets in these states. If so, indicate the loca- 
tion of these markets or cities on your map. 
3. Review your text to learn of the uses made 
of corn. In your own language write a paragraph 
which tells these text-book facts. 
4. Review your text to learn if corn is shipped
-P-A-G-E-179
t ’ 
THE USE OF TEXT BOOKS 177 
out of the Corn Belt. Write a paragraph that 
tells the facts gathered. 
5. Make a sketch map to show the commercial 
route of corn from some city mentioned as a mar- 
ket in the Corn Belt, to some distant city market. 
These problems or exercises will about exhaust 
the contribution of the text book on this subject, 
though ‘‘distribution maps,’’ if found in the text, 
and excellent pictures, may form the basis of fur- 
ther exercises in comparisons and inferences. 
It should be understood that the above sug- 
_ gestive method of using the text leads in no sense 
to a systematic treatment of the topic; the 
‘‘rounding out’? falls to the teacher, and through 
development and supplementary exercises much 
can be done of real interest and value. Here are 
a few suggestive problems: 
(a) What temperature, moisture and soil con- 
ditions are most favorable to the produc- 
tion of corn? 
(b) Of what importance is corn as a commer- 
cial commodity? Where shipped? Why? 
(c) What are the uses of corn? What products 
are made from corn?* Where? 
(d) How does the corn industry help the 
farmer? The transporter? The manufac- 
turer? The consumer? 
How does the production of corn affect the 
stock industry? The coal industry? The 
starch and sugar industries? The manu- =. (e 
* Here the value of the museum is apparent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
ee 
178 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
facture of implements? The growth of 
cities? 
(f) How does corn compare with other cereals 
asa food? What countries make large use 
of corn products? Why? 
(g) Compare the United States with other 
countries in corn production. 
The development of topics of this kind is quite 
dependent upon the teacher. But the significance 
and general richness of the study is contingent 
upon the development of topics beyond the point 
of exposition in the ordinary text. The use of 
geographical readers in this connection is of much 
value. In making even a brief study of corn, chil- 
dren will be delighted to read the section on corn 
in Carpenter’s Industrial Reader, Foods, or to 
read some chapter from The Book of Corn. 
Learning by rote has little place in geography, 
and probably the chief error is that of committing 
condensed statements which, without elaboration 
and assimilation, cannot possibly be of much 
value either as knowledge or as educative mate- 
rial. Prof. C. H. Leete, who has prepared a small 
volume of Exercises in Geography, says: Through 
proper exercises ‘‘pupils are led to collate facts 
for themselves and to write their own descrip- 
tions. They learn as they work; their interest 
arises from the processes of acquisition and ex- 
pression; the result is the power of perceiving es- 
sential facts and of recording what is seen.’? To
-P-A-G-E-181
THE USE OF TEXT BOOKS 179 
this the writer would add that the interest will 
grow out of the self-activity of the pupils. 
In the above discussion it has been assumed 
that the text is about all the teacher has to use. 
This attitude is assumed and suggestions made 
accordingly, to the end that no teacher can say, 
as he might if an elaborate plan were suggested, 
““T haven’t the books and maps and time to teach 
that way.’’ But every teacher can refrain from 
the senseless rote work and can substitute simple 
problems for the meaningless empirical teaching. 
If, however, the teacher in graded schools has 
more facilities and reasonable time, more elab- 
orate plans can be executed with profit. In this 
event more exercises based on atlases and maps 
should be introduced, and the text used largely 
to verify inductions and inferences. An illustra- 
tion of the'use of the text in this case is given in 
another chapter under the caption, ‘‘An Illus- 
trative Exercise Based upon Longman’s New 
School Atlas.’’ 
In a recent article* Prof. Salisbury contends 
that better results would accrue from a closer fol- 
lowing of text books, as few teachers are compe- 
tent to make better plans than are found in the 
books, and further that the teacher’s energy is 
often spent in making plans rather than in realiz- 
ing them. ‘This may be true; but we must not fail 
to recognize that a text book is a sort of balance 
struck between the requirements of widely differ- 
ing regions and interests; that classes of pupils

-P-A-G-E-182
  180 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
vary greatly, even within the limits é6f a medium- 
sized city, and that teaching facilities and general 
conditions often make this ‘‘struck balance’? plan 
inadequate and uninteresting. 
The idea often held that pupils must never look 
into their books while in class is old-fashioned and 
traditional. Quite often the recitation period may 
very profitably be spent with books open and 
pupils intent on answering questions from maps, 
interpreting pictures, verifying inferences, or 
getting correct meaning from difficult sentences. 
Every teacher who secures good results must find 
such ‘‘study-recitations’’ necessary. Too often 
pupils are put to tasks without preparation; 
waste of time, mental confusion and discourage- 
ment are quite sure to follow. 
The author is in no sense condemning the use of 
text books. He is, however, making a strong plea 
for a wiser use of them. But a wiser use cannot 
be accomplished without a consideration of (a) 
the needs of pupils together with their already 
acquired knowledge; (b) the subject-matter as 
presented in the text book, and whether it is per- 
tinent, capable of satisfying the pupils’ needs and 
within their grasp; and (c) the best method of 
bringing the pupil and the subject-matter into 
the most harmonious relations. And what-is this 
best plan? Anything short of this at once reduces 
geography teaching to the old formal and em- 
pirical method. The successful teacher must plan; 
but it does not follow that because the text book 
has selected and arranged certain subject-matter
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE USE OF, TEXT BOOKS 181 
that such material must of course be condemned, 
_ and new matter selected and arranged to show the 
‘‘finger marks’’ of the teacher. And yet good 
schools can be pointed out in which a sentiment 
has been .created that anything found in text 
books of geography, at least the adopted texts, is 
of little consequence, either from the standpoint 
of subject-matter or method. 
Text books are wisely handled when— 
(a) assignments from them take me form of 
problems, 
(b) the solution. of problems bawaichind a mo- 
tive to consider and discriminate between 
text-book statements, 
(c) subject-matter satisfies the pupils’ needs, 
(d) only generalizations satisfy the demands of 
the problem, 
(e) independent work is necessitated by the 
problem, and 
(f) much use is made of maps and graphs. 
The teacher should recognize the text book as 
the background of the work. Where other courses 
of study are not provided, it serves ds an elabo- 
rated course of study. But it is not to be swal- 
lowed whole. For many reasons the order of les- 
sons may need to be changed. Some lessons may 
profitably be studied pretty thoroughly; some 
only carefully read; and some may need to be 
omitted. That text books are abused does not 
condemn them; it rather reflects upon the intelli- 
gence of the teacher.

CHAPTER XVI. 
Tx» Vatve or Magazines anD GovERNMENT Pus- 
LICATIONS IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The value of magazine articles in teaching geography; text books 
necessarily brief; magazines are unconventional; they appeal 
strongly. 
Subject-matter of standard periodicals and government reports 
reliable. 
Magazines well illustrated; place emphasis on social side of sub- 
ject; illustration of the richness of current publications in 
geographical information. 
Sources from which helpful material can be secured. 
Educative material of high grade often appears 
in magazines, and since magazines are now so 
widely circulated there seems to be no serious ob- 
stacle in the way of bringing them into the school. 
As to government publications, it is their func- 
tion to educate, and as goodly. nw he 
government issues are free, there certainly is no 
valid reason why they should not be drawn upon, 
together with the popular and technical maga- 
zines, to serve often as helps and sometimes as 
bases of school-room lessons. 
183
-P-A-G-E-186
  184 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
The materials drawn from these sources are of 
distinct value in teaching geography because: 
1. They serve as valuable supplements to brief 
school texts. 
2. The subject-matter is authentic and up-to- 
date; it gives a living touch to the instruc. 
tion. fe 
3. The articles are usually well illustrated. 
4. They afford the best media for emphasiz- 
ing the social phase of the subject. 
1. Text books are laconic in their styles. This 
is necessarily the case, since they deal mainly with 
the principles of the subject. They are mere out- 
lines at the best. Hence the imperative need of 
supplementary material. This we have in gen- 
erous quantity, in the form of geographical read- 
ers, but many schools are not provided with such 
reference books. The magazine article is usually 
of much greater length than articles in geograph- 
ical readers, a fact that offers an advantage in 
type study exercises where the elaboration should 
be rather comprehensive. Still another advantage 
lies in the fact that the magazine article is not 
the conventional source from which to supplement 
the lesson. Like the occasional school visitor, it 
eauses the pupils ‘‘to sit up and take notice.’’ The 
few supplementary and reference books that the 
average school has (if it has any) are often worn, 
torn, dilapidated and emit the ancient odor of 
dusty school rooms. How welcome the fresh, 
clean, beautifully illustrated magazine! Unlike 
the school book, it was not invented especially for
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE VALUE OF MAGAZINES 185° 
‘the school room, but is cosmopolitan and related 
‘to other worlds than ours.’’ 
2. The subject-matter of standard magazines 
is far more reliable on most topics than is the text. 
Boundaries, populations and trade relations are 
always changing. Maps and texts, as a result, are 
ever in danger of becoming obsolete. The use of 
current literature assists in making needed cor- 
rections. Their use also saves the energy and 
time which might otherwise be devoted to some 
topic now untrue by bringing the information of 
wholly new conditions. The intelligent and re- 
fined depend upon current literature to keep in- 
formed. The magazine performs the definite 
function of supplying the recent and reliable 
world-information, and for this reason it seems 
wise to welcome it into the school room. 
3. Reference has already been made to the 
pictorial side of the magazine. This feature is of 
no little moment, and nearly all of the argument 
advanced for the use of pictures in school applies 
with equal validity to the illustrations of our best 
magazines. An instance in which the illustrative 
value of a magazine is unusually great is found 
in the ‘‘National Geographic Magazine.’’* This 
publication is so well illustrated that it seems to 
deserve a place on the school reading table if for 
no other reason than that of its pictures. Many 
other cases of equal merit might be mentioned. 
4. The magazine article emphasizes the social 
ee Geographic Society, Hubbard Memorial Hall, Washing- 
ton, D. C. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  186 TEE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
side of geography. Information gleaned from its 
source makes more impression. The school suffers 
from isolation. The magazine brings into the 
school a little of the big, teeming world. Its para- 
graphs have no set-to-school-order arrangement, 
and the content no suggestions that it was pro- 
duced for the school alone. The magazine is a 
cosmopolitan book, not a school book, and in this 
lies its particular power. Through such media the 
school materials can best be socialized. The more 
our schools can draw upon the actual world for 
its educative materials, the more will be the prog- 
ress toward uniting school and life interests. 
Can there be any doubt as to the wisdom of 
using magazine articles in the teaching of geog- 
raphy? The practical question of securing the 
magazines still confronts the teacher. Perhaps 
the children can be interested sufficiently to con- 
tribute a few cents each in order to secure the 
“National Geographic Magazine,’’ the ‘‘ World’s 
Work,’’ or the ‘‘World Today,’’ for their school 
room. But this question of expediency is one not 
to be argued here. 
Should the teacher happen himself to be a sub- 
seriber to the ‘‘Journal of Geography,’’* he will 
find many articles quite readable by the upper 
grade pupils. Then, too, the monthly summary 
of ‘‘Current Articles on Commerce and Industry’’ 
which this excellent magazine gives will be of 
help to the teacher in locating useful geographic

So far the discussion has referred to magazines 
only. Since education and enlightenment is the 
function of government publications, and since 
they are largely for free distribution, little argu- 
ment is necessary to commend them to school use. 
These publications are highly authentic, a quality 
of much importance. Careful selection.and adap- 
tation are of course necessary. Some of the cir- 
culars, bulletins and monographs are too techni- 
cal for public school use; others are readable even 
by the pupils of higher grades. As in the case of
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE VALUE OF MAGAZINES 189 
magazines, they are usually illustrated and deal 
with great diversity of subjects. 
For use in geography, the publications of the 
United States Geological Survey; of the Depart- 
ment of Commerce and Labor; of the Treasury 
Department, and the Department of Agriculture, 
are most useful. In addition to the publications 
of the general government, there are many valu- 
able state publications, notably those of the state 
geological surveys, the experiment stations, and 
agricultural colleges. 
The United States Geological Survey has a long 
list of publications. Teachers should address the 
Director U. S. Geological Survey, Washington, D. 
C., for the ‘‘List of Publications of the U. S. 
Geological Survey.’’ . Reports and bulletins, some 
free and others at nominal cost, are available. 
The various state geological surveys issue an- 
nual reports, many of which are very useful to 
teachers. The following recent publications of 
the Illinois State Geological Survey will serve as 
an illustration: 
Bulletin No. 3—‘‘Composition and Uses of 
Coal,’’ by S. W. Parr. 
Bulletin No. 4—‘‘Report of the Co-Operative 
Topographic Survey,’’ by H. M. Wilson. 
Educational Bulletins Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 
No. 1 treats of the region along Lake Michigan. 
No. 2 treats of the valley of the Des Plaines

pin to Pekin. :

No. 4 treats of the region about Hast St. Louis. 
A Monthly Summary of Commerce and Labor 
is published by the Bureau of Statistics, Treasury 
Department, and often contains monographs ‘of 
value in commercial geography, especially: e. g. - 
i 
Grain Trade in the United States.

The Consular Reports may be mentioned in 
this connection. They are free daily or monthly, 
and a trial will convince teachers of their practical 
use in the geography lesson. Address Bureau of 
Foreign Commerce, Washington, D. C.

Agriculture and the Statistical Atlas are of spe- 
cial value. Address, Bureau of Census, Washing-

The publications of the Department of Agricul- 
ture are numerous, useful and pertinent at this 
time, when agriculture is of so much interest.

  THE VALUE OF PICTURES 191 
Duplicate copies of selected papers might well be 
studied in class and then given to the pupils for 
home use. 
The ‘‘Year Book’’ of this department is of 
special value. Topics of the following nature are 
treated : : 
“‘Rice Culture in the United States.’’ 
“Life Zones and Crop Zones of the ‘United 
States.’’ 
“The Fruit Industry.’’ 
“Agricultural Resources of Hawaii.’ 
“Milk Supply of Boston and Other Cities.’’ 
‘Forest Conditions of Wisconsin,’’ etc., ete. 
The reports of Experiment Stations, and the 
Annual Reports of Farmers’ Institutes, are of 
interest to teachers, who should apply to the di- 
rectors. of these institutions for information. The 
. State Railway and Warehouse Commissions often 
distribute useful maps of their respective states. 
SUGGESTIONS AND QUESTIONS. 
1. Why should geographical text books especially need supple- 
menting? 
2. Why should current magazine articles appeal strongly to pupils? 
3. What advantage has the unconventional source of information 
over the conventional? 
. What features of text books are most likely to become obsolete? 
. What phase of geography is emphasized in current magazines?

THE VALUE oF PicrurEs IN Tracuine GrocraPHy. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Why pictures are valuable in teaching geography; excellent 
medium to convey ideas; pictures quickly and easily read. 
Pictures give unity of impression; printed statements more likely 
to confuse. 
Pictures are accurate and attractive. 
Suggestions as to use of pictures; text book pictures not to be 
neglected; how to read a picture; illustrations. 
Collections of pictures; how to use stereographs; value of stere- 
opticon. 
Good pictures constitute one of the most valu- 
able helps in teaching geography. Fortunately in 
these later years the popularity of the camera has 
wrought wonders in making good pictures cheap. 
The public’s taste has improved. More and better 
pictures are demanded. Many of our magazines 
have come to be veritable picture books. The aa- 
vertiser resorts more and more to the efficacy of 
pictures to herald his wares. And is it not psy- 
chologically sound to do so? Let us examine the 
case. 
‘1. A picture is particularly valuable, first of 
all, because it is a highly economical medium 
through which ideas can be conveyed. It econ- 
omizes both time and effort. Through the picture 
192  
-P-A-G-E-195
  ‘THE VALUE OF PICTURES 193 
the complete situation is projected. There is no 
time spent in building up, constructively, the idea 
from words, phrases and sentences. The picture 
is a literal reproduction, that brings into focal 
consciousness the required idea as quickly and 
easily as the original would if exposed to view. 
Indeed, the picture may sometimes even surpass 
the original, from the fact that the artist may 
have selected wisely, omitting from the field many 
details which would obscure the central theme. 
In nature, the observer is often compelled to 
pause, to select, and to cast out, before he can see 
exactly what he wants to see. At first he ‘‘cannot 
see the town for the houses.’’ That pictures are 
often better than the originals is attested by the 
fact that few persons are satisfied with pictures 
that are exact ‘‘likénesses.’’ So far as the efficacy 
of pictures is concerned in teaching geography, a 
wise selection of a central theme or, to put it 
negatively, the elimination of irrelevant details, is 
of much importance. The camera picks out for 
the observer, and saves him the trouble. 
In getting ideas from the printed page the 
superiority of the picture is beyond question. 
Words not only bring the idea by degrees and 
slowly, but in comparison with pictures they 
necessitate more mental effort. Word symbols 
must be translated into concrete images, and the 
gap between word symbols and the desired image 
_israther great. The building of a picture through 
reading is a synthetic process, which in itself sug- 
gests labor and time. In reading pictures the
-P-A-G-E-196
  194 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
process is reversed; the picture, if a good one, 
presents a unity at first sight, and in a further 
study of the picture we analyze, and eliminate 
details, if necessary. 
2. The second value of the picture has, then, 
been pointed out, viz., unity of impression. If 
descriptive composition be somewhat complex in 
order to be exact, it often happens that the mental 
pictures do not differentiate themselves clearly. 
This can be tested as follows: Ask a class of 
seventh or eighth grade pupils to read a page of 
description and select the important pictures. It 
is likely that there will be considerable variation 
as to the number of pictures formed by different 
pupils, and this is probably due to the fact that 
the printed symbols, in yielding to this transla- 
tion, failed to call, in all cases, the same ideas into 
focal consciousness. : 
8. Pictures are accurate: But little need be 
said on this point, except again by way of com- 
parison with the printed page. A strange word 
may be a stumbling block in constructive concep- 
tion, whereas in the picture we see the unity in 
familiar words of our own vocabulary. However, 
it is no doubt true that in reading a picture, that 
is, in reducing it to language, visual perceptions 
are made clearer and more significant through a 
correlation with language. 
4. Pictures are attractive, even beautiful, in 
our best text books. Recall the ilnstrations in 
Harold W. Fairbanks’ Home Geography. The 
well-selected and clearly printed pictures make
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE VALUE OF PICTURES ve 196 
this little volume truly artistic. Indeed, it is 
through the attractiveness of pictures very largely 
that beginners are taught the printed symbols. 
It would seem that there is little need of arguing 
the use of pictures in teaching. 
5. The first suggestion offered is that you 
make good use of the pictures in the text book. 
Do not trust the pupils to read the pictures for 
themselves. True, they will get much from them 
without the teacher’s help, and they will enjoy 
them; but they cannot be expected to get the best 
lessons without guidance. At any rate, it is the 
teacher’s business to know, and the knowledge is 
secured by testing the pupils on picture reading 
as you would test them on context reading. 
The writer has before him a picture of a whale- 
back steamer passing through the ‘‘Soo’’ locks. 
As a class exercise the pupils may be directed to 
open their books at this picture. They are given 
a littlé time for silent reading. Hach pupil is then 
required to read something from the picture. If 
the points are not all brought out, questions from 
‘the teacher will lead the class to see the additional 
significance in the illustration. 
1. Why is the ship called a ‘‘whaleback’’? 
What sort of cargo is it built to carry? 
Show why. What are its advantages? 
2. Examine the lock. Why is it necessary ? 
Which of the lakes has a higher water level? 
Can you determine from the picture some- 
thing of the manner of operating the lock?

3. With what kind of cargo is the whaleback 
loaded? Where is it probable that it loaded? 
What sort of country, then, is accessible to 
Duluth? What of the soils? The topog- 
raphy? The rainfall? If this region ex- 
ports wheat, what do you think it imports? 
Why?

where discussed as sources of information, is 
taken from a valuable paper by Marian Weller.* 
“‘The picture lesson should be one to secure the 
activity of the child, and not one merely to hold 
his attention. This point may be illustrated by 
a couple of lessons with a class which was study- 
ing the Philippine Islands. 
“Some extra copies of two or three of the illus- 
trated volumes of the Report-of the Philippine 
Commission were gotten by the teacher, and the 
pictures and printed matter bearing upon certain 
selected topics were cut out and arranged for the 
use of individual pupils in the class. Such topics 
as the cultivation of rice, the hemp industry, the 
water buffalo, native methods of transportation, 
the construction of a native house, were found 
well illustrated, and each topic was assigned to 
some pupil to be presented before the class. In 
connection with some of the topics museum ma- 
terial was brought in to supplement the pictures, 
such as a bundle of hemp fiber prepared by the 
natives, and a protective covering made from dry 
palm leaves, illustrating the manner in which the 
roofs of the houses are thatched to shed the rain. 
“The way in which the ‘rice’ topic was pre- 
sented will serve as illustration. The topic was 
assigned a day or two before it was to be reported 
on, and the pupil prepared his exercise from the 
printed references and pictures which had been 
*“Nature Study and Geography.” Pamphlet of the Northern Ili- 
nois Teachers’ Association.  
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  198 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
collected. In the presentation of the topic it was 
explained ‘with the pictures, using a picture with 
each step, how the ground was prepared with the 
_ help of the native plow and harrow and the water 
buffalo; how the fields were surrounded with 
levees and flooded; how the rice was planted by 
hand and later harvested with a small hand sickle, 
and then threshed, by being trampled on, either 
by the natives themselves or by the water buffalo. 
Then with pictures it was explained what is being 
‘done on a government farm with more modern 
methods. Each picture was shown to the class, 
and in it a definite thing was called attention to, 
which was to be seen by the class. After the dis- 
eussion of the topic some stalks of rice in the 
head, threshed rice, rice with hull removed, rice 
polished, and rice flour and bran were shown.’’ 
Collect pictures to supplement the text book. 
Many fine booklets profusely illustrated are dis- 
tributed by transportation companies. Often 
whole page photographic reprints .are given. 
Watch the announcements of these companies in 
daily papers. Send for free booklets. The larger 
views can be mounted on cardboard for conveni- 
ence in class use. Label each picture and put in 
its proper class. An active teacher can soon col- 
lect several hundred pictures on geography, his- 
tory and art; such a collection, properly used, is 
of great value.* Railroad companies often give 
away fine views—sometimes mounted or framed—

in sets, illustrating travel, commerce and industrial arts. See Bib- 
ography.

which are not only useful for geographical illus- 
tration but ornamental as well. 
As above suggested, the value of pictures de- 
pends much on their classification and arrange- 
ment for immediate use. If no better system is 
possible, large manila envelopes may be used to 
good advantage. An index of the enclosed pic- 
tures should be written on the face of the en- 
velope. 
STEREOGRAPHS. - 
The stereoscopic views (stereographs) are very 
convenient for use in geography. Certain com- 
panies are making specialties of educational 
views. The photographs are taken by experts, 
and by use of the stereoscope are made to stand 
out in bold relief. These views are excelled only 
by the stereopticon views, which, of course, are 
beyond the reach of most schools. 
The stereographs are selected and arranged in 
sets, each treating of some particular subject. 
These sets can be used to excellent advantage in 
_ type studies. Almost every subject is treated. 
Some important industries are illustrated in all 
of their phases by as many as twenty-five to fifty 
views. Taken in order, they represent every 
phase of great industries. j 
Some companies have employed educational ex- 
perts to write descriptions to accompany the 
views. Usually the descriptions are on the backs 
of the pictures, and make the views doubly valu- 
able. They can be used in two ways: 3  
-P-A-G-E-202
    200 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
1. The views and stereoscope may be placed 
upon a table and each pupil in the class required 
to go in turn, look at the views, and read the de- 
scriptions, as a preparation for the recitation. 
2. The stereoscope with an appropriate view 
may be started through the class during a recita- 
tion, it being understood that each pupil shall have 
a half minute to look at the view. The recitation, 
in this case, does not stop. When all selected 
views have gone around, each pupil may be 
handed a particular view and given a minute or 
two to prepare the gist of the description, which. 
he then recites to his classmates. 
Everything considered, the stereographic pic- 
tures are the most practical, since they are com- 
paratively inexpensive and always ready for in- 
stant use. 
The stereopticon is of great value as an educa- 
tional help. In the past it has been too expensive 
for many schools. Now, however, good lanterns 
are much cheaper and better. The electric lantern 
is the most practical where a current is available. 
Gasoline lanterns that work well may be purchased 
for a comparatively small amount, and village 
schools can easily afford one. Slides are some- 
what expensive, but this difficulty may largely be 
overcome by renting them. For full information 
concerning lanterns, lantern slides, stereographs 
and stereographic views, apply to any of the com- 
panies whose addresses are given in the bibliog- 
raphy, Chapter XXII.

I, SCHOOL MUSEUM. 
The text books on reading, language and geog- 
raphy constantly refer to objects and phenomena 
that, as yet, are outside the children’s experiences. 
A large part of the process of education consists 
in familiarizing the child with new things. In 
order that pupils shall know things and not 
merely names of things, other means than text 
books must be employed. The teacher can bring 
the pupils face to face with the new material or 
phenomena. 
1. By means of the School Museum. 
2. Through the School Excursion.

of significant things, is meant. Geography espe- 
cially refers to many articles of commerce which 
in their raw condition many people have never 
seen, and the ideas of which are vague and in- 
correct. 
There will be needed for the exhibit: 
1. A case or cabinet. This will furnish work 
for manual training. The pupils will bring 
needed tools and lumber. 
2. Bottles in which to preserve grains, seeds, 
berries, sands, soils, ete. The pupils will bring 
many bottles from home. These can be classified, 
and answer the purpose. Wide mouthed bottles 
are best. 
8. Labels. These can be bought, or white 
paper slips will answer, if a bottle of library paste 
is in the room. 
4. Boxes. Small pasteboard, wood and cigar 
boxes will serve as specimen trays for rocks, min- 
erals, etc. Boxes, bottles, etc., can be picked up 
as needed. , 
All materials should be neatly labeled, as: 
1. Macaroni Wheat, 
Commissioner of Immigration, 
Winnipeg, Canada. 
2. Fossil Fern. 
Collected by Edward Roberts, 
Cape Girardeau, Missouri. 
Illustrative materials to be useful must be con- 
veniently arranged, so that no time need be lost 
in presenting them to the class. A piece of granite

from some monument works; a specimen of iron 
pyrites—‘‘fool’s gold’’; a piece of obsidian from 
the Rockies, or'a sample of red hematite from the 
Superior region, passed about the class at just the 
proper moment, will add reality to the teaching. 
There are numerous manufacturing companies 
that furnish gratis, or at small cost, fine exhibits, 
showing processes through which raw materials 
pass in becoming finished products. Some of 
these are not only very attractive but possess 
much educative value. Not infrequently companies 
have published pamphlets descriptive of their 
manufacturing processes, and these, of course, are 
correct, and are the very best sources of informa- 
tion: Through the alertness and activity of wide- 
awake teachers, some schools have fine museums 
of illustrative materials. Almost every day a 
teacher can draw on the museum for an article to 
' illustrate some point in reading, language, liter- 
ature, history or geography. In just so far as 
such materials can be used to illustrate new ideas 
will school work be redeemed from the formal and 
meaningless grind. ’

strange materials, and to discriminate and select 
for a purpose. Through a movement of this kind 
pupils are frequently awakened, and the formal 
hum-drum of school may for a time give way to 
genuine interest. But, after all, a movement of 
this kind is secondary to the real work of the 
school. It should not be spasmodic; any interest 
enlisted should be made permanent and applied 
to the substantial work of the school. Recently, 
in a certain school known to the writer, the collec- 
tion of woods led to the learning of every tree 
that grew in the district, an accomplishment of 
no little moment. This spirit might extend to 
other:fields of observation. 
The teacher who undertakes the building of a 
museum will find considerable assistance in 
““Commercial Raw Materials’? * an inexpensive 
volume ‘‘descriptive of the origin, processes of 
preparation and uses of the most important com- 
mercial materials.’’ 
In discussing geographical museums Willis E. 
Johnson writes as follows: 
“The cabinet may not only contain materials 
of every conceivable kind illustrating products 
and industries, but may contain pictures and. 
slides illustrating people and natural and artificial 
scenery. The central museum should be equipped 
_with apparatus, an auditorium for optical projec- 
tion, and in proper grades the magnifying glass 
and microscope should find a place. The loan and 
exchange idea should pervade every cabinet col- 
* See Bibliography.
-P-A-G-E-210
  208 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
lection, and every child and home should be glad 
to assist and contribute. Exchanges may be made 
not only among schools of the same city, but ex- 
changes and loans may extend to différent cities 
and may be national or even international in 
eharacter.’’ 
Certain companies furnish geographical mu- 
seums or cabinets ready for use. They are valu- 
able helps in teaching commercial geography. 
However, the writer feels that the adoption of the 
“‘ready made’’ cabinet sacrifices the opportunity 
to stimulate interest and to teach lessons in geog- 
raphy by building a museum through the activi- 
ties of the school itself. A poorer collection thus 
made stands for more educationally than a better 
one secured by direct purchase. On two occasions 
the writer has had members of his classes do the 
planning, conduct the correspondence, and make 
personal visits and excursions to secure mate- 
vials; and, having secured contributions, the 
pupils wrote descriptions of the objects, products, 
industries, ete., with such care that they became 
reliable sources of information. Such initiative, 
guided by definite motives, is indicative of an 
interest that brings results. 
II. INDUSTRIAL EXCURSIONS. 
Through the school excursion, teachers should 
take advantage of every opportunity to study the 
physical phenomena and industrial activities in 
the vicinity of the schools. Unless actual obser- 
vations be made and concrete materials used,
-P-A-G-E-211
VALUE OF ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS — 209 
geography and nature study soon deteriorate into 
armere study of words, barren of all clear ideas. 
The object of the excursion is bringing together at 
short range the pupil and the materials to be 
studied. The world of industry is the only genu- 
ine laboratory. 
The industrial excursion emphasizes the human 
or social phase of geography. Much of economics 
and sociology can be brought out through the 
study of industries. Even intermediate ‘pupils 
will comprehend many of the simple social rela- 
tionships made apparent through the study of 
home geography. Through this phase of geog- 
raphy some contribution to moral training may 
be made. 
In general, the study of industries emphasizes 
the needs of individual men, and industrial plants 
are social’ organizations whose function it is to 
satisfy these needs. 
Modern nations practice a commercial economy, 
and sharp contrasts can be made between this 
economy and the simple self-sufficient economy of 
primitive peoples, and of our New England grand- 
parents. Manufacture and commerce depend upon 
““commercial’’ economy. Hence the consideration 
of commercial needs leads to the study of indus- 
tries and plants as follows:

ways have clearly in mind exactly what he wishes 
the pupils to observe. Pupils may pass by inter- 
esting and educative phenomena daily, but with- 
out the guidance of the teacher may fail to see the
-P-A-G-E-213

essential features. So a well-formulated plan of 
‘procedure is essential to good results. Illustra- 
tion of this is seen in the precise and systematic 
way that the guides of certain large concerns show 
visitors through their plants. 
Not a little of the value of an excursion depends 
upon the reviews, explanations and discussions 
which should always follow in the class room. 
Here imperfect observations may be supple- 
mented and misunderstood processes explained. 
The reduction to writing should be the final 
step in this work, the summaries being valuable in 
unifying and associating such materials as pos- 
sess true educative value. 
Ill. PHYSIOGRAPHIC FIELD WORK. 
Much has been said about field work in geog- 
raphy, but as yet little is done in the public 
schools. Excuses are made by grade teachers on 
the ground that.there is not sufficient time, that 
it cuts into other work, and that they have two 
classes in the room, and therefore, cannot take 
one class on an excursion. This is probably all 
true, but underneath the argument there is an as- 
sumption that some other work is of greater im- 
portance than the field work in geography. We 
- shall-not argue relative importance, but simply 
state that if geography is worth doing at all, it is 
worth doing right. And let us repeat that geog- 
raphy in the past has been a formal study because 
teachers have kept away from earth and life and 
have clung tenaciously to the text book. Schools
-P-A-G-E-214
  212 e THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
of the best type do not assume to teach chemistry 
or physics, unless they have some sort of labor- 
atory and a workable amount of apparatus. This 
equipment costs considerable, but it is supplied. 
Then, too, double periods must be arranged for 
hehaxatory practice, but again the program yields 
to the pressure. When grade teachers become 
convinced that field work is highly profitable, and 
when they become resourceful enough to interest 
boys and girls out of doors, then we may expect 
better things: Superintendents recognize the 
value of this phase of geography. The writer has 
often experienced the recoil of otherwise willing 
teachers when they were asked to do some field 
work. It is also said that the discipline is diffi- 
cult, but the teacher who lacks in resources finds 
it equally difficult to keep order inside. The school 
garden, agriculture, nature study, geography— 
these all make new demands upon the teacher; he 
must be equal to the occasion—must arise to the 
opportunity. 
It may be said of nature study that it has not 
been systematic, but the difficulty lies not in na- 
ture. It may be some time before the great body 
of teachers become proficient in the study of sci- 
ence at first hand, but the only alternative is to 
walk in the light we already have and pray for 
more. 
‘Would one become proficient in physiography, 
then what can take the place of a well-directed 
trip to Dune Park, Indiana; to Blue Mounds in 
the Driftless Area of Wisconsin; to the Baraboo
-P-A-G-E-215
VALUE OF ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS 213 
Ranges and Devils Lake; to Fort Snelling, at the 
junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, 
St. Paul, Minnesota; to Minnehaha Falls in Min- 
neapolis; or to Starved Rock on the Illinois river? 
These are a few of the places of much physio- 
graphic interest in the Upper Mississippi Valley. 
A score of others almost as inviting could be 
named. And if the teacher is more ambitious, the 
National Park, Grand Cafion, the Park and the 
Selkirk Mountains are yet his to explore. 
But field work is not beyond the possibility of 
any city, village or country school. The outlook 
may be less inspiring and the proportions com- 
paratively mean, but it is quite safe to assert that 
within a single mile of most schools, nature dis- 
plays phenomena as truly valuable and equally 
as illustrative as are those more picturesque and 
stupendous works of nature. ‘‘Despise not, then, 
the little things.’’? Here are some of the physio- 
graphic features common to most rural schools. 
Visit any that are near. 
1. River, creek, or brook. The excursion 
should be made for the purpose of studying one 
or two definite features, and just at a time when 
the concrete material is needed. The purpose of 
the trip might be to study one or more of the fol- 
lowing: flood plains; deltas; terraces; corrasion; 
meanders, ete. 
2. Hills and valleys, as results of erosion. 
3. Guillies and ditches—along country high- 
ways. Methods of checking. 
4. Hills, showing effects of erosion when un-

der cultivation. Compare cultivated hillside with 
. meadow or pastures of similar slope. 
5. Soils. Collect specimens of soils from dif- 
ferent fields. Compare. Preserve samples of ' 
sandy soils, clay soils, loam, vegetable mold, ete. 
6. Visit.a gravel pit. Collect specimens of 
rocks and glacial pebbles for your museum. 
7. Coal mine or coal bank. Study method of 
mining. Teach lessons on coal. Collect fossils 
for museum. 
8. ‘Stone quarry. Collett specimens. Study 
stratification, faulting, ete. 
9. Clay pit. Preserve specimen. 
10. Lake shore. Study shore features, wave 
action, ete., ete. 
All schools will not have the same or equal ad- 
vantages for field work, but each should make the 
most of its opportunities. The rural teacher who 
ean take his whole school to the roadside to study 
wild fiowers, insects, birds, the action of frost or 
the work of running water, has an advantage over 
a city teacher, who with a larger school must 
make a longer journey, to come in contact with 
nature at first hand. But all cities and many 
towns offer good advantages for the study of 
manufacturing industries and commerce. The 
superintendent should assist his teachers in select- 
ing for study those things which can be made 
interesting and profitable, and every earnest 
teacher who will try repeatedly will grow and in 
the end will succeed.

12. VALUE OF ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS 215 
SUGGESTIONS AND QUESTIONS. 
. Why are museums and excursions necessary to the best geog- 
raphy teaching? Without them what would probably be the 
character of the instruction? 
. What effect on the pupil’s interest would the formation of a 
museum have? Is it possible for any school to secure a 
museum ? 
What are the opportunities for industrial excursions in your 
vicinity? 
. How would you plan and conduct an excursion? 
. Enumerate the field trips conveniently near your school that 
would be of value to your pupils. 
. Characterize the knowledge gained phrough excursions with that 
gained from books alone. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY. 
. Select some field or plot of ground that is conveniently located 
for study. 
. Study the soils during their preparation for, planting. Are 
they clay, loam or sand? Do they permit of easy cultivation? 
. Observe the growing crops. Do all parts of the field equally 
favor the growth of plants? 
Do the soils maintain moisture well? Is the cultivation con- 
ducive to preservation of moisture? 
Is the plot subject to ‘‘wash’’? How does this affect the fer- 
tility of its parts? Examine soils in different places. 
Are there different crops on the plot? Which seems to thrive 
best? 
Does the season’s temperature seem to be right for the grow- 
ing crops? 
Is the rainfall just adequate? 
Do the winds affect the growing crops? In what way? 
Have the growing crops animal or plant enemies? 
. Observe the crop until maturity. Is the crop consumed by the 
producer or is it marketed? If sold, at what market? How 
transported? Was the product ready for use, or did it have te 
undergo manufacture? If it required manufacture, where and 
how was it aecomplished? 
Write an essay discussing the factors that enter into crop 
production in your locality.

CHAPTER XIX. 
Suecrstions oN WEATHER STUDY. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Of what value is weather study; helps for the teachers; how to 
make simple apparatus; suggestive exercises with the helior; 
exercises to show atmospheric pressure; how to show convec- 
tion currents in air and water; hints on the study of cyclones; 
suggestive exercises based on the daily weather map; exercises. 
to show that air absorbs and deposits moisture; the two forms 
‘of heat energy. 
Suggestions on the study of wind velocities, state of sky, and rain- 
fall; how to keep a weather record. 
Weather study may be made a part of the na- 
ture study or of the geography proper. It should 
be kept up throughout the year. Often a few min- 
utes—two or three minutes daily—are sufficient. 
There is no phase of geography more practical 
than weather study. There are many ridiculous 
signs and superstitions relating to weather 
changes, and the teacher has a fine opportunity 
to do much good by teaching a few scientific facts 
in elementary meteorology. The following mate- 
rials and helps, most of which are free, are recom- 
mended. Teachers are urged to secure them for 
their schools: 
1. The Daily Weather Map. This should come 
to every school, especially if on a rural de-

lis L. Moore.

“The Weather Bureau,’’? U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 
Some simple apparatus will also be very help- 
ful and some of it, at least, can be made in the 
school. 
1. A Thermometer. Every school should have 
a thermometer for the purpose of regulating the 
school room temperature. A chemical thermom- 
eter will answer a double purpose. 
2. A Mercurial Barometer. This instrument 
costs several dollars, but a fairly good one can be 
made for 75 cents. Its construction will furnish 
a motive for manual training work. 
A home-made barometer would be a valuable 
contribution to a school. Study Circular F.

Directions for making. Close one end of a glass 
tube 42 inches long and 14, inch in diameter, using 
a gas or alcohol flame to soften the glass. About 
34 inches from the closed end make a ‘‘U’’ shaped 
bend. Slowly pour in mercury (about 2 pounds 
will be required) until both arms of the 
tube are filled.* A piece of rubber tub- 
ing, one end of which is fitted to the 
open arm of the glass tube and the other 
attached to a funnel, affords a conve- 
nient method for introducing the mer- 
cury. Incline the glass tube toward a 
horizontal position while pouring in 
the mercury. When both arms are filled, 
place the tube in a vertical position and 
mount on a smooth board on which is a 
scale in inches and centimeters. 
The true reading of the barometer 
will be the difference between the 
heights of the two mercurial columns. 
Hang the instrument in a safe place. 
Read it daily. 
3. A Helior or Sun Board. This 
little instrument can be made by. the 
Fig.6 teacher or older pupils of the class. 
It is a good piece of work for manual training, and 
can be used to excellent advantage in establishing 
basal ideas of temperature. Directions: From 
1%” wood make a square tube 3x3” inside meas- 
urement and 10” long. Prepare a base-board   
    
*If advantages permit, the mercury in the tube may be boiled to 
drive out any bubbles of air. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  220 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
36’x4”, using 1” material. To its edges attach a 
1%” vertical strip 36”x5”. By means of light 
hinges attached to one end of the tube, fasten it 
to the middle of the base-board. The tube should 
be so adjusted that when moved its side will just 
touch the vertical strip. 
Secure a cheap protractor, or make one from 
light card-board, and fasten it to the side of the 
helior tube as shown in Fig. 7. A short plumb 
line properly attached to the protractor will, as 
it crosses the are, indicate the inclination of the 
tube. A light metal strip, one end of which is fas- 
tened to the tube and the other to the sliding block 
[see cut], will hold the tube at any desired angle. 
  
  Fig. 7. 
4. A Hygrometer, or Wet and Dry Bulb Ther- 
mometer. Two cheap thermometer tubes attached 
side by side to a small board will answer if a 
better form cannot be had. Around the bulb of 
one thermometer wrap one end of a lamp-wick, 
immersing the other end of the wick in water held 
in a small bottle, also attached to the board. The 
other bulb will be exposed to the moisture of the
-P-A-G-E-223
SUGGESTIONS ON WEATHER STUDIES 221 
atmosphere only. A table from which the relative 
and absolute humidities can be obtained may be 
found in a book on meteorology. 
5. A Rain Gauge. A can with perpendicular 
sides set ‘‘in the open’’ will answer the purpose 
of a rain gauge in approximating the rainfall. 
Cireular No. 250, ‘‘Instructions for Voluntary 
Observers,’’ gives full information. (See p. 218.) 
SIMPLE EXERCISES WITH THE HELIOR. 
1. Set the helior in the sun at noon in a level, 
north-south position, and so adjust the tube that 
all sides are lighted directly by the sun. This 
position is secured when shadows are absent. If 
the tube is too high, a shadow will appear on its 
upper surface; if too low, on its lower surface, 
ete. Now the angle shown between the lower edge 
of the tube and the base-board will represent the 
noon altitude of the sun. If the middle point of 
the protractor are be designated zero, the mar- 
ginal number at the intersection of the plumb-line 
and are will indicate the numerical value of the 
sun’s altitude. 
2. With the helior tube in the position indi- 
eated in 1, note the lighted rectangular area 
within the shaded boundary lines. Determine the 
length and width of this area. The beam of sun- 
light that enters the tube will be projected upon a 
surface as wide as the tube, and will vary in length 
lwith the altitude of the sun. 
Now if the sun’s rays were vertical, a surface
-P-A-G-E-224
  
  222 ' THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
of 9 square inches would receive all of the light 
and heat entering the mouth of the helior tube. 
The altitude of the sun would in this case be 90°. 
As the sun never reaches this altitude north of 
the Tropic of Cancer, the light and heat entering 
the tube will be distributed over a rectangular 
surface somewhat larger than 9 square. inches. 
Thus on September 23—the autumnal equinox— 
the noon altitude of the sun at Platteville, Wis- 
consin, is approximately 47°. At noon on this 
date the helior, with dimensions as given above, 
will show a lighted area of 1314 square inches. 
It is evident that the intensity of light and heat 
will then be two-thirds as great at 43° north lati- 
tude as at the equator.* 
From the above exercise, pupils will under- 
stand why the more nearly vertical rays between 
the tropics make that region hotter than other re- 
gions, and why it is called the Torrid Zone. 
3. Properly adjust the helior tube to show the 
area heated and lighted at nine o’clock. Compare 
with area heated and lighted at twelve o’clock, 
and again at four p.m. At what hour do we re- 
ceive the more nearly vertical rays? The earth is 
receiving the maximum of heat at this hour, but 
the thermometer will register higher at two or 
three p. m., as more heat at that time will be radi- 
ated by the earth into the atmosphere.

of ane since at an altitude of 47° a 
beam of light and heat is distributed over $the area that it would be 
were the altitude 90°, it follows that the thtensity will be only 2 as 
great. ‘

understanding the temperature of different parts 
of the earth’s surface.

  SIMPLE EXERCISES TO SHOW ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, 
1. Fill a basin with water. Press a bottle, 
mouth downward, into the water. Why does not 
the bottle fill? Does this show air pressure? 
2. Fill a bottle with water. Hold the hand 
over the mouth and invert. Lower the mouth of 
the bottle into water and remove the hand. Why 
does the water remain in the bottle? Does this 
show air pressure? If so, in what direction? 
3. Fill a bottle (level full) with water. Press 
with the palm of the hand a piece of heavy writing 
paper evenly over its mouth. Holding the hand 
in this position invert the bottle and carefully 
remove the hand. Why does not the water run? 
Does this show air pressure? In what direction? 
EXERCISES TO SHOW CONVECTION CURRENTS. 
1. Heat a beaker of water in which a little 
sawdust has been placed, by applying a flame to
-P-A-G-E-226
  ‘ 
224 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
the bottom of the glass near one side. In what 
direction does the water directly over the flame 
move? In what direction is it moving on the other 
side of the glass? Why? Is a circuit established? 
How will all of the water become heated? 
2. School rooms heated by stoves illustrate 
convection currents. Show by experiment that 
the air above the stove rises; that the air on the 
floor flows toward the stove. With the school 
thermometer, take the temperatures on the floor 
and near the ceiling. Trace some of the circuits 
of the air in the school room. 
CONVECTION CURRENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 35 
CYCLONES. 
The great storms that pass over the country 
with considerable regularity are cyclones. Cor- 
rect the current notion that the violent de- 
structive storms are cyclones; they are tornadoes. 
Cyclones, or cyclonic storms, are shown on all 
weather maps of the United States. But in order 
to teach the use of the Daily Weather Map, one 
rather difficult notion must be developed, viz., the 
idea of atmospheric or barometric pressure. The 
teacher even without the mercurial barometer will 
be able, little by little, to establish the idea. 
Air surrounds the earth to a depth of two hun- 
dred miles or more, but almost half of it is 
within three miles of the earth’s surface. Now 
when the air is considerably heated over a large 
area, it rises in the same manner that it does over
-P-A-G-E-227
  SUGGESTIONS ON WEATHER STUDIES 225 
the stove in the school room. The upward move- 
ment of air reduces the downward pressure below 
it and may be, therefore, one cause of a low.* But 
  the air having risen, forms a swell down the sides 
of which the upper portions slowly flow. Thus the 
horizontal motion of the upper currents is away 
from: the low, toward areas over which the air is 
less disturbed by heat; here it slowly settles, the 
weight of the added upper layers pressing the 
lower ones into thinner and thinner strata. This 
increased mass and downward motion of the air 
cause greater pressure. Atmospheric regions of 
this kind are highs or anticyclones. 
Owing to the earth’s rotation, surface currents 
always flow spirally upward from regions of 
greater to regions of less pressure. These incom- 
ing spiral currents form a great whirl or eddy in 
which the air slowly rises, its velocity increasing 
as the center is approached. Such an upward 
whirl is generally a low or cyclone. In the cy- 
clonic whirl, the movement is always to the right, 
*It is not to be inferred that temperature disturbances eo the 
origin of cyclones. See About the Weather, Harrington, p.  
-P-A-G-E-228
  226 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
in the northern hemisphere. Upward currents of 
air always expand and cool, hence it usually rains 
in low pressure areas. A falling barometer sig- 
nifies low pressure and therefore a storm. 
Downward currents of air are always being 
warmed as a result (1) of their approach to land 
or water which is warmer than the upper air, and 
(2) of the increased air pressure at lower levels. 
The increased pressure condenses the air and as it 
is condensed, heat is set free. A large area of 
slowly settling air is called a high. As the tem- 
perature of such air rises, its capacity for mois- 
ture increases. Precipitation is not likely to occur 
and, in general, highs indicate fair weather. 
Older students can be taught the meaning of 
isobars and isotherms from the weather map. 
Our prevailing winds are westerlies. A sudden 
shift of the wind to the east indicates the ap- 
proach of a storm from the west. The shift will 
be accompanied also by a falling barometer, and 
it can easily be noted that the temperature is 
rising. Correct the prevalent notion that a hu- 
mid, cloudy, or foggy atmosphere is heavy. Mois- 
ture settles when the air is unable to buoy it up. 
No more practical lesson can be learned than 
that of forecasting the weather a day or two 
ahead. Pupils in the upper grades can do this by 
observing direction of winds, state of sky, tem- 
perature, and pressure. Teach children that the 
long-range forecasts seen so often in the local 
newspapers are unreliable. 
Teach the children how to tell whether the 
y

SUGGESTIONS ON WEATHER STUDIES 227. 
storm centers pass north or south of their locality. 
Since winds blow toward the low or storm, if the 
wind is east, the storm is west. If the wind is 
south, the storm is north. If the wind is south- 
west, the storm is northeast. If the wind is west, 
the storm is east. Hence, in this instance, the 
storm center passed north of the observer. 
Hence— 
1. If the wind shifts from the east to the west by 
way of the south, the storm center passes north of 
the observer. 
2. If the wind shifts from the east to the west by 
way of the north, the storm center passes south of 
the observer. 
Teacher and pupils should observe the shifting 
winds and make inferences relative to the paths 
of cyclonic storms. 
Since winds flow in spirally to the storm center 
it follows that— 
East winds start in the south. 
South winds start in the west. 
West winds start in the north. 
North winds start in the east. 
SIMPLE SUGGESTIVE EXERCISES FOR STUDY OF 
CYCLONIC STORMS. 
1. Cut a 2” square from transparent paper. 
Lay the square directly over the word ‘‘Low’’ on 
a weather map. Trace the word ‘‘Low”’ and the 
arrows about it that indicate wind directions. 
Transfer the square to another ‘‘Low’’ and make

the two words coincide. Trace in the arrows 
again. Repeat for four or five lows. What do 
you conclude as to wind directions near lows? 
2. On an outline map of the United States 
show by an isobar the location of a low on succes- 
sive days as it crosses the continent. Make a

each 24 hours. Average a dozen measurements 
to secure the approximate velocity of cyclones. 
3. Trace several isotherms through lows found 
in the Mississippi basin. Note the bends which 
the isotherms make. In what direction do they 
bend in front of the low? In the rear? [See 
Fig. 9.] Remembering what has been said about 
wind directions, account for these bends. Why 
are our west winds cool in summer and cold in 
winter? :

cross the country. In which direction from the 
cyclonic center is the largest cloud and rain area? 
Which wind brings the most moisture? Why? 
From what source does most of our moisture 
come? 
5. Note the clouds frequently. Learn the dif- 
ferent classes by reference to the Cloud Chart.

Note the moisture that collects on the outer sur- 
face. Where did the moisture come from? Why 
did it collect?

quantities of water. Set the dishes near each 
other—one in the sunshine and the other in the 
shade. Compare the times required for evapora-

SIMPLE EXERCISES TO SHOW FORMS OF HEAT, ENERGY. 
1. Set an open dish of cold water on the stove 
or place it over an alcohol flame. Introduce the 
bulb of a thermometer and take the reading. 
Have pupils note the rise of mercury as the water 
heats. Take the reading when the water boils. 
Continue to apply heat. Does the mercury con- 
tinue to rise after the water boils? Can water 
be heated beyond the boiling point in open ves- 
sels? Is evaporation rapid at this temperature? 
Hold a piece of cold glass above the vessel and 
note the collection of vapor on it. What becomes of 
heat energy after the water boils. Is there much 
heat, then, in vapor? If the vapor be condensed, 
can this heat (latent) be set free? Which burns 
more severely, boiling water or steam? Why?

A Sky 3-10 to 7-10 cloudy is marked Fair. 
A Sky over 7-10 cloudy is marked Cloudy. 
If the teacher follows the suggestions concerning 
the securing of a cloud-chart, the pupils will soon 
learn the principal kinds of clouds, and a column 
can be added to the weather record under the 
heading, ‘‘ Kinds of Clouds.’’

RAINFALL, 
Under this term are included rain, hail, sleet, 
and snow. Precipitation is the term usually em- 
ployed. Rainfall is measured in inches. About ten 
inches of snow give one inch of water, but there 
is much variation in the density of snow. 
THE WEATHER RECORD. 
Rule a large sheet of paper, as suggested below, 
for a ‘‘Weather Record.’’ Fill in daily with ob- 
served data. Each pupil in the upper grades 
should ‘‘rule off’? pages in his geography note 
book, and keep an individual weather record.

A column headed ‘‘Barometric Pressure’’ may

to make the barometer, and also a hygrometer. If 
the latter be made, a column headed ‘‘Humidity’’ 
may appear in the weather record.* ;

SUGGESTIONS AND QUESTIONS. 
. Of what importance to the pupil is a study of the weather? 
. Is there any excuse for simply talking about the weather? 
What should the teacher do? 
. What pieces of helpful apparatus can be made in the school? 
Is there any value in making them rather than buying them? 
. How can you measure the altitude of the sun? How ean you 
show children that the more nearly vertical rays of the sun 
yield more heat and light than rays less nearly vertical? 
. What is a convection current? Why should we develop this 
idea with pupils? What relations do convection currents bear 
to planetary winds? Explain fully. 
. What is a-cyclonie storm? Is this expression often misused? 
. What transformation in heat energy accompanies the con- 
densation of moisture? The vaporization of water? The 
freezing of water? The melting of ice? Can you apply the 
principle involved in each case to weather temperatures?

40° south latitude? 
2. Demonstrate: The intensity of heat and light varies with 
the altitude of the syn.

the sun at what altitude? 
5. Knowing the day of the month, if given the observer’s lati- 
tude, can you find the sun’s altitude? If given the sun’s 
altitude, can you find the observer’s latitude? Make problems 
to illustrate. 
6. Draw a 1”. square to represent the distribution of sunshine 
at noon on the equator at equinoctial time. Using the same 
seale, draw figures to: show the distribution of sunshine at 
latitudes 20°, 40°, 60°, and 80° north or south latitude. Vary 
the exercises.

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Maps; what are the characteristics of good maps?' classification 
of maps. 
Map drawing; requirements of good map drawing exercises; illus- 
trations. 
The use of government maps; value of; illustrative exercise. 
The value of good school atlases; the use of; an illustrative exer- 
cise. 
Outline maps and graphs. 
Models; how to make paper pulp models; salt and flour models; 
sand models; plasticine models; chalk and pencil models, 
The school that is wholly without maps cannot 
secure the best results in geography and history. 
Teachers should acquire a better understanding of 
maps; a keener appreciation of their value and use 
will follow. Then, too, with maps as with other 
necessaries of school equipment, if the teacher ap- 
preciates and makes use of the materials and ap- 
paratus at hand, he is at the same time making it 
easier to secure additions. 
Maps are symbolical representations of geo- 
graphical truth. They show distribution of fea- 
tures upon a flat surface. There is great economy 
in their use, since the desired truth can be imme- 
diately pointed out without any reference or recog-

  236 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
nition of the other features shown. They are 
therefore time savers and some one has termed 
them ‘‘shorthand records.”’ 
The study of cartography becomes a science in 
itself, so that only the elemental facts concerning 
map-projection is likely to be mastered by teach- , 
ers not specializing in geography. But all teach- 
ers need the help of maps, and, like their watches, 
should make good use of them even if the tech- 
nique of map-making is not perfectly understood, 
For the benefit of beginners, especially, the essen- 
tials of a good map may be enumerated. A good 
map should— 
1. Betruthful. That is, it should first of all be 
recognized as the work of a skilled cartogra- 
pher. This insures a proper projection and 
as much accuracy in details and distribu- 
*tion of features as is possible when a large 
area is reduced to so small a scale. It 
should be revised and up to date. The ex- 
aggerations should be minimized. 
2. Be distinct. Distinctness insures easy in- 
terpretation or reading. By comparing a 
few maps of different make, one will soon 
discover great differences in this respect. 
In teaching it is necessary for the entire 
class to study a map at once, and hence at 
some little distance, a thing quite impossi- 
ble and perhaps injurious to the eyes, if the 
map is lacking in clearness. Poor systems 
of lettering and coloring, together with the
-P-A-G-E-239

  MAPS AND MODELS 237 
representation of too much on a single map, 
lead to confusion and indistinctness. In 
selecting maps, teachers and school officers 
should keep the above points in mind. 
Employ conventionalized symbols, viz., 
those in common use. The spelling, es- 
pecially, should be that approved by geo- 
graphical societies. 
CLASSIFICATION OF MAPS, 
Political Map, which shows on a flat surface 
the horizontal forms and distribution of 
features with particular attention to arti- 
ficial boundaries. 
Outline Map, which is a political map with 
nomenclature omitted. 
Relief Map, which shows on a flat surface 
both horizontal and vertical irregularities 
of land masses. There are three kinds in 
common use, the difference being in the 
symbols employed in showing vertical va- 
riations. Elevations are shown by (1) Con- 
tours (2) Colors, (3) Light and Shade. 
Each plan has its particular advantages. 
Model, which is an actual miniature repro- 
duction of some land form. It is very use- 
ful but cannot be very correct. Horizontal 
irregularities are much simplified through 
great reduction in scale, and vertical irreg- 
ularities greatly exaggerated to make them 
appeal to the eye—to be distinct.

238 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
MAP DRAWING. 
It would be a platitude to expatiate on the value 
of map drawing. Its value is conceded by all. 
The map is a diagrammatic or graphic way of ex- 
pressing ideas. 
But what exercises in map drawing are most 
valuable? The suggestions here given are the out- 
growth of years of experience in teaching and ob- 
serving children of all ages. At the outset the 
mechanical exercise of copying maps is of the 
least value. That it impresses form and relative 
location and magnitude is true, but these ends can 
be reached through exercises involving more 
thought. The best map exercise is one that re- 
quires (1) the interpretation of one map and (2) 
the expression of the mental picture in an entirely 
new set of map symbols. This exercise is very 
practical and permits of much variation. To illus- 
trate: 
(a) Interpret a United States Geological Sur- 
vey (contour) map and express the mental 
picture by the use of light and shade. In 
this manner reproduce the region ‘shown in 
the Ottawa sheet, or a portion ofthe Kaibab | 
sheet. 
Carefully study the surface of France. 
Sketch the outline and color as follows: (b 
aS 
1. All surface having an elevation of 500 feet 
or less, light green. (Use water colors.) 
2, All surface having an elevation of 500-1,000 
feet, light yellow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  MAPS AND MODELS 239 
3. All surface having an elevation of 1,000- 
2,000 feet, deep yellow. 2 
4. All surface having an elevation of 2,000- 
5,000 feet, light brown. 
All elevations above 5,000 feet, dark brown. ou 
Study the text and examine the political 
map of some region. Having gained a good 
mental picture, express it in contours, in 
colors or in light and shade. (e 
wa 
Map drawing in which geometrical figures or 
“nets’? are employed to fix definitely certain 
points are highly recommended by many teachers. 
To the writer it seems that the attention of the 
pupil must necessarily be drawn from the idea he 
would express to the machinery of expression, and 
that the so-called ‘‘nets’’ simply add to the formal 
element of map drawing. Since the plan em- 
phasizes the use of meridians and parallels, ‘‘the 
real ground work of maps,’’ it certainly would 
tend to keep the pupil oriented, and so far as the 
practical value of location is concerned would be 
commendable. : 
UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS. 
The most scientific map is the topographic map 
published by the United States Geological Survey. 
The atlas sheets are accurate and cheap, and 
should be more generally used. Below is given a 
map of this character on a much reduced scale. It 
represents a portion of the campus of the Western

by a pupil as a part of the field work.* 
“It is to be regretted that teachers generally 
know so little of the educational value of the topo- 
graphic map. Ultimately the entire United States 
will be surveyed and mapped. The national gov- 
ernment, co-operating with various state govern- 
ments, is prosecuting the work as fast as possible.

The topographic map can be used to good ad- 
vantage in the eighth, ninth, tenth and higher 
grades. Topographic Folios 1 and 2, treating of

advantage by any class attempting the study of 
physical geography.

  MAPS AND MODELS 241 
Each folio contains several map sheets and brief ‘ 
descriptions of the various types. The teacher 
will add considerable to his equipment for teach- 
ing by himself mastering the maps. In small 
schools, eighth grade pupils can use these maps to 
good advantage, as can also large grammar 
schools, providing enough maps can be had to sup- 
ply the class. Teachers who have interpreted the 
maps can readily prepare questions for the pupils. 
Hoping that some teachers will introduce this 
work in their classes, suggestive exercises are here 
given on two sheets which are included in Folio 1 
—above mentioned. 
Interested teachers will obtain added help by 
securing the pamphlet, ‘‘The Use of Governmental 
Maps in Schools,’’ by Davis, King and Collie,* 
and ‘‘Monograph 60’’ (U. 8. Geological Survey),

ILLUSTRATIVE EXERCISE. 
Based Upon Longman’s New School Atlas. 
The use of maps should not be restricted to mere 
location. Every school should have a copy of 
Longman’s New School Atlas. So far as possible, 
originate problems requiring map-interpretation 
and inference. Such exercises necessitate genuine 
thought-work and insure correct generalizations. 
The better geographies have maps showing rain- 
fall, vegetation, distribution of products, density 
of population, commercial maps, etc. Suppose the 
teacher state the problem: 
What Relationship exists between the Annual 
Rainfall and the Distribution of Forests in the 
United States? 
In order to reach a conclusion certain data must 
be secured, and this can be done quickly and con- 
veniently by reference to the maps.

- is the annual rainfall along this meridian?

sition on ‘‘The Relation of Rainfall to the 
Forests of United States.’’ Additional sub- 
ject for composition: ‘‘Why Are Mountain 
Slopes Usually Forested?’’ 
OUTLINE MAPS. 
Teachers should make free use of ‘‘outline’’ 
maps of the various continents. Such maps can be 
purchased reasonably in quantities (address of 
publishers elsewhere given), or they can be made 
by teacher and pupils by means of a mimeograph, 
simplex, or other duplicator. Now let the prob- 
lem be ‘‘The Distribution of Wheat in the United 
States.’? The pupil reviews his text, and other 
reference books at hand and then shades rather 
deeply with green water color the areas of largest 
production. Again referring to his text to ascer- 
tain the facts, he shades lightly with green the 
areas of medium or light production. 
In similar manner the outline maps can be used 
to show the distribution of other products and re- 
sources. Our best geographies now contain dis- 
tribution maps in limited numbers; the teacher 
should select problems in such a way that the exer- 
cises will not deteriorate into the mere copying of 
maps. To illustrate: Assume that the text con- 
tains separate maps showing distribution of coal 
and corn in United States. The problem may be: 
What part of the Corn Belt is underlaid with 
coal? 
On an outline map draw a light line entirely 
around the corn belt. With water color shade 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
‘UAPS AND MODELS 247 
lightly. Allow the map to dry thoroughly. Now 
with pen and ink parallel-line very neatly those 
areas which abound with coal. The advantage of 
this map is that it presents graphically the co- 
incident areas that produce both corn and coal. 
The impression made is stronger than when the 
eye is compelled to carry one graphic impression 
over to the second map for comparison. By se- 
lecting varieties of symbols a map may become 
cumulative, that is, a number of resources, all or in 
part coincident in their distribution, may be shown 
on one map. Such a map emphasizes the great 
wealth of certain areas, and, incidentally, explains 
the distribution of population. 
ILLUSTRATIVE EXERCISES.

and sugar in the United States. 
2. Show by dotted lines the commercial routes 
of iron ore from Duluth and Superior.

Jines that extend from Chicago to the Pa- 
cite Ocean.

Great Glacier. o 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
245 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
6. Color with rather deep green those regions 
of North America where the altitude is 500 
feet or less. Color with light green the 
areas that are 500 feet to 1,000 feet in alti- 
tude. Color with light yellow the areas that 
are 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet high; with deeper 
yellow areas 2,000 feet to 5,000 feet high; 
and with deep brown all areas over 5,000 
feet in height. 
Nothing will deaden the interest and reduce the 
geography to mere memory work more surely 
and quickly than exclusive daily study and oral 
rehearsal of text-book statements. Such work re- 
duces the pupil to a state of passivity. All state- 
ments look equally important on the printed page. 
The material of a text on geography is to be read, 
weighed and sifted for the ultimate purpose of 
reaching and applying the broad general princi- 
ples of the subject. The text should never be 
learned merely for the sake of reciting it literally. 
STATISTICS, 
Large numbers never bring clear ideas. The 
teaching of statistics is time poorly spent. Teach 
areas of states approximately. Illinois, for exam- 
ple, may be learned exactly. With a map of United 
States before the class, require pupils to refer to 
tables of statistics to find area of Illinois. Now 
look at the map. Find other states about the same 
size as Illinois. Name these states. The pupils 
ean be led to pick Wisconsin, Iowa, New York, 
Alabama, ete. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  
MAPS AND MODELS 249 
These states fall in the 50,000 square miles class, 
differences of 1,000 to 5,000 square miles being 
ignored. 
Estimate area of Colorado. Compare closely 
with Illinois on a United States map. Check by 
referring to table of statistics. Now find other 
states nearly equal in size. Wyoming, New Mex- 
ico, Utah, Nevada, ete., will be named. Select all 
that are from 90,000 to 110,000 square miles, and 
classify with Colorado. Knowing the areas of 
Massachusetts, Illinois and Colorado, pupils in the 
upper grades never need to hesitate in approxi- 
mating areas. The map is a graphic representa- 
tion of comparative areas. It is always wise to 
use some convenient area as that of Colorado as a 
measure for foreign countries. 
In referring to France, pupils should say: 
‘‘Prance is twice as ee as Colorado, or 200,000 
square miles in area.’ 
In comparing populations, productions, vases 
* exports, imports, etc., graphic representations 
should be used. Tifuateang

United States output, and a line 1 inch long would 
represent each of the others.

By the use of cross-section paper (ordinary pa- 
per can be ruled into centimeter squares) very 
significant graphs can be made, which will show 
not only productions, ete., for a given year, but the 
relative increase or decrease of several countries 
through a series of years. For illustrations of 
such graphs teachers should consult one of the 
standard commercial geographies. 
Drill on pertinent statistics can be secured by 
making problems for the arithmetic lesson, which 
involve the selected values. Illustration:

iron is supplied by the United States? 
2. Germany’s output of pig-iron is what per

MAP EXERCISES, 
A little study on the part of the teacher will 
suggest numerous problems which the pupils can 
answer by reference to maps. Such exercises are 
recommended strongly since it is the conviction of 
the writer that pupils make too little use of maps 
generally. The following exercises suggested by 
Prof. A. W. Andrews will be found helpful :* 
“From a map without names showing elevation 
by shades of color, such as the Diagram Hand Map 
of the London District, to find the position of the 
chief towns at the gaps of the North Downs. : 
From a similar map of France to find the possi- 
ble lines of march of Cesar. 
From a similar map of India to show the regions 
of excessive rainfall. 
From a similar map of South America to show 
the direction of the rain-bearing winds in the Ama- 
zon valley. 
From maps of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans 
showing prevailing winds in January and July, to 
‘work out the winds likely to reach the land with 
an excess or deficiency of moisture, or to show the 
route of Columbus. 
From maps of Africa showing rainfall in Janu- 
ary and July to show the regions of permanent 
tropical forest, of savanna with an area extended 
or diminished according to rainfall, and of perma- 
nent desert.

MODELS, 
The making of models is an excellent means of 
securing better notions of surface features. 
Printed descriptions lose force with children. 
Even if geographies contain good relief maps, the 
construction of a model will necessitate a more 
careful study of the relief map, and the mechanical 
work will deepen the impression. Better still, all 
such work makes the pupils doers rather than 
passive receivers.

stand for two or three days. Drain off excess 
water. Then thoroughly work with a sharpened 
wood paddle until mixture becomes a thick, pliable 
mass. If thoroughly worked it is now ready for 
modeling. The outline of the map should previ- 
ously have been made. Paper pulp models will 
keep well. Blue water-colors may represent bodies 
of water. Varnish or shellac will enable the model 
to resist moisture. 
SALT AND FLOUR MODELS. 
Good models can be made from a mixture of two 
parts of common salt and one of flour. Mix well 
(dry) between thumb and fingers. Add water very 
slowly, mixing all of the time. Continue until mix- 
ture has the consistency of wet sand. It is now 
ready for use. 
The outline of the country should previously 
have been prepared. An easy way is to trace the 
outline from a text-book map, using transparent 
paper. This can be done quickly. Now lay this 
copy on a piece of cardboard (pasteboard boxes 
in every home can be had), and trace again with 
hard pencil or stylus. This imprints the outline 
on the cardboard, upon which the model is to be 
made. Apply the salt and flour mixture, spread- 
ing very thin, and covering completely over the 
area to be modeled. Now add more of the mix- 
ture to build plateaus and mountains. A flexible 
ease knife is convenient to spread mixture. The 
thumb and fingers are good tools for mountain 
building. Relief maps from which to model are

found in all of the better geographies. Shiny card- 
board may be brushed over with library paste 
before applying the mixture. This insures ad-

discuss the surface with them. Mountains, 
plateaus, and lowlands should be pointed out. 
Rivers can be scratched in with a pencil point 
while mixture is moist. Do not use too much of 
the mixture. The -cardboard will absorb the 
moisture and become so weakened that model may

erack in handling. Light pine board may be used 
for the base. Water bodies adjacent to continent 
may be shown with blue water colors. 
After the first time, children can prepare models 
at home. South America is a good continent with 
which to begin. Keep the models dry. A coating 
of shellac will help preserve them. 
_ This exercise is very practical and highly com- 
mended. 
Observe the model of North America made from 
the salt and flour mixture. 
SAND MODELS, 
There is no excuse for not modeling land forms. 
A modeling board 2 feet x 3 feet or 3 feet x 4 feet, 
with a rim 2 inches or 3 inches high, and two or 
three pails of sand, completes the requirements. 
Sand models can be made quickly and, as the mate- 
rial costs nothing, larger models can be made than 
was practicable with other material. 
PLASTICINE MODELS, 
Plasticine is a commercial modeling material. 
Circulars describing it and giving directions as to 
its use can be had on application.* Plasticine can 
be used over and over again. It can be used in 
geographical, historical and manual training 
work. 
Procedure: ‘‘Flatten pieces of gray plasticine 
between finger and thumb, and press upon the pa-

MAPS AND MODELS 257 
per to the shape of the coast line or country (a 
slight ‘pencil outline may be used if desired). To 
make mountains, roll pieces of paper into a ball 
and cover with thin flattened plasticine; add more 
for elevation of headlands, cliffs, ete. Depress the 
valleys by finger, and channels of rivers and 
gorges by tool. . . . The plasticine has to be 
applied by pressure, not spread like butter. Take 
the needle tool and, holding it like a pencil, draw 
round the outline, cutting through to the paper, 
strip the paper off the back, and model stands 
clear; place it upon the clean surface of slate, 
board, or tin tray, go again round your contours 
with tool and finger to secure greater accuracy 
and detail.’’ 
“The colored plasticine can be introduced at 
this stage for the natural characteristics, such as 
lakes, mountains, etec.’’ 
“Introduce chips or real stone, chalk, coal, ete., 
imbedded in the plasticine to express the geologi- 
eal formation of the neighborhood, and account 
for the character of the beaches and river-beds by 
the disintegration of adjoining strata. These ex- 
ercises give great life and interest to local map- 
making. Cut out ponds, lakes, and reservoirs, and 
insert blue plasticine, mirror or tin-foil for water. 
Chalk, cotton, wool or silk can also be pressed into 
service to show snow mountains, water falls, or 
voleanoes. Water does not affect plasticine; it can 
be poured over the model in the tray to show ac- 
tion of tides, fountains and rivers.’’

ing relief is one of the most practical, as the 
pupil’s equipment is so simple. Children love to 
work with the hands and very soon acquire the 
ability to make excellent light and shade maps. 
In performing the work the crayon or pencil 
is held in an almost horizontal position between
-P-A-G-E-261

the thumb and forefingers. When the pencil is 
used it should be very soft, with long ‘‘lead’’ 
exposed. Rub the pencil back and forth on rough 
paper until it is somewhat flattened. Ordinary 
drawing paper is a good surface upon which to 
make the pencil model, though scratch paper or 
light brown wrapping paper does well. No de- 
tailed directions for executing the work can here 
be given. A few suggestions may help the be- 
ginner: 
Avoid lines with. point of pencil; the strokes 
should be with the side of the lead. 
Successive strokes should blend. 
Horizontal strokes will represent level surfaces; 
oblique strokes, sloping surfaces, and ver- 
tical strokes, vertical surfaces. 
Successively higher altitudes are shown by rela- 
tively deeper and deeper shadings. 
Mountain ridges are usually represented with 
rather heavy strokes on one slope and light 
strokes on the other slope. 
The height of mountain chains is represented 
by the length of the oblique strokes. Rela- 
tively longer and shorter strokes will rep- 
resent relatively higher and lower moun- 
tain ridges. 
Land at or near sea-level is very lightly shaded. 
Note the illustrative pencil model of South 
America.

SuaGEstions oN THE Srupy oF SoILs. 
TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
The study of soils; the origin of soils; character of soils de- 
pendent largely on aqueous bed-rock; law of deposition; 
the case of the Blue Grass region. 
Transported soils; alluvial, glacial drift, loess; short descrip- 
tions of each; the Mississippi delta; the prairie plains; the 
loess of lower Mississippi valley. 
Importance of maintaining the productive capacity of soils; ele- 
ments of soil fertility; the new interest in agriculture. 
The teacher of elementary geography should 
have some knowledge of soils. Any technical 
study of soils belongs, of course, to agriculture; 
but there are considerations wholly within the 
province of geography, a knowledge of which is 
quite essential to. one who essays to teach gram- 
mar school geography. 
Many text books of geography make formal 
statements concerning the soils of a state or 
region, but the necessity for brevity forbids any 
explanation of why the soils of said state or region 
are good or poor. It rests with the teacher to 
supplement and make significant the brief denota- 
tive statements of the text. 
Teachers should know that soil is rock waste 
mixed with more or less organic matter. This 
261
-P-A-G-E-264
  262 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
being true, no adequate understanding of soils is 
possible without some consideration of the rocks 
whose decomposition yields the soils. By far the 
larger portion of soils is the product of sedimen- 
tary rocks. If, perchance, we know the condi- 
tions under which the rocks were deposited, we 
shall have a key to the character of the soils which 
the rocks will yield. 
Sedimentary rocks are aqueous rocks; that is, 
they were formed from materials deposited in a 
body of water. But a body of water, be it lake or 
sea, will be either shallow or deep; or, the same 
body of water may be shallow in one part and deep 
in another. In general, water is shallow near 
shore lines and deep some distance out. The waste 
of the adjacent lands is carried by streams into 
the water body. Now it is evident that heavy 
materials will settle quickly to the sea bottom and 
therefore such deposition will be along the shores. 
As finer waste of the lands settle more slowly sea- 
currents carry such materials farther out from 
shore before deposition occurs. When an old sea- 
bed is lifted and drained we should therefore ex- 
pect to find the fine grained rocks at some distance 
from the old shores, and the coarse textured rocks 
near them. 
It appears therefore that there is a sorting of 
the sediments, the order of deposition beginning 
with the coarsest and ending with the finest. These 
aqueous deposits will in time become rock through 
the agencies of pressure and cementation. But 
should the sea-bed be lifted, the rocks in time will

   ; THE STUDY OF SOILS 263 - 
decompose and the resulting soils will be charac- 
terized by them. We should hardly expect good 
soils from the rocks and gravels which come from 
the conglomerate rocks along the shore. Neither 
would the coarse sandstone farther out yield rich 
soils, for sand crystals are not easily dissolved 
and the rootlets of plants cannot feed upon undis- 
solved materials. The soils resulting from the 
finer sandstone will be somewhat better. The 
mud deposits will, of course, yield fine soils; and 
since muds contain much organic material, these 
soils will be rich. 
Deep sea ooze hardens into limestone. Soils 
resulting from the decomposition of deep-water 
deposits are rich, for the ooze contains the cal- 
careous remains of marine life forms, diatoms, 
globigerina, ete., which are rich in phosphates and 
lime. The disintegration of such solidified de- 
posits produces fine rich soils. In general it may 
be said that 
(a) ‘Shallow sea-deposits yield sandy and grav- 
elly soils of low fertility. 
(b) Deep-sea deposits yield fine soils rich in or- 
ganic substances and therefore of high 
fertility. 
The application of the law of aqueous deposits 
explains the character of soils in many regions. 
The soils of the Blue Grass region of Kentucky, 
for instance, aré very rich. The teacher should 
be able to explain such an empirical statement. 
There is a chain of associations which carries one 
in thought from the fields of hemp, tobacco and

blue grass, to the Paleozoic sea that once occupied 
the Mississippi valley; to its marine life with 
microscopic limy shells; to the deep-sea ooze 
somewhat west of the old Appalachian shore; to 
the beds of limestone which the ooze helped to 
form; to the diastrophic uplift which caused the 
sea water to retreat southward; and finally to the 
rock-weathering which converted the limestone 
into rich soil. This fertile Blue Grass region 
enticed Finley and Boone through Cumberland 
Gap into a land of ‘‘wonderful fertility and 
beauty. In its rivers, its plains, its forests, its 
gentle eminences, its bright skies and salubrious 
clime, it presented then, as now, as attractive a 
residence for man.as this globe can furnish.’’* 
And all of these things are associated, in the mind 
of one who has made an intelligent study of the 
region in question. 
‘What has been said refers to local soils. There 
are, however, large regions of transported soils 
and these will need to be understood by the 
teacher. Transported soils include alluvial, gla- 
cial drift and loess soils. 
I, ALLUVIAL SOILS, 
Alluvial soils are fine and of high fertility. 
They abound in river valleys and delta forma- 
tions. The Mississippi delta affords a good illus- 
tration. The great wedge-shaped area with its 
base southward and its apex extending northward

to Illinois, constitutes the Mississippi delta. The 
delta proper is three hundred miles long and has 
an area of twelve thousand three hundred square 
miles. Its soils are composed of deep, rich allu; 
vium brought down by the Mississippi river and 
its great tributaries. Along the Mississippi, on 
either side, southward from the Ohio, terrestrial 
deposits are found, while farther back the fossils 
are marine in character. From borings exposing 
these deposits the extent of the delta has been 
determined. Much of the lower Mississippi is 
aggrading, and its overflows have deposited much 
material just outside of the banks, causing the 
land to slope gently away from the river. <A cross- 
section of the river at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, 
illustrates this well.* When floods occur suf- 
ficiently high to overflow, great sheets of shallow 
water are imprisoned back of these natural levees, 
where they contribute their loads of waste to the 
building up of alluvial plains. A large part of 
Louisiana and Arkansas, and part of Mississippi, 
are deeply covered with alluvial deposits. From 
Cairo, Illinois, the river swings back and forth in 
a‘flood plain which extends from fifteen to twenty 
miles on either side of its channels. Oxbow lakes 
are common, and terraces of alluvium and bluffs 
of loess often overlook the valley. 
II, GLACIAL DRIFT SOILS.

continents well unless he knows something of the

fundamental facts of glaciation. The topography 
and soils of northern United States have received 
their character largely through the work of gla- 
giers. .As many good books have been written on 
glaciers and glaciation interesting science sketches 
await the perusal of teacher and pupil. Not alone 
have surfaces and soils been determined by glaci- 
* ation; but commercial highways, industries and 
population have responded in turn to surface and 
soil condition. 
Long, long after the great changes that made 
our country first land, then sea, came the great 
glacier from the north, grinding the shales and 
rocks to powder, scattering and spreading the 
rock-flour smoothly over the undisturbed rocks, 
leveling the hills, and ‘‘wiping out rivers as easily 
as a schoolboy wipes out chalk marks.’’ This 
great glacier was hundreds—perhaps thousands— 
of feet in thickness, and it pushed and dragged 
the fine muds, sands, and clays, rich in lime and 
phosphorus, from the north and finally spread 
them evenly over our upper Mississippi valley, 
forming soils so productive that they have only 
“to be tickled with the plough to bring forth’a 
harvest.’? We call them glacial drift soils, and 
every schoolpoy should realize how much we owe 
the glacier for making and bringing in our soils. 
Indeed the finest fields of corn often feed on limy 
foods scraped from the Niagara limestone or Cin- 
sinnati shales of northern Illinois and southern 
Wisconsin, and laid down in the corn belt of the

country with its great fields of corn, oats and 
grass; with its orchards and gardens; and with its 
luxuriant pastures where graze white-faced Here- 
fords and dappled Percherons? This prairie 
country is level. There are no hills, just here and 
there miniature valleys and ravines, carved by 
waters of frequent storms. An occasional boulder 
lies sleeping by the roadside, but to him who is 
in tune with nature it whispers the interesting 
story of the Great Ice Age. No mountains and 
scarce a lake or waterfall break the monotony of 
its level expanse; but there is a rare beauty in the 
country road lined with elms and maples, in the 
cultivated fields of dark rich mold, and in the 
peaceful homes of plenty that dot a landscape 
whose surface and soils are products of glaciation. 
Til, LOESS SOILS, 
The loess and loam in the Mississippi valley are 
flood-plain deposits of glacial debris. The melting 
of the Great Glacier, the southern margin of 
which corresponded roughly to the courses of the 
Ohio and Mississippi rivers, furnished floods 
which carried the finer morainic materials south- 
ward into Mississippi and Louisiana. The loess 
is of great thickness, which shows that it could 
not be a disintegration of the underlying rocks. 
Its vertical extent sometimes reaches one thou- 
sand feet. It does not show stratification, a fact 
which ‘distinguishes it from the underlying rocks 
on which it lies. The absence of lime distin-
-P-A-G-E-270
  268 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
guishes it from the bluff formation along the 
Mississippi river. 
The loess is often deeper as rivers are ap- 
proached, a fact which shows that such channels 
were preéxistent. Increased thickness is observed 
near the Mississippi, the Black and the Tombigbee 
rivers. The erosion of these loess surfaces now 
assists in the transfiguration of the country. 
Loess and loam are continuous in Missis- 
sippi, though the latter is absent in the bluffs. 
They pass each other by insensible gradations.* 
The so-called loess-loam was deposited while the 
region was at sea-level and its position shows that 
no submergence has since occurred. As the great 
gulf into which the fine materials were deposited 
was not deep, the heavily loaded streams carried 
the fine sediments far outward.’ The later reces- 
sion of water permitted winds to modify the po- 
sition of the materials, hence both wind and water 
as agencies have assisted in their formations. 
The yellow loam is unstratified as a result of slug- 
gish, overloaded streams, or of consequent modifi- 
cations. No old shore lines are visible in these 
formations. The yellow loam is the latest deposit 
in northern Mississippi, extending fifty miles east 
of the Yazoo bluffs, and is described by Hilgard 
as the non-caleareous division of the loess. The 
loess proper is a fine calcareous clay, containing 
a great variety of land and fresh-water shells. 
Loess soils the world over are very rich. The 
*The geologist characterizes them as “homotaxial” and “syn- 
chronous.”

THE STUDY OF SOILS 269 
loess deposits of eastern China are of great thick- 
ness and of rare fertility. Among the regions of 
the United States covered with loess, either wind- 
blown dust deposits or water-sorted glacial mate- 
rials, are Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The 
modified drift (the siftings of glacial drift re- 
deposited from water) is found in considerable 
quantities along the Mississippi river, in parts of 
Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and elsewhere. 
Lava soils are the result of the decomposition 
of trap rock. Great fissures have been formed in 
the newer portion of our country, and from them 
much molten rock has been ejected; this volcanic 
material has flowed into the valleys and over the 
plains, sometimes for considerable distances. On 
cooling it solidified; but the resulting rock in time 
yielded to the processes of weathering and soils 
were formed from it. These soils are fertile, but 
lack of moisture often renders them unproductive. 
The study of the origin of soils is interesting 
and profitable and the methods of maintaining 
their productive capacity is of immediate impor- 
tance. Simple facts and principles, relating to 
the home neighborhood, are typical and may be 
taught in connection with geography. 
It is not difficult to classify the ‘soils and to 
associate the various types with physiographic 
regions. Their origin may then be recalled. 
The general types of soil in the following re- 
gions may prove suggestive: 
Atlantic Coastal Plains, sandy soils.  
-P-A-G-E-272
  270 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
Gulf Coastal Plains, sandy, alluvial and loess 
soils. , 
Lake Plains, lacustral* soils. 
Prairie Plains, drift soils. 
‘Northern Appalachian valleys, limestone soils. 
Columbia Plateau, lava soils. 
Basin Region, lacustral soils. 
Ete. 
There are seven elements in the soils that are 
necessary to the growth of plants. These are: 
calcium, iron, magnesium, sulphur, phosphorus, 
potassium and nitrogen. Of these, the soils con- 
tain in large amounts, all except the last three. 
Nitrogen is a gas and constitutes about four- 
fifths of the atmosphere. Teachers should make 
themselves familiar with the interesting science 
story that ‘explains how bacteria live upon the 
roots of leguminous plants and how they gather 
nitrogen from the air and store it up as nitrates 
in the nodules of rootlets. If clover be pulled up 
by the roots and carefully washed, these nodules, 
if present, can be easily seen. Agricultural col- 
leges furnish free bulletins relating to this prac- 
tical department of. science. Now that so much 
attention is given to agriculture such knowledge 
should be familiar to all elementary teachers. 
Phosphorus is of great value to soils. It is 
removed through the sale of nearly all products of . 
the farm. Much phosphorus is needed to produce 
the seeds of grains. It also goes into the bone 
structure of animals, hence any farm product ~is 
* Fine deposits of ancient lakes.
-P-A-G-E-273
  
THE STUDY OF SOILS 271 
likely to make a drain upon this important ele- 
ment of the soil. Soils deficient in phosphorus 
can be replenished through the application of rock- 
phosphate flour or bone meal. Beds of phosphate 
rock are found in Tennessee and Florida. These 
rock deposits are of high commercial value, the 
rock being quarried, ground and shipped even to 
foreign countries. 
If soils are lacking in potassium it, too, should 
be added. Crude potash mineral can be pur- 
chased on the market under the name ‘‘kainit.’’ 
Teachers would do well to secure bulletins from 
agricultural colleges, and to study selected por- 
tions of them with the children. Through the 
children the parents may become interested and, 
in this manner, the school will perform its highest 
service.

endeavor will surely bring its reward.

TOPICS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
Pronunciation of geographical names. Drill on spelling of names. 
The significance of geographical names. Illustrations. 
Definitions. Some statements should be definite and should be 
Jearned. Latitude and longitude as illustrations. 
Facts vf location and direction should receive some drill. Tlus- 
trations. Locational facts of little value; of much value. 
Statements of principles and laws should be accurate. Not many 
should be taught. 
The value of some facts has been overestimated. Examples. 
Summaries to illustrate what pupils should know. 
Relational or rational geography needs little drill. 
In order to secure satisfactory results from the 
study of any subject, definite aims must be in the 
mind of the teacher. So far as geography is con- 
cerned, no educator or group of educators has, as 
yet, clearly set forth definite standards of attain- 
ment, generally accepted by the elementary 
school. In a way, courses of study set up such 
standards, but usually they are so comprehensive 
and inclusive that, so far as pointing out the abso- 
lutely essential is concerned, they are of little 
worth. To take seriously everything found in the 
\ordinary course of study, means no emphasis of 
essentials. It is a case where ‘‘too many intensives 
fail to intensify.”’ 
274
-P-A-G-E-277
EMPHASIS IN TEACHING 275 
Still there is a general feeling among educators 
that the results of geographical teaching are not 
commensurate with the time and effort expended. 
In the light of this fact, it would seem that indefi- 
niteness of aim and method is a vulnerable point of 
attack. Geography is essentially a content study— 
a fact that complicates the problem. In the more 
formal subjects there is an element of definiteness 
that springs from their very nature. The ques- 
tion of organization and ends concerns the teacher 
of foreign language but little. In general, geog- 
raphy as a school subject is informational, explan- 
atory, significant, relational. Desired results, how- 
ever, fall into two categories: (1) acquisitions 
requiring concise expression to be valuable, and 
(2) acquisitions of connotative or significant char- 
acter, and not requiring equal exactness in expres- 
sion. All ideas of whatever kind should be clear 
and definite; but the truths in the first category 
should be clearly and concisely stated, while those 
in the second category need not be reduced to 
equal accuracy of form to be valuable. 
I. 
In the first category belong all statements of 
fact or principle that are directly useful in deter- 
mining empirical results or in reaching logical 
conclusions. Definiteness of thought and state- 
ment should attend— 
a. Pronunciation and spelling of geograph- 
ical names.
-P-A-G-E-278
    276 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
b. Definitions, as in mathematical geography. 
e. General directions and locations. 
.d. Statements of physiographic and economie 
principles, facts, and laws. 
e. Statistical units to serve as keys. 
While it is not to be inferred that large numbers 
of geographical names are to be memorized, it is 
very desirable that accuracy in spelling and pro- 
nunciation of important names be secured. Alto- 
gether too much careless work is permitted in this 
regard. Accuracy is not urged as an end in itself, 
but for its usefulness and value generally. Many 
geographical names have historical significance, 
and whatever of mastery is gained in geographical 
drill will function immediately in history, litera- 
ture, ete. 
Drill should be given on those names only that 
have become ‘‘settled’’ and are in common usage. 
Try pronouncing the names of the states of the 
Union. Look up the correct pronunciation of any 
about which you are in doubt. How many pro- 
nunciations of ‘‘Tllinois,’’ ‘‘ Arkansas,’’ and ‘‘ Mis- 
souri,’’? can be heard in our school-rooms! Is it 
not worth while to have correct pronunciation be- 
come a habit early in school life? The stirring 
song, ‘‘Not without thy wondrous story, Illinois, 
Tilinois,’’ will be more beautiful if the name is 
pronounced JIl-i-nov’ ; and the song itself may offer 
good opportunity for drill.*

Test yourself and your pupils on the pronuncia- 
tion of: 
Alabama Spokane 
Louisiana Seattle 
Colorado New Orleans 
Hawaii Sierra Nevada 
Missouri Vienna 
Asia Los Angeles 
Persia Nagasaki 
Roumania equator, etc. 
If the teacher is alert, no great amount of time 
need be taken to have a reasonable number of 
important geographical names well fixed as to 
spelling and pronunciation. Short, lively drills are 
usually enjoyed by pupils, and they should be 
given frequently. In rural schools the exercise 
may be general, as it may also in graded schools 
where two or more classes occupy one room. 
Equal attention should be given to the spelling 
of selected names. Try these: 
Delaware Gibraltar 
Philippine Alleghany 
Cincinnati ' Mediterranean 
Manila Arctic, ete. 
In this connection, also, the meaning of geo- 
graphical names should receive some attention. 
As there is really no limit of what could be accom-

plished in this direction, it is wise to select a few 
of special significance. Illustration:

Asiatic— 
Hindoostan—District of the Indus. 
Yang-tse—Son of the Sea. 
Fusiyama—Great mountain. 
Mesopotamia—Middle of the rivers. 
By constant reference to maps, some cardinal 
points may be well fixed in the mind through this 
drill. And frequently helpful associations with 
history can be effected through the significance of 
names. In the study of Washington and Oregon, 
for example, the local names are full of historical 
suggestion. Vancouver Island named for the 
English explorer; Puget Sound for Peter Puget, 
who accompanied Vancouver; Columbia River 
after Captain Gray’s ship; Astoria after. John 
Jacob Astor, who established a fur-trading sta- 
tion there; Cape Disappointment, because the 
Spanish explorer Meares was outstripped by Cap- 
tain Gray in rounding the bar to enter the Colum- 
bia River; Gray’s Harbor after Captain Gray; 
Strait of Juan de Fuca after the Greek navigator 
sailing in Spanish service under the sobriquet, 
‘« Juan de Fuca,”’ etc.* 
Definitions, to be of the highest value, must be 
very accurate and concise. However, definitions 
should not be taught dogmatically, but should be 
developed inductively. The idea or conception is 
always of first consideration. Neither are many 
definitions essential or desirable. But there are 
* See ‘‘Oregon’’—Am. Commonwealth Ser.—Barrows, p- 218.
-P-A-G-E-282
  280 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
some that are so fundamental that to learn them 
well is a matter of convenience and economy. 
Definitions of latitude and longitude are of this 
kind. A large percentage of pupils define latitude 
as the ‘‘distance north and south of the equator.’” 
Such a definition indicates inaccuracy of thought, 
and surely reflects upon someone’s teaching. Cor- 
rect the fallacy of the definition by changing and 
to or, and then strengthen it by adding the phrase, 
“‘measured on a meridian.’’? When pupils see the 
full meaning of the definition, ‘‘Latitude is dis- 
tance north or south of the equator measured on 
a meridian,’’ it is good pedagogy and surely good 
economy to have it learned once for all. Similarly, 
longitude is ‘‘distance east or west of a prime 
meridian measured on a parallel.’’ 
The examination of normal students reveals a 
poor conception of ‘‘equator.’’? The old notion of 
‘tan imaginary line around the earth’’ is preva- 
lent. This definition is both worthless and dan- 
gerous as contrasted with the terse and strong 
statement, ‘‘The equator is a great circle of the 
earth perpendicular to its axis.’? But this defini- 
tion must follow the true conception of great 
circle, together with the conception that there can 
be only one such circle perpendicular to the 
earth’s axis. 
Such old and faulty definitions as ‘‘A volcano 
is a mountain that sends forth fire, smoke, and 
lava’’ should be abandoned. A volcano is an 
opening in the earth’s crust through which inter- 
nal materials are ejected; whenever a mountain
-P-A-G-E-283
  EMPHASIS IN TEACHING asl 
is present, it is incidental to the true phenomenon, 
having been built up by the ejected materials.* 
Mt. Shasta isa good example. 
The mistake of formulating set definitions for 
the features and phenomena studied in the first 
or observational phase of geography, is often 
made. That a pupil in the third or fourth grade 
knows no set definition of a hill, is no argument 
that he does not know bill. Definitions at this 
stage of learning are very likely to be stumbling- 
blocks. How many educated adults are in posses- 
sion of set definitions of ‘‘hill,’’? ‘‘valley,’’ 
*‘river,’’ ‘‘delta,’’ ete.? For the sake of definite- 
ness it is probably not unwise to expect pupils 
in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades to know 
the generalized statements given as definitions or 
summaries, for the day only. Outside of mathe- 
matical geography, however, there are_compara- 
tively few definitions that merit memorizing. 
Not only should there be a very clear conception 
developed of the earth in space, but there should 
be drill on a limited number of locational facts. 
Drill may well be given’on imaginary journeys 
around the earth on three or four of the following 
suggested circles: 
1. The Equator. 
2. The Tropics. 
3. The Fortieth Parallel North. 
4. The Sixtieth Parallel North.

6. The Hundredth Meridian Hast. 5 
7. The Twentieth Meridian Hast. 
8. The Sixtieth Meridian West. 
‘With a few locations and directions thus well 
established, pupils will be able to approximate 
distances and locations for practical needs. To 
insist on the exact location of all countries by 
latitude and longitude would be to place emphasis 
upon the unessential and unfruitful. 
Principles, inductively developed and therefore 
understood, can well be memorized. The number 
of such principles will not be large, and their 
statement should be terse and exact. However, 
such statements are generalizations the value of 
which has already been discussed in Chapter TX, 
p. 182. Principles are quite as likely to be eco- 
nomic as physiographic. Reference to the impor- 
tance of economic principles has been made on 
pp. 89-90. Indeed, it is with them that commercial 
geography is ultimately concerned, and all repre- 
sentative texts on the subject devote consider- 
able space to the exposition of these laws and 
principles. 
Definiteness also should attend the teaching of 
statistical units which should serve as keys in the 
interpretation of text materials and in compari- 
sons. So far as notions of distant lands are con- 
cerned, they will be of necessity only approxi- 
mately correct. If our standards of interpretation 
and comparison are quite wrong to begin with, we 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
     EMPHASIS IN TEACHING 
shali be far from the truth in our final concep- 
tions.. In saying that standards should be correct, 
it is meant that they should be correct within 
reasonable limits; e. g., mountains should be 
measured in miles, certainly not more accurately 
than in even thousands of feet; areas of countries 
in round numbers of thousands, ete. Thus, Pike’s 
Peak is three miles high and Mt. Washington one 
mile high; Illinois has an area of 50,000 square 
miles, and Texas an area of 250,000 square miles; 
the distance in a straight line from Chicago to 
Boston is approximately equal to the distance 
from Chicago to Denver; from Chicago to New 
Orleans; from Chicago to Jacksonville, Florida. 
The population of Cincinnati is approximately 
equal to that of Milwaukee; of Antwerp, Belgium; 
and of Alexandria, Egypt. ‘ 
In like manner, statistics of production should 
be reasonably accurate. A limited number only 
should be learned to serve as standards of com- 
parison, but these should be learned thoroughly. 
(Reference to the use of statistics has been made 
on p. 248.) The somewhat questionable results 
now attained in geography are the result of the 
educational sentiment that has underestimated 
the knowledge of facts. Some facts, some laws, 
must be learned in the study of geography, or the 
whole intellectual structure will be without sub- 
stantial framework. So the completion of the 
course should presuppose the knowledge of a 
timited number of generalized facts of current. 
mterest and general usefulness. It matters little   
-P-A-G-E-286
  284 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
to just what these facts relate, so long as the above 
requisites be satisfied. For example, sugar is a 
staple food product and figures in every tariff 
schedule of the United States. A well-trained 
grammar school pupil should have some idea of 
the rank of the United States as a sugar pro- 
ducing country, if later as a citizen he shall be 
entitled to an opinion on the justice of a tariff on 
this commedity. Hence the pupil should have 
learned something of the leading sugar producing 
regions of the world and should know how his, 
own country compares with them in its produc- 
tion. In like manner, rather definite notions 
should be gained relative to the production of 
iron, coal, copper, gold, corn, wheat, cotton, to- 
bacco, live stock, ete. 
In a negative way it may be well to point out 
some phases that have, in the past, been over- 
emphasized. There is little value, in the long run, 
in ‘‘bounding’’ countries, and as soon as the 
regional unit is generally recognized, there will be 
less occasion for spending energy in this direction. 
So, too, the description of rivers is not very fruit- 
ful. Knowledge of this sort should be learned 
incidentally through the sketching of maps and 
in that study of maps in which mere form is not 
the object of attainment. 
Too much’ effort should not be given to the 
learning and locating of cities. A limited number 
of commercial, manufacturing, and historical 
places should be carefully located and thoroughly 
fixed in mind. Liverpool, San Francisco, Rio
-P-A-G-E-287
  
EMPHASIS IN TEACHING 285 
Janeiro, and New Orleans; Cleveland, Grand 
Rapids, Lyons, Manchester, and Birmingham; 
Manila, Bennington, Waterloo, Gettysburg, Luck- 
now, and Richmond are examples of cities that 
for obvious reasons should be well fixed and 
properly associated in the mind. 
In general, also, there is little reason for learn- 
ing capes, bays, straits, etc., for any intrinsic value 
that these names possess. 
But whenever such features function as 
economic or strategic points, they should be 
learned. Gibraltar, because it controls the en- 
trance to the Mediterranean; Hong-Kong, because 
it is an important British coaling and trading 
station; the Hawaiian Islands, because of their 
location in the midst of the Pacific Ocean, and 
their consequent economic and strategic value to 
the United States; and the Suez Canal, because 
of its commercial importance, all illustrate true 
locational values in geography, and so point to 
facts that should be emphasized and well known 
by pupils on their completion of the elementary 
school. 
In a larger way, also, pupils should be able to 
image the continents in their relative positions on 
the globe, and should be able to make rapid free- 
hand sketches of them, showing the major features 
of their outlines. They should have clear mental . 
pictures of the salient relief features and appre- 
ciate their influence upon climate, upon distribu- 
tion of population, commerce, ete. For example, 
pupils, at the completion of the elementary school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  286 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
should be able to sketch South America from 
memory; to show the Orinoco, Amazon, and La 
Plata rivers; to show the location or trend of 
the Guiana and Brazilian Highlands and the 
Andes Mountains; to locate a half dozen impor- 
tant cities—e. g., Rio Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Val- 
paraiso, ete.; to be able to explain the effects of 
the mountain ranges on climate and rainfall, 
e. g., the causes for heavy precipitation in western 
Brazil and for the aridity of northern Chile; to 
associate with the larger regions of the country 
their sources of wealth, industries, ete. It is not 
desirable or reasonable to expect pupils to be able 
to indicate the exact boundaries of political divi- 
sions, or even locate their capitals, though the 
gross outlines of the countries should be acquired. 
That Chile, e. g., is a long, narrow country west 
of the Andes and bordering the Pacifie Ocean; 
that the precipitation is heavy in the south and 
very light in the north; that its leading exports are 
wool, hides, wheat, sodium-nitrate, and guano; 
that its trade is chiefly with Great Britain and 
Germany ; and that Valparaiso is its leading port; 
these facts, if understood, would indicate good 
results from the teaching of this particular coun- 
try. Taking South America as a whole, a resume 
like the following, taken from Dodge’s Advanced 
Geography, would seem adequate, if the indi- 
vidual statements can be explained and made - 
meaningful by the pupils: 
‘<South America is, on the whole, unprogressive, 
except in the countries of the temperate belt and 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  EMPHASIS IN TEACHING 287 
in Brazil. The governments are unstable, revo- 
lutions are frequent, and business cannot there- 
fore be carried on successfully. The continent is 
deficient in railroads and highways, and hence the 
native riches are not developed. The exports. are 
mostly mineral and cattle products, except in the 
few scattered agricultural regions. The imports 
are chiefly foodstuffs and manufactured goods, 
especially textiles and steel. It is anticipated that 
when the Panama Canal is completed, so that 
commerce can be readily carried on between the 
western coast and the large commercial centers 
of the United States, the continent will develop 
rapidly.’’ 
II. 
Ultimately, the richest phase of geography is 
that which is explanatory and significant, i. e., the 
rational.* It is this phase which leads to an appre- 
ciation of physical environment. No instruction 
in geography that stops short of this acquirement 
can be considered fruitful. Often large numbers of 
formal facts are learned by pupils, but no genuine 
appreciation awakened; no permanent interest 
aroused; no oneness with Natute ever felt. Geog- 
raphy, broadly considered, is humanitarian. The 
real test of its worth lies in the inclination 
and power to interpret. A ramble through the 
meadows, a walk by the brook, a quiet hour by »

-P-A-G-E-290
  288 THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
the lake-shore or sea-side, is delightful—yes, fasci- 
nating to him whose eyes are fully open and ‘‘to 
him who in the love of Nature holds communion 
with her visible forms.’’ 
Pupils in the grammar grades can catch some- 
thing of this deeper meaning, if rightly taught. 
And the most fruitful method is that which brings 
pupils and earth phenomena into direct contact. 
Often, very often, cold formal statements are the 
only agencies employed by teachers, and the 
results obtained are fragmentary and unvital- 
ized. But excursion, experiment, and museum 
are agencies through which a genuine awaken- 
ing can be effected. It would be very difficult 
to designate the exact number or kind of 
“earth friendships’? that any class of pupils 
should make. Indeed, it matters little just what 
they are, if only a reasonable number are estab- 
lished. The kind should be determined very largely 
by the immediate environment of the particular 
pupils in question. Since all of the relationships 
of geography point to a relatively small number 
of laws for their explanation, it is often imma- 
terial what relationships are considered, so long 
as the basal conception is gained. Thus, for ex- 
ample, the slow uplift of the continental margin in 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, has caused 
a retreat of the sea-water and a consequent shal- 
lowing of the embayments, which otherwise might 
have afforded good natural harbors. Occasionally 
a downward oscillation in some locality, as at 
Mobile, Alabama, has preserved an advantageous 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
EMPHASIS IN TEACHING 289 
harbor; but this phenomenon on the coasts of 
Maine and Norway has drowned the river-mouths 
and converted the continental margins into typical 
fiorded coasts. The same physiographic process 
lifted the Colorado Plateau and, by increasing the 
difference between land and sea levels, established 
conditions which favored rapid vertical corrasion 
by streams, resulting in the formation of cafions 
so gigantic and wonderful that the mind of man 
views with amazement the stupendous work of 
Nature. 
Conceptions of this kind need never be memo- 
rized, need not be drilled upon or reduced to 
particular form. They are great truths, and, once 
fully conceived, become nuclei of important apper- 
ceptive systems. 
There is no danger that too much thinking, inter- 
preting, explaining, and relating will be at- 
tempted by pupils in geography. It is in work of 
this kind that growth and development occur. 
Grammar school geography should lend itself 
largely to this explanatory and rational phase. 
Do not raise the objection that such conceptions 
are too difficult—that pupils cannot think! The 
essence of all good teaching is found in the ability 
to make pupils think. Geography contains rela- 
tively little of form-value, relatively much of 
thought-value. But the ideas and conceptions are 
so pertinent, so significant, and so individually 
serviceable and explanatory, that they establish a. 
pre-eminence among intellectual acquisitions.

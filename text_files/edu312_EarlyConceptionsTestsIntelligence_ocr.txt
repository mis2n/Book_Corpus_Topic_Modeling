Fable, parable, and proverb abound in 
allusions to tests of one kind and another. 
The wheat is separated from the chaff; the 
sheep are divided from the goats; the strong 
are set apart from the weak; and the wise 
are welcomed to the feast, while the foolish 
and improvident are allowed to remain in the 
outer darkness with their unfilled lamps. It 
is a far cry from the tests referred to in 
ancient lore to the scientific tests which, 
within the last decade, have found a perma- 
nent place in the schools of our country. 
But the fact remains that testing is not new, 
and that tests of intelligence are old and 
tried devices. For an adequate under- 
standing of modern tests and their purpose, 
some knowledge of their evolution is neces- 
sary; and to make accessible to students a 
history of the conceptions of intelligence that 
have led to the development of the tests of 
today, World Book Company offers the

PREFACE 
THERE is at present a great popular as well as scientific 
interest in the subject of intelligence testing, and a consider- 
able amount of money is being spent each year in the public 
schools and colleges to determine in advance of their training, 
by means of tests, the abilities of students who enter these 
institutions. The information thus obtained is regarded as 
useful not only in the educational guidance and training of 
the children and youths toward their individual careers, but 
also in their classification into different sections where they 
can be taught with groups of children of approximately their 
own degrees of intelligence. 
The old question of repeating grades has received light 
from a new angle, and there are at present many well- 
informed individuals who contend that it is useless to ask a 
dull child to repeat a grade and a kind of work which have 
already been found to be above his limited comprehension. 
They hold that each child should be tested very early in his 
school career and should be given work of a character that 
will interest him and will come within the range of his abili- 
ties, so that he may make constant advance from year to year 
and be spared the humiliation and discouragement involved in 
the repetition of grades, and at the same time they are will- 
ing to give him the benefit of every bit of evidence that he 
can show in his work at any time for ability to do the normal 
child’s work. They point out that there is no evidence of 
any very marked benefits derived from the repetition of a 
grade because of original failure. 
Aside from the numerous uses now made of tests in the 
schools, important steps are being taken, by their use, to- 
ward better adjustment in the various fields of social and 
industrial activities, and the more progressive courts and 
penal institutions are adopting tests of intelligence to throw

light on many problems relating to responsibility for crime. 
The testing by psychologists of one and _ three-quarters 
million soldiers in the recent war brought forcibly to the 
attention of the American public the fact that psychology 
may be of service in the solution of problems in the practical 
world. There has even been danger of late that — except 
for the case of psychoanalysis ! — intelligence testing would 
be regarded by the popular mind as the whole substance of 
psychology. 
Even on the science of psychology itself the effects of the 
testing movement, particularly that more successful one 
headed by Alfred Binet and occupying most of his attention 
from early in the nineties, have been considerable. There 
has been a noticeable shift of emphasis away from the more 
simple reaction and sensory discrimination activities, and the 
attention of psychologists has for some years now been a 
good deal occupied with such problems as the interrelations 
of different measurable traits, and the nature of “general 
intelligence” and methods of its quantitative measurement. 
Many of the old-line experiments in psychology are growing 
obsolete and we are becoming more and more interested in 
what one can do under different conditions and in different 
fields of activity, rather than, as formerly, in what one finds 
on introspecting one’s “consciousness” under given experi- 
mental conditions. Indeed, the old distinction between a 
“psychological experiment” and a “test”’ has been challenged, 
and it has been urged that tests are not only devices used for 
practical purposes in rating individuals and their several 
capacities, but also useful instruments of scientific research. 
(See reference 208.) 
Questions as to the nature of intelligence, including its 
relations to the traditional intellectual functions and to 
emotions and instincts, are of great importance, and they 
need to be investigated thoroughly. It is obvious that 
 
-P-A-G-E-5

individual differences in various mental traits, as distinct 
from intelligence in general, are so great as to leave serious 
doubts regarding the wisdom of adopting any single measure 
of one’s mental capacity except for the most practical and 
immediate purposes; and yet it is far from clear which traits 
are most predictive of one’s general success in the ordinary 
activities of life. Is there a general intelligence factor which 
may be measured with different degrees of completeness in 
the several kinds of performances, or is intelligence but a 
balancing of many overlapping individual processes and 
traits? How far can we profitably and safely go in the 
selection of persons for different careers according to their 
several traits, in view of the great plasticity of any normal 
human being? These are problems that still await solution, 
even though considerable progress has now been made, particu- 
larly as to scientific methods of studying them; and they re- 
late to scientific research in psychology just as directly as they 
do to the more immediately practical problems in education. 
Intelligence is vastly more complex than is usually ‘sup- 
posed, and the problems as to its nature and the practi- 
cal methods of its quantitative determination in different 
individuals touch vitally most of the older economic, reli- 
gious, educational, penal, and even philosophical problems 
which have occupied great minds since the dawn of history. 
Many of the older problems as they were once stated are be- 
ing solved by neglect; they are taking on new aspects com- 
patible with scientific treatment. It has therefore seemed 
to me a matter of such importance, to the advancement 
both of the science of psychology and of the work of practi- 
cal education, to have a rather direct, simple statement of 
the development of conceptions and tests of intelligence, 
that I have determined to undertake a presentation of this 
bit of interesting and useful history. The following chapters 
are the concrete results of this undertaking.
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi Preface @ 
Some of the most difficult problems throughout this work 
have been what to omit. It was felt that of the omitted data 
some indications should be left by way of direct and indirect 
references, so that the interested reader could find his way 
intelligently beyond the limits here set for ourselves. On 
the other hand, it would be a mistake to burden a work of 
this kind— which aims fundamentally to interest the 
reader intelligently in a most important and inviting field 
and to stimulate him to build up a scientific attitude toward 
human conduct — with the numerous details of the studies 
reviewed. 
For three reasons the present historical sketch of the con- 
ceptions and tests of intelligence has been limited to the 
period ending with the death of Binet. First, the develop- 
ment of tests since that time is reasonably well known by 
educators and by other members of the intelligent public, 
and is well covered by a number of books now enjoying 
a wide circulation. Second, an attempt to cover recent 
developments in a full and critical manner would require an 
amount of time not available at present, and it would involve 
the treatment of matters that are too technical for the present 
purpose. Recent developments are treated in various sepa- 
rate volumes by different authors, and many of them are 
yet so new and in so unsettled a state as to make a general 
evaluation dangerous and inadvisable. In the third place 
the early testing activities center so much around the life of 
the great French psychologist, who gave practically his entire 
life to researches along this line, that it seemed peculiarly 
fitting to stop with the end of his own contributions. 
Abstract statements about various views and tests are of 
little interest or value to any but those already acquainted 
with the developments of the testing work; so I have 
chosen to present the contributions of each investigator from 
his own point of view and, as far as practicable, in his own
-P-A-G-E-7

words. The various tests have in most cases been briefly 
described, even at the risk of a little monotony to some 
readers, because they give point to the discussions and fur- 
nish suggestions for present-day experimenters who per- 
chance do not know the tests that have formerly been used. 
Many of the tests that have been suggested or used doubtless 
have value for experimental work in college courses and for 
researches, which was not brought out by their authors — 
and, indeed, was not known to them. By different weight- 
ings and combinations several tests and measuring devices 
now discarded may prove to have considerable value. At 
any rate, to read an authority’s own words and to go over 
with him his list of tests will give one a feeling of intimate 
acquaintance and a personal interest that indirect and gen- 
eral statements cannot yield. Readers who have the time 
should go to the several sources cited, and work out for them- 
selves various details, both in point of view and in method of 
procedure in the tests. 
It is hoped that this book will serve usefully as a textbook 
in college courses in the history of the testing movement, and 
also as a guide in certain parts of courses in present-day 
mental tests, in the history of psychology, and in advanced 
psychology. To this end exercises and suggestions for 
further work have been inserted at the conclusion of the 
several chapters. But the general reader should also find 
the book helpful in gaining a perspective in a subject of wide 
general interest and importance. 
It may seem to some readers that I have given relatively 
too much attention to Binet’s experiments and tests, and 
that others have been omitted which should have been in- 
cluded. To such criticisms I can say only that Binet’s tests 
were in practically all cases concerned with the problem of 
measuring the general mental ability, or intelligence, of the 
subject, whereas this interest in intelligence was not present

in many of the tests and experiments carried out on special 
functions by other investigators. In general, experiments 
out of which mental tests have grown have been included in 
our account, as well as those which have been especially 
devised to measure intelligence. No claim is made either to 
completeness or to entire freedom from errors, and con- 
structive criticisms from readers will be gratefully received. 
Great pains have, however, been taken to avoid errors and 
to represent fairly, both in quotations and in summary state- 
ments, the views of the various authorities considered. 
I wish to express here my thanks to Miss Euri Belle Bolton 
and Mr. Lyle H. Lanier, graduate students in psychology in 
George Peabody College for Teachers, for reading the entire 
manuscript and for making valuable suggestions. My son, 
Joseph Kimbark Peterson, has helped me both in the gather- 
ing of data and in the making and verifying of translations 
in the quotations from foreign languages. I am indebted to 
Professor Lewis M. Terman, editor of the Measurement and 
Adjustment? Series, for many helpful criticisms and sug- 
gestions. My greatest indebtedness, though it is in this case 
indirect, is to President James R. Angell, under whose master- 
ful direction I was once privileged to work as a student in 
psychology. He may find these fruits of his labors somewhat 
distorted in the chapters that follow!

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tur number of intelligence tests has increased so rapidly 
in recent years and the attention of workers has been so en- 
grossed with the compelling problems arising from their 
practical application, that students of the subject are likely 
to lose sight of the psychological assumptions upon which 
the mental test is based and of the historical developments 
which gave rise to it. Thus far no really satisfactory text- 
book on the history, principles, technique, and results of 
mental measurement has been published, and the few texts 
that are available are in nothing more unsatisfactory than in 
their neglect of historical orientation. This would not be so 
serious if it were possible to make good the omission by re- 
quired reading among convenient and suitable references. At 
present this is not possible, because a majority of the refer- 
ences which would be most useful for this purpose are in tech- 
nical French and German periodicals. The result is that we 
are encouraging the use of psychological methods by teachers 
and others whose knowledge of the tools they employ is en- 
tirely inadequate. 
A few years ago many believed that the only solution of 
the problem was to restrict the use of intelligence tests to 
thoroughly trained psychologists. Ten years ago the editor 
of the Measurement and Adjustment Series was almost alone 
in opposing this view. Time has emphatically vindicated 
his position. Experience has shown that teachers can be 
taught to use profitably not only the simpler forms of group 
tests, but even the Binet-Simon procedure. Instruction in 
the use of intelligence tests is now coming to be recognized 
as an essential part of the training of students in normal 
schools and teachers’ colleges throughout the country. It 
only remains to make such instruction more thoroughgoing 
and substantial. Courses in mental measurement should be 
xiii
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv Editor’s Introduction 
lengthened and more time should be devoted to underlying 
principles and to historical orientation. 
There is no better way to introduce the student to the 
issues involved in the use of intelligence tests than to ac- 
quaint him with the experiments and the conceptions which 
led to their development. It is to serve this purpose that 
Professor Peterson’s book has been written. The author’s 
thorough familiarity with the pertinent historical facts, his 
clarity of exposition, and his freedom from bias in the treat-_ 
ment of unsettled questions have given us a book which is 
certain to prove extremely useful as a text in normal schools, 
colleges, and universities. It will also meet an important 
need among teachers in service whose formal training has 
not included courses in mental measurement and who want 
more than a superficial knowledge about the methods of test- 
ing and rating which they are expected to employ.

  EARLY CONCEPTIONS AND 
TESTS OF INTELLIGENCE 
CHAPTER ONE 
ANCIENT AND PopuLAR ConcEPTIONS oF INTELLIGENCE 
THE BASIS OF CONCEPTIONS OF MYSTERIOUS FORCES 
From the very earliest times man has recognized a conflict 
between his own desires and purposes, on the one hand, and 
the forces or conditions outside himself on the other. Things 
do not just happen in a sort of passive way as if all events 
were but incidents in a flowing stream of experiences deter- 
mined once for all. In general we may say that regular 
processes gave little trouble. Events that are regular and 
predictable from known circumstances are expected and can 
be allowed for; so they draw less attention than do happen- 
ings that seem to come somehow on their own account, arbi- 
trarily. It is of course true that primitive thinkers attempted 
to account — and often accounted in extremely crude fashion 
—for the presence of certain regularly occurring natural 
objects like heavenly bodies; but the things to challenge the 
attention of every person were the more or less non-predict- 
able, irregular, and infrequent happenings, such as storms, 
lightning, thunder, eclipses, diseases, deaths of fellows, inva- 
sions by enemies, whether man or fierce beasts, etc. These 
phenomena often interfered seriously with personal ends and 
desires, resulting in conflicts, deprivations, and struggles 
which were explicable only on the assumption that both 
within man and beast and in nature outside are arbitrary 
forces of some sort. 
The existence of these forces, however, was not rationally 
inferred, any more than we rationally infer consciousness — 
pains, pleasures, desires, etc. —in our fellows, from their 
behavior; the forces were directly ascribed to phenomena 
1
-P-A-G-E-16
ee 
« ‘ 
2 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
of the kinds mentioned, immediately on the perception of 
those phenomena, just as we immediately locate sounds 
to the right or to the left of us without any rational study, 
and without awareness of the intensity and phase differences 
of the stimuli in the two ears. As we just hear things located 
here and there, so primitive men simply perceived directly 
in various irregular and threatening phenomena about them 
certain arbitrary forces with consciousness, knowledge, de- 
sires, and purposes, interpreting these processes from their 
own directly experienced desires, hopes, disappointments, 
memories, etc. There were thus supposedly arbitrary forces 
both within and without, but naturally the attention’ would 
first be directed to outward things that tended either to 
frustrate their own purposes or to give aid against threaten- 
ing conditions, and so the “inner life” would be neglected, 
or be undifferentiated from outer events. 
Primitive men were not very adept at analyzing the pro- 
cesses of nature and at tracing each to its conditions.. Fre- 
quently the calamities and great benefactions and successes 
would be ascribed to something that caught their attention 
in association with critical experiences, even though there was 
no necessary connection between the two events. Thus 
success in an encounter with enemies or in hunting would be 
attributed to the more striking external objects, or to acts 
which happened to be performed in connection with such 
objects, whether or not there was any real relation between 
the two (102). Any observant person will readily note that 
even today many individuals make similar errors in their 
attempts to trace the real cause of calamities and failures, or 
of successes and good fortune. As a result of these misin- 
terpretations primitive men developed various means of 
supposed control over events; they attempted to bring about 
\conditions which they thought were necessarily linked up 
somehow with the desired results. We can here only mention 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
_ Ancient and Popular Conceptions 3 
the ceremonies, taboos, etc., that resulted, but, for a con- 
sideration of them, must refer the reader to special treatments 
in other works (162, 239). 
The conception of various mysterious and arbitrary forces 
in nature thus naturally arose from an inadequate analysis 
of causal connections; and it is not surprising that this 
should be true, for the causal relations of certain events are so 
deeply hidden and so remote that generations of work have 
been required to sift them out. Thus primitive man might 
see a storm uproot trees and bring pain and destruction to 
certain individuals while others were spared. He did not 
have an adequate conception of air, of expansion by heat, of 
greater weight per volume of cold than of warm air, of dis- 
placement of the latter by the former, etc., as we have today, 
thanks to our social inheritances enriched by the researches 
of thousands of individuals who have had more or less leisure 
for such studies. How natural, then, for primitive man to 
ascribe such apparently disconnected events to some arbi- 
trary principle, such as the wrathful will of a mighty enemy. 
If nature always acted by immediate and obvious contact of one 
event with another, such as we see when the club in a boy’s 
hand hits the ball and sends it flying through the air, the 
idea of such arbitrary forces would probably never have 
developed. But whenever causal relations acted indirectly 
or apparently irregularly, there some special power or some 
supernatural agency must be at work; no other account 
could be given. 
LIFE PHENOMENA HARD TO TRACE CAUSALLY 
It is chiefly in the life phenomena that these latter condi- 
tions obtained. Animals take food and expend the energy 
in acts which are not directly and completely aroused by 
external conditions. Inner metabolic processes are at work 
producing hunger impulses, sex impulses, and other kinds of 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  4 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
“drives,” as we now call such tendencies ; and certain threat- 
ening situations, as Cannon has so well shown (85), stimulate 
internal secretions and bodily disturbances that greatly affect 
behavior. Thus in fear or anger the individual may seem to 
be beside himself, and in these states both animals and men 
often depart radically from their usual modes of behavior. 
All these hidden inner processes were to primitive men, as 
they still are to most persons, missing links in the chain of 
events, and so their results were variously interpreted. 
Diseases and death, which rather abruptly tore up personal 
relationships without any obvious and causal connections, 
were fearful violations of the regularity of nature and of the 
natural sequence of events; consequently they were objects 
of superstitious fear and dread, to be controlled, if at all, 
only by incantations, charms, ceremonies, and other acts that 
may by chance have been performed simultaneously with re- 
coveries from disease and rescues from destruction. We need 
go back but a few decades — to periods prior to the discovery 
of disease germs by Pasteur — to witness civilized man using 
similar methods in the supposed control of diseases. In- 
deed, these primitive means are even today employed by the 
majority of mankind when sorely besieged; they are yet 
almost the rule among persons to whom the connections 
traced by science are yet unknown or unappreciated. Every 
newspaper carries “evidences” of the successful combating 
of diseases by appeals to mysterious forces, by the use of 
“quack medicines,” and so on. « 
HUMAN BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY COMPLEX AS TO CAUSAL 
RELATIONS 
In human behavior the causal connections in the chaino 
events are probably of all kinds the most difficult to follow 
and to understand. In the first place, the germ cell from 
which the individual develops is an organization of substances
-P-A-G-E-19
  Ancient and Popular Conceptions 5 
which is determined in its nature by conditions very remote 
in the ancestral history (142); and it is yet not well under- 
stood, even by geneticists, how the organization was effected 
and how it is modified by. environment. Within the germ 
cell itself, and within the rowing individual resulting from 
it, are numerous interacting part-processes whose activi- 
ties are only indirectly influenced by environmental condi- 
tions. There is thus even in the cell a strong tendency to 
self-determination; for example, sex, the general structure 
and characteristics of the race, complexion, degree of curli- 
ness of hair, degree of tendency to corpulence, to baldness, 
to emotional excitement, to occupation with remote condi- 
tions and abstract relationships (intelligence), and numerous 
other tendencies and characteristics are probably determined 
in the main by internal organization in the cell itself and are 
strongly resistant to present and immediate environmental 
conditions, even though general nutrition is obviously de- 
pendent upon environmental conditions. In other words, 
because of this inner organization and this consequent inter- 
action, always in operation, of part-processes upon one 
another, the germ cell shows a strong tendency within itself to 
take, even against opposition, certain directions of growth 
and also of behavior — directions which in many respects 
are not understood by the unscientific and the untrained 
person, and which are therefore attributed to arbitrary forces 
of some kind within the resulting individual himself. In- 
stinct, predisposition, interest, and intelligence are names used 
by all of us to designate such tendencies; voluntary atten- 
tion, will, and reason designate certain expressions of these 
tgpdencies, as modified by past environmental conditions in 
the individual life of the person. 
To the uncritical observer these various tendencies in the 
individual wrongly take on in higher forms of behavior the 
appearance of arbitrary forces, independent of antecedent
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
conditions. It is only on a very careful study by psycholo- 
gists of the effects in behavior of heredity, of the training of 
the individual, and of the relations of ideas, that behavior 
of this kind is found to follow laws of causation in an orderly 
manner, and to be predictable and controllable to an increas- 
ing extent, roughly speaking, with increasing knowledge of 
antecedent conditions. It is only on the possibility of such 
predictability and control that the science of psychology 
rests; and since the controlling factors of the conduct of a 
person are thus very largely remote, complex, and concealed, 
it is but natural that the science of psychology should have! 
been relatively late in its development.) Indications are 
that the immediate future will bring great developments in 
this field, for even scientists are but now breaking away from 
assumptions of arbitrary faculties in the explanations and 
analyses of human behavior. . 
CONSCIOUS PHENOMENA AND VOLUNTARY ACTION PUZZLING 
Another confusing thing about our own behavior is that 
it is conscious, and even self-conscious. As a consequence 
of this the conflicts of the remote backing that we have in- 
dicated are immediately felt and interpreted, rather naturally, 
as arbitrary faculties overruling present obstructions and 
stimuli. We feel that we will this or that act or thought 
independently of present or even past conditions. We thus 
recognize even within ourselves seemingly arbitrary forces 
struggling with external powers in nature and with the wills 
and artifices of living enemies, both animal and human. 
How natural, then,(that man should get into. the habit of 
assuming the existence of self-directing forces, unconditioned 
by antecedent processes. 2 Does he not see all around him 
such forces? Men are making nature over to their own 
purposes; they are cutting down trees and making out of 
them houses, furniture, books, etc.; they are developing
-P-A-G-E-21
  Ancient and Popular Conceptions 7 
agriculture, changing the form of plants and even of animals 
under domestication for their own ends and needs; forming 
unions and making laws to compel others to conform to their 
own purposes and principles. Is this not sufficient evidence 
that intelligence is a force or a power that overrules circum- 
stances for its own ends? So must reason every one who 
does not take a large view of conduct and note the interaction 
within the organism of part-processes of very remote origin. 
Careful scientists are attempting as far as possible to avoid 
the use of terms like “forces,” “powers,” “faculties,” etc., 
in the sense of arbitrary, non-predictable or non-conditioned 
factors in the universe, because they find strong evidence to 
support the growing conviction that every such manifesta- 
tion is somehow conditioned by antecedent events, if only 
we could ferret out their connections and accurately trace 
their lines of operation. It is, however, often awkward to 
express ourselves clearly regarding human conduct if we 
adhere strictly to this position. We are forced to make 
roundabout and even seemingly evasive statements to our 
inquiring fellows not so well trained; and frequently we 
must appear at a disadvantage to those who disregard 
scientific causality and who simply say that a man wills to do 
thus and so; that if he has robbed a bank he has put his will 
against the good of his fellows and is wholly responsible for 
his deliberately planned acts. Indeed he is responsible. 
No one would properly refuse to “hold him responsible,” 
but the wise man would mean by this, doing something to 
him that would effect a change in his conduct for the better, 
or that would at least safeguard others from his ill-doing 
and his bad example; not that he should be punished retrib- 
utively, merely to fulfill upon him one’s grudge. 
There is thus superficially much justification for the popu- 
lar conceptions of mind and intelligence still current. At 
least from a short-sighted, ultra-practical standpoint the
-P-A-G-E-22
8 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
popular usage is the more direct and simple. “What, do 
you deny the freedom of the will?’’ is the expression one often 
hears from the ordinary person who first squarely confronts 
the scientific, more remotely orientated view; and such a 
person then proceeds to point out the evidences of freedom 
and of forces within us, already briefly indicated. 
THE POPULAR VIEW OF ARBITRARY MENTAL FORCES 
IS INADEQUATE 
Yet this popular view which seems so practical and simple, 
which has so thoroughly worked itself into our conceptions 
of morality and into our religious views as to become the 
orthodox view, securing the approval of many social better- 
ment agencies, is at bottom both inhuman and unjust. 
Strange to say, it is only in the abstract that it is held even 
by the popular mind. With respect to their own relatives 
and intimate friends people do not accept it, and they always 
explain in a more thoroughly scientific manner the shortcom- 
ings and serious breaches in conduct of at least these individ- 
uals so well understood by them. They know that this or 
that friend or relative did not have an evil will or purpose, 
or at least that if he did for the time have one it was the result 
of such and such conditions, which they point out. 
Since, then, the structure of nature, so to speak, is not 
homogeneous, since organizations exist within organizations 
so as greatly to conceal the sequence of events in certain 
compartments of our world of experience, we find men differ- 
ing greatly in their interpretations and explanations of many 
everyday events, this being particularly true of the phenom- 
ena of human behavior ;! and views of intelligence and will, 
1The deceptive behavior of the well-known horses of Elberfeld, which 
made them appear to learn mathematical and other complex processes more 
readily than man learns them, was taken by Maeterlinck as genuine, and 
was ascribed in his Unknown Guest (160) to the “Unconscious.” Scientists 
found after prolonged investigation that the horses had only been influenced 
by head movements of the trainer.

representing practically all stages of historical development, 
are found in the popular notions of today. There are at 
least two reasons for this: one is that views held by ancient 
thinkers become foundations of beliefs and of popular inter- 
pretations of life and have consequently become so thoroughly 
a part of institutions, customs, and literature as to be prac- 
tically ineradicable by time; another reason is that the or- 
dinary, untrained individual is still uncritical and credulous, 
largely as were our early ancestors. He has not had the 
training and the leisure — and in most cases also lacks the 
ability — for critical analysis of his experiences. So there 
is usually a popular as well as a scientific way of accounting 
for phenomena the explanation of which is not evident, phe- 
nomena which are not obviously the outcome of antecedent 
conditions.! 
A SAMPLING OF THE VIEWS OF INTELLIGENCE HELD 
BY COLLEGE STUDENTS 
The college student represents a view that is considerably 
in advance of the popular view; he is better trained than 
the average person and better endowed, having survived the 
elimination process in the grades and in the high school. 
Nevertheless, even the college student usually entertains 
views of mind and intelligence that are contrary to scientific 
principles of sequence or causality. Recently the following 
questions were presented to students who were beginning 
their work in certain courses in psychology: 1. What is 
intelligence? 2. Is it a force (or power) or a mechanism? 
8. Is it material or immaterial (an immaterial entity) ? 
4, Is it a general ability or a limited function, applying par-

tific view of the healing of diseases as applied, not in general, but to particular 
cases; of the appearance of great geniuses and deliverers among certain 
peoples in critical periods of their history; of the interpretation of dreams 
and of certain abnormal experiences of neurotics; etc.

  10) Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ticularly to special mental operations? 5. Is it simple and 
homogeneous or complex and heterogeneous? 6. What is 
its field of operation ? 
Of seventy-five students beginning work in psychology, 
who answered the questions, 84 per cent regarded intelli- 
gence as a force or a power, while only 40 per cent regarded 
it as a mechanism (some students voted for both) and 44 
per cent replied that it is immaterial or an immaterial entity. 
Intelligence was thought to be a limited faculty or function 
by 61 per cent and a general ability by only 36 per cent. 
Seventy-six per cent replied that it is complex and hetero- 
geneous, while 11 per cent thought that it is simple and homo- 
geneous. In the individual statements regarding the field 
of operation most replies showed clearly the effect of the 
intellectualists’ view, and held that intelligence is a higher 
cognitive power having to do with ideas, reasoning, and 
comprehending, though a considerable number of the views 
expressed were inclined to stress ability to adapt oneself to 
environment. 
The same questions presented to thirteen students in an 
advanced course evoked answers that clearly showed the 
influence of psychological teaching, 77 per cent of them hold- 
ing that intelligence is a mechanism, while only 54 per cent 
held it to be a power or a force, and these latter were all stu- 
dents in the course who were not doing major work in psychol- 
ogy. None of these students had previously been specifi- 
cally indoctrinated or instructed on these points. While 
these data are not presented in any sense of finality, and it is 
recognized that in many cases the questions are ambiguous 
and not mutually exclusive, it is probably safe to say that 
the more training one gets in the study of psychology, the 
more is one inclined to see natural sequences in mental 
activities and behavior. A thorough knowledge of mental 
operations tends to give one a naturalistic view of behavior, 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  Ancient and Popular Conceptions 11 
one that rules out all arbitrary and (theoretically, at least) 
non-predictable factors. 
That the term “intelligence” at the present time has no 
definite and common meaning to all persons, should occasion 
no surprise to one-who has even a superficial knowledge of 
the historical development of the conceptions now associated 
with the term. Even among psychologists different views 
are entertained as to the nature of intelligence, but in this 
case the differences, with rare exceptions, relate only to the 
minor aspects of. the general conception, not to ee 
different conceptions. 
EARLY GREEK VIEWS OF “NOUS” 
The Greeks were the first to develop scientific conceptions 
of intelligence and of mental operations. We find the be- 
ginnings of their concepts in the idea of nous as held by 
Anaxagoras (cir. 500-428 B.c.), who first used the term in 
a technical sense. Nous to him was a distinct principle of 
spontaneous power acting according to ends, “thus giving 
movement, unity, and system to what had previously been 
a jumble of inert elements” (232, pages 42 ff.). It was, 
however, not an immaterial something but was composed 
of a more attenuated, finer material than the usual inert 
matter on which it was supposed to act by its own spon- 
taneity. It is thought that Anaxagoras applied this con- 
ception only to the stellar heavens, “or, at least, used it 
only when mechanical principles failed” (103); but Diog- 
enes of Apollonia (later in the 5th century s.c.) identified 
this spontaneous or self-moving principle with air, which 
‘was for him the basic element, and he extended its action 
to organic bodies. 
Plato (429-348 B.c.) generalized the nous of Anaxagoras 
as a necessary basis for his teleological explanation of natural 
processes and made it immaterial, the Supreme Good, the
-P-A-G-E-26
  12 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
source of all conscious purposes and ends; that is, he made 
it an immaterial power spontaneously ordering the processes 
of nature, and acting upon them therefore as an outside force. 
Aristotle (384-322 3.c.), though departing from the dualism 
of Plato, assumed “souls” of various kinds and levels to 
account for vital processes, both vegetative and conscious. His 
use of the term “‘soul” must not, however, be confounded 
with the notion as developed by theological thought. To 
Aristotle, souls were indeed the primary movers and directive 
principles of both plant and animal activities or processes; 
but they were not separate entities, making a dualism as 
popular thought has it today, following more nearly after 
Plato; rather, they were attributes or organization of mat- 
ter itself, more like our scientific notions of functions or of 
tendencies toward certain ends (227, pages 1 ff.). He con- 
sequently assumed different souls for different sorts of ac- 
tivities or processes. Plant souls, animal souls, and human 
souls were the chief ones; but man, for instance, also had 
vegetative, locomotive, sensitive, and rational souls. Aris- 
totle’s notion of the different activities and forms of behavior 
whose causal sequences could, as we have seen, be directly 
traced, was evidently not markedly different from views held 
by the most advanced thinkers today — that forms of or- 
ganization rather than some outside or transcendental force 
condition the processes — and in his work psychology reached 
its highest development up to the modern period. 
Aristotle speaks of reason, nous, or intelligence in a dual 
sense: (1) as an active, supreme principle, the unmoved 
mover of all things. This more general aspect, while im- 
manent in man, is separable and imperishable, and is trans- 
cendent in the world. In this sense it is active and free in 
man, the source of all his insight and virtue, linking him to 
the divine. (2) It also has a passive aspect in man, as in 
the experiences which are mediated through bodily organs
-P-A-G-E-27
  Ancient and Popular Conceptions 13 
and stimulated from without, one that passes away with the 
individual in whom it appears (232, pages 149 ff.). The Pla- 
tonic conception of a transcendental nous played an important 
part in Neo-Platonism, and its influence is easily recogniz- 
able in popular notions of mind today. 
“INTELLECTUS”’ PUT THE EMPHASIS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS 
The Latin word intellectus was used to translate the Greek 
nous or reason, and received its meaning very largely from 
the Greek conception, especially the Aristotelian; but early 
in modern times it became limited to the cognitive functions, 
or the intellect, as distinguished from feeling and willing. 
These different functions came to be regarded as rather dis- 
tinct, especially in the faculty psychology, which assumed a 
variety of mental powers resembling arbitrary forces, as we 
have characterized them. 
THE INFLUENCE OF LOCKE’S RESEARCH 
Under the influence of authorities like John Locke (1632- 
1704) — whose great Essay Concerning Human Understand- 
ing (1690) aimed essentially to solve a special problem relating 
to knowledge — reason and understanding, as the intellectual 
functions were called, came to be regarded as the higher, 
more abstract aspects of our cognitive life as opposed to 
the perceptual and sensory processes. ~Locke maintained 
that all knowledge comes through the senses; that there are- 
no innate ideas, but that all ideas are derived from simple 
sense data. Later associationists, especially Hartley (127) 
and James Mill (164), developed this idea, and attempted to 
show that our mental life irs made up of trains of ideas con- 
nected by laws of association, derived from early concep- 
tions of molecular vibrations developed by Isaac Newton 
(1642-1727) and others. ‘Thus they attempted to show that 
order reigns in our mental life as in the physical world, and
-P-A-G-E-28
    14 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
in this sense they contributed much toward the science of 
psychology, but they also developed a very unsatisfactory 
view of ideas as discrete unities and neglected innate action 
tendencies, emotion, and general motivation factors. 
In thus building up logical abstractions which are really 
untrue of our behavior, as we shall see in subsequent pages, 
they merely developed an academic discipline which bears 
only a rather remote resemblance to the actual human be- 
havior that psychology seeks to understand and to control. 
One of the chief defects of associationism and of the intellect- 
ual philosophy connected with it was its failure to see that the 
individual, because of inherited organization and general 
metabolic changes, has at birth, without any immediate 
external stimulus, a very strong tendency to certain types of 
activity — that he is really born an acting individual. It was | 
the development of biology through the work of Charles 
Darwin (1809-1882) and the evolutionary school generally, 
and the experimentation on animal behavior, that did much 
to bring psychology to the current conception of intelligence 
and behavior. 
INNATE DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUALS NEGLECTED 
It was characteristic of the primitive views of intelligence as 
an arbitrary, spontaneous force that they overlooked entirely 
or to a large extent the individual differences among men, and 
this same neglect of so patent a fact is seen in faculty psychol- 
ogy and even in associationism. Self-moved forces and 
faculties might of course choose to do anything, and so in- 
dividual maladjustments and crimes were ascribed to an 
arbitrary will and were punished accordingly. Our inhuman 
doctrines of retributive punishment, now fortunately fading 
gradually from penology and religion, were logical results 
of these early views. Even associationism, based upon 
ideas derived from sense experience, ideas which but reflect
-P-A-G-E-29
  
Ancient and Popular Conceptions 15 
objects in the external world, naturally gave small considera- 
tion to individual differences — except in cases of deafness 
or blindness or other obvious sensory defects.’ With the 
same experiences why should the train of ideas in different 
minds not be identical? Differences were thus accounted 
for chiefly in terms of opportunity during the individual’s 
life; that is, they were differences in education. Only the 
later associationists found it worth while to take explicit 
note of innate individual differences. 
The popular mind today likewise neglects innate individual 
differences. Many of the weaknesses of our present educa- 
tional system are directly due to the view, now disappearing, 
that we are born “free and equal” in the sense that all alike 
can learn what the schools teach. Failures, according to 
this view, are attributed to stubbornness, laziness, etc., rather 
than to inability or to innate differences in the structure and 
organization of individuals. It is curious how popular 
thought has separated so-called mind from physical organi- 
zation; for it was obvious to every one that persons differed 
materially in size, weight, complexion, and so on. But mind, 
supposed to be immaterial and more or less arbitrary in its 
operation, was not thought to be handicapped by innate defi- 
ciencies. How could the laws of heredity, which in our day 
have become recognized by all, especially as applied to plants 
and domestic animals, be applied to such an immaterial 
thing as mind or intelligence ? 
It should be noted here, too, that in our schools the con- 
tent of the curriculum was at first made up largely of classi- 
fications and abstractions about language and numbers, and of 
other abstract relationships, materials organized by superior

and James pointed out that scientific discovery really demands in the in- 
dividual a certain “sagacity” or ability to see relationships and similarities 
in nature. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
minds who conceived all individuals to be like themselves. 
Thus grammar was largely the application to a live language 
of the logical forms of analysis developed in the study of dead 
languages, and arithmetic dealt principally with abstract 
relationships. It is only in our own day that the schools 
are beginning to put the emphasis on studies suitable to the 
several abilities of the children and on practical as opposed 
to so-called disciplinary subjects. The modern idea of test- 
ing the intelligence of a child who is beginning his education, 
to see what he is capable of doing, is yet foreign to many 
persons, even to many educators, but it has steadily made 
progress against resistance that is known only to those who 
have worked to give it wider application in our education 
and in the problems of our social and economic life. 
EXERCISES 
1. After reading the chapter write out the best definition of in- 
telligence that you can formulate, one that is free from any assump- 
tions of a spontaneous power and at the same time not influenced 
too much by the objectionable aspects of associationism. A good 
way to proceed is to write down first the main conceptions you wish 
to include in your definition, and then to organize them into a good 
statement of probably a single sentence. Do not do this carelessly 
or hastily, but let your definition be the best you can formulate now. 
You may desire to change it in certain particulars before we get 
through the book. Any change you may desire to make later will 
be a mark of your progress, if you now do the best you can. [The 
instructor will find it very useful to secure from each student a care- 
fully constructed definition before this chapter is read, to compare 
in later discussions with the one called for here. At the end of the 
course he may ask for a third definition.] 
2. Gather for class discussions all the illustrations of different 
conceptions that you have encountered, and endeavor to make a 
classification of them. 
8. Is there any objection to our thinking of intelligence as a 
mechanism? If so, what is the objection? See McDougall, Out- 
line of Psychology (1923), and also Psychological Review (1924), 31,
-P-A-G-E-31
Ancient and Popular Conceptions 17 
281-287, for different views. Consider the possibilities of the 
conception expressed by James in the quotation at the end of the 
article cited here. What is “freedom” on such a conception? Does 
it contradict the law of the conservation of energy? On the basis 
of this view, how does good intelligence differ from poor intelligence ? 
Is it true that if one’s behavior can be predicted it is not free? 
4, Illustrate what is meant by holding a person “responsible” 
for his conduct. On which view — mind as an arbitrary force, or 
mind as the potential operation of a very delicately adjustable and 
complex mechanism — is the holding of a person responsible for 
his acts most justifiable? Why? Consider the relation of this 
problem to the rapid learning of an individual under the application 
of regular and immediate reward for “right” acts and punishment 
for “wrong” ones.

InpIvipvaLs 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WERE NOT UNKNOWN TO THE 
ANCIENTS 
THERE is no question at all that man has recognized in- 
dividual differences in a practical sense from the very first. 
Even cattle and horses recognize some of their members as 
stronger and superior to others in a fight, and so certain 
individuals become leaders in a rather real sense. In the 
legends and early history of different peoples we find a similar 
recognition of individual differences. Thus Achilles is de- 
scribed in the Iliad of Homer as lion-hearted, swift-footed, 
and godlike; Ulysses as fertile in resources; and soon. So, 
too, the Greeks recognized extremely inferior individuals 
and exposed them to the beasts or otherwise destroyed them 
in infancy. ' Different racial traits of peoples with whom they 
came into contact were early recognized both by the Greeks and 
by the Romans. Even though some of these differences were 
not explicitly attributed to what we call nature as opposed to 
nurture, there is ample evidence that such innate individual 
differences were rather commonly recognized among early 
’ peoples. Thus Esau is described as being born “red all 
over like a hairy garment,” and so different from his twin 
brother, Jacob, that when the latter was to present himself 
to their blind father to secure Esau’s blessing it was necessary 
for Rebecca to put “skins of the kids of the goats upon his 
hands, and upon the smooth of his neck,” for, in Jacob’s 
own words, “Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a 
smooth man.” It is not clear to what extent the different 
mental qualities of the twin brothers were recognized as 
innate. The innate qualities must have been important in 
their minds, for Jacob was more “smooth” than his brother 
18
-P-A-G-E-33
  Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 19 
in a figurative sense as well as literally, and seems to have 
been selected for first place because of his greater fitness by 
nature. 
Wherever individuals came into close proximity it was 
inevitable that certain differences among them would be 
recognized, and in so far as this is true the limitations of 
personal wills and of other abilities would of necessity be 
implied. One would not voluntarily be stupid or inept. 
Hereditary conditions as well as environment were thus rec- 
ognized as having some weight, as imposing some limitations 
on the arbitrary mental powers. This position finds support 
in the study of the behavior of children. Unsophisticated 
as their view of mind is, they early recognize innate dif- 
ferences among themselves, and in codperative play the 
leaders assign réles to different individuals according to 
abilities that have become rather well known through 
habitual failure or success in certain kinds of performances ; 
and they are more outspoken than adults in the use of names 
to designate the characteristic abilities or lack of abilities 
detected in one another. 
EXTREME DIFFERENCES UNUSUAL AND THEREFORE PUZZLING 
Yet extreme individual variations presented their puzzling 
aspects. Idiots and great geniuses were comparatively 
seldom met, and their conscious lives could not be so easily 
entered into by the masses. Between the idiot and the com- 
mon man there was a barrier, due to the failure of the former 
to learn language and the common meanings of the group, 
and so the unfortunate one was looked upon as possessing 
some sort of foreign spirit. Inability of the feeble-minded 
and the insane to explain themselves and to enter into the 
thought of the group life was easily regarded as unwillingness 
to do so, and the natural consequence was too often pun- 
‘ishment and maltreatment. Even loathsome physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
diseases were rather naturally attributed to some sort of 
divine punishment, since their causes were unknown. Job’s 
misfortunes and physical distress were thus accounted for 
by his friends. The popular mind easily found justification 
for its attitude of neglect and torture of the mentally in- 
competent, for in these cases causal connections were far 
more difficult to trace than in the case of diseases. However, 
even when the latter were highly contagious, easily traced 
in their sequences, and therefore almost universal, they were 
looked upon as some sort of scourge or divine punishment sent 
upon the whole community because of unknown offense to 
the gods. 
THE FEEBLE-MINDED AND THE DERANGED COULD NOT ENTER 
THE SOCIAL LIFE 
Feeble-mindedness and mental derangement were strictly 
individualistic, never coming upon entire communities and 
never having been experienced by the normal person, so that 
belief in a supernatural cause of these ailments was bound to 
survive longer. It is much easier for all of us to see faults 
meriting punishment in others than in ourselves. Further- 
more, the mentally incompetent and deranged were not 
able to initiate and carry on investigations into the causes 
of their own troubles. Indeed, their defects were usually 
not known to or recognized by themselves — as a few hours’ 
visit to a mental hospital will soon demonstrate to a doubter 
—and so the very perverseness of the mentally deranged 
only gave additional grounds for their exclusion and mal- 
treatment. Since many of the insane '— especially those 
1 The insane are persons whose minds have been normal or practically 
normal, but who have become either demented or deranged in such a 
manner that they seriously misinterpret their relations to other individuals, 
while the feeble-minded (including three grades — idiocy, the most serious 
defect, imbecility, and moronity) are persons whose minds have never 
developed very far. These latter have remained seriously limited in ability 
from birth. The former are known as “dements” and the latter as 
“aments.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 21 
with such functional diseases as paranoia and some forms of 
dementia preecox — were generally more capable of justify- 
ing their behavior and views than were the feeble-minded, 
it is but natural that they would receive the more seri- 
ous opposition and mistreatment at the hands of normal 
persons. Jt was easier to understand that the feeble- 
minded were limited in their abilities and incapable, this 
being true to a considerable degree because their condition 
persisted from birth. The insane had once been more capable 
and more able to enter into the life of the normal community, 
but had withdrawn from this social life of common meanings. 
It was, therefore, perhaps natural that under such condi- 
tions the madness of the unfortunate, deranged minds was 
attributed to possession by some alien spirit. Thus Saul’s 
periods of depression were attributed to “the evil spirit 
of the Lord.” This interpretation of insanity is known as 
demonological. “The phenomena were regarded as the mani- 
festations of some spiritual being, god or demon, who either 
actually inhabited the body of his victim, or who merely 
played upon him from without. If the phenomena mani- 
fested were in harmony with the religious views of the time, 
it was concluded that the controlling spirit was benign in 
character, and the individual ‘possessed’ was revered as 
an exceptionally holy person. If, on the other hand, the 
individual’s conduct conflicted with the dominating ethical 
code, he was thought to be the victim of a malignant devil. 
As long as this view was generally accepted, it was natural 
that the only curative treatment in force was the employment 
of religious ceremonials and incantations”’ (126, pages 2 f.). 
It was most unfortunate for the victim of these mental dis- 
orders to be regarded as possessed of an evil spirit, for he 
would then in all probability become an outcast or be made 
to undergo certain tortures to make it so unpleasant for the 
devil possessing him that it might be induced to leave. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
demonological view is clearly expressed in the New Testa- 
ment, where we are told that the people brought to Jesus 
“many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the 
spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick” (Matt. 
8:16). 
Hippocrates, however, in the fifth century B.c. conceived 
a physiological view of insanity. Regarding the brain as 
the organ of the mind, he maintained that insanity was merely 
the result of some disturbance of this organ. This view 
was of comparatively short duration, however, and gave 
way through the Dark Ages to the demonological conception. 
It was not reéstablished until the nineteenth century, when 
it was definitely placed on a permanent footing by the 
advancement of science. 
Even from those who did not hold the “‘ possession” view, 
the insane received very little sympathy or understanding. 
These unfortunates were crowded into asylums in a way that 
we should not today treat our worst criminals. ‘‘Men cov- 
ered with filth cowered in cells of stone, cold, damp, without 
air or light, and furnished with a straw bed that was rarely 
renewed, and which soon became infectious — frightful dens 
where we should scruple to lodge the vilest animals. The 
insane thrown into these receptacles were at the mercy of 
their attendants, and these attendants were convicts from 
prison. The unhappy patients were loaded with chains and 
bound like galley slaves.”! It is beyond the scope of this 
book to trace out the changing conceptions of insanity and 
the humane treatment that finally resulted to the insane from 
regarding their behavior as the result of certain diseased con- 
ditions in the organism. To the insane, as well as to the nor- 
mal person, the advancement of science has indeed been a 
blessing and a protection.

THE FEEBLE-MINDED DID NOT DRAW THE ATTENTION OF 
MANY PERSONS 
We go back to a consideration of the feeble-minded, or 
aments, those who from birth have not grown normally in 
intelligence and who are therefore unable to make the 
required practical adjustments in life. On this class of ‘“‘ex- 
ceptional persons” we have very little authentic information 
dating back beyond the nineteenth century., Casual refer- 
ences to incompetent individuals may be found, but as these 
individuals are generally less dangerous and less inclined 
to oppose management and care by others, they have come 
down through the ages of human development and have 
fitted severally into the existing order of things as best they 
could, and have passed away each in his turn — little 
lamented, no doubt, by those on whom they have been bur- 
dens, and soon forgotten by the world. The higher grades — 
by far the most numerous — have easily become adapted to 
the performance of certain menial tasks, and so, in ages when 
education was not a common privilege of children, these 
individuals attracted little public notice. Unquestionably 
wise men in all ages have regarded the lowest grades of aments 
as innately defective in some way. The fact of their innate 
defectiveness is too patent to escape the notice of thinking 
men, since these individuals cannot learn to use language 
and thereby enter into the common life of their fellows. 
Facts now available through numerous studies of the men- 
tality of criminal persons make it clear that a large per cent 
of such persons are so seriously lacking in mentality as to be 
classed as feeble-minded. There are, of course, and have been 
in all ages, many normal persons, who fall into crime either — 
because of neglect in childhood or through group conflicts and 
consequent oppositions to society, or to public officers in 
whose actions they find or imagine they see imperfections of
-P-A-G-E-38
24 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
various sorts; but it is nevertheless true that in the main 
most criminal acts are short-sighted and stupid, and would 
be avoided by intelligent individuals. In many cases, of 
course, persons of very limited mental capacity become the 
henchmen or tools of able leaders who selfishly work for 
personal gain against the general social welfare, and so these 
unfortunate feeble-minded individuals become agents of 
crime. Recent investigations, however, have shown that | 
they do not usually, if indeed ever, have innate tendencies 
toward specific types of crime. Even their cruelties are 
largely accounted for merely on the basis of lack of sensibility 
and insight. 
THE ABILITIES OF MORONS USUALLY OVERESTIMATED 
Despite the present-day recognition of a physiological and 
even a hereditary basis of feeble-mindedness, there is a 
strong tendency, on becoming closely acquainted with them, 
always to act toward the unfortunate individuals suffering 
from this defect in its lighter forms as if they could themselves 
voluntarily better their condition. Mothers who come to 
clinics with such children will explain that they have con- 
stantly talked with them and have tried to get them to do 
so and so— often something that is wholly beyond the 
capacity of the unfortunate child in question. Only recently 
I was told of a feeble-minded boy whose mother had talked 
to him and labored with him to get him to see that he was 
not taking hold of his studies as he should do. Since the 
upper-grade feeble-minded and the simply dull persons are 
able to grasp our meanings in ordinary conversations and to 
enter into the common everyday social life of the group, we 
are likely to feel, when we come to abstractions into which we 
can ourselves pass without any felt difficulty, that it is pure 
arbitrariness on their part not to go on with us. This is 
especially noticeable when a bright, rather impatient person 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 25 
is attempting to teach or to assist a dull one in school sub- 
jects. Demonstration and explanation, often in abstract 
terms, go on for a short time; then the learner is confronted 
with a question or with an exercise or problem to be worked. 
When he hesitates unduly or makes a ridiculous blunder, he 
is scolded, belittled, or ridiculed, according to the relation- 
ship between the individuals. That is, the mentally in- 
ferior person is regarded more or less as rather arbitrarily or 
willfully failing to take advantage of the situation and to 
grasp the abstract principles involved, or as refusing to act in 
accordance with them, so prone are we to suppose that per- 
sons with whom we converse in normal social life apprehend 
all our meanings as we ourselves appreciate them. The 
simplest sort of experiments of the mental-test type will 
readily show the fallacy of this attitude, but it will take long 
practice to rid ourselves of it. 
It is not surprising, then, to find men in earlier times ready 
to inflict punishments upon those who apparently refused to 
participate in the common social life, nor to find that mentally 
disorganized persons were looked upon as possessed by some 
alien spirit and that they were reacted to accordingly. It 
is not a coincidence that in our own day persons who treat 
such unfortunates are called “alienists.”” 
THE ABILITIES OF THE GENIUS UNDERESTIMATED BY THE 
COMMON MAN 
On the other hand, persons of unusual ability have always 
been able to accomplish things that are so far beyond those 
done by the usual individual as to draw the attention of their 
fellows. It is an interesting fact that as a rule we overesti- 
mate what we are capable of doing and therefore usually 
give, for the fact that others accomplish more than we do, 
1It is a question whether a dull, slow, conscientious, and well-trained 
teacher is not far better for dull and feeble-minded students than a bright, 
mentally quick teacher.
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
some other explanation than that they have more ability. 
The reason for this overestimation of our own ability is prob- 
ably this: when a thing is done it is easier to understand how 
it was accomplished than it was to project it and carry it 
through originally, and so we underestimate in comparison 
with ourselves the person who first accomplished it. 
Some illustrations will readily make this fact clear. Chil- 
dren will often deny that once they could not talk and walk. 
Ask a small child how he learned to walk, and you will prob- 
ably get the reply: “I didn’t learn. I could always walk.” 
Unless we reflect carefully and invoke aid from the older 
members of our household, we probably all feel thus about our 
present views and many of our abilities which have been rather 
gradually and incidentally acquired. The things we have 
learned to do have either been acquired by a trial and error pro- 
cess or by an adaptation of something thus learned. Take learn- 
ing to talk, for instance. This was accomplished so gradually 
and so naturally by a process of trial and error that little mem- 
ory remains of the process. That is, we learned our vernacular 
by a process of struggling by varied reactions to acquire 
certain objects and to control certain individuals and situa- 
tions, with attention so much on these ends of action that the 
methods by which success was obtained and the useless acts 
that were eliminated almost wholly escaped our notice. We 
feel, then, that talking is really part of ourselves and that it is 
not an acquirement. And so for other abilities. 
And just as we tend to overestimate inferiors by failing to 
see their limitations, and, knowing that we ourselves can 
easily “will” to do this or that, we feel that they can do 
likewise, so we underestimate the powers of geniuses or greatly 
superior persons. Not having lived through their struggles 
and not having had the opportunity of measuring skill with 
them and of seeing how here and there in almost everything 
they undertook they accomplished more than we could have
-P-A-G-E-41
  
Treatment of Exceptional Individuals Q7 
done, we naturally “perceive” their abilities as like our 
own. 
It is also to be remarked that most performances of genius 
are based on a persistence that is not characteristic of the 
common man. The genius seems to have an unusual ability 
_ to occupy himself, against various distractions, with remote 
ends and conditions and to feel a satisfaction in these things. 
This is probably what Galton meant when he said, as we 
shall presently see, that genius is characterized by exceptional 
energy. It is probably well, however, to distinguish between 
this persistence in activity of remote bearing and mere 
energy; for many persons of ordinary ability seem to have 
great energy, but they waste it in acts of little moment be- 
cause of a failure to be motivated by remote and significant 
relationships. 
GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO SUPERNATURAL AID 
The performances of the genius, therefore, which count in 
the long run and finally put him conspicuously before his 
fellows, must somehow be accounted for or explained by the 
latter. Not recognizing his superior abilities as due to innate 
conditions, they are likely to ascribe his success — not 
rationally, perhaps, but. perceptually — to some external 
agency such as inspiration from supernatural sources or 
“‘possession” by some benign spirit. Similar success there- 
fore would be sought through propitiation and favor ob- 
tained by means of various sorts of religious appeals and cere- 
monials. There is no question, moreover, that opportunity 
of the kind and at the time suitable to one’s genius is a further 
factor necessary for success (93; 3, Chapter 18; 139; 90). 
GENIUSES OFTEN MISUNDERSTAND THEMSELVES 
But probably the most interesting and instructive point ’ 
is that even the genius himself may be misled, just as the
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
untrained observer is misled, with respect to causal factors 
in his own will. Our best thoughts often do not come to us 
when we are actively struggling to solve some problem, 
but are likely to come in a moment of relaxation. It is 
well known that after we have been embarrassed by failure 
to recall names of friends just when we needed them, the 
names will come to our minds when the occasion demanding 
them is past. Thus the genius, who for long periods of time 
has been working at certain problems from all angles, getting 
numerous data bearing on the subject, may in rather passive 
moments chance to get the proper elements together by asso- 
ciation, when presto! the problem is solved. It has solved 
itself! Often ideas that thus come to mind (as well as cer- 
tain automatisms) seem actually to be forced on one as if by 
some outside agency, so that a person thus assisted may, if 
unaccustomed to thinking in naturalistic terms, be deceived 
into the thought that the causal factor is some supernatural 
agency. Thus the genius becomes to others, and often also 
to himself, an example of the operation in a mind of mysteri- 
ous outside forces, and the natural sequence of events is lost 
sight of either completely or to a considerable extent. Here 
again the interactions upon one another of various part- 
processes in the organism are of such a nature as to modify 
the effects of immediate objective stimuli, thus concealing 
the sequence of natural events to the extent that the effects of 
present stimuli, which fail to evoke direct and immediate 
responses, are overlooked. The cumulative effects in the 
organism of various experiences thus become lost to human 
observation, and the behavior, though a function of the com- 
plex external situation, both present and past, comes to be 
regarded as disconnected from natural antecedent conditions 
as if it were some manifestation of forces without the system 
of nature. The alleged messages of “‘mediums” are good 
illustrations of extreme forms of this, and they are not always 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 29 
mere deception of others, but are often unintended self- 
deception.! 
From the foregoing considerations, as well as from those in 
the previous chapter dealing with causal relations in mental 
processes, we see that it is but natural that the genius who 
meets successfully great emergencies in the social life, like the 
mentally deranged person who seems to be dominated by 
opposing arbitrary forces, should be looked upon as under the 
influence of extraneous forces or minds. They are therefore 
examples, the one class as well as the other, of individuals 
whose behavior is somehow outside the pale of the normal, 
and so have been classed together. Prophets as well as 
deranged individuals have been regarded as inspired by evil 
powers, and both likewise have been considered spokesmen of 
the divine will, their classification depending on whether or 
not their contributions were acceptable to the group. Para- 
noiacs have now and then become for a time successful leaders 
of groups, whereas long-visioned leaders have been put to 
death or cast out of the groups. 
RELATIONS OF GENIUS TO MENTAL DEFICIENCY 
A modern school headed by Lombroso has held, on a some- 
what more scientific basis, that both the genius and the idiot, 
being unusual variations from the norm, have much in com- 
mon and are both unstable types; that in every genius there 
are marks of degeneracy and in every degenerate or feeble- 
minded person there are certain marks of genius. While it 
is undeniable that some feeble-minded persons have special 
gifts (221), and also that certain geniuses have shown signs 
1 This statement is made in a sort of dogmatic fashion, simply because 
the writer feels sure that it is a true account of numerous cases known to 
any reader. He does not, however, wish to close the reader’s mind to other 
possible explanations or to make him unsympathetic with experimental 
work in the rather forbidden field called (or miscalled) “psychic research.” 
We must have open minds as long as the evidence is not convincing to all 
scientific investigators.  
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
of degenerate tendencies, it is now known that these extreme 
types of mentalities, instead of being much alike, are really 
each more like the normal individual than like the other 
extreme. They are both of them “variations from the nor- 
mal,” it is true, but opposite variations. Superior ability 
has been shown to be closely associated in heredity through 
successive generations (123, 236), and feeble-mindedness 
likewise, though being in some cases closely related to cer- 
tain forms of dementia, is highly hereditary (122, 123). 
As a result of these various studies and extensive testing, 
and also of the general development of psychology, the be- 
havior of all individuals, normal, subnormal, and super- 
normal, is regarded by psychologists as following natural laws 
just as other events in nature do, even though the causal 
relations, for reasons already given, are in many cases so 
concealed that only careful scientific research can trace the 
different results of stimulations back to their proper sources. 
The general fact that definite causal relations obtain in all 
our behavior is yet far from demonstrated, and many per- 
sons, even including some scientifically trained individuals, 
still believe in supernatural interferences in human behavior. 
The evidence in a large sense is now so strongly in favor of 
the naturalistic interpretation of all behavior that in many 
minds there is not even any alternative hypothesis enter- 
tained. Extensive studies of the destinies of certain families - 
or groups, as well as detailed investigations of alleged medi- 
umship, of genius, of conversion phenomena, and of alleged 
inspiration all point in the same direction and strengthen 
the view that “mental processes,” or behavior in general, 
follow laws just as truly as physical processes do. The mind 
of the defective is simply not equal to the task of adjustment 
to the complexities of his environment, and so maladjust- 
ments arise. These maladjustments are not usually sudden 
and immediately obvious, though on occasions marked in-
-P-A-G-E-45
Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 31 
competency to deal with a situation may be seen. Usually 
the single maladjustments are so small as to escape notice. 
The general effect of them is more obvious to everybody, and 
the unfortunate defective is frequently regarded as not will- 
ing to put forth the effort to succeed. 
INSANITY COMMONLY MISUNDERSTOOD 
In certain extreme types of mental disorganization it is so 
obvious that the person is acting contrary to his usual con- 
duct and that he is irrational, — that is to say, fails to take 
into consideration the more remote bearings of his acts, — 
that we call him insane. Insane persons are confined in 
mental hospitals where they are seen by only a small part of 
the people. This isolation, as well as the rash acts commit- 
ted by certain persons before they are confined, leads many 
persons to think of the insane as a different species of human- 
ity, whose mental life is wholly discontinuous and whose 
acts are therefore so disjointed that it is impossible to say 
what will be the next act. This is a grossly exaggerated 
view of the discontinuity of the behavior of insane persons. 
Indeed, those attendants and physicians who care for the 
insane soon learn the repertory of each inmate so well that 
they can anticipate most of his acts just as regularly as we 
can predict what one of our fellows, with whom we associate 
closely, will do under certain conditions. Each insane per- 
son has his cycle of activities and of emotional ups and downs 
which soon come to be well known, because, indeed, they are 
so simple. If they seem to the stranger to be impulsive and 
wholly discontinuous, this is only because they are condi- 
tioned to a larger extent than is true of normal persons 
by various internal and unnatural stimuli, such as infections, 
excessive secretions of ductless glands, and so on. The 
“individual thus affected is consequently unable to respond 
in the manner that we ourselves would do to the various 
y
-P-A-G-E-46
32 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
objective circumstances so obvious to us and so influential in 
behavior. Any person who has seen a relative or a friend 
in a delirium knows how much the poison in his blood out- 
weighs the effects of external conditions and makes him re- 
spond in ways that seem wholly irrational. While all cases 
of insanity are not so directly and obviously caused by inner 
organic disturbances as these statements may seem to im- 
ply, there is little doubt that every case is conditioned by 
an organic or physiological disorder of some sort, often too 
delicate and functional in its nature to be susceptible of 
definite location. 
The popular, and to a large extent even the legal, idea of 
insanity reflects the older notion that the normal mind is 
a sort of mysteriously arbitrary force in itself and that 
when deranged it entirely loses its direction and its means 
of control. The ordinary layman supposes that to find a 
person “‘insane”’ is to understand his case, and unfortunately 
the courts are not far in advance of this notion. Insanity 
is not sufficiently recognized as a purely relative term, one 
that may mean one thing in one case and almost a totally 
different thing in another, a degree of irresponsibility being 
possibly the only thing common to all. But what is irre- 
sponsibility and why is the person irresponsible? A per- 
fectly normal young child is also irresponsible. If we seek 
to know why an insane person is irresponsible, we shall find 
almost as many answers as there are insane individuals. 
No two cases are quite alike, just as no two adult normal 
persons are alike. Even the names for special types of 
disorders — such as dementia preecox, paranoia, hysteria, 
manic-depressive psychosis — are not free from this lack of 
definiteness as to what they imply. 
All these classifications of disordered minds are made for 
certain practical purposes. If a disorganized person is found 
to show certain symptoms common to a class of other cases, 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  Treatment of Exceptional Individuals 33 
it is but natural to suppose that the causes of his mental 
derangement are somewhat like those common to this class 
of cases, and to attempt a prognostication on the basis of 
the developments that were observed in the other cases. 
But the human organism is vastly too complex for any marked 
similarities to be found between two such persons without the 
occurrence at the same time of striking differences. Quali- 
fying terms or hyphenated names— such as paranoid- 
dementia preecox — thus are invented to cover new classes 
of cases, and finally we have a complex classification the 
names of which often satisfy the popular or the formal mind, 
and stand for it as designations of rather distinct and well- 
marked types of insanity. 
When a person with such views visits a mental hospital, 
he finds no good or perfect representatives of the functional 
types of classes of mental derangement that he has learned, 
but, instead of this, a number of individuals differing 
markedly among one another, and shading off gradually in 
the symptoms they show into other types classed under dif- 
ferent names. Confusion therefore results, and if he comes 
to have close and varied experiences with these several in- 
dividuals and to know their different “histories,” individual- 
ities, and possibilities, he in time really becomes able to study 
their behavior in a causal manner, just as he is able to do with 
his intimate normal associates. It is only then that he can 
take a really rational attitude toward them and see the prac- 
tical value of certain groupings. Until this stage is reached 
any person is likely to regard the insane of different classifi- 
cations as somehow ruled by the dominance of certain mys- 
tical, arbitrary faculties, instead of considering each one as 
responding in the manner that his inherited and acquired 
organization permits, and indeed determines, in the circum- 
stances or conditions under which he is placed. 
Tn the case of the insane, as in that of normal persons, both
-P-A-G-E-48
  34 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
habits and innate structure or organization have much in- 
fluence on behavior, and mind when studied at close range 
and scientifically loses its arbitrariness and mystical qualities, 
This statement does not imply that any one now knows all 
the intricacies of our numerous mental operations. The 
human organism is so extremely complex as to lead us to 
expect that it will never be understood in all details. At 
present we have made but a fair beginning toward the scien- 
tific understanding and control of human behavior. But 
the things we have found out are so useful and important as 
amply to reward all the efforts that have been put forth. 
We are coming to see mind and personality as aspects of the 
processes of nature. How this happy result has been attained 
we shall see in subsequent chapters. 
EXERCISES 
1. On the basis of the view expressed in this chapter, why are 
some people afraid of being alone with a corpse? Some persons are 
genuinely afraid of the brains of a human being. How do you 
account for this fear? Why are “spiritualistic’” phenomena often 
feared ? 
2. Select various examples of the assumption of supernatural or 
arbitrary forces in behavior or in nature, and test the statements 
made in the text by a study of them. It would be well to embody 
the results of your study in a short, critical paper. Be as impartial 
as you can, even if this is difficult; remember that we are looking 
for facts, not for ultimate explanations of nature. 
8. How does the assumption of demonology differ from the view 
that “gravitation” makes objects fall ? ° 
4. Select examples of reactions to the work of morons and of 
geniuses by the unsophisticated person, and test the assertions in 
the text about the overestimation of morons and the underestima- 
tion of geniuses. Do people usually overestimate or underestimate 
their own abilities? Give evidence.

CHAPTER THREE 
INTELLIGENCE CONCEIVED AS A CoMPLEX OF INTELLECTUAL 
FacuLties 
THE ELEVATION OF THE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS BY THE GREEKS 
Tue early Greeks, to whom we look for the beginnings of 
philosophical speculations that later developed into various 
of our fundamental sciences, did not overlook man himself 
as an object of study. The conflict of different inner im- 
pulses, the purposive nature of human actions, and the spon- 
taneity that every person feels in his own mental operations 
were recognized by them, and were explained by assumptions 
of vital, spontaneous principles, or souls, which were con- 
ceived as regulating and directing in a measure the 
individual’s thoughts and activities. Modern views of in- 
telligence are still influenced to a very considerable extent 
by conceptions of this kind, and it is important to trace the 
development of these views of spontaneous faculties and to 
see how the supposed powers constituting intelligence became 
limited to the cognitive powers, as opposed to feeling and 
will. 
Plato recognized an important division in man, which, 
by him, was characterized as | desire, on the one hand, and 
reason on the other. These were attributed to the “irrational 
soul” and to the “rational soul,” respectively. The rational 
soul was located in the head and the irrational soul, which 
was divided into a better and a worse part, was placed in the 
body. The better part was ascribed to the heart and was 
supposed to function in manifestations of energy, courage, 
and ambition, while the worse part was placed below the 
diaphragm and was thought to manifest itself in desire and 
in the nutritive functions (74, page 68). It has been a 
characteristic of thought ever since Plato’s time to elevate 
35
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
reason more or less as an exalted desire-free faculty, while the 
nutritive functions have been considered of slight importance, 
little worthy of study, and often needing suppression for the 
sake of the higher souls or faculties, to which these lower ones 
were seemingly in opposition. _ i 
For Plato the higher, or rational, soul gradually establishes 
greater independence of external movements affecting the 
body. “In the beginning there is a chaos of movement, all 
possible forms of external movement taking effect on the 
body which aimlessly yields to every force. This state can 
never be quite superseded in the life of a human being, be- 
cause he is always in intimate connection with the. outer 
world” (74, page 72). Sensation is impossible to the soul in 
the early chaotic condition of the whole organism, for it 
implies an inner discriminative reaction, or “motion,” of the 
soul. Sensation emerges only when a certain degree of 
order is established. But the life of mortal man can never 
quite free itself from the outer world, a desirable accom- 
plishment for Plato. 
In sleep the soul is cut off from external influences, but 
often a certain amount of agitation remains; and thus dreams 
were explained. “‘‘If the quiet is profound, sleep with few 
dreams falls on us; but if some of the stronger motions are 
left, according to their nature and the places where they remain 
they engender visions corresponding in number and kind.’ 
On the meaning of dreams Plato speaks a little uncertainly. 
He regards them sometimes as an activity of the desiring| 
part of the soul, and in the Republic a remarkable passage 
on the moral character of dreams shows that he considered 
them the expression of desires which are usually suppressed” 
(74, page 70). One is reminded here of the Freudian theory} 
of dreams, which, however, restricts the field of the desires, 
thus being less true to life than was Plato. The good man, i 
whom the rational soul prevails, is to suppress these rebel

lious activities of the desires, for in him desires and ambition 
  must give place to the rational life. Brett points out that in - 
the Timeus Plato seems to regard dreams, inspiration, and 
possession alike as mere abnormal conditions, ‘“‘or at best a 
dim expression of desires that might indicate some reaching 
out after the final objects of desire and so be, as it were, in- 
timations of things eternal,” reminding one somewhat of 
James’s view (140, pages 151 ff. and 189 ff.) ; while in the 
Republic “he seems to favor the idea that in sleep the 
rational soul, if it is not troubled by the irrational parts, can 
attain truths not otherwise revealed” (74, page 71). 
For Plato, knowledge is the result of an inner activity of 
the rational soul, but, as we have seen, it is by no means 
always “‘pure.” Certain activities were thought to be inter- 
mediate between rational knowledge and the more passive 
“affections,” or sensory impressions, though these received 
scant attention. These activities are memory, association, 
imagination, and emotion. In his later writings “the lower 
parts of the soul are conceived as acquisitions of the earthly 
life, so that the original nature of the soul appears as a purely 
cognitive power” (101, page 12). Thus the perceptual and 
particular is subordinated to the conceptual and universal. 
It is because the human soul carries within itself conceptual 
images that it is able to apprehend the universal. 
Thus we find in Plato a strong emphasis on the higher 
rational functions, an emphasis that doubtless has had much 
weight in the history of psychology. This tendency is con- 
tinued in the work of Aristotle, for whom reason gives form 
and movement to nature. Aristotle divided mental func- 
tions into the “cognitive powers’ — knowledge and reason — 
on the one hand, and the “motive powers” — feeling, desire, 
and action — on the other. ‘This division,” says Baldwin, 
“survived until the threefold Kantian classification of intel- 
lect, feeling, and will came in” (9, page 77). For Aristotle 
  *
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
all perceptions were accompanied by pleasure and displeas- 
ure, and these feelings themselves were regarded as indica- 
tions of free or of obstructed activity of the cognitive and 
motive powers, pleasure indicating unhindered and displeas- 
ure hindered activity. Emotions, which were likely to dis- 
turb the judgment and therefore were not in high favor, 
resulted from a mixture of these feelings. 
For Aristotle as for Plato, sensation is not a mere. passive 
impression, and nothing is transmitted thereby to the soul, 
contrary to the contentions of the Greek atomists of the fifth 
century B.c. The object stimulating the sense is not like the 
sensation, but the latter must nevertheless correspond in 
some way to that object. What they have in common is 
“form’’ (nearly our figure, or shape, or organization) as dis- 
tinct from matter. “Form” is a term that was made much 
of by Aristotle, but that fell into disfavor with the waning of 
his influence. Kant used “‘form” in only a slightly different 
meaning, as a category of perception. For Aristotle objects 
in the world could therefore be perceived only in as far as 
they admit of assimilation by some one or more of the various 
sense forms. But the true sense organ is not the “flesh” 
in any particular case; it is rather a “common sense” 
located in the heart. It is only by means of this common 
sense that perceptions and images of the various sense organs 
obtain unity and consistency. In this common sense, too, 
is where the judgment of true and false takes place. The 
effects of outer stimulation of the senses were supposed to 
be transmitted to the common sense by a substance or 
organism of a sensitive nature spread through the body and 
acting as a universal medium of sensation — the forerunner 
of the later term “animal spirits,” and of our modern term 
“nerve impulse.” 
After the stimulating object is removed inner motions per- 
sist, and these motions, by restimulating the central sense,
-P-A-G-E-53
    
Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 39 
reproduce in consciousness the same effect, as far as form is 
concerned, that the sensible object produced. It is thus 
that images or presentations come about, and their repro- 
duction in the absence of the original stimulus was by 
Aristotle called ‘“‘imagination.” “By virtue of these inner 
movements, which are psychic, man is able to store up and 
reproduce many images, and one image may be the cause of 
another, or more correctly one movement may set up another 
movement which previously occurred in some relation with 
it. The possibility of storing up the movement is the con- 
dition of memory” (74, page 124). Without the relation of 
such movements memory is not possible, for such retention 
is the condition of memory, though it is not memory itself. 
“Memory is a condition in which an image present to mind 
is known to be the copy of an object which had been present 
itself on some former occasion” (page 125). Thus memory 
always involves more time than the immediate movement, 
an important point to which we shall return when we come 
to later conceptions of intelligence. Recollection is the vol- 
untary effort or activity which, by exciting an idea, creates 
a stimulus for a chain of ideas on the basis of the laws of 
association, as we should now say; but for Aristotle this does 
not preclude a sort of self-initiation manifested in the vol- 
untary effort which takes us at once to the essence of reason. 
It is by the common sense that images, through contiguity, 
similarity, and contrast, become memories, dreams, and 
fancies; that judgments of things as true or false are made ; 
that “sensible qualities” — motion, number, shape, size, 
etc. — are attributed to things; and that unity is given 
to our experiences. But the constructive imagination is 
mecessary to thought just as sensation is to imagination; 
it supplies the schemata to reason (9, pages 72 ff.). Aris- 
totle’s emphasis on thought proper is indicated by the fact 
that he contributed what is known as the “Aristotelian logic.”
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
“The theory of syllogistic inference sprang full-formed from 
the brain of Aristotle,” says Baldwin (page 79). 
THE INFLUENCE OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE 
These were the high marks of psychological development 
in the ancient world. For centuries men quoted these mas- 
ters. The views of Plato were made suitable for religious 
purposes and so through Neo-Platonism exercised a great 
influence on Christianity. Saint Augustine (354430), 
however, was greatly influenced by Aristotle. ‘He held 
that the soul was to be approached and known directly 
through consciousness; that it was immaterial in character 
and immortal; that inner observation was possible and nec- 
essary. From such observation, he found that the mental 
life was one of continual movement in the one spiritual prin- 
ciple, and [that it] showed itself in three fundamental func- 
tions : intellect (intellectus), will (voluntas), and ‘self-conscious 
memory’ (perhaps the best rendering of memoria, as Saint 
Augustine used the term). The fundamental moving prin- 
ciple of the entire mental life is will. The other functions 
manifest will” (9, pages 96 f.). The dualism of mind (the 
active controlling principle) and matter (the inert substance 
upon which it acted) left its stamp deeply on the thought and 
entire life of the Middle Ages, as is well known, and it is still 
the dominant view of popular thought, as we have already 
shown. 
_ The confusions and breakdowns of older systems of thought 
resulting in the Renaissance and in the inventions, discov- 
eries, and renewed interest in life in the world, threw new 
demands on reconstructive thinking and empirical methods; 
but dualism and pure rationalistic methods were too thor- 
oughly impressed on the culture of the times not to show 
themselves strongly. Empirical methods were much more 
easily applied to objective, physical phenomena than to the
-P-A-G-E-55
  Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 41 
mind of man, and so the scientific development of psychology 
was still to be retarded a long period of time. 
THE ORIGIN OF MODERN DUALISM AND OF CONCEPTIONS 
OF INNATE IDEAS 
René Descartes (1596-1650), a man of a strong mathe- 
matical and rationalistic turn of mind, steeped so thoroughly 
in the learning of his time and yet so able to see its weaknesses 
and errors, “‘stands,’’ as Baldwin has so well said, “at the 
portals of modern philosophy and psychology” (9, page 131). 
If an empiricist had led out in modern psychology with an 
objective study of the behavior of animals and children, we 
might have had a radically different science today from that 
which was so greatly influenced by superior minds steeped 
in rationalism, looking in upon themselves for the facts of 
psychology. Descartes opened up the way for an independ-_ 
ent consideration of the mental processes, but he was an 
extreme dualist, holding to a sharp distinction between mind 
and matter, and he opened up explicitly the philosophical 
difficulties involved in views of their interaction. His em- 
pirical tendencies show themselves in his treatment of per- 
ception and of the passions, tendencies influenced by Kepler, 
an early contemporary, who died when Descartes was thirty- 
four years old. 
Descartes found it necessary to discard as “untrust- 
worthy” the writings of the ancients. “I cannot have any 
hope of reaching the truth, except by abandoning the paths 
which they have followed,” he said. “All that which we 
experience in ourselves which we can also see take place in 
bodies entirely inanimate is to be attributed only to our 
body; and, on the contrary, all that which is in us and 
which we cannot conceive in any manner possible to pertain 
to a body is to be attributed to our soul” (181, pages 168 f.). 
Heat and movements of limbs are of the body and come from 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
the physical world, but thoughts come from the soul, which, 
for him, has spontaneous powers that it can exert on matter. 
The soul departs at death because heat fails and the organs 
decay — not the reverse, as has been held. The life processes _ 
are therefore not due to the soul, but to all automatic bodily 
movements which “‘run down” as a clock may do. He gives 
an interesting account of. these processes, including circula- 
tion of the blood, which recently had been discovered by 
Harvey (in 1628), and which was understood by those “whom 
the authority of the ancients had not entirely blinded” 
(181, page 171). The force of the blood and of the “‘animal 
spirits’ — a term which has given way to the more modern 
term “nerve impulse” — being sent with varying strength | 
and in different directions by “outside motions” (external | 
stimuli) and by bodily changes themselves, may explain, he 
holds, how the bodily movements are automatically performed 
‘without the aid of the soul.” All lower animals are autom- 
ata; they have no souls. In man the soul operates from 
a point of the pineal gland, which seems to be centrally 
located at the confluence of the blood vessels and nerves, and 
where structures are not double or bilateral as are most struc- 
tures of the brain, and it controls voluntary action by divert- 
ing the blood flow and the animal spirits as is necessary for 
the desired actions. This view contradicts his principle of 
the conservation of energy, but he thought that “only the 
total amount of motion in space, not however the! direction 
thereof, is unchangeable” (101, page 91). Thus Descartes 
dispensed with all the souls of the ancients but the rational 
soul. This soul gets its perceptions from the various motions 
of the animal spirits coming against the pineal gland. It 
also, “by the simple fact of its willing anything,” modifies 
the course of these animal spirits from this point and thus 
regulates action. Thus the higher intellectual operations, in so 
far as they are not automatic, are manifestations of its activity.

  Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 43 
These extracts give the reader an idea of Descartes’ inde- 
pendence and originality and of his general point of view. 
It is clear that, while he lays open a most interesting field 
in the study of these automatic processes, including most of 
the emotional disturbances, he points the way to the higher 
intellectual faculties as the most fruitful and dignified study 
of man. The intellectual, self-conscious part of man be- 
longed for him to the soul, which does not have spatial or 
temporal attributes but to which are attributed such activi- 
ties as perceiving, knowing, and willing. The soul’s main 
characteristic is self-consciousness, but besides this immedi- 
ate knowledge of itself the soul also has certain innate ideas 
— ideas of extension, number, duration, existence, cause and 
effect, etc. — as principles which are basic to its thinking. 
Here his mathematical training shows itself. When he 
comes to certainty of knowledge, he finds that all knowledge 
rests on self-existence as introspectively manifested: “I 
think, therefore I am” (cogito, ergo sum). The real self is 
not a developing thing: it is that which an adult philosopher 
can find by looking in upon himself, as it were. But we 
must not enter into Descartes’ interesting philosophy except 
simply to indicate that he opened up certain problems of 
knowledge which under the conditions of his time were bound 
to usurp much of the attention of the scholars and to.direct 
tt particularly to the higher thought processes. 
Geulincx (1625-1669) and Malebranche (1638-1715) con- 
sidered the difficulties which Descartes’ dualism had so ex- 
plicitly disclosed and attempted to distinguish between the 
cause of an event and the circumstances under which it 
acts. This was a superficial distinction showing ulterior 
purposes or theological and free-will interests which, by seek- 
ing merely to support certain views already held rather than 
to discover truth unaffected by bias and current social 
concepts, operate against a purely scientific procedure. But
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Malebranche made several contributions to the development 
of psychology. He was the first one to apprehend, says 
Dessoir (101, page 99), that because of this two-sided cor- 
respondence between mind and body, a sort of parallelistic 
hypothesis might be useful to psychology. Such an hypothe- 
sis is stated, for instance, by Titchener (219, pages 13 ff.) 
and by Stratton (205, Chapter 14). Contrary to Descartes, 
Malebranche did not suppose that the “inner sense,” or 
awareness of one’s own mental states, gives any knowledge 
or proof of the soul, but only of the phenomena of conscious- 
ness. He thus contributed toward freeing psychology from 
philosophical speculations and methods, and he became dis- 
tinguished for useful investigations of perceptual processes, 
in the line that had received a great impetus through the work 
of the Arabian physiological psychologists more than six 
centuries earlier, particularly that of Alhacen. 
The dualistic theory was developed by the great Jewish 
philosopher Spinoza (1632-1677) into a form which many 
psychologists have found satisfactory as a hypothesis, given 
the “mind and matter’ dualism which has been bequeathed 
to them from philosophy. Accepting Descartes’ distinction 
between mind and matter and also his principle of the con- 
servation of energy — that the total amount of “motion” 
in the universe is fixed — he perceived clearly the impossibil- 
ity of interaction between mind and matter, and formulated 
another principle regarded as equally indisputable, the strict 
correlation between changes taking place in these two “attri- 
butes” of the one infinite substance, God: “‘the order and 
connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection 
of things ” (9, page 143). In short, mind and matter are but 
two aspects, or attributes, of the ultimate reality. 
Although Spinoza recognized the empirical origin of our 
knowledge of external objects in the world, he nevertheless 
laid solidly the foundation for innate conceptions, or innate
-P-A-G-E-59
  Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 45 
ideas, which, arising from pure reason, have the advantage 
of being clear and distinct. They are apprehended immedi- 
ately as being true. He, of course, refers to such things as 
mathematical axioms, another of our intellectual inheritances 
of the past. 
The great philosopher Leibnitz (1646-1716), who shares 
with Newton (1642-1727) the distinction of having invented 
(in 1675) the differential calculus, gave strong support to the 
doctrine of innate ideas, and therefore he was an important 
factor in stimulating the British empiricism, as we shall 
presently see. 
THE BRITISH EMPIRICAL MOVEMENT 
To this movement we now turn. Hobbes (1588-1679) 
begins an extremely empirical reaction by attempting to 
bring under the dominance of natural or mechanical processes 
the entire behavior of man (130, 131). He was himself a 
mild and timid man, though an energetic thinker and con- 
troversialist. While traveling in continental Europe, he 
became personally acquainted in Italy with Galileo (1564— 
1642), and in France with Gassendi (1592-1655), the mathe- 
matician and atomist, from whose writings Newton derived 
the atomic theory and adapted it to chemistry. Hobbes, 
however, seems to have arrived independently at the theory 
that all change is motion, and in a discussion with friends he 
came to the conclusion that if there were no motion there 
would be no sensation. ‘A change of motion is therefore 
the condition of sensation. For sensing unceasingly one and 
the same thing and sensing nothing at all amounts to the 
same thing” (133, page 59). This principle, accepted early 
in his life, makes the basis of his psychology. He rejects 
the view of Descartes, that mind is a separate substance 
different from body. Thinking does imply a thinking thing 
just as walking does, but that thing is the body. Mindis a
-P-A-G-E-60
  
46 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
function of the body and reason is a product of sensation. 
““Man’s nature is the sum of his natural faculties and powers, 
as the faculties of nutrition, motion, generation, sense, reason, 
etc.,” said Hobbes, clearly using the term “faculties” as we 
might use “functions.” ‘“‘These powers we do unanimously 
call natural, and are contained in the definition of man, under 
these words, animal and rational”’ (131, Chapter 1; 181, page 
147). He proceeds to divide man’s faculties, according to these 
two principal parts, into (1) those of the body — nutritive, mo- 
tive, and generative — and (2) those of the mind — cognitive 
and motive. The cognitive, or conceptive, power of man 
is that “faculty or power by which we are capable of” such 
knowledge and imagination as we have of the things in the 
outer world, things whose images or conceptions would 
remain even if they themselves were destroyed. All these 
conceptions come originally from the action of the things 
themselves on our organs, producing sensations on which all 
knowledge of the outer world is based. So all our sense ex- 
periences are but “‘apparitions” of the motion which works 
on “the brain, or spirits, or some internal substance of the 
head.” But he also recognizes that inward bodily disturb- 
ances as well as outward stimulations serve to recall images 
(association). Thus “the causes of dreams, if they be 
natural, are the actions or violence of the inward parts of 
man upon his brain, by which the passages of sense by sleep 
benumbed, are restored to their motion” (181, page 153). 
These sense data, and the images which result from them, 
when the action on the senses has ceased, are not inherited. 
It is only the sentient power that is inherited. The outer 
stimulations set up motions about the heart some of which 
either help or hinder the vital processes, thus conditioning 
either pleasure or pain, as the case may be, and bringing about 
various complex experiences and also tendencies “to draw 
near to the thing that pleaseth, or to retire from the thing 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 47 
that displeaseth.” Beliefs, passions, and will are built upon 
these foundations by various associations and inner motions, 
and thus is laid, though not very consistently by Hobbes, 
a foundation for a strong emphasis by empiricism on the 
intellectual or cognitive functions. 
This tendency was greatly strengthened by Locke (1632- 
1704), by whom modern psychology texts are more influenced 
than most readers of them suspect. Locke’s problem and 
_ its origin are thus briefly put by himself in his “Epistle to 
- the Reader and Introduction” of his Essay (158): ‘‘Were it 
fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay I should tell 
thee, that five or six friends, meeting at my chamber, and 
discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found them- 
selves quickly at a stand by the difficulties that arose on 
every side. After we had awhile puzzled ourselves without 
coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which per- 
plexed us, it came to my thoughts, that we took a wrong 
course; and that, before we set ourselves upon inquiries 
of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities, 
and see what objects our understandings were or were not 
fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all 
readily assented ; and therefore it was agreed, that this should 
be our first inquiry.” “This, therefore, being my pur- 
pose, to inquire into the original, certainty, and extent of 
human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of 
belief, opinion, and assent; I shall not at present meddle with 
the physical consideration of the mind, or trouble myself to 
examine wherein its essence consists, or by what motions of 
our spirits, or alterations of our bodies, we came to have any 
sensations by our organs, or any ideas in our understandings ; 
and whether those ideas do, in their formation, any or all of 
them, depend on matter or no; these are speculations which, 
however curious or entertaining, I shail decline, as lying out 
of my way in the design I now am upon.” His problem, 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 Early Conceptionsrand Tests of Intelligence 
then, deals with knowledge primarily; but as the Essay 
became very influential, it not only became a text for study 
but it became the chief authority upon which were based 
numerous texts and courses of study in both Europe and 
America; and it is largely through the empirical movement 
into which Locke threw the weight of his influence, that sen- 
sations have been so heavily stressed in psychology. 
LOCKE REACTS AGAINST THE DOCTRINE OF INNATE IDEAS 
Locke, on empirical grounds, took the position first of all 
that we have no innate ideas, but that the mind begins a 
tabula rasa and must gain all its knowledge through the senses 
and through “the perception of the operations of our own 
minds within us, as it [the understanding] is employed about 
the ideas it has got” (181, page 235). This perception of 
one’s own mental operations Locke called “reflection.” 
‘he argument for certain “innate ideas,” that they are uni- 
versal among mankind, he meets upon purely empirical 
grounds by asserting that if they are innate they should 
appear “fairest and clearest in the minds of children, idiots, 
savages, and illiterate people who are of all the least cor- 
rupted by custom or borrowed opinions.” But just here he 
does not find these alleged innate ideas. 
He then proceeds to show in great detail just how our ideas, 
knowledge, beliefs, etc., actually originate. Into these de- 
tails we cannot enter. The feelings receive but little atten- 
tion, and it is obvious that they play a secondary réle for 
Locke. He rejects the idea of faculties, but calls the under- 
standing and the will ‘“‘powers or abilities of the mind.” 
He, however, pointed out the futility of attempting to 
explain the supposed freedom of the will by the assumption 
of a faculty of volition. For him this would be similar to 
explaining singing by ascribing it to a vocal faculty. Will for 
Locke was not a spontaneous force. He tried to substitute
-P-A-G-E-63
  Intelligence and Intellectual F S 49 
the term “power” (in the sense of ability) for “faculty,” but 
with poor success, and some of his writings have even given 
encouragement to the idea that training of a mental power or 
function in a certain way would give it general efficiency — 
the doctrine of formal discipline (147, pages 58 ff., and 159). 
THE ELEVATION OF THE UNDERSTANDING 
“Since it is the wnderstanding that sets man above the rest 
of sensible beings, and gives him all the advantages and 
dominion which he has over them, it is certainly a subject, 
even for its nobleness, worth our labor to inquire into” 
(Book 1, Chapter 1). We cannot follow up the various 
developments of Locke’s psychology, but must merely em- 
phasize the well-known fact, that down to the time of the 
biological movement represented in Darwin great stress 
was laid on “intellectual faculties,” with but s¢ant recogni- 
tion of individual differences. In these developments the 
“association of ideas,” a term that originated with Locke, 
came to play a leading réle. 
FACULTY PSYCHOLOGY AND ITS DISSOLUTION 
In the meantime there had developed in continental Europe 
after Leibnitz a movement headed by Christian von Wolff 
(1679-1754) which has been called faculty psychology, be- 
cause it was concerned chiefly with classifying the “faculties 
of the soul.” For Wolff “soul is not body nor an attribute 
communicated to the body.” It is a simple substance 
endowed with certain faculties or “potencies of action.” 
«The essence of the soul consists in its power of re-presenting 
the universe, which power is materially limited by its loca- 
tion in an organic body in the universe, and formally limited 
by the constitution of the sensory organs” (181, page 231), 
for its knowledge of the world is dependent upon the excita- 
tion of the senses.  
-P-A-G-E-64
‘onceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
The faculty psychology was an attempt to analyze con- 
scious experiences and then to find the elementary powers of 
which they were manifestations. To ascribe any mental 
activity to a faculty was, for Wolff and his followers, to 
explain it. 
We need not enumerate the various faculties of this school, 
but must point out that any ascription of a mental process 
to a faculty or power is itself an obstacle to its analysis and 
further understanding, for the mere giving of a name to it usu- 
ally satisfies our curiosity and saves us from further effort. 
The tendency thus to avoid explanation of mental processes 
is even yet very noticeable in current psychology textbooks. 
Beneke (1798-1854) tended to counteract faculty psychology 
by reducing the faculties to a practically infinite number of 
elementary processes, operating in all conceivable relation- 
ships and degrees (11, Chapter 2). “Observation teaches 
us that every degree of any one of these fundamental condi- 
      
tions can occur together with any degree of the others” 
(181, page 424). 
Phrenology was an empirical attempt, based on faculty 
psychology, to locate in the different parts of the brain the 
various mental faculties and powers; but it was found to 
have very little scientific basis in its finer details, and is now 
wholly discredited by reliable scientists. 
These early views of our intellectual functions, ascribing 
to them as a rule an other-worldness and a spontaneity or 
power not accounted for by ordinary life processes as affected 
by external stimulation, have had a great influence on modern 
conceptions of intelligence. Many persons today regard 
mind as some sort of arbitrary force which is not only not 
measurable, but which is so variable in any given individual 
that mental measurement at any one moment would throw 
either no light at all or only very little light at best on the 
behavior possibilities of that individual at subsequent periods.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
Intelligence and Intellectual Faculties 51 
Such people, in other words, do not see how human behavior 
- can be predictable, since it depends on the “‘will.”” With a 
thing that is arbitrary and self-moved in the sense that it is 
not conditioned by anything else in the universe, science can 
of course do nothing. In this view, still strongly represented 
in the popular mind, man is not really a part of the natural 
world, but an outsider; he comes endowed with a free will, 
with which he can at his own choice do good or evil. In 
times when such views prevailed among leaders man was 
cruel to the unfortunate victims of his passions and his selfish 
impulses. He regarded those who departed from the paths 
of rectitude as voluntarily choosing evil, and so he was ready 
to see them condemned to endless retributive punishment. 
In such an age scientific methods of studying human beha- 
vior could obviously be little appreciated. Any tendencies 
to depart from such views of arbitrariness in mental functions 
would doubtless be significant of scientific progress, even 
though it would take a long time for the appreciation of ex- 
perimental studies and for the development of reliable tests 
of intelligence. We shall in the next chapter turn our at- 
tention to a tendency that early developed in psychology and 
counteracted the views which would make man’s mental 
life a play of arbitrary forces.

Tue Errects or AssociaTIONIsM ON PRIMITIVE 
ConcEPTions OF INTELLIGENCE 
We have seen that our conceptions of intelligence have 
come down from early views of the soul as a spontaneous 
and unconditioned force; that the recognition of certain 
higher and lower mental processes led to assumptions of 
different souls and faculties; and that in modern times some 
of these processes were explained on purely mechanical 
principles while others continued, though not uninterruptedly, 
to be thought of as more or less distinct from material or 
physiological operations and as somehow possessing powers 
of their own. Examples of such mental powers or faculties | 
are “‘the understanding,”’ reason, consciousness, attention, 
constructive imagination, and will, several of which may 
still be found treated as powers in certain of our modern 
texts. 
THE LIMITATION OF “FREE” FACULTIES WAS 
EARLY RECOGNIZED 
Difficulties early arose with the conception of arbitrary 
powers ascribed to the soul and with certain faculties. Prob- 
ably every careful observer has noticed that what we feel, 
think, and do at any time has a tendency to influence our 
later feelings, thoughts, and actions, and that our lives are 
affected materially by our associations and physical surround- 
ings. We have already noted that Plato recognized in 
dreams not only the impulsions of desires but also of the 
effects of “strong motions” surviving from the stimuli of the 
previous day. He also points out in Phedo, though some- 
what casually, the effects of past experiences on our thoughts. 
The knowledge of a lyre is not the same as that of a man, 
52
-P-A-G-E-67
    
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 53 
“and yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a 
lyre, or a garment, or anything else that the beloved has 
been in the habit of using? Do not they, from knowing 
the lyre, form in the mind’s eye an image of the youth to 
whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection. In like 
manner any one who sees Simmias may remember Cebes ; 
and there are endless examples of the same thing . . . and 
from the picture of Simmias, you may be led to remember 
Cebes. .. . Or you may be led to a recollection of Sim- 
mias himself... . And in all these cases the recollection 
may be derived from things either like or unlike... . 
When we perceive something, either by the help of sight, or 
hearing, or some other sense, from that perception we are 
able to obtain a notion of some other thing like or unlike 
which is associated with it but has been forgotten” (175, 
pages 73-76). It is clear that these association processes 
would, if carried very far, limit considerably the freedom of 
the soul. 
This natural sequence of our thoughts did not escape the 
attention of Aristotle, who recognized that we recall past 
experiences on the basis of association. He said that be- 
cause of the fact that one experience naturally succeeds 
another, when we try to recollect something ‘“‘we keep stimu- 
lating certain earlier experiences until we have stimulated 
the one which the one in question is wont to succeed” (228, 
pages 25f.). In this way both with and without effort we call 
up past experiences. In this sequence of thought he recog- 
nizes both a necessary and a habitual connection, the latter 
greatly predominating. The principles of contiguity, simi- 
larity, and contrast, as stated in present-day texts, were 
clearly recognized by him. 
Various other writers before Descartes also recognized 
association either theoretically or practically, as in the prepar- 
ation of speeches. Klemm says that when we remember that
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
up to the time of Augustus (63 B.c.-14 a.p.) “no public 
speaker would dare to appear in public with even the scantiest 
notes, the interest in mnemotechnical devices is easily intel- 
ligible.”” Mental pictures were recommended in the time 
of Cicero as aids to memory. In order to have at one’s 
command large masses of ideas, one must localize them, 
say in a given city, and within the city in different buildings, 
chambers, etc. (147, page 91). Thus the soul is forced to 
use mechanism to accomplish its objects, but this use of 
mechanical means was not always a hindrance to the soul, 
for, as James has pointed out, habits may be made our serv- 
ants instead of our masters. Thus to Maximus of Tyre 
(2d century a.p.), who enumerated the different types of as- 
sociation, the following sentence is ascribed: “‘As a motion 
imparted to one end of a cord traverses the whole length of 
the cord, so the reason requires only a slight impulse in 
order to recall whole trains of ideas” (147, page 90; 186, 
page 310). 
LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE “PASSIONS” 
For the Stoics, as for Aristotle, reason was a controlling 
influence in the world and soul was the active principle in 
all animate creatures. Soul is the subtlest form of substance, 
and “pervades the whole organism of. the creature just as 
reason pervades the universe. . . . Mental activity as it is 
found in men is a developed and specialized form of the uni- 
versal reason” (74, page 164). The passions or emotions 
gave some degree of trouble. For Zeno (cir. 490-430) emo- | 
tions seem to have been regarded as an irrational or at least 
unnatural movement of the soul, an excess impulse; but as 
the individual attains a higher degree of reason these obscure 
inclinations or subconscious workings of reason become more 
explicit, and conscious ends of action are adopted. For later 
Stoics, however, the passions are diseases of reason (74,
-P-A-G-E-69
  
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 55 
pages 175 f.). They also seem to have recognized the limit- 
ing effects of past experiences on the influence of the soul. 
EARLY MECHANISTIC VIEWS OF BEHAVIOR 
Jean Buridan (1297-1358), the French rationalist who 
studied under William of Occam, recognized the mechanistic 
factors in behavior to the extent that he has been called the 
Herbartian among the Scholastics. He denied the freedom 
of the will as a special power in addition to the intellect ; 
the two are but activities of the soul. After a judgment as 
to an object or situation there follows pleasure or displeasure, 
which stimulates the will. The only “freedom” that he 
admits is a certain power of the intellect, or of the will, to 
keep motives before the intellect long enough for it to get 
a view of the circumstances — to apprehend the situation. 
The will is entirely dependent on this view. The comparison 
of the will, tied between two equally balanced motives, to a 
donkey dying of hunger between two equidistant bundles of 
hay of equal size, ascribed to him, is probably an invention 
of his opponents in ridicule of his determinism. It is not 
found in his works (81, and 147, page 365). 
DESCARTES FORCED TO A DUALISTIC EXPLANATION 
OF BEHAVIOR 
Descartes, though emphasizing the freedom and spon- 
taneity of the soul, resorted to a very mechanical illustration 
of how it probably affects and controls action in man. “It is, 
also, necessary to know that, although the soul is joined to 
the entire body, there is, nevertheless, a certain part of the 
body in which it exercises its functions more particularly 
than in all the rest; and it is commonly thought that this 
part is the brain, or, perhaps, the heart: the brain, because 
to it the organs of sense are related; and the heart, because 
it is as if there the passions are felt. But, after careful ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    56 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
amination, it seems to me quite evident that the part of the 
body in which the soul immediately exercises its functions 
is neither the heart, nor even the brain as a whole, but solely 
the most interior part of it, which is a certain very small 
gland [the pineal gland], situated in the middle of its sub- 
stance, and so suspended above the passage by which the 
spirits of its anterior cavities communicate with those of 
the posterior, that the slightest motions in it may greatly 
affect the course of these spirits, and, reciprocally, that the 
slightest change which takes place in the course of the spirits 
may greatly affect the motions of this gland” (181, pages 173 
f.). This seat of operation of the soul was chosen by him 
because “other parts of the brain are all double,” and there 
must necessarily be some place where the two images from 
the eyes or the two impressions from the ears “may unite 
in one before they reach the mind, in order that they may 
not present to it two objects in place of one”; also because 
only at this point is there, he supposed, a confluence “of the 
spirits which fill the cavities of the brain.” 
The will has the actions “absolutely in its power” and to 
effect any action needs only incline the gland so as to bring 
this about. But motions of the spirits coming from the body 
or from strong external excitations may affect the gland and 
thus bring about the disturbances known to Descartes 
as passions, nearly the same as is implied in our word 
“emotions.” 
BEGINNINGS OF ASSOCIATIONISM 
Descartes also noted that the mind may be aided by habits. 
Thus when it wills to recall anything, “this volition causes 
the gland, by inclining successively to different sides, to im- 
pel the spirits toward different parts of the brain until they 
come upon that where the traces are left of the thing it wills 
to remember; for these traces are due to nothing else than
-P-A-G-E-71
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 57 
the circumstance that the pores of the brain, through which 
the spirits have already taken their course, on presentation 
of that object, have thereby acquired a greater facility than 
the rest to be opened again in the same way by the spirits 
which come to them; so that these spirits coming upon these 
pores, enter therein more readily than into the others, by 
which means they excite a particular motion in the gland, 
which represents to the mind the same object, and causes 
it to recognize that it is that which it willed to remember” 
(181, pages 177 f.). In the Traité de Vhomme he makes a 
similar statement, and then continues: “And also it must 
be noticed that if we open only certain ones... this of itself 
may be the cause of others. . . reopening also at the same time, 
especially if they had all been opened together several times 
and had not been used to being so one without the others. 
This shows how the recollection of one thing may be excited 
by that of another which was formerly impressed upon the 
| memory at the same time as it” (228, page 32). Warren 
points out that Descartes held also that an experience will 
call up another that partly resembles it, and that he compares 
the effect of past experience on the brain with that seen on 
paper or cloth which has once been folded and is therefore 
more fit to be folded in the same place again. Descartes 
thus clearly recognizes associative connections between 
brain processes themselves rather than merely between 
mental experiences. 
For Hobbes, as we have seen, all knowledge comes from 
sensory experiences. “There is no conception in a man’s mind 
which hath not first, totally or by parts, been begotten upon 
the organs of sense” (130, Chapter 1). Thus all imagina- 
tions and even dreams are limited. ‘Whatever we imagine 
is finite,” the infinite being incomprehensible (Chapter 3). 
Moreover, past experiences can give us no absolute guaran- 
tee of future happenings; ‘for though a man has always 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
58 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
seen the day and night to follow one another hitherto; yet 
can he not thence conclude they shall do so, or that they have 
done so eternally: experience concludeth nothing universally” 
(131, Chapter 4, and 181, page 159). 
Though thus thoroughly empirical, he did not come upon 
the full significance of association as a principle in the control 
of our experiences, directive “cognitive powers’’ being sti 
a good deal in evidence, even though based, as to content, 
on sensations. In his dealing with trains of imagination we 
find, however, clear recognition of both contiguity and_simi- 
larity association, the first being ‘“‘unguided, without design, 
and inconstant; wherein there is no passionate thought to 
govern and direct” the thoughts or ideas that follow. So 
“the thoughts are said to wander, and seem impertinent one 
to another, asin adream. ... And yet in this wild rang- 
ing of the mind, a man may oftimes perceive the way of it, 
and the dependence of one thought upon another.” ... 
“The second is more constant, as being regulated by some 
desire and design. ... From desire, ariseth the thought 
of some means we have seen produce the like of that which we 
aim at; and from the thought of that, the thought of means 
to that means; and so continually till we come to some be- 
ginning within our own power.” But such trains of thought 
have their physical basis, and one’s “next thought after [any 
one] is not altogether so casual as it seems to be... . 
All fancies are motions within us, relics of those made in the 
sense; and those motions that immediately succeeded one 
another in the sense continue also together after sense; 
insomuch that the former coming again to take place and be 
predominant, the latter followeth, by coherencé of the matter 
moved, in such a manner as water upon a plane table is 
drawn which way any one part of it is guided by the finger” 
(130, Chapter 3). If he had been entirely consistent he 
would not have stopped, after such a beginning, until he had
-P-A-G-E-73
  Associationism and Primitwe Conceptions 59 
involved all the mental processes; but this was too great a 
step to be taken at once. i 
Locke did not recognize association as an important prin- 
ciple in the succession of ideas, even though we owe to him 
the expression, “the association of ideas.” This is probably 
due to his use of reflection, reason, etc., as though they were 
arbitrary forces which act upon the ideas, once the latter have 
been acquired. He recognized. ‘“‘a natural correspondence 
and connection” among ideas, which “‘it is the office and ex- 
cellency of our reason to trace,” and also “another connection 
of ideas wholly owing to chance or custom; ideas that in 
themselves are not at all of kin, come to be so united in some 
men’s minds that it is very hard to separate them; they 
always keep in company, and the one no sooner at any time 
comes into the understanding but its associate appears with 
it.” These connections of ideas which are not of kin, may 
originally be due either to will or to chance, so that in- 
dividuals in time become very different. He then makes 
a statement, now classic, as to the cause of such connections : 
“Custom settles habits of thinking in the understanding, as 
well as of determining in the will, and of motions in the body ; 
all which seem to be but trains of motion in the animal 
spirits, which, once set a-going, continue in the same steps 
they have been used to, which, by often treading, are worn 
into a smooth path, and the motion in it becomes easy, and 
as it were natural” (158, Chapter 33). Unfortunately he does 
not carry out far the implications of this view. This was 
left for his successors, Hume and Hartley, especially the 
latter. : 
Berkeley (1685-1753), Bishop of Cloyne, whom we must 
mention before passing to Hume, used the term “suggestion” 
instead of “association.” In his well-known Essay towards 
a New Theory of Vision (12) he held that the distance of ob- 
jects cannot be and is not directly perceived, but “is suggested
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
to the mind by the mediation of some other idea, which is 
itself perceived in the act of seeing.” An example of what he 
means may clarify his conception. Suppose you see a tree 
in the distance. Now what you really see is not directly dis- 
tance but a “visible appearance” or an object of a certain 
magnitude, a certain “confusion or distinctness,” a certain 
intensity of colors, of brightness differences, etc., and you 
notice that some other objects intervening cover part of the 
tree or obstruct your vision of it while farther objects are 
covered in part by the tree; moreover, you have certain 
strains in the muscles of accommodation and of convergence 
(of which you may easily become conscious by attention to 
them). So there are various intervening “ideas” (sensa- 
tions and images) which vary in a number of respects with 
the distance of the object seen. These “‘suggest” to you 
immediately how far the tree is away; that is, they suggest 
that after having walked, say, so many steps and moved 
around certain intervening objects you can receive touch 
experiences of, or contact with, the tree. Distance for Berke- 
ley is really only the amount of such intervening experiences 
that will take place before you can touch or handle the 
object perceived. “‘I believe,” he says, “whoever will look 
narrowly into his own thoughts [i.e., carefully analyze his own 
experiences], and examine what he means by saying he sees 
this or that thing at a distance, will agree with me, that what 
he sees only suggests to his understanding that, after having 
passed a certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his 
body, which is perceivable by touch, he shall come to perceive 
such and such tangible ideas, which have been usually con- 
nected with such and such visible ideas” (181, page 265). 
Berkeley (13) denies the existence of external objects as 
things other than what we experience them to be, and he 
attributes these experiences directly to Deity; but for him 
suggestion, or habit connections among experiences, plays  
-P-A-G-E-75
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 61 
-alarge réle. There is no necessary connection between these 
“ideas” and the visible objects they suggest. “All which visi- 
ble objects are only in the mind; nor do they suggest aught 
external, whether distance or magnitude, otherwise than by 
habitual connection, as words do things” (181, page 271). 
EXPLANATIONS OF BEHAVIOR BY THE ASSUMPTION OF 
FACULTIES IS CHALLENGED BY HUME 
Berkeley’s position had its effect on Hume (1711-1776), 
who carried it out further and greatly influenced the thought 
of his time. For Hume (136) all causality becomes only a 
succession of contiguous events, that which we call the cause 
always going before the effect. “Having thus discovered 
or supposed the two relations of contiguity and succession to 
be essential to causes and effects, I find I am stopt short, and 
can proceed no farther in considering any single instance of 
cause and effect” (181, page 301). It is obvious that this 
doctrine if applied rigorously to mental operations would 
do away with spontaneous faculties and original powers of 
the soul, as well as raise serious problems in philosophy which 
lie outside our present interest. As to mental powers, 
Hume says in another connection (137): “It may be said 
that we are every moment conscious of internal power; while 
we feel that, by the simple command of our will, we can move 
the organs of our body, or direct the faculties of our mind. 
An act of volition produces motion in our limbs, or raises 
a new idea in our imagination. This influence of the will 
we know by consciousness. Hence we acquire the idea of 
power or energy; and are certain, that we ourselves and all 
other intelligent beings are possessed of power. ... We 
shall proceed to examine this pretension. . . . The motion 
of our body follows upon the command of our will. Of this 
we are every moment conscious,” and in the preceding sen- 
tence, here omitted, he admits this command of the will to
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
be a fact. ‘‘But the means by which it is effected; the en- 
ergy by which the will performs so extraordinary an opera- 
tion; of this we are so far from being immediately conscious, 
that it must forever escape our most diligent enquiry” (180, 
page 330). 
He points out that we cannot move all the organs of the 
body in this way; e.g., the tongue and fingers are thus con- 
trolled but not the heart and liver. Moreover, anatomy 
shows “that the immediate object of power in voluntary 
motion, is not the member itself which is moved, but certain 
muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits, and, perhaps, some- 
thing still more minute and more unknown” (180, page 331). 
Thus we are ignorant both of the means of control and of 
any controlling agency. And if the soul is supposed to pro- 
duce this power of will we are reminded that this “is a real 
creation; a production of something out of nothing; which 
implies a power so great, that it may be seen, at first sight, 
beyond the reach of any being less than the infinite. At 
least it must be owned,’ that such a power is not felt, nor 
known, nor even conceivable by the mind.’’ Moreover, 
Hume points out that this “self-command is very different 
at different times. A man in health possesses more of it 
than one languishing with sickness. We are more masters 
of our thought in the morning than in the evening; fasting, 
than after a full meal. Can we give any reason for these 
variations, except experience? Where then is the power, of 
which we pretend to be conscious? Is there not here, either 
in a spiritual or material substance, or both, some secret 
mechanism or structure of parts, upon which the effect 
depends?” (180, page 333). Here is a remarkable passage 
in which Hume suggests rather clearly a mechanistic basis 
even of acts of will. 
In the Treatise where he is discussing “the connection or 
association of ideas” he comes definitely to some controlling 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 63 
principle even in as free a thing as the imagination. “As 
all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, and 
may be united again in what form it pleases, nothing would 
be more unaccountable than the operations of that faculty, 
were it not guided by some universal principles, which render 
it, in some measure, uniform with itself in all times and places. 
Were ideas entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone 
would join them; and ’tis impossible the same simple ideas 
should fall regularly into complex ones (as they commonly 
do) without some bond of union among them, some associat- 
ing quality, by which one idea naturally introduces another. 
This uniting principle among ideas is not to be considered 
as an inseparable connection; for that has been already 
excluded from the imagination: nor yet are we to conclude, 
that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing 
is more free than that faculty:! but we are only to regard 
it as a gentle force which commonly prevails. ... The 
qualities, from which this association arises, and by which 
the mind is after this manner conveyed from one idea to 
another, are three; viz., Resemblance, Contiguity in time or 
place, and Cause and Effect” * (181, pages 287 f.). 
Though usually concerned only with connections among 
ideas, Hume says also in the Treatise, “there is an attraction 
or association among impressions as well as among ideas; 
though with this remarkable difference, that ideas are asso- 
ciated by resemblance, contiguity, and causation, and im- 
pressions only by resemblance” (228, page 45). 
1 The passage quoted above from The Enquiry, which was published some 
years after this sentence appeared, is probably not considered a contradic- 
tion to this statement, for there he wrote also: ‘Nothing is more free than 
the imagination of man; and though it cannot exceed that original stock of 
ideas furnished by the internal and external senses, it has unlimited power 
of mixing, compounding, separating, and dividing these ideas.” Quoted by 
Warren, op. cit., page 45. 
2 Hume seems to have been ignorant of Aristotle’s classification of the 
laws of association. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ASSOCIATION SUGGESTED AS A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE SIMILAR 
TO ATTRACTION 
After some paragraphs of elaboration on these laws he 
makes this general statement as to the importance of associa- 
tion in the mental life: “These are therefore the principles 
of union or cohesion among our simple ideas, and in the imag- 
ination [they] supply the place of that inseparable connection, 
by which they [the ideas] are united in our memory. Here 
is a kind of attraction, which in the mental world will be found 
to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to 
show itself in as many and as various forms. Its effects are 
everywhere conspicuous; but as to its causes, they are mostly 
unknown, and must be resolved into original qualities of 
human nature, which I pretend not to explain” (181, pages 
989 f.). 
Thus Hume put up squarely the proposition of explaining 
mental processes in terms of certain laws of connection be- 
tween their different units, rather than in terms of souls or 
faculties or mental powers, which as explanatory means he 
rejects. His service in thus putting psychology into the 
same position in this respect as the physical sciences is 
doubtless very great, even though he did not introduce the 
experimental method. If this view is carried out to its 
logical implications, the spontaneity of the soul and of mental 
faculties as arbitrary, indeterminate powers, affecting be- 
havior and thought, comes to an end, so far as empirical, 
science is concerned, and the way is open to observation 
and experiment. It was the work of Hartley to carry out} 
this position further, but the day of experimental psychology 
was yet not so near. 
      
   
            
             HARTLEY A THOROUGHGOING ASSOCIATIONIST 
In the preface of Observations on Man, published in 1749, 
we find that Hume was not the one who suggested the prob:
-P-A-G-E-79
  
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 65 
lem of the importance of association in psychology to Hartley, 
but that the same empirical tendency influenced both these 
writers. In the preface of this work Hartley says: ‘“‘About 
eighteen years ago [1731, or eight years before the Treatise 
appeared] I was informed that the Reverend Mr. Gay, then 
living, asserted the possibility of deducing all our intellectual 
pleasures and pains from association. This put me upon con- 
sidering the power of association.”’! Gay in turn acknowledges 
his indebtedness to Newton and to Locke for the doctrines 
of vibration and association, respectively. 
     
   
             
     
         
    
      
    
     
    BEHAVIOR EXPLAINED ON GROSSLY MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES 
Hartley is the first writer to attempt an explanation of all 
forms of mental activity on the basis of association — that 
is, on a mechanistic basis (127). He accepts the Newtonian 
principle of molecular vibration, and applies it to the physio- 
logical processes, which he believed are subject to investiga- 
tion “in the same manner as the other parts of the external 
material world.” Thus the external vibrations set in motion 
the “white medullary substance of the brain,” with which 
lsensations and ideas, the elements of the mental life, are im- 
mediately associated, ‘“‘in other words, whatever changes are 
made, corresponding changes are made in our ideas; and 
ice versa.” ? The sensations, resulting from vibrations 
f the medullary substance of the brain, remain in the mind a 
hort time after the sensible objects exciting the nerves are 
emoved; moreover, sensations which have been often re-

and, The Classical Psychologists, page 313, who asserts that the internal 
vidence also shows that the anonymous tract, An Inquiry into the Origin of 
‘uman Appetites and Affections, Showing How Each Arises from Association, 
‘747, was written by Gay. 
2 Observations on Man, Chapter 1, Section 1, Prop. 2. His method is to 
tate propositions, as did Spinoza, and then to give evidence for each one 
immediately after the statement. All the propositions were printed in 
lics.
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
peated leave certain vestiges, types, or images of themselves, 
which he calls simple ideas of sensations (Props. 3 and 8). 
Of these ideas the most vivid are those whose corresponding 
sensations were most vividly or perfectly impressed. 
Sensations, he held, may be associated together either when 
their impressions are made in the same instant of time (syn- 
chronous association) or in immediately successive instants 
(successive association). Now, any sensations may, by oc- 
curring together a sufficient number of times, become so 
closely associated that the impression of any one sensation 
alone is able to excite in the mind the ideas which have habit- 
ually followed or accompanied it; likewise grosser external 
vibrations may revive the miniature vibrations which immedi- 
ately condition sensations. Thus an external object may 
arouse any succession of ideas which have been previously 
associated with it, the succession aroused depending on such 
factors as vividness, or intensity, and frequency of associa- 
tion. The influence of association therefore becomes very 
great, and “all that has been delivered by the ancients and 
moderns, concerning the power of habit, custom, example, 
education, authority, party-prejudice, the manner of learn- 
ing the manual and liberal arts, etc., goes upon this doctrine 
as its foundation, and may be considered as the detail of it, 
in various circumstances.” ! But associations can go only 
forward, not in the reverse order of their original occurrence. 
On these principles Hartley proceeds to show in detail 
how simple ideas run into higher complex mental processes, 
      
                      
         
   
    THE QUESTION OF MORAL FREEDOM 
“One of the principal objections to the opinion of mechan- 
ism,” says Hartley, “is that deduced from the existence o! 
the moral sense.”’ He also recognizes the difficulty regardin, 
freedom. “But it appears [from his own account give: 
1 From discussion of Prop. 10.
-P-A-G-E-81
  Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 67 
previous to this statement] . . . that God has so formed the 
world, and perhaps (with reverence be it spoken) was obliged 
by his moral perfections so to form it, as that virtue must 
have amiable and pleasing ideas affixed to it; vice, odious 
ones. The moral sense is therefore generated necessarily and 
mechanically” (127, page 504). Pleasure and pain are thus 
innately provided for as motives to action, and the founda- 
tion for will, based on association, is laid. Hartley believed 
that man’s conduct is little affected by this mechanistic 
view; “that the affections of gratitude and resentment, 
which are intimately connected with the moral sense, re- 
main notwithstanding the doctrine of mechanism.”’ “When 
a person first changes his opinion from free-will to mechanism, 
or more properly first sees part of the mechanism of the mind, 
and believes the rest from analogy, he is just as much 
affected by his wonted pleasures and pains, hopes and fears, 
as before, by the moral and religious ones, as by others” 
(page 505). Indeed, Hartley’s own life is an example of his 
doctrine; he was active in his profession as a physician and 
has been described as ‘“‘a noble and philanthropic man.” 
Part II of his Observations on Man is concerned with ethics 
and theology. 
FACULTIES AS ARBITRARY POWERS RULED OUT 
Thus Hartley builds up an extremely mechanical view of 
the individual as a passive agent whose conduct is determined 
by the order and intensity of stimulation of external objects. 
He does not recognize the law of association by similarity, 
but bases all on contiguity. It is but a natural consequence 
of this that he should so completely neglect the treatment 
of the reconstructive process called “reasoning.” This 
seriously limits his psychology, and may be said to be a 
characteristic limitation of associationism. Milder associa- 
tionists have usually introduced, explicitly or otherwise, 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  68 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
certain faculties, such as reason or intelligence or a “spiritual 
force”’ to supplement the principles of association. Hartley, 
though a self-acknowledged disciple of Locke, consistently 
rejected Locke’s “reflection”’ as a source of ideas, this being 
in his own words “an unknown quantity ” with which nothing 
can be done.! While he recognizes in his Introduction the 
“faculties” of memory, imagination or fancy, understanding, 
affectation, and will, these are really only conscious aspects of 
processes driven by stimuli and association, not forces. 
Hartley distinguishes between automatic acts, so called “from 
their resemblance to the motions of automata, or machines, 
whose principle of motion is within themselves,” and volun- 
tary acts, “which arise from ideas and affectations, and which 
therefore are referred to the mind.” It is the state of mind 
immediately preceding these voluntary actions that he calls 
will, and this state is for him determined from sense impres- 
sions by the laws of association. 
TWO CONDITIONS DETERMINING BEHAVIOR ACCORDING 
TO HARTLEY 
Our actions are thus determined by two general conditions : 
(1) heredity or innate structure, conditioning more directly 
the automatic acts, and, as we have seen, tendencies to feel 
actions leading to favorable results as pleasant, and those 
leading to harmful results as unpleasant or painful, and 
(2) impressions by, or stimulations of, things in the external 
world, their intensity and their frequency of stimulation 
being most important. Will and our deliberately chosen 
acts are but natural outcomes of these conditions, and the 
faculties mentioned above seem to be only the subjective 
aspects of the various “motions” thus brought about. This 
1 Peter Browne, taking literally the simile of the tabula rasa, had already 
rejected Locke’s reflection as a source of ideas, and Condillac, soon after 
Hartley, also rejected it. See Dessoir, op. cit., page 117.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 69 
view resembles closely the conceptions of certain modern 
authorities, and it is obviously favorable to intelligence test- 
ing if hereditary differences are stressed. 
Hartley did not work out causal relationships between 
body and mind but rested his views on the simple assumption 
that vibrations of the ‘“‘white medullary substance of the 
brain” is immediately and directly accompanied by corre- 
sponding states of consciousness. He asserted explicitly at 
the end of the first volume that his mechanistic view did 
not prejudice one way or the other the question of the sur- 
vival of personal consciousness after death. 
LATER DEVELOPMENTS IN ASSOCIATIONISM 
The lack of space forbids us to follow out further the vari- 
ous lines of later development in associationism as a 
mechanistic interpretation of our mental processes and our 
behavior. We can only refer the reader to this interesting 
development in psychology,! and say that in James Mill 
(1773-1836) associationism reached its most extreme state- 
ment. He attempted to analyze the complex forms of mental 
life into their ultimate constituents (ideas derived at first from 
sensations) and then to show how by the laws of synchro- 
nous and successive association by contiguity all the complex 
forms might result. Once he is beyond the sensations, he 
derives very little aid from physiology but gives his psychol- 
ogy chiefly a logical basis. He accepted, as did Hartley, 
pleasurable and painful sensations, and he emphasized fre- 
quency or repetition, vividness, and recency as the important 
1See especially the writings of Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), Thomas 
Brown (1778-1820), James and J. S. Mill (1806-1873), Etienne Bonnet de 
Condillac (1715-1780), Julien Offray de La Mattrie (1709-1751), Charles 
Bonnet (1720-1793), Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (1757-1808), Johan 
Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841), Alexander Bain (1818-1903), William James 
(1842-1910). Warren’s A History of the Association Psychology gives an 
account of the development and limitations of associationism. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
70 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
factors in association. Thus for him the order and intensity 
of stimulation, rather than the general consistency of the 
external and the internal or bodily conditions, determine 
conduct. The result was that associationism gave a too 
passive, receptive, and mechanical view of the individual 
to secure the general assent of psychologists, a view that 
has consequently undergone numerous modifications. The 
general conception of association is, however, still utilized 
extensively in current psychological literature, and attempts 
to revive this doctrine in a thoroughly physiological setting 
have been made. 
BIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
NEGLECTED 
Mill’s work was more influential than Hartley’s. His 
famous Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829) 
occupies a place of very great importance in the history of 
psychology, and was edited and annotated by his son, John 
Stuart Mill, together with Alexander Bain and others, in 1869. 
The older Mill’s views were subjected to important modifi- 
cations by these later writers and they were given broad appli- 
cations to social and economic problems, particularly in the 
utilitarian doctrine of John Stuart Mill and his followers. 
The associationism of James Mill was, however, inclined 
to neglect innate factors and therefore individual differences, 
and it was essentially a logical and not an empirical study of 
the intelligence of man. From such an approach little 
could be expected in the way of tests of the larger human 
traits and abilities. From associationism little more could 
be looked for in the way of tests than attempts to measure 
the senses of different individuals — the supposed avenues 
of their knowledge and motives to action — and possibly 
the speed of various associative processes, even though this 
philosophy contributed very much to the understanding of
-P-A-G-E-85
  Associationism and Primitive Conceptions 71 
certain aspects of the operations of our minds. Association- 
ism is closely connected with the sensory experimental psy- 
chology that was early developed in Germany under the 
influence of men like Weber (1795-1878), Fechner (1801— 
1887), Helmholtz (1821-1894), and Wundt (1832-1921), 
whose works have contributed very little to intelligence 
testing as now understood. Galton was also much in- 
fluenced by the associationist philosophy, but he at the 
same time represents a marked biological interest then tak- 
ing hold of the leaders of scientific thought in England. It 
was this combination of intellectual influences, as we shall 
see in the chapter that follows, which was to bring about the 
beginnings of intelligence testing.

  CHAPTER FIVE 
Earty Tests or INTELLIGENCE 
THE INFLUENCE OF BIOLOGY ON ASSOCIATIONISM 
One of the defects of the association movement in early 
psychology was its emphasis on ideas as units of the complex 
mental operations. While it displaced souls and faculties, 
in the form of original forces, it became so much occupied 
with ideas, which came to be considered somewhat as dis- 
crete entities, that the individual tended to sink into the 
background. It also— more in Mill’s than in Hartley’s 
work — tended to emphasize sensations to the exclusion of 
innate reaction tendencies; so while in one sense psychology 
was forced from the useless enumeration of faculties, it 
nevertheless did not become emancipated from merely logical 
analysis, as distinct from observation and experiment. 
Bain, who was really the last of the so-called pure associa- 
tionists, grounded his psychology on a physiology that was a 
great advance over that of the early associationists, and he 
semphasized individual differences in general retentiveness 
“specific to each person,” in bodily strength, in “spon- 
taneity or the active temperament,” in muscular delicacy, 
and in the sort of constructiveness that employs similarity 
association. But he was little influenced by the evolutionary 
movement and gave scant attention to empirical methods 
of investigation, although numerous expressions of this sort 
might well have given encouragement to experimentation 
and testing: “We find a great inequality in the progress of 
learners placed almost exactly in the same circumstances. 
Sometimes the difference refers only to single departments, 
as mechanical art, music, or language; it is then referable to 
special and local endowments, as muscular sensibility, the 
* musical ear, and so forth. Often, however, the superiority 
of individuals is seen in acquirement as a whole, in which 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  Early Tests of Intelligence Me 
form it is better regarded as a general power of retentiveness” 
(8, Chapter 1, III). But these suggestions as to the measur- 
able differences in individuals were not yet put to the test 
of experimental methods, and Bain’s important books, the 
one from which we have quoted and the second volume, The 
Emotions and the Will, published four years later, in 1859, soon 
became overshadowed by the evolutionary hypothesis of 
Darwin, published in the same year as the second volume. 
While later revisions show the effect of the biological move- 
ment, Bain clearly belongs to the preévolutionary period. 
The general effect of the subsequent developments in the 
biological sciences has undoubtedly been to operate against 
the association conception of ideas and to place the emphasis 
on the individual as a unit. One of the chief influences 
toward this fortunate change of emphasis was doubtless the 
studies of animal behavior, studies beginning to take a 
definitely experimental turn just shortly before the close of 
the last century. In these studies it early became evident 
that the principles of the associationists were inadequate to 
account for the elimination of erroneous movements in, 
learning processes, and that the entire animal was the real 
unit, whatever differentiations in particular kinds of responses 
it manifested. But while these were mainly studies in learn- 
ing, investigations along another line had for some time been 
in progress. 
GALTON’S STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
The genius of ‘Francis Galton (1822-1911) was occupied 
largely with investigations of individual differences. In 
1869 he published his well-known Hereditary Genius; and 
his Inquiries into Human Faculty, which brought together 
in a condensed and reorganized form numerous memoirs 
published before that date, appeared in 1883. In the Intro- 
duction of this latter book he says: “My general object has
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
been to take note of the varied hereditary faculties of different 
men, and of the great differences in different families and 
races, to learn how far history may have shown the prac- 
ticability of supplanting inefficient human stock by better 
strains, and to consider whether it might not be our duty to 
do so by such efforts as may be reasonable, thus exerting 
ourselves to further the ends of evolution more rapidly and 
with less distress than if events were left to their own course.” 
This general plan of his work as outlined by himself shows 
how thoroughly the new developments in biological evolu- 
tion had gripped him. But the influence of the older pre- 
evolutionary psychology of sensations and ideas continued 
to be very great for some decades, and even Galton, with 
‘so thoroughly biological interests, shows unmistakably the 
effect of it. But his originality in the attack on the larger 
human nature problems is nevertheless refreshing. “The 
instincts and faculties of different men and races,”’ he con- 
tinues, “differ in a variety of ways almost as profoundly as 
those of animals in different cages of the zodlogical gardens ; 
and however diverse and antagonistic they are each may be 
good of its kind.” 
His broad interest in animals and in the development of 
human races gave him, fortunately, an objective point of 
view which was favorable to the measurement of their 
differences, and while his studies of the physical features of 
man were but a means to his main purpose, they nevertheless 
served to compel objective, scientific methods. He says: 
“Tt is with the innate moral and intellectual faculties that 
this book is chiefly concerned, but they are so closely bound 
up with the physical ones that these must be considered as 
well” (ibid.). He was influential through an anthropometric 
committee of the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science, established in 1878, in inducing “several institu- 
tions, such as Marlborough College, to undertake a regular
-P-A-G-E-89
  Early Tests of Intelligence 75 
system of anthropometric record,” and in 1882 he established 
his famous laboratory in South Kensington Museum, London. 
“There, by the payment of a small fee, individuals could go 
and have certain physical measurements made and undergo 
tests of keenness of vision and hearing, dynamometer pres- 
sure, reaction time, etc.” (86, page 1). 
Galton regarded energy, ‘“‘the capacity for labor,” as the 
most important quality to favor in any scheme of eugenics, 
since it “‘is eminently transmissible by descent,” and since 
his previous studies had shown “that leaders of scientific 
thought were generally gifted with remarkable energy” 
(115, pages 25, 27); but the influence of the Lockian school 
of psychology is evident when Galton says: “The only in-~ 
formation that reaches us concerning outward events appears 
to. pass through the avenue of our senses; and the more 
perceptive the senses are of difference, the larger is the field 
upon which our judgment and intelligence can act” (ibid.). 
GALTON’S SENSORY TESTS OF INTELLIGENCE 
From observations to the effect that the discriminative 
capacity of idiots for heat, cold, and pain is very obtuse, and 
from the tests that he had thus far made on the sensitivity 
of different persons, he supposed that this sensory discrimi- 
native capacity “would on the whole be highest among the 
intellectually ablest” (page 29). He therefore devised a 
system of weights, even yet in use in psychological labora- 
tories, arranged in a geometrical series, for testing the 
delicacy of weight discrimination in different individuals. 
These weights were based on Weber’s law “that when stimuli 
of all kinds increase by geometric grades the sensations they 
give rise to will increase by arithmetic grades” (page 34). 
He also suggested devices for similar tests of other senses. 
Thus he very definitely assumed at this early date the es- 
sentials of the theory of mental tests, and he worked out
-P-A-G-E-90
76 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
actual quantitative tests of intelligence, based on this view. 
The theory that certain measurable abilities correlate with 
intelligence and can be used to predict in a measure one’s 
degree of intelligence, is clearly implied; and Galton also rec- 
ognized that the validity of a test of this kind is determined by 
its degree of correlation with a reliable criterion, for he chose 
persons of extreme differences in general mental ability to see 
whether they also differed correspondingly in sensory dis- 
crimination. It is, of course, true that the particular sort 
of test chosen has since been found to have little validity for 
persons who are within the limits of normality, but the essen- 
tial procedure for the discovery of more valuable tests was 
clearly in mind. Unfortunately, Galton did not continue to 
follow up this good beginning in mental testing, but was 
diverted by other problems. 
TESTS OF SENSITIVITY TO HIGH TONES 
Galton also devised the well-known Galton whistle for 
testing the upper range of sensibility to high tones, and he 
carried out interesting experiments both on various animals 
at zodlogical gardens — with the smull whistle concealed in 
the end of his walking stick — and on persons of various 
ages. Among animals, cats were found most sensitive to 
high tones, and, as to humans, it was discovered that elderly 
persons were very greatly limited in their upper range of 
hearing as compared with younger ones, the former commonly 
betraying “‘much dislike to the discovery” (page 39). 
VARIOUS OTHER TRAITS INVESTIGATED 
There seems to be no evidence that he regarded this 
auditory pitch test as having value for intelligence measure- 
ment; neither is it made very clear in his writing just what 
qualities, aside from great energy, are supposed to con- 
tribute directly to superior intelligence. He, however, used
-P-A-G-E-91
  
Early Tests of Intelligence i 
thoroughly empirical methods in the study of various char- 
acter traits, a subject to which we are now in psychology 
beginning to pay attention as supplementary to intelligence 
determinations. He noted certain sex differences, such as 
coyness in the female. “The willy-nilly disposition of the 
female in matters of love is as apparent in the butterfly as i n 
the man, and must have been continuously favored from the 
earliest stages of animal evolution” (page 57). Since natural 
character and temperament traits are difficult to estimate in 
adults, owing to their tendency to conceal undesirable traits, 
he resorted for the evaluation of different traits to the opinion 
of teachers who have opportunities of observing young school 
children. “The replies have differed, but those on which 
most stress was laid [by the teachers] were connected with 
energy, sociability, desire to attract notice, truthfulness, 
thoroughness, and refinement” (page 58). It is impossible 
now to say how much these replies of the teachers were 
influenced by the manner in which the questions were put 
to them. Galton himself also noted, both in persons and in 
animals, wide and striking differences in emotional constitu- 
tion and in likings and antipathies. 
Galton also made interesting studies of various mental 
differences in imagery, devising a mental imagery test that \_ 
was formerly much used in experimental psychology ; but his 
greatest service to intelligence testing is doubtless the Kee 
of developing various mathematical methods of handlin; 
data statistically. Among these methods, which we can- 
not here consider, are the use of standard measures and the 
correlation method, the former being a means of representin; gs 
all scores in similar and directly comparable units — units 
of the standard deviation of the distribution! The method

78 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
of correlation, which in its fundamental properties was dis- 
covered and presented graphically by Galton from 1877 to 
1888 (145, page 152), is now so well known and so extensively 
used as to need no comment here. 
CATTELL INTRODUCES THE TERM “MENTAL TESTS” 
The now familiar term “mental tests” seems to have been 
first used by Cattell, who as early as 1890 published an article 
entitled “Mental Tests and Measurements” (87), describing 
tests then actually in use in his own laboratory in the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania. To this article Galton appended a 
remark suggesting the desirability of comparing such labo- 
ratory measures, to use his own words, with “an independent 
estimate of the man’s powers. . . . The sort I would suggest 
is something of this kind, — ‘mobile, eager, energetic; 
well shaped; successful at games requiring good eye and 
hand; sensitive; good at music and drawing’ ” (198, page 
206). Cattell in the tests he was using had followed Galton 
in combining physical with mental tests, but he went farther 
‘in regard to method than Galton had done and emphasized 
the necessity of standardization of the procedure in the 
\ administration of the tests in order to secure strictly com- 
parable results. Cattell’s tests, some of which seem to have 
been published as early as 1885, and which even then had 
probably been delayed because Wundt was not favorable to 
“individual psychology” (91, note, page 618), as the testing 
was then called, comprised ten records and twenty-six 
measurements, aside from physical measurements, and cer- 
tain personal data supplied by the students. They were 
given individually and required from forty minutes to one 
hour for each person. Results of these tests applied to one 
hundred freshmen students were published in 1896, in the 
article cited.
-P-A-G-E-93
  Early Tests of Intelligence 79 
CATTELL’S MENTAL TESTS 
The tests were on keenness of eyesight and of hearing, 
reaction time, after-images, color vision, perception of pitch 
and of weights, sensitivity to pain, color preferences, per- 
ception of time, accuracy of movement, rate of perception 
and of movement, memory, and imagery. Blanks for 
numerous additional data on physical features, personal 
traits, diseases, dreams, habits, artistic tastes, preferences 
for games and recreations, and future plans are presented in 
this report, some of these data to be taken by the tester 
himself and some to be supplied later by the subject. Stu- 
dents were asked to have the tests repeated at the end of 
their sophomore and senior years. These authors, Cattell 
and Farrand, say that they fully appreciate certain arguments 
put forth by Miinsterberg and by Binet and Henri in favor 
of tests of a strictly psychological nature, but they add that 
their present concern is with anthropometric work, “‘and 
measurements of the body and of the senses come as com- 
pletely within our scope as the higher mental processes.” 
They state a preference for these more definite and simple 
tests. “If we undertake to study attention or suggestibility, 
we find it difficult to measure definitely a definite thing: We 
have a complex problem still requiring much research in the 
laboratory and careful analyses before the results can be 
interpreted, and, indeed, before suitable tests can be devised” 
(91, page 623). Thus they justify their emphasis of the 
sensory processes and of the simple reactions. 
TESTS OF PRECONCEIVED MENTAL FUNCTIONS 
BY KRAEPELIN AND OEHRN 
In the meantime several other test series had been pro- 
posed. ‘As early as 1889 Oehrn (170), working under the 
direction of Kraepelin, had pursued a different method, and 
had published results of tests which are probably the “earliest 
ee
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
actual experiments in mental correlation” (198, page 207). 
Tests were devised to measure certain mental capacities, 
selected by Kraepelin somewhat subjectively and arbitrarily, 
and were applied intensively to ten subjects. These tests 
and their classifications were as follows: 1. Perception, 
(a) the counting of letters from the printed page, (6) the 
search for particular letters, or the cancellation test, and 
(c) the noting of errors in proof reading. 2. Memory, the 
learning of series of twelve digits and series of twelve non- 
sense syllables. 3. Association, the adding of single-digit 
numbers. 4. Motor functions, (a) writing from dictation 
and (6) reading, in both cases as fast as possible. Oehrn 
found a positive relationship between numbers 1, 2, and 4, 
but “association” held rather an inverse relation to the other 
capacities thus tested. In a review of this work, Henri 
emphasizes the fact that individual differences increase 
directly with the complexity of the psychical processes 
studied. To the possible significance of this fact we shall 
give attention later. 
Kraepelin, who was professor of psychiatry at Heidelberg, 
proposed a little later, in 1895 (148, and 53, page 431), a_ 
series of fundamental traits, or mental capacities, which he 
regarded as basic factors in the characterization of an indi- 
vidual, whether normal or mentally unstable, and which 
were to be guides in the construction of tests. These so- 
called fundamental traits or dispositions include (1) the 
ability to be influenced by practice, (2) the persistence of 
practice effects, or general memory, (4) special memory 
abilities, (5) fatigability, (6) capacity to recover from fatigue, 
(7) the depth of sleep, (8) the capacity for concentration of 
attention against distraction, and (9) ability to adapt one- 
self to effective work under distracting conditions. This 
list is not complete, we are told, and may be extended. 
For each of these traits Kraepelin devised a certain test
-P-A-G-E-95
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 81 
and assumed, rather arbitrarily, that the degree of the trait 
present in any given individual would be indicated by his 
relative performance in the test. The tests proposed dealt 
chiefly with simple arithmetical processes, and some of them 
were to be extended over long periods of time, requiring for 
their administration one hour daily for five successive days. 
The defects in such a system of tests for most purposes are 
obvious today, though the tests undoubtedly have merits 
for special studies of certain abnormal cases. 
MUNSTERBERG’S TESTS 
In 1891 Miinsterberg (166) described various tests which he 
had made on school children, but he did not give results. 
The tests consisted of (1) reading aloud as rapidly as possible ; 
(2) stating as quickly as possible the colors of ten objects 
whose names were written on a sheet, as “white” for “snow” ; 
(3) reading ten given names of animals, plants, or minerals, 
and giving as quickly as possible the classification of each; 
(4) doing the same for names of cloth, of food, and of parts 
of the body; (5) giving as quickly as possible, when the 
objects were seen, the names of ten simple designs and of 
ten squares of colors; (6) adding ten given single-digit 
numbers; (7) giving as quickly as possible the number of 
angles in ten different irregular polygons; (8) naming three 
different perfumes or odors. Then came tests of another 
kind: (9) finding the number of digits and of letters 
retained by the subject after a single presentation; (10) bi- 
secting a distance of eighty centimeters; (11) judging how 
many times one length is contained in another; (12) repro- 
ducing a perceived length after five seconds; (13) locating a 
sound; and, finally, (14) constructing a square and an 
equilateral triangle of which only the base in each case is 
given. Time records were kept in the speed tests. The 
whole series of tests occupied about one hour for each subject.  
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
These tests, while regarded by Binet and Henri as better 
from the psychological point of view than those of Cattell, 
were nevertheless criticized by them as also being too special 
as regards the simple processes involved, and as devoting 
too much time relatively to speed. They contended that 
there are other mental processes of more importance than 
those tested by Miinsterberg; that while they could not be 
measured with as much precision as these simpler processes, 
they are nevertheless more significant as to individual 
differences (53, page 429). 
JASTROW’S TESTS 
“During the fall of 1890,” says Jastrow, “it was decided 
to ask the students in the general class in psychology to lend 
themselves to a series of physical and psychological tests with 
a view of interesting the students in such tests as well as 
acquiring a body of statistical material which when suffi- 
ciently extended and properly compared with other statistics 
might prove of considerable value” (141, page 420). This 
was in the University of Wisconsin. The tests used were 
applied individually and required about fifty minutes per 
subject. The psychological tests were mainly sensory and 
bilateral movement tests. They were supplemented by 
answers to various questions regarding personal and family 
characteristics. 
In the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Jastrow had, in 
1893, a collection of psychological apparatus and tests, as 
well as norms of physical growth and of mental development. 
The tests comprised five touch and cutaneous sensibility 
tests, (1) estimation of distance of unseen movement of the 
finger, (2) estimation of a surface by touch, (3) weight dis- 
crimination, (4) sensibility to pain, and (5) judgment of 
distances by attempting with eyes closed to make five equi- 
distant marks; five tests involving both touch and vision, 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 83 
(1) making bilaterally equal movements, (2) reproducing 
from memory lines that one has just drawn, (3) tracing lines 
for exactness of movement, (4) hitting with a blunt point 
the center of a cross, for accuracy of perception, and 
(5) spiking a moving object, for rapidity and accuracy of 
localization; and five purely visual tests, (1) arranging 
lines in order of length, (2) marking off certain fractions of a 
given length, (3) marking off a distance on each of the three 
arms of a cross to equal that given by a mark on the fourth 
arm, (4) selecting certain required forms from a hetero- 
geneity of forms, (5) reproducing letters, words, or colors 
after momentary exposure by means of a tachistoscope. 
To these last were added tests of visual acuity, tests of 
color zones, and tests of color blindness. There were also 
memory tests, the reproduction after a given time of letters, 
lines, colors, and forms previously exposed; and, finally, 
tests of reaction time, — rapidity in opening and closing the 
key of an interrupter, and quickness in the simple reaction 
experiment (173). 
Persons who were interested were invited to submit them- 
selves to these tests. The tests are obviously all of a quan- 
titative nature and some are both ingenious and original, but 
comparatively little space is given to tests that involve the 
more complex and general mental functions. Results of 
these tests have not been published, so far as the writer is 
aware. 
TESTS OF CHILDREN BY BOAS AND BOLTON ms. 
In 1891 Boas, then of Clark University, made certain 
anthropological measurements of about 1500 school children, 
and he tested them as to vision, hearing and “memory.” 
He also secured from their teachers estimates of their 
“intellectual acuteness.” Results of the memory tests, 
only, seem to have been published, these being the now  
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 Early Conceptions and Tests oj Intelligence 
well-known digit span test first used by Jacobs. This is 
probably the first attempt to make a comparison of test scores 
with independent estimates of the subjects by other persons, 
as first suggested by Galton. T. L. Bolton, who reported the 
results of an analysis of these data, found that “intellectual 
acuteness, while more often accompanied by a good memory- 
span and great power of concentrated and prolonged atten- 
tion, is not necessarily accompanied by them” (71, page 317). 
GILBERT’S TESTS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS 
Gilbert (116), at New Haven, in 1893, applied several 
mental tests to about 1200 children, and then compared the 
results with their “general ability” as estimated by their 
teachers. He used eight tests besides measures of weight, 
height, and lung capacity — two on sensations; one on 
rapidity of tapping; two on reaction time, simple and choice 
reaction; one on memory of the duration of tones; and one 
on suggestibility. Results show constant improvement 
with age up to the point of puberty, where advancement is 
retarded.! 
Gilbert found what he supposes to be a correspondence of 
intelligence with sensory discrimination both of weights 
and of shades. There was also a slight positive relationship 
between intelligence, as estimated by teachers, and memory, 
tested by having the subject indicate when a tone had con- 
tinued as long as a previously given standard tone. The most 
marked relationship, however, was found between intelligence 
1 This may have influenced Binet in the making of his well-known scale 
later, for in a review of this work he and Henri commented on this fact and 
this sort of criterion. These reviewers say also that while the same scheme 
serves to represent all kinds of results in a quantitative estimate, it is certain 
that Gilbert’s researches do not give all the differences between children 
and adults. The child has not just simply less memory, less motor ability, 
less attention, etc., but he has also a manner of thinking, of reasoning, of 
willing, and of remembering peculiar to himself, as a child; that is, they feel 
that qualitative differences also exist (53, page 433).
-P-A-G-E-99
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 85 
and simple reaction time; but with discrimination and choice 
reactions this relationship was lowered. 
In a second report (117), which appeared three years later 
than his first one, Gilbert describes further tests. For each 
age from six to nineteen years about one hundred children 
were used. The object was (1) to study physical and in- 
tellectual sex differences, (2) to ascertain the comparative 
development of physical and intellectual growth and to de- 
termine whether it is different in the two sexes, and (3) to 
study the interrelations of physical and intellectual growth — 
i.e., to find whether the more intelligent children have also 
the advantage in physical strength and development. The 
tests used were pulse before and after fatigue, height, weight, 
vital capacity, force of raising the wrist and of the arm, 
threshold of pain, estimation of a distance by movement of 
the arm, judgment of distance seen, rate of tapping, fatigue 
effects of tapping. The intelligence of the subjects was 
estimated by their teachers, who classed them into three 
groups, bright, median, and dull. Binet, who reviews these 
tests, comments critically on the length, the probable different 
fatigue effects on subjects of different ages, the inability of the 
younger subjects to indicate uniformly just when pain appears, 
etc., and he says of the experimenter: ‘It seems that he set 
his goal and then proceeded to it with eyes closed, looking 
neither to the right nor to the left.”” He deplores the lack of 
“psychological insight” of the author, but expresses a deep 
interest in his experiments (26, page 654). 
Among the important results, for our present purpose, we 
may note that tapping rate regularly increased with age, and 
that boys were slightly more rapid than girls; that fatigue 
effects decreased with age; that in the judgment tests 
(estimating the length of a line) accuracy increased with age 
and no sex difference appeared. Porter’s (177) findings in 
St. Louis, then recently published, to the effect that the larger 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
and heavier the children are the more intelligent they are, 
were not supported by Gilbert’s correlations of size with 
estimated intelligence. Moreover, on only two tests did 
children rated as superior intellectually surpass other chil- 
dren, — in rate_of tapping and in the judgment of length of 
distances. 
“ BINET AND HENRI ON TESTS IN “INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY” 
Binet and Henri (53) published, in 1895, an article on 
“individual psychology,” a term that had already been 
used by other writers. They reviewed most of the studies 
mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, and criticized them 
as being on the whole too sensory and too much given to the 
study of special and limited abilities of minor significance for 
the determination of important individual differences. Even 
the memory studies that had been made are subject to this 
criticism. They point out that memory is not a simple 
function. One may have a good memory for figures and only 
a medium memory for letters, for example, or for colors. 
Partial memories, as Ribot, Charcot, and others had shown, 
may be impaired or lost in abnormal cases without influence 
on the other memories. ‘One cannot say, then, of an 
individual simply that he has a good memory; it is always 
necessary to state precisely of which memory one speaks. 
Therefore, in order to have an idea of an individual one must 
not simply be content with studies of a particular partial 
memory, such as that of letters or of figures, but must include 
as many partial memories as possible” (page 419). 
They also raise the question of the interrelation of the 
different mental functions of any individual. Some persons 
are found to be slow in certain reactions, such as walking; 
they prefer slow music, probably are slow in reaction experi- 
ments, etc., but are we justified in concluding that such 
persons are in general slower than others whose reactions
-P-A-G-E-101
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 87 
in these respects are different? Certainly not; we can only 
say that probably one is slower than another whose reactions 
of this sort are quicker. It is necessary, then, they hold, to 
be very cautious regarding conclusions on these different 
methods and on the data they yield. 
These authors believe it possible to select certain tests 
_ that will suffice for given practical purposes, and they em- 
phasize the need of having different tests for different pur- 
poses and different endowments. One should not employ 
the same tests “‘to compare two masons as would be used to 
compare two students or two children of a school” (page 
434). While it is not necessary, of course, to test all func- 
tions in which individuals differ, it is important to select for 
our testing those functions that are most characteristic or 
most significant in distinguishing between any two persons. 
They chose for their purpose not the simplest and the most 
elementary functions, but the “superior psychic faculties” 
or the higher complex functions. They contend that in the 
measurement of these functions great precision is not neces- 
sary because individual differences are more marked here 
than in the simple functions that have been most studied. 
They propose to study the following ten mental processes 
or functions: ‘‘memory, the nature of mental images, 
imagination,. attention, the faculty of comprehension, sug- 
gestibility, sesthetic appreciation, moral sentiments, muscular 
force and force of will, motor skill, and judgment of visual 
space (coup d’eil)”’ (page 435). The methods, they hold, 
should be simple and should not take too much time, and 
they should be objective so, that results of different experi- 
menters may be comparable. Let us examine these tests. 
1. The memory tests proposed comprise (a)‘visual memory 
of a geometrical design, (b) memory of a sentence, (c) memory 
of some musical notes played by the tester, (d) memory of 
colors, and (e) memory of digits. The authors hold that the  
-P-A-G-E-102
  88 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
memory tests should give information regarding the subject’s 
general power of acquisition; his power of voluntary con- 
centration of attention; his tastes and tendencies, inasmuch 
as these will influence certain special or particular memories ; 
his general mental dispositions as shown in the sort of errors, 
substitutions, omissions, etc., that he makes; and finally, 
and most important of all, his power of comprehension, by 
which his memories will be greatly affected. 
2. The test of images suggested is that of letting the 
subject reproduce by writing what he can recall of twelve 
randomly selected letters in three rows of four in each row, 
previously shown him long enough for two readings at a 
natural rate. 
8. The tests of imagination were to begin with a few ques- 
tions regarding the subject’s tastes, the nature of his pre- 
ferred readings, the kind of pleasure which he seeks, his 
tastes as to music, theaters, etc. The authors then propose 
for involuntary imagination such tests as the ink-blot tests, 
and for voluntary or creative imagination, the linguistic 
invention test. Of the latter class are given (a) the con- 
struction of a sentence which must embody three given 
nouns or verbs and no other words of the same part of speech ; 
and (b) the development in writing of some given theme, as 
‘A child lost in a forest.” For the latter a specified amount 
of time, six minutes for example, should be allowed and 
announced in advance. 
4. Attention tests are divided into measurements of the 
duration and the scope of attention. The authors express 
embarrassment at having to describe tests of “attention,” 
which, despite the many attempts to study it, is still little 
understood as to its essential aspects. They suggest for 
duration of attention tests like reproduction by memory, 
in several successive trials, of a line of a given length pre- 
viously seen, the subject to see the original model but once.
-P-A-G-E-103
  Early Tests of Intelligence 89 
The successive lengths are to be noted, as to whether they 
vary regularly or irregularly, and a curve plotted. They also 
cite an a-cancellation test (now well known) by Bourdon. 
For the scope-of-attention test they suggest the counting 
of the total number of strokes of two metronomes of but 
slightly different speeds. Speeds are to be increased grad- 
ually in successive trials up to the subject’s limit. Normal 
persons, they find, can count the strokes at a rate up 
to fifty or sixty a minute. The execution of several acts 
simultaneously is also given as a test for scope of attention. 
For example, the subject’s natural time for reading ten lines 
is noted, and then the time is again taken for reading ten 
similar lines while he also writes the letters of the alphabet 
or while he writes numbers. 
5. Tests of comprehension — which they admit is a complex 
function, including “talent of observation,” “spirit of ~ 
ingenuity” (lesprit de finesse), and others — must be some- 
what complex. Tests tentatively proposed are (a) the de- 
scription of the movements made by a sewing machine in a 
given period of time, or those of a crawling insect; (6) the 
giving of the similarities and the differences between two or 
among several synonyms, as goodness, tenderness, and amia- 
bility; and (c) the criticizing of certain statements each of 
which contains some impropriety of terms, some sophism, or 
some error of reasoning. 
6. Suggestibility tests, which must not be mere illusion 
tests, fall under several heads: 
(a) Sensations and Perceptions. These are tests pub- 
lished by the authors themselves in 1894. The subject 
selects from a group of lines on separate cards one line each 
time to match another shown just previously or simultane- 
ously by the tester, so that the test may be performed either 
by memory or by direct perception. The tester presents 
successively lines of increasing length and returns each to the
-P-A-G-E-104
    
90 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
| 
tray, from which the subject selects lines to match. But 
finally he presents a line which, unknown to the subject, 
was not selected from this group and which is longer than any 
line in the tray. Of children about ten years of age the 
majority choose lines from the tray, which they suppose are 
equal to it. Also a series of bottles containing faint odors 
is presented to the subject, who smells each and records 
its odor. All actually have odors except one or two bottles, 
in which there is only pure water. 
(6) Imagination or Expectant Attention. A tube. is 
adjusted to a wheel which revolves and gives for each revolu- 
tion a sharp click. The subject is told to put his finger into 
this tube, that he will feel with each click an extremely weak 
sensation (the nature of which is not indicated to him), and 
that the sensation will increase in intensity with every turn 
of the wheel. He is required to describe what he experiences. 
The quality of sensation imagined, as well as the intensity, 
is to be noted in the subject’s report. 
(c) Emotivity, Apprehension, Fear. Many tests may be 
made with the algesiometer. Two examples given are: 
(1) The subject is told that successively increased pressure is 
to be applied and he is to say when pain appears. The 
experiment is repeated. According to Jastrow’s observa- 
tions, in the first test the subject stops the pressure earlier 
than in the second. The difference is the measure of appre- 
hension. (2) The subject is himself allowed to choose the 
degree of pain to which he is willing to submit. 
(d) Involuntary Conscious and Unconscious Movements. 
(1) Conscious Movements. The subject is asked to copy in 
capitals as quickly as possible a given list of words, both nouns 
and adjectives. The list is printed in small letters. There is 
thus a conflict between the text seen and the instructions of 
the experimenter. A much larger per cent of errors (omis- 
sion of capitals) is made on the adjectives than on the nouns.
-P-A-G-E-105
  Early Tests of Intelligence 91 
(2) Unconscious Movements. The noting or recording of 
automatic movements (behind a screen) of one’s hand while 
one reads or converses attentively or while one thinks atten- 
tively of some name. 
7. Aisthetic appreciation. The subject is to arrange in 
order of preference a number of objects or experiences of 
varying degree of beauty, such as a number of rectangles of 
different proportions, a number of cards of different colors, 
and a graduated series of musical phrases. The correct order 
of the members in these series is to be determined, as a cri- 
terion, by getting the judgments of a number of competent 
persons. 
8. Moral sentiments. Objects capable of exciting the 
subject, and various important pictures, are shown him in a 
natural way so that he does not know it is an experiment but 
will think it is done just for his interest in the object and the 
views themselves. His behavior is then carefully noted, special 
attention being given to what he looks at and how long, 
apparent effects produced, and so on. 
9. Muscular force and force of will. For this they suggest 
the lifting and sustaining of certain weights and the noting 
of the subject’s duration of effort, the trembling in sustained 
effort, the degree of lowering of the hand, respiratory and 
other changes; also, pulling with one finger against a 
certain known weight, so that the amount of work done can 
be calculated, the subject being required to make a series of 
movements as rapidly as possible and to continue as long 
as possible despite fatigue. The duration of voluntary 
muscular effort of this kind affords a “true measure of will.” 
The authors do not regard the dynamometer and the Mosso 
ergograph as suitable for these tests, but prefer simpler tests 
not necessitating complex apparatus and not requiring partic- 
ular methods of pressure or flexion movements. 
10. Motor skill and judgment of visual space. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
motor skill the well-known tapping test, early used by W. L. 
Bryan (79), and the steadiness test are recommended. As 
visual judgment tests they suggest such things as having the 
subject estimate how many times a given line is contained 
in another longer line, having him divide a line into seven 
equal parts, and having him indicate on a circumference the 
third part of its entire length. 
Their suggestions are put forth as tentative and the tests 
are recognized by them as needing additions and modifica- 
tions; but they hold that changes should be made only by 
means of practical tests and experimentation. “We believe 
all the same,” they say, “that having obtained responses to 
all the preceding questions and having afterwards interro- 
gated the subject on his principal occupations, one will be 
able to form an idea of the ensemble of the faculties of the 
individual” (pages 463, 464). 
The tests as outlined were so chosen that a subject could 
be taken through the entire series in an hour, or in an hour 
and a half at most, and the authors suggest that they be 
added to or modified as conditions demand. They doubt 
the sufficiency of the tests to characterize well the differences 
between two persons of the same occupation and living in 
similar social environment, but believe them suitable to 
give useful information concerning such differences when the 
subjects differ more widely than this. They indicate various 
practical fields in which the tests may be used to advantage 
by educators, doctors, justices, and others. Mental tests, 
they conclude, ought to be as varied as possible so as to in- 
clude a large number of functions, especially of the higher 
complex ones; they should be so varied that in the sixty 
to ninety minutes of their administration they will neither 
fatigue nor bore the individual subjected to them; they 
should be adapted to the conditions of social environment 
under which the subject lives; and, finally, they should not 
require complicated apparatus.  
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 93 
No results, other than those indicated incidentally in our 
discussion of the several tests, were given in this early test 
series by Binet and his collaborator, and no suggestions 
regarding standardization into a scale are made. 
EARLY AMERICAN COMMITTEES ON TESTS 
The test developments and systems of tests which we have 
considered give, probably, a fair idea of the movement in 
the early nineties toward intelligence testing. There were 
also used at that comparatively early date numerous single 
tests, such as tests of memory, imagery, and other special 
functions, these being employed for various psychological 
purposes. The tests that we have considered, however, 
were suggested or used with more or less explicit reference 
to use as intelligence tests or tests of one’s general abilities, 
as distinct from special abilities. 
At the Philadelphia meeting of the American Psychological 
Association in December, 1895, a committee, consisting of 
Professors Cattell, J. M. Baldwin, Jastrow, Sanford, and 
Witmer, “was appointed to consider the feasibility of co- 
operation among the various psychological laboratories in 
the collection of mental and physical statistics” (91, page 
619). It should also be noted that at the Buffalo meeting 
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
in August, 1896, “a standing committee, consisting of Messrs. 
Brinton, Cattell, McGee, Newell, and Boas, was appointed 
to organize an ethnographic survey of the white race in the 
United States.” “It is important,” says Cattell in this 
same year, in referring to this committee, “that psychological 
tests be included in this survey, and that the work be co- 
ordinated with that proposed by the Psychological Associa- 
tion” (ibid., pages 619, 620). 
It is not difficult to discover the moving spirit behind the 
appointment of these committees, especially when one knows  
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
that Cattell had described his early experiments in testing 
before the New York Academy of Sciences in May, 1895, 
and also before the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science in August, 1896, and that his student, Dr. L. 
Farrand, had presented a paper on this subject before the 
American Psychological Association in the Philadelphia 
meeting, in 1895, already mentioned. 
The testing movement in the nineties seems to have be- 
come so important in the minds of some live educational 
administrators who themselves were not psychologists, that 
in 1899 President W. R. Harper of the University of Chicago, 
then a very young institution, “recommended that a special 
study be made of the college student’s character, intellectual 
capacity, and tastes, by the questionnaire method” (86, 
page 4). It will be recalled that both Galton and Cattell 
had made use of this method in connection with tests. In- 
dividual tests were, of course, too detailed and time- 
consuming to be employed for such practical purposes and 
on so large a scale. 
WHY DID THIS TESTING MOVEMENT ABATE? 
Why did this whole movement, then, come to so little im- 
mediate practical effect, as we know it did, that actual testing 
of students on a large scale in educational institutions was 
delayed for about twenty years? Why, moreover, did not 
the psychological laboratories, with rare exceptions to be 
noted, and the American Psychological Association keep 
up the large interest that had been aroused in this early 
testing movement? The answer to this question is probably 
not difficult when we follow for a few years further, as we 
shall do in the next chapter, the work in the laboratory 
directed by the principal supporter in America of this testing 
movement, and when we also consider the effects of an ex- 
perimental study on the evaluation of certain tests, carried
-P-A-G-E-109
  
Early Tests of Intelligence 95 
out in the Cornell University laboratory. There were, of 
course, also several other factors operating toward this 
general minimizing of the importance of tests in America.

  CHAPTER SIX 
Sensory AND ParticuLar Tests versus TESTS OF 
CompLex aND Hicuer Functions 
“INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY’? AND ITS PROBLEMS 
Binet seems to have been the first French psychologist to 
employ the term “individual psychology” (27, note, page 
113). The term was also used by Oehrn in the study cited 
in the last chapter, and his and Kraepelin’s work certainly 
dealt with aspects of the subject even though Kraepelin 
worked mainly with abnormal cases. The significance 
given to the term by Binet is practically that implied by 
our “mental measurement” today and refers to the dif- 
ferentiation of one individual from another in general ability 
on the basis of tests of characteristic traits. In their article 
on La Psychologie Individuelle, Binet and Henri make clear 
their conception of individual psychology and of the methods 
to be employed by it, and they bring clearly to the foreground 
the question as to differences between the conventional 
experimental psychology and this newer field of study. We 
have already seen that the various studies by American 
writers, considered in the foregoing chapter, as well as some 
of the studies by Galton, were aiming rather directly at the 
question of evaluating and distinguishing the general men- 
talities of different individuals. 
The idea of developing a system of mental tests for prac- 
tical purposes in the scientific study of man and in his educa- 
tion and betterment had, indeed, become rather explicit in| 
the early nineties, but the article by the two French psycholo- 
gists attempted not only to outline definitely the problems o: 
this newer field of psychological research, but to evaluate th 
different methods which had been proposed or actually use 
by various investigators. The English and American studie 
96 
     
                              
    
         
  
-P-A-G-E-111
  
Sensory and Particular Tests 97 
had included a large proportion of anthropometric measure- 
ments as well as of the conventional tests of sensory dis- 
crimination and reaction time, and there were appearing a 
number of studies of memory as influenced by different sorts 
of factors and measured in various ways, and of tests of other 
more or less special mental functions, with little relation to 
general mental ability ; so this important article by the great 
pioneer in mental testing and his collaborator was timely. 
While Binet and Henri classified the main problems of 
individual psychology as (1) the study of the extent and the 
nature of the variations of the psychic processes from one 
individual to another, and (2) the determination of the inter- 
relations of these various processes in any single individual 
as to whether they are mutually dependent or whether some 
are fundamental processes upon which all others depend, it 
is clear that their interest was really more in the individual 
than in the processes themselves. What they were after 
was a series of tests which would bring out most clearly the 
large differences in ability among different persons. 
     
         
   
          
     
   
        
     
       
   ARE COMPLEX MENTAL FUNCTIONS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
TO MEASURE? 
It will be recalled that most of the other experimenters 
hom we have considered put the emphasis on the sensory 
iscriminative functions, reaction times, and certain other 
articular functions. Galton had suggested that there may 
a relation between sensory discrimination and general 
ntellectual ability and had devised for weight discrimination, 
ssociation, and memory span certain tests that could be 
arried out quantitatively. His influence on early tests in 
merica is obvious from the tests enumerated in the pre- 
ding chapter. Such tests, like his own, attempted to take 
ome simple function and to study it with great accuracy. 
he simple functions, as opposed to the complex ones, were
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
held, rightly in the main, to yield the more constant or 
reliable results; and so they seemed to many investigators 
the more suitable for scientific testing. This was in line 
with the objectivity of the anthropometric measurements 
which were usually closely associated with mental tests. 
Thus Cattell and Farrand had expressed their preference for 
the more definite and simple tests over the more complex ones 
which needed much research and careful analysis before their 
results could be interpreted. 
Gilbert’s tests were all subject to exact numerical meas- 
urements. The “voluntary motor ability” was determined 
by measuring the number of taps the subject could make on 
a suitable piece of apparatus in five minutes, and fatigue was 
measured by the proportion of loss of speed after forty-five 
seconds. Reaction times, both simple and discriminative, 
were measured with a chronoscope in hundredths of a second. 
The “force of suggestion’’ was determined by the difference 
in weights picked out by the child to match respectively a) 
large and a small object of equal weight. Memory of time 
intervals was measured by letting the chronoscope run for a! 
certain period of time and then, in a second trial, having the 
subject stop it when it had, in his estimation, run an equal 
period of time. There could be no question as to the objec- 
tivity of such tests. Similar definiteness and_ precision 
characterized the tests by Jastrow and those. by Miinsterberg. 
All these tests in America reflect clearly, besides the influ-} 
ence of Galton, that of the German experimental psychology, 
which had taken hold of so many of the early America: 
psychologists who had been students of Wundt. 
In the work of Kraepelin and Oehrn exactness of measure: 
ment is also emphasized. Strict time records were kept i 
the variousymeasurements, and their mean variations ii 
different individuals were investigated; however, the 
tests demanded little apparatus and no highly refined tech.

nique. They approached more closely than did the early 
American tests the normal processes in daily life. Really 
only the method here is simple, and this is true merely because 
a succession of similar responses is studied rather than the 
simple reactions separately. For example, Kraepelin in 
studying reaction time would have his subjects add single 
digit numbers, write from dictation, read a given selection 
as quickly as possible, etc., and he would time each entire 
series of acts. This method is obviously much simpler than 
measuring one’s simple reaction with a chronoscope, but the 
responses of the subject require more complex adjustments 
and approximate therefore more closely the reactions in our 
daily work. Kraepelin’s work was of course based on a 
rather thorough study of abnormal individuals, but his tests 
were supposed to evaluate certain mental qualities in normal 
individuals as well. It is, however, significant that his 
greater interest in the individual, forced by the nature of his 
work, is associated with less use of the sensory tests than was 
made in the American testing. 
Binet’s interest was greater in individuals than in sensa- 
tions or ideas, and in this respect he but reflected the charac- 
teristic of the French psychology, interested in personalities 
deviating from the normal. In this relation one recalls 
Charcot, Ribot, Janet, and others, all of whom were little 
influenced by the English psychology of “ deas,” and by 
the German experimental psychology with its emphasis on 
sensory discrimination. The environment in which Binet 
had grown up was favorable to a strong emphasis on the 
whole individual in psychological study. Itard, Seguin, 
and others had led out in the Ine of the subnormal, too, and 
in Binet this tendency is combined with that of studying 
the dissociated personality. So in this period the new tend- 
ency to emphasize,individual psychology is most strongly 
expressed in Binet.

ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THE “‘ ANNEXE PSYCHOLOGIQUE ” 
In 1895 appeared the first volume of L’ Année Psychologique, 
a journal founded by Binet and published by him and his 
collaborators up to the time of his death in 1911. The 
influence of this man on the testing movement in the nineties 
and the two following decades can hardly be overstated. He 
threw the weight of his influence, in the first place, definitely 
toward the emphasis of empirical psychology, and asserted 
in the first sentence of the Introduction in the Année that the 
progress of psychology dates from its separation from meta-_ 
physics. The metaphysical tendencies, he asserted, “dis- 
appeared fortunately with Taine, Spencer, and Bain, to cite 
only the celebrated authors.” Psychology was, in his view, 
to become a science of observation and experimentation — 
that is, a verifiable science like other natural sciences; and 
it must put aside “‘all speculation on the nature and essence 
of the soul and of its origin and destiny.” These questions 
are profitless for it because it is impossible to resolve them 
scientifically. The mission of psychology is more simple 
and more precise, to collect data necessary to establish a 
science of man on which alone the social sciences, education, 
and criminology might have a solid foundation. To this 
work the Année was devoted, and one is surprised to note in 
its successive volumes the extent of review and original 
work done by Binet and his collaborators during the remain- 
ing sixteen years of his life. 
BINET CONTENDED FOR TESTS OF COMPLEX MENTAL 
FUNCTIONS 
In the second place Binet emphasized, as we have said, 
individual psychology, and raised the important question 
as to what sort of differences among individuals should be 
1 Binet was born in 1857 and died in 1911.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Sensory and Particular Tests 101 
studied, since it is impracticable to study all differences 
thoroughly. In the article cited above Binet and Henri 
objected to sensory discrimination tests, which had at that 
time been most extensively used from the time of Galton’s 
beginning. They admitted that these tests are more simple 
and objective than the tests of the higher complex functions, 
and that they can be repeated by different investigators under 
more nearly identical conditions. Likewise they objected 
to various tests of particular memories, reactions, etc., as 
we have noted in the preceding chapter. They maintained 
that these elementary processes are precisely the ones in 
which persons differ least; that individual differences are 
most marked in the complex and higher processes which 
usually distinguish the everyday activities of one individual 
from those of another. While these processes are admittedly 
more difficult to investigate by experimental methods and 
will therefore give more variable results, it was maintained 
that tests of such complex functions are relatively much 
more significant and that the demand for precision is there- 
fore not so great as it is in the case of the simple processes. 
In the article cited they show no data to establish this view, 
but simply base it on an analysis of the various tests that 
have been proposed or used, and on the small relationship 
found between efficiency in the tests and teachers’ estimates 
of ability. 
THE SHARP-TITCHENER STUDY OF THE CLAIMS 
FOR COMPLEX TESTS 
If now we turn to the early test movement in America, we 
find two reports that bear directly on the question at issue, 
and that probably were influential toward dampening the 
enthusiasm of the testers. One of these reports, by Stella 
Emily Sharp (188), from Titchener’s laboratory at Cornell, 
is on a special investigation of the question so strongly put 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
forth by Binet and Henri, as to the relative value “for 
individual psychology” of sensory discriminative and rather 
special tests on the one hand and of the more inaccurate tests 
of the higher, complex mental functions on the other. These 
experiments were carried out in the academic year 1897- 
1898. ‘The theory was provisionally accepted that the 
complex mental processes, rather than the elementary 
processes, are those the variations of which give the most 
important information in regard to the mental character- 
istics whereby individuals are commonly classed. It is in 
the complex processes, we assumed, and in those alone, 
that individual differences are sufficiently great to enable 
us to differentiate one individual from others of the same 
class. Many of the particular tests recommended by the 
French psychologists were also adopted, but were con- 
siderably modified in the general conditions of their applica- 
tion by the purpose of our own investigation” (page 348). 
The specific aim was to test the practicability of the particular 
tests employed, while the general aim was to evaluate the 
general position of Binet and Henri. 
To be sure that differences obtained would represent real 
individual differences, and not mere chance variations; i.e., 
to test the reliability of the tests proposed, “‘it is necessary 
to apply them to the same individuals, not once, but several 
times, in order that it may be observed whether the varia- 
tions in the different individuals maintain a constant relation 
to one another at various times and, consequently, under 
varying subjective conditions. Instead of single tests, 
therefore, series of similar tests for each activity were ar- 
ranged. This necessitated, of course, a very large extension 
of the time beyond the limits allowed by the French investi- 
gators. The advantages of a short period of varied experi- 
mentation were, however, to a large degree attained. The 
experimental work of each subject was divided into periods of
-P-A-G-E-117
Sensory and Particular Tests 103 
one hour each, and separated by intervals of one week. 
Within a single hour-period the tests were varied as much as 
possible” (page 349). Thus the tedium and fatigue of the rep- 
etition of similar operations were avoided and interest to a 
fair extent maintained. Certain tests “especially trying or 
disagreeable to the subjects” were separated by more than a 
week. Among such tests are given “the development of a 
theme” and “description of a scene or event,” tests for con- 
structive imagination. 
The subjects and the tests. The subjects were advanced 
college students in psychology and were, therefore, highly 
selected as to ability and education, certainly representing the 
same class to a marked degree. They were grouped in twos 
or threes for most of the experiments, to save time. For a 
comparison of this group with a less highly trained group, 
and therefore as a control on the experiment, data on “less 
advanced students taking the undergraduate (junior year) 
course in experimental psychology” were also used. These 
students were tested by Titchener usually during the “first 
ten minutes of the lecture hour” (page 350). The tests 
suggested by Binet and Henri were not all used; so while 
those here tried out were more intensively applied, they were 
less extensive in the field covered, being restricted to those 
dealing “most directly with the intellectual processes.” 
The “moral sentiment” and “strength of will” tests were 
left out, and those of the “‘ssthetic sentiments” were but 
lightly touched. 
The tests used in this study were: 1. Memory. Memory 
span of letters, of figures, of words, and of sentences, and 
three general questions on the ability.to carry and reproduce 
an air (really not a test at all). 2. Mental images. Binet’s 
letter square test, and answers written by the subject as to 
the nature of the mental images from which his reproductions 
were made. 3. Imagination. (a) Passive. The blot test and
-P-A-G-E-118
  
104 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
answers to questions regarding how the subject represents 
to himself when they are spoken such terms as “force,” 
“infinity,” “justice,” ete. (6) Constructive. (1) Mechan- 
ical, in which the subject was to explain the mechanism 
of a device shown him. (2) Literary, involving the con- 
struction of a sentence, the development of a theme, and the 
choice of a topic for composition; and answers to questions 
regarding the subject’s reading, fondness for games, the 
theater, opera, etc. 4. Attention. (1) Its degree, letter 
cancellation, (2) its range, — the reading of a certain passage 
of ten lines, its re-reading while writing a’s, a third reading 
while writing a b repeatedly, a fourth while writing a b c, and 
a fifth while writing as far as possible in the whole alphabet. 
The time of each performance was noted. 5. Observation 
and description. The reproduction of a picture, the repro- 
duction and locating of the colors on a picture of a lady 
brilliantly dressed, and the writing of distinctions between a 
pair of synonyms. 6. Taste and tendencies. Information 
tests about works of art, music, and literature, and replies 
to questions as in 3. 
Results and conclusions. Results on the seven advanced 
students only can be given, some of these not being in quan- 
titative form because the experiments did not permit this. 
Reliability measures that would today be required in a work 
of this kind and the data on which they would be based are 
not given, but a thorough analysis of results is made by 
methods then in use. The data as given are inadequate 
for any reliable conclusions, as we should view them with the 
advantage of better methods today. ‘‘The results, we 
believe,” says the author, “have shown that while a large 
proportion of the tests require intrinsic modification, or a 
more rigid control of conditions, others have really given 
such information as the individual psychologist seeks. . . . 
In general, however, a lack of correspondences in the
-P-A-G-E-119
Sensory and Particular Tests 105 
individual differences observed in the various tests was 
quite as noticeable as their presence. ... Whether the 
fact indicates a relative independence of the particular 
mental activities under investigation, or is due simply to 
superficiality of testing, can hardly be decided. While, 
however, we do not reject the latter possibility, we incline 
to the belief that the former hypothesis is in a large pro- 
portion of cases the more correct” (page 389). The general 
thoroughness of this study and the justice of the conclusion 
are appealing. 
The author further points out the need of repeating the 
tests on any individuals studied. “‘Series of such tests are 
necessary in order to show constant individual character- 
istics. The tests, to be sure, if enlarged to cover a wider 
range of activities, might be useful for roughly classifying a 
large number of individuals of very different training, 
occupation, etc., provided that the greatest care were taken 
that the conditions in the case of each individual should be 
as favorable as possible. And, on the other hand, certain 
groups of tests, especially selected for a particular purpose, 
and applied, once each in series, to a limited number of 
individuals, might yield valuable information on points 
which particular circumstances rendered of practical im- 
portance. As engineers, pilots, and others, who have to 
act upon information from colored signals, are roughly tested 
for color blindness, so other classes might often profitably 
be submitted to a psychological testing of those higher 
activities which are especially involved in their respective 
lines of duty.” But “much preliminary work must be 
done before such special investigations can be of any great 
worth. This appears plainly from the present investigation, 
where the positive results have been wholly incommensurate 
with the labor required for the devising of tests and 
evaluation of results.” Again, it is stated that the method 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
106 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence — 
employed by Binet is for individual psychology “‘the one 
most productive of fruitful results,” but it is qualified by an 
assertion of the need of exhaustive studies of results of series 
of similar tests given to few individuals at different times 
and in varying circumstances, these studies to cover all the 
principal psychical activities. 
“Tn fine,” the statement continues, “we concur with MM. 
Binet and Henri in believing that individual psychical dif- 
ferences should be sought for in the complex rather than 
in the elementary processes of mind, and that the test 
method is the most workable one that has yet been proposed 
for investigating these processes. The theory of the German 
psychologists, who hold that the simplest mental processes 
are those to which the investigator should look for a clue 
to all the psychical differences existing among individuals, 
we believe would be productive of small or, at any rate, of 
comparatively unimportant results.”” Nevertheless, a com- 
bination of the two methods, the more exact German with 
the Binet method, is recommended; but just what is to be 
combined is not indicated, except that greater accuracy is 
suggested for the Binet method. 
One thing is now clear to us regarding this study of the 
validity of Binet’s conception and general method. How- 
ever carefully and thoroughly the investigation was carried 
out and however judiciously the conclusions were drawn, a 
point of supreme importance was overlooked. The subjects 
tested were of so specialized and highly selected a nature, 
and constituted so homogeneous a group, that consistent 
and reliable differences would be hard to establish with even 
the best of tests. Where differences are very small it requires 
a corresponding high degree of refinement of tools and method 
to measure them. It is a simple matter to devise tests that 
will distinguish reliably between a dull and a bright boy; 
but such tests may prove very unreliable if applied to two
-P-A-G-E-121
Sensory and Particular Tests 107 
geniuses, and their value may in the latter case be entirely 
covered up by the differences of special abilities which have 
little significance for general intelligence. Binet had not 
claimed that his early tests could indicate important dif- 
ferences among individuals of homogeneous groups; he 
explicitly stated the contrary of this. It was rather remark- 
able, then, that under the conditions the Cornell study 
supported the Binet method as much as it did, and very 
unfortunate that the significance of these positive results 
should have been obscured among repeated cautions, con- 
ditions, and recommendations of similar studies of small 
groups, usually highly selected. It is safe to say that the 
structural psychology methods then used in the same labora- 
tory could not have come out better than, if indeed as well 
as, did this “test method,” as it was called ; but their qualita- 
tive nature did not permit of a critical evaluation. It should 
be noted, too, that several of the tests used in this investiga- 
tion were really tests of particular abilities, not of complex 
mental functions, and that not a few of them were only 
“qualitative.” 
The Sharp study states also in its conclusions that investi- 
gations by means of tests will yield very little for mor- 
phological or structural psychology, because so many part- 
processes are involved in the complex mental activities “that 
it is seldom possible to tell with certainty what part of the 
total result is due to any particular component. It is doubt- 
ful if even the most rigorous and exhaustive analysis of test 
results would yield information of importance as regards 
the structure of mind. At all events, there is not the slightest 
reason to desert current laboratory methods for the ‘method 
of tests’” (page 389). This was doubtless very consoling 
to many minds troubled with the feeling that they should 
give some of their attention to the test movement, and its 
effect was probably very great in America toward dampen-   
 
-P-A-G-E-122
      
108 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ing the interest in tests. The statement, moreover, shows 
clearly that the interest of the investigator was in “part- 
processes” such as imagery, memory, etc., a point of view 
foreign to that of Binet. Both interests may, of course, be 
legitimate for different purposes. 
WISSLER’S REPORT ON CORRELATIONS OF 
THE CATTELL TESTS 
Following closely upon this study, which, though sup- 
porting Binet’s conception as to the value of testing the 
complex processes, surrounded the positive results with so 
many conditions as greatly to minimize their promise, and 
admitted the value of the “test method” only in rather 
incidental connections with psychology, was another report 
which also doubtless had far-reaching effects toward diminish- 
ing the enthusiasm for tests in certain American laboratories. 
This second report was by Clark Wissler (233) in 1901, and 
consisted of an analysis by the Pearson correlation method 
of the data resulting from the psychological tests and anthro- 
pometric measurements in Cattell’s laboratory. In this 
study correlations were made for the first time with a degree 
of mathematical precision. As a criterion of the general 
ability of the students the average grade of each student in| 
all of his college studies was taken. The records and tes 
results of 250 freshmen and of 35 seniors of Barnard College| 
were considered. The data were classed under three mai: 
divisions: psychological tests, college grades, and physica! 
tests. The correlations between different pairs of psycho: 
logical tests ranged from — .28 to .39, showing “little mor 
than a mere chance relation.” Since there was “‘no evidenc 
of any important functional relations between the activitie 
employed” (234, page 540), the author concluded that th 
psychological tests must be measures of special abiliti 
only. The physical tests showed a general tendency t 
          
    
      
    
    
  
-P-A-G-E-123
  Sensory and Particular Tests 109 
correlate among themselves, such as height with weight, 
for example, but only to a very slight degree was there a 
positive relationship between physical measurements and 
psychological tests. While correlations between different 
pairs of college courses were appreciable, ranging from .11 
to .75, the relations of these academic marks either to the 
psychological tests or to the physical measurements were 
unreliable and but little more than could be obtained by 
| mere chance. 
PROBABLE EFFECTS OF THE TWO STUDIES ON 
THE TESTING MOVEMENT 
The extent of the effect of these two important studies on 
early testing in America is not easy to determine, but the 
studies were probably influential against the testing move- 
ment and in favor of the regular laboratory studies of sensa- 
tions, imagery, memory, etc., and the more theoretical 
psychology represented in the two volumes of James’s great 
work, The Principles of Psychology, published in 1890. 
While these introspective and somewhat theoretical tenden- 
cies have had certain good effects upon American education 
in general and while their data still constitute the major 
part of psychology courses in colleges and universities, it is 
probable that, through losing sight of the positive implica- 
tions of the Sharp study and of the fact that the Wissler 
study only demonstrated what Binet had asserted regarding 
sensory tests and tests of particular abilities, American 
investigators were impressed with the uselessness of intelli- 
gence tests and so failed to be much influenced by the work 
of Binet. That is to say, though the results of these two 
important investigations were favorable to the position urged 
by Binet, they were probably interpreted by undiscriminat- 
ing and little-interested psychologists as adverse to the 
French view. When the Binet-Simon tests later appeared
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
in America, they took root at first mainly in institutions for 
subnormals. We heard little of them in college courses in 
psychology in the first decade of this century. 
BINET FINDS ENCOURAGEMENT IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN 
STUDIES 
While these developments, unfavorable to the testing 
movement in America, were taking place here, Binet found 
in Europe some encouragement for his own position. The 
earlier experiments of Oehrn under the direction of Kraepelin, 
while influenced in a measure by the Wundtian experimental 
psychology, as Miss Sharp has said in her article, were never- 
theless in an important way supports to Binet’s contention 
for the need of studying the complex processes. As we have 
already noted, only the method was simple, while the pro- 
cesses studied were actually complex and the primary in- 
terest in Kraepelin’s work was in individuals. The French 
school received encouragement in the simplicity of the 
methods with which such complex mental activities could 
be studied, and Henri, who regularly reviewed the various 
German investigations in the Année, remarked in a review of | 
Oehrn’s experiments that his results show an increase of in- 
dividual differences with the complexity of the psychic 
processes studied (129, page 796). 
FERRARI'S TESTS IN ITALY 
Similar encouragement (23, pages 296 f.) came from certain 
Italian studies under the direction of Ferrari, who, like 
Kraepelin at Heidelberg, was interested in pathological 
psychology. In an article (124) that appeared in 1896 we 
find a description of some of the tests used. Among these 
tests, which include some motor strength and skill tests and 
a vasomotor test (with the plethymograph), we find one test 
of the range of apprehension, one of description of pictures,
-P-A-G-E-125
Sensory and Particular Tests 
   and one test of “organic memory.” In the description test, 
subjects are shown in succession eighteen pictures of actors 
in different stages of adrama. Each is to describe after each 
exposure what he saw and to give his judgment and inter- 
pretation of it and associated imaginations. In the last test 
named, the subject sees a revolving disk so marked that he 
can observe the several revolutions. He is told to take note 
of the time period of each revolution, and then with eyes 
closed he is to indicate by signals his estimate of when sub- 
sequent revolutions are completed. The tests are not put 
forth as a complete set. While nothing is established finally 
in these tests, they reveal interesting individual differences. 
EBBINGHAUS IN GERMANY FINDS THE COMPLEX COMPLETION 
TEST SUPERIOR 
Another experiment that encouraged Binet (23, pages 
296 f.) and influenced him in his later devising of tests, was 
that carried out in the city of Breslau by Ebbinghaus (111). 
Having been called upon to assist in the solution of a problem 
regarding fatigue effects in school children, this psychologist, 
in codperation with a certain committee of testers, applied, 
in the morning and before each period of the school work 
for only a few minutes, three tests of mental processes as 
follows: (1) rapid calculation, adding and multiplying simple 
numbers as rapidly as possible; (2) memory of digits, these 
being read in series of different lengths to groups of students 
who were to write all that they could remember; and (8) the 
completion of sentences by supplying, in blanks left for the 
purpose, letters and words which had been elided. This is 
the now well-known “completion test.”” The dashes for 
omitted words, syllables, and letters were to be filled out in 
such a way as to make sense. In the construction of this 
test the author asked himself the questions, What is the 
principal function that characterizes an/ intelligent act?
-P-A-G-E-126
  
aD 
       12 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
In what especially is an intelligent person distinguished from 
an unintelligent one? He concluded that it is not in mere 
memory. To be a good physician, for instance, it does not 
suffice merely to have a good memory for facts; one must be 
able to organize all present symptoms and other data in such 
a way as to deduce from them an exact diagnosis, and to 
combine them in such a way as to picture accurately to him- 
self just what is wrong with the patient? This function he 
called “combination,” and he regarded it therefore as an 
important element in intelligence. To test this ability he 
devised the completion test, in which the subject is required 
from the general context to determine just what the missing 
elements should be.! 
While Ebbinghaus was doubtless right in the main as to, 
the importance of the combining function in intelligence, it 
is undeniable that it does not necessarily involve certain 
elements which are very important for success in difficult 
pursuits. Results of these tests, however, showed the com- 
pletion test to be markedly superior to the other two tests 
used. The children were grouped according to age, and those 
in each class were also divided into three equal groups accord- 
ing to whether their scholastic standing was good, average, 
or poor. With respect to age, all three tests showed superi- 
ority of old over young students, but the memory of digits 
and the completion test showed the greatest differences 
with advancing ages of groups, the latter test showing of the 
two, however, the greater regularity of increase in scores. 
Comparing the scores of the three divisions of each class, 
Ebbinghaus found that no reliable differences between bright,

the blanks with words or parts of words as needed to make good sense;

there, so that --- ---- lo- — — — yellow instead of — - -- - .” This is 
part of a test, slightly modified, for advanced students. It is obvious that the| 
value of such a test depends on the nature of the elisions made in the text used.

Sensory and Particular Tests 113 
average, and dull groups were made by scores on the memory 
span of digits, and that the calculation test had shown but a 
slight superiority of the best groups in each grade. The 
completion test, however, showed a clear superiority of the 
best over the median, and of the median over the poorest 
groups. Thus, though the mathematical correlation method 
was not used at this time, Ebbinghaus found a high degree of 
correspondence between scores in the completion tests and 
degree of intelligence as obtained by the two criteria used. 
We need only add that this completion test, which certainly 
calls into play higher and complex mental functions, has 
proved to be one of our very best intelligence tests, though 
its value depends much on a proper selection of words or 
letters to be omitted and on the extent to which the con- 
structive imagination is really brought into play. The test 
may be made discouragingly difficult and be reduced too 
much to guessing, if too many elisions are made. If too 
few are made for the degree of intelligence of the subjects 
tested, it becomes merely a speed test. The results of Eb- 
binghaus’ test, then, while they still left open the question of 
atigue effects, were a clear demonstration of the essential 
correctness of Binet’s contention for the superior value in 
individual psychology of complex tests as opposed to tests 
f simple functions.     
            
   
       
          
          
    
     USES OF SOME EARLY TESTS IN AMERICA 
Thus while some evidence in favor of Binet’s contention 
as derived from studies of the complex mental processes, 
he results of various studies of the simpler processes were 
in nearly all cases negative, so far as individual testing is 
mcerned. It should, however, be emphasized that inves- 
igations in America like those of Thorndike (211) on fatigue 
m 1900 and by Thorndike and Woodworth (218) on transfer 
ffects of training, published in the following year, were  
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ies on tests of a kind that have been of great value in 
analytical investigations of intelligence and in group com- 
parisons. To the genius of Thorndike in particular is due 
the Grigin or adaptation of various tests, usually of supposed 
special functions, which have been used in valuable re- 
searches. In the first of the studies here named the mental 
al alieation test appeared. Adaptations of old tests — 
the memory of series of numbers, of nonsense syllables, of 
geometrical figures of various forms; the crossing out of 
words containing certain specified letters, as e and ¢ — were 
also made for this study, while in the investigation of transfer, 
the cancellation test, just referred to, a test that owes its 
origin to Bourdon and which was used also by Oehrn and by 
Cattell and Farrand, was further modified to include the 
crossing out of words of a given length, of certain parts of 
speech, and so on. In the study on the interrelations of 
certain perceptive and associative processes by Thorndike 
and Aikins (2) in 1902, the cancellation test was also em- 
cre as well as certain controlled association tests —    
                          
       
                   
     
    opposites, part-whole, and genus-species — elaborated in 
Columbia University; and in his Educational Psychology, 
first published in 1903, Thorndike made extensive use of these 
several tests and many others, such as memory of related| 
words, an alphabet test requiring the subject to. write the 
letters which in the alphabet precede those given, and paper 
maze tests for motor ability. On the basis of scores made in} 
these several tests he pointed out the advantages of quan. 
titative methods in studies of individual differences, relation: 
ship ean various mental functions, relative effects o} 
nature and nurture, etc. In fact, Columbia Universit 
nat e a center of scientific work in mental testing; but th 
emp asis was largely on the measurement of special function: 
in studies such as have been indicated, not on the testing o 
individuals for general intelligence or general mental ability.

Sensory and Particular Tests 115 
The study of sex differences by Helen B. Thompson (210), 
carried out in the University of Chicago from 1898 to 1900, 
employed, in addition to certain sensory acuity and dis- 
crimination and memory tests, a test in the rapidity of asso- 
ciation in responses to ten given words, a general information 
test of 25 questions, five ingenuity tests, motor-ability tests, 
and certain experiments on the affective processes. The 
ingenuity tests were: a test in which the subject was to 
remove three of fifteen matches arranged to form five squares 
with a view to leaving only three squares and no extra 
matches, a sort of checkerboard problem which required the 
subject to arrange eight “men” on the board so that no two 
were on the same straight line in any direction, two mechan- 
ical-ability tests requiring the comprehension and operation 
of a piece of light-discrimination apparatus and of a simple 
combination lock, and an arithmetic problem in which the 
subject was to find how fast a man can swim in still water if 
he swims three times as fast down a stream running one mile 
an hour as up the stream. The extent of the group dif- 
ferences found and their unreliabilities were not determined, 
but the tests gave indications of sex differences in certain 
respects. The men, for example, excelled in strength, 
rapidity, and ease of movement, and in the ingenuity tests, 
while the women seemed to be superior in certain sensory- 
discrimination tests and memory. 
No means of determining the diagnostic value of the tests 
as to general intelligence were, however, developed in these 
early Chicago and Columbia studies. It is obvious that 
some of the Thompson tests can hardly be supposed to meas- 
ure only particular abilities.

  CHAPTER SEVEN 
Tue HistoricaL BACKGROUND OF THE BinET-Simon Tests 
BINET’S PREPARATION AND EARLY WORK 
Tue adverse results as to intelligence testing, described in 
the previous chapter, did not, of course, stop the testing 
movement. Numerous special studies, both of physical 
and of particular mental processes, were carried out in the 
last decade of the nineteenth and in the beginning of this 
century, before the intelligence scales, now so well known, 
took shape. Of these investigations Binet was not neglect- 
ful; indeed, he was one of the most energetic workers in 
carrying out these various studies. This is particularly 
true in regard to the studies, of whatever nature, that were 
devised to throw light on individual differences or to trace 
relationships of physical characters and intellectual functions. 
Binet at one time studied medicine and was especially 
interested in abnormal psychology, an interest that would 
_ be expected to result from contact with men like his instruc- 
tors, Charcot and Féré. During this period he wrote on the 
psychical life of microérganisms, on reasoning, on “animal 
magnetism,”’ and on diseased or dissociated personalities 
(15, 14, 47, 16). In 1890 he became adjunct director of the 
laboratory of physiological psychology at the Sorbonne, 
Paris, along with Professor Beaunis, and later he became, 
and remained during all the rest of his life, the director of 
this laboratory. His thesis for the doctorat és sciences, which 
he received in 1894, was on aspects of the nervous system in 
insects (17). He tells us that in the decade following 1887, 
when he gave up abnormal psychology, the larger part of his 
experiments were made in the schools of Paris and its suburbs 
(66, page 5). Under these conditions the carefulness of 
scientific technique, characteristic of studies in psychological 
: 117 
Ji e

  118 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
laboratories on but a few experienced subjects, had to be 
sacrificed in a measure for the more practical conditions found 
in the schools. He gives interesting accounts of attempts in 
this early period to experiment on and study different classes 
of people with a view to the determination of individual 
differences. ‘ 
EARLY EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF MEMORY AND IMAGINATION 
The attention of Binet and his collaborators was early 
directed toward memory and creative imagination. He 
studied the creative imagination of dramatic authors and 
the memories and imagery of blindfolded chess players, who 
play as high as six to eight games at once, and of great cal- 
culators (18, 19, 48, 55, 56). A number of psychologists 
had already made thorough studies of memory by means of 
scientific methods. Some of these earlier studies of memory 
and of imagery, as well as his own studies, are reviewed by 
Binet in a book on experimental psychology (20, Chapters 5, 
6), published in 1894. 
As early as 1885 Ebbinghaus had published results of a 
study in which he worked out certain valuable methods of 
investigating memory (110), and nine years later Miiller 
and Schumann (165) had reported results of an extended 
study along the same line, in which they had elaborated and 
improved upon the technique of Ebbinghaus. These methods 
were, however, ill adapted to the practical testing of children 
as to memory ability. As early as 1887 Jacobs (138) had 
devised and used a method of measuring the “span of pre- 
hension,” which was easily applicable to practical use,svith 
groups, and which has consequently been widely used/ His 
method was to measure how many letters and digits could 
be correctly reproduced after two auditory presentations, 
with an interval of about one-half second between each two 
successive letters or digits in the series. He began with
-P-A-G-E-133
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 119 
short series, easy to grasp, and increased the length of the 
series in successive trials until the subjects were unable to 
repeat all the members. This method differs from one of 
those used by Ebbinghaus — “retained members” — and 
later by Pohlmann (176) in that in the latter case the series 
is too long for retention immediately after one or two repeti- 
tions. The subject by Ebbinghaus’ method is given several 
repetitions and is then required to reproduce as many mem- 
bers of the series as he can. Either of these methods is 
readily adapted to practical testing requirements, and both 
are found in the Binet-Simon Scale later developed. Jacobs 
found the nonsense syllables of Ebbinghaus unsatisfactory 
because of distractions of attention and such variable factors 
as ease of pronunciation and audibility of the syllables. 
Jacobs’ results showed a slight increase in span with 
age and also with rank in the class; so he suggested that a 
“standard span” be added to the items then in use for an- 
thropological measurement. Galton in some notes supple- 
mentary to this report says that, using the method of Jacobs, 
he had found greater variation in prehension but a more 
limited average span in idiots than in normal children. Bol- 
ton, as we have already seen (supra, page 84), used the 
memory-span method in the early nineties and obtained 
results similar to those of Jacobs. He also applied the 
method to problems of fatigue, of sex differences, of the influ- 
ence on any digit of relative position in the series, and of the 
effects of such factors as practice and attention. 
Several other studies of memory developed methods suit- 
able to apply to school children, or suggestive of means for 
such application. Miinsterberg and Bigham (167) carried out 
experiments in which series of either ten or twenty numbers, 
colors, geometrical forms, words of two consonants and an 
intervening vowel, and nonsense syllables were presented to a 
number of subjects simultaneously under controlled con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ditions and were to be reproduced by the several subjects in 
a manner to determine the effects of different forms of pres- 
entation, as visual and auditory, or a combination of these. 
The influence of different time intervals between presenta- 
tion and recollection was also investigated. 
MEMORY TESTS APPLIED TO SCHOOL CHILDREN 
Kirkpatrick (146) presented to different groups of students 
varying in scholastic standing from the third grade to college, | 
series of ten words and of ten objects. One series of names of 
common objects was read, another was presented visually, 
and under similar conditions series of objects were visually 
presented. Both immediate recollection and recollection 
after three days were required. The memory of objects seen 
was found to be very much superior to that of the names 
of objects; and in the case of the latter, visual presentation 
gave better results than auditory presentation. The sub- 
jects were able to recognize, when present among other words, 
nearly twice as many words as they could recall. In general, 
and this point is most important from our present standpoint, 
memory improved slightly with successively higher school 
grades. 
Bourdon (73) experimented on 104 students who varied 
in age from eight to twenty years, with the idea of finding 
the influence of age on immediate memory. To each subject 
separately were read series of digits, of letters, and of words 
of one, two, and three syllables, of which the subject was 
immediately to reproduce as many members in each case as 
possible. Only small gains with increasing age were 
found in the reproductions, these being hardly noticeable, 
if at all present, for ages of fourteen to twenty years. He 
found, however, that there appeared to be a close agreement 
between immediate memory and that which is ordinarily 
called intelligence, a result that was in accord with the
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 121 
earlier work of Jacobs and Galton. This agreement between 
intelligence and immediate memory was especially marked 
when only extreme cases of intelligence (the very bright and 
the very dull) were considered — cases, the author points 
out, on which errors in classification as to intelligence would 
be improbable. 
To this beginning in the way of tests of memory Binet and 
his associates added a number of contributions. In 1894 he 
and Henri (49) published results of a study in which indi- 
vidual tests were given to 300 children of the primary schools 
of Paris, varying in ages from seven to thirteen years. Two 
methods, recognition and reproduction, were used in the 
memory of lines of varying length — presented, of course, 
visually. By the first method the lines shown were, after 
five seconds, to be recognized in a series of lines of increasing 
lengths, while in the second method the subjects were to 
draw lines the lengths of those seen. It was found that 
ability in the tests increased regularly with age, the younger 
children overestimating the lengths of very short lines (1.5 
and 4 mm.) and underestimating those of the longer lines 
(16, 40, and 68 mm.) more than did the older ones, but the 
errors of all the subjects were in the directions here stated. 
These studies led later to investigations of suggestibility. 
In this same year appeared reports of experiments by the 
same authors on the memory of words and of sentences 
(61, 52). These reports are of considerable importance 
historically because of the rather extensive use of the memory 
of sentences made in the later intelligence scales by Binet 
and Simon. The authors emphasize the importance of 
verbal memory, not only as the chief foundation of instruc- 
tion but as a basic factor in all forms of language, both written 
and oral. The experiments were carried out as group tests 
on 380 boys in the schools of Paris, ranging in ages from 
eight to thirteen years. Unrelated words, such as dog,
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ladder, virtue, etc., were arranged in series of increasing 
lengths (of from five to nine words) and were pronounced to 
the children by the director of the school, after he had 
thoroughly explained the procedure to be followed and had 
announced in advance, in each case, the number of words in 
the series. The children were to reproduce in writing as 
many of the words in each series as possible. The experi- 
ment was also given in modified forms, individually, to ten 
adults. 
Slightly more words were retained by the children in the 
long than in the short series, and no effect of age was found 
in the primary schools in which the ages ranged from seven 
to twelve years. The authors supposed that under the con- 
ditions of the test the effect of age may have been concealed, 
but they admit that within the age limits investigated such 
effect is probably small. The span of the adults was found 
to be somewhat larger than that of the children (average 
5.7 as compared with 4.7), this difference being probably due 
to the fact that the adults were capable of a greater “energetic 
effort of attention” (page 9). Evidence was found in some 
studies on adults with very long series that meaning is in- 
fluential in retention, a fact that was early, and is now 
generally, recognized. : 
BINET REJECTS ASSOCIATION AS THE BASIS OF REVIVAL 
IN MEMORY 
Revival in memory is usually explained on the principle 
of association by contiguity and resemblance, but “in 
reality,” these authors assert, “those who take the pains to 
make observations of facts (d’aprés nature) will perceive 
that the principles of association do not account for all the 
phenomena — far from that; and we propose to show, @ 
propos of our experiments on verbal memory, the existence 
of an entirely different mental operation, which is explained
-P-A-G-E-137
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 123 
neither by contiguity nor by resemblance” (page 21). They 
find that while words may come up by association principles, 
recall is in some cases made by sheer effort with apparently 
no association. Vaschide came to similar conclusions from a 
study of localization in recollection (225). This process of 
recall independent of association Binet and Henri held to be 
not a special but a general phenomenon in memory, being 
present to some degree in all cases of recall; it involves a 
directing of the attention and of the will toward the experi- 
ences that have taken place, with a view to recalling them. 
“*We have an idea of the whole of the experience, an idea that 
is very vague since the words learned do not always have 
among them an analogy of sense; but all the words have 
the common character of constituting part of the same ex- 
perience, of having been learned together, of having been 
pronounced by one and the same person. They form a whole, 
and we are able to fix our attention on this whole” and thus 
voluntarily to call out its several parts (page 23). This is 
how, according to the testimony of different persons, repro- 
duction of memories is effected. “It appears, indeed, that 
the direction of attention is the primordial condition of it.” 
Thus for Binet attention comes to play a very important 
réle in the manifestations of intelligence, a subject to which 
we shall recur presently. 
ORIGIN AND USES OF THE MEMORY-OF-SENTENCES METHOD 
While the memory of isolated words was not a new field, 
having been studied, as we have seen, by Miinsterberg and 
Bigham, and also by Calkins (84), Binet and Henri say that 
in their study of the memory of sentences they enter upon a 
field entirely unexplored (page 25). These experiments 
were carried out on 510 children in the elementary schools of 
Paris. The method was the same as that used with words. 
In each case the short piece of prose to be reproduced was 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
124 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
read by the teacher of the children in the presence of Binet 
and Henri, after the subjects had been explicitly instructed 
to attend for purposes of reproduction in writing. This 
particular orientation of attention the authors regarded 
as of much importance. Prose selections varying from eleven 
to eighty-six words were used, and the number of ideas re- 
produced was determined for each selection by marking the 
selection off into its several ideas and checking in the repro- 
ductions all the ideas found.!_ Here is an example of a short 
selection of twenty words divided into eight ideas by the 
authors of this study : 
Le petit Emile |a obtenu | de sa mére | un joli | cheval 
mécanique | en récompense | de sa bonne conduite | a l’école. |   
The authors show in numerous graphs and tables that 
attention is not evenly distributed over the words of the 
sentences dictated, and that the ideas getting most attention 
are best retained. While these results come out clearly in 
the group studies, they could not be obtained with individual 
tests since distracting factors would vary. The authors 
claim to have discovered in this experiment a method of 
measuring the mean relative intensities of several states of 
consciousness, and they enthusiastically characterized their 
method as “a dynamometer of attention” (page 44). Com- 
paring the reproductions of sentences by children of different 
ages and classes with those of isolated words, the comparisons 
often being rather crude, the authors conclude that the 
verbal memory of sentences is about twenty-five times 
superior to the memory of isolated words. Words that do 
not give any precise significance to the tho ght of the sen- 
tence are poorly remembered, this being true irrespective 
of their meanings individually considered. In the case of 
1 For this and other methods of studying memory and data obtained by 
the different methods, the reader is referred to Whipple, Manual of Mental 
and Physical Tests.
-P-A-G-E-139
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 125 
isolated words there is but little time to attend to any single 
word before the next one comes to crowd it out. 
Only a slight tendency is shown in the results of this experi- 
ment for the number of reproduced ideas to increase with 
successively older groups, or with higher classes of children, 
but the authors did not consider all the data that were ob- 
tained; they selected for study only thirty-three to forty- 
four representative children of each class. It should be 
noted, however, that the average ages of the lowest (9 years) 
and of the highest (12 years) of the five classes compared 
differed by only three years. The differences in the average 
productions of the several classes were “small but constant.” 
That Binet attached very great, doubtless too great, impor- 
tance to these memory tests as indicators of general intelli- 
gence is evident from the large use that he made of them 
later in his intelligence scale. While Ebbinghaus had criti- 
cized memory tests adversely as measures of individual 
difference in mental ability, Binet favored them for two 
reasons: (1) memory involves content of the higher mental 
functions, not mere sensations, and (2) by means of memory 
tests one can indirectly study the operations and nature of 
such higher mental processes as discrimination, attention, 
and intelligence, as well as the interests, tastes, and generali- 
zations of the individual (23, page 297). 
Binet’s memory-of-sentences method was used by Shaw 
(189) in a study in Worcester, Massachusetts, published two 
years after the appearance of the report by Binet and Henri. 
Shaw makes no reference whatever to the French publication, 
but his work was done under the direction of G. Stanley 
Hall, who had evidently read the report in the Année. The 
method of conducting the experiment and of tabulating the 
results is precisely that used by Binet and his collaborator. 
Shaw tested something over seven hundred students, selected 
in such a manner as to leave, after discarding papers of
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
students who for various reasons had not responded correctly 
to the instructions, at least fifty papers from each sex in each 
of the following grades: the third, the fifth, the seventh, the 
tenth, and the twelfth. Any excess papers by either sex in 
any grade were reduced to this number by a chance process. 
He also tested fifty seventh-grade students by the visual 
method, the student reading from a typed sheet, and in addi- 
tion he tested by the regular method twenty students of 
Clark University and thirty of Miss Aiken’s school at Stam- 
ford, Connecticut, making in all seven hundred students 
whose papers were considered. It was found that some 
facts were well and others poorly remembered by all groups, 
the variations agreeing markedly in all the groups tested. 
While no important sex differences appeared, there was a 
constant increase in the average number of words reproduced 
by children from the third grade up to the tenth, inclusive. 
“One of the most striking facts brought out,” says the 
author, “was the early age at which children reach approxi- 
mately their maximum memory power” (page 64). Un- 
fortunately the average ages of the several groups are not 
given, but it appears that the maximum memory ability 
was reached at about sixteen years. 
TESTS OF SUGGESTIBILITY 
Their study of the memory of lines, as we have already 
noted, led Binet and Henri into an investigation of the 
effects of suggestibility. In 1894 they report (48) results of 
an investigation on school children of the first three grades, 
with ages ranging from 7 to 9 years, 9 to 11 years, and 11 to 
18 years, respectively. Three lines of different lengths were 
successively shown each child individually, and after a short 
time interval a chart of lines of regularly increasing lengths 
was presented tohim. From this chart he was then to select 
lines equal in length to those which he had previously seen,
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 127 
called the models. The test was then repeated with the 
difference, however, that this time the five longest lines, 
including the one equal to the third model shown the child, 
were lacking in the chart now used. Children who had the 
first time selected for line three a length shorter than those 
now left out were excluded from this test. Of the first-grade 
children 88 per cent, of the second-grade 60 per cent, and of 
the third-grade 47 per cent yielded to the suggestion and chose 
for model three, lengths still on the second (incomplete) 
chart. Whereas in these experiments the children were 
compelled to rely on memory in the comparisons, they were 
now in a third experiment permitted to see during the com- 
parison both the model line and the lines on the charts in 
the order in which the charts were previously used. In 
this case only the longest of the three models was used. 
Errors were now considerably reduced, and there was more 
assurance and less timidity shown by the children. 
Now another interesting modification of the experiment 
was tried. A line 40 mm. long was shown the child, with 
the request that he choose from a chart as before a line to 
match it, the comparison being first by memory and then 
by direct perception, as already explained. But now, at the 
moment of the child’s choice, the experimenter said in a 
calm, even voice, without any gesture, “Are you quite 
sure you are right?”’ The result of this suggestion was that 
of the first-grade children in the memory comparison 98 per 
cent, of the second 80 per cent, and of the third 54 per cent 
hesitated and changed their selection; while in the direct 
comparison the corresponding percentages were 74, 73, and 
48. Thus not only were the younger children again found 
more ready to yield to the suggestion, but it turned out also 
that those who were most accurate in the first experiments 
changed their selections much less often under the caution 
by the experimenter than did the other children. What is  
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
particularly interesting is that, of those in this experiment 
who changed their selection on account of the caution, 81 
per cent changed it for the better and only 19 per cent for 
the worse, this greater accuracy under the caution being true 
both for the memory and for the direct comparisons. 
Suggestion in experiments on small groups of children 
collectively was also tried. Four children at a time were 
allowed to see simultaneously the model and the chart, and 
were asked to say, all together, which line equaled the model. 
In this case the children usually did not all respond at once; 
so the slower ones were thus influenced by the answers of 
the quicker ones. It was found that the younger children 
were influenced to a much greater degree by the early 
answers than were the older children, yet effects of this sort 
of suggestibility were found to some extent in all the grades 
tested. 
Ficurr 1 
The reader will note that line a in Figure 1 appears to be 
longer than line 6, although the lines are equal, as measure- 
ment will show. This is the well-known Miiller-Lyer illu- 
sion. a looks longer than b because the small lines at its 
ends point outward so as to lead the observer unconsciously 
to make a wider sweep of eye-movements and to take note 
somehow of a wider space than is necessary in the case of b. 
By an arrangement of figures on the right-hand leaves of 
an album, so that lines of different lengths could be} 
readily compared successively with another figure, Binet (21) 
studied the Miiller-Lyer illusion effects on the perception of 
sixty school children of an average age of 12 years, and o'
-P-A-G-E-143
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 129 
forty-five of an average age of 9 years. He found that the 
illusion is stronger in the younger than in the older children, 
though individual variations were marked. 
It is interesting to compare these results with those ob- 
tained by Dresslar (107) in experiments of a somewhat dif- 
ferent kind carried out a little earlier. Dresslar studied the 
relations of the size-weight illusion — the tendency to per- 
ceive large objects as lighter than smaller objects of the same 
actual weight — to intelligence. The 173 children tested 
ranged in ages from 7 to 14 years, and were classified by their 
teachers into three groups — “bright,” “good,” and “dull.” 
While the illusion was found to be constant throughout this 
range of ages, instead of being more marked in the dull 
children, as had been expected, it turned out that “The more 
intelligent the children, other things being equal, the stronger 
are the associations between the ideas! of size and weight of 
a giyen material” (page 462). 
aint and his collaborators carried out various other 
xperiments on suggestibility, and in 1900 he published a 
volume of nearly four hundred pages on his experiments on 
this subject (30). Much work on suggestion had been done 
in France and elsewhere by means of hypnotism, but Binet 
presented his facts independently of these data and of other 
studies on pathological conditions. Rejecting the loose use 
lof the term “suggestion,” current at that time and even in 
ur own day to some extent, he regarded the true meaning 
f this term to be a moral pressure of one individual, or of 
everal individuals, on another, tending to produce an auto- 
atic state of mind. Moral is here used in the broad sense 
f the term common to French psychologists. Suggestion 
n this view may be effected through fear, love, charm, 
ntimidation, respect, admiration, etc. The tests whose 
esults are considered in this volume are, besides those on

suggestion already considered, one dealing with the effect 
of a certain suggestion on weight discrimination, one on how 
by questions a judge may influence the witness, and one on 
the influence toward continuing certain subconscious move- 
ments automatically, once they have been started with the 
rhythm of a metronome whose movements the subject was 
to see and continue to count. Simple writing movements 
ta likewise studied. 
Simon, who was a student under Binet, published in 1900 
a study on defectives (192) in which he carried into the 
abnormal field the work on suggestion which had been de- 
veloped on normal subjects. Using the same methods that 
Binet had used on normal children, he applied a number of 
Binet’s tests to twenty-seven defectives from the Vaucluse 
asylum. He found that the subjects were classified by the 
tests in a manner largely similar to that determined with 
normal children, except that a bizarre type appeared with 
reactions that were very irregular and indefinite, and that 
the lower imbeciles were wholly beyond suggestibility. There 
was, then, less suggestibility in the subnormal than in the 
normal children. 
DESCRIPTION-OF-OBJECTS AND DESCRIPTION-OF-PICTURES 
TESTS 
Whi of the means that Binet used in measuring the subject’s 
higher complex processes, and one that was put to service i 
his description-of-pictures test in the later intelligence scale, 
was the description of an object (23). Binet says that a: 
early as 1893 he and Henri had carried out experiments wit 
this test in a primary school. A complex picture was show: 
to a class of children, and two minutes later the childre 
were to describe in writing from memory what they ha 
seen. For this writing a ten-minute period was allowed. 
The cards and results were put aside for a time due to occupa:
-P-A-G-E-145
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 131 
tion with other researches. In the meantime Binet dis- 
covered that Miss Bryant (80) had used a similar method in 
her more complex description-of-a-room test, much earlier 
than this. 
Binet reports results of group tests applied to 175 children 
ranging in ages from 8 to 14 years. Five copies of the same 
picture were used in a room, and the students were grouped so 
that they could each see one of the pictures. A control group 
of twelve subjects was then given ten minutes to describe 
the same picture, which in this case remained before them 
while they wrote. Thus was determined just what, in the 
memory reproductions, was actually due to retention or 
memory and what to the selectiveness of attention. It was 
found, however, that many of the subjects in the smaller 
control group observed only for a period of from one and one 
half to two minutes and then wrote the rest of the time 
without further reference to the picture. Others looked at 
it again at the end of the writing, evidently to verify what 
they had written. The number of lines of descriptive 
matter was counted — a poor criterion, no doubt — and was 
found to increase with age, but not rapidly. Most subjects 
stopped writing before the end of the ten-minute period. 
It was also found, both in the memory and in the observa- 
tion reproductions, that objects are noted according to their 
importance to the child. The nature of the child more than 
that of the objects determines the selection, said Binet. The 
observation reports were in general only a little longer than 
the memory reports, and they gave more of the details of the 
pictures. Binet was impressed with the descriptions and 
classed the subjects, according to their dominant tendencies, 
into describers (who merely enumerate objects without being 
impressed with the events they portray), observers (who 
attend more to the part each object in the picture plays in 
the whole scene), the emotional type (who fill their descrip-
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
tions with sentiment, neglecting details), and the erudite or 
learned type (who give a story about the picture). These 
differences were corroborated in a similar experiment on 
adult subjects. 
After making his classification of the subjects into these 
various types, Binet attempted to determine whether his 
subjects of the emotional type really were emotional in 
practical-life conditions or whether they showed this type 
of reaction only under the conditions of the experiment and 
as a result of past training for such specific situations. He 
found in the estimates of the children by their teachers that 
of five students who had been classed with the emotional 
type, four were characterized by their teachers as of a 
frigid character, a dry nature! This was, of course, not a 
very adequate test of the validity of the classification, for 
the teachers’ estimates may themselves be wrong, and also 
the number of cases is entirely inadequate. It is significant, 
however, that though Binet makes much use of the descrip- 
tion-of-an-object test in his later intelligence scales, the 
“emotional type” does not occur in his classification of the 
responses. | 
It will be recalled that Ferrari published, in the year be- 
fore the one that brought the article by Binet, an account of 
an experiment on the description of pictures of actors shown 
in successive stages of an act. Leclére (156) two years later 
made seven classes of the responses which he obtained by 
showing a watch to a class of thirty girls varying in ages from 
13 to 17 years, and asking them to write what was “sug- 
gested” by the object, and he was led to believe from his 
results that the papers furnished a fair measure of the mental 
development of persons at that age, as compared with 
younger or older subjects.

EXPERIMENTS ON RELATIONS OF CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL 
PROCESSES TO MENTAL WORK 
While Binet had taken a very definite stand on the superior 
value for “individual psychology” of the testing of complex 
mental processes, he nevertheless devoted much of his time 
to physical tests. His early work in abnormal psychology 
would naturally connect up with the study of such physio- 
logical processes as circulation and blood pressure. In a 
review of Dumas’ article on joy and sadness (108) Binet (25) 
shows in 1897 a broad practical acquaintance with circulatory 
phenomena, and refers to methods used in his own laboratory 
in physiological researches. He points out the error made 
by Dumas and all previous writers in assuming that the 
coldness of the extremities after prolonged intellectual work 
and the discoloration of the tissues are indications of vaso- 
constriction. A slow pulse and lessened dicrotism very high 
up on the line of oblique ascension shows instead, he points 
out, a general lowering of organic vitality; so conclusions 
as to vaso-constriction without a study of the force of the 
capillary pulse are not reliable. 
In the same year appears an article in an American journal 
by Binet and Vaschide (65), criticizing the method used by 
Kiesow and others, and showing that only with a certain 
properly selected counter pressure on the fingers studied 
does one find an increased pulsation with mental calculation. 
(Kiesow’s negative results are shown to be due to a failure to 
take note of this factor. In this study, however, only one 
subject is used, and the statistical treatment is inadequate. 
Several more lengthy articles by Binet and his associates, 
ion the influence of intellectual work, of the emotions, and of 
hysical work on the heart action and the blood pressure, 
s well as on changes in these bodily processes with different 
ours of the day, were published in the Année of 1897 and
-P-A-G-E-148
  134 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
in subsequent volumes. It was determined that the effect 
of intellectual work, of talking vigorously for a period of three 
minutes, of physical exertion, of excitation of the senses, and 
of the physical arousal of pain was in each case increased 
blood pressure, but other bodily changes were not all alike 
under these various circumstances. With joy and sadness 
increased blood pressure was also found. The effect of the 
meals at midday and evening was to accelerate the pulse and 
to raise the temperature of the hands and armpits. The 
influence of these changes on performance in a mental test 
was not, of course, and has never been, determined.     
     
     
               
   
          THE FRENCH AND THE GERMAN METHODS OF INVESTIGATING 
MENTAL FATIGUE 
It is interesting to note that studies in mental work and 
mental fatigue in the latter part of the nineties differed 
materially in France on the one hand and in Germany on the 
other as to methods. In the former country, largely under 
the leadership of Binet, the method was physiological and 
indirect, attempting to find physiological changes and sen- 
sibility changes indicative of, or correlating with, the mental 
fatigue; whereas in Germany the method was direct and 
attempted to measure the actual amount of mental work 
accomplished in equal lengths of time before and during 
mental fatigue, as well as the accuracy of such work. Neither 
of these methods, however, seems to have been very success- 
ful or productive of trustworthy results, for we are still in 
ignorance concerning many essential aspects and results of 
mental fatigue. We have not yet sufficiently controlled 
all the relevant factors in experiments on fatigue. A review 
of the early investigations of fatigue is given in Binet an 
Henri’s book on intellectual fatigue (54).

BINET ON MEASUREMENT IN INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY 
In 1898 an important article by Binet appeared in the 
Revue Philosophique (27), in which he discusses measurement 
in individual psychology and gives us a good idea of the 
problems and methods on which he was working at that time. 
He points out that there is little value in studying intelligence 
and character traits if we confine ourselves only to descrip- 
tior without measurement, however rough and approxi- 
ma. e this latter may have to be. From illustrations of 
measurement in such special functions as visual acuity, two- 
point discrimination, and auditory acuity, which are rela- 
tively simple, he approaches the higher functions and raises 
the question, “But when we come to the measurement of 
intelligence, what method can we use? How can we measure 
the richness of inspiration, the accuracy of judgment, the 
ingenuity of the mind?” (page 113). Recognizing that a 
precise and satisfactory solution of this problem must await a 
broader experience, he limits himself to suggestions that have 
come to him while at work on the problem. He says that 
when forced to make evaluations of mental traits and abilities, 
he has had recourse to empirical and provisional procedures 
which, though very numerous, he groups for simplicity under 
two main heads: first, the measurement of results obtained 
while the conditions of the test are kept constant; second, 
making such gradations in the test as will reduce the results 
to the maximum of simplicity. 
Methods of measuring results obtained while the conditions 
of the test are kept constant. ‘ Several methods, more or less. 
precise, are included under the first head. The test may be 
136 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 137 
so arranged that the subject draws a line to match one shown 
him by the experimenter. The latter then announces that 
he will next expose to view a slightly longer line, which is 
likewise to be matched by drawing a line with its length 
parallel to the first one drawn. This time, however, the line 
shown is actually shorter. In this suggestibility test the 
results can be accurately measured in terms of length. 
Again, the results can be expressed as a definite number in 
tests of memory and of the rapidity of perception, consisting 
of a five-second exposure of fourteen familiar objects fastened 
to a large card and the recalling immediately afterward of 
the several objects, or in such cases as the description-of- 
an-object test, in which one counts the number of ideas of 
words. Measurements of the time required in certaiv per- 
formances, such as mental calculations, he suggests, are also 
widely applicable. ven it is impossible to make precise 
measurements, one /can often succeed in making gradations 
in the several responses. In the crudest case the test can 
either be passed or not passed. Tests of this sort, however, 
which permit of only two grades of answers can be given 
flexibility by the artifice of repetition of elements of the same 
degree of difficulty. Thus one may require the subject to 
reconstruct fifteen sentences of equal difficulty, of which the 
words have been disarranged, or to repeat, one at a time, 
fifteen numbers of six digits each. The responses are then 
objectively divided into sixteen grades, according to whether 
no success, or any number of successes up to fifteen, is 
obtained. 
An interesting example of the graded responses is the 
“morality test,” which Binet gave, under the guise of a 
literary test, to pupils in a primary school of Paris. A 
simple story is told of a child who by accident breaks a 
violin belonging to a comrade, and the pupils are asked each 
to write down what he would do if he were the owner of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  
138 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
violin. Binet classified the responses, about one hundred 
in number, into eight groups, making a scale of the degrees 
of severity shown as follows: 
1. Excuse the comrade, or take active steps to see that he | 
is not punished. 
2. Pardon him. 
3. Pardon him, expressing strong regret and sorrow. 
4. Reproach him, unless egoistic motives prevent this. 
5. Announce to the comrade that hereafter he cannot 
borrow anything. 
6. Ask a small indemnity, some sous. 
7. Make him pay the whole price of the violin. 
8% Seek to get revenge.on him. 
Binet points out that even though differences would 
doubtless arise as to classifications, the method is objective. 
He does not insist on its value as a morality test, this being a 
matter of interpretation, but is interested fundamentally in 
the method. Here, then, we see clearly the idea of a scale, 
but the reactions of all subjects are made to one and the same 
circumstance. 
In all such cases as the foregoing ones Binet preferred to 
leave off the arbitrary or the subjective elements and to 
develop a purely objective means of evaluation. He gives 
finally, also from his experiences, two examples of complex 
methods of measurement which he says have been very 
puzzling. The first is a method of measuring a person’s 
comprehension of a difficult text. A selection of five lines 
from John Stuart Mill’s Logic is used. In this test Binet 
shows his keen insight into human nature. He points out 
that to ask a subject to say what in the text he does not 
understand would be unsatisfactory and would serve to 
embarrass him; so he chooses the indirect method of having 
the subject read it over once and then reproduce in writing 
as much as he can remember of it, at least of the sense of the
-P-A-G-E-153
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 139 
passage. The selection is purposely so long that only those 
with remarkable memories can recall the words if they do 
not get the meaning. He reports that those who do not ~ 
understand the text either reproduce nothing at all or only 
a few words in fragments. By this indirect method Binet 
would measure the comprehension power of the subject and 
save his self-respect, not having him directly confess his 
inability to understand. He adds that subjects will generally 
say that they understood the passage perfectly well when it 
was read but forgot it before reproduction, for as La Roche- 
foucauld said, “A person will complain of his memory, but 
never of his judgment.” 
Now when these data — the subjects’ “ memories” — have 
been obtained, how can their several comprehensions be 
measured? Evidently not absolutely as one would meas- 
ure the length of a line with a ruler, or weigh something on the 
scales, but relatively ; that is, by classification of the subjects, 
according to the completeness of their reproductions," into 
two, three, or more groups. This is a measurement in the 
sense that it classifies the individuals, putting one ahead of 
another and behind a third one. In this respect the com- 
prehension test comes out to be similar to the morality test, 
and it was Binet’s hope that after a thorough study of the 
difficulties in the passage a scale like that of the latter might 
be arranged. 
The other complex test mentioned involves exactly the 
same difficulties of measurement as the one just considered. 
It is the well-known paper-cutting test, which later appeared 
in all three of the Binet-Simon intelligence scales. Binet 
here calls it a test of visual memory, and says that it was 
first suggested to him by Henri. The results are provi- 
sionally handled as in the comprehension test, although the 
goal of a scale comparable to that of the morality test is held 
in mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Measurement by gradations in the test itself. The second 
general procedure suggested in this article toward a method 
of measurement in individual psychology relates to a grada- 
tion in the test itself rather than in the results obtained with 
it, as illustrated above; and in this regard it comes nearer to 
the plan first adopted in the intelligence scale, in 1905, and 
retained to some extent in the later revisions; but the several 
units of the scales are made up almost completely of the first 
class of tests here illustrated by Binet. 
The most usual way of varying the test with the idea of 
reducing the results to the simplest form, as seen in Binet’s— 
own work, is to make it progressively more difficult until | 
the subject fails on it. To illustrate this method, a test of 
the memory of objects is described in this article. The 
subject is first shown a small number of objects, say three, 
for five seconds, and is then asked to write them down. 
Next he is shown for the same period of time four objects, 
then five, and so on, until a number is reached which he can- 
not retain completely. .The maximum number of objects 
remembered yields a simple, precise measure of the subject’s 
memory of this kind of content. This test resembles closely 
the digit-span test, also cited, which was first used by Jacobs, 
and which consists in reciting to the subject increasingly long 
series of digits to be reproduced. 
Two more examples are chosen, these from the study of 
motor skill. One is the now well-known steadiness test, 
then already in use by psychologists, in which the subject 
inserts a needle into successively smaller holes until the side 
of a hole is touched and indicated by some means, such as the 
making of an electric contact. The other test, originated 
by Binet to measure steadiness of hand and skill in the 
balancing of objects, consists in successively increasing the 
displacement of the center of gravity of a piece of apparatus| 
up to the point where the subject can no longer keep the! 
object in equilibrium.
-P-A-G-E-155
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 141 
Instead of giving a test in a form more and more difficult, 
one may repeat it without change until the subject has 
attained some definite goal in a learning process, or otherwise 
has arrived at some objective and easily determined end. 
This method is mentioned as especially applicable to various 
sorts of suggestibility experiments in which one, two, or 
three preliminary tests are given to create a habit, followed 
by a blank test to see how much of the suggestion of the 
preliminary tests is carried over. The example given is one 
of Seashore’s experiments. A white screen is illuminated 
in such a way that the intensity of illumination can be 
gradually lessened by pulling a cord. The subject, who 
thinks he is undergoing a test of perception, is to announce 
at what moment he becomes aware of the change in bright- 
ness. The test is made several times without deception, 
and then, by means of a special arrangement, the experi- 
menter pulls slowly on the cord as before, but now without 
causing any change in the lighting. The smaller the number 
of preliminary tests required to produce enough suggestion 
to cause the subject to announce a change when none takes 
place, the greater his suggestibility. Binet also tells us of 
attempts, then but recently made, to measure by a similar 
method the intensity of mental images; but the results were 
too uncertain for consideration. 
Several tests mentioned in this article were employed 
later by Binet and Simon in the construction of their intelli- 
gence scales, as the reader will see if he will examine in order 
the several tests of these scales. 
Binet closes with two general remarks. The first one is 
that measuring by any of the methods described, even though 
the results are expressed in precise figures, is not measure- 
ment in the physical sense of the term. When we measure 
the length of three beams of 6, 7, and 8 meters, respectively, 
we get differences which are equal in an absolute sense, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  
142 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
this is not true of psychological measurements because no 
absolute zero point is known. Thus if one subject scores 
6 digits, one 7, and one 8 in the digit-span test, we cannot 
say that the differences between the second and each of the 
other two are equal, or that the first subject is three fourths 
as good as the last. Attempts have been made since Binet’s 
day to determine an absolute-zero point in test scales, but 
with little success, and the cautions here given are still 
valuable. The second remark deals with qualitative dif- 
ferences in individuals, predisposing some of them toward 
literature and similar imaginative pursuits, others toward 
the sciences and callings which deal with the more stubborn 
realities of life. Certain individuals are endowed with very 
strong emotivities of different kinds — esthetic, moral, 
egoistic, etc. — and, Binet reminds us, it is a problem for 
the future to determine the various physical signs and mani- 
festations of these several types of personality. Individuals 
do not differ by degrees only ; this is the essence of the second 
remark.    
   
       
   
      
    
       ATTENTION AND ADAPTATION: RELATIONS TO INTELLIGENCE 
The year 1900 brought an article by Binet (29) on the 
subject ‘Attention and Adaptation,” the aim of which was 
not to find out what attention is, a question that he regarded 
as solved, but rather the very practical one of devising 
methods by which to measure the force of voluntary atten-| 
tion in any person. From a class of thirty-two children in| 
a primary school in Paris, he had the class teacher and th 
director of the school select for him the five ‘‘ most intelligent’ 
and the six “least intelligent,” and these children he studie 
carefully as to the force of their voluntary attention. Hi 
method of study was to give to these two groups of childre’ 
numerous tests, in a search for those which would prove mos' 
fit to measure voluntary attention. The tests that gav
-P-A-G-E-157
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 143 
about equal results for the two groups were rejected as bad, 
while those that showed up the greatest differences between 
these groups of children were regarded as good. The children 
averaged 10.7 years and 11.25 years of age for the “‘intelli- 
gent”’ and the “unintelligent”’ groups, respectively. 
Binet’s experiments on attention. The experimental work 
was rather extensive and involved the following tests: 
1. Tactile sensibility on the back of the hand together with 
effects of practice. 2. Simple and choice reaction times. 
8. Counting dots in groups of varying sizes and in series. 
4. Perception of changes in the rapidity of strokes made 
by a specially devised metronome. 5. Counting periodic 
sounds of five impulses per second. 6. Copying a long 
series of digits, an easy and a hard sentence, unrelated words, 
and a complicated design. In the case of digits, sentences, 
and words the number of digits or words for each look at the 
copy was noted; in the case of the design, which was com- 
posed entirely of straight lines, the number of acts of looking 
at the copy was recorded. The copying in this latter case 
could not be aided by “interior language,” so the number of 
acts varied from eight to sixteen. 7. Memory of letters and 
of numbers. 8. Quick perceptions, the test consisting of the 
reproduction of certain words after momentary exposures, 
and of the copying, after successive momentary exposures, 
of the Greek design now well known because of its use in the 
Binet-Simon scale. 9. The cancellation of letters from a 
printed page. Five letters were written at the top of the 
page and the subjects were to cross out as rapidly and 
accurately as possible all letters included in this group and 
occurring in the printed words. The experiment was then 
changed by designating five new letters to be crossed out, 
and later six letters, of which, however, only two were new. 
10. Simultaneous addition to three given numbers, 6-28-43. 
The subject was to write results of successive additions of
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
one to each number and continue with this process without 
seeing his figures, which were covered by the experimenter 
with a small card as soon as they were written. Thus he 
would write 7-29-44, 8-30-45, etc., both for speed and 
accuracy. 11. Speed in reading columns of twenty numbers 
formed by adding mentally the number one to each of a list 
of twenty numbers. The subject calls, for example, eight 
for seven. Also speed of counting two series of dots (test 3) 
and of copying sentences (test 6). The time taken to count 
dots and to copy a given sentence was noted for each subject, 
who, however, was not aware that he was timed. Thus his 
natural time was obtained. 
In all these experiments the tests were repeated once at 
least, generally more times, being modified in certain par- 
ticulars in the repetitions. 
What is attention? In the conclusion Binet tells us that 
after spending four months in the testing of attention he 
must still ask if it is really attention that he has measured, 
and he admits that he may be criticized for having missed 
the end that he started out to reach; for attention is not a 
thing on whose meaning all can agree as on that of memory 
or imagination. His own assumption has been “‘that atten- 
tion consists in a mental adaptation to a state that is new to 
us.” The idea was that of finding how persons of different 
degrees of intelligence differ in their reactions to conditions 
presenting difficulties. He avoided being involved in the 
usual dualistic speculations regarding voluntary attention, 
and admits that one may attempt to measure attention by 
means of tests very different from those employed by him — 
such, for instance, as the effects of distractions on mental 
work. The difficulties presented to the subject in Binet’s 
tests were intended to be difficulties not of reason or of com- | 
prehension but of adjustment to a situation that is of such a 
nature that the errors committed depend on the mental con- 
stitution of the subject and not simply on his good will.
-P-A-G-E-159
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 145 
How Binet selected the best tests for his purpose. Now, 
having results on the two groups differing in estimated in- 
telligence, he is able to ascertain which ones of the tests make 
the clearest discrimination between individuals as to their 
general mental ability. The tests which were found by this 
means to be of no value in making such discrimination are 
those of perception of increase or decrease in the strokes of a 
metronome, quick perception of words, reaction time, and 
speed of work. Binet says that he has arrived at the con- 
viction that speed in his tests has no relation to the intelli- 
gence of the several pupils (pages 390 and 396), but he is not 
willing to assert that this will be true in all tests. 
All the other tests showed clear discrimination between 
the group of intelligent and the group of unintelligent 
children. In the first test it was found that the children in 
the intelligent group, as he called it in contradistinction 
to the unintelligent group, showed much the finer tactile 
sensibility in the first trial, but they did not improve as much 
through successive trials as did the duller children. He 
believed, however, that this was due rather to a greater 
finesse of judgment than to a finer tactile sensibility. 
Binet discusses the several tests that made a clear difference 
between the two groups of children, considering their natural- 
ness, the sort of apparatus or materials necessary for their 
use in practical testing, and other points which add to or 
detract from their merit as intelligence tests. It is very clear 
that his main object is that of selecting valid and suitable 
intelligence tests, though in these experiments he has 
approached it through a study of attention as adaptation, 
which, as we have already seen, he now regards as an essential 
characteristic of intelligence. In the present article Binet 
devotes some space to the consideration of the influence of 
practice and habitude, and finds that his data show a much 
more rapid adaptation by the intelligent than by the un-
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
intelligent subjects. It is not improbable that these data 
and Binet’s opinion have influenced Stern in his definition 
of intelligence as a general power of adaptation. This ques- 
tion of the relation of quickness of adaptation to intelligence 
Binet hoped to treat more fully in later researches, but these 
researches were apparently never carried out. 
EFFECTS OF DISTRACTION ON ATTENTION 
The article is a long one and the work on it was doubtless | 
influential on his later activity of intelligence-scale con- 
struction. The report is followed by another, by the same 
author (28), in which he gives results of studies of tactual 
sensibility in two girls and a young man, the girls being his 
own daughters. Compass contacts on the back of the hand, 
as before, were made, while the subjects, as a means of dis- 
traction, were asked to add numbers and give aloud each 
progressive step. Results were now compared with similar 
discriminations made without such distraction. Differences 
were not very significant with respect to the problem inves- 
tigated, for it was discovered that subjects varied in the 
extent to which they tended to set up verbal automatisms 
and so to generalize their answers. Therefore the answers 
“one point” and “‘two point” did not express the actual 
degree of sensitiveness under these conditions of distraction. 
BINET’S “EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF INTELLIGENCE” 
Binet’s extensive testing of his two daughters, results of 
which were published in 1902 in a separate volume entitled 
The Experimental Study of Intelligence (34), was doubtless 
a most important step in his preparation for the later con- 
struction and establishment of the intelligence scale. In 
this book Binet characterizes the psychology of Fechner and 
Wundt as having borrowed from physiology its apparatus, 
its stimuli, and its methods. Attention has been given
-P-A-G-E-161
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 147 
mainly to material conditions of the experiment, and the réle 
of the persons serving as subjects has been reduced to the 
minimum. On the other hand, the new movement to which 
Binet has contributed with all his energy, with the collabora- 
tion of several of his students, especially of M. Henri, he 
tells us, consists in giving a larger place to introspection and 
in carrying the investigations into the higher mental phe- 
nomena, such as memory, attention, imagination, and the 
orientation of ideas. He then criticizes the narrower sense 
in which “stimulus” has been used, even by Ribot, and 
defines stimulus as not simply the application of a material 
excitant to our sense organs but as changes which the ex- 
perimenter provokes at will in the subject’s consciousness. 
He calls attention to the important and subtle réle of language 
as astimulus in this sense. Any stimulus, whether a physical 
object or a verbal symbol, he points out, produces a com- 
plexity of reactions, which continue in complicated forms 
for some time and of which the immediate sensation is but a 
small part. Instead of limiting the study to the sensations, 
one should take into account the larger and more far-reaching 
reactions of the individual, including the various aptitudes 
which they reveal. For this broader study no specifically 
new technique is necessary, but it is important to study not 
just the simple movements of the subject and the reports 
on the sensations experienced, ‘“‘but the whole group of reac- 
tions for which the individual is the stage” (page 4). 
Binet then proceeds to a very extensive qualitative analysis 
of his two daughters, Marguerite and Armande, 144 and 13 
years of age, respectively. A number of other subjects were 
also used to some extent. He begins with simple exercises, 
such as having each subject in separate sittings write a series 
of twenty words, just any words that come to mind. He 
notes the time, or the quickness, of these responses and 
studies the words given, going over the lists with the subject 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
so as to get their significance and their settings in the subject’s 
own thought; he notes the frequency of words referring to 
self and to things relating to self, to external objects, to recent 
and to remote memories, to fantasies; he follows up the 
various evidences of tendencies to neglect sense objects and 
to dwell on imaginary content, or the reverse; he studies 
vocabularies and interests as manifested in the words given; 
he investigates the connections between successive pairs of 
words, finding that a number of words in immediate succes- 
sion relate to some general ‘‘theme” and that changes of 
theme occur more often in the responses of the one subject 
than in those of the other; he quizzes the subjects gently 
and patiently on what lead from one word to the next. Day 
after day he studies new series of words. He rejects the laws 
of the associationist as adequate explanations of the con- 
nections between successive words. Sentences are called 
for in the same manner, and investigated in similar detail ; 
he observes the incipient movements of the subjects in writing 
these words and sentences, without letting them know that he 
is doing this, so that their reactions will be natural; he notes 
the exact time taken for deliberation before the writing of 
each of the sentences called for; and he traces out the 
various tendencies and natural dispositions of each subject 
as revealed in these various responses and corroborated in 
test after test, far beyond the point sufficient to satisfy one 
of less genius. 
Continuing his studies, he presents word after word to the 
subject, who is required to give the ideas and images sug- 
gested by each stimulus; he studies images, tendencies to 
subvocal speech, etc., in these young and inexperienced 
subjects, devoid of a knowledge of psychology and of its 
various theories of imageless thought, and concludes that 
images are not essential to thought. As many as sixty-seven 
pages are given in the book to images, with probably more
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 149 
attention to imageless thought than to the subjects’ charac- 
teristics. Whether meanings are general or particular is 
found to be determined not simply by the nature of the words 
given, but by the significance they have to the subject at the 
time and in the particular setting. He leads on further into 
the force of voluntary attention (as already given above in 
the consideration of distraction effects), and finds that atten- 
tion can be measured only with a group of tests, and not with 
any single test or device. The completion of sentences, 
the description of objects and of events, the evocation of 
various sorts of memories, and the development of themes — 
these are topics that are each studied in a similar intimate, 
natural, and thorough manner. The materials and methods 
used are the simplest; there is no apparatus of the showy 
and costly kind. As a consequence of this simplicity Binet 
has been charged with being unscientific, but his work is 
thorough, painstaking, and persistent; difficult things are 
attacked with the marvelous simplicity of a great artist, 
and tangled problems yield gradually as they are examined, 
turned over, and scrutinized from all angles by means of 
ever multiplying data. 
Finally he emerges with beautiful pictures of personality 
differences, not in terms of simple numbers or even of graphs, 
but in terms nevertheless so objective and so well verified 
that his results are in the main indisputable. Through all 
this search Binet has shown a master’s hand in discovering 
realities in human nature and in Jetting facts lead, rather than 
being determined by prejudices and theories. 
Marguerite he finds to be better oriented than Armande 
to the immediate, objective world, to be a good observer, 
to have a good literal memory; she is precise, preoccupied 
with things relating to herself, practical-minded; her atten- 
tion is regular and her effort constant; her images are defi- 
nite and intense, notwithstanding the obvious fact, as the
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
experiments show, that her involuntary imagery is poorly 
developed and that she has little aptitude for reverie. While 
her space perceptions are exact, those of temporal relations 
are poorly developed. The picture of Armande is very differ- 
ent. She is detached from the real world, imaginative, vague 
in her ideas, and has tendencies to verbalism. Her attention 
is inward, but yet not as much turned toward her immedi- 
ate self as is that of the older sister; it dwells on the more 
remote past, and on the future, and yet her images are faint | 
and poorly defined. Her involuntary imagery is well de- 
veloped, and she delights to live in a world of fancy. 
But these pictures are to Binet only a proof of his method; 
they show that individual psychology is possible, that simple 
tests in sufficient variety can discover individual differences. 
No attempt is made to evaluate the amount of intelligence, 
however. What a disappointment this study would be to 
those who ask merely how much in general! That was of 
course not the problem in this research, but Binet shows how 
much of value a thorough analysis of the several tendencies 
and traits can reveal. While his conditions for study were 
very good,—the sisters were his own daughters, — this 
study at least shows what is possible; it holds up an ideal as 
to qualitative results. It also gave Binet invaluable experi- 
ence for the work on the intelligence scale which was still 
before him, although in the latter case he came closer to the 
determination of quantitative differences in mentality. 
PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR RELATIONS TO 
INTELLIGENCE 
Binet and his collaborators carried out in the latter part 
in the nineties a large number of physical tests, with the idea 
of measuring “the physical force of an individual from a 
special point of view” (66, page 1). They attempted to 
measure separately certain aspects of physical strength
-P-A-G-E-165
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 151 
and then to determine what sort of correlations exist among 
these several physical qualities of an individual. They 
point out that while the testing of different physical traits 
had advanced a good deal, the study of intercorrelations 
among these traits had hardly passed its beginning stage. 
The reason for this unequal development of the study of the 
two aspects of physical traits was, in their view, that the 
measurement of traits does not require large numbers of 
subjects, whereas reliable correlations do require large 
numbers. They themselves did not know this latter fact 
in advance of their study, and found it out by their own mis- 
takes, for, alas! “it is only after having completed a piece of 
work that one knows how it should be done” (page 2). 
The subjects and the tests. The tests were first carried out 
on forty-five boys in the Paris public schools of an average age 
of 13 years, the results of only forty being considered, but 
they were later applied also to forty young men 18 to 20 years 
of age, these subjects being students in the Versailles normal 
school. The tests used include strength of grip of both right 
and left hands as measured by the oval dynamometer, 
strength of back by vertical pull, strength of arms by climb- 
ing a rope, strength of legs by broad and high jump (only for 
older boys), and two tests on endurance with the use of the 
dynamometer and the Mosso ergograph; tests of the quick- 
ness of reaction, both simple and choice reactions being de- 
termined, of rate of tapping in a period of five seconds, of 
quickness of pressure on the dynamometer, and of speed of 
running; tests of respiration as measured by lung capacity 
with the spirometer, by finding the normal and the expanded 
chest measures, and by determining the maximum distance 
at which the subject could blow out a candle; and tests of 
circulation, measured by the pulse records under various 
conditions of mental attitude and physical exertion. Photo- 
graphs of standing position and of the profile, and various
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
anatomical measurements were also taken. ‘These measure- 
ments were weight, height, length of trunk ; girth of shoulders, 
of arm, and of wrist; length of limbs, of medius, and of 
stride; and five head diameters. The head of the school 
also furnished information as to social status of the parents 
and gave certain moral characterizations of the boys. He 
also ranked the boys according to estimated intelligence. 
In addition to the physical measurements of the subjects, 
their memory span of digits was also determined. 
Binet’s methods of correlation and his results. The results 
are not treated very scientifically. No measures of varia- 
bility from the averages are given, and in many instances 
slight errors in calculation are made. The degree of varia- 
bility of the scores in each test is roughly shown by dividing 
the subjects into four equal groups according to their rank 
in a given test and then getting the percentage relationship 
between the first and the last divisions. The work shows 
evidence of hasty and superficial treatment. 
Correlations are not, of course, calculated by methods now 
in use, but are indicated approximately by two other methods 
devised by the authors. In the first of these the names of 
the forty subjects are divided into four equal groups accord- 
ing to the ranks of these subjects in some one test, and 
opposite each group is then placed the average of their ranks 
obtained in some other test with which this one is to be cor- 
related. If the correlation in the two tests is high, these © 
averages will, of course, increase rapidly for successive groups 
from the first to the fourth. An illustration will make this 
method clear. In Table 1 the letters A to L represent the 
names of subjects, and the Roman numerals indicate the 
different tests. The numbers of the subjects represent their 
respective ranks. The correspondence between the ranks 
in Tests I and IT is obviously rather close because the averages 
of the successive quarters of the ranks in the second column,

Test II, increase regularly from 2} to 11. The correlation is 
high whenever the averages in each case are just equal to 
the similar averages in the first column, Test I. The first 
and the second average is each out by only a fraction and the 
third and forth agree with those of the first column; but the 
absolute amount of the divergences is not a reliable index of 
the degree of correlation. 
The second correlation method used in this study was to 
arrange the names of the subjects according to the rank 
of the scores in one of the tests, and then to write opposite 
the name of each subject his rank in each of the other tests. 
This method is illustrated in Table 2. When these ranks 
are added, the correlation is high if the totals of the ranks of 
each subject increase rather regularly from the first name to 
the last. If the several totals remain practically constant 
from the first to the last name, there is no correlation. The 
illustration shows only three exceptions to a constant increase 
in the totals from the first to the last number; hence the 
correlation is positive and somewhat marked. While the 
difference between the first and smallest total and the
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  154 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
largest one is 36 (43—7), it is not as large as it would be if 
the correlation were perfect, —i.e., 44, or 48—4. Even 
such a difference, however, would not prove that the cor- 
relation between each successive pair of tests is perfect, a fact 
that is probably obvious to the reader. 
These methods of correlation, while somewhat superior to a 
general estimate based on the ranks alone, are obviously far 
inferior to a method developed in its essential features by 
Galton and later perfected by Pearson and others. This 
method, now commonly in use, expresses the correlation in a 
single number, the percentage of correlation between the 
two columns; and while it is applicable in a strict sense to 
only two series of measurements or test scores at a time, there 
are a number of ways now developed of expressing the cor- 
relation of one test with several others combined. This 
more accurate correlation method was probably first applied 
in 1901 to the results of intelligence tests by Clark Wissler, 
one of Cattell’s students. By Binet’s method the relative 
standing of any individual could at once be seen by taking 
note of the relative size of his total of the ranks in all the 
tests; the smaller the size of this total, the higher was the 
standing. Thus, in Table 2, A is seen at once to have the 
highest standing and B is close to A, while J has nearly as 
low standing as L. 
By the methods indicated Binet and Vaschide found a con- 
siderable degree of correlation among the various physical 
measurements of the group of younger boys, and somewhat 
less correlation in the case of the older subjects. Only a 
slight correlation was found between memory span for digits 
and the combined physical tests, and also between the latter 
and estimated intelligence, this latter positive relationship 
existing only in the extreme groups as ranked for intelligence 
—that is, in the best and the poorest one fourth of the 
subjects.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLIGENCE IN THE 
FEEBLE-MINDED 
In 1900 Simon published an article giving records of 
anthropometric measurements of 223 abnormal boys ranging 
in ages from 8 to 23 years (191). This research was carried 
out under the direction of Binet, in the colony of Vaucluse 
on persons with various degrees of feeble-mindedness down 
to and including idiocy. The object was to find out whether 
there is any correlation between the physical traits measured 
and intellectual capacity. The following measurements 
were made: height, chest, breadth of shoulders, maximum 
circumference of the head, weight, and reach of the arms. 
Correlation tables are given to show the interrelations of 
these several measurements, and age comparisons of these 
children are made with data from normal children obtained 
by numerous other investigators. Comparisons of the data 
obtained from extreme degrees of intellectuality within the 
colony itself are also made. Results show no general cor- 
respondence between physical development and degree of 
intelligence, although there is evidence that certain of the 
feeble-minded subjects had a general lack of physical develop- 
ment, rather than significant defects of a particular kind. 
Simon therefore disagreed with both extreme views then held 
as to the relationships between physical and mental develop- 
ment — with the one held by Galton, for example, that 
physical development in mentally abnormal persons is inde- 
pendent of their intelligence, and also with its opposite 
extreme, held by Porter, as we have already seen, that 
physical development in children corresponds to the degree 
lof their intelligence. No such general conclusions as either 
lof these could be arrived at from the data obtained. In 
his doctorate thesis, Simon studied correlations between the 
physical (height and weight) and the intellectual develop-
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ment of 167 of the subjects of this study, comparing children 
of successive years of increase in age (193). 
CEPHALIC MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS TO 
INTELLIGENCE 
In 1901 Binet pointed out that it had apparently been 
established by the researches of various authorities (67) that 
the average cephalic measures of intelligent individuals are 
greater than those of unintelligent persons. He tells us that 
he had long desired to study this problem closely himself by 
actual measurements of the heads of various children of 
different mental capacity. Ina series of five articles (33) he 
reports results of investigations on the technique of head 
measurements as well as of actual measurements of the head 
capacity of about 250 children. Binet suspected that a 
person making head measurements might be influenced by 
his knowledge of the classification of the subjects, as to 
whether they were rated as “superior in intelligence” or 
“inferior in intelligence,” tending unconsciously in decisions 
on finer points — e.g., as to whether a true measure is nearer 
122 mm. or 123 mm. — to favor the larger of two possible 
measures in the case of the intelligent and the smaller in the 
case of the unintelligent subjects; that is, he looked for 
a slight suggestion effect on the results, even in the case of 
such physical measurements. His experience with tests and 
measurements had given him grounds for such suspicions, 
and he desired to keep the results free from subjective ele- 
ments. The results of his experiments on this problem 
with respect to the head measurements showed that the 
suspicion was well founded; that the knowledge that a given 
child had been classed by his instructors as very intelligent 
did actually carry with it a tendency toward a constan 
error of increase, whereas the awareness that a child had bee 
selected as being unintelligent carried with it a tendency t     
                        
                    
  
-P-A-G-E-171
  Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 157 
a constant error of decrease in the size of the measurements 
of the head. It was therefore decided that in his own tests 
Binet was to be ignorant, for the time, of the classification 
of each subject. It was also found that different testers 
differed among themselves in the same way, some geiting 
slightly larger measures than others, as a general tendency. 
Thus Binet found that Simon, who had had considerable 
experience with Broca’s method, constantly obtained slightly 
larger dimensions on the same subjects than he did himself ; 
but he also found that this difference was reduced when the 
testers had a knowledge of the nature of their own deviations. 
Thus by training and by comparing results, different testers 
would finally drop off any subjective tendencies and arrive 
at more accurate results. 
In the work of obtaining the cephalic measurements of the 
school children, Binet had instructors select for him only 
children of extreme differences in estimated intelligence, so 
that any existing correlations between size of head dimen- 
sions and degree of intelligence would be most evident; but 
during the process of measuring he was himself ignorant of 
he classification of the several subjects, at least in some 
f the schools. Only 11- and 13-year-old children were 
thosen, these being selected independently of grade classifica- 
ions. To give an idea of the severity of selection for the 
xtremes of intelligence, Binet tells us in one of his articles 
hat about five intelligent and five unintelligent children 
ere chosen from each group of forty. During the summer 
acation and early in the fall Binet tested large numbers of 
hildren of the primary grades in Seine-et-Marne and in 
aris, reporting the results of each group in a separate article 
in the Année. 
After taking the various precautions against errors that 
is experiments had shown him to be necessary, he con- 
luded from the measurements of about 250 children, that 
        
             
   
     
   
      
     
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
those of superior mental ability have on the average the 
greater head dimensions. There were, however, irregulari- 
ties in these results, so that it would not be safe to select 
children for superior intelligence on the basis of head measure- 
ments. That is to say, head measurements could not be 
regarded as safe tests of intelligence for purposes of individual 
selection, and the size and shape of the head must be con- 
sidered, according to Binet’s results, as unsatisfactory in- 
dicators of intellectual capacity. Indeed, Simon found in a 
study (194), published also in 1901, that among feeble- 
minded children idiots are characterized, from the point of 
view of cephalometry, by excessive variations in the size of the 
head, their head measures being usually considerably greater 
or less than those of morons, and thus tending toward ex- 
tremes in this class of subjects. Binet’s results have been 
supported in general by subsequent investigations. 
LATER STUDIES BY BINET OF PHYSICAL SIGNS OF 
INTELLIGENCE 
As late as 1910 (43) Binet contributed an extended study 
of the physical signs of intelligence. Head measurements of 
blind, deaf, and backward children were compared with 
those of normal children, and various so-called signs of 
degeneracy were considered, such as irregular teeth, stra- 
bismus, malformation of the ear and palate, extreme facial 
asymmetry, as well as speech defects. A study of th 
hands of both normal and abnormal children was made b; 
means of photographs in different positions, and physiog: 
nomies were similarly studied from both profiles and fron 
views. No important relations were found, and Binet say: 
in conclusion that nothing is as deceiving as the physical 
appearance of intelligence, and that it is necessary t 
react consciously against our instinctive impressions in thi: 
regard.
-P-A-G-E-173

TWO-POINT DISCRIMINATION AND INTELLIGENCE: RESULTS 
UNRELIABLE 
Wide differences had developed in the data of different 
investigators in tactile sensibility. Binet attempted to 
reduce these differences and to prepare the way to more 
uniform methods and results, by describing an esthesiometer 
which he had devised (31), and, in another article, by out- 
lining methods to be followed in esthesiometry (32). In 
the early part of the present century Binet published a 
number of articles on this subject, and he developed a 
“method of irregular variations,” consisting of the arrange- 
ment of a series of stimuli ranging by irregular steps from 
a certain minimum to the maximum employed on the test. 
The point differences thus succeed each other irregularly, 
but each difference occurs a number of times that is just equal 
for all differences. He also showed in other articles (35-38) 
the effect in actual experiments of changes in attitudes due 
to exercise and to suggestion from the experimenter, bringing 
about apparent modifications in the subject’s sensibility ; 
and he warned against overlooking effects of factors of this’ 
kind. He contends in these articles, from the results of his 
experiments, that it is impossible to determine the indi- 
vidual’s threshold for the discrimination of two points. For 
“it varies from one moment to another, and the more it is 
sought, the more difficult it is to discover; moreover, it is 
related so closely to the method of interpreting sensations 
that even in the cases where it seems to have a definite 
position, we cannot be sure that it represents the degree of 
acuity of the organ” (38, page 252). His attempts thus to 
measure effects of voluntary attention and to show differ- 
ences between the five most and the five least intelligent in a 
group of thirty-two children therefore failed to give any 
positive results.

160 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
EVEN HANDWRITING AND PALMISTRY INVESTIGATED BY 
BINET AS POSSIBLE TESTS 
Individuality in handwriting had been an inviting subject 
for students of psychology as well as for graphologists. Even 
before the beginning of this century handwriting had been 
studied from several points of view, both in normal and in 
abnormal subjects (105). Binet did not overlook this type 
of reaction, so infinitely variable from individual to indi- 
vidual, as a possible indicator of the aspects of character in 
which he was interested, particularly of intelligence. In 
1903 and the following year he published (39) certain analytic 
studies of handwriting, and in 1906 his book, The Revela- 
tions of Handwriting under Scientific Control, appeared (40). 
This last study was an attempt to determine whether sex, 
age, degree of intelligence, and character are revealed in 
handwriting. The natural writing, taken mostly from en- 
velopes that had passed through the mails, was submitted 
both to graphologists and to other persons. Sex was judged, 
it was found, somewhat better than by pure guess; age also 
was determined with a small degree of accuracy, the deter- 
minations averaging within about ten years of the true ages 
of the subjects. From the writing of some very well-known 
geniuses and a few inferior persons as well as from that of 
persons nearer the average and of some well above this 
average, he found slightly positive results in attempts t 
estimate intelligence, but many persons did not show thei 
degree of intelligence in their handwriting. Characte 
determination as estimated from the writings of certai 
notorious criminals, on the one hand, and of men of recog: 
nized character, on the other, was even less successful thai 
intelligence determination. On the whole the professional 
proved themselves in these determinations to be superio! 
to the other judges. “‘It does not appear to me impossible,’

    Historical Background of Binet-Simon Tests 161 
he said, “that graphology may yet contribute to experi- 
mental psychology a good test of intelligence” (39, page 
210). 
Binet examined so wide a range of possible intelligence 
indicators that even palmistry did not escape his experimental 
study (44). When professional palmists were allowed to 
see only the hand of subjects or pictures of their hands, their 
estimates of their intelligence were but little above expecta- 
tions based on pure guess, or chance. Thus Binet showed his 
open-mindedness in being willing and ready to canvass the 
whole range of possible indicators of intelligence from 
palmistry, for the study of which he felt obliged to apologize, 
to the most complex psychological tests. His studies of 
various physical traits in relation to intelligence continued, 
along with the improved revisions of the intelligence scales, 
right down to the time of his death; but the physical signs 
lof intelligence promised to be meager indeed, as we have 
een, while the scale of psychological tests, the development 
f which we shall presently trace, brought a revolution in 
ducational and social service methods and made the name 
f the authors familiar tq nearly every teacher and social 
orker in the civilized world.

  CHAPTER NINE 
Biner’s First INTELLIGENCE SCALE 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS NEEDED IN THE STUDY OF SUBNORMALS 
Interest in defective children and in their education arose 
first in France, where Esquirol (1772-1840) had made the 
important distinction, now generally recognized, between 
the idiot, whose intelligence does not develop beyond a very 
low level, and the demented person. Distinctions were early 
made between different degrees of feeble-mindedness, idiocy 
being the term applied to the lowest degree of mentality, 
imbecility to the next lowest, and debility! to the highest 
degree, or the degree next to the lowest cases of individuals 
classed as normal. But these terms had no precise signifi- 
cance, and before the contribution of Binet and Simon no 
exact standards for comparison existed. What one alienist 
called idiocy another would call imbecility, if his standard 
differed from that of the first, while a third, paying attention 
to yet other traits of the defective person and interpreting 
them differently, would probably class him as a moron. 
Dr. Blin (68), at the colony of Vaucluse, complained of just 
such differences in standards. So great uncertainty in 
1 In England “‘feeble-mindedness” is used to designate the higher class of 
defectiveness in these three degrees of subnormality, and “amentia” or 
“mental deficiency” is used to cover all three degrees. ‘‘Deficiency,” how- 
ever, seems also to include certain forms of instability, and is technically not 
as good a term as “amentia.” In America “feeble-mindedness” is used 
as the general term to include all three degrees, and the term “moron” 
(méros = foolish), suggested by Goddard, is used to designate a person of 
the upper grade of feeble-mindedness. Thus in the English usage aments 
include idiots, imbeciles, and the feeble-minded, while in the American 
usage the feeble-minded include idiots, imbeciles, and morons. In this book 
we shall adhere to this latter meaning of the terms, and we shall use the term 
“moronity” as codrdinate with “imbecility” and “idiocy.” In all quota- 
tions and references to foreign works changes in the names used will be made 
to conform to this usage. ‘“Moronity” then replaces “debility” as here 
used in the text. 
163
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
classification and so great variation in the use of terms to 
designate the several classes of defectives existed that 
statistical reports could be of little scientific value. In 
America, Kuhlmann, then a fellow in psychology in Clark 
University, pointed out (150) the lack of consistency and the 
need of a common terminology in classification. He criti- 
cized the earlier systems of questions by Seguin and Voisin, 
Maller, Sollier, Sommer, and others, and stated his belief in 
the possibility of basing a system of classification chiefly 
on experimental methods; and he himself carried out a few 
experiments on imbeciles and higher grades of defectives. 
He adds a valuable bibliography on the subject. 
Binet and Simon held that, contrary to the general practice 
of medical alienists, it was possible to formulate precise 
definitions which would enable competent persons to agree 
on the diagnoses of idiocy, imbecility, or moronity. “‘We 
have made a methodical comparison,” they tell us in a later 
work, “between the admission certificates filled up for the 
same children with a few days’ interval by the doctors of 
Sainte-Anne, Bicétre, the Salpétriére, and Vaucluse. We 
have compared several hundreds of these certificates, and 
we think we may say without exaggeration that they looked 
as if they had been drawn by chance out of a sack” (60, 
page 76). 
These differences in classification were attributed by Binet 
to ignorance on the part of some physicians, to variability 
in the meaning of terms, and to lack of precision in the dis- 
crimination of symptoms. In the work of the alienist exact 
standards for classification were not so essential as in schools 
where different educational treatments were to be given 
children of different degrees of ability and where large 
numbers compelled a uniformity of procedure. While even 
the ancients undoubtedly recognized the fact that some 
children could not learn well in comparison with normal
-P-A-G-E-179
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 165 
children, the maladjustments in the schools were naturally 
more explicitly forced on the attention of educators when 
education became more nearly universal among the children. 
A society for child study was organized in Paris, and it 
studied, under Binet’s leadership, the practical problems of 
child adjustment in the schools. In the early part of this 
century a great deal of préliminary work in this line was under - 
way. A number of books on abnormal children appeared 
(97, 223, 155, 10), indicating a growing interest in the problem 
at the time Binet and Simon took up the work of the first 
scale. As early as 1896 Binet wrote on special classes for 
arrested children (22). 
THE FRENCH COMMISSION TO STUDY SUBNORMAL CHILDREN 
IN THE SCHOOLS 
~~ In the early fall of 1904 the Minister of Public Instruction 
appointed a commission to study measures to be taken in 
the education of subnormal children in Paris, who were 
unable to profit by the instruction regularly given in the 
public schools. It was decided that children of this kind 
should be eliminated from the normal work of the schools 
and that they should be taught in a special school. Ad- 
- mission to this school was to be on the basis of pedagogical 
and medical examinations. It was specifically to meet 
this emergency that the first intelligence scale was con- 
structed (57). The need of an objective means of selecting 
the subnormal children from the normal was obvious, for 
without such means great injustices would be done, and sub- 
jective opinions more or less influenced by personal advan- 
tage would be the basis of choice. 
EARLY TESTS WITHOUT STANDARDIZATION 
As we have already seen, this intelligence scale was not the 
first case of the devising of intelligence tests. Indeed, the
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
testing movement was even then so well advanced that Binet 
and Simon tell us that ‘“‘The use of tests is today very wide- 
spread; there are even some contemporary authors who have 
made a specialty of organizing new tests. They organize 
these tests according to theoretical views without pre- 
occupying themselves with trying them out at length” 
(68, page 195). The tests then used did not clearly distin- 
guish between innate and acquired abilities, and they were 
as a rule poorly constructed and involved large elements of 
personal judgment in the evaluation of results. Dr. Damaye, 
a student of Dr. Blin, published, only about a year before 
- the first Binet-Simon scale was prepared, an article in which 
he showed in detail how the method of mental examination 
used by his teacher could be applied to defectives (see 57). 
He made up a list of numerous questions covering twenty 
different topics concerning the subject’s name, his parents, 
age, knowledge of bodily parts, sensations, ideas of objects and 
of time, space, country, etc. A number of questions also dealt 
with military service and: occupations. But these tests 
were not simply questions; they also comprised observations 
by the examiner on the subject’s manners, habits of cleanli- 
ness and dress, language, and his ability to calculate, to write, 
and to read. Simple commands were also carried out, such 
as, “Show me your hands; your tongue. Close your eyes. 
Put your finger over your right ear.” 
The questions were poorly formulated in many cases, and 
responses to them were weighted arbitrarily and not stand- 
ardized, even though the test had been applied to 250 ab- 
normal children; but the study was praised by Binet and 
Simon, despite faults of the specific questions formulated, 
and was referred to as “‘superior in precision to anything we 
have read.” They said it was “the first effort to apply 
a scientific method to the diagnosis of mental defectives” 
(57, page 182). These tests undoubtedly suggested to them
-P-A-G-E-181
  
Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 167 
some of the tests they later used in their own intelligence 
scale. 
THE SPECIFIC OBJECT OF THE FIRST BINET-SIMON 
INTELLIGENCE SCALE 
Binet and Simon limited themselves in the construction 
of their scale to the practical end of devising a measure of 
the intellectual capacities of the children in school, with the 
avowed purpose of knowing of each child;whether he was 
normal or was mentally retarded. They specifically denied 
any intention of determining with the scale whether any given 
defectives were curable or not, or could be ameliorated ; 
and they limited themselves strictly to one thing, the deter- 
mination of the mental state of the subject. Moreover, they 
explicitly state that in their determination of defectiveness 
they restrict themselves to the mentally retarded and do not 
attempt to deal with forms of neural instability, which they 
admit are very hard to distinguish from certain attitudes in 
normal individuals. 
Various types of the mentally disorganized, such as those 
subject to impulsions and obsessions, and degenerates, as 
well as dements, whose intelligence has actually suffered 
diminution under certain diseased conditions, are excluded 
from their consideration. This must be kept clearly in 
mind by the reader. ‘‘Our purpose,” these authors inform 
us, “is by no means to study, to analyze, and to disentangle 
the aptitudes of persons inferior in intelligence. That will 
be the object of a later work. Here we limit ourselves to 
the evaluation and the quantitative determination of their 
intelligence in general; we shall determine their intellectual 
level; and to give an idea of this level we shall compare it 
with that of normal children of the same age, or of an analo- 
gous level” (page 193). 
Binet and Simon do not fall into the error of supposing that 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
the intellectual condition of mentally defective individuals 
is described merely by indicating the age level to which they 
belong. “It appears, indeed, that the intelligence of these 
beings has undergone a certain arrest; but it does.not follow 
that the arrest, that is to say, the disproportion between their 
degree of intelligence and their age, should be the only char- 
acteristic of their condition” (page 192). The idiot of 15 
years who has a mental level of the 3-year-old child and is 
just in the early child-stage of verbal language, is not to be 
completely likened to a child of 3 years. The child is normal 
while the idiot is:an invalid (infirme); there are necessarily 
differences between them, either apparent or hidden. In 
_idiots,. as careful studies have revealed, certain mental 
furictions are almost absent while other functions are better 
developed. These individuals, moreover, frequently show 
scertain well-marked: special aptitudes, as in music, in me- 
chanical activities, or in calculation. 
. These investigators assert that there is no unique method 
to follow in making a scale to test intelligence. Binet’s 
broad experience with numerous tests of different kinds 
on large numbers of both normal and abnormal subjects 
had qualified him thoroughly to recognize that a variety e* 
tests and methods was necessary. In previous writings he 
had emphasized the fact that no single test, however good 
it may be, is sufficient to test the intelligence of an indi- 
vidual, because of the great complexity of the intellectual 
functions. The method in tests like these must be objective 
and free from the influence of what the parents say about the 
child’s condition, and of any preconceived notions of the 
tester. The authors saw certain merits in the “medical 
method,” evaluating the anatomical, the physiological, and 
the pathological signs of inferiority, and also in the “‘peda- 
gogical method,” estimating a child by what he has learned, 
as well as in the “psychological method,” based on direct
-P-A-G-E-183
  
Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 169 
observation and test. Each of these methods can render 
some service, but the psychological method is the most, and 
the medical method the least direct, the latter judging 
intelligence from physical signs. Binet’s attitude toward the 
indirect method is certainly liberal in view of his failure to 
find in numerous experiments any very significant relations 
between intelligence and physical, sensory, or physiological 
measurements. 
A METRICAL SCALE THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA 
The fundamental idea in their psychological method Binet 
held to be what he called a metrical scale of intelligence. 
“This scale is composed of a series of tests arranged in order 
of increasing difficulty, beginning at one end with the lowest 
intellectual level that one can observe and extending at the 
other to the level of average and normal intelligence. To 
each test corresponds a different mental level’? (page 194). 
Binet asserted that this scale will not, properly speaking, 
permit of a measurement of intelligence — because intellec- 
tual qualities are not measurable in the way that lengths are, 
since they are not superposable — but only of a classifica- 
tion, an arrangement into a hierarchy of different intelli- 
gences. In practice this classification approximates a meas- 
ure. Thus in testing any two individuals we can determine 
with the scale not only which of them is higher in in- 
telligence and how many degrees, but also how each one 
compares with the average of other individuals considered 
as the norm and how much he is above or below this average. 
Thus, knowing the intellectual development of normal 
children from year to year, or having the norms of their 
mental growth, we shall be able to determine in the case of 
any child how many years he is behind mentally, or in 
advance, at a given time; and we can determine, moreover,
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
to what degree on the scale idiocy, imbecility, or moronity 
belongs. 
The authors assure us that the tests which they propose in 
this scale have been tried out many times and retained, 
while others, after similar trials, have been discarded; but 
unfortunately they give us neither the complete results nor 
the methods of these experiments. 
PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE SCALE 
The construction of a practical scale of this kind im- 
posed upon Binet and Simon certain limitations. ‘“ We have 
desired,” they say, “that all our tests shall be simple, rapid, 
convenient, precise, heterogeneous, maintaining the subject 
in contact with the experimenter, and bearing principally on 
the faculty of judgment” (page 195). As to rapidity, we are 
told that this is a necessity in this sort of examination. It is 
impossible to continue the tests for a period of more than 
twenty minutes without fatiguing the subject, and during 
this time it is necessary to probe him from all angles and to 
carry out at least ten tests, which leaves only about two 
minutes for each test. So they were obliged to omit any use 
of long exercises, however good these might be. It will 
be helpful to the reader to keep in mind that this was the 
idea in view, and the situation, in the construction of the 
tests. 
Then, the tests must be of great enough variety to explore 
all the important forms of intellectual capacity. Binet in 
his earlier articles has repeatedly stressed the impossibility 
of testing adequately with a single test so complex a thing 
as a person’s intelligence. The authors recognized, however, 
that it would be futile to attempt to measure all the sensory, 
perceptual, and other aspects of the intellectual processes. 
“fA little reflection has shown us that this would be a great 
waste of time. There is in intelligence, it appears to us, a
-P-A-G-E-185
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 171 
fundamental organ, any defect or alteration in which is of 
the greatest consequence to the practical life. This basic 
factor in intelligence is judgment, otherwise spoken of as good 
sense, practical judgment, initiative, the ability to adapt 
oneself. To judge well, to comprehend well, to reason, well, 
these are the essentials of intelligence. A person may be a 
moron or an imbecile if he lacks judgment; but with good 
judgment he could not be either” (pages 196 f.). This shows 
us the conception that the authors had of the intelligence 
which they attempted to test. Binet knew very well from 
his previous experiments that particular and special sensory 
and motor functions carried very little general import as to 
one’s intelligence, and in the present article the authors 
refer to Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller as persons who, 
though deprived of certain senses, had very good general 
ability. On first thought, memory would seem to be of 
capital importance in mental processes and therefore to 
demand a good deal of attention in the construction of a 
test of intelligence, and Binet so considered it ten years 
earlier; but it was clear to him in 1905 that it is distinct 
and independent of judgment. One may have “good sense” 
and be lacking in memory, and the reverse condition is also 
frequently found. Hence, we are informed, the first place 
has been assigned to judgment in the intelligence scale. In 
this scale the authors have even taken special pains to lay 
traps to lead the subject into making absurd responses, thus 
to test his capacity for sound judgment. It was, of course, 
impracticable to hold exclusively to this guiding idea of 
what the tests should stress, and to isolate clearly the judg- 
ment element. With children below two years of age, for 
example, the tests had to take into consideration the degree 
lof accuracy in motor codrdination, and the manifestations 
f attention, since the infant cannot overtly express judg- 
ents.

THE FIRST SCALE 
The thirty tests of this 1905 scale follow. 
1. Visual codrdination. Noting the degree of codrdina- 
tion of movement of the head and eyes as a lighted match 
is passed slowly before the subject’s eyes. 
2. Prehension provoked tactually. A small wooden cube 
is to be placed in contact with the palm or back of the sub- 
ject’s hand. He must grasp it and carry it to his mouth, 
and Ee coérdinated grasping and other movements are to be, 
noted.    
   
    
      
       
      
    
      
      . 8. Prehension provoked visually. Same as 2, except that 
the object is placed within the subject’s reach, but not in 
contact with him. The experimenter, to catch the child’s 
attention, encourages him orally and with appropriate ges- 
tures to take the object. 
4. Cognizance of food. A small bit of chocolate and a 
piece of wood of similar dimensions are successively shown 
the subject, and signs of his recognition of the food and 
attempts to take it are noted carefully. 
5. Seeking food when a slight difficulty is interposed. A 
small piece of the chocolate, as used in the previous test, is 
wrapped in a piece of paper and given to the subject. Obser- 
vations are made on his manner of getting the food and 
separating it from the paper. 
6. The execution of simple orders and the imitation of ges- 
tures. The orders are mostly such as might be understood 
from the accompanying gestures alone. 
(This is the limit for idiots as experimentally determined.) 
7. Verbal knowledge of objects. The child is to touch 
his head, nose, ear, etc.» and also to hand the experimenter| 
on command a particular one of three well-known objects ; 
cup, key, string. 
1 For a fuller description of the tests and for instructions for giving them| 
the interested reader must go to the original article or to an abbreviated| 
translation, such as that given in Whipple’s Manual of Mental and Physical 
Tests (1910), pages 475 ff.
-P-A-G-E-187
  
‘ 
Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 173 
8. Knowledge of objects in a picture as shown by finding 
them and pointing them out when they are called by name. 
9. Naming objects designated in a picture. 
(This is the upper limit of the 3-year-old normal children. 
The three preceding tests are not in order of increasing diffi- 
culty, for whoever passes 7 usually passes 8 and 9 also.) 
10. Immediate comparison of two lines for discrimination 
as to length. 
11. Reproduction of. series of three digits immediately 
after oral presentation. 
12. Weight discrimination. Comparison of two weights 
— of 3 and 12 g., of 6 and 15 g., and of 3 and 15 g. 
13. Suggestibility. (a) Modification of 7: an object not 
among the three present is asked for. (b) Modification of 8: 
“Where [in the picture] is the patapoum? the nitchevo?” 
(These words have no meaning.) (c) Modification of 10: 
the two lines to be compared are of equal length. 
(Test 13 is admitted to be a test not of intelligence but of 
“force of judgment” and “resistance of character.”’) 
14. Definitions of familiar objects — house, horse, fork, 
mamma. 
(This is the limit of 5-year-old normal children, except 
that they fail on Test 13.) 
15. Repetition of sentences of fifteen words each, immedi- 
ately after hearing them spoken by the examiner. ~ 
(This is the limit of imbeciles.) 
16. Giving differences between various pairs of familiar 
objects recalled in memory: (a) paper and cardboard, (b) a 
y and a butterfly, and (c) wood and glass. 
(Test 16 alone effectively separated normal children of 5 
land 7 years.) 
17. Immediate memory of pictures of familiar objects. 
hirteen pictures pasted on two pieces of cardboard are 
resented simultaneously. The subject looks at them for 
hirty seconds and then gives the names of those recalled. 
_ 18. Drawing from memory two different designs shown 
imultaneously for ten seconds.
-P-A-G-E-188
  ’ 
174 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
19. Repetition of series of digits after oral presentation. 
Three series of three digits each, three of four each, three of 
five, etc., are presented until not one of the three series in a 
group is repeated correctly. The number of digits in the 
highest series which the subject repeats is his score. 
20. Giving from memory the resemblance among familiar 
objects: (a) a wild poppy (red) and blood, (b) an ant, a fly, 
a butterfly, and a flea, and (c) a newspaper, a label, and a 
picture. 
21. Rapid discrimination of lines. A line of 30 cm. is 
compared successively with fifteen lines varying from 35 
down to 31cm. A more difficult set of comparisons is then 
made of a line of 100 mm. with twelve lines varying from 103 
to 101 mm. 
22. Arranging in order five weights — 15, 12, 9, 6, and 3 g. 
— of equal size. 
23. Identification of the missing weight from the series in 
Test 22 from which one is removed. The remaining weights 
are not in the right order. This test is given only when 
Test 22 is passed. 
(This is given as the most probable limit of morons.) 
24. Finding words to rime with a given word after the 
process has been illustrated. 
25. Supplying missing words at the end of simple sen- 
tences, one for each sentence. This is the Ebbinghaus com- 
pletion method simplified. 
26. Construction of a sentence to embody three given 
words: Paris, gutter, fortune. 
27. Making replies to twenty-five problem questions of 
graded difficulty; such as, “What is the thing to do when 
you are sleepy?” ‘Why is it better to continue with per- 
severance what one has started than to abandon it and start 
something else?” 
(Test 27 alone reveals the moron.) 
1 Some of these objects were evidently more familiar to the French children 
than they are to American children. Whipple changed them to (a) milk 
and snow, (b) a mosquito and a bee, and (c) a table, a chair, and a door. 
Binet said that there were Paris children who had never seen wild poppies 
or ants and cautioned the tester to use objects familiar to the children.
-P-A-G-E-189
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 175 
28. Giving the time that it would be if the large and the 
small hands of the clock were interchanged at four minutes 
to three and at twenty minutes after six. A much more 
difficult test is given those who succeed in the inversion; 
namely, to explain the impossibility of the precise transposi- 
tion indicated. 
29. Drawing what a quarto-folded paper with a piece cut 
out of the once-folded edge would look like if unfolded. 
80. Giving distinctions between abstract terms; as 
between liking and respecting a person; between being sad 
and being bored. 
THE SUBJECTS ON WHOM THE SCALE WAS STANDARDIZED 
The authors arranged these thirty tests into what by pre- 
liminary testing they had found to be an ascending order of 
difficulty. The scale was applied to normal children in the 
primary schools and also to subnormal subjects both in the 
Salpétriére and in the primary schools. The normal children 
tested were selected by their teachers for normal intelligence 
—those who were neither retarded nor advanced. They 
were children who were placed in the grades just right 
for their ages and who were just at the exact ages desired 
(59, page 246). While many such children were tested, the 
descriptions of the reactions of normal children to the scale 
and the norms given by the authors are based on the records 
of fifty children of just even 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 years, about 
ten cases in each group. e    
   
  
                 
      SOME TENTATIVE STANDARDS 
The following standards were set up as a result of these 
tests: Tests 1 to 9, inclusive, were passed by all 3-year-olds. 
‘ests 10 to 12, and 14 in addition, were passed by the 5-year- 
Ids, but these children required help on 12 and repetitions 
f Question 10 to sustain the attention. Test 13 showed that 
he youngest children were most suggestible. Test 16 sepa- 
ated absolutely the 5-year-olds from the 7-year-olds.
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
While for the 3- and the 5-year-olds there are certain tests 
called “frontiers” which effectively check the group in ques- 
tion but are passed by practically all normal children of 
higher groups, the distinction between the 7- and 9- and the 
9- and 11-year-old levels, successively, is made upon the 
basis of performance in certain tests which permit of answers 
of a wide range of efficiency, and for which norms computed 
from very scant data are given. These tests include three 
memory tests: verbal memory of sentences, 15, memory of 
pictures, 17, and memory of figures, 19; four sensory tests : 
comparison of the length of lines, 21, arranging five weights 
in order, 22, identification of the missing weight in a series 
of five, 23, and drawing what a quarto-folded paper with a 
piece cut out of the oncé-folded edge would look like, 29; 
five tests in which language plays a great part: abstract- 
questions test, 27, finding rimes, 24, giving distinctions be- 
tween abstract terms, 30, using three given words in a sen- 
tence, 26, and the sentence-completion test, 25. The sug- 
gestibility test, 13, was also found useful. 
The reader may be surprised, knowing Binet’s depreciation 
of the factors of intelligence involved, to see that the majority 
of these thirteen tests are tests of memory or sensation. 
However, in tests of this kind, attention is paid by the 
experimenter to details which may indicate the degree of 
judgment possessed by the subject. Thus for verbal memory 
of sentences, the number of absurdities committed is held t 
be just as significant as the total number of sentences repeate: 
correctly, and in this, as in the language tests particularly, 
the number of absurdities figures in the norms given. I 
Test 19 the child was to indicate after each repetition of 
series of digits whether or not he was satisfied with hi: 
response. Satisfaction with a repetition involving several 
grave errors was considered indicative of low intelligence 
In the arrangement of weights, the method adopted, or th
-P-A-G-E-191
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 177 
lack of method, was held to be very important. This test, 
together with Test 29, is classed by Binet as a sensory judg- 
ment and reasoning test. Moreover, the authors attach im- 
portance to the sensory tests because of the fact that “they 
will certainly be very useful in the analysis of the aptitudes 
of defective persons”’ (page 273). 
THE TEST LIMITS OF IDIOTS, IMBECILES, AND MORONS 
On the basis of this intelligence scale the authors found it 
possible to classify idiots, imbeciles, and other feeble-minded 
persons in a somewhat objective manner. For the conven- 
ence of the reader, we have inserted in the scale here out- 
ined the upper limits both of certain normal age-groups — 
where such limits were sufficientlf clear cut — and of the 
subnormal groups. Binet and Simon found that idiots could 
not go beyond Test 6 and that imbeciles could not go beyond 
Test 15. For the morons, no such precise limit can be given. 
If some definite point on the scale were to be cited as the 
high level, that between Tests 23 and 24 would be chosen. 
Yet at rare intervals persons of this class were found who 
could make rimes (Test 34) or compose a loose compound 
sentence to include the three words of Test 26. It is there- 
ore probable that these nearer normal persons would have 
assed Test 25, although this test was not given them in the 
egular routine testing. 
The procedure was, in the case of school children, to begin 
ith Test 16. This being passed, the thirteen tests (or more 
ften the twelve tests, that of suggestibility being omitted) 
numerated above for children of primary school age were 
dministered. Morons were found who had normal mem- 
ries, normal visual memory of pictures being, indeed, the 
ule. Many of these children had excellent “sensory intelli- 
ence.” The five language tests differentiated them dis- 
inctly from normal children, Test 27 being particularly
-P-A-G-E-192
178 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
valuable in this regard. Binet and Simon tell us that “Ir 
a rapid examination, it might be sufficient to ask them sever 
or eight of these abstract questions; they would be classifiec 
at once” (page 336). As we shall see, however, this methoc 
was not intended to be used upon adult subnormals with 
out change; it applied to children of from 8 to 18 year 
of age. 
Within each of the three main divisions of the mentally 
deficient, sub-classes were designated and their limits tenta 
tively determined, but the reliability of the results is no 
great enough to warrant our consideration of these limits 
These three classifications of feeble-minded persons ar 
recognized by the authors as being purely practical, since 
no sharp, exact line can be drawn anywhere. Each clas: 
gradually shades off into the next above it. It was in con 
formity with medical usage to make three main divisions, anc 
the terms already in use were retained. 
Idiocy. Idiocy is the term applied by the authors t 
persons of so low a grade of mentality that they are without 
a vocabulary or make no use of language. This does no’ 
mean that they cannot pronounce certain words, but tha 
they are incapable of substituting words for objects in thei 
behavior. Thus in the scale, tests 7 and 8 present im 
passable obstacles to the idiot because he cannot pass readil} 
from objects or pictures to their names. Idiots can, of course 
learn to use certain names often met or specifically taught i 
connection with a few familiar objects, but their languag 
function is very narrowly limited. The characterization thu: 
given by Binet to idiots agrees, he reminds us, with th 
etymological sense of the word idios, meaning “alone”’ of 
“isolated.”” The individual who cannot use spoken languag} 
is certainly limited very much in social participation. Bin 
regarded the aptitudes of idiots as roughly equal to those 
normal children of 2 years of age or less. 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 179 
Imbecility. While the line between imbecility and mo- 
ronity could not be as closely drawn as it was between idiocy 
and imbecility, the authors found that these two upper 
classes of feeble-mindedness are separated by the following 
tests: giving differences between two known objects recalled 
in memory, arranging the weights in a series, and repeating a 
series of six digits (page 300). The morons did not give the 
series of digits in any random order and in absurd orders 
when they were asked to repeat them, as did the imbeciles. 
These tests and others like them, which call for precise com- 
prehension and demand a degree of judgment, do not fall 
within the range of the powers of the imbecile as this term 
was defined by Binet. He estimated that the aptitudes of 
imbeciles equaled roughly those in normal children of about 
2 to 5 years of age. 
Moronity. These studies on the two lower grades of de- 
fectives were made on children in the Salpétriére. Morons 
were studied in the primary schools, where they were known 
to shade off by degrees toward normality. Since the selec- 
tion of these moron children in the schools for purposes of 
special instruction was the chief object in the construction 
of the scale, it was necessary that children of different ages 
be studied and that norms be established for the several 
ages. A young mentally retarded child could not be expected 
to go as high in the test scale as an older child of an equal 
number of years of retardation. No general method of 
diagnosis of moronity independent of age is therefore at- 
tempted at this time. That, we are told, would go beyond 
the authors’ pretensions in this study. The morons studied 
ranged from 8 to 13 years. 
The selection of morons in the schools. In order to select 
the children to be tested individually for moronity, a list of 
the ages of all the children was compared with a list of their 
school marks. Those children were then chosen who, while 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
being among the oldest in the class, were consistently marked 
low in school work. The authors then asked that the children 
thus selected for tests be so distributed among normal 
children that they would not be known as inferior except as 
a result ofsthe tests applied. Thus the testers would not be 
influenced by a knowledge of the child’s status in advance of 
the testing, and a control on the validity of the tests was 
secured. 
In some cases the head of the school and the teacher of the 
child held conflicting opinions as to the mentality of the 
child, and in others similar conflicts arose between teachers 
of the same child in different years. These differences of 
opinion were settled beyond doubt by the tests. Ina general 
way it may be said that the morons showed their deficiency 
in dealing with abstract matters, especially with verbal 
abstractions. They were able to state differences and re- 
semblances between familiar objects, to pass the memory 
tests, 17, 18, and 19, and to arrange in series the lines and 
weights; but they failed on the higher tests dealing with the 
selection of certain abstract elements. 
Since normal 12-year-old children were as a rule found able 
to respond to abstract questions — a fact that Binet seems 
either to have inferred from the responses of the 11-year-olds 
or to have obtained from data not reported — the authors 
decided that morons were below the 12-year level of intelli- 
gence (page 300). However, we are informed, this inability 
to respond to abstract questions applies only to persons not 
above 14 years of age; it would be an insufficient criterion 
for distinguishing normal children from morons 20 years of 
age or older, who would have gained enough knowledge 
by experience to resemble normal children in responses to 
abstract relations. “It may be that certain differences are 
concealed under these resemblances and that we shall some 
day succeed in analyzing these differences so clearly that we
-P-A-G-E-195
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 181 
shall be able to find signs of mental retardation entirely inde- 
pendent of any consideration of age. It would evidently be 
a great advantage to know such signs, but for the present 
that which strikes us most often is the resemblances between 
very young normal children and older abnormal - persons. 
The resemblances are so numerous and so curious that on 
reading the description of the reactions of a child of which 
the age had not been given, one could not say whether the 
subject is normal or subnormal” (page 321). 
THE PROCEDURE IN TESTING THE SUBJECT 
The number of persons tested was recognized to be too 
small for reliable standards, however, and the authors’ 
general conception of the procedure to follow is better than 
their practical results show. The general idea favored by 
them was to give each subject every test in the scale and 
then to compare his score with the scores of normal age- 
groups without at first taking note of his age. Thus, having 
a scale of tests and a series of standards for the several ages, 
derived from tests of normal children, it is easy to find in this 
series the place of any person whose test score has been 
obtained. Then by taking into consideration his age, — 
that is, by comparing the age of the subject with that of the 
group whose normal score his just equals, — one can easily 
determine whether-or-not-he-is retarded, and how much. 
The authors supposed that one could also find at the same 
time in what particular mental functions he falls down (page 
326). For more rapid work the subject could be started on 
tests appropriate to his age, and he could thus in a very 
short time be given the tests in the neighborhood of his 
limit. The longer method is strongly recommended, how- 
ever, as the more reliable and the one to be followed, in view 
of the great importance of the results to the subject.

THE IMPORTANCE AND USES OF THE SCALE 
     
                      
   
                  
    
   The far-reaching importance of perfecting an intelligence 
scale, as viewed by these authors, is shown in their statement 
of its possible uses, once it has been constructed on a satis- 
factorily objective basis. ‘‘When the work, only outlined 
here, shall have taken on a definitive character, it will 
doubtless permit of the solution of many unsettled questions, 
since its object is nothing less than to measure intelligence ; 
thus it will be possible to compare differences of intellectual 
level not only according to age but also to sex, to social status, 
and to race. Applications of our methods will be found to 
normal anthropology and also to criminal anthropology, 
which touches closely the study of abnormal persons and of 
which the principal conclusions of this study will become a 
part” (page 246). 
THE CONCEPTION OF MENTAL-AGE LEVELS 
In this report the authors have clearly developed the idea 
of having a series of tests of increasing difficulty and of estab- 
lishing limits on the scale within which different classes 
of feeble-minded subjects will be ranged. They have also 
definitely grasped the conception of mental age levels — 
that is, levels of performance normal to children of the 
different ages who are neither retarded nor accelerated in 
mental development; and they have attempted to define the| 
three degrees of feeble-mindedness in terms of these mental 
age levels, so that the classification of any subnormal indi- 
vidual can be known once his mental age is determined. 
Thus if a feeble-minded person makes a test mental age o! 
six years, or scores equal to the average 6-year-old norma 
child, he will be classed, if he is not young, as an imbecile. 
Binet and Simon clearly recognize the advantage of statin 
a person’s retardation or advance in terms of the number o!
-P-A-G-E-197
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 183 
years that he is in retard or in advance of the norm for his 
age; but they do not yet face fully the question of how to 
classify defective children who, because of youth, still have 
before them some possibilities of growth. For instance, a 
10-year-old child scoring an age level of 6 years is evidently 
to become superior with greater age to an adult who just 
reaches this same mental age level. The authors point out 
that the younger defective has possibilities of further mental 
growth, but at the same time they are unable to suggest any 
one measure of universal application — such as the intelli- 
gence quotient later adopted by Stern and Terman — to 
designate the degree of intelligence of the subject irrespective 
of his age. Absolute retardation or acceleration in terms of 
mental-age units is obviously faulty as a description of one’s 
intelligence, because it means different things at different 
chronological ages —two years’ retardation, for instance, 
being much more serious in a young child than in an adoles- 
cent. 
Early references to mental age. The comparison of a person, 
defective in knowledge or in intelligence, with a normal child 
of a specific age did not originate with Binet. It seems to 
have been made in 1828 by Esquirol, in a general and some- 
what vague manner, when he pointed out that an idiot is 
incapable of acquiring the knowledge common to other 
persons of his own age (112). Duncan and Millard said in 
1866, “It is a very striking method of showing the mental 
deficiency of a member of any one of these classes to compare 
its mental gifts with those of children of perfect mind at 
younger ages”’(109, page 13). The classes referred to are the 
three degrees of feeble-mindedness, idiocy, imbecility, and 
moronity. Down likewise suggested comparing the mental 
condition of backward children with that of normal children 
two or more years younger, but he believed that in the case 
of an idiot child “there is no amount of imaginary antedated
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
age to which the present condition of the child corresponds” 
(104)! Pintner (174, page 33) calls attention to a report by 
Hall in 1848 of the trial of William Freeman, colored, charged 
with the murder of four persons unknown to him and for the 
killing of whom there was no provocation, in which Dr. 
Dimon, a psychiatrist, said that the accused “in point of 
knowledge was equal to a child of 3 years” (125). There is, 
however, a long way from such more or less casual compari- 
sons without any standardizations to a definite use of mental 
age as a unit of measurement in a scale. 
WHAT THE FIRST SCALE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED 
Binet and Simon recognize in this article that they have 
really as yet set up no satisfactory standards. They haye 
taken but small numbers of normal children for their norms, 
the groups of these children representing successive age 
differences of two years — 3, 5, 7,9, and 11 years; and they 
have used only children who are neither retarded nor ad- 
vanced in school. They recognize that all the children of 
any age, however classified as to grade in school, would have 
given more satisfactory norms, and that their scale must 
eventually be completed on age-norms of this sort for every 
year within certain limiting ages, each age group numbering 
above a hundred individuals, instead of approximately ten 
as in the present study. Thus they seem at this time to have 
anticipated rather clearly the principal changes that were 
to come in their later scales. The giving of more tests and 
the inclusion of each age within the limits of the scale are 
matters that embody no new principle, but simply assure 
greater accuracy and finer units of measurement. The 
year units, or units of a fraction of a year, later used were 
inevitable with further refinement. The authors are feeling 
1 These cases are taken from Woodrow’s Brightness and Dullness in Chil- 
dren (1919), page 25.
-P-A-G-E-199
  Binet’s First Intelligence Scale 185 
their way ahead in a truly empirical manner. Their own 
statement at the end of their report on the first scale and its 
use is both modest and promising of future progress : 
“We may be excused for not developing here a lengthy 
conclusion. A word will suffice. We have wished simply to 
show that it is possible to determine in a precise and truly 
scientific way the mental level of an intelligence, to compare 
this level with a normal level, and consequently to determine 
by how many years a child is retarded. Despite the inevi- 
table errors of a first work, which is of a groping character, 
we believe that we have demonstrated this possibility” (page 
336). 
EXERCISES 
1. Trace in earlier chapters the origin of as many of the thirty 
tests in the first Binet scale as you can. Indicate your results in 
the manner shown in Chapter 11 with the 1911 scale, except that 
you may refer to article and date instead of place in earlier scales. 
Be as careful as you can to get the real origin in every case. Go to 
the various sources if they are available to you. Which of the tests 
are traceable to sources outside of Binet’s own work ? 
2. What processes does the standardization of a test involve? 
State as many methods of standardization as you can, and point 
out the one essential thing in all of them. 
8. Write out your best possible definition of “mental age.”

CHAPTER TEN 
Later DEVELOPMENTS AND THE 1908 ScALE 
Bryer’s work on the intelligence scale was only a part of 
the many contributions of his day to the advancement of 
experimental psychology, a part that developed mainly, as 
we have seen, in work with subnormal individuals. Con- 
sequently many psychologists paid little or no attention to 
this work in applied psychology. Even the experimental 
work in the various psychological laboratories dealing directly 
with tests was concerned with such problems as the interre- 
lations of different mental functions, transfer effects, fatigue 
effects of continuous work, individual differences in particular 
tests, relative effects of heredity and environment, etc. 
Studies seeking to devise tests for the differentiation of 
persons according to their degrees of intelligence in a general 
way were few, outside of the laboratory conducted by Binet. 
TERMAN’S STUDY OF GENIUS AND STUPIDITY 
One piece of work on normal subjects, however, that 
approached the work of Binet previous to his preoccupation 
with the construction of an intelligence scale, was the study 
by Terman (206) of “genius and stupidity,” carried out in 
1904 and 1905 on seven boys judged to have superior intelli- 
gence and seven dull boys. These subjects were selected for 
extreme abilities by the teachers from about five hundred 
boys in the Worcester schools, near Clark University, the idea 
being to determine whether the tests used could make the 
discrimination between the two groups, that selected for 
mental superiority and that selected for the greatest stupidity. 
Terman’s idea regarding the importance of testing the higher 
complex processes, very much like that of Binet, is expressed 
as follows: “It is reasonable to suppose that the decisive 
186
-P-A-G-E-201
  Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 187 
intellectual differences among men are not greatly dependent 
upon native retentiveness or mere sense discrimination. 
~ Far more important than this mass of raw sense data is the 
correct shooting together of the sense elements in memory and 
imagination. This is invention. It is the synthetic or 
apperceptive activity that gives the ‘seven-league boots’ 
to genius. It is a kind of ability that all great minds exhibit. 
Why so great spontaneous relating activity in one mind and 
so little in another, is the ultimate problem in this portion of 
individual psychology” (page 15). 
While he admitted the similarity of all genius, he never- 
theless marked out tentatively three kinds of inventive 
genius, leading toward mechanical, artistic, and scientific 
or philosophical invention, respectively. Eight more or less 
different types of tests were used: tests (1) of “inventive or 
creative imagination”; (2) of logical processes; (3) of mathe- 
matical ability; (4) of “the mastery of language”; (5) of 
“insight, as shown in the interpretation of fables”; (6) of 
“ease of acquisition, as shown in learning to play chess”’; 
(7) of memory abilities; and (8) of “motor ability both in 
general and in the acquisition of bodily skill” (page 13). 
The inventive ingenuity tests consisted of the finding of a 
method of putting together into one long chain five short 
chains of three links each by means of only three weldings; 
the Thompson match test (see supra, page 115) ; the working 
out of a method by means of which a man traveling with a 
fox, a goose, and some corn may cross a river in a boat, 
taking only one of. these at a time in any direction, so that 
neither the goose (by the fox) nor the corn (by the goose) 
will be eaten while he is away from them; thinking out a 
method by which two boys and two men traveling together 
could get over a river in a boat that is capable of carrying only 
one man at a time or two boys; showing how a boy could 
measure out exactly four pints of water with a three-pint
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
a 
and a five-pint vessel; and arranging six pennies into two 
rows of four in each row. Material objects were used with 
some of these problems to aid in imaging the situation, and 
in the last problem the subject was told after a short period 
of failure that two coins might occupy the same place, one 
on top of the other. The “logical problems” were tracing a 
figure of two squares overlapping at one corner of each so as 
to form a small square common to each of the larger ones, the 
tracing to be done without crossing a line, lifting the pencil 
off the paper, or tracing any part of a line twice; tracing by 
the same rules the figure earlier used by Lindley (157) in 
his study of puzzles; solving different forms of the checker- 
puzzle test, which has recently been described by Haught 
(128); solving various arithmetic problems, some of them 
involving simple fractions; making change, a test used by 
Binet soon after this in his 1908 scale; finding the relative 
amounts for two or more men to pay for a carriage rented at 
a fixed price, each of the men riding a different distance ; 
finding the costs of two articles when the total cost and the 
excess cost of the one over the other article are given; and 
developing a general rule in the Binet paper-folding test. 
The language tests consisted of reading for accuracy and 
speed, making words from certain sets of given letters, the 
Ebbinghaus completion test, a sort of composition test of 
“expression,” and the execution of thirty commands with 
respect to the moving of chessmen on a chessboard. Other 
tests used, which are now well known, were the interpretation 
of fables; a number of tests of memory — reproduction of a 
complex geometrical figure (from Binet), oral and written 
reproduction of stories, and the solution of a mechanical 
puzzle after seeing the operation performed by the experi- 
menter; and a number of tests of motor ability. 
In the mental tests the seven boys selected for superior 
ability clearly excelled as a group the seven dull boys, the
-P-A-G-E-203
Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 189 
difference, however, being least in the case of the ingenuity 
tests; but in the motor-ability tests the dull boys were 
superior. “On the whole,” says the author, “the standing 
of the individual subjects through the separate tests is strik- 
ingly uniform. This is only another way of saying that 
intelligence in these subjects does not show a decided tend- 
ency to develop along special lines” (page 68). The possi- 
bility of constructing tests of general mental ability was 
thus shown. 
Terman sent a copy of his monograph to Binet! in 1906. 
It is not known whether the work embodied in this mono- 
graph influenced the 1908 scale, but it seems probable that 
the making-change test and the executing-commands test, 
first appearing in this scale, came from Terman’s work. 
When the Binet scale first appeared, a number of psycholo- 
gists were employed in work of such a nature that they 
found in it much that was of value to them. Indeed, so 
pressing were the needs for an intelligence scale by which to 
classify children according to different degrees of defective- 
ness that developments toward scale construction, as we have 
already seen, were going on in several quarters. 
THE DE SANCTIS TESTS 
Sante de Sanctis, of the University of Rome, published, 
in the year following the appearance of Binet’s scale, a series 
of six tests (98) to be used especially on feeble-minded 
children from 7 to 16 years of age. The author of these 
tests believed that they would enable one to discover in the 
child his capacity of adaptation to situations, his memory of 
colors, recognition of certain forms, persistent attention, 
judgment of the number, size, and distance of objects, 
reasoning on relations of objects not present to sense and on 
their several qualities, and his quickness in such mental 
1 This information was obtained from Professor Terman in a letter.  
-P-A-G-E-204
  190 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
operations as perception, action on commands, and thinking. 
The tests, which the English reader will find in Whipple’s 
Manual of Mental and Physical Tests (1910), consist of 
(1) giving the tester one ball of five at hand when asked to do 
so, the balls all having different colors; (2) immediately 
indicating from memory which ball was taken when the five 
are again shown the subject; (8) selecting five cubes from a 
collection of these cubes with three pyramids and two 
parallelopipeds; (4) selecting or indicating all the squares 
on a test card containing different printed forms (squares, 
rectangles twice as long as wide, and equilateral triangles) ; 
(5) counting twelve cubes and indicating the largest and the 
most distant one; and (6) answering these questions: (a) Are 
big things heavier or lighter than small things? (b) How is 
it that small things are sometimes heavier than big things? 
(c) Which looks bigger, a thing that is close by or a thing 
that is far away? (d) When things are far away, do they 
just look smaller or are they really smaller? The time is 
recorded with a stop watch in each test, and speed and 
accuracy of responses are taken into consideration in rating 
the subject tested. 
These tests were not standardized well either as to pro- 
cedure in giving or in scoring the tests, but it was asserted 
that inability to pass tests 1 and 2 indicates a high degree 
of defectiveness, while inability to pass the next two or three 
tests shows but slight mental deficiency. Normal per- 
formances, including time and number of errors for the 
several ages, were not given by the author. These tests, 
as well as those by Binet and Simon, were used in Europe 
and in America and promised to give good results for the 
purposes of certain rough classifications by non-literary tests ; 
but they soon became so much overshadowed by the revised 
Binet scales that at the present writing — less than twenty 
years after the appearance of the De Sanctis tests — it is
-P-A-G-E-205
  Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 191 
probable that only a very small per cent of persons using 
tests, but not specially trained in psychology, know anything 
about them or have ever heard the name of their author. 
REACTIONS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO THE 1905 BINET SCALE    
   
    
    
           
    
   
                Despite the recognition that Binet had attained by 1905, 
his first scale was to become known to the world mainly 
through the use made of it, and the criticisms of it, by workers 
with defectives. The year after its appearance brought out a 
long critical article by Decroly and Degand (94) of Belgium, 
who had applied this test scale to defective children. Their 
analysis of results showed that, while there was a rather 
close correspondence between the ranking of these children 
by the test and the ranking based on their school success, 
on clinical determinations, and on general observations of 
their behavior, certain modifications and additions were 
desirable. Aside from various changes suggested for adapt- 
ing the tests for use on deaf-mutes, these authors urged that 
tests stressing “active intelligence, alertness, or logic in 
action” be added to supplement those putting stress prin- 
cipally on memory. They also suggested modifications in 
some of the tests to reduce their length and the amount of 
needless repetition required by them.! They found that the 
tests in this scale were not arranged in an exact order of in- 
creasing difficulty so far as abnormal subjects are concerned, 
a fact that the authors of the scale had themselves in a meas- 
ure discovered, and also that the scale was least serviceable 
for children of but slight defectiveness. 
Dr. Goddard translated this scale into English for use in 
the Vineland school (118), but in this same year a revision, 
or a new scale, by Binet and Simon had alread;    1A good summary of their results with twenty-five children is found in 
Whipple, op. cit., page 491.
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
THE APPEARANCE OF THE NEW INTELLIGENCE SCALE 
This new scale bore the significant title, The Development 
of Intelligence in Children (61). The interest has now_ 
shifted from defectives to normal children. Intelligence is 
now a subject of wide interest. The authors tell us that 
there has been no more often repeated expression in psy- 
chology the last few years than “the measurement of intelli- 
gence.” They say that their earlier work in attempting an 
approximation to such measurement was much less elaborated 
or perfected than that which they now present. The purpose 
in the report now before us is, first, to become acquainted 
with the law of the mental development of children and to 
devise a method of diagnosing their intelligence; and, second, 
to study the diversity of their intellectual aptitudes. Their 
interest is, however, still pedagogical to a large extent, for 
they hope to show that certain parts of the instructional 
program for children is not well adapted to their receptivity. 
“The child differs from the adult not only in degree and 
in quantity, but also in the very form of its intelligence” 
(page 2). They found the problem relating to intelligence 
more complex than they imagined it to be: “our minds 
always simplify nature.” 
It now appears to these investigators that making the 
program of studies of children agree with the development 
of their intelligence constitutes a new problem; but they 
repeat that their tests are useful not only to psychology 
but “to mental medicine and to medico-legal surveys”’ as 
well (page 3). The three methods of exploring intelligence — 
the medical, the pedagogical, and the psychological — are 
again pointed out, although as before, and even more strictly 
here, only the last method can be considered. The idea of a 
metrical scale of intelligence is clearly stated, and the im- 
portance is stressed, above all, of describing the tests with a
-P-A-G-E-207

precision so exact that every person who takes the pains to 
understand and use them may give them correctly. 
While for the history of the scale the reader is referred by 
the authors to their earlier articles of 1905, we are told that 
“M. Decroly and Mlle. Degand have undertaken to verify 
our first researches with a care that pleases us,” and that the 
Pedagogical Society of Brussels has included these researches 
on intelligence testing in its program of work. It is im- 
portant to note that all the experiments on this new scale 
were carried out in two mental hospitals and in the primary 
and maternal schools of Paris on children of the working 
class. 
We shall here give only an outline statement of the new 
scale in question, as English translations are easily accessible 
to interested readers (119; 231, pages 493-517; 151).

RELATIONS OF THE NEW TO THE OLD SCALE 
It is not clear that Binet and Simon regarded the 1908 
scale as a-revision of the earlier scale, which they largely 
disregarded in the discussion of the later one. It is probable 
that they regarded it as a development and refinement of 
ithe first scale. That the new scale, moreover, is not simply 
independent of the first one, and therefore to be used only 
or normal subjects, is evident from the fact that the authors 
ave applied it to subnormal as well as to normal subjects 
nd that they define in the present article the different degrees 
f feeble-mindedness much more precisely than they had 
one in connection with the first scale. Under these cir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
196 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
cumstances it is probably best to regard the second intelli- 
gence scale as a substitute for the first one, this view being 
supported by the fact that it is arranged into tests for all 
the different year levels from 3 to 13 years, inclusive. 
It will be recalled, too, that in the 1905 article the authors 
had set their problem rather to show that a scale could be 
constructed for the measurement of the level of any given 
intelligence and the determination of the amount of its 
retardation; and this they claimed to have demonstrated, 
even though all the year-levels were not represented in their 
tests. The task undertaken in the later work was, therefore, 
to do what they had earlier shown to be a possibility. It 
cannot be denied, however, that the 1905 scale was regarded 
as a means of practical helpfulness in researches until the 
perfection of the better tool had been accomplished. It 
was but natural, then, that their attention should go to the 
new scale to the practical exclusion of the old one, once the 
former was worked out. 
HOW THESE TWO SCALES DIFFER 
As we noted in the previous chapter, the concept of mental 
age had been clearly arrived at in the articles published in 
1905, but it was not worked out completely in the first scale 
even for the year-levels there represented. These two 
scales differ most, therefore, in the fact that in the second 
one groups of tests for each age-level within the limits men- 
tioned are given; that is, different groups of tests have been 
located experimentally in the different year-levels so that the 
mental age in exact years can be determined for any subject 
tested. Thus there are tests in one group which the normal 
38-year-old child should pass, tests which the normal 4-year- 
old child should pass, tests for the 5-year-olds, and so on, 
up through the 13th year. But it is important to note tha’ 
an equal number of tests had not been provided for eac
-P-A-G-E-211
  Late: “Developments and the 1908 Scale 197 
year-level, an irregularity that was, with a single exception, 
corrected in the 1911 scale. This arrangement of tests 
suitable for the different ages is known as standardization 
of the tests. Simply devising the tests is quite a different 
matter from standardizing them, and it was on this latter 
point in particular that Binet went beyond other test makers 
of his time. 
      
   
                             THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE TESTS 
How were these tests standardized? The authors of the 
scale leave us no very definite answer to this question, but 
their data and comments on the placement of different tests 
make two things clear: first, that no very precise method 
was used, and, second, that roughly speaking, any test was 
considered to belong in the year in which it was passed 
successfully by about a half to eight or nine tenths of the 
normal children. Obviously, if 75 per cent of the children 
of a given age passed a certain test, this would mean that 
the middle 50 per cent had just passed, and it is not a bad 
practice to judge any group by what can be accomplished 
by the middle half of them when they are arranged in an 
order ranging from the most to the least able. Thus in 
Figure 2 each hundredth of the area under the curve repre- 
sents a child of a given age, say of 9 years. The imaginary 
hundred children are supposed to be fair representatives of 
fall children of just 9 years of age. Since they do not all have 
qual ability, they are distributed all along the scale of 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ability from the low point of efficiency, A, to the high point 
B, and just fifty, or half of them, are located between the 
vertical lines limiting the shaded area. There are very few 
extremely inefficient or extremely efficient children, and the 
number at any point constantly increases from these extremes 
toward the position av on the scale, which marks average 
ability. At this point is found the greatest number of 
children of any single degree of ability, as is shown by the 
fact that here the curve is highest. Now, it may be main- 
tained that a test situation which all the children to the right 
of the vertical line Z can pass, but which cannot be passed by 
the children to the left of this line, will theoretically be a 
proper test for 9-year-olds; for such a test will be just 
passed by the entire middle half of the group, and also, of 
course, by the one-fourth who are above this middle group 
in ability. 
It was evidently this situation which Binet had in mind in 
a general way in his work of standardization of the scale, 
but it is to be noted that his tables show a wide variation 
in the percentage passing any test at age. Why, then, did) 
he not approximate more accurately a passing percentage of 
75 for each test in the year appropriate to it? The answer 
is based on a purely practical matter, which will hardly occur| 
to readers who have not had some experience in standardizing] 
tests, but which forces itself upon one with the first experience 
of this kind. It takes a good deal of thought and work to 
devise tests that are suitable for the measurement of intelli 
gence, and even when they have been prepared it is only . 
rare test that will happen to be just hard enough to let 7. 
per cent of the children of any age-group pass. Most of th 
tests will let a greater or a smaller percentage through. 
only 40 or 50 per cent of, say, the 6-year-olds pass the test. 
it may happen that nearly 75 per cent of the 7-year-old: 
will pass, but rarely will this percentage be just right, an     
   
    
    
    
        
       
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 199 
whether or not it will approximate 75 very closely no one 
can say in advance of trying it on the children. So the 
experimenter must throw aside the hope of getting enough 
tests that are just correctly placed, and must resort to 
approximations. That is what Binet did, but he doubtless 
tried to get into each age level tests which would on the whole 
be about right, some being slightly too easy and some too 
hard — that is, some being passed by too large and some by 
too small a percentage. 
Other difficulties confronted him. It was not easy, for 
instance, to select children who were just representative of 
the age groups to be considered. How could he know just 
what children it would be best to take? Two conditions 
sent him to the public schools of Paris for the children. One 
of these was his strong interest in getting some tool that 
would be helpful in the educational process, an interest that 
is everywhere prominent in his work, and the other one was 
that it would be very hard to get subjects for his tests if he 
did not go to the schools. We shall consider later the accu- 
racy of his selections as norms for the different age groups, 
saying here only that the children selected were largely from 
the poorer classes. , Despite Binet’s distrust of theoretical 
procedures in scientific work, he was in this case forced to 
adopt a theoretical point of view in the construction of this 
year-scale, or “metrical scale of intelligence,” and to select 
subjects and standardize his data of the tests in accordance 
with the requirements of this point of view. 
Nevertheless, the tests in the scale were arranged into 
year groups and into their general order by an empirical 
procedure, by actual trials of what children could do, and 
not by any ideas of the authors as to what they ought to do 
at different ages. “First,” they tell us, “it is to be noted 
that our tests are really arranged in the actual order of in- 
creasing difficulty. It is only after many trials that we have
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
established this order, and we did not at all conceive it as it 
now stands. If we had left the field open to our conjecture, 
we should certainly not have admitted that the span of time 
between 4 and 7 years is necessary for a child able to repeat 
three digits to become able to repeat five digits. Likewise, 
we should never have believed that not before 10 years of age 
are the majority of children able to recite accurately in order 
the series of months without forgetting more than one of 
them, or that not before this age is reached does the normal 
child know all the pieces of our money” (page 71). That is 
to say, when they came down to actual tests under controlled 
and constant conditions, they found that the abilities of the 
children were much more limited than they had supposed. 
This discovery has been supported in later testing work. 
In practical life each person is free to lead out, in conversa- 
tion and in performance, in.the things that he knows best 
or can do best; so, judging him by these performances, we 
overrate his ability. 
Aside from the practical limitation on the accurate place- 
ment of the tests in the scale, which we have noted, it should 
be mentioned also that Binet and Simon did not employ 
enough children to standardize their scale accurately. “We 
have made the experiment at length,” they tell us, “in the 
primary schools and maternal schools for boys in Paris on 
children who were within two months of the ages 3, 4, 5, and 
so on, to 12 years; we have studied individually 203 children, 
each of whom was examined in a sitting which lasted at 
least half an hour” (ibid.). This number of children we now 
know from numerous experiments to be far from sufficient 
for all these several year groups, so that the authors’ 
standardization of the tests, and their placement of the 
several tests in the scale, was by no means as exact as might 
be desired.

Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 201 
PRACTICAL CHECKS ON THE ACCURACY OF THE SCALE 
The authors suggested and tried several checks on the 
accuracy of their scale. One of the simplest of these, they 
said, would be to find the number of children missing the 
tests of a given age and passing those of a higher age. Their 
scale was confirmed by the fact that of over seventy children 
examined with this check in view not one was found who 
passed a higher age than one he missed. Another test of the 
accuracy of the standardization of the scale proposed by them 
is this: Do a large percentage of the children-tested by the 
scale pass the tests of the age corresponding to their own 
chronological ages? They found that all the children of a 
given age did not get equal rating and thus test true to age, 
some being advanced and some retarded. This, however, 
favors the scale, for, as they say, a test that would make equal 
all the children of a given age would be known to be wrong, 
for it is well established that children of equal age vary con- 
siderably in ability. But, as a third test of the accuracy 
of the scale, we should expect to find that the number of 
children testing below age, or retarded, would equal the 
number testing above age, or advanced; and, as a fourth 
criterion of accuracy, we may expect that in the comparison 
of successive ages the retarded children of the higher age are 
fewer than the number testing normal of the next lower age, 
and that the accelerated of any age are also fewer than those 
testing normal of the next higher age. Or, stated differently, 
their fourth criterion amounts to this: If the scale is accurate, 
we should expect that the number of children testing just 
normal at any age will be greater than the number testing 
either above or below normal. 
The data offered by the authors do not show their scale to 
be perfect on all these criteria, but the number of subjects 
in the several age groups is too small for a reliable evaluation
-P-A-G-E-216
  202 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
of the scale. Of the whole group of 203 children, the authors 
found that 103 got mental-age rankings by the tests that 
agreed with their true ages; that 42 were given a mental 
age one year in advance of their true, or chronological, age, 
and 2 were two years advanced, while 44 were retarded one 
year and 12 two years. This shows more retarded than 
advanced, but the children were probably hardly up to the 
standard of ability that would be representative of the age 
groups studied. 
THE VALIDITY OF THE SCALE 
These were not all the tests of the validity of their scale 
that the authors attempted. They also had children selected 
for their superior ability by the teachers and found that these 
children were invariably ranked as advanced by the tests. 
On the other hand, 14 children who were three years behind 
their normal grades in school were tested and found to be 
retarded mentally by an average of 2.5 years, or by amounts 
ranging from 1 to 6 years. However, Binet did not believe 
that scholastic ability is just the same thing as intellectual 
ability. The former, he held, depends a good deal on atten- 
tion to school work, on will, and on a certain kind of char- 
acter, —e.g., a degree of docility, a regularity of habits, — 
and above all on continuity of effort. Not all intelligent 
children have these traits, and therefore many of them do not 
do as well in school as they could do with better application ; 
but all apply themselves well in the test under the conditions 
of the shortness of time and of the presence of the tester. 
“The insufficiencies of attention; of character, and of will 
do not,” the authors say, “appear to give trouble in our 
intelligence examination; the test is too short and the child 
is not sufficiently abandoned to himself. In fact, we have 
never in our examinations come across an inattentive child, 
save in the case of those of 3 or 4 years of age. All gave good
-P-A-G-E-217
  Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 203 
effort; they were close to us and our very presence would 
suffice to prevent a deflection of attention”’ (page 75). 
There is therefore reason to believe that the ranking of 
subjects by the tests is in most of the cases of disagreement 
more accurate than that based on school work. It was 
found that even abnormal children, presumably weak in 
attention, did not fail to respond in a whole-hearted manner 
to the tests; but while the difference in concentration 
between such individuals and normal children did not show 
up in the tests, it did appear when groups of children were 
seated around tables in a cancellation test and were given 
the problem of crossing out certain specified letters in a page 
of print. The authors did not, however, make any effort to 
determine by suitable control tests whether the differences 
thus brought out between children of poor and of good con- 
centration were really not due to other factors than intelli- 
gence — such, for instance, as speed or previous training of 
some sort. 
f EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENT AND TRAINING ON THE SCORES 
The authors of the scale admit that responses to certain of 
their tests are considerably influenced by the previous train- 
ing of the subject, especially when tests call for information 
of some sort that children might learn to the extent of their 
opportunities or school training; and they point out such 
tests as naming colors and giving the days of the week as most 
subject to the influence of general experience and training, 
chiefly extra-scholastic. On the other hand, the arrange- 
ment of the weights, the giving of definitions superior to use 
and definitions of abstract terms, and the interpretation of 
pictures are mentioned as the tests least under the influence 
of these factors. These tests were held to give the most ade- 
quate expression of spontaneous intelligence in the child (page 
79). Other tests, such as counting backwards from 20 to 0 and
-P-A-G-E-218
  204 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
giving memories from a selection read, are mentioned as 
most influenced by specific scholastic training, and we are 
informed that children most often test at age on these because 
such tests require a basis of scholastic training that is re- 
ceived just at the age in question. 
It is not so important to us nowadays to keep in mind which 
tests were put into each group by Binet, as his conclusions 
were often arrived at on too meager data; but it is important 
to note that he explicitly recognized that the scale was not 
independent of the amount of opportunity that the subject 
has had to learn some of the things called for in the tests. 
While it is true that responses to informational tests depend 
on opportunity as one factor — and Binet’s tests were not 
all, and very few were markedly of this sort — it was sup- 
posed that with environment nearly equal, as it generally is 
among children of the same class and neighborhood, the child 
with the best intelligence would naturally have gathered the 
most information, so that, otherwise stated, the child with 
the greater intelligence would have as a consequence of this 
a greater store of information and skill. In other words, 
Binet held definitely, and he explicitly so stated, that the 
intelligence measured by the scale is not independent of a 
group of concrete circumstances; it is a complex of (1) “‘in- 
telligence pure and simple,” (2) extra-scholastic acquisitions, 
(3) scholastic acquisitions which have in each child’s experi- 
ence a date somewhat fixed by the curriculum, and (4) acqui- 
sitions relative to language and vocabulary, both scholastic 
and extra-scholastic. 
Would the scale, then, do injustice to one of a high intelli- 
gence level who had been deprived, or largely deprived, of 
scholastic culture relative to his degree of intelligence? 
“We do not think so,’”’ the authors say. ‘‘The person of 
great innate qualities shows his superiority in the repetition 
of numbers, the repetition of sentences, the drawing of a
-P-A-G-E-219
  
Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 205 
design cut in a quarto-folded paper, the arrangement of 
weights, the interpretation of pictures, etc.; and it is espe- 
cially the province of these tests, when this need is evident, 
to isolate from the scholastic effects the real native intelli- 
gence” (page 80). But even granting this superiority of the 
tests named, we must note that they are not sufficient in 
variety or number to make an adequate scale, and that 
therefore to get very accurate results allowance would have to 
be made for marked differences in the environment of 
children; and the authors in their practical testing did make 
such allowance, a fact of which their writings show ample 
evidence. 
MATURITY AND RECTITUDE OF INTELLIGENCE 
Binet held that we should distinguish two aspects of 
intelligence usually confounded — maturity of intelligence 
and rectitude of intelligence (pages 80 ff.). The former of 
these is the result of mental growth with age, but it may 
appear early in a child, when he is termed precocious. 
It is the opposite of a childish quality of intelligence. 
Maturity of intelligence, or its lack, is revealed by four tests 
particularly: the giving of definitions, the construction of a 
sentence to include three given words, the explanation of 
pictures, and the arrangement of weights. The definitions 
given by a child with a fair maturity of intelligence are 
superior to those which merely give the use of the object or 
its relation to oneself. Such a child makes a sentence 
possessing unity, not one consisting merely of three distinct 
ideas, one for each word, connected with “and.” In ex- 
plaining a picture, he interprets instead of merely enumerat- 
ing. He displays method and efficiency in arranging the 
weights. 
Rectitude of intelligence, on the other hand, is not in- 
compatible with the most early age and shows itself in the
-P-A-G-E-220
  206 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
meaningfulness and accuracy of responses and in the avoid- 
ance of absurdities. A good illustration of a response reveal-. 
ing maturity of intelligence with a lack of rectitude was given 
by a feeble-minded adult who declared that the picture 
shown him represented a scene which took place in the month 
of February, an entirely unwarranted detail which, of course, 
could neither be confirmed nor denied. It is probable that 
the distinction here made by Binet is more or less artificial. 
He himself regarded it as tentative. 
These and many other ideas and incidental problems raised 
by Binet show how tentative and expanding his conception 
of intelligence was, and how far he was removed from a 
certain dogmatism and finality manifested in the work of 
testers of less insight, many of them even of our own day. 
SOME APPLICATIONS OF THE SCALE 
With respect to applications of the scale to the realm of 
normal children, Binet and his colleague urged that the 
curriculum should be adapted to the degree of intelligence of 
the children of the different grades, so that at each stage the 
tasks assigned the children would not be beyond the abilities 
possessed by them to do and to assimilate. They deplored 
the system according to which history is taught to children 
who, as the tests show, do not yet know morning from 
afternoon (page 28). “Instruction,” they say, “should be 
designed to follow the march of the natural development of 
the child, at the same time hastening it a little; but it is a 
vain effort to precede it by three or four years, as is actually 
being done through ignorance, by trying to inculcate in 
babies of 5 or 6 years what only boys of 9 years can retain” 
(page 38). Moreover, teachers adapt the work to the chil- 
dren in a general way, getting one sort of evidence of the 
fitness of the adaptation from this child and another from 
that one, but not making the work suitable to the sevéral|
-P-A-G-E-221
  
Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 207 
abilities of the particular children. As a consequence great 
maladjustment in school work results, and many children 
have tasks that are not suited to their requirements. The 
value, both to parents and to teachers, of accurate mental 
tests of children is pointed out clearly. 
But the authors believe that the greatest service of the 
scale lies not in the application to normal but to subnormal 
children, or children inferior in intelligence. The very great 
benefit of the tests to children of super-normal intelligence 
was not at this time clearly perceived, but the recognition 
of this benefit has been one of the contributions of the testing 
movement in our own day. In the 1908 article the dis- 
cussion and characterization of the three degrees of feeble- 
mindedness is considerably advanced over that in the earlier 
Binet publications, and are worth considering here in some 
detail. The value of the scale in this realm is shown by the 
helplessness of authorities without it. Conscientious physi- 
cians trying to classify feeble-minded cases speak of light 
and of profound moronity, but give not a word of the real 
difference otherwise. ‘“‘It is as if one should say that we have 
in Paris 43 per cent tall and 42 per cent short men, without 
defining either class; or as if the law on military recruiting 
decided that to be enrolled the conscript ought to have 
a reasonable height’ (page 85). These vague notions of 
classification are then accompanied in certain statistical 
publications by figures, as if they meant something very 
definite. We are told that if a normal child, by some mis- 
chance, is presented to a clinic the alienist is unable to 
recognize it as normal. 
CHARACTERIZATIONS OF IDIOTS, IMBECILES, AND MORONS 
Binet and Simon now attempt definitions and characteri- 
zations of the three degrees of feeble-mindedness and also 
a statement of their limits in terms of the scores on the scale. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  208 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
The idiot. The lowest grade of feeble-mindedness is idiocy. 
“An idiot is a person who is not able to communicate with 
his fellows by means of language. He does not talk at all, 
and does not understand. He corresponds to the intelligence 
level of a normal child ranging from early infancy to 2 years 
of age” (page 87). To differentiate the idiot from the im- 
becile it suffices to employ the following tests: the carry- 
ing out of such orders as to touch nose, mouth, eyes; and 
the naming and indicating of some familiar and easy objects 
shown in a picture. 
The imbecile. The line between the imbecile and the 
moron, they say, is just as easy to establish as that between 
the two lower grades. “The imbecile is a person who is 
incapable of communicating with his fellows by means of 
written language; he is unable therefore either to read, 
comprehending what he reads, or to write intelligently, 
either under dictation or spontaneously” (page 87). Were 
it not for the possibility of the subject’s being illiterate 
because of the lack of schooling, two 8-year-old tests would 
suffice to distinguish between imbecile and moron, — reading 
a passage and remembering two items, and writing short 
sentences with pen and ink; but to these must be added, for 
the reason suggested, other 7- and 8-year tests, — describing 
pictures, counting up the value of some simple coins, and 
giving differences between two objects recalled in memory. 
The moron. It is difficult to make the distinction between 
the moron and the lower grade of dull persons who would be 
called normal, as the borderline is not fixed but varies with 
circumstances. “The most general formula we can adopt 
is this: An individual is normal if he is able to conduct his 
affairs of life without having need of the supervision of others, 
if he is able to do work sufficiently remunerative to supply 
his own personal needs, and, finally, if his intelligence does 
not unfit him for the social environment of his parents”
-P-A-G-E-223
  . Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 209 
(page 88). Binet held that the son of a lawyer, for instance, 
who is reduced by his limitation of intelligence to the condi- 
tion of a small-job employee, is a moron, as is also the son 
of a master mason who at the age of thirty is still a mason’s 
assistant. A peasant may be normal in his simple environ- 
ment in the country but be a moron in the city, where con- 
ditions are more complex. In other words, retardation was 
regarded as a relative affair, dependent on many circum- 
stances, and the authors prefer tentative distinctions because 
of this fact. Twenty cases tested by them in hospitals for 
defectives had given intellectual levels not passing 9 or 10 
years. A 14-year-old imbecile of a 5-year mental age level, 
they pointed out, may recite without error the names of the 
days of the week and of the months of the year, and may 
name colors and pieces of money — some of which tests, the 
reader will note, were in the 10-year group — because he has 
profited more by his longer experience in these things, which 
he can learn, than has the normal 5-year-old child. 
Tests to detect moronity. If, then, we leave out of con- 
sideration these tests of simple notions which the adult 
moron has usually acquired, there remain certain tests which 
he cannot pass. The authors name the following ones as 
forming, for the population of the Paris district studied by 
them, the line between moronity and normality: arranging 
weights, giving correct responses to questions of difficult 
comprehension, constructing sentences containing three 
given words, defining abstract terms, interpreting pictures, 
and finding rimes. These tests, taken from the 9- to the 12- 
year levels, were found by experiment to be too difficult for 
persons properly classed as morons. None of the twenty 
morons they tested passed even three of these tests, though 
some passed one or two. It is important to note that with 
these defectives they did not hold simply to the tests of a 
certain year-level for making the distinction. “All our work
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
has shown that intelligence is measured by a synthesis of 
results,” they say, and not by a special localized success 
(page 89). They hesitate to give even these six crucial tests, 
fearing that they may seem to suggest a dangerous precision ; 
for there are many conditions to consider, and it is only in a 
general way that it may be said that passing at least four of 
these tests shows one’s normality. Moreover, normality 
as thus established may exist with accentuated instability, 
or with certain irresistible impulsions or other pathological 
conditions grave enough for the subject’s internment. 
In the diagnosis of a young defective person, whose men- 
tality is not yet mature, it is necessary to take into account 
age as well as present mental ability. How shall these factors 
be combined? “We shall not know the answer for certain,” 
say Binet and Simon, “until a broad experience will finally 
haye taught us what we do not yet know, — how the idiot, 
the imbecile, and the moron develop, and what prognosis 
can be made on the basis of a particular amount of retarda- 
tion at a given age” (pages 90 f.). The results of tests of 
supposedly normal children indicated that a mental arrest 
of one year, as determined by the tests, is so frequent as to 
lose significance. A retardation of two years, however, is 
sufficiently rare to be met with in only 7 per cent of the cases 
and may therefore indicate a probability of defectiveness. 
Their procedure, then, is to class those children who test 
two years or more under the mental level of their chrono- 
logical age, with the adult defectives who pass the same tests, 
while those children who by the tests are found to have only 
one year of retardation are considered normal. The group- 
ings of feeble-minded persons by mental age are: 0 to 2 years, 
idiots; 2 to 7 years, imbeciles; and above 7 years, morons. 
This system of determining feeble-mindedness and its 
degree of mental age is obviously unfair in certain particulars, 
especially to the younger children. A child of 5 years of age
-P-A-G-E-225
Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 211 
who just passes the 3-year tests would be classed near the 
lower limits of imbecility, while another child but a year 
younger who passes the same tests would be considered 
normal. Recognizing this injustice, Binet and Simon admit 
that the classification has no prognostic value for any child, 
but only a present value. “He who is an imbecile today 
may perhaps become a moron with the progress of age, or he 
may, on the contrary, remain an imbecile all his life. One 
cannot tell” (page 91). 
SCHOLASTIC STANDING AS SUPPLEMENTARY 
TO RATING BY TESTS 
These investigators used the scholastic standing as a check 
on the test classification of children. They regarded as 
feeble-minded any child who was three years or more retarded 
in the school grade, provided that frequent absence or 
irregularity in attendance could not account for the failure 
of normal promotion. Therefore Binet considered that 
taking the school standing into consideration in connection 
with the test rating it would be possible in most cases to 
arrive at a fair conclusion as to whether a given individual 
should be classed as a moron or not. He and Simon cite 
cases of children who were three years retarded in school 
but whom the tests showed to be arrested mentally but one 
year, and who could therefore not be considered morons. 
The reverse condition, serious mental retardation with a 
normal scholastic progress, was apparently more rare, and 
it would need more study, for often teachers promote children 
in the lower grades largely on the basis of age. 
Thus in the 1908 report Binet and Simon bring down their 
definitions and characterizations of the degrees of feeble- 
mindedness to more strictly drawn points in terms of the 
tests than formerly, but they still fail to deal successfully 
with the matter of age in relation to the degree of defective- 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  
  212 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ness in children. It is obvious that the absolute amount of 
retardation, whether mental or scholastic, is not a safe guide ; 
for a retardation of, say, two years is certainly much more 
grave in the case of a 10-year-old child than in that of one 
who is 15 years old. This point Binet never did solve 
satisfactorily. 
SOME WEAKNESSES OF THE 1908 SCALE 
This 1908 scale was not itself free from important weak- 
nesses. Aside from the imperfect standardization made 
evident in subsequent work with the scale, both in Europe 
and in America, there was the fact, indeed noticed but not 
corrected by the authors, that certain tests were considerably 
dependent on school and extra-school experience. With 
such tests in the scale it was very important that the results 
be taken seriously only when the subjects tested had all 
had approximately equal opportunities. This defect, though 
obvious enough, is not easily removed, as any one acquainted 
with modern testing knows; but it is important to empha- 
size it here, because it so often happens that inexperienced 
testers leave out of consideration the element of unequal 
opportunity to learn the things called for in certain mental 
tests. The desirable thing would, of course, be to have tests 
that measure only pure intelligence, whatever that may be; 
but such a scale we do not yet possess, for no mental function 
is independent of external influences of some sort. There 
are, however, tests that are probably very little influenced 
by the subject’s past experiences. 
Another defect of the 1908 scale is the inequality of the 
number of tests in the different year levels, this number 
ranging from three in the 13th to eight in the 7th year. This 
scale, like the 1905 scale, is also defective in the fact that 
instructions for giving and scoring the several tests were not 
standardized satisfactorily. Various children can be com-
-P-A-G-E-227
  Later Developments and the 1908 Scale 213 
pared on the same set of tests only when the latter have 
been administered in a thoroughly objective manner, and 
when the instructions have carried the same meaning to all 
of them. The problem of securing a satisfactory degree of 
objectivity in tests is a very important one, and is not fully 
settled even in our own day. 
DIRECTIONS AS TO METHODS OF SCORING 
With the 1908 scale Binet and Simon gave definite in- 
structions as to how to find the mental age of the subjects 
tested, even though they neglected to standardize satis- 
factorily the responses to many of the tests and to indicate 
what sort of response to each would be considered a pass. 
They found that rarely will a subject be able to pass all the 
tests up to the end of any one year and fail in all above this 
point. How, then, shall the mental age be determined? 
The rule adopted is this: The subject is first to be given the 
mental age of the highest year level in which he passes all 
the tests, with a possible exception of one test. To this basic 
year level is to be added an additional year for every five 
tests that he passes in higher levels. In the application 
of this last part of the rule the error of having a variable 
number of tests in the several year-levels becomes obvious. 
Let us take an example to make the rule for scoring clear. 
If a child passes all but one of the tests in the 9-year level 
and likewise all but one in the 10-year level, then on this 
record alone he would have a mental age of 10 years. If, 
in addition to this, he should also pass three tests of the 
11-year group and two of the 12-year group, his mental age, 
or “intelligence level,” would be 11 years. But if he should 
pass only four tests above the 10-year level, his mental age 
would be but 10 years. In the 1911 scale, presently to be 
considered, the rule was so modified as to permit of the 
addition of a fractional part of a year.

  214 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
TWO STRONG POINTS OF THE SCALE 
We must not overlook the important fact that the com- 
pletion of this scale marks a step in the progress of intelligence 
testing that is surpassed only by the appearance of the 1905 
scale, which not only established the possibility of such a 
scale, but outlined the general plan to be followed in its 
construction. The correction of the inevitable errors in 
such a work is but a secondary matter, and was sure to follow. 
The two things about this new scale that gave it the advan- 
tages which subsequent years have shown it had over all 
other mental-testing devices to the date of its appearance, 
are doubtless these: first, the adoption of the method of 
simple mental age units, easily understood, even by non- 
technically trained persons; and, second, the application 
to each subject of several tests calling into play a variety of 
mental functions.

Eva.uations or THE Binet Metsop or TESTING AND 
THE SCALE or 1911 
CRITICAL EVALUATIONS OF THE 1908 SCALE IN 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
Tue publication in 1908 of a scale more accurate and 
complete than the first one had stimulated a good deal of 
investigation in various localities. There was opposition 
to the use of the scale in certain fields, this coming chiefly 
from alienists who had doubtless felt themselves antagonized 
and discounted by the criticisms that Binet had made of 
their own methods and by the evidence of the inefficiency 
of these methods, as applied to feeble-mindedness, that Binet 
and Simon had shown by the use of their tests. One alien- 
ist, by the arbitrary judgment method characteristic of a 
good part of their opposition, had declared the intelligence 
scale worthless. On the other hand, wherever the scientific 
method of criticism or evaluation was undertaken, — that is, 
wherever the scale was put to actual use in the solution of 
practical problems, whether in the field of education proper or 
in the dealings with feeble-minded individuals, — the scale 
was at once recognized as an unusually helpful instrument. 
It was of course to be expected that many weaknesses in the 
scale would develop and that suggestions for improvement 
would come from different workers. To such criticisms 
Binet seems to have had an open mind, so that he could 
profit by them and improve the efficiency of the scale. 
Results in Belgium and an analysis of them. In 1910 
Decroly and Degand (95) tested with the scale forty-three 
boys and girls in a private school in Brussels, directed by 
them, and published their results in detail. These inves- 
tigators regret the omission in the new scale of some tests 
215 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  216 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
in the 1905 series which they regard as valuable, and they 
find that tests unduly influenced by school and home training 
have not been sufficiently eliminated. They hold also that 
certain of the tests, such as those calling for the names of 
the days of the week and the months of the year, are too 
mechanical. Furthermore, the tests were in general found 
to be too easy at the lower end and too hard at the upper 
end of the scale, thus failing to make sufficient differences 
between extreme abilities. In addition to this general de- 
fect in standardization, certain tests were somewhat mis- 
placed. These critics also suggest the need of norms in the 
digits test for the years between the 7th and the 12th, though 
it is obvious that the performance differences through this 
range of years would be too small to make the suggestion 
practicable. 
Binet seems to have been somewhat confused as to whether 
their data actually confirmed or disagreed with his own 
results, and to have supposed that a mere superficial examina- 
tion of these results obtained in Belgium would lead to their 
being interpreted as unfavorable to the scale. He therefore 
got these investigators to let him have their own notes and 
unpublished tables for the purpose of making an analysis 
of them himself (45, pages 187 ff.). The data indicated that 
the Belgian children were of a superior class as compared with 
those tested in Paris. On the average they were one and 
one-half years in advance of the norms published by Binet, 
eleven of them being advanced mentally over two years. 
To what is this considerable difference due? Binet sug- 
gests three probable causes : (1) He finds evidence to believe 
that these authors have tested with an excessive indulgence, 
that without being conscious of it they have aided their sub- 
jects. He regrets that they had not come to Paris to see his 
own use of the scale; for, he says, “they knew our technique 
only through our publication” (page 189). This in itself is an 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 217 
admission of the presence of subjective elements in the scale, 
due to a lack of sufficient standardization in the administra- 
tion and scoring of the tests. The difference due to this 
factor, however, he holds to be small and too insignificant 
to account for the differences between their results and his 
own. (2) There is ample evidence that the Belgian subjects 
were from a higher social class than the subjects tested by 
Binet in Paris, the former being children of the professional 
class — doctors, professors of the University, lawyers, etc. 
(3) The Belgian children had not only had superior edu- 
cational and social opportunities in their homes but they 
were trained in small classes in school, eight to ten in a class; 
whereas the Paris children were taught in classes of around 
sixty individuals, so that for the Belgians contact with their 
instructors was more intimate, and personal acquaintance 
and stimulation was close. 
Intelligence and social class. In view of these conditions 
of differences in the homes and the schools it became evident 
to Binet that the Belgian investigators had opened up a very 
important problem, that of relative effects of heredity and 
environment on the intellectual status of children of the poor, 
on the one hand, and of the rich and the professional classes, 
on the other, as measured by the scale. 
In view of the different training of children in these two 
classes, Binet attempted to compare the results on the Paris 
children with those on the Belgian children in such a manner 
as to determine the probable effect of diverse early training ; 
so he asked himself the question, What are the tests on which 
the Belgian subjects were most in advance of those tested in 
Paris, and what are the tests showing the least difference ? 
He found the greatest superiority in the description and 
interpretation of pictures, the counting of thirteen sous, 
repeating five digits, naming four colors, comparing objects 
by memory, pointing out what is lacking in unfinished  
-P-A-G-E-232
218 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
pictures, arranging weights, naming the days of the week, 
defining abstract terms, knowing pieces of money, giving 
names of months, giving sixty words in three minutes, 
criticizing absurd sentences, and repeating sentences. An 
examination of these tests and of those in which the least 
difference was shown led Binet to conclude that the Belgian 
children excelled most in cases in which better language and 
home training counted most, and least in the matters involved 
in regular school training — copying a sentence, reading, 
counting nine sous, counting backward, writing under 
dictation, copying a diamond, giving change from twenty 
sous, making a sentence to contain three words, making 
rimes, and explaining problem questions. This interpreta- 
tion he offers tentatively, and, indeed, on rather slim evi- 
dence, his idea being that the children of the professional 
classes have superior opportunities of personal contact, and 
so express themselves with greater ease. He believed, how- 
ever, and recent studies support this view, that better native 
ability was also a factor. 
To verify these views he went back to some of his earlier 
test records of children of well-to-do parents and compared 
them with records of children of the poor class. Here he 
found little evidence of superiority of the former group. 
M. Morlé tested fifty children of a school in Paris, of which 
he was in charge, and turned his data over to Binet, having 
classified the children in four classes according to social 
conditions described respectively as misery, poverty, medi- 
ocrity, and ease. Very little evidence of correlation between 
scores in the tests and social class was found. But these 
children were all in the same school with its very large classes ; 
and Binet says that the parents “in ease”’ in this case were 
mostly merchants or “alcoholics,” whose children were 
neglected, being left to themselves without supervision and 
seldom seeing their parents. These parents were away
-P-A-G-E-233
  Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 219 
while the children were awake, and they “came home late 
and did not occupy themselves with their children” (page 194). 
| Very different results were obtained, however, from tests 
of eighteen children by Mme. Thévenot in a special school 
under her charge, in a commercial part of Paris. Her 
classes were small, consisting of about fifteen students each ; 
so the children compared favorably with those in Mlle. 
Degand’s school. They were a select group, as were the 
Belgian children. Here again the children tested on the 
average 1.7 years mentally in advance of their ages. 
In further study of this problem, Binet and M. Morlé tested 
thirty primary school children of one of the poorest parts 
of Paris and an equal number from a primary school in a 
section where the parents belonged to the class living “in 
ease.”’ Of these children sixteen in the better group were 
mentally in advance of their age to the extent of one or more 
years, and only four of the poorer group were in advance, 
while the numbers found to be mentally retarded one or more 
years in the same groups were four and twelve, respectively. 
Uses and results of the scale in England. Miss Katherine 
Johnston, of the University of Sheffield, England, visited 
Binet’s laboratory in 1910 and became acquainted with his 
method. On her return home she tested two hundred 
children in Sheffield schools (143, 144). The children were of 
very unequal status, and those of the better parentage were 
in classes of fifteen to twenty, whereas those of poorer social 
standing were in classes numbering forty to sixty. In her 
report before a section of the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science she had lost these differences in 
averages. Binet (45, page 196) urged her to compute new 
averages, making separate groups of the children of different 
classes. 
A widely recognized defect in the scale. Her results, which 
were sent to Binet for analysis, showed that in the ages
-P-A-G-E-234
    
220 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
below 10 years too large a per cent of the children were rated 
by the scale as superior mentally, whereas in the higher ages 
a majority of the children received mental ages below normal, 
indicating that the tests in the lower age-levels as standard- 
ized by Binet and Simon were too easy and that those in the 
higher levels were too hard. Early reports of tests by God- 
dard (121) and by Terman and Childs (209) in America, by 
Mlle. Descceudres (100) in Geneva, and by Bobertag (70) 
in Germany, all published too late, however, to influence 
Binet in his 1911 revision, agreed essentially in this regard 
with the work of Miss Johnston and with what Binet had 
already found out himself. 
In this agreement among investigators of different coun- 
tries, working under different circumstances, Stern (202, 
page 49) saw one of the strongest evidences of the validity 
of the tests. To quote: ‘“‘That, despite the differences in 
race and language, despite the divergences in school organ- 
ization and in methods of instruction, there should be so 
decided agreement in the reactions of the children — is, 
in my opinion, the best vindication of the principle of the 
tests that one could imagine, because this agreement demon- 
strates that the tests do actually reach and discover the general 
developmental conditions of intelligence (so far as these are 
operative in public school children of the present cultural 
epoch), and not mere fragments of knowledge and attain- 
ments acquired by chance. And this confirmation of the 
principle may also lead us confidently to expect that the dis- 
crepancies that have been revealed at the same time in some 
of the details of the system can be obviated in the future.” 
Binet gets valuable data for revision of the scale. Miss 
Johnston also arranged for Binet the tests of each year-level 
in the order of their difficulty. These data were useful to 
him, because her groups of different ages were large enough 
to be of some significance, — 41, 22, 30, 38, and 24, for ages
-P-A-G-E-235
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 221 
7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 years, respectively. In the 7-year group 
the hardest tests were the incomplete pictures, the naming of 
four pieces of money, and the repetition of five digits; in 
the eighth year, counting out change and giving two items 
remembered from a reading made by the subject; in the 
ninth, giving definitions superior to use and arranging 
weights; in the tenth, comprehension of difficult questions, 
making two sentences to include three given words, and 
knowing nine pieces of money; and in the twelfth year, 
defining abstract terms. In each year these harder tests are 
named in decreasing order of difficulty. This investigation 
was undoubtedly of much use to Binet in making the 1911 
revision of his scale. He analyzed the data and discussed 
them carefully in the Année in connection with the pres- 
entation of this revision. 
Miss Johnston’s tests were the first use made of the Binet- 
Simon scale in England, and they were followed closely by 
others carried out on defectives by Shrubsall (190), whose 
work has probably not received the recognition that it merits. 
In 1911 Abelson (1) published an article on some experi- 
ments which he had carried out to determine the reliability 
and the diagnostic efficiency of certain practical tests, and 
also to solve certain problems relating to the nature of mental 
defect. He used certain of the Binet tests and some tests 
based on geometrical figures probably suggested by the De 
Sanctis tests. The geometrical figures were overlapping 
circles, triangles, and squares, and the subjects were to indi- 
cate places that were within the circle and triangle and outside 
the square, for instance, to show that he grasped space rela- 
tions as involved here. This test has been utilized and made 
well known by Otis in his group tests, and has also been used 
in the Army Alpha. In addition to these tests Abelson 
Iso used a number of simple quickness-of-reaction and 
ensory-discrimination tests. Borderline or slightly defective 
      
    
    
     
        
  
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
subjects were used as most useful for the purposes of this 
study. Results showed that any one of the tests had about 
as high diagnostic effectiveness as any other. “For in- 
stance, the simple test of ‘tapping’ showed itself to have (for 
these defective children) just about as much diagnostic 
value as the far more plausible test of ‘interpreting pictures’ ” 
(page 310). The need of a variety of reliable tests, or tests 
that would yield consistent results, is emphasized in the con- 
clusions, and it is asserted that “tests practically valueless in 
isolation become remarkably trustworthy in pools of from 
ten to twelve.” Yet we are informed that “The reason for 
applying a large number of tests is not to gauge a number 
of different factors in ability but merely to obtain multiple 
evidence as to the one factor, the general level” (page 311). 
This study therefore found no support to the faculty view 
of mind, which would test memory, observation, judgment, 
reasoning, etc., and little importance was also attached to the 
use of “a scale of tests graduated [as are the Binet tests] to 
the ages of the persons tested.”! The essential nature of 
intellectual deficiency “seems to be a general lowering of 
that class of performances which is characterized by the need 
of clear consciousness” (ibid.). The author shows clear 
leanings toward the Spearman theory of intelligence as a 
general factor.? 
Uses of the scale in Italy. In 1908 Ferrari (113) translated 
the Binet-Simon scale of that year into Italian, but he held 
that his own tests for defectives gave a more helpful picture 
of the subject than did the Binet mental age. To this criti- 
cism and to others by Baroncini and Sarteschi, Binet replied 
in 1910 (44). Treves and Saffiotti began in 1909 a very 
.1 Myers (168) sounded an early warning against deducing conclusions 
from a “hodge-podge of statistics” and declared the scale faulty because it 
lacks the element of introspection. With this position Abelson found him- 
self in accord. 
2 See page 270.
-P-A-G-E-237
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 223 
extended investigation with the scale, one that later led to 
a radical modification of it (184). They translated the scale 
in 1910-1911 (222) and made some preliminary criticisms. 
At Binet’s request they wrote an article for the Année (183), 
which, however, had to be completed by Saffiotti alone, for 
during its preparation Treves, as well as Binet, died. These 
two Italian investigators found in the lower grades a notice- 
able superiority of the scores of children from the higher 
social classes; but in the higher grades, where a selective 
process by higher schools had left only the duller children 
of the better parentage, this superiority disappeared, and 
was indeed partly reversed in favor of the poorer children. 
Uses of the scale in Germany — Origin of intelligence quotient. 
In Germany the intelligence scale had to meet in competition 
other methods of testing which had become rather extensively 
developed. Binet himself seems never to have learned the 
German language (75, page 252), and had followed psycho- 
logical progress in Germany through the reviews regularly 
made by Henri in the Année. Stern, one of the best-known 
psychologists in the field of tests, had in 1900 published his 
well-known book (200) on individual differences, a book 
that was completely revised in 1911 under the title Dif- 
ferential Psychology (201). Meumann published an extensive 
review of the test literature in 1905 (163), which of course 
could not at that date include the Binet tests. Bobertag 
early appreciated the value of the new method in the Binet 
scale, and in 1909 published (69) a summary of Binet’s 
contributions to this subject up to that time. A couple of 
years later he published a version of the 1908 intelligence 
scale (70) that became a standard work in Germany. He 
made a number of changes and improvements in the tests, 
which, however, appeared in print too late to affect Binet’s 
last scale. Bobertag, Kramer (149), and Chotzen (92) 
early pointed out the fact that absolute retardation as 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    224 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
measured by Binet in terms of mental age increases with age 
so that a given amount of retardation is less serious in the 
case of an old than of a very young child. This demonstra- 
tion of a relation between age and degree of retardation led 
Stern in 1912 (202, pages 79 f.; 203, page 143) to suggest the 
intelligence quotient, later adopted by Terman in the Stanford 
revision of the Binet scale, a measure that is found by divid- 
ing a subject’s mental age by his actual or chronological 
age.! 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS IN AMERICA 
In America, as we have seen, there had been a vigorous 
movement in mental testing over a decade before the Binet 
scale was introduced, and a good deal of refinement in 
methods had developed in connection with the use of correla- 
tion methods worked out in England by Galton, Pearson, 
Yule, Spearman, and others. The tests were various meas- 
urements more or less independent of one another, not form- 
ing a scale in the Binet sense of this term. Valuable studies, 
in addition to those mentioned on foregoing pages, had been 
made by Bagley (7) and Seashore (185) on tests of school 
children, by Cattell (89) on the measurement of individual 
differences, in merit, by Thorndike on statistical methods in 
testing (213) and on the application of various mental tests 
to the measurement of resemblances and differences in twins, 
a study in heredity (214), by Norsworthy (169) on tests of 
1It is interesting to note that in Russia the alienist Rossolimo (182) 
attempted so to combine a series of tests as to give a profile picture of an 
individual. The profile is constructed by erecting an ordinate for each test 
score, the height of each ordinate being determined by the test score in the 
mental function it is supposed to represent. Stern says that “‘on the whole, 
the principle of the construction of the profile is too superficial and the co- 
ordination of certain tests to certain mental functions — e.g., to volitional 
acts — is not precise enough to allow us to hope for much success” (202, 
page 26). Other articles have since been published by Rossolimo, and the 
profile tests of Downey (106) in America have become well known, though 
their diagnostic value for the traits they propose to measure is still in 
question.

mentally deficient children, and by Bonser (72) on reasoning 
in school children. These investigations were, however, 
little related to the education of children in the elementary 
schools, and to the care and treatment of feeble-minded 
children. 
There was another line of development in America, which 
was very similar to the one that had served as the immediate 
stimulus in Paris to the construction of the Binet scale. The 
formal educational process was not successful with all the 
children. Retardation in the schools was drawing serious 
attention, as expressed a little later in Ayres’ well-known 
book, Laggards in Our Schools, published in 1910. More- 
over, institutions had been formed in a number of places, 
such as at Vineland, New Jersey, at Faribault, Minnesota, 
and at Lincoln, Illinois, for positively feeble-minded children, 
and these schools had developed problems of their own rela- 
tive to means of classification of the inmates and to the 
determination of their several capabilities as to training. 
hese schools for feeble-minded children furnished the 
ichest soil at first for the transplanting of the Binet tests to 
merica. Later the testing movement reached the public 
chools. 
The interest in child psychology which G. Stanley Hall had 
‘ostered at Clark University seems to have been rather closely 
elated to the practical use of the Binet scale in America; 
or it is significant that in the early part of this century, 
hen the majority of our universities were teaching and 
aking investigations in the academic psychology only, 
lark was training men like Goddard, Huey, Terman, and 
uhlmann, who later became leaders in the development of 
he Binet tests in this country.!

226 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
While the early Binet scale was known to experimental 
psychologists in America and was reviewed in the Psycho- 
logical Bulletin in 1906, it was doubtless regarded by most 
readers as being of only passing interest. The Sharp- 
Titchener study, it will be recalled, had found the tests for 
which Binet had argued in the nineties to be of very limited 
value to psychology, their value having been compared to 
that of tests of color blindness. Goddard, who went to the 
Vineland Training School in 1906 to conduct researches on 
the feeble-minded inmates of this school, received little aid 
on his new problems from the psychologists to whom he 
appealed for advice; so he turned to the literature of experi- 
mental researches and worked out some twenty-five tests, 
or “stunts,” to be used in the diagnosis of mental defective- 
ness. Some of these tests were standardized, among them 
being the well-known Seguin form board. 
The introduction of the Binet intelligence scale. At this time 
Goddard did not know of Binet’s early work on the in- 
telligence scale, but was told of it by Decroly, whom he saw} 
while on a trip abroad in 1908. Decroly gave Goddard a| 
copy of the 1905 scale, which the latter used to a limited| 
extent on his return to Vineland. “He did not think it 
contributed much over:and above what he obtained by th 
use of his own series of separate tests. In 1909, the Anné 
Psychologique for 1908, containing the 1908 revision, reache 
him. He writes of this: ‘When I read Binet’s Measurin, 
Scale, I rejected it as too formal and exact. I though 
“mind” could not be measured in that way. A secon 
thought showed me that my impression or feeling was of n 
value compared to the serious declaration of a man lik 
Binet. I accordingly set about trying out the scale on ou 
uously opposed my taking up a mental test problem at Clark University. 
have always felt that his advice was honestly and sincerely given. He wa: 
constitutionally incapable of appreciating the type of work mental teste 
attempted to do. I received so much inspiration from Hall that I hav 
never held his stand on this matter against him.”
-P-A-G-E-241
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 227 
children. The more I used it the more amazed I was at its 
accuracy’ ” (242, page 35). 
In 1908, as we have already noted, Goddard published a 
translation of the first Binet scale, and two years later one 
of the 1908 scale (119). Whipple included in the first edi- 
tion of his Manual of Mental and Physical Tests, in 1910, a 
translation and criticisms of both these scales. In the same 
year Huey (135) published in the new Journal of Educational 
Psychology a translation of the 1908 scale, and also a paper 
(134) suggesting the application of the scale to dull children 
in the schools, with a view to finding the extent of their mental 
retardation. In 1909 a special committee of the National 
Education Association reported (78) on books and tests to 
be used in the study of exceptional and mentally deficient 
children. The report contained both the Goddard revision 
of the 1908 scale and the De Sanctis tests. Even though 
Terman, who was to become the most influential authority 
in America on the application of the Binet scale to children 
in the schools, had published results of a study of genius and 
stupidity (206) in 1906, he did not become acquainted with 
the Binet scale until the following year, and “did not turn 
his attention to the tests until he went to Stanford University 
in 1910” (242, page 37). 
Kuhlmann (151) in 1911 published a condensed and 
slightly modified English version of the 1908 scale. In this 
article he gave more fully than had been done in other 
American translations of the scale, the various comments of 
the authors, Binet and Simon, and thus hoped evidently to 
contribute toward a more nearly uniform administration of 
the tests and scoring of results, as well as to enable persons 
who were “not necessarily trained in psychology” to use 
the tests. Wallin published a similar version (226) in 1911. 
The early developments in the use of the scale in America 
were reviewed and commented upon by Binet in the Année
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
in 1911, but most of the reports appeared in print too late 
to have any effect on his revision of this year. He noted, 
with possibly a little amusement, the fact that in the Whipple 
translation some of his tests were regarded as too cruel for 
the children. After mentioning the necessary changes in 
the tests to adapt them to English-speaking children, such 
as those in tests dealing with money, Binet adds: “But the 
curious thing is that the author has considered it useful to 
substitute for our sentences to be criticized, some new ones, 
under the pretext that ours are too cruel. We do, indeed, 
speak of a woman cut into pieces, of a train wreck resulting 
in forty-eight deaths, and of a man who commits suicide; 
it appears that these stories seem frightening to young 
Americans. Our young Parisians laughed at them. How- 
ever that may be, we think Whipple’s new sentences cannot 
be accepted before being tried experimentally. There is 
nothing to prove that they present a difficulty of comprehen- 
sion equal to that in ours” (45, note, page 145). Goddard’s 
use of the scale on large numbers of feeble-minded children 
(120) is also noted by Binet in this article. One of the early 
results (121) of the tests of American children was evidence, 
in agreement with the results by Miss Johnston in England, 
that the tests for the earlier years of the 1908 scale were too 
easy while those for the higher age levels were much too 
hard; that is, that the scale tended to bring too near together 
the children of the range of ages from 3 to 13 years. The 
full effect of the American tests did not reach Binet to 
influence him much if any in his final revision, but may 
nevertheless be briefly indicated here in connection -with a 
few other facts and views, to show the reader how the testing 
movement was taking hold of this country before the death 
of Binet in October, 1911. 
Criticisms and evaluations of the scale. In general it may 
be said that wherever the scale was put to practical use in 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 229 
connection with the classification of defectives it was received 
with enthusiasm as a very useful instrument, even though 
imperfections in minor details were noted. Ayres (5), how- 
ever, in 1911 published a criticism of the 1908 scale which 
seems to have been based on a priori considerations rather 
than on experimental work, and which was not well received 
by those who had used the tests most. While he expressed 
appreciation of the idea of arranging the tests into a scale of 
increasing difficulty and of giving the score in terms of mental 
age, he adversely criticized the tests adopted by Binet, as 
depending too much on the child’s ability to use words 
fluently, on the child’s recent environmental experiences, on 
his ability to read and write, to repeat words and numbers, 
to solve puzzle tests, and to define abstract terms. Some of 
these criticisms were not ill founded, but when Ayres objects 
to some of the tests as being unusual to everyday life, par- 
ticularly to the counting-backward test as being ‘“‘education- 
ally vicious,” he has clearly confounded the testing with the 
training of a child. 
Kuhlmann (152), in a vigorous defense of the scale, points 
out that certain of Ayres’ specific criticisms are founded on 
misconceptions and are not based on extensive use of the 
tests, which, we are told, contradicts these criticisms. Miss 
Lawrence (154), trying the definitions test on 748 pupils in 
the St. Cloud, Minnesota, elementary schools, finds that 
this particular test taken alone is but “a coarse sieve,” with 
some significance. 
Binet insisted on a variety of tests. This result does not, of 
course, contradict Binet’s view of the test, for at about this 
same time he was himself writing this statement: ‘One 
test has no significance, we repeat with emphasis, but five or 
six tests do mean something.” And on the same page, at 
the close of the article on the 1911 scale, he says in almost 
his last words on these tests, that the principle of using a
-P-A-G-E-244
gl aia oa a ie: 
230 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
multiplicity of tests must be a good one, for even in the case 
of Dr. Ferrari’s method of measuring intelligence, which a 
review by Mlle. Diroud had shown to contain only a small 
proportion of good tests, satisfactory results were obtained. 
“The attention of psychologists must, then, be called to this 
principle of the multiplicity of tests. Without any doubt 
these methods will be drawn upon to a large extent in the 
future in the study of aptitudes, of character, and even of the 
physiological state — in brief, for the realization of measure- 
ment in individual psychology” (45, page 201). 
Terman’s early impressions of the Binet scale. As early as 
1911 Terman published an article in which he gave his 
impressions of the 1908 scale as gained on its application to 
four hundred non-selected children, thus making a notable 
start toward using the scale for the testing of normal children. 
He reported that the Binet type of intelligence scale is fea- 
sible and of great practical and theoretical value. In this 
article he draws an interesting comparison between work 
with this scale and with the tests used in his earlier study on 
genius and stupidity, saying that he had spent nearly two 
years before in the use of various “tests of intelligence” and 
that he “could hardly count value received. My present 
belief is that the field is one that will richly repay any careful 
and well-directed effort” (207, page 199). The need of a 
radical revision of the scale was, however, indicated, for it was 
found that young children are rated too high while those 
in the upper age levels of the scale are rated too low; that is, 
that the scale was far too easy at the lower end and too hard 
at the upper end. These findings agreed with those of Miss 
Johnston in England. 
Terman mentions in this valuable article several tests of 
his own that he has tried as supplementary to the scale — a 
generalization test (the interpretation of fables), a graded 
completion test (from Ebbinghaus’ method), a vocabulary
-P-A-G-E-245
  Evalutaions of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 231 
test, and a test of practical judgment (the ball-and-field 
problem) — and he also suggests that there should be tests 
for higher levels than those at the upper end of the Binet 
scale. He urges the importance of intelligence tests, and the 
need of more attention tothem. “Everything else is relative 
to intelligence” (page 203). Teachers’ estimates are sub- 
jective and unreliable, while tests are objective. He shows 
clearly a realization of the fact that with test results at hand, 
even though the tests are not perfect, there is something 
concrete with which to work, so that in comparisons of test 
scores with other available data on the child’s ability and 
training, we are bound to get down to a factual basis and to 
consider the influence of this and that factor on the subject’s 
responses. 
Thus Terman sees so clearly the possibilities of the use of 
a good intelligence scale that the present imperfections in the 
one under consideration are but minor matters, and he 
characteristically sets himself at once to the work of revision. 
Several problems loom up in the solution of which the scale 
will be of great service. He mentions the effects on mentality 
of adenoids and of other defects, the relation of mental to 
physical age, of mental growth to pedagogical progress, of 
incorrigibility to retardation in intelligence, heredity factors 
in intelligence, and the effects on intelligence scores of pro- 
longed and unfavorable social conditions. A number of 
these problems had earlier been raised by Binet. In spite 
of the many imperfections and inadequacies of this scale, 
Terman says: “TI believe that by its use it is possible for the 
psychologist to submit, after a forty-minute diagnostication, 
amore reliable and more enlightening estimate of the child’s 
intelligence than most teachers can offer after a year of daily 
contact in the schoolroom” (page 204). 
Thus the stage was set in America for a real testing move- 
ment, and while the separate tests for different functions and
-P-A-G-E-246
232 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
the more accurate and analytical correlation methods, already 
in use in America, were proving themselves of value in various 
useful investigations, the Binet tests were found to be 
superior in the practical fields of education to any existing 
methods of intelligence testing, both on feeble-minded and 
on normal children. 
The danger of ignorant and unskilled use of the scale. Natu- 
rally there was great temptation for persons to rush into this 
testing work with very little preparation in the way of 
psychological training, and with meager notions of the ideas 
of the originator of the scale. Against the tendency thus 
threatening to injure the testing movement Clara Harrison 
Town sounded a timely warning (220). After quoting some 
of Binet’s cautions, she says: “‘ Unfortunately the American 
public has not read these paragraphs, and the result which is 
threatening is a wholesale use of the scale in an unscientific 
manner, which will do nothing but postpone the time of its 
real usefulness”’ (page 240). She answers some of Ayres’ 
objections to the scale by quoting from Binet’s 1908 article, 
which Ayres had apparently not read, and points out that 
several of the defects mentioned have been recognized by 
Binet himself and have been corrected in a new (1911) 
revision, which, she points out, has appeared, and of which 
later she became the translator (64).1 
The revised scale as put forth by Binet in the Année 
article follows. We have indicated in connection with each 
test, on the right side of the page, its origin and position in 
earlier scales. It may be well here to say that in giving these 
tests to any child, one must follow strictly the procedure under 
which they were administered in securing the data for their

de la Société libre pour Etude psychologique de Enfant, under the title 
(translated) ‘“‘A Method of Measuring the Development of the Intelligence

the Année under the title, “New Researches on the Method of Measuring 
the Intellectual Level of School Children.”

standardization. For these details the reader must go to the 
various manuals now available, or to the Town translation 
(64). A recent statement by Woodworth (238) expresses 
so well the cautions against a misuse of the scale that it is 
worth quoting here: “The Binet scale, it must be under- 
stood, is an instrument of precision, not to be handled except 
by one who has been thoroughly trained in its use. It looks 
so simple that any student is apt to say, ‘Why, I could give 
those tests!’ The point is that he couldn’t — not until he 
knew the tests practically by heart, not till he had standard- 
ized his manner of conducting them to agree perfectly with 
the prescribed manner and till he knew how to score the 
varying answers given by different children according to the 
scoring system that goes with the tests, and not till, by 
experience in handling children in the tests, he was able to 
secure the child’s confidence and get him to do his best, 
without, however, giving the child any assistance beyond 
what is prescribed. Many superior persons have looked 
down on the psychological examiner with his (or her) assort- 
ment of little tests, and have said, ‘Certainly no special 
training is necessary to give these tests. You simply want 
to find out whether the child can do these stunts. I can find 
out as well as you.’ They miss the point altogether. The 
question is not whether the child can do these stunts (with an 
undefined amount of assistance), but whether he does them 
under carefully prescribed conditions. The child is given 
two, three or four dozen chances to see how many of them 
he will accept; and the whole scale has been standardized 
by try-out on many children of each age, and so adapted 
that, when given according to instructions, it will give a 
correct measure of the child’s mental age. But when given 
by superior persons in ignorance of its true character, it 
gives results very wide of the mark. So much by way of 
caution”’ (note, pages 273 f.).

THE NEW RULES FOR SCORING 
In this scale Binet made the number of tests in each year 
five, so that each would count .2 year, though he did not 
stress the use of fractions of a year in the determination of 
mental-age. The only exception to the rule of five tests in 
a year was the 4-year level, which was left — probably by 
an oversight, as Burt says (83, page 3) — with the same four 
tests assigned to it as in 1908. The rules for scoring, slightly 
changed in this revision, are as follows: First take the 
highest year of which all the tests are passed. To this age 
add one fifth of a year for each additional test passed in any 
higher age level. Thus if a child of 8 years passes all the 
tests of the sixth year, 2 tests of the seventh year, 3 of the 
eighth, 2 of the ninth, and 1 of the tenth, he will have a 
mental age of six years plus $ of a year, which amounts to 
7.6 years. “But let it be well understood that fractions in so 
delicate an appreciation do not merit absolute confidence, 
because they would probably vary from one examination 
to another” (page 149). 
This illustration, which is actually given by Binet, is of a 
very unusual case, since the subject passes more tests in the 
eighth than in the seventh year, and since the range of year- 
levels in which part success is attained is wide. The child in 
this case would be mentally retarded .4 year if he is exactly 
8 years of age. The more, usual practice seems to have been 
to disregard fractions and simply to add one year for every 
five tests passed in levels above that in which all are passed 
(64, page 69). 
A normal child testing at age is regular in intelligence, 
according to Binet;! one getting a higher mental-age score 
than his chronological age is advanced to the extent of ba

difference, and one getting a lower mental-age score is 
retarded in intelligence to the extent of his deficiency. 
THE CHANGES MADE IN THIS REVISION 
Binet’s own experience, as well as that of certain investi- 
gators in other countries whose reports reached him before the 
final revision was made, convinced him of the need of certain 
general changes in the 1908 revision. In the first place, it 
had become evident that. the higher levels were too hard; 
so he raised four of the 11-year tests to the 12-year level, and 
all of the 12-year tests to the level for 15 years. The three 
13-year tests of the 1908 scale now, with the addition of two 
new tests, became adult tests. In the second place, certain 
tests, as Binet had recognized at least three years earlier, 
depended too much on the subject’s scholastic training or 
on knowledge incidentally gathered, which did not, as he had 
wrongly supposed, correlate much with intelligence. These 
tests, with certain others that were repetitions of tests coming 
at another level in the scale, were eliminated. Thus, repeat- 
ing a sentence of sixteen syllables and giving one’s own age, 
in the 6-year level; giving the number of fingers, copying 
“The Little Paul,” naming four common coins, in the 7-year 
level; reading a passage and remembering two items, and 
writing from dictation, in the 8-year level; and giving days 
of the week, reading a passage and remembering six items, 
in the 9-year level of the 1908 scale, — these tests are all 
omitted in the last revision. Small changes are also made, 
such as putting certain tests in a higher age level and others 
in a lower one, and adding certain tests not found in the 
previous scale. These changes we have indicated in the 
1911 scale as we have here reproduced it, so that the reader 
can readily see what they are. Some of the omitted tests 
have come back in revisions of the Binet scale by other
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
investigators, indicating that the judgment against them was 
not founded on sufficiently broad experimentation. 
THE RELIABILITY OF THE SCALE 
Binet did very little in the way of checking directly the 
reliability of the intelligence scale. It is true that high 
validity, or a high degree of correspondence between the 
ranking that a test gives individuals and their ranking by 
some good independent criterion, indicates the probability 
that the test is reliable; but more direct measures of relia- 
bility are possible and desirable. By the reliability of a test 
we mean the degree of agreement in the ranking of a group of 
individuals by it in successive applications. An order of 
merit established but once by a test may be due to chance, 
but if nearly the same order is regularly obtained in different 
applications of this test (or of different “forms”’ of it) to the 
same group, under conditions that have been reasonably 
controlled, it is evident that the test is measuring something, 
whatever it may be, rather constantly. In such a case we 
say that the test has a fair or a high degree of reliability, as 
the case may be. A simple way to test the reliability is to 
correlate the scores made by a group of individuals in the 
first test with scores made by them in a second or later test 
with the same scale. This method was not used by Binet 
with reference to his scale. 
SOME EMPIRICAL MEASURES OF RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY 
He did, however, raise the problem and he attempted by a 
more empirical method to solve it. A Belgian teacher, who 
had tested all his students with the scale, wrote Binet that 
it would be desirable to have different forms of the test so 
that the mental growth of each child could be found annually 
for a number of successive years. Binet says that it would, 
in his opinion, be easy to find substitute tests to make a new
-P-A-G-E-253
  Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 239 
form of the scale, and that this would require only patience 
and a good deal of codperation. He had thought of making 
experiments to determine whether the same tester, deter- 
mining the intellectual level of a number of children at 
intervals of fifteen days, would obtain approximately iden- 
tical results on the same individuals. “On this point I had 
but vague conjectures,” he says. ‘“‘I knew from previous 
researches on attention and adaptation that children make 
rather rapid gains in such experiments, especially when they 
are tested individually so that chances of distraction and 
ennui are avoided; I therefore supposed that if the measure- 
ment of the intellectual level were made in this way each 
student would gain more or less from one test period to 
another” (page 164). 
In 1910 M. Jeanjean carried out for Binet an experiment 
of this kind, using the 1908 scale. He tested five children 
twice, with an intervening period of fourteen days. Gains 
in the second scores over the first ones were obtained, which 
averaged an amount equal to five months. Binet admits 
this gain to be rather serious, but notes that the greatest 
gain was made on certain tests which were omitted from the 
1911 revision and that if the successive applications of the 
tests were made at intervals of a year, instead of at intervals 
of fifteen days, the effects of repetition would probably be 
considerably reduced. This bit of evidence, on five subjects, 
is of course entirely inadequate for so important a problem, 
and if Binet had lived longer he would probably have worked 
out more satisfactorily the questions of reliability and of 
transfer of training here involved. 
Results on ninety-seven children tested at age. In their 
researches on the 1908 scale Binet and Simon had studied the 
responses to the tests of children whose grade classifications 
agreed with their actual ages. Now with a view to studying 
the relationships of mental and scholastic standing, Binet
-P-A-G-E-254
  240 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
gives data in the present report on ninety-seven children who 
were tested within two months of their birthdays — that 
is, children who were practically at ages which could be 
expressed in a whole number of years — and who were un- 
selected as to mental status. The deviation of the grade of 
each child from the school grade normal to his age, and also 
that of his mental age from his actual age were found, and 
these deviations of the ninety-seven children were averaged. 
The difference in the two averages was found to be .7 year. 
There is no reason to believe that important discrepancies 
would not be covered up in such mere averages. However, 
a correlation table also constructed shows a ‘“‘remarkable 
correlation,” though not a perfect agreement, between the 
scholastic and the mental level of each child. Some of the 
children who were normal mentally were retarded simply 
because of poor educational opportunities; so a perfect 
correlation could not be expected. 
The study not only indicated a high degree of validity 
on the part of the tests, but it also justified the rule that 
Binet had proposed for a rapid sectioning of the children 
of superior intelligence in any school; i.e., to “take in every 
class the youngest, because they are the most advanced in 
their studies” (page 160). 
AMERICAN REVISIONS ARE BASED ON ALL THE 
BINET-SIMON SCALES 
It should be noted that most of the early testing in America| 
by the Binet method was based on translations of the 1908} 
scale. ‘The movement had got so well under way, and several] 
investigators had begun so early to collect data for their ow 
modifications of this scale and for the solution of other prob 
lems, before Binet’s final revision appeared in available form. 
that the latter did not readily, or indeed ever, replace th 
1908 scale. In certain respects, moreover, this earlier scal
-P-A-G-E-255
Evaluations of Binet Method and Scale of 1911 241 
was superior to the last one. Consequently those investi- 
gators who have worked out revisions of their own since 1911 
have drawn freely on all three of Binet’s scales and have 
added new tests as necessity demanded. On the whole this 
has been a fortunate procedure. 
INTELLIGENCE RATINGS IN DANGER OF BEING 
OVERSIMPLIFIED 
It must be clearly understood that while the scales de- 
veloped by Binet and his colleagues have been very useful 
in practical testing and have indeed almost revolutionized 
the procedure in the education of children in most progres- 
sive communities, they nevertheless have many weaknesses. 
Binet was as ready to admit this as any one. Intelligence 
is not a homogeneous, simple thing that can be measured as 
one measures distance with a yardstick or weight with the 
scales. Binet repeatedly urged that no one test alone can 
give an adequate measure of intelligence; that such a 
measure can be obtained only by the use of a diversity of 
tests. When we consider that any one child tested is given 
as arule the tests in from two to four year-levels, it is obvious 
that several of the individual tests may contribute to rather 
accurate total results and yet be very poor tests themselves. 
Then, too, many of these tests stress largely the same 
functions, — such as memory span, for instance, — func- 
tions that often, as in the case given, are not of very great 
importance. 
However, since memory is not independent of judgment, 
attention, comprehension, etc., and since these functions 
are not discrete and independent things as faculty psychology 
has wrongly held, all being only different forms or mani- 
festations of the adjustment of an infinitely complex organ- 
ism, it must be admitted that the Binet scale, simple as it 
lis both in conception and in construction, has not the weak- 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  242 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ness due to an unequal stress on different functions in suc- 
cessive years that such critics as Pyle (178) have supposed. 
The success of the intelligence scale has very greatly added 
to our conceptions of intelligence. Binet’s dominant idea 
of getting away from theoretical speculations on what mind 
is and of proceeding in a thoroughly empirical manner to 
study the possible responses of different individuals, has 
certainly been a most fruitful one. His general thought 
seems to have been this: formulate to yourself some practical 
working conception of mind, and then proceed experimentally 
to work on this conception, modifying it from ‘time to time 
as the facts thus obtained seem to require. He was very 
strongly opposed to introducing into psychology notions 
which could not be subjected to experimental investigation, 
speculations based on such notions being rightly regarded 
by him as obstructive to progress in psychology. It is 
probable also that experimental work with no obvious 
bearing on questions of efficiency in general behavior was 
regarded by him as of relatively little value.

CHAPTER TWELVE 
Tue Manirestations or INTELLIGENCE 
PropaBiy every person at some time or other passes 
judgment on certain of his fellows as to their degree of 
intelligence. Some men are known in their communities 
as being very capable and their opinions on problems involv- 
ing complex relationships are valued highly, while others are 
regarded as unfit for dealing with any but concrete perceptual 
situations. In the complex world of human relationships 
some persons seem to be born to lead humanity to con- 
stantly higher and higher levels of behavior, while others 
are as evitably constituted to follow the well-marked trails 
in the humdrum of daily life. 
This fact seems to be taken for granted by all thoughtful 
individuals, and to have been recognized even in ancient 
times. Any careful observer of his fellows must have come 
to the conclusion that there are marked differences in the 
general abilities, or in the intelligences, of different individ- 
uals; and he must also have a good deal of confidence in 
his ability to pick out merely from general observation of 
his acquaintances those who are superior intellectually and 
those who are inferior. Between these extremes there are 
large numbers who differ less in amount of general intel- 
ligence, though they may show differences in minor traits, 
and who therefore cannot with much certainty be thus 
differentiated. 
JUDGMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE IMPROVE WITH OPPORTUNITY 
TO TEST THEM 
It is to be conceded, too, that persons who have a great 
deal of close contact with many individuals can judge dif- 
ferences in ability, other things being equal, better than can 
243
-P-A-G-E-258
  244 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
those who have more limited contact. One might therefore 
expect that teachers especially would be able to give a rather 
accurate rating of children as to mental ability, for they have 
the advantage not only of close contact with groups of 
children of nearly equal ages but also of trying the children 
out constantly on problems about at the limit of their several 
abilities. This opportunity of checking up their own judg- 
ments of the various children in their classes by seeing from 
day to day what they can do, is a rare advantage on the part 
of the teacher; and in addition to this the teacher is, as a 
rule, specially trained to interpret and direct the behavior 
of children. ; 
Parents, too, have good opportunities to see manifestations 
of the increasing abilities of children, but their experience is 
much more limited as to the number of cases coming under 
their observation, and they are also much more biased and 
therefore ready to explain noticeable limitations in their 
offspring in terms more agreeable to themselves than to 
attribute them to lack of ability. 
This advantage of the teacher has been recognized since 
the beginning of intelligence testing, and numerous investi- 
gators, since the example set by Galton, have made use of 
teachers’ judgments as a check on the accuracy of their 
tests. Teachers’ judgments, however, are influenced by 
many subjective and irrelevant factors and have value only 
when there is considerable acquaintance with the several 
children to be rated; but it is obvious that tests whose 
results would be even as dependable as the estimates of 
teachers would be extremely valuable both in educational 
work and in the numerous problems that arise in social and 
industrial life. It is now a well-known fact that the Binet 
scale gives a more valid rating of students’ mentalities than 
can be obtained from teachers’ estimates.
-P-A-G-E-259
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 245 
BINET’S STUDY OF THE ESTIMATES OF INTELLIGENCE BY 
TEACHERS 
How do the judgments of intelligence by teachers compare 
in reliability with rankings by means of a scale such as that 
developed by Binet and Simon? This most interesting 
problem was raised by Binet and is discussed rather fully 
in his article in the 1911 volume of the Année, in which he 
presented his revised scale shortly before his untimely death. 
A colleague, reproaching him amicably, had told him that 
teachers could without difficulty judge the intelligence of 
their students. Binet, who frequently met this view, that 
the intelligence tests are superfluous, planned to test out the 
accuracy of this statement. Through the codperation of 
M. Belot, inspector of the primary schools of Paris, he sent 
the following questions to the teachers: “(1) What propor- 
tion of errors do you think you have committed in rating the 
intelligence of your students? (2) What means do you 
employ to obtain an exact rating” (45, pages 169, 170) ? 
Frequency of errors admitted by the teachers. About forty 
responses were received. The answers varied from short 
ones to some of eight or ten pages, averaging three or four 
pages, and they showed great differences of opinion. Some 
teachers thought that they made no errors at all, while others 
declared that as they came to know their pupils better it 
became more and more difficult to rate some of them. The 
errors in classification admitted by the teachers varied from 
one in a thousand to one in three cases. The average 
was one in eight, but, as Binet remarked, this figure cannot 
have much meaning in view of the divergence of opinion, a 
divergence which was of course to be expected, since there 
were no objective standards according to which the different 
estimates could be made. ‘“‘If I say,” says Binet, in discuss- 
ing this fact, “that a plank before me is 3 m. 45 cm. and then
-P-A-G-E-260
  | 
246 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
measure it immediately, my error can easily be determined ; 
but if I am content with saying that it is very long, how can 
my estimate be checked” (45, page 170)? Precision, he 
continues, is a precondition both of truth and of error. Some 
teachers will say of a child that he is “very intelligent,” 
some that he is “‘above average,” and still others may attempt 
to put him into one of three classes, of superior, median, and 
inferior intelligence. Teachers with more accurate habits 
may even attempt to rate him by a scale of several degrees 
of value, such as very dull, dull, average, bright, very bright. 
Obviously comparisons cannot easily be made unless all use 
the same scale or method. Moreover, those persons with the 
most indefinite notions are likely to be most satisfied because 
they have not attempted to check their judgments by actual 
tests. In general, the more definite one’s judgments are, 
the more noticeable becomes their correctness or incorrect- 
ness. | 
Some teachers’ conceptions of intelligence. While the sec- 
ond question did not call for a definition of intelligence, it 
implied that each teacher had a conception of what it is. 
Several replies included a definition and others clearly 
indicated the conception in the mind of the teacher replying. 
A number of these teachers confounded intelligence with 
memory, some with the mere ability to take on instruction, 
and others limited it too narrowly to the power of knowing 
and comprehending, which Binet says in his comment is only 
a part of intelligence. Some of the teachers meant by 
intelligence a power of developing new ideas, representing 
thus a reaction against the mere retention view, but again 
restricting the term too greatly. 
Binet’s comment on these definitions is interesting. To 
find the new, he says, is not the sole function of intelligence ; 
many minds that are original lack ability to balance or weigh 
the several relevant factors. The fool who has deliriums
-P-A-G-E-261
  
The Manifestations of Intelligence Q47 
wherein one finds new ideas, is certainly not a model of intel- 
ligence. “It would be better,” says Binet, “to say that 
intelligence serves to discover truth; but even that con- 
ception would be too narrow, and we revert to our favorite 
theory: intelligence manifests itself in the best possible 
adaptation of the individual to his environment” (page 172). 
One teacher reflected this view when she said that intelli- 
gence should not be regarded as merely the ability to appre- 
hend; it serves to make one’s way in life. 
Signs of intelligence. Physiognomy, the form of the head, 
heredity or ancestry, the eyes, and the expression of the face 
were all mentioned by some teachers as indicative of intel- 
ligence. The expression of the eyes, as active for intelligence 
and passive for the lack of it, was often the basis of the 
determination, one teacher regarding a mere glance of the 
eye as a sufficient indicator of the degree of intelligence. 
Physiognomy was frequently reverted to: an open, wide- 
awake, and mobile countenance or a sympathetic expression 
was associated with intelligence, while an expressionless 
face signified dullness. While there is no ground for denying 
the usefulness in many cases of these characterizations, it is 
true that serious errors are often made in judgments based 
on such factors. The reading of intelligence in the features 
is a superficial and often deceptive method. Moreover, 
the judgment of intelligence by such signs is largely a sub- 
jective procedure. How can it be brought to quantitative 
standards? 
One of the best teachers mentioned as two principal 
elements serving to reveal the intelligence of a child, his 
responses in the class and the manner in which he plays. 
It is true, comments Binet, that intelligence shows itself by 
initiative and creation, and the lack of it by imitation in such 
activities, but how can we describe accurately what we see 
in a child at play? ‘Obviously some sort of standardization
-P-A-G-E-262
  248 Early| Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
is desirable even though the validity of any of these indicators 
of intelligence is admitted. 
Most tiers however, based their estimates on the class 
work of the pupils. The teacher was in the school to instruct, 
and so, perhaps naturally, focused his attention on the in- 
struction, marking as the higher in intelligence those who 
assimilated it the better and the more easily. Anyway, 
the pupil was there to learn, and to the degree that he did 
not learn he failed to play his part, which failure would in 
most cases be attributed to a lack of intelligence, although 
numerous factors other than innate general ability may 
possibly have been influential. Teachers who held this view 
were too much inclined, unfortunately, to estimate the child 
by his success in the particular subjects which they taught, 
these seeming to them of the greatest importance. Thus his- 
tory, language, or, in particular, mathematics would become 
the chief means of judging intelligence. Speaking of older 
students, Binet says: “It is incontestable that knowledge 
does not measure intelligence. At bottom knowledge rep- 
resents only the intelligence of others; there is some merit 
in having assimilated it, a fact that reveals something of 
memory first of all, then of attention, of comprehension, of 
work, of method; but on the other hand there is many an 
intellectual quality that is not comprised in knowledge” 
(page 176). 
It is not just what one has acquired that is significant, as 
many teachers recognized in their replies, but what one 
contributes by one’s own personality. Mere advance or 
retardation in school may result from the presence or absence 
of certain special aptitudes. ‘Certain children who dislike 
the ordinary work of the class make their compensation in 
manual work — sewing, drawing, writing; little girls who are 
poor in spelling are strong in sewing and in the ability to keep 
house, and taking everything into consideration these latter  
-P-A-G-E-263
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 249 
aptitudes are the more important for their future welfare” 
(pages 176f.). Binet held that because of the diversity of 
aptitudes it cannot be maintained that students who are good 
in mathematics are necessarily intelligent, or the reverse, and 
he pointed out that literary men, politicians, and others are 
sometimes poor in mathematics even when they are obvi- 
ously endowed with a high degree of intelligence. Expressive 
reading or a good memory of facts, too, may be deceptive 
as an indicator of intelligence. 
For many teachers, it was found, the best method of deter- 
mining a child’s intelligence is to get his responses to questions 
and to make him talk. Thus some teachers would have him 
explain what he has just read, pass judgment on an event or 
institution, analyze a selection grammatically, cite a rule that 
applies to a given case, or point out various applications of a 
rule. 
Now let us examine the experimental methods reported or 
suggested by the teachers. Some of them would determine 
intelligence by means of a set of questions and problems 
resembling tests, of which they sent samples. Here are a few 
of them: Why do you love your parents? If three persons 
ean do a piece of work in seven hours, can five do it in more 
or less than seven hours? Which do you prefer, two pieces 
of five francs each or one piece of ten francs? One person 
said that to know his pupils better he annually gave them 
some simple tests, such as having them estimate a fact of 
current life, describe an object placed before them, and learn 
ten lines of text in as short a time as possible. 
Binet points out that most of the questions asked by the 
teachers called to too great an extent for mere information 
gained in a certain degree and line of instruction, as in 
geography or arithmetic, questions which would embarrass 
even a child of good ability who is ignorant because of lack of 
opportunity. However, he recognized that the resort to
-P-A-G-E-264
  250 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
experimentation and to the objective handling of results was 
a step toward the right method. It is only under the con- 
trolled conditions of experimentation that reliable results 
can be obtained. All subjects can then be placed under 
approximately identical circumstances and the responses of 
one child can be compared with responses of other children 
of the same age and of somewhat equal training. In this 
way the responses can become standardized, and definite 
norms can be set up, according to which the abilities of any 
child can be evaluated. 
An experiment on how three teachers determined intelligence. 
At Binet’s request three of the teachers came to his laboratory 
to try their methods in his presence on children with whom 
they were not acquainted. Each teacher spent an afternoon 
examining the intelligence of five children. Each had full 
liberty to examine every child according to his own methods. 
Binet found that they propounded to the children various 
interesting questions. “Thus, since in the vicinity of the 
school there was a canal and some locks, one teacher wished 
to know if the children understood what locks are, what they 
are used for, and how they work. The problem thus pre- 
sented appeared curious to me,” says Binet, “but the interro- 
gation was laborious. The teacher did not ask each child 
exactly the same questions, and she aided some children 
more than others. Moreover, the question thus presented 
was of a local character, being one that she would not 
have used in another school; she was wrong in using a | 
particular kind of question which made general comparisons — 
impossible. Another teacher had brought with him some 
pretty pictures which he had the children observe. He then 
asked them various questions about the objects which were 
represented in the pictures; for example, ‘Why is this a 
garret and not an ordinary room?’ ‘How is a garret to be 
distinguished from a room?’ The idea was excellent, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 251 
it was poorly carried out. In the first place the questions 
appeared to me to be too easy; then they varied from one 
child to another; and, finally, the examiner lost time teaching 
a lesson to those children who responded poorly” (page 184). 
When one examination was being conducted the blow of a 
hammer resounded from a near-by factory in the course of 
construction, and the examiner took advantage of the situa- 
_ tion to ask whether in a factory it was best to have the walls 
thick or thin. Some of the questions attempted to ascertain 
whether the subjects were in the habit of reading the news- 
papers or understood what they heard others read, while 
others related to names of streets and other purely particular 
and local facts, on which all children could not justly be 
compared. The examinations usually ended in questions 
about definite school subjects. 
The examiners often used questions which merely presented 
an alternative, and so were answerable in one half of the cases 
by a pure guess even though the subjects were wholly 
ignorant of the facts or relations involved. Different 
methods of scoring or evaluating responses were also noted, 
the examiners not giving equal weight to identical responses. 
Moreover, such factors in the response as hesitation, rate of 
response, and animation of the subject were not uniformly 
evaluated by the three examiners. In one case two replies 
to the same question were identical, but one child was given 
by the same examiner a higher score than the other, because 
the teacher had already concluded that he was the more 
intelligent. 
The need of standardization of tests made evident. Binet 
asked the examiners about their methods of scoring the 
responses. One replied that he took the first child as a 
standard, comparing the others with him and ranking them 
higher or lower in intelligence. Another compared all five 
subjects with a known child of the same age judged to be of
-P-A-G-E-266
  252 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
about average intelligence. It is obvious that an answer 
cannot be scored wholly in terms of units on an absolute scale, 
and also that a child cannot be scored by the same standard 
as an adult. The method of comparing all subjects with 
some known child, however, requires for its proper use a wide 
acquaintance with children on the part of the tester and a 
similar experience for all the testers. Only under these 
conditions could their norms be the same. Binet noted a_ 
serious defect, in addition to that of the limitations of and 
differences in the experiences of the testers; this defect is 
that the known child thought of as a norm was not subjected 
to the tests himself. It is obvious that nothing but a stand- 
ardized scale can quite supply the needs of objective meas- 
urement, giving each tester like every other one a scale of 
equal relative units. 
The experiments of Binet with these three teachers thus 
made it very clear that, put into a practical situation with 
unknown subjects, one is forced to resort more or less directly 
to the methods of the objective test; that is to say, one is 
forced, first, to get the reactions of each child to a set of 
definite questions or problems, and, second, to evaluate the 
responses according to a set of norms. The more thoroughly 
these questions have been freed from local circumstances, 
from dependence as to content upon certain courses of 
instruction, from a form involving answers of the yes and no 
type, etc., and the more they are made to stress judgment 
and other higher mental processes, the better they are; and 
the more carefully the norms have been derived from a 
standardization based on numerous responses of large num- 
bers of representative children of the different ages, the' 
less subjective and erroneous will be the evaluation of the 
reactions of any child to the tests. 
Binet asked an alienist, who was a bitter critic of his 
method, how he would determine a child’s degree of intelli-
-P-A-G-E-267
  
The Manifestations of Intelligence 253 
gence. He replied that he preferred simply to show the child 
some postal cards and to cause him to talk about them. 
This, Binet points out, is nothing but the test method poorly 
used, and he adds this characteristic comment: ‘Our critic 
of tests, then, also employs tests, but, let us say to do him 
justice, he employs them badly” (page 186). 
THE USE OF TEACHERS’ JUDGMENT OF INTELLIGENCE IN 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF TESTS 
Despite the various shortcomings of teachers’ judgments 
of the intelligence of their students, these judgments were 
almost indispensable to the pioneer makers of intelligence 
scales; for in the construction of the tests it was necessary 
to find out how the responses of children known to be bright 
and capable differed from those of dull children. Tests that 
made the most clear differences between these two classes 
of children were selected as most serviceable in intelligence 
scales, or as the best tests. 
Binet had tried out various individual tests for a period of 
nearly fifteen years before he and Simon made the now well- 
known scale. Besides evaluating the several tests by their 
effects on children of different degrees of intelligence, as 
explained, these investigators also sought to determine their 
worth by giving them to groups of children of different ages, 
assuming that on the whole the older the children, up to a 
certain limit, the greater their abilities. It was doubtless 
this use of different age groups to measure the validity of 
tests that finally led Binet to the idea of mental-age units in 
an intelligence scale, an idea that proved so useful and simple 
as greatly to increase the value of the test scale. In stand- 
ardizing the scale Binet and Simon selected children who 
were very near to the exact age for which norms were sought 
and who were also in the right grades for their ages, but 
they admit that taking all children of each age irrespective
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
of their school classifications would give better norms. This 
latter method has become in post-Binet testing the one more 
commonly used. 
THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN IN ANY GRADE USUALLY THE 
MOST INTELLIGENT 
With the intelligence scale completed for practical use, 
Binet found ample evidence for the view, already prevalent 
among investigators using tests, that old dull children were 
usually overrated by their teachers as to mental ability 
because of being compared with younger children with whom 
they were classed, the teachers not taking note to a sufficient 
degree of accuracy of the age differences. Applying himself 
to this problem of agreement between intellectual level as 
determined by the tests and scholastic standing, Binet found 
that there was a general agreement between the rankings 
of children by the tests and their respective degrees of suc- 
cess in school. The very intelligent were never found to be 
retarded in school if opportunities had been normal, and those 
of very low rating by the scale were never advanced scholas- 
tically ; there were, however, dull children who were classed 
according to age in the schools, this probably being due to the 
tendency in lower grades to promote on the basis of age. A 
tendency was noted also for bright children to be somewhat 
behind the school grade normal to their mental age, or normal 
to children whose mental level they equaled. This was 
partly due to a failure of the teachers to recognize their 
mental superiority and to advance them according to their 
abilities, and also partly to the lack of opportunity on the 
part of certain of the children. 
It was found in any grade that the oldest children were as a 
rule retarded mentally, that their mental-age levels deter- 
mined by the test were below their real ages. On the other 
hand, the youngest children in any grade were found to be
-P-A-G-E-269
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 255 
mentally advanced, to receive intelligence levels higher than 
those normal to their chronological ages (pages 159 ff.). 
When teachers were asked to compare given children in their 
classes as to intelligence, they showed a tendency to rate the 
older children higher and the younger children lower mentally 
than the scale rated them. In explanation of this fact it was 
pointed out by Binet that teachers in any given school grade 
were inclined to compare the children simply on the basis of 
their work, not taking account of ages; and that they there- 
fore would call, say, a 10-year-old child equal intellectually 
to a 13-year-old child if their work was of about equal grade, 
even though the former child had had fewer years of training. 
The scale showed its superiority in the way of giving a more 
objective rating and one based more on native ability, and 
also in comparing the performance of each child directly 
with that of normal children just his age. 
THE PSYCHOLOGIST’S ADVANTAGE IN THE CHARACTERIZATION 
OF INTELLIGENCE 
With the improved means of mental measurement thus 
afforded by the intelligence scale it was possible for the 
psychologist to give a better rating of a child’s mental 
ability than the teacher who had known the child for a year 
or more in close personal contact could give. The psycholo- 
gist can constantly check his conceptions of intelligence 
experimentally and can thereby steadily improve them. 
It is evident that the moment we get a definite scale for the 
measurement of anything, such as atmospheric pressure, 
blood pressure, per cent of cream in milk, bodily temperature, 
or what not, we begin to observe more closely the thing thus 
measured and the effect of different conditions upon its 
variations. We are then more likely to make assertions 
about the conditions which determine the changes and about 
the thing measured, and, inasmuch as these assertions are
-P-A-G-E-270
  256 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
erroneous in any way, to have them checked up more defi- 
nitely as differences of opinion arise; and so improvements 
in our conceptions come about more rapidly than they do 
when we have no accurate means of measurement. Without 
such definite means of check on our views it is not easy to 
locate differences in them, and unless the matter is of supreme 
importance the conceptions are perpetuated from genera- 
tion to generation with little change. Moreover, the lack of 
means of accurate measurement conduces to vagueness as 
well as to fixity of view. Compare, for instance, the definite- 
ness and rate of change of conceptions of the electron in 
physics with those of faith healing in popular life, of survival 
after death, or of the Trinity !! 
Now, applying this principle, that the more accurately our 
conceptions are checked, the more rapidly they tend to 
become correct, to changes in conceptions of intelligence, 
we are prepared to expect great progress in these conceptions 
during a period of the construction of intelligence tests, 
especially as far as the psychologists working on this sub- 
ject are concerned. If one supposes, as Binet seems to have 
supposed at one time, that literal memory is an important 
element of intelligence, it is only a matter of time until the 
tests, whose ratings are constantly checked with other cri- 
teria, will reveal whether or not this view is correct. This 
is not true, of course, if the giving of the tests is solely for the 
placement of the children, and not principally for purposes 
of testing the tests. Since Binet spent most of the time he 
devoted to testing, and indeed most of his adult lifetime, in 
determining the accuracy of various tests and in checking 
their results against other criteria, and since he had unusual     
           
    
                            
       1 The charge often brought against science, that its conceptions change so 
often and are therefore evidently not reliable, shows an unfortunate mis- 
understanding by the popular mind of the facts we have here pointed out. 
The untrained, mediocre mind seems to sense a profound security in vague, 
unchanging notions.
-P-A-G-E-271
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 257 
opportunities for trying out his tests on children of all 
grades of intelligence from idiocy to mental superiority, 
it will be profitable and interesting to examine his views of 
intelligence. 
BINET’S CONCEPTIONS OF INTELLIGENCE 
Binet in no place gave a full and systematic definition of 
intelligence, so we must gather his ideas from his various 
more or less partial statements from special points of view. 
In his early writings, as we have seen, he reacted against the 
views of Galton and the German psychologists, who attempted 
to measure intelligence, or the intellectual ability of the 
individual, by means of certain sensory discrimination and 
reaction tests. He urged that tests of the higher complex 
processes are more significant, and maintained that they 
cannot easily be classified as tests of attention, of memory, 
of imagery, etc., each of these processes being complex and 
present to an extent in all higher mental operations. He 
also criticized Gilbert’s attempts to find differences between 
children of different ages and adults, on the ground that the 
child has not simply less memory, less perception, less reason, 
less motor ability, etc., than the adult; the child, he held, 
has a manner of thinking, of reasoning, of willing, and of 
remembering peculiar to himself as a child; he differs quali- 
tatively from the adult. Binet certainly yielded a good deal 
in this stand when later he developed the idea of an intelli- 
gence scale in which were repeated at higher and higher 
levels, tests that were largely of the same kind. From the 
time of his first test series in 1896, however, he insisted 
ather generally that mental tests should be complex and 
should measure a variety of processes, especially the higher 
mes. A notable exception to this insistence is his attempt 
in the last part of the nineties to measure attention by two- 
oint discrimination methods.  
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Early stress on memory and imagery. Binet’s early tests 
and investigations of exceptional persons and of groups of | 
children dealt considerably with memory and imagery, which 
he seemed to regard as of special significance in the constitu- 
tion of general ability or intelligence. It is significant that 
he rejected the associationists’ account of memory as revival 
by mere association. The process of recall he held to be 
directed mainly by attention and the will, the subject being 
able voluntarily to direct his efforts to recall toward certain 
groups of experience with which he felt that the desired facts 
would be found. His interest seems at that time to have 
been more in attention, or the power thus to direct one’s 
mental operations, than in memory as the mere ability to 
retain, and with Henri in 1895 he enthusiastically described 
their memory-of-sentences method as a veritable “dynamom- 
eter of attention.” There seems to have been great hope 
in his mind at one time for suggestibility tests as indicators 
of intellectual ability, the mentally weaker children seeming 
to have less self-direction and more suggestibility than the 
more intelligent; but Simon probably dampened this hope 
somewhat when he found an absence of suggestibility in low- 
grade defectives. Dresslar had shown, moreover, that the 
more intelligent subjects were influenced by the size-weight 
illusion — suggestion of weight by size — more than were 
the duller ones. 
Attention. The article on attention and adaptation,| 
published in 1900, reported numerous tests the practical aim| 
of which was to measure the force of voluntary attention, 
The attempt to isolate and measure this “faculty” was no 
very successful, though certain tests showed difference 
between the more and the less intelligent children used a: 
subjects, and some of them showed a much quicker adapta 
tion on the part of the former group. It is clear in Binet’ 
discussion in this article that he regards attention as a ver:     
      
                     
          
    
        
    
-P-A-G-E-273
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 259 
essential characteristic of general intelligence. The defini- 
tion of attention which he gives here is indeed so broad as to 
suggest very definitely the source of Stern’s later definition 
of intelligence. “Attention,” we are told, “consists in a 
mental adaptation to a situation which is new to us.” Fur- 
ther studies of two-point discrimination, which Binet. had 
hoped would measure the degree of voluntary attention, 
failed to yield anything of value to him. It is interesting to 
note that in this view Binet came close to the idea of Galton 
and his disciples, who sought to get a measure of intelligence 
in one’s sensory discrimination capacity. Indeed, Binet 
approximates here the view of the school which he earlier 
opposed in the article on individual psychology, but he was 
unable to get any high correlations of discrimination with 
intelligence, or indeed even to get a reliable measure of a 
subject’s two-point discrimination (38, page 252). In the 
extended experiments on his two daughters, published in 
1902 in his book L’étude expérimentale de V intelligence, he 
uses the term “intelligence ”’ as the sum total of the higher 
mental processes. ; 
Judgment. Throughout his practical work on the intelli- 
gence scale, as well as in his several later writings, Binet 
plainly regards intelligence as a complexity of mental func- 
tions, though the importance of certain general functions 
such as attention, self-determination of will, and judgment is 
never overlooked; and he thus steers between the two 
extreme views of Thorndike and Spearman, later to be con- 
sidered. At the time of the construction of the first scale, 
judgment was regarded as the essential characteristic of 
intelligence, but this was for him by no means a simple 
process. In his enthusiasm over the intelligence scale he 
seems seldom to have lost sight of the diversity of intellectual 
aptitudes, which in the report on the 1908 revision he an- 
nounces (61, page 2) as one of his special objects of study. At
-P-A-G-E-274
  260 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
this late period of his life he finds the matter of intelligence 
more complex than he had ever imagined it to be. “Our 
minds always simplify nature” (ibid.). 
His extensive studies of defectives and of disorganized 
minds gave Binet an opportunity to observe the workings 
of intelligence at low levels. In 1909 he and Simon published 
a long article (62) on studies in which they attempt by differ- 
ent experiments to throw light on the various cognitive pro- 
cesses of defectives, leaving out of consideration for the time, 
as they note explicitly, any direct evaluation of the instincts 
and emotions. They consider especially the intellectual 
differences between these unfortunate individuals and normal 
persons. Studies of the thought processes have too fre- 
quently become merely investigations of mental images, 
but Binet’s studies had convinced him “that thought is 
not a passive state, but above all a state of action”; that 
thinking is not just taking note of things in one’s conscious- 
ness, but making attempts, groping one’s way, and choosing 
between alternatives (page 128). 
Direction, adaptation, and auto-criticism. Thought, in his 
view as here expressed, is composed of three distinct elements : 
a direction, an adaptation, and an auto-criticism, and the 
defective lacks in all three. We can make clear by illustra- 
tion what is meant by these “elements” or aspects of the 
thought process. First, effective, thoughtful behavior takes 
and keeps a definite direction. If you instruct a young child 
to do something, as to pick out from a heterogeneity of 
objects of different colors all those that are red, you will find 
that he easily becomes sidetracked, so to speak, by various 
distracting conditions. He does not maintain his direction 
of thought and activity as one of higher mentality would do. 
In some of our present-day group mental tests the subjects are 
shown some pictures that are incomplete in certain respects 
or that lack parts, such as the mouth of a face, an arm of a
-P-A-G-E-275
The Manifestations of Intelligence 261 
man, a wheel of a wagon, the shadow of one tree in a group 
of trees all the others of which have shadows, and so on. As 
“fore-exercises”” in what is to be done the children are 
directed to complete certain practice pictures. When it is 
clear that each child understands what he is to do, the 
children are instructed to turn a page to a number of pictures 
all of which lack certain parts. These the children, each of 
whom has a copy, are to study one by one and then supply 
whatever is lacking, keeping on until time is called. The 
exercises get harder gradually and so require more and more 
careful scrutiny for the detection of successive incomplete- 
nesses. It is found that very young children as well as 
persons of low mental development soon get “off the track” 
and occupy themselves in mere random decoration of the 
pictures, if indeed they continue working with the pencil 
at all (172, page 37). Effective work here obviously involves 
keeping in mind what is to be done and continuing to look 
critically for incomplete parts in the pictures. This illus- 
trates what Binet meant by maintaining a direction in think- 
ing, and he found that differences in ability to do this were 
significant of intelligence differences. “Thus one of the chief 
characters that distinguish a superior from an inferior intel- 
ligence is the power of direction of thought, and this ability 
manifests itself in two ways: by its complexity and by its 
persistence” (page 131). Psychology, he says, has treated 
sensations, ideas, movement, etc., too much in isolation, 
whereas he believes that “the prime fact, the most important 
of the facts of the psychic life, is a coérdination which gives 
to the current of ideas a definite direction” (pages 131 f.). 
But mere direction in thought is not enough. There must 
be adaptation of means to ends. Thinking is choosing con- 
stantly between various ideas and means, which become 
clearer and more definite in successive experiences. The 
idea is not a disinterested process without reference to the  
-P-A-G-E-276
  262 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
necessities of life. Like nutrition and respiration it is a vital 
function, and exists only because it serves some end. The 
child and the person of low ability are influenced unduly by 
immediate circumstances; they do not calculate and take 
into consideration remote consequences as do individuals of 
greater intelligence. The choice of ends, however, depends 
less on intelligence than on emotional, sentimental, and 
instinctive factors, while the means of reaching the ends 
depend on intelligence. 
Yet Binet recognized that intelligent action is, after all, 
but a more long-range trial-and-error adaptation, not an 
infallible bolt from the blue sky. “In the case of a new act, 
adaptation is not made with precision in the first attempt; 
it is effected only gradually by successive trials” (page 134). 
In simple perceptual situations that do not involve reflec- 
tion and in various discrimination and association tests the 
persons of low-grade intelligence differ but little from those 
of higher grades, but in adaptive processes involving the 
choice of means to remote ends the difference becomes more 
clearly evident. A number of tests requiring this more com- 
plex adaptation to remote ends are cited as being trouble- 
some alike to young children and to persons of low mentality. 
There is also in effective thought a critical spirit, judgment, 
an appearance of control of the situation, for which the term 
“auto-criticism” has been fortunately suggested by certain 
alienists, we are told. Besides comprehension of the objec- 
tive aspects of the situation there is a criticism, a reflection, 
that involves or turns upon and evaluates one’s own reactions 
in reference to the objective situation. The imbecile does 
not see the inadequacy of his attempts, and so he cannot 
gradually adapt himself by trying better methods. Thus in 
the disarranged-sentence test, satisfaction with an order of 
the words that conveys no adequate thought whatever is 
frequently shown by persons of low mental age.
-P-A-G-E-277
  
The Manifestations of Intelligence 263 
Comprehension and invention. In Binet’s book, Les idées 
modernes sur les enfants, published also in 1909, which sum- 
marizes in a popular way many of his researches and con- 
clusions, a full chapter of sixty-three pages is devoted to a 
consideration of “Intelligence, Its Measurement and Educa- 
tion,” and a slight change in his view is found. “Compre- 
hension, invention, direction, and criticism — intelligence is 
contained in these four words,” he says (page 118). Here 
comprehension and invention seem to have replaced adapta- 
tion, and so indicate to us more precisely Binet’s meaning of 
adaptation. It is not a mere passive fitting into immediate 
circumstances, but rather an active organization of responses 
in relation to a complexity of conditions. “In our opinion,” 
we read, “intelligence considered independently of the phe- 
nomena of sensibility, emotion, and will is above all a faculty 
of apprehension which is directed toward the external world 
and which works toward the reconstruction of it as a whole 
on the basis of the small fragments which we are given of 
it. That which we perceive is the element a, and all the 
complicated work of our intelligence consists in welding to 
this a second element, b. All knowledge is then essentially 
an addition, a continuation, a synthesis” (pages 117 f.), 
whether made automatically or deliberately; and in this 
addition to element a a number of mental functions co- 
operate, — comprehension, memory, imagination, judgment, 
and above all speech. 
Binet makes clear his view that “the mind is unitary, 
despite the multiplicity of its faculties, that it possesses one 
essential function to which all the others are subordinated” 
(page 117). This function he has elsewhere stated as adjust- 
ment to environment for the continuity of the life of the 
individual. He says that while there exist between the child 
and the adult differences in experiences, in knowledge, in 
ideas, and in vocabulary, and while the two have different
-P-A-G-E-278
  
264 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
ends, interests, preoccupations, and instincts, the main dif- 
ference from our present standpoint is one of intelligence, 
and to characterize this difference he recurs to his scheme 
consisting of direction, comprehension, invention, and criti- 
cism. Compared with the adult as to direction, the child is 
deviating and inconstant; he is seized by fantasies, by 
caprices, and by passing ideas, wandering in conversation 
from one subject to another as mere contiguous associations 
may determine. On his way to school he does not follow a 
straight course, as does the adult, but zigzags hither and 
thither, being deviated from his course by every spectacle 
that interests him and causes him to forget his purpose and 
change his path. When absorbed in any one thing, he loses 
other things from view. 
THE NORMAL CHILD’S INTELLIGENCE COMPARED TO THAT 
OF AN ADULT IMBECILE 
The ‘child’s comprehension is superficial. Though per- 
ceiving as well as the adult the form, contour, distance, and 
sounds of exterior objects, and not suffering anything in the 
acuity of his senses, which is strong, and though readily 
comparing weights, colors, and lengths with an exactness 
which astonishes us, he shows a feebleness when it comes to a 
question of discernment between the merely incidental and 
the essential, a question of comprehending abstract relations. 
He has a comprehension only of a sensorial nature, which 
dwells on the surface of things. His power of invention, we 
are told, is equally limited; he is more randomly imaginative 
than rational, sensorial than verbal, and he neither evolves 
anything nor differentiates. Binet brings out these points 
in the picture test. The young child only enumerates or 
describes, but does not interpret. 
The power of criticism is, in the child, as limited as are the 
other thought characteristics considered. ‘‘He judges poorly
-P-A-G-E-279
    
The Manifestations of Intelligence 265 
of the accuracy of what he says and does. He is just as 
awkward in mind as he is with his hands. He is remarkable 
for the ease with which mere words satisfy him and does 
not realize the limitation of his comprehension. The why’s 
with which his curiosity harasses us are hardly embarrassing, 
because he will be naively satisfied with the most absurd 
because’s. He disentangles very poorly the difference be- 
tween what he imagines or wishes and what he has really 
seen, and this confusion explains many of his falsehoods. 
Finally, everybody knows his extreme suggestibility, which 
lasts until about the age of 14 years. It is of a complicated 
nature, for it depends on his character as much as on the 
imperfection of his intelligence; in any case this suggestibility 
is another proof of his lack of criticism” (page 122). 
The child in these respects resembles in intelligence the 
adult imbecile, as is shown by the fact that to numerous 
tests the responses of the two exhibit the same defects of 
criticism and direction, the same superficial comprehension, 
and the same random invention. There are, however, 
important advantages to the child because he is still in the 
stage of development. Of these Binet mentions in particular 
the child’s prompt and durable memory (which he probably 
exaggerates), his plasticity, his incessant play and activity, 
and his constant experimentation. He also mentions tests 
in the scale which he considers most suitable for measuring 
each of the four characteristics: e.g., arrangement of weights, 
for “direction”; indicating the prettier of two pictures, 
pointing out differences between pairs of familiar objects 
recalled in memory, and answering comprehension questions, 
for “comprehension” ; definition of familiar objects, descrip- 
tion of pictures, and constructing a sentence to include three 
given words, for both “comprehension” and “invention” ; 
criticizing absurd statements, for “criticism.” 
It is evidently not well to stress very greatly this matter of
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
different tests for different functions, however, for the tests 
of the scale were not made with these functions particularly 
in mind, but were mostly devised long before Binet had 
analyzed out these four functions — indeed, when his views 
of intelligence were somewhat different from those here 
expressed. Furthermore, Binet was an empirical worker to 
the extent that he would not work directly from mental 
function to test, as Kraepelin had done. It is also to be 
noted that distinctions between these four general functions 
or aspects of intelligence are often hard to make. 
BINET WAS VERSATILE AND OPEN-MINDED 
His first series of proposed tests, published in 1896, were, 
to be sure, devised to measure certain preconceived functions, 
and they were based to a very small extent on experimental 
work and correlation; but he departed very far from this 
procedure later, and criticized this method of procedure in 
the case of Kraepelin’s work. Examples can be pointed out, 
however, to show that Binet was not at any time wholly 
free from the practice of devising tests to measure some sort 
of preconceived function supposed to be of major importance 
in intelligence; this, for instance, was the procedure in the 
experiments discussed in the article on attention and adapta- 
tion. It must be acknowledged that a wholly empirical 
method of selecting tests would be a waste of time, and that 
selection according to certain ideas and observations is 
inevitable. Binet was the type of investigator that will 
not allow himself to be too greatly biased by his own theory, 
and he showed considerable willingness to cast aside any view 
that did not test out well. For instance, his early stress on 
memory gave way later to an exaltation of attention, and 
this seemingly later to adaptation, probably as the essence 
of attention; then at the time of the making of the first scale 
judgment was supreme; and finally he found intelligence so
-P-A-G-E-281
  The Manifestations of Intelligence 267 
complex that several chief characters received the emphasis 
— direction, comprehension, invention, and auto-criticism. 
If he had lived longer, he would certainly have found diffi- 
culties in the way of keeping these functions appreciably 
distinct, and would doubtless have tried other characteriza- 
tions of intelligence. 
EMOTIONS, INSTINCTS, AND SPECIAL TALENTS 
It may be well to mention here again the fact that Binet did 
not mean to exclude from intelligent behavior the emotions 
and instincts, but he seems to have regarded them as motiva- 
tions or drives, as Woodworth regards them. To Binet it was 
the emotions and instincts that determine our ends, what 
we work and struggle for; while the “elements of thought,” 
which we have described, determined the means to their 
attainment. Throughout his productive period, as far as 
tests are concerned, Binet recognized to a considerable extent 
certain special talents or aptitudes, and he made detailed 
studies of certain talented individuals. In his Idées modernes 
sur les enfants he put very great stress on the need of educat- 
ing each child according to his aptitudes.

  CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
Prosiems Reearpine INTELLIGENCE AND Uses or TrEstTs 
THE INTERRELATIONS OF MENTAL FUNCTIONS 
Tue characterizations of intelligence as given in the fore- 
going chapter are as far as Binet got, and psychologists have 
not yet added a great deal to what this pioneer in intelligence 
testing accomplished in this regard, except that tests and 
quantitative methods have of late~received considerable 
development. Stern, as we have noted, took up Binet’s 
view of adaptation as the characteristic of attention, as held 
in the latter’s article on this subject published in 1900, and 
he made this in his own view the essence of intelligence. 
But Binet’s views developed very materially beyond this 
point. Stern’s definition of intelligence, thus arrived at, 
seems to have been taken up too uncritically by the majority 
of educators, and even of psychologists, at the present time. 
In the face of very little evidence many writers are practically 
identifying intelligence with the “ability to learn,” without 
specifying which ability this is. The correlations among 
learning rates in different kinds of performance are not 
encouragingly high (179, 128, 171). Learning ability seems 
now to be no more homogeneous and simple than is the 
collection of mental operations known as sensory discrimina- 
tion, attention, imagery, memory, judgment, reasoning, etc., 
if, indeed, these are not in the main the same things as the 
processes involved in different learning adjustments, but 
viewed from another angle as it were. 
TWO OPPOSITE EXTREME VIEWS AND THEIR EXPERIMENTAL

The question of the interrelation of the various factors 
constituting “general ability” or intelligence was early 
268

  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 269 
investigated experimentally with the use of the correlation 
method of Pearson. We have already noted that Wissler 
obtained evidence of very little or no relationship among 
the abilities tested in Cattell’s early investigations.! 
Thorndike’s multiple-factor view. Data and conclusions 
published the next year after this report appeared, by Aikins, 
Thorndike, and Miss Hubbell (2), were in general agreement 
with Wissler’s results. These latter investigators assert that 
“any consideration of the nervous basis of mental life or of 
the patent facts of human nature suggests a priori that it is 
more rational to look on the mind as a multitude of particular 
capacities, all of which may be highly independent of each 
other” (page 374). Various studies are cited in support of 
this view, and it is backed by their own experiments, which 
attempt to measure particular functions that depend on 
quickness as well as on accuracy in the association of “certain 
thoughts or acts with certain percepts either directly or in- 
directly through other ideas which the percepts call up. 
The associations were in every case such as involved (in the 
subjects tested) attentive selection of correct and purposive 
inhibition of incorrect ideas” (ibid.). 
The tests used were certain cancellation and association 
tests now well known. The results obtained were interpreted 
as enforcing Thorndike’s view of special abilities as just 
stated. Quickness of association, as a general ability deter- 
mining the speed of all one’s associations, was declared to be 
a myth. Speed and accuracy in finding words containing 7 , 
and e does not involve anything like equal accuracy in finding 
misspellings. “Our results,” they say, “‘also suggest the 
possibility of clearly defining the classes of functions which 
we may expect to find closely related” (page 375). Thorn- 
dike soon after the appearance of this report, published a 
book on educational psychology (212), which is based upon 
1 Supra, pages 108 f.

the position here taken and which has had very much influ- 
ence in this country. 
Spearman’s view of a general factor. In 1904 Spearman 
committed himself to a position, based on careful experi- 
mentation and statistical determinations, which is extreme 
in just the opposite direction. “All branches of intellectual 
activity,” he says, “have in common one fundamental 
function (or group of functions), whereas the remaining or 
specific elements of the activity seem in every case to be 
wholly different from that in all the others” (198, page 284). 
This is the famous two-factor theory of intelligence as opposed 
to the multiple-factor theory of Thorndike, and it maintains 
that any mental function involves something of the general- 
intelligence factor and also some specific factor that is dis- 
crete so far as other such specific factors are concerned. The 
extreme view here taken has been of late years somewhat 
modified. 
Spearman points out that former investigators who had 
found low correlations among the several test scores of their 
subjects had neglected to measure the reliability of their 
results; had wholly disregarded the question of the homo- 
geneity of their subjects as to age, training, zeal, endurance, 
etc.; and had not corrected their coefficients or correlation 
for errors of observation. He maintains that the neglect of 
these errors and precautions has tended to lower their coeffi- 
cients. Choosing for his tests a number of simple and sup- 
posedly elementary functions, in whose study the results 
are least affected by “irregularities, complications, and un- 
known factors,” he carried out a large number of carefully 
controlled experiments in which the tests were repeated so 
that a check on their reliability would be possible. Thus 
from a few sensory discrimination tests which could be con- 
trolled best he hoped evidently to get relations that are true 
of all discrimination when irrelevant factors are removed.
-P-A-G-E-285
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 271 
He shows that by correcting his coefficients for “attenua- 
tion” with a formula of his own, then but recently developed 
(197), very high coefficients of relationship can be obtained 
between the sensory discrimination processes tested and 
general intelligence as determined by the estimates of 
teachers, of comrades, and of the rector’s wife (on the basis 
of “common sense”’), and by school standing, coefficients 
showing practically a one-to-one relationship. 
Spearman points out that his theory may be tested by the 
possibility of making a hierarchical arrangement of the 
correlation coefficients, an arrangement of such a nature 
that the coefficients will decrease successively both in the 
columns, say, to the right and also in the rows downward. 
This hierarchical arrangement cannot be expected, however, 
if the coefficients are not reliable and are complicated by 
various irrelevant factors and by errors of observation. He 
, claims in this article that the hierarchical arrangement of the 
corrected coefficients obtained by him is a practical demon- 
stration of the correctness of his theory that intelligence 
involves a general common factor. He and Krueger again 
support the general-intelligence-factor theory in a later 
study (199). 
Binet’s reaction to Spearman’s conclusion. This study 
opened up a controversy that is yet unsettled, but it probably 
reveals too great a confidence in mathematical refinements 
of meager and imperfect data. Though Binet, reviewing 
Spearman’s article in the Année for 1905, referred to this work 
as very interesting and original, he was not greatly impressed, 
and less influenced in his later work, by Spearman’s results. 
With reference to Spearman’s findings, that the corrected 
correlation between sensory discrimination and general in- 
telligence is practically perfect, Binet says: “He regards 
this conclusion as profoundly important. It may possibly be. 
We ourselves are profoundly astonished at the conclusion 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
272 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
because of the very defective character both of the sensory 
experiments of the author and of the manner in which he 
determined or had others determine general intelligence [as 
a criterion with which to correlate the tests]. Before com- 
mitting oneself it is necessary to wait until other investi- 
gators obtain similar results” (page 624). 
Burt's experiments interpreted as favoring Spearman’s view. 
In 1909 Burt (82) carried out a thorough and extensive study 
of the nature of general intelligence. As subjects he used 
two groups of boys in Oxford, England. One of these groups 
was in the superior elementary schools and represented 
socially the middle class; the other was in a high-class pre- 
paratory school and consisted of children of the professional 
class. The performances of the latter group manifested a 
superior degree of intelligence, and in this regard agreed with 
the results of other studies of class differences which we have 
already considered. Results of various tests of perceptual 
discrimination, reaction time (simple and discriminative), 
immediate memory, mirror learning, and range of apprehen- 
sion were correlated with estimates of intelligence by teachers, 
head masters, and fellow students. The coefficients of rela- 
tionship obtained were interpreted to support the general- 
factor theory of intelligence. ‘We may agree,’’ the author 
says, “that so-called ‘voluntary’ attention is, of all recog- 
nized psychological processes, the essential factor in general 
intelligence” (page 169). This common factor, he supposes, 
runs through all mental operations, increasing in amount, 
as it were, from the elementary sensory processes up through 
the higher processes to reasoning. This factor of general 
intelligence Burt found also to be hereditary, probably follow- 
ing the Mendelian Law. 
Brown’s experiments support Thorndike. In the year 
following this report there appeared an article by William 
Brown (77), of King’s College, London, who employed tests 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 273 
in the addition of digits, cancellation, dividing of lines into 
halves and thirds, illusions in visual perception, speed of 
uncontrolled association, memory of nonsense syllables and 
of poetry, and the Ebbinghaus completion test. School 
marks in drawing, total school marks, and two independent 
teachers’ estimates of ability were also used. Nearly all the 
tests were given twice, for purposes of studying effects of cor- 
rection of correlation coefficients for attenuation. Brown’s 
‘results were interpreted as contradicting the two-factor 
theory of Spearman, since they failed to form a hierarchical 
order of coefficients. Brown and Thomson, especially the 
latter, have continued to combat this theory in numerous 
studies which run beyond the range of time covered in this 
book. In this article Brown criticizes the attenuation 
formula as leading to error unless all the “observational 
errors”’ are unrelated, which he finds they are not. 
Additional experiments and conclusions. Thorndike and 
some of his students (217) investigated this problem, using 
tests on accuracy of estimating the length of lines as deter- 
mined by attempting to draw lines equal in length to a 
standard, and accuracy in estimating weight as shown by 
attempting to reproduce a standard weight by filling a box 
with the necessary quantity of shot. The intelligence of 
the subjects, who were high and normal school students, was 
estimated by teachers and by fellow students. Correlations 
between the discrimination functions and intelligence were 
very low, thus contradicting, as did Brown’s experiment, 
the general factor of Spearman. Various later experiments 
have yielded similar results. It is questionable, however, 
whether these tests have met the conditions laid down by 
Spearman to test the theory. 
There can be little doubt that a somewhat median position 
between the extreme early views of Spearman, on the one 
hand, and of Thorndike, on the other, is nearer the truth.    
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Neither view seems to be supported by a consideration of. 
the neuromuscular bases of behavior. At any rate, that 
intelligence is associated with biological structures which are 
complete in development at a comparatively early age — at 
about 16 years of age — may now be regarded as established ; 
also that the relative degree of one’s general efficiency at 
any given age is largely determined by heredity. 
CAN INTELLIGENCE BE IMPROVED BY TRAINING? BINET’S 
POSITION 
Binet did not discriminate closely between innate intelli- 
gence factors and the improvement of these factors by 
training. There is, of course, a degree of plasticity or 
training possibility in any mental function, so that-with any 
degree of innate ability the efficiency of the individual can 
be considerably increased by systematic and well-directed 
training. This fact was recognized by Binet; and meaning 
by the term “intelligence” to designate one’s abilities in a 
general way, he included both the elements due more directly 
to innate organization and those due to training. On this 
view it was natural for him to take the position — contrary 
to the one usually taken today by psychologists — that in- 
telligence can be improved by training. In Les idées modernes 
sur les enfants, which summarizes much of his life’s work and 
certainly gives some of his ripest views, Binet reacts against 
what he calls the “brutal pessimism” (page 141) of those who 
regard intelligence as a fixed quantity that cannot be in- 
creased. This pessimism, he says, has led to a lack of 
interest in backward children and to a consequent danger to 
society. He admits that if he had been asked five or six 
years earlier to back up his opinion by arguments, he would 
have had nothing but theoretical reasons to bring forward. 
He would have shown, for example, that instruction and 
education go together and interact upon each other; that
-P-A-G-E-289
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 275 
certain kinds of instruction impart ideas which regulate, to 
some extent, one’s conduct and so actually influence one’s 
ability. He would have offered particular examples of young 
men who have returned less naive and more active and 
resourceful after a foreign voyage or a year or two in the 
military service. But he would have taken special advantage 
of the information furnished by experimental psychology, 
which, he asserts, has proved that “all that we have of 
thought and function is susceptible of development. Every 
time that one has taken the trouble to repeat methodically 
a work the effect of which can be measured, one has obtained 
results that can be represented by a characteristic curve 
which merits the name of a curve of progress” (pages 141 ff.). 
“Now if one considers that intelligence is not a single, 
indivisible function with a particular essence of its own,” 
he argues, “but that it is formed by the combination of all 
the minor functions of discrimination, observation, and 
retention, all of which have been proved to be plastic and 
| subject to increase, it will seem incontestable that the same 
law governs the ensemble and its elements, and that con- 
sequently the intelligence of any one is susceptible of develop- 
ment. With practice, enthusiasm, and especially with 
method one can succeed in increasing one’s attention, - 
memory, and judgment, and in becoming literally more 
intelligent than before; and this progress will go on until 
one reaches one’s limit. And... what is important in 
order to act intelligently is not so much the force of the 
faculties as the manner of using them; that is to say, as the 
art of intelligence, which art is necessarily capable of being 
refined by practice” (page 143). 
In what he considered his justification by facts, Binet cites 
the remarkable progress made by children in the special 
classes organized by him and certain schoolmen for retarded 
children. The children chosen for these classes were re-
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
tarded three years in their school work despite their having 
been regular in attendance. After a year’s training in these 
schools they were found to be only two years retarded, having 
made up an extra year in addition to the normal progress of 
one year. To the objection that this progress was due only 
to instruction, that it shows only the possibility of rapidly 
educating the ignorant when conditions are especially 
favorable, Binet replies: ‘They were not merely ignorant 
persons; all had a mental defect, a weakness of attention, 
a feebleness of comprehension, or some other limitation. 
And it was this defect that prevented them from profiting 
by the instructions given in the ordinary classes by the usual 
methods. In the special schools the instruction has been 
assimilated; that is a fact. Habits of work, of attention, 
and of effort have been acquired ;* this is another fact, and 
this second fact is even more important than the first. 
What is the exact part of instruction in this result and what 
that of intelligence? That would be extremely difficult 
to know, and perhaps it would be useless to try to find it out; 
for the production of an individual, his social utility, his 
functional value, depends on these two factors together. 
The mind of such a child is like a field the method of cultiva- 
tion of which has been changed by a wise farmer, with the 
result that the ground once a waste land now bears fruit. 
It is in this practical sense, the only one applicable here, 
that we say that the intelligence of these children has been 
augmented. The thing that has been augmented is what 
constitutes the intelligence of the pupil, the capacity to learn 
and to assimilate the instruction” (page 146). There is 
evidently a little confusion of thought in these passages. 
BINET’S “MENTAL ORTHOPEDICS” 
The process of increasing the practical intelligence of 
child Binet called mental orthopedics. “‘Having on our hand:
-P-A-G-E-291
  
Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 277 
children who did not know how to listen, to pay attention, to 
keep quiet, we pictured our first duty as being not to teach 
them the facts that we thought would be most useful, but 
to teach them how to learn. We have therefore devised, with 
the aid of M. Belot and all our other collaborators, what we 
call exercises of mental orthopedics. The word is expressive 
and has come into favor. One can guess its meaning. In 
the same way that physical orthopedics straightens a crooked 
spine, mental orthopedics strengthens, cultivates, and for- 
tifies attention, memory, perception, judgment, and will” 
(page 150). 
This practice, to which Binet had apparently given a good 
deal of attention, consisted of such characteristic exercises 
as keeping oneself absolutely immobile for a period of time, 
carrying a cup full of water without spilling any out, exert- 
ing all one’s strength in a prolonged pressure on the dyna- 
mometer, and naming groups of objects or of pictures of 
objects which had been viewed for a short time. Binet’s 
method differs somewhat from that of Seguin (187), a famous 
teacher of defectives, “who,” say Binet and Simon (60, 
page 3) ‘“‘showed experimentally how one may, by dint of 
much ingenuity and patience, increase the intelligence and 
improve the character of some of these unfortunate children.” 
In a note on the page cited they say that ‘“‘Seguin’s work must 
not be examined too closely; those who praise it have 
certainly not read it. Seguin impresses us as an empiric, en- 
dowed with great personal talent, which he has succeeded in 
embodying clearly in his works. These contain some pages 
of good sense, with many obscurities, and many absurdities.”” 
Yet Binet has clearly drawn somewhat upon Seguin’s work. 
PHYSICAL BASES OF MENTAL DEFECT: MEDICAL TREATMENT 
As to the causes and physical bases of mental deficiency, 
Binet and Simon summarize as follows what they say is 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
278 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
known: “The dominant etiological feature is that mental 
deficiency and want of balance depend upon hereditary 
conditions, or conditions acquired in the earliest stages of 
development. By hereditary conditions must be under- 
stood strictly those which result from alterations in the germ 
cells of the parents. An intoxication alone seems capable 
of exercising upon the latter a sufficiently general action to 
reach the germ cells, and by far the most frequent poison is 
alcohol. By acquired conditions must be understood the 
results of diseases of the foetus or of infancy, and especially 
the cerebral complications of the infectious fevers — e.g., 
meningitis in the course of an eruptive fever. In all such 
cases, with rare exceptions to be mentioned immediately, by 
the time the mental deficiency is discovered, its causes are 
no longer active, and consequently cannot be affected by 
medical intervention” (60, page 102). The exceptions 
referred to are (1) the ingestion of thyroid glands from 
sheep for cases of threatening cretinism, (2) the giving of 
bromides (in cases of epilepsy) and treatment by hydro- 
therapy, both of which means “enable the subject to master 
the emotional reactions which are habitually exaggerated,” 
and (3) the moral influence that the physician can give to 
assist the educative work of the teacher in the special school, 
his advice and suggestive effects being intended here and not 
hypnotism (pages 104-106). 
TRANSFER EFFECTS ON INTELLIGENCE PROBABLY TEMPORARY 
Even though Binet was less inclined than are present-day 
psychologists to draw closely the distinction between the 
effects of a conceivable innate organization determining the 
possibilities of intelligence, on the one hand, and the effects of 
training, on the other, and was therefore likely to consider 
favorably the possibility of increasing one’s intelligence by 
training, the various uses which he suggested or actually made 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 279 
of intelligence tests were practically those recognized today, 
except that more uses have developed with greater experience. 
Binet in no place shows any hope of considerably improving 
one’s degree of intelligence, unless it should be in the case of 
cretinism. That there are transfer effects of training which 
may temporarily somewhat increase one’s efficiency in certain 
rather general mental functions, no experimental psychologist 
can now well deny; but it is well not to regard this as an in- 
crease in intelligence, as Binet evidently regarded it. There 
is probably no good evidence that such improvement, even 
as it might be shown in intelligence tests, is permanent. It 
seems to fade away with lack of practice. 
BINET A PIONEER IN EDUCATIONAL TESTS 
Binet distinguished between intelligence tests and educa- 
tional tests, or what he termed tests of instruction, just as 
we distinguish between them today; and, with the help of 
M. Vaney, he and Simon worked out and published age-level 
scales for testing the instructional status of defectives in 
reading, arithmetic, and spelling, scales of which they say 
they made much use (60, pages 52 ff.). They established by 
experimentation the average acquirement of all school chil- 
dren of each age from 6 to 11, 12, or 13 years, the upper limit 
varying for different tests. The children used for these 
norms were taken independently of their school classification, 
this plan being preferred to that of taking the acquirements 
of only the typical children, those of the proper grade classi- 
fication for their ages. The method of standardization 
accepted by them in the establishment of these norms was 
regarded as being less artificial than the other one and as 
giving norms that are more nearly true expressions of actual 
conditions. They found that these norms were lower than 
those obtained by taking only typical children. 
The arithmetic scale was published as early as 1905 by
-P-A-G-E-294
  280 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Vaney ! (224), having apparently been standardized on the 
reactions of 293 children; and the reading and spelling scales, 
together with the arithmetic scale containing only a sample 
problem for each age, appeared in Les enfants anormaux, 1907, 
and also in Les idées modernes sur les enfants, 1909. These 
scales were in age units, so that the educational age of a child 
could be determined and compared with his chronological age, 
or with the score normal to his age, due allowance being made 
for any irregularities in school opportunity. The idea of 
developing other scholastic tests was explicitly entertained. 
“Tt would be possible, and indeed easy, we believe,” said 
Binet in 1909, “to add some typical interrogations on history, 
on geography, and on the sciences, and to grade exercises in 
composition” (42, page 26). The reading test developed by 
Binet was administered individually, requiring not more than 
ten minutes for each child (page 33). 
EDUCATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF IDIOTS, IMBECILES, 
AND MORONS 
In the rating of defectives for diagnostic purposes these 
investigators gave both mental and “instructional” tests, 
taking note in both cases of the opportunity that the child 
considered had had, as well as of his age. Thus in what they 
called knowledge retardation, measured with the instructional 
scales, they recognize that a 9-year-old child of three years’ 
retardation in knowledge, for instance, was to be regarded 
differently from a 12-year-old child also of three years’ 
retardation, the former having learned absolutely nothing. 
As a result of their studies with these three instructional 
scales, as well as with the intelligence scale, Binet and Simon 
1 Jt appears that Vaney was working under the direction of Binet in this 
investigation. In one place Binet says: “It is my collaborator, M. Vaney, 
who has been charged with this work,” referring to the article here cited. 
In another place he and Simon say that the scales were “arranged with the 
help of M. Vaney” (41, page 25, and 60, page 53). 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 281 
were able in 1907 (60, pages 77 f.) to formulate in educational 
terms definitions of the three main classes of feeble-minded- 
ness. These definitions of idiocy, imbecility, and moronity 
are stated in terms of the child’s ability to learn, as follows: 
Definition of an idiot. ‘An idiot is any child who never learns 
to communicate with his kind by speech — that is to say, one 
who can neither express his thoughts verbally nor understand 
the verbally expressed thoughts of others, this inability being due 
solely to defective intelligence, and not to any disturbance of 
hearing, nor to any affection of the organs of phonation.” A 
normal child of 2 years of age surpasses this limitation in the 
use of language. 
Definition of an imbecile. ‘An imbecile is any child who fails 
to learn how to communicate with his kind by means of writing — 
that is to say, one who can neither express his thoughts in writing, 
nor read writing or print, or, more correctly, understand what 
he reads, this failure being due to defective intelligence, and not 
to any defect of vision or any paralysis of the arms which would 
explain his inability.” A child who does not know his letters 
after having been at school for two years is likely to become 
an imbecile, we are informed. 
Definition of amoron. ‘A moron is one who can communicate 
with his kind by speech or writing, but who shows a retardation 
of two or three years (according to the rules already indicated) 
in his school studies, this retardation not being due to insufficient 
or irregular attendance.” Children who are retarded because 
of the lack of opportunity are, of course, not morons by this 
definition. 
These distinctions are pedagogical, and will easily be made 
by teachers. It may be added here that the two or three 
years’ deficiency in school work is a very unsatisfactory 
criterion, since an absolute retardation of this amount is 
much more serious at an early age than later, when it may 
not indicate that the person is a moron at all. Binet did
-P-A-G-E-296
282 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
not use the intelligence quotient in mental measurement, 
or he could easily have overcome in a general way this | 
difficulty as far as the tests are concerned. The various legal 
definitions, to some of which the reader may have access, 
seek to state the limits of the different degrees of mental 
debility in terms of the subject’s fitness for carrying on a 
normal social life and for assuming economic and moral 
responsibility. Binet recognized that all definitions must 
ultimately be based on criteria of ability to get on in life. 
BINET URGED THAT EDUCATION BE ADAPTED TO 
THE LEARNER’S APTITUDES 
Thus Binet carried his work on defectives to the point of a 
considerable clarification of many problems that had arisen 
both as to classification of these individuals and as to their 
general treatment, and in this work he had developed both | 
intelligence tests and educational tests. This was at a time 
when educational tests were unknown in America.! It seems 
evident that but for Binet’s untimely death, at the age of 
fifty-four, he would have carried his tests fully into the field 
of normal education in the schools. He not only looked 
upon tests of children as very useful both to parents and 
teachers, but he also saw clearly, probably more clearly | 
than most psychologists and educators today see, the need of | 
training each child for a career suitable to his special apti-_ 
tudes; that is, he recognized that the curricula are too con- |   ventional and are based too much on abstractions which a | 
large per cent of the children are incapable of learning, even 
though they may be able to do very good work of a kind that 
the majority of men and women must do in the world. 
In Les idées modernes sur les enfants Binet tells us that in 
the use of tests which stress literary ability and the handling 
of general ideas he found high agreement between the school 
1 Thorndike’s handwriting scale (215) was published in 1910.
-P-A-G-E-297

| Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 283 
directors’ estimates of intelligence and the intelligence-test 
scores, but that tests involving manual skill or the discern- 
ment of sensation differences often ranked highest those who 
were dull in school work of the conventional type. “And I 
understood then what an error was being made in judging 
these children according to tests that were not made for 
minds of their nature, and especially in giving them a kind of 
instruction that was contrary to their intellectual type. . . . 
As for myself, after an already long experience — I have 
been making investigations in the schools for twenty-five 
years — I believe that the determination of children’s apti- 
tudes is the matter of greatest importance in instruction 
and education. It is according to their aptitudes that they 
should be instructed and that they should be directed toward 
a profession” (page 11). In this excellent book Binet dis- 
cusses in an illuminating way the qualifications that a teacher 
of children should have, and shows the need of a knowledge 
of what he called “individual psychology.” He pointed out 
that the teacher should not only know the students from talks 
with them and from close personal contact in general rec- 
reation and in games, but should be acquainted with the 
different kinds of child mentality. Moreover, the teacher 
should be able to give mental tests and, in emergencies, to 
attack new problems experimentally. 
A very definite suggestion is made by Binet as to the 
classification of children in school according to their several 
abilities: “In schools with large enrollments, where the law 
requires the organization of parallel classes, a method of 
sectioning the pupils into such classes on the basis of their 
aptitudes would be possible. In certain classes instruction 
that is of a predominantly literary character might be given, 
in others science would have the first place, and in still 
others the emphasis could be placed on work of a much more 
immediately practical nature and on shop work” (page 13).  
-P-A-G-E-298
  284 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
Certainly the use of tests in the normal educational process 
is to find out each child’s capabilities and to determine 
whether he is doing what he can do with the greatest ad- 
vantage. To measure the effects on one’s abilities of dif- 
ferent kinds of training, of differences in environment and 
in social status, of fatigue, of different motivating conditions, 
etc., is an important field for intelligence tests to supple- 
ment other kinds of measurement. 
THE HEREDITY OF INTELLIGENCE 
The scientific study of heredity has also afforded a useful 
field for intelligence tests. This work early attracted Galton, 
who used not only observational and rating methods but 
actually made certain tests of specific capacities, as we have 
already noted. As early as 1869 Galton (114) published a 
study of 977 eminent men, of whom each-was the most prom- 
inent among about 4000 persons. He found that a high degree 
of innate ability was essential to the attainment of eminence 
however favorable the social advantages, that highly gifted 
individuals are likely to rise to eminence even against un- 
favorable circumstances and social rank, and that genius 
follows laws of heredity as do such traits as height, com- 
plexion, etc. His study of twins (115) is an illustration of his 
use of certain tests, such as imagery tests, in investigating 
effects of heredity as related to those of environment. In 
America, Cattell (89, 90) in studies of scientific men and 
Woods (236) in studies of royal families made good use of 
methods of ranking, while Thorndike (214) as early as 1905 
applied tests to twins in a study of the relative influences of 
heredity and environment. 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS APPLIED TO THE PROBLEM OF RACE 
DIFFERENCES 
The use of Binet’s 1908 scale, as we have already seen, 
raised in several different countries the question of the
-P-A-G-E-299
  
Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 285 
effects of differences in social class and in parentage, and in 
this work it at once became evident that hereditary factors 
played an important réle in differences revealed by the tests. 
From this point there is but a short step to race differences, 
which had already received attention by Rivers and a 
number of other investigators (see 237), who employed chiefly 
sensory discrimination tests. In 1904 Woodworth and Bru- 
ner (237) tested various races in the St. Louis Exposition, 
finding that the keenness of the senses of the races tested 
was “about on a par.” Unfortunately, language difficulties 
and the unsatisfactory development of suitable tests of 
intelligence at that time greatly limited these researches. 
As early as 1895 Bache (6) applied reaction time tests to 
twelve white, eleven Indian, and ten negro subjects, with 
equivocal results. In the next two-year period A. T. Smith 
(196) and Stetson (204) tested negroes in certain memory 
functions; the former studied but a single individual, while 
the latter tested five hundred white and five hundred negro 
children in Washington, D. C. The negroes were slightly 
older than the whites, and they also surpassed them in the 
memory-of-verse tests used. In 1899 McDonald (161) 
applied certain rough sensitivity tests to ninety-one negro 
children. These various early tests were of very little scien- 
tific value, partly because test methods were inadequately 
developed and largely because the tests used were of a kind 
that later were shown to be of little significance as to men- 
tality. Numerous other tests ' have been applied to various 
race groups since the appearance of the Binet intelligence 
scale, and the practical problems regarding race differences 
have been forcefully urged by Brigham (76) and by other 
investigators.

results, will be found in the author’s monograph, “The Comparative Abilities 
of Ra and Negro Children,” Comparative Psychology Monograph, 1923,

  286 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
TESTS IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR STUDIES 
A variety of tests of sensory-motor learning capacity, of 
sensory discrimination, and even of intelligence were applied 
to animals in the early part of this century, before the 
Binet scale appeared to stimulate progress in the testing of 
humans, some of these tests having also more recently been 
applied to man. The general progress in this field may be 
gathered from a few books by such authors as Hobhouse 
(132), Thorndike (216), Washburn (229), and Watson (230). 
In this field an important problem has been how to develop 
tests of intelligence that would be fair to animals of dif- 
ferent forms and instincts. It is obvious that in animal 
forms so different as those that have already been studied, 
intelligence has qualitative variations which cannot be over- 
looked ; that it is not a homogeneous power or faculty in any 
sense of these terms. The experimental work in this field — 
a field, it will be recalled, to which Binet gave some attention 
early in his scientific career but which he influenced only to 
a small extent — makes up one of the best chapters in modern 
psychology, and has in a relatively small range of years 
contributed valuable results on various problems in learning, 
in cerebral functions, in the relative importance and develop- 
ment of different sensory capacities, and inheredity. Indeed, 
the psychologist and educator who is ignorant of the progress 
in this field of psychology is considerably handicapped even 
in his work with humans. 
A SUMMARY OF BINET’S SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE 
USES OF TESTS 
Though Binet everywhere emphasized the practical value 
of tests for the selection and classification of individuals of 
inferior ability, he recognized also the extensive use that can 
be made of a good intelligence scale in the solution of numer-
-P-A-G-E-301
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 287 
ous scientific problems relating to our general social life as 
well as to the work of education in the schools. Indeed, the 
scale was for him but a tool for various kinds of research 
work in psychological problems as well as a means of segre- 
gating persons for purely practical purposes, and in the 
practical applications which he made of the scale he was but 
following, though by more scientific methods, other investi- 
gators or responding to certain needs of his environment. 
In his numerous writings he made and indicated various uses 
of the intelligence scale, but failed to summarize these or to 
gather them together in any one place. It may be well, 
therefore, to mention briefly here the various uses that he 
made of his scale or that he suggested. 
Binet held that the most important application of the tests 
of intelligence was to persons of inferior intelligence (61, 
page 85). He did not recognize explicitly the great value of 
testing for superior intelligence and for outlining for super- 
normal children an education according to their abilities, 
though this was doubtless in his mind or would have been 
urged if he had lived to carry out his idea of sectioning classes 
according to the abilities of the children. As we have already 
seen, he formulated a simple rule for the selection of the 
brightest students in any class, that of choosing the youngest 
children. He was aware that the brighter children were 
usually underrated as to ability by their teachers, because 
of the unfair comparison of them with the older and more 
experienced children of their classes independently of con- 
siderations of age. One of the chief post-Binet developments 
of mental testing has been a more explicit recognition of the 
problem of selecting and training super-normal children 
according to their greater possibilities. At the end of their 
description of the 1905 scale Binet and Simon say: ‘“‘We end 
here the list of tests that we have used. It would have been 
easy to continue the scale by adding more complicated tests, 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
288 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
if one had wished to make a hierarchy of normal children. 
The scale could even be extended for adults to the normal, 
to the intelligent, to the very intelligent, and to the super- 
intelligent, and used to measure, or at least to try to measure, 
talent and genius. We defer to another occasion this diffi- 
cult study” (page 223). This study was apparently never 
attempted by them. 
As to the subnormals, Binet used the intelligence scale in a 
practical way both as a means to their selection for special 
education and to their classification for special treatment. 
In a more scientific and theoretical sense he used it to define 
and characterize the three degrees of feeble-mindedness which 
we have already considered. Among children that had been 
sent to institutions for feeble-minded individuals Binet and 
Simon found some that were normal in intelligence and two 
that were at least one year above normal (61, page 86), and 
they seem to have been very much impressed by the injustice 
of such errors in classification. They point out that certain 
investigations in medicine, such as the effect of thyroid 
treatment on mentally defective children, might be greatly 
facilitated by the appiication of the intelligence tests both 
before and after the treatment (ibid., page 89). Another 
use suggested in the medical field is that of establishing rela- 
tionships between various pathological conditions deter- 
mined by autopsies and intelligence as previously measured 
by the scale. 
Binet and his collaborators made extensive studies, as we 
have already seen, of the relations of various physical and 
mental traits as determined by anthropometric measurements 
on the one hand and intelligence tests and teachers’ estimates 
of mental ability on the other. These studies were useful 
chiefly in making it clear that no very definite relationship 
exists between intelligence and size and shape of the head or 
other physical features measured, contrary to theories that 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 289 
have often been propounded by individuals in different fields 
of science. 
It was evident to Binet that any instrument by means of 
which a trained tester could in less than an hour arrive at a 
juster estimate of a child’s intelligence than that held by his 
teacher or by his parents is very useful to parents, teachers, 
and administrators of justice and of education. With the 
knowledge afforded by such measurements as could be made 
with the intelligence scale, to supplement their information 
from other sources, they could have a fair idea of the child’s 
possibilities and therefore adapt instruction to his particular 
needs. 
In the determination of the degree of responsibility of 
persons charged with criminal acts the scale would be very 
useful so far as subnormals, as distinct from those suffering 
from functional disorders, are concerned. 
THE TESTING OF SOLDIERS 
As early as 1908 Binet became active in urging the desira- 
bility of testing young men who are to be taken into the 
army, so as to eliminate those who ar@incapacitated for such 
service. Investigations had been carried out in the German 
army with a view to devising tests for the detection of defec- 
tives, so that they might be saved from the maladjustment 
and even the suicide that experience showed was so frequent 
in the lives of these unfortunate persons in the army. In 
February, 1905, a commission under the leadership of Pro- 
fessor Ziehen had studied this situation in Germany and had 
developed certain mental examinations designed to eliminate 
defectives. These consisted of questions to be answered, of 
the digit span test, of the giving by the subject of the days 
of the week and the months of the year, of the repetition 
of a story that had just been told by the examiner, of the 
Ebbinghaus completion test, and of the construction of a
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
sentence to include four given words (4). Binet seems not 
to have been aware of this work, but he knew of a ques- 
tionnaire prepared by the psychiatrist Dr. Schultze, which 
was so designed that a 12-year-old child of average intelli- 
gence, even though without culture, could pass it. He 
tells us in a footnote (page 94) that he had taken up the ques- 
tion of testing recruits in the French army with the Minister 
of War, who replied that he would ask for a report on the 
matter by his bureau. Binet hoped to be able to report to 
his readers in the near future that tentative experiments on 
the testing of recruits were in progress. Subsequent events 
showed that he had not counted sufficiently on the selfishness 
of human nature; that the psychiatrists on whom rested the 
responsibility of eliminating feeble-minded persons from the 
army were not ready to let him seemingly encroach upon 
their duties, however ill performed they were. 
In 1910 Binet and Simon published an article (63) in which 
they inform us of the progress of the proposed army testing. 
Soon after bringing the question to the attention of the Minis- 
ter of War they had asked for an authorization to make in 
a regiment some experimental trials, thus carrying their tests 
into a field that was new to them. Dr. Simonin, professor 
of legal medicine at Val-de-Grace, was consulted as to an 
opportunity for giving some of the preliminary tests. He 
selected from among the convalescents in his hospital service 
the subjects to be tested, and was present himself at the tests, 
which Binet and Simon call only some preliminary gropings, 
only eleven individuals being tested at the time. As a 
result of such observations and without direct acquaintance 
and experience with the tests, we are told, Simonin made a 
report (195) to a congress of psychiatrists of the French 
language, held at Nantes, on a trial of mental tests in the 
army. He apparently presented the matter as if he had 
himself carried out the tests. Dr. Roubinovitch, one of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 291 
psychiatrists present at the congress, tells us that Simonin 
in his criticism of the tests had the full support of all the 
members present (46, page 479). 
The opinion of the psychiatrists was against the tests in 
the army. They held that intelligence tests alone cannot 
lead to a certain diagnosis of mental retardation, but that, on 
the contrary, they may lead to veritable errors because of 
the emotions aroused in the subjects when confronted for the 
first time with these tests in the strange environment. 
Simonin concluded that a proper diagnosis required not only 
mental tests that are adapted to each individual, but also, 
and especially, a thorough “biological observation” including 
inquiry into hereditary and personal antecedents, as well as 
into the general somatic conditions of the several subjects. 
The psychiatrists considered the tests of Binet and Simon 
as entirely too mechanical and simple and much too short to 
give an exact picture of the subject’s mental condition, and 
there is evidence in their discussion that they were in the 
main ignorant of the development of the intelligence scale 
and of the scientific requirements of objectivity in any such 
means of measurement. 
Binet and Simon seem to have been stirred up by the hasty 
and unjust method by which Simonin brought his criticism 
of their proposed army tests before the important meeting 
of the psychiatrists and secured their support in his opposi- 
tion. Referring to their preliminary tests, they say in the 
summary in the Année: “These are the preliminary gropings 
at which Dr. Simonin was simply present, that he reports in 
his communication; he adds to them only some errors and 
rashness of interpretation, which are explained by his 
ignorance of our views, and which he would have spared 
himself if he had consulted us” (page 476). 
Since Simonin had from these preliminary trials drawn 
conclusions as to the method in general, Binet and Simon  
-P-A-G-E-306
292 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
find it advisable to state their ideas themselves, this being 
the first time they had expressed them. Every year, they 
say, a number of young soldiers, who had been admitted into 
the army by a general “good for the service” characterization 
not based on an examination of their mentality, are dis- 
charged for insufficient intelligence. These they propose to 
eliminate on entrance, not after some time in the army spent 
in maladjustments and personal distress. The number of 
those to be eliminated is not large, probably not even 1 per 
cent of the conscripts; but the difficulties of eliminating them 
are increased by the necessity of having the tests short and 
also by the possibilities of simulation on the part of the 
subjects. 
The authors do not propose merely to apply to the soldiers 
the intelligence scale as worked out in the 1908 revision, but 
they state explicitly that the process of testing must be 
adapted to the end which it is to serve. Preliminary tests 
would be necessary to determine whether the methods 
adopted would eliminate the individuals actually found in 
the life of the barracks to be inefficient; that is, degree of 
efficiency in the army would have to be the criterion on which 
to evaluate and perfect the tests. Moreover, the authors 
state that they would find by investigation, and not by any 
preconceived notion, just what intellectual level is necessary 
for one to be a successful soldier, a level that is presumably 
not very high. The absurdity of Simonin’s statement to the 
psychiatrists as to the length of time required for the testing 
of each subject is evident, they point out, from the fact that 
they had applied only a few preliminary tests to get an idea 
of which tests to use and which to drop out. 
A third point to establish by preliminary experimentation 
would be that of deciding upon a method of eliminating 
rapidly from the examination all the normal men, so that the 
individual tests would be given only to the relatively few
-P-A-G-E-307
Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 293 
about whom there might be some question. It would be 
ridiculous, Binet and Simon point out, to test all the recruits 
in just the same way. In their opinion a first elimination of 
normal individuals could be made by excluding from the 
examination all the students and graduates of medical schools 
and of higher educational institutions, and also the men of 
certain trades which require a fair degree of intelligence. 
“Tn the second place,” they add, “group tests are possible” 
(page 477). After these two siftings for the inefficient they 
suppose that only four or five doubtful cases in each hundred 
would remain to be studied by individual tests. Simulation 
would not complicate the matter, because the tests would 
be arranged in a hierarchy beginning with tests that an 
imbecile could pass as well as a normal person; so that those 
attempting to deceive could not easily be consistent, espe- 
cially as they would not know what scores would be possible 
to persons of different degrees of intelligence. 
Finally, Binet and Simon point out that the objections by 
the psychiatrists to the proposed tests are ill founded from 
another standpoint ; for this work of sifting out and locating 
the persons of mental deficiency is not intended to supplant 
the medical and biological examinations. On the contrary, 
it would only serve, as far as these examinations are con- 
cerned, to indicate the individuals most in need of them. 
It was thus obviously the intention of the psychological 
testers to confine their attention only to cases of mental 
deficiency, and not to attempt to give psychiatric examina- 
tions to the mentally disorganized. 
The opposition to the proposed army testing seems to have 
been great enough to frustrate the plan of Binet. This 
opposition, together with the death of Binet in 1911, left to 
the American psychologists (240, 241) in the World War the 
carrying out for the first time and on a big scale of a plan 
which in many of its details as to procedure and method
-P-A-G-E-308
294 Early Conceptions and Tests of Intelligence 
was worked out by Binet, but which was also independently 
developed in America. The American army testing was, 
however, largely an indirect product of the work on tests by 
the great French psychologist, whose experiments so greatly 
influenced testing in this country. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF BINET’S WORK AND ATTITUDE 
Hardly a field has been entered by the more recent develop- 
ments in psychology that this great genius did not actually 
work out in a measure or plan for future work. He recog- 
nized that society is organized on a poor basis as to the 
selection of individuals for the different kinds of work 
demanded by human welfare, and he pointed out as a more 
ideal project for future psychological work the development 
of tests and other scientific procedures for the better organi- 
zation of social life and for better vocational selection, 
education, and guidance, so that each individual could work 
at that for which he is most fit by nature. This program is 
yet, at the close of the first quarter of the twentieth century, 
largely a hope of the future; but it is an inviting field of 
endeavor for those persons who are sincerely devoted to the 
good of humanity, and already certain notable efforts by 
psychologists have at least indicated that the plan is not a 
mere idle dream. These contributions by tests of various 
kinds will, of course, in no sense take the place of the great 
work of education, of training each generation and of educat- 
ing men to use to the greatest advantage the contributions 
of past generations; they will only help make such training 
and education more effective than at present. 
The contributions of Alfred Binet toward the solution of 
problems of the sort that we have considered in the foregoing 
pages — due to his great industry, his keen practical sense, 
his versatility, his readiness to try in an empirical manner 
one means after another and to give up cherished opinions
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  Problems of Intelligence and Uses of Tests 295 
when they proved of little value — will stand as landmarks 
to encourage those who must go farther than he could go in 
his day, and who must yet continue to push a long way 
the analyses of the complex response and appreciation possi- 
bilities of the biological organizations which we know as 
personalities. 
EXERCISES 
1. Make a bibliography of the Thorndike-Spearman controversy 
to the present time. State the chief developments in the problem 
in later years and the reason why Spearman holds that Thorndike 
and his students have really not met the conditions which test the 
theory. Why is Spearman’s theory called a two-factor theory ? 
2. How do you account for the differences in results obtained by 
the Spearman school and the Thorndike school ? 
8. What effects does practice in taking intelligence tests have on 
one’s efficiency in tests which one has not seen (the transfer effects) ? 
Get definite facts from the periodical literature. Do these facts 
justify the view that intelligence can be increased in an adult by 
training? Why? Suppose one should contend that intelligence 
tests afford better material for mental discipline than do the ancient 
languages; that they give better motivation in the competition for 
high marks; that they represent better material for stressing judg- 
ment and other higher mental functions; and that they train one 
in more useful and practical functions than do the ancient languages. 
What can you say for and against this contention? (Remember 
that the uses of intelligence tests do not include that of training the 
intellect.) 
4. Now write out again the very best definition of intelligence 
that you can formulate.
